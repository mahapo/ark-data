Dr. C. G. Jungreferred to these events, such as telepathy and precognition, as synchronousphenomena. I am morally certain that attitudes toward these phenomena willchange in the foreseeable future, but at the moment any ideas that have theslightest breath of being paranormal or synchronous are highly charged andemotional issues that have a mystical or superstitious connotation. As I understand from my reading and conversations on quantum theory, we exist inwhat I visualize as a sort of quantum soup, wherein what we experience as solidmatter is actually the binding energies at an extreme end of the electromagneticspectrum, the opposite end to the more familiar energies such as light and heat.If we were to venture into this end of the spectrum, thoughts would have thesame validity or reality as solid matter. The Brooklyn Bridge is real; no onewould dispute that. But its design had its inception in thought, didn’t it? The paranormal is so inherently fascinating that for any valid conclusions to bereached from investigation, a searching and objective skepticism must leaven thedesire to discover wonders. The greatest obstacle to a clearer understanding ofthese matters is the overly naive willingness to believe virtually any“authority” on esoteric matters. This in turn has generated hordes of fraudulentexploitation that has done much damage to the validity of investigation intothese subjects. As a hardwired survival characteristic, the human mind has a highly developedpattern-recognition system built into it. However, like any other tool, theresults of its use are limited to the skill of the user—in this case, theobjectivity of the searcher and observer. Wisdom is where you find it, noquestion about that. But if you look in the usual places, you are only likely tofind someone at the end of a psychic hotline whose pattern-recognition skillshave shown him or her how to profit from your search for answers. This is much like the semi-mystical hysteria that clouded even trainedscientific minds when dealing with the issue of powered manned flight—issuesthat were solved by the triumph of a rational engineering approach over what canonly be described as a superstitious alchemical approach. These two issues,mechanical flight and what might be called mental flight, are closely parallelin that the symbolic as well as the practical implications are of suchtremendous significance that the emotional aspect tends to cloud publicperception of them. Just look at the muddle-headed mistakes that were made bythe early experimenters in human flight: Samuel Pierpont Langley, a trainedastronomer whose catapult-launched Great Aerodrome nearly drowned his test pilotCharles Manley; Hiram Maxim, an otherwise competent engineer and inventor whoseoverly large aircraft designs never succeeded in getting off the ground; andOctave Chanute, a trained and successful civil engineer whose hang gliders neverflew. Unbelievable stuff, from our modern viewpoint, isn’t it? The value of this book is that it takes a rational and scientific approach toesoteric subjects, opening a valid door to an avenue of wonder and the mostfascinating implications. This it does in plain words—one sure way of spottingthe opportunist and the fraud is by their employment of a specialized esotericvocabulary, deliberately obscure phraseology, and defensive or arrogantattitudes in the presentation of their material. This book is blessedly free ofany taint of this. Please note that I do not think of technical terms asesoteric. Survival is observation, pattern recognition, and objective analysis, whereasblind faith is walking blindly to destruction. Yet survival at its barest levelis merely scraping along at its pragmatic best. Even scientific intuition has astrong element of what can be called faith. Certainly many of the greatest mindsin the history of science, both past and present, have seen no conflict betweena sense of the Divine and scientific thought. In fact, the closer you look at things, great or small, the more miraculous theyare (observation was in fact the original basis for all the world’s religiousbeliefs). If you do the research, you will see that this is literallytrue—organic life, star formation, the vast and the unimaginably small, all arebound together in an infinitely beautiful magical pattern. So the illusory conflict between survival (which is closely related toscientific thought) and Divine faith is evidently not a simple division of thepractical and the mystical. Mythology, as defined by Joseph Campbell, is themechanism by which the human psyche relates to the chaos of an infiniteenvironment. The various types of human mythos are composed of what Jung calledthe archetypes, symbols with the power to release the stored energy of the humanpsyche. Sounds like quantum physics, doesn’t it? Inner Paths to Outer Space shows a direct path into the realm of thesearchetypes and provides access to the energies inherent to your mind. My owncreative experiences and profession are closely related to the investigationsand speculations in this book. My job is to paint visionary pictures, from myown vision quest as well as from the interpretation of the visions of others.The art I produce is a practical form of magic that provides physical access tothe imaginary realm. This book would have formed the basis for my own visionquest had it only been written earlier, but it shines with fascination to mindsof all ages. It is a signpost to avenues by which the mind can see into themagical workings of creation in ways beyond the everyday human experience. To me, though, the most fascinating aspect of this book is the implications thatthis research material has on what I think of as the psychic component of theevolutionary process. The physical process has gone quite far enough—so far, infact, that human geopolitical affairs have reached a stage that can only bedescribed as critical. By this I mean that the human intellect (as distinguishedfrom what I might call the psychic intellect), which has evolved with the restof our physical selves, has by itself created grave problems of such complexitythat they now constitute a crisis similar in magnitude to those that in pastepochs have served to trigger physical evolutionary changes. This is no longerthe type of regional pressure that previously initiated evolutionarydevelopment, but rather a global crisis of a magnitude such that furtherphysical changes are no longer sufficient to deal with it. These are problemsthat only a psychic evolution will be able to unravel. The human mind hascreated these problems for us with its vaulting advances in technology, and itlies with the heretofore-untapped component of our minds to find solutions tothese problems. The way to these solutions lies ahead of us, not back to somechildish pre-technical primitivism. When you consider the astounding adaptability that Nature displays everywhere welook, the notion of psychic evolution is not as fanciful as it might at firstseem. If you carefully consider how the human body has evolved to adjust toevery aspect of its surroundings, it is certainly not farfetched to wonder howfar beyond the purely physical that the human mind is equipped to go. I can easily see that the implications of the ideas and results discussed inthis book will be the starting point for some of the most rewardingpsychophysical discoveries this century will produce. image [images/00003.jpg] Stephen Hickman has been illustrating science fiction and fantasy since 1977.His painting, sculpture, and writing has earned him a World Science FictionConvention’s Hugo Award and six Chesley Awards.

"},{"pageContent":"Introduction We have been building spaceships and space stations, pointing our telescopestoward the heavens, and hoping that someday, in a not-too-distant future, we’llget lucky and discover alien civilizations out there. The Search forExtra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI) program has been listening to the sky formore than forty years—a significant time period during which Earth’s populationhas doubled—and the heavens appear to be hopelessly silent. . . . Perhaps wehave been looking in the wrong places or in the wrong direction or usinginappropriate methods. Perhaps, instead of searching for aliens in the sky, weshould look much closer—inside ourselves, in those places from which we havebeen receiving messages of alien intelligence for millennia, though few of ushave ever paid attention. Our universe is beautiful, complex, and full of delightful surprises. The mostastounding secrets are often hidden in plain sight. What if the supermarkettabloids (“the best investigative journalism on the planet,” according to TommyLee Jones’s character in the film Men in Black) are right on target and aliensindeed live right next to us? There is an old story that after Creation, God was wondering where to hide theultimate secrets of the universe. The Almighty contemplated: Should I hide themdeep in the oceans? No; humans can invent submarines and these secrets can fallinto unworthy hands. Should I hide them in the remote corners of the universe?Not good either; humans can develop spaceships and the secrets can get intowrong hands. Then an idea occurred to God: The secrets of the universe can behidden at the bottom of humans’ minds, deep in their souls. Then, only theworthy can find them. If you are already capable of listening to the inner voice or are on the wayinward toward that goal, then surely you will become worthy to discover thesecrets of the universe. This book not only aims to show you the inner paths tothe outer space, but it also attempts to explain to the rationally minded whyand how these paths work. Astronomers are still trying to locate and identify dark matter and dark energy.More than 80 percent of the mass in the universe is unaccounted for and iseffectively invisible to our most sophisticated instruments. New theories positthat dark matter and energy are hidden in the six, ten, or more additionalspatial dimensions predicted by string theory, though some physicists argue thatdark matter is simply difficult-to-observe particles in our universe. Physicistssuch as Michio Kaku tell us that parallel universes may be hiding in the higherdimensions, and experiments are in progress to prove their existence. Is itpossible to access parallel universes by any means? Is it possible to perceiveextra dimensions? Physical laws as we know them are restrictive in this regard. Electromagneticwaves—as far as we know—cannot carry information between dimensions. Somespeculate that gravitons can travel between multiple universes, but coherentlight cannot reach us from these places; we can only feel the gravitationalforce of our neighboring universes. In Psychedelic Shamanism Jim DeKornepostulates: “[F]or human beings, spatial dimensions of three and less areexternal, and dimensions higher than three are internal. Hence, for us, allspatial dimensions higher than three are mental or psychic. It follows from thisthat a four-dimensional being would be experienced subjectively by athree-dimensional being as an inner voice or hallucination, as an interiorphenomenon.”1 [index_split_017.html#filepos815101] Some claim that people have been venturing into alien worlds for thousands ofyears. Most of these people have not necessarily been NASA astronauts,scientists working for SETI project, or even science-fiction fans. Many of theseexplorers have not been prepared for what they have experienced, and most ofthem have never heard about First Contact manuals. Instead, they have beenspiritual seekers, shamans, religious ascetics, medical research subjects,psychiatric patients, drug abusers, and common people who, accidentally andsometimes against their will, have been forced to become our planetaryambassadors to alien worlds. One notable exception: science-fiction writers who have traveled through thesegateways in search of inspiration. There is more science-fiction literature,art, and film that may have been inspired by mind-expanding experiences thanmost of us suspect, from Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland to Philip K. Dick’sbrilliant novels such as Valis, Ubik, and The Divine Invasion. Movies such asTotal Recall, Dark City, The Matrix, Renegade, eXistenZ, Vanilla Sky, TheFountain, The Waking Life, The Truman Show, The X-Files, The Lord of the Rings,and even Star Wars may owe their inspiration to these same sources, the alteredstates of consciousness experienced by their authors. Why is it that most science-fiction fans, the very people who are probably bestprepared for contact with aliens, are not the ones who have visited alien worldsand traveled in time to call on the lost cities of Atlantis? Most of our fellowhumans still don’t have the faintest idea that the universe is teeming withlife. It may be surprising to many that the secret gateways to alien worlds maybe hidden inside our own minds and that humans already have been traveling inspace and time and making contact with alien species. Where do shamans actually travel when they go to the underworld or fly to theupperworld looking for spirits, arguing, bargaining, negotiating, or evenfighting with those they find? Who are these entities who give shamanic healersadvice and powers to use upon returning to their tribe? What is the source ofthat otherworldly information, that immense energy these shamans tap in to intheir travels? Does it originate in the shaman’s mind or does it come fromexternal powers that reside in some invisible realm? Another important, fundamental question: Can information bypass the five sensesto enter the brain? The power of intuition and mind-expanding experiences mayexplain why almost every important idea introduced by science-fiction writershas entered mainstream science eventually. Academic articles on hyperspace, timetravel, supraluminal speed, teleportation, and parallel universes once belongedsolely to the realm of science fiction, but are published nowadays in journalsof theoretical physics. Some of these ideas have even reached an experimentalstage. This may be shocking to skeptics, even though skeptics are ratherdifficult to surprise. Most of us have heard about the ideas of Erich von Däniken and Zecharia Sitchin.Perhaps these authors have a point: Humankind has had visitors—but they may havecome to visit us through inner space, rather than outer space. It is possible,however, that the people whom we consider instrumental in the sudden growth ofcivilization experienced some sort of naturally occurring psychedelic visions asa source of their inspiration and ingenious inventions. Perhaps the culture weare so proud of was shaped many thousand of years ago by the influence of anendogenous hallucinogen. Perhaps mystical traditions are correct in teachingthat there is an infinite world inside of us and that this infinite world mergeswith or is established upon the same fundamental principles as the worldoutside. Surprisingly, contemporary physics has a great deal to say about all ofthese suppositions. The idea for this book came from research conducted on human volunteers who wereadministered intravenous DMT, or dimethyltryptamine. DMT, a compound found inthe human brain, produces extraordinary changes in consciousness: dreams,religious exaltation, psychosis, and near-death experiences. Substances such asDMT are known as psychedelics or hallucinogens. They appear to work as keys tolocks inside the mind, allowing entry into different realities. Each key(hallucinogen) opens a different door, but all of these doors lead to realmsthat differ from our consensus reality. DMT and related compounds are present in numerous species of plants growing intemperate and tropical regions. DMT has been used by shamans in South Americaand the Caribbean for millennia as a main component of snuff and in a decoctioncalled ayahuasca—a plant extract that combines DMT, which is inactive when takenorally, with the beta-carbolines that potently inhibit the enzyme responsiblefor very rapid degradation of DMT in our gut and liver, which therefore allowsDMT to reach and exercise its effects on the central nervous system. Shamanic use of sacred plants such as peyote, mushrooms, and ayahuasca serves tofree the soul from corporeal confinement, facilitate access to realms ofalternate reality, and allow communication with the spiritual world. Theseplants are also used to diagnose and treat a wide variety of illnesses, bothpsychological and physical. Ingestion of traditional sacred plants in connectionwith shamanic rituals often results in spiritual experiences. We can argue thatsome of these experiences qualify as travel into realms belonging to certaingenres of science fiction such as horror, fantasy, and ghost stories.Participants in these rituals frequently report encounters with spiritualbeings—some of them benevolent, some of them scary and threatening. Othersexperience time travel, telepathy, or merging with God. DMT often induces experiences that belong to hard science fiction or spaceopera. Almost 50 percent of the subjects participating in a clinical studyconducted by Rick Strassman claimed to remain totally lucid while visitingabsolutely alien realms. Some of them described seeing vast, orbital structuresaround unknown planets or meeting and interacting with peculiar alien beings.These contacts ranged from various attempts at communication to bizarre surgicalprocedures and even intercourse with aliens! Many of these reports parallelthose of “alien abduction” literature, leading us to speculate about arelationship between endogenous DMT and such encounters. It is interesting to note that subjects who have been hypnotized for a varietyof purposes have reported similar experiences. These experiences may also beexplained by the effects of endogenous DMT. But are such experiences real? Canhallucinations be true? Did these people actually meet aliens and visit distantplanets? Read on and judge for yourself. "},{"pageContent":"image [images/00004.jpg] 1image [images/00004.jpg] The Psychedelics Overview of a Controversial Drug Type Rick Strassman, M.D. Consciousness is a mystery, and the association of consciousness with matter iseven more mysterious. How does a particular collection of molecules and energycombine to create awareness? Further, what determines the quality and content ofconsciousness? These are some of the general questions facing us as consciousbeings. In the context of this book, we address particular questions regardingunusual states of consciousness in which we perceive things that are notnormally perceivable. Consciousness contains an unlimited number of states, several of which humansaccess in their lives. Wakefulness, deep sleep, meditation, and psychosis aresome of these general categories. We may enter these states via built-inbiological rhythms, such as the sleep–wake cycle. Perturbations of normalphysiology—for example, fever, illness, sleep deprivation, starvation, andfasting—also produce different states of consciousness. In addition, a varietyof natural substances contained in plants as well as certain synthetic drugsaffect consciousness.1 [index_split_017.html#filepos815525] Many nonhuman animals consume plants or plant products for theirconsciousness-altering effects. Examples include fermented fruit swillingelephants, dazed and confused bees that return repeatedly to wallow in theflowers of psychoactive datura plants, and catnipintoxicated felines. Someauthors suggest that animals possess an innate drive for intoxication.2[index_split_017.html#filepos815742] We can assume that in the mists ofprehistory, early hominids, imitating the animals with which they shared theirecosystem, also partook of plants to enter altered states. In some of Andrew Weil’s early work, he suggests a specifically human drive toexperience altered states of consciousness.3[index_split_017.html#filepos815997] Some of the methods employed are modifyingour biology through environmental or behavioral means, such as sweat lodges,spinning in circles, and prolonged chanting. Another way to experience alteredconsciousness is by ingesting psychoactive plants. Throughout the world and at all times, humans have consumed a dizzying array ofplants and plant products for their mind-altering effects. We have been drinkingwine; chewing coca leaves; smoking opium; drinking coffee; and chewing, smoking,or snuffing tobacco. Chemical compounds in certain plants are the most proximatecauses of these effects: In wine, this compound is ethanol; in coca leaves, itis cocaine; in opium, morphine; in coffee, caffeine; in tobacco, it isnicotine.*1 [index_split_016.html#filepos809677] image [images/00005.jpg] According to nature-based religious traditions, plants possess intelligence.Many modern Westerners who have undergone a deep experience with ayahuasca (apsychedelic botanical brew from the Amazon) can vouch for the apparent presenceof a “personality” in this botanical brew with which they communicate under theinfluence. While such phenomena strain the credulity of disciples of materialist science,they nevertheless point toward realms of consciousness containing nonhumanintelligence that we may find useful in our struggle to continue existing onEarth. As thinking creatures, we construct categories for things we encounter. In thismanner, we can note different categories of drug effects. How can we bestclassify mind-altering drugs? Many years ago, I attended a lecture by Dr.Alexander Shulgin on the chemistry of psychedelic drugs. Dr. Shulgin is a SanFrancisco Bay Area medicinal chemist and the creator of hundreds of novelpsychoactive compounds.4 [index_split_017.html#filepos816262] He is a dynamicspeaker—a fount of information, opinions, and firsthand experience. Doing hisbest to put the nonchemist members of his audience at ease, he began the lectureby sharing with us a simple model in which all psychoactive drugs belong toeither the image [images/00006.jpg]s, the image [images/00007.jpg]s, or theimage [images/00008.jpg]s. We usually call drugs in theimage [images/00007.jpg] family stimulants, or“uppers,” hence the arrow-up symbol. The member of this category with which weare most familiar is caffeine, found in coffee, tea, and soft drinks. Othermembers of this family are nicotine in tobacco; cocaine in the coca plant;synthetic amphetamine and methamphetamine; the cathinone containing khat plantof the Middle East and northern Africa; Ritalin (methylphenidate), the commonlyprescribed medication for attention deficit disorders; and arecoline-containingbetel nuts, chewed in Asian and Pacific regions. The effects of image [images/00006.jpg]s are relatively easy to describe: Inmost of us, most of the time, typical doses of these drugs used in a controlledmanner elicit a magnification or amplification of various psychobiologicalfunctions, including attention, thinking rate and accuracy, wakefulness, levelof anxiety, and motor activity. Taking too much of a image [images/00006.jpg],however, pushes us beyond our limits, and leads to effects such as seizures fromnervous system toxicity and potentially lethal arrhythmias from cardiactoxicity. We call image [images/00007.jpg] agents sedatives, or “downers.” We refer tothem as hypnotic drugs when their primary purpose is to induce sleep, anxiolyticdrugs when we need to reduce overall arousal but maintain wakefulness, andanesthetic drugs in cases that require an unresponsive, inert state. Alcohol,benzodiazepines such as Xanax and Valium, opiate narcotics, kava found inPolynesia and Hawaii, and general anesthetics belong to this category. Their effects, relatively easy to describe, are essentially opposite those ofimage [images/00006.jpg]s. With their use, attention drifts, thinking slows, andsleep approaches; we are calmer and less anxious and we move more slowly andclumsily. At toxic doses, coma and respiratory and cardiovascular collapse mayoccur. The effects of the image [images/00008.jpg] group, the focus of this book andthose that may provide an inner path to outer space, are more difficult tocharacterize—but not because their effects are more subtle, for they areanything but subtle at effective doses. Instead, these substances seem to modifythe quality of consciousness, rather than produce the general enhancement orreduction of mental process that we observe with image [images/00006.jpg]s andimage [images/00007.jpg]s, respectively. The image [images/00008.jpg] substancesaffect those aspects of consciousness that we identify most closely with oursense of being human—that is, particular ways of thinking, feeling, perceiving,and willing. We usually call the effects of the image [images/00008.jpg]s psychedelic orhallucinogenic. These drugs occupy a unique position in the superfamily ofmind-altering chemicals. The highly charged nature of discussions of these drugsrelates to the extraordinary nature of these psychological effects.5[index_split_017.html#filepos816474] The difficulty in describing accurately or consistently the effects ofpsychedelic drugs has led to a bewildering profusion of names for them:hallucinogen or illusogen (producing hallucinations or illusions, respectively),psychedelic (mind-manifesting), entheogen (generating the divine within),mysticomimetic (mimicking the mystical state), oneirogen (generating dreams),phanerothyme (making feelings visible), phantasticant (eliciting fantasy),psychodysleptic (distorting or disrupting the mind), psychotomimetic (mimickingpsychosis), psychotogen (generating psychosis), psychotoxin (toxic to the mind),schizotoxin (toxic in a way that causes schizophrenia), and deliriant (causingdelirium). Each name captures a certain element of the intoxication and themanner in which we interpret those effects—what they mean, and how the drugsproduce them.6 [index_split_017.html#filepos816680] Hallucinogen is the preferred medical-legal term for these substances. Althoughhallucinations do occur in psychedelic drug intoxication, they are notinvariant. Neither do all of us agree, particularly across cultures, regardingthe “unreal” nature of the perceived visions and voices that the termhallucination suggests. This perhaps unintended implication of the termhallucinogen probably reflects more or less conscious materialistic skepticismregarding nonvisible realities. Note I use the term materialistic rather thanscientific, because we may indeed apply the tools and models of science just aseasily to nonmaterial data as we do to material data. While the term psychedelic evokes memories of and reactions to a particularpolitical and sociocultural phenomenon harkening back to the turbulent 1960s, Iprefer it over the other terms currently in use. This philologically incorrectamalgam of Greek and Latin roots refers to the most basic property of thesedrugs—that is, they are mind-manifesting. They show us our mind—its contents andits processes— from a very different perspective. Beyond that level ofabstraction, however, I believe all the other terms become either toovalue-laden or restrictively particular in their labeling of what we experienceunder the influence of these drugs. EARLY HUMAN HISTORY OF PSYCHEDELIC USE There are anthropological and art historical data suggesting humans have usedpsychedelic plants for thousands or perhaps tens of thousands of years. TerenceMcKenna, a psychedelic philosopher, gazing back at man’s preverbal Africanancestors, speculates that protohominids used psychedelic mushrooms for theirunique visual effects to aid hunting. An unexpected side effect of this use wasthe stimulation of language development, perhaps through the unique property ofpsychedelics to blend and merge the senses of sight and sound. Our ancestors mayhave seen the sounds they were making, which provided them with an unprecedentedadditional level of abstraction with which they could manipulate communication.7[index_split_017.html#filepos816903] We can add to this the speculations of Gordon Wasson, a New York banker andamateur mycologist. In the 1950s, Wasson discovered and reported on psilocybinmushroom ceremonies in Mexico that most anthropologists believed had beenextinct for hundreds of years. After experiencing firsthand the ineffability,ecstasy, and visions induced by the mushroom intoxication, he proposed thatpsychedelic plants were responsible for the first glimmerings of religioussensibilities in man: such experiences were evidence that invisible,freestanding, portentous realities exist beyond the veil of everyday life.8[index_split_017.html#filepos817087] Thus, we have theories suggesting that plant-based psychedelics are responsiblefor two of humanity’s most unique creations: language and religion. Why, then,is it so difficult to come by information about psychedelics? Pendulums swing;perhaps the shift from a primarily matriarchal worldview to a more patriarchalone caused the banishment of psychedelic plants from mainstream religious andsocial use. A more matriarchal, nature-and earth-based civilization with apanoply of divinely imbued entities probably perceived little conflict betweenusing plant-based psychedelics to commune with spiritual realities and aphilosophy that emphasized humans’ inseparability from nature. Patriarchalreligions, in both the East and the West, on the other hand, developed a moredichotomous view of humans relative to the rest of nature, and more often thannot assumed a frankly antagonistic attitude toward the spiritual significance ofall things material.9 [index_split_017.html#filepos817388] This was not theoriginal teaching of those who founded these religions, yet the priestly classeseventually established hegemony over doctrine and practice. These clericsadopted a worldview that extracted from nature any spiritual relevance, andsucceeded eventually in driving psychedelic plant use underground. Those inpositions of religious authority considered psychedelic, plant-inducedexperiences ill-informed or degenerate at best; at worst, they condemned the useof these plants as an evil that required extermination.*2[index_split_016.html#filepos810121] The only significant human institution that, from its earliest origins, hasregarded plant-based psychedelics as a fundamental component of religious andspiritual activity is shamanism. Later in this book we will discuss therelevance of a shamanic approach to the use of psychedelic plants and drugs. RECENT HISTORY OF PSYCHEDELICS IN THE WEST Within traditional Western academic settings, anthropology is the field that hasfocused attention on psychedelic plant use and the role of these plants in thesocieties that use them. More than any other field, it has maintained the flameof interest in these plants and drugs over several hundred years of Westernsuppression of all information about them.10[index_split_017.html#filepos817607] Within the last sixty to seventy years,however, it has been within the medical-scientific framework, primarilypsychiatry, psychology, and the neurosciences, that our culture has viewed andunderstood psychedelic drugs. In the 1890s, the German chemist Arthur Heffter isolated mescaline from thepeyote cactus and, in a series of self-experiments, determined itspsychoactivity. Over the next twenty to thirty years, this drug attracted somescientific attention;11 [index_split_017.html#filepos817852]however, mescaline’spronounced side effects of nausea and vomiting, as well as the lack of a cogentpsychological and biological context within which to understand its effects,limited its study. From the viewpoint of biology, very little data existed regarding how drugsaffected the brain. From the viewpoint of psychology, Freudian systems, dominantat the time, took a dim view of what were viewed as religious or spiritualstates, considering them infantile or regressed. The exception to the Freudianschool’s disdain of altered states of consciousness was the use of freeassociation, a variant of hypnosis, in psychoanalytic practice. The Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung, at one time Freud’s closest disciple, took abroader view of religious and spiritual experience in human psychologicaldevelopment, yet it appears that discussions of plant-based or syntheticpsychedelics are absent from his writings. This is surprising inasmuch as thesynthesis and first use of LSD occurred in Switzerland more than a decade beforeJung’s death. In the mid-1940s, all this changed when the Swiss chemist Albert Hofmannsynthesized LSD and soon thereafter described its profound psychologicaleffects.12 [index_split_017.html#filepos818129] LSD’s properties and the biological and psychological contexts in which itsdiscovery took place were much more propitious than those of mescaline.Psychology was beginning to question the all-encompassing power ofpsychoanalysis to explain and treat every psychological condition. In addition,the rest of medicine was going through a period of great expansion via thediscoveries of many basic pathobiological processes: for example, the efficacyof antibiotics in treating infections. Psychiatry began looking at biology as away to join once again the larger field of medicine, healing the breach that anoverreliance upon Freudian psychoanalysis had created. LSD did not have many invariant physiological effects, particularly theunpleasant gastrointestinal ones of mescaline. Even more striking was itspotency, which is thousands of times greater than mescaline. LSD is active indoses of millionths of grams, rather than mescaline’s thousandths of grams. Inaddition to LSD’s more benign side-effect profile and startling potency,developments in the nascent field of psychopharmacology provided a strongimpetus for LSD’s research use. In 1948, scientists discovered that serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5-HT) isinvolved in the mechanism by which blood vessels constrict in response toinjury. Soon thereafter, researchers discovered 5-HT in the brain. Studies thendemonstrated its behavioral effects in laboratory animals. As a result of theselatter two findings, 5-HT was labeled as the first known neurotransmitter, anaturally occurring chemical modifying brain function through its effects onnerve cells. Eventually, research revealed that LSD produces its effects bymodifying serotonin function in the brain,13[index_split_017.html#filepos818324] a theory that has only become more refinedand sophisticated over the last sixty years. The use of chlorpromazine (Thorazine) in the early 1950s as the first specificantipsychotic medication provided another cause for excitement in the youngfield of “biological psychiatry.” For the first time, a medication couldselectively block the delusions and hallucinations of psychotic patients withoutputting them to sleep, which occurred regularly with the use of barbiturates,the only previously available drugs for these conditions. These three agents—serotonin, LSD, and Thorazine—affecting the mind through theaegis of knowable biological processes ushered in a new era of scientificinquiry, that of psychopharmacology—the study of how drugs affect the psyche.Serotonin is a naturally occurring, behaviorally active neurotransmitter; LSD isa drug affecting serotonin and producing what appeared to be a bona fidepsychosis; and Thorazine blocks psychotic symptoms in patients with endogenouspsychoses such as schizophrenia. These three were the original scientific legsof the tripod supporting the birth of this new field. It is striking that our society has forgotten how critical LSD was in the earlystages of the development of psychopharmacology, and that it continues to be aseminal contributor to the field today. It is reminiscent of the patriarchy“forgetting” the role of psychedelic plants in spiritual and religious settings.During the late 1940s through the late 1960s, hundreds of scientific papers anddozens of books, monographs, and scientific meetings discussed the latest inpsychedelic drug research. Many of the key figures of academic psychiatry andpharmacology began their career in this field. Presidents of the AmericanPsychiatric Association, chairmen of psychiatry departments, advisers to andmembers of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)—all cut their teeth inthe psychedelic research field. It was an exciting, well-funded, and creativetime. There were several approaches to the study and application of psychedelicswithin psychiatry. One group focused on the brain–mind relationships that thesedrugs could illuminate (structure–activity studies)—that is, how does thestructure of an individual drug affect its pharmacology? What is therelationship between the pharmacology of a particular compound and its effectson the brain, and how do those effects relate to behavioral and subjectiveeffects? Scientists used several more-or-less proximate outcome measures to assess howthese drugs affect the brain. The most proximate included variables such as thelocalization and characterization of changes LSD produced in the living brain.For example, scientists might attach a radioactive atom to LSD and then injectit into an animal. Using radiation-measuring photography, they could thendetermine where in the brain this LSD ended up by locating the “lighted” sites.Researchers also determined effects of a psychedelic drug on electrical activitywithin individual nerve cells. Farther downstream, reflecting a closer link between pharmacology and organismalbiology, were physiological reactions to these drugs, such as fluctuations intemperature, blood pressure, and blood hormone levels. By knowing whichneurotransmitter systems mediated these biological effects and then comparing apsychedelic’s effects on these parameters, scientists could deduce which brainsystems psychedelics modified. The least proximate but most relevant outcome measures were behavioral effectsin animals and psychological effects in humans. For example, a drug somewhatlike LSD in structure might produce in laboratory animals behavioral effectsthat were more or less like those produced by LSD. And, in humans, for example,this “LSD-like” drug might produce more emotional but fewer visual effects thanthose produced by LSD. Once researchers knew the basic receptor orelectrophysiological pharmacology of this new drug, they could hypothesizeregarding the link between pharmacology and animal behavior and/or humansubjective response. It is important to keep in mind, however, that no matterhow sophisticated our behavioral models in nonhuman animals are, nothingreplaces human data in establishing subjective effects. Other researchers believed psychedelic drugs were useful tools for studyingpsychosis. By producing a “model” psychosis in normal volunteers and assessingit carefully, they hoped to understand the nature of the endogenous illnessesthat these drug intoxications resembled. In addition, if scientists could findpharmacological antidotes to a model psychosis, they could apply thesetreatments to endogenous psychotic illnesses: a drug that blocked the LSD effectin humans might prove beneficial in treating schizophrenia, if indeedLSD-induced states and schizophrenia had the same features. A logical outgrowth of the model-psychosis approach focused on searching for anendogenous psychedelic chemical. If scientists could identify an LSD-likecompound in the human body, they could then characterize its properties anddevelop ways to block the production of, or responses to, this schizotoxin. As aresult, we would have a formidable tool in treating naturally occurringpsychosis. Indeed, in the 1960s several reports described the existence in the human bodyof the powerful, short-acting tryptamine psychedelics DMT and 5-methoxy-DMT.These compounds attained great prominence at that time. Later, we will addressthe history of endogenous tryptamine research in more detail. A variant of the model-psychosis approach was that of self-experimentation withthese drugs by researchers and other psychiatrists. They believed it waspossible to obtain a firsthand experience of psychosis and thereby enhance theirempathy in dealing with patients afflicted with this disorder. Researchers also noticed that human volunteers reported profound changes inemotional and psychological processes akin to those occurring in the course ofpsychotherapy as a result of the use of psychedelic drugs. For example, these“psychedelic psychotherapy” researchers hoped to apply the increasedsuggestibility of psychedelic drug intoxication in order to strengthen thetherapeutic alliance between patient and therapist. They believed that it mightbe possible to use the enhanced visual symbolization of thoughts and feelings todelve deeper into presumed unconscious conflicts. Novel and more-creativeassociations among thoughts, memories, and feelings might also provide theability to perform deeper psychological work than any that could occur withdrug-free psychotherapy, and could therefore allow for better resolution ofconflicts. The reports describing enhanced creativity under the influence of psychedelicsare related to the psychotherapeutic model. Much of what occurs in effectivepsychotherapy is essentially creative in nature and involves attaining andapplying new, more conscious ways of relating to mental structures andprocesses. Psychedelic drug-induced modifying of mental processes in “theservice of the ego” in healthy, creative individuals might be useful indeveloping new approaches to problem solving. There were a great many psychotherapy studies during the boom years ofpsychedelic research, enrolling hundreds of patients with a wide variety ofdisorders. These projects generated encouraging data that suggested efficacy intreating otherwise intractable conditions: neurotic, psychotic, and personalitydisorders, as well as substance abuse and dependence. Early studies often werepositive, but also were difficult to generalize from research site to site. Theabrupt discontinuation of research in the early 1970s precluded the fine-tuningof procedures and patient selection that naturally evolve to optimize any newtreatment method. The similarities between psychedelic drug effects and less pathological, highlyaltered states of consciousness, such as mystical and near-death experiences,were the focus of inquiry for a small but vocal group of researchers. Theybelieved that the more reliable, consistently attainable psychedelic drug statecould shed light on some of these naturally occurring psychedelic states. Theyhoped to understand better the nature of these states and to exploit theirpotential beneficial properties free of the accompanying religious disciplineand dogmatic overlay of any particular tradition. These researchers wereresponsible for establishing transpersonal psychology, a field that continues tothrive. Military and domestic intelligence agencies also carried out a covert researchagenda during those years. The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and themilitary funded and performed these projects, due partly to similar efforts thattook place in countries whose aims we considered hostile to ours (e.g., Chinaand the Soviet Union). Investigators attempted to use psychedelics asbrainwashing or truth-serum agents. The lack of reliability of these drugs toproduce these effects led to the cessation of these pernicious projects. Thoughinformed consent in aboveboard research at the time left something to bedesired, these covert operations were surreptitious to the extreme.14[index_split_017.html#filepos818585] A generation of human psychedelic research came to an end almost as quickly asit began after the enactment of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) in theUnited States in 1970. Similar legislation followed throughout the world,primarily through U.S.-driven United Nations enactments. The CSA effectivelyshut off academic research by placing these drugs behind a nearly impenetrablewall of bureaucracy and permits. This law passed because of fears in theacademic, law enforcement, and public health communities that these drugs weretoo dangerous for anyone to use in any setting. In addition, legislatorsbelieved academic researchers were incapable of preventing unacceptablediversion of drug supplies to the street. Timothy Leary’s behavior andpronouncements while he performed bona fide psilocybin research at HarvardUniversity did much to fuel these anxieties. It is also likely that the political upheavals in the United States over theVietnam War and the media’s promulgating the perception that these drugs led toa libertine and anarchist lifestyle contributed to enacting what now appears tobe hastily conceived legislation. Human research with psychedelics thus ceasedfor twenty years, but basic research using nonhuman species continued apace. Thenext two decades saw great advances in a fundamental understanding of howpsychedelics affect the brain. In addition, though government-licensed and government-funded psychotherapystudies ended at this time, psychotherapeutic use of psychedelics continued,albeit underground. Participants used a number of different approaches tooptimize drug effects on the therapeutic process: Jungian, Freudian, gestalt,and neoshamanic orientations. These activities were poorly documented anddifficult to discuss in any manner of public discourse, but were enormouslywidespread. In addition, field or street use of psychedelic drugs never dropped offseriously, even with the newly restricted status of these substances. Individualuse of these drugs for pleasure, psychological insights, and spiritual practiceremained and continues to be popular. So has their use in groups to enhancesocial bonding at rock concerts, raves, and similar gatherings. It should be clear that we are dealing with an extraordinarily complex family ofdrugs—or, more accurately, with an extraordinarily complex experience into whichthese drugs seem to allow entry. We must look more closely at the variouspsychedelics and their effects, how they produce these effects, what theseeffects may say about human consciousness, and how we can best utilize thesedrugs for the greater good and with the least harm. CHEMISTRY Let us begin with the basic objective molecules—that is, the chemistry of thesedrugs. For our purposes, we are concerned with the “classical” psychedelics—LSD,psilocybin, DMT, and mescaline. The two chemical groups into which we classifythese drugs are the tryptamines and the phenethylamines. Tryptamine psychedelics possess a tryptamine core—a hexagonal six-carbon ringjoined to a four-carbon plus one-nitrogen pentagonal ring. A two-carbon chainwith a nitrogen atom at the end then attaches to the pentagonal ring. The bodyeasily synthesizes the tryptamine building block from tryptophan, an amino acidcontained in all of our diets. The prototypical tryptamine psychedelic is N,N-dimethyltryptamine, or DMT, inwhich two carbons attach to the nitrogen at the end of tryptamine. A largenumber of plants contain DMT, as does every mammalian species whose tissuesresearchers have analyzed. It has been detected in human blood, urine, spinalfluid, and brain and lung tissue. Scientists have identified and cloned thehuman gene that makes the enzymes catalyzing the final step in DMT synthesis.Further, DMT is the visionary component of the psychedelic Amazon brew known asayahuasca. The federal judiciaries of the United States and other countries haveupheld the legality of the use of DMT in ayahuasca by specific churches, such asO Centro Espirita Beneficiente União do Vegetal. A closely related tryptamine is 5-methoxy-DMT (or 5-MeO-DMT). Many of the sameplants and animals that contain DMT also contain this compound. A better-knowntryptamine is psilocybin, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms. Thestructure of psilocybin is essentially the same as that of a DMT molecule with aphosphate group—a phosphorus atom plus four oxygen atoms—attached to thesix-carbon ring of the DMT. More “complex” tryptamine derivatives include the signature psychedelic drugLSD, or lysergic acid diethylamide-25, also known simply as acid. Its“lysergamide” backbone contains the basic tryptamine building block. Anothercomplex tryptamine is the African psychedelic ibogaine, found in the plantTabernanthe iboga, which reputedly possesses profound antiaddictive properties. The other major chemical family of classical psychedelics is thephenethylamines. These contain a phenethylamine core—a six-carbon hexagonal ringwith a side chain of two carbons and nitrogen. Though amphetamine andmethamphetamine, two powerful image [images/00006.jpg]s, are phenethylamines, weare more interested here in those with typical psychedelic effects, the bestknown of which is mescaline. Mescaline is the primary active ingredient in the peyote cactus, Lophophorawilliamsii, found in the U.S. Southwest and in northern Mexico. The NativeAmerican Church, extant among North American indigenous populations, uses peyotein its ceremonies. U.S. and Canadian law protects this use. Alexander Shulgin has created a vast array of phenethylamine analogs, chemicalcousins of mescaline, with varying degrees of pharmacological and psychologicalsimilarities to mescaline and amphetamine.15[index_split_017.html#filepos818853] There are other drugs, both synthetic and found in plants, with psychedelicproperties, yet we do not usually consider them classical psychedelics. Thesecompounds, however, possess psychological and pharmacological properties more orless like those of the classical drugs. Some examples are salvinorin A, found inSalvia divinorum (diviner’s sage); 3,4-methylene-dioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA,also known as Ecstasy); ketamine; phencyclidine (PCP, also known as angel dust);dextromethorphan (DXM); and perhaps high-dose marijuana. PHARMACOLOGY We understand relatively well the pharmacology of the classical hallucinogens.Researchers continue to fine-tune hypotheses regarding mechanisms of action ofthese substances, but have established the basic outline in some detail. Mostdrugs act in the body by attaching to receptors on target cells. Thesereceptors, composed of protein and fat, are produced by nature to receivechemical information from both within and without. Hormones attach to specificreceptors located on different cell types in the body: for example, insulinattaches to receptors on fat cells to modify metabolism, and thyroid hormoneattaches to receptors on heart cells. In the brain, receptors exist for the large number of neurotransmitterssynthesized either in the brain itself or in other tissues (particularly thegut). These chemicals provide a vector for information transfer andcommunication between and among the cells in the brain. A tiny space called thesynapse separates adjacent nerve cells. Neurons propagate information withintheir own cell bodies via electric currents. When this current reaches the endof the neuron, it releases into the synapse packets of neurotransmitters, whichit previously synthesized. These neurotransmitters attach to receptors onadjacent cells. Examples of neurotransmitters are serotonin (5-HT),acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, gamma amino butyric acid (GABA), andglutamate.16 [index_split_017.html#filepos819086] Though serotonin exists throughout the body, particularly in the gut and blood,for the most part it is not abundant in the brain, except perhaps in the pinealgland, a quasi–nervous system organ. Nevertheless, 5-HT has diverse effects onmultiple brain functions, which include control of physiological systems such ascardiovascular and endocrine systems as well as temperature regulation. It alsoaffects areas of the brain that mediate emotional, cognitive, and sensoryfunctions. Scientists quickly determined that LSD and other classical psychedelics modify5-HT systems by interacting with 5-HT receptors, usually activating the cellspossessing those receptors.17 [index_split_017.html#filepos819337] Occasionally,however, depending upon the biochemical milieu of the relevant neurons, LSDcould elicit antiserotonin effects. In the last several decades, the model of classical psychedelics interactingwith 5-HT receptors as the means by which they produce their effects remainsundisputed. Further refinements have detailed the importance of particular typesof 5-HT receptors, their location, and the nature of the cascading effects begunby the initial interaction of the drugs with those receptors.18[index_split_017.html#filepos819625] Classical psychedelics affect serotoninsystems in brain areas that we know relate to the particular mental functionsmodified by these drugs: for example, the frontal lobes, in terms of the effectsof these psychedelics on thinking; the limbic system, in terms of their effectson emotional states; and visual and auditory cortices, in terms of their visualand auditory effects. Other neurotransmitter systems are more relevant to the effects of the atypicalpsychedelics. For example, MDMA causes neurons to release serotonin anddopamine, rather than attaching directly to serotonin receptors on downstreamcells. Salvinorin A affects a particular type of opiate receptor that normallymediates effects of opiate painkillers and naturally occurring opioids—theendorphins. Dextromethorphan, phencyclidine, and ketamine modify glutamate andopiate systems in a complex, interactive manner. While we understand a great deal about the pharmacology of these drugs, it isimportant to remember the existence of the “explanatory gap” inpsychopharmacology—that is, our inability to relate directly, in any particularcase, the relationship between subjective experience and changes in brainchemistry. People under the influence of LSD do not feel it modifying theirserotonin receptor function; instead, they feel bliss or terror, and they seeand hear things that other people do not. This explanatory gap operates even incases of drugs with less-dramatic effects, such as antidepressants, antianxietyagents, and stimulants. People on fluoxetine (Prozac), for example, feel lessdepressed; they do not feel their serotonin levels rise or their receptorsdecrease in number. In the case of the relationship between the brain and consciousness, we may beable to pinpoint the location and nature of the relevant physiological changes,but how they play out in the mind of any particular individual at any particularmoment remains an absolute mystery. TIME COURSE In addition to the chemical and pharmacological properties of psychedelics, italso is possible to characterize their time courses—how quickly effects ensueand how long those effects last. Intravenous and smoked DMT effects begin withinseconds and conclude in about thirty minutes. In the case of ibogaine, an houror more may pass between oral ingestion and the onset of effects, and itseffects last for at least twelve to fourteen hours. Oral LSD and mescaline beginexerting their effects within thirty to forty minutes of ingestion, and theselast eight to twelve hours. Oral psilocybin and ayahuasca effects begin withintwenty to thirty minutes of ingestion and are barely perceptible after six toeight hours. SUBJECTIVE EFFECTS It is probably as difficult to describe the effects of psychedelic drugs onconsciousness as it is to describe consciousness itself. These drugs affect allcomponents of consciousness: self-awareness, sensation, thinking, volition,emotion, perception, and relatedness. One of the challenges wrought by thepsychedelics is just this concatenation of consciousness-altering properties.Because so many functions change under their influence, they force us to examinemore closely the very nature of consciousness—its basic properties and normaloperation. Sensory effects often predominate in psychedelic drug intoxication and areresponsible for the common term hallucinogen. Visual changes are striking andmay include the presence of a visible, buzzing, vibrating field around physicalobjects and a melting of the boundaries of those objects. There may bemagnification, diminution, or alteration of color intensity and hue. Sometimescolors generate auditory impressions, a blending of sense information calledsynesthesia. Those who take psychedelics may see things others do not, eitherwith eyes closed or open. In addition, what they see with eyes closed may besuperimposed upon the outside world when they open their eyes. They may see relatively simple geometric swirls in space or on an object, ormore detailed images. Some of these visions are extraordinarily complex and mayconsist of quite well-formed and recognizable objects—for example, livingcreatures, machinery, and landscapes. Those experiencing psychedelics’ effectsmay even perceive a white light that mystics claim to be divine or spiritualrevelation. Sounds become either mellower or painfully harsh. In another form of synethesia,individuals may see sounds. Previously unheard rhythms—pulsating, rushing, ormechanical—may manifest, or one or several voices may be heard. In someinstances, individuals might not hear anything at all; they might be in a stateof functional deafness. Effects on tactile and gravitational senses can be pronounced. These range fromfeeling a dissociation of consciousness from the body to extremehypersensitivity to inner and outer physical stimuli. Emotional changes are also quite striking and can vacillate between abjectterror and indescribable bliss. Tremendous fluidity of emotion may exist, withrapid shifts between extremes of joy, anger, passion, hatred, shame, andgrandiosity. At other times, a person may feel nothing at all—that is, no humanemotions—or may feel the emotions of another being, either real or imagined, asone’s own. The process of thinking may speed up, slow down, or qualitatively change. It mayseem to these individuals as if they experience a different perspective orfilter on both thought processes and thought content itself. Those undergoingpsychedelics’ effects might experience new personal or philosophical insights,or find themselves devoid of thought and unable to process any cognitiveinformation. They may be able to unite opposites or see striking differenceswithin some previously perceived unity. In addition, there may be an effect onthe sense of reality: what they experience may feel “more real than real” or mayfeel totally unreal. Information arises from novel sources—a flower or cloud mayimpart new insights and reveal hidden meanings in nature. The beings or entitiesin their visions may communicate—about themselves, the person in the drug state,or the nature of reality. Those under the influence of psychedelics may experience a change inrelationship to the “other.” Usually, there is increased suggestibility: it iseasier to be affected or swayed by others. Sensitivity to interpersonal cues andbody language impart previously unappreciated features of those who are“other”—strengths, conflicts, relatedness, and emotional states. Further, theirown personality may change in directions they don’t expect or anticipate.Perhaps they may gain more voluntary control over their reactions to people.They might also experience an expanded sense of empathy with nonhuman entitiessuch as animals, plants, rocks, and even machines. SET AND SETTING In addition to qualitatively unique effects on consciousness, experiencesinduced by psychedelic drugs are exquisitely sensitive to matters of set andsetting. Researchers developed the concepts of set and setting, discussed infurther detail below, to help explain the extraordinarily variable effects ofpsychedelics regardless of whether the same dose is given to different people orthe same dose is given to the same person at different times.19[index_split_017.html#filepos819843] This variance is in contrast to the image[images/00006.jpg]s and image [images/00007.jpg]s, which usually produce similareffects among different people and within the same person even at differenttimes. In the case of psychedelics, we must pay special attention to the inner andouter environments of the individual taking them, because these may haveprofound effects on the psychedelic drug reaction. In some ways, set and settingcolor a taker’s reaction to a psychedelic drug as much as the dose of the drugitself. Set usually refers to who a person is at the time of ingesting and experiencingthe effects of the drug. It contains both an individual’s state at that time andhis or her more enduring biological and psychological traits. The state includesboth psychological and physiological factors such as present mood, currenthealth or illness, food recently eaten or drunk, level of anxiety, and attitudetoward and previous experiences with psychedelics. Traits take into account morepervasive, long-standing psychological and biological qualities, such asgenerosity or stinginess, acceptance or rejection of novelty, and being trustingor suspicious of human warmth. We also must include the hard-wiring of theperson, such as the number and sensitivity of certain receptors in the brain andother organs. Setting refers to the external environment in which a person takes the drug. Ifthe psychedelic experience takes place outdoors, is the environment pleasant,safe, and comfortable or unpleasantly rainy, windy, loud, dangerous, orchaotically urban? If a drug is taken indoors, is the environment warm, safe,dry, and homey or high-tech, sterile, and filled with machines and testingimplements? Just as important, setting also refers to those around the taker. Are theysupportive or hostile to the person or to the nature of the psychedelic drugexperience? Have they taken a psychedelic themselves? This latter question hasto do with basic issues of empathy and informed consent; in other words, canthose nearby truly empathize with what the taker is experiencing, and how wellhave they explained or can they explain what to expect under the influence? Didthey give the drug to the taker—and if so, why? Did they do so for research anddatagathering purposes? Was their intent psychotherapeutic, shamanic, orreligious? Did they simply desire to party or to take advantage of the taker’sheightened suggestibility and passivity? It is also important to learn if theybelieve psychedelics cause insanity or a mystical experience. Otherconsiderations are how they are dressed, how they smell, and how they movearound the space. We should note that much of the conflicting data from the first generation ofstudies with psychedelics resulted from a lack of attention to and reporting ofset and setting—particularly the latter. The fundamental assessment of apsychedelic experience as either good or bad depends to a large degree uponpaying careful attention to comfort and safety issues, and how those in thetaker’s proximity deal with his or her anxiety when it arises. ADVERSE EFFECTS Psychedelics may have either physical or psychological adverse effects—or both.The classical psychedelic drugs are physically safe; I have been unable tolocate any reports of deaths from overdoses directly attributable to theiringestion. Yet under these drugs’ influence, people may engage in behavior thatcan result in significant morbidity or mortality, such as jumping from a rooftopbecause they believe they can fly. In the mid-1960s to early-1970s, much media attention highlighted reports ofchromosome damage and birth defects in children born to mothers who had takenLSD during pregnancy.20 [index_split_017.html#filepos820137] Later,more-rigorous and better-controlled research studies refuted the earlieralarmist ones, though they garnered much less attention.21[index_split_017.html#filepos820440] As for adverse psychological effects, these include those that occur during theacute psychedelic drug intoxication, such as paranoia, confusion, and disorderedself-control. These are time-limited phenomena. These time-limited effects, infact, were cited to support the proposition that psychedelic drugs were usefulin producing a clinically relevant, discrete episode of psychosis in thepsychotomimetic model. When these frightened, disorganized individuals needtreatment, the first response is to provide a quiet, nonstimulating, supportive,and reassuring environment—the “talking down” approach. More-severe reactions ofanxiety or potentially dangerous levels of agitation may require antianxiety orantipsychotic medication. The potentially traumatic nature of a full-blown psychedelic experience can leadto significant psychiatric morbidity after acute drug effects have worn off. Yetearly research investigators found that these “psychedelic casualties” wererare. The low incidence of such outcomes was the result of carefully screeningvolunteers, closely monitoring their sessions, and providing supportivefollow-up as indicated. When disturbed psychological functioning did persistbeyond twenty-four hours, it appeared that the particular syndrome was apsychedelic-precipitated event, rather than a specific LSD psychosis.Distressing, intense psychological effects of a psychedelic drug experiencecould therefore trigger manic, depressive, anxiety, or psychotic disorders. Inother words, the psychedelic drug effect may be akin to other psychic traumassuch as rape, a natural disaster, and battle shock. Case studies of emergency room visits and psychiatric hospitalizations in peoplewho have taken LSD or similar psychedelics usually revealed previously existingpsychological instability or actual mental illness in most of the individuals.In addition, these patients often used other drugs in combination withpsychedelics, such as alcohol, amphetamine, and PCP. Finally, the impact of setand setting variables limited the ability to generalize to a supervisedenvironment the effects of these drugs as described in these psychedeliccasualty reports. Longer-term or delayed symptoms attributed to LSD and other psychedelics includeflashbacks and posthallucinogen perceptual disorder. Flashbacks are episodes ofreexperiencing certain sensory, cognitive, or emotional features of thepsychedelic experience after an intervening drug-free period. Most people whohave these experiences do not report them to clinicians, because they find theminteresting, enjoyable, or time-limited. Only when flashbacks interfere withordinary function and cause distress do people report such symptoms to careproviders. Flashbacks appear to be a generalization phenomenon—that is, certain internal orexternal cues remind the person of his or her psychedelic experience and bringon other associated features of the intoxication. For example, an individualmight feel anxiety of a certain nature or pertaining to a certain conflict thatis similar to anxiety experienced in the psychedelic state, or a person mightreturn to where he or she had the initial experience or meet with someone withwhom the experience was shared. By virtue of the mind’s associative capacities,these triggers may elicit other features of the psychedelic intoxication such asvisual or cognitive effects. Treatment of flashbacks usually involvesreassurance and advice to strictly avoid any mind-altering drugs. In more severeor persistent cases, relaxation training, cognitive-behavioral approaches, orantianxiety medications may be useful.22 [index_split_017.html#filepos820711] There also exists a rare syndrome that may cause more subjective distress in anindividual than flashbacks. This posthallucinogen perceptual disorder (PHPD) isa troubling and at times debilitating disorder of mostly visual perception. Itsetiology is uncertain, and it is difficult to treat. PHPD may relate tokindling, a quasi-seizurelike phenomenon in visual pathways in the brain.Psychedelic drugs may have somehow overstimulated those pathways or the visualsystem may have been especially sensitive to their effects originally.23[index_split_017.html#filepos820985] Nevertheless, despite real risks to mental health that psychedelics pose for theuser and the continued great popularity of these drugs over the last thirty toforty years, psychedelic casualties have remained quite low for several decades.It appears that people are taking lower doses, at least in their initialexposure to these agents, and there exists a much greater awareness of the setand setting issues involved in minimizing adverse effects. THE SECOND GENERATION OF PSYCHEDELIC RESEARCH Human studies with psychedelic drugs resumed in Europe in the late 1980s withmescaline and in the United States in the early 1990s with DMT. These newinvestigations, rather modest in scope, have focused upon carefulcharacterization of drug effects using modern psychopharmacological techniques.To a large extent, these methodologies are the result of advances in nonhumananimal research that clinical investigators are now seeking to confirm or refutein humans. The conservative nature of this initial resumption of research is probably atleast partly the result of extreme sensitivity to the political nature of suchstudies in humans, particularly in the context of the “war on drugs,” andunpleasant associations with the seemingly drug-fueled youth movement of the1960s. Current research is progressing steadily in the United States and Europe.It has branched out into experiments using psilocybin to treatobsessive-compulsive disorder, to investigate the nature of the mysticalexperience, and to help the pain and suffering associated with terminal cancerand post-traumatic stress disorder. It is interesting to note that no new LSDstudies have begun. In addition, social scientists in anthropology, education, and religious studiescontinue to develop new theories and approaches to the optimal use ofpsychedelics based upon their fieldwork and their analyses of the historical useof these agents within other cultures. Two websites that provide current information regarding ongoing and anticipatedresearch studies with classical and atypical psychedelics (such as ketamine andMDMA) are www.heffter.org (the Heffter Research Institute) and www.maps.org(Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies). "},{"pageContent":"image [images/00004.jpg] 2image [images/00004.jpg] DMT The Brain’s Own Psychedelic Rick Strassman, M.D. We have known about the psychedelic effects produced by plants containing DMT,particularly from Latin America, much longer than we have known about DMTitself. In the 1600s, priest-ethnographers from Spain described Latin Americanindigenous people’s use of DMT-containing psychedelic snuffs and smokingmixtures made from the genus Anadenanthera. Intrepid nineteenth-century Europeanexplorers of the Amazon, such as Spruce, von Humboldt, and Koch-Grünberg,observed the preparation and use of ayahuasca containing DMT-rich plants,particularly Psychotria viridis in combination with Banisteriopsis caapi, whichcontains the enzyme inhibitors that allow DMT to become active orally. In thelast century, the late Richard Schultes was instrumental in carrying on thistradition of documenting the vibrant use of psychedelic plants in LatinAmerica.1 [index_split_017.html#filepos821415] The Canadian chemist Richard Manske first synthesized DMT in his laboratory in1931, as one of a series of tryptamine derivatives related to his research on atoxic North American shrub.2 [index_split_017.html#filepos821667] There is noevidence, however, that he was familiar with DMT’s psychoactivity, and we assumehe never used it himself. A 1946 Spanish-language scientific paper first described the presence of DMT inSouth American psychedelic snuffs,3 [index_split_017.html#filepos821925] and in1955 a comparable paper appeared in the English-language literature.4[index_split_017.html#filepos822232] While the presence of DMT in these plantswas now established, its psychoactivity was not. In 1955, Hungarian psychiatristand chemist Stephen Szára, stymied in his attempts to obtain LSD for researchbehind the Iron Curtain, decided to synthesize DMT based upon the papersdocumenting its presence in psychedelic plants. As so many research scientistsbefore him had done, Szára experimented on himself, swallowing ever-increasingdoses of the drug. Failing to note an effect through the oral route, he injectedhimself intramuscularly, and thus discovered the profound psychedelic activityof DMT: “In three or four minutes I started to experience visual sensations thatwere very similar to what I had read in descriptions by Hofmann [about LSD] andHuxley [about mescaline]. . . . I got very, very excited. It was obvious thiswas the secret.”5 [index_split_017.html#filepos822557] Szára soon thereafterrecruited thirty volunteers, mostly physician colleagues, to receive fullypsychedelic doses of DMT. One of these physicians described his experience: “The whole world is brilliant.. . . The whole room is filled with spirits. It makes me dizzy. . . . Now it istoo much! . . . I feel exactly as if I were flying. . . . I have the feelingthis is above everything, above the earth.” As effects wore off, he continued:“It is comforting to know I am back on earth again. . . . Everything has aspiritual tinge, but is so real. . . . I feel that I have landed. . . .”6[index_split_017.html#filepos822815] Szára soon thereafter immigrated to the United States, where he spent adistinguished career spanning more than three decades at the National Instituteon Drug Abuse, finally retiring in 1991. His research group in Hungary continuedwith some additional DMT studies, as did several U.S. groups, but within theacademic literature, no one was as thorough as Szára in documenting thesubjective effects of DMT. For example, the premier U.S. psychedelic researchsite at the time, the federal prison in Lexington, Kentucky, published reportson DMT used in its prisoner volunteers that described effects simply as “. . .anxiety, hallucinations (usually visual), and perceptual distortions.”7[index_split_017.html#filepos823104] Nevertheless, there were some tantalizingreports generated by European and U.S. labs that fall particularly within thecontext of this book’s focus, namely outlining contact with seeminglyautonomous, sentient, and interactive beings. For example, Szára’s former Hungarian colleagues noted the experience of oneschizophrenic patient on DMT: “I saw such a strange dream, but at the beginningonly. . . . I saw strange creatures, dwarves or something; they were black andmoved about.”8 [index_split_017.html#filepos823425] An American team alsostudying the effects of DMT in psychotic patients reported one volunteer’sexperience: “I was in a big place, and they were hurting me. They were nothuman. . . . They were horrible! I was living in a world of orange people.”9[index_split_017.html#filepos823690] These reports of DMT effects, both from the late 1950s, are the only ones I havefound in the peer-reviewed academic scientific literature that describe contactwith beings, despite the vastly greater number of studies describing effects ofLSD and other better-known psychedelics. DMT garnered a rather negative reputation on the street based upon some popularliterature describing its effects. Naked Lunch, by William Burroughs, isprobably the most widely read account of the tendency of DMT to overwhelm itsusers with its rapid onset and disorienting “rush.” DMT emerged from its relative scientific obscurity, especially relative to LSD,when scientists discovered that both it and the necessary enzymes for itssynthesis were present in laboratory animals. In 1965, German scientistsdemonstrated that DMT is present in human blood and urine.10[index_split_017.html#filepos823957] Soon thereafter, brain and cerebrospinalfluid (which bathes both the brain and the spinal cord) were also found tocontain DMT. The requisite enzymes, similar to those in nonhumans, were alsofound in brain and lung cells and red blood cells. Thus, the endogenous natureof DMT, its short duration of action, and its possible role in psychosis made itthe object of substantial scientific inquiry. Nevertheless, DMT suffered a fate both similar to and, in some ways, even moretragic than that which befell LSD during the antipsychedelic furor of the late1960s and early 1970s. The relevance of its unique endogenicity was limited tobeing a possible cause of mental illness, primarily schizophrenia. When studiesmeasuring its presence in various human body fluids failed to demonstratesignificant differences between normal volunteers and those with psychoticillness, enthusiasm waned. Rather than refine the assay technology for DMT tomeasure more accurately the very low endogenous levels found in human bodyfluids or the diagnostic criteria by which to parse research subjects, thestudies lost momentum. The most quoted paper in this field remains a Britishreport that describes fluctuations in DMT levels in psychotic patientscorrelating with their level of psychosis.11[index_split_017.html#filepos824271] By limiting the importance of endogenous DMT to mental illness, psychiatry lostan opportunity to study the more general topic of human consciousness and itsperturbations. Even if DMT was ultimately not found to be involved in psychosis,it may have been shown that it was involved in nonpsychotic altered states ofconsciousness such as mystical, spiritual, and near-death. This, however, was more than psychiatry wished to undertake at the time.Psychedelic drugs were high-risk as a reputable research agenda, as was anyattempt to relate them to religious sensibilities. Though there existedpsychiatric research groups that tackled thorny religious issues withpsychedelics, such as the University of Maryland12[index_split_017.html#filepos824626] and Johns Hopkins University,13[index_split_017.html#filepos824925]the relationship between endogenous DMT andendogenous spiritual experiences seems to have been overlooked. WHAT IS DMT? N,N-dimethyltryptamine, the prototypical tryptamine psychedelic, is first andforemost a chemical entity. It contains twelve carbon atoms, sixteen hydrogens,and two nitrogens. Its molecular weight—the combined value of the weights of allits elements, relative to the 1 of hydrogen—is 188. This is only slightly morethan that of glucose, the simple sugar providing all of our body’s energy, whichis 180. The weight of DMT is only ten times greater than that of water, which is18. Thus, we are dealing with a relatively small, simple molecule. Pure DMT is a waxy or crystalline substance at room temperature and usually hasa slightly orange-pink tinge. It may smell slightly like mothballs due to itsindole ring. DMT’s pharmacological profile is fairly well understood. It bindsto the same subtypes of serotonin receptors as do the other classicalpsychedelics such as LSD: the 5HT2A and 5-HT1A sites.14[index_split_017.html#filepos825303] A unique pharmacological property of DMT—different from the nonendogenouspsychedelics such as LSD, psilocybin, and mescaline—is the lack of tolerancethat develops after repeated dosing of the drug. If it is given daily at thesame dose, LSD becomes less effective.15 [index_split_017.html#filepos825521]Even if it is given more frequently in lower animals, however, DMT does notelicit behavioral tolerance.16 [index_split_017.html#filepos825927] In our humanDMT research, giving the drug several times at half-hour intervals in onesitting, we also demonstrated a lack of tolerance development.17[index_split_017.html#filepos826318] Our data confirmed and extended previouscomparable human findings using less frequent dosing of DMT.18[index_split_017.html#filepos826678] Another unique feature of DMT is its active transport into the brain across theblood–brain barrier. Cells that are tightly glued together line the brain’sblood vessels, preventing movement of most blood-borne chemicals into thebrain’s confines, yet the brain sometimes expends energy to acquire some crucialmolecules via active transport across the blood–brain barrier. Examples of suchmolecules are glucose, the brain’s fuel source, and certain amino acids that thebrain is unable to synthesize on its own. DMT is one of these selectcompounds,19 [index_split_017.html#filepos826997]though why the brain expendsenergy to bring DMT into its confines remains a mystery. It is tempting topostulate, however, that just as glucose is necessary for the brain’s function,so in some mysterious way is DMT. HOW DO PEOPLE CONSUME DMT? Most street use of DMT involves vaporizing and then inhaling pure DMT in thefree-base form—that is, the DMT is not chemically combined with an acid to forma water-soluble salt. This is similar to cocaine free base, which is smoked, ascompared to cocaine hydrochloride, which is cocaine free base dissolved inhydrochloric acid, which therefore makes the salt (cocaine hydrochloride) watersoluble, because a water-soluble salt provides more efficient uptake orally,nasally, or by injection. In our studies, the acid providing the mostwater-soluble form of DMT was fumaric acid. Therefore, we gave people DMTfumarate by injection. When smoking DMT, however, the free-base form is mostefficient. It is vaporized in a glass pipe and then inhaled, or it is placedonto combustible vegetable matter (such as inactive mint, parsley, mullein, ormarijuana) and inhaled along with the combusted plant material. When a person swallows DMT, digestive enzymes—the monoamine oxidases(MAOs)—break it down nearly instantly, and negligible DMT enters the bloodstreamand thus the brain. Latin American indigenous cultures discovered centuries agothat mixing plants containing DMT with other plants containing digestive enzymeblockers allows for very good transport of DMT through the gut. These enzymeblockers are the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), specifically thebeta-carboline compounds harmine, harmaline, and tetra-hydro-harmine. Onlyrelatively recently has this pharmacology been well understood, having beenelucidated primarily by Dennis McKenna while he worked at the University ofBritish Columbia, in Canada.20 [index_split_017.html#filepos827556] WHERE IS DMT FOUND? DMT exists in our bodies and in the bodies of all mammals in which scientistshave searched for its presence. In addition, an enormous number of plants fromboth temperate and tropical climes contain DMT. Marine sponges containwater-soluble salts of DMT, as may some corals. Magic mushrooms contain psilocin(4-hydroxy-DMT—that is, DMT with an extra oxygen and hydrogen attached to one ofits carbons), but the presence of DMT itself in these mushrooms remainsdifficult to establish. While DMT is not thought to be present in fish,serotonin does exist in this family, as do the subtypes of serotonin receptorsnecessary for DMT effects. The venom of the Sonora Desert toad, Bufo alvarius,contain 5-methoxy-DMT, a close psychedelic relative of DMT.21[index_split_017.html#filepos827923] DMT is present in the brain of lower mammals at birth, and levels rise in thebrain of these animals in response to stress.22[index_split_017.html#filepos828118] As previously mentioned, dozens of studiescite that DMT has been found in human blood, urine, and spinal fluid. Scientistshave isolated the gene that synthesizes the DMT-forming enzyme in humans andhave inserted this gene into a virus. After they infect mammalian cells withthis virus, the cells produce DMT in the test tube.23[index_split_017.html#filepos828426] A DMT–PINEAL GLAND CONNECTION? Early on, my attention was drawn to the pineal gland as a sort of spirit gland,a physical organ whose function might be associated with spiritual or otherhighly altered states of consciousness. There are several lines ofcircumstantial evidence linking the pineal gland and endogenous psychedelicstates. Some of these are metaphysical or metaphorical, others are more firmlyrooted in biology but are nevertheless still speculative. The pineal gland’slong history of association with consciousness and spirit intrigued me. Thelocation of this gland is mirrored by the location of the highest Hindu chakra,as well as Jewish sephira, and is associated with the highest level of spiritualdevelopment in esoteric physiology systems. Over the centuries, the pineal gland’s unpaired status in the brain has alsodrawn the interest of philosophers, including Descartes. He noticed that partsof the brain exist in pairs—two amygdalas, two hippocampuses, and so forth. Hebelieved that the pineal’s unpaired status supported his hypothesis that itmediated the phenomenon of our being able to think of only one thing at a time.Through some admittedly highly speculative reasoning, Descartes proposed thatthe pineal gland’s unpaired status was supporting evidence for it providing themost direct avenue of this one-thought-at-a-time communication between divinity(the source of our intellect) and our brain.24[index_split_017.html#filepos828807] The pineal gland functions as a third eye in amphibians and certain reptilesfrom its position on the surface of the top of the skull, complete with lens,cornea, and retina. It receives light information, which is used to regulateskin color and body temperature. In mammals, the pineal has moved deeper intothe brain, but indirectly, through the eyes, it continues to receive informationabout ambient lighting conditions. In mammals, the most studied pineal producthas been melatonin, which appears to have a role in reproduction, alertness, andtemperature regulation. When melatonin did not prove especially psychoactive in our studies of itsphysiology in normal humans,25 [index_split_017.html#filepos829033] I lookedmore carefully into the possibility that the pineal gland might synthesize DMT.While this has never been established, the necessary precursors and enzymes forDMT synthesis exist in high concentrations in the pineal gland. It is locatedquite fortuitously near crucial sensory relay stations in the brain, so ifindeed the pineal gland does secrete DMT at certain times, its proximity tothese brain centers could explain the highly visual and auditory nature of manymystical and other endogenous psychedelic experiences. Furthermore, it is extraordinarily difficult to stimulate the pineal gland toproduce melatonin. Highly efficient sumps near the pineal gland form a nearlyimpregnable barrier to stimulation by the neurotransmitters that normallyregulate melatonin production. Melatonin’s psychological and biological effectsare rather subtle, and require a relatively long period of time to exert theireffects. Because of this, we must wonder what other pineal products require suchtight regulation. The pineal gland’s potential production of DMT would helpexplain the need for such pineal gland protection, for widely fluctuating levelsof DMT would not be in an individual’s best survival interests. It is worthnoting, in this regard, that of all the biological parameters we measured thatshowed extremely robust elevations in response to a high dose of DMT, the onlyone that did not rise at all was melatonin!26[index_split_017.html#filepos829357] At this point, the pineal gland–DMT connection must remain speculative. Yetthere are plenty of other organs that do produce DMT—including brain, bloodcells, and lungs—and its endogenicity remains a fact we must contend with. Itraises the obvious and compelling question: Why do we possess DMT in our bodies? UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO DMT RESEARCH There were several reasons driving my decision to begin psychedelic researchwith DMT, rather than with better-known drugs such as LSD, mescaline, andpsilocybin. 1. DMT is short-acting. I knew that the clinical research center environment inwhich I needed to begin such studies would most likely be rather onerous andunpleasant. It was a setup for potential bad trips or panic reactions. I alsorealized I had no experience administering psychedelic drugs to people. Thus, Idid not have a great deal of confidence in dealing with adverse reactions,should they develop. I believed that DMT’s short duration of action would work to our benefit on bothcounts. Adverse reactions, should they occur, would likely be short-lived. Inaddition, I would have less opportunity to make the wrong intervention in anattempt to help our volunteers if my time to intervene was so limited. I couldrely more upon the volunteers’ intrinsic restorative resources than my ownuncertain ability to modify the course of a bad trip. 2. DMT is relatively obscure. I believed there might be tremendous curiosity onthe part of the public and media regarding the resumption of psychedelicresearch in the United States after such a lengthy hiatus. I also believed thatcuriosity, and perhaps hostility and sensationalistic coverage, would be thatmuch greater if drugs with 1960s-associated notoriety were the objects of ourstudy. Research with LSD (acid), psilocybin (magic mushrooms), or mescaline(peyote buttons) would be potentially prone to much more scrutiny and perhapseven resistance on the part of regulatory, licensing, and funding bodies thanthat with a relatively unknown drug. 3. DMT is endogenous. This cut both ways in my mind: one being a support for itsstudy within a traditional psychiatric research framework and the other withinmy own, less well-articulated agenda. From the psychiatric research perspective,I argued that DMT remained the most suitable candidate for the role of anendogenous psychotomimetic compound. Understanding its effects, and themechanisms of action by which it exerted those effects, would shed light on theetiology of endogenous psychoses such as mania and schizophrenia. In addition tohelping us understand the causes of such illnesses, to the extent thatendogenous DMT contributed to endogenous psychoses, drugs that demonstratedefficacy in blocking the effects of exogenous DMT might also prove therapeuticby reducing endogenous DMT-related psychotic symptoms. Regarding some of my deeper reasons for investigating DMT, I was interested inthe biological bases of naturally occurring psychedelic experiences, such asmystical and near-death states. If exogenous DMT reliably replicated all or partof such experiences, this would bolster my theory that endogenous DMT played arole in their occurrence. Somewhat straddling the more-and less-overt reasonsfor my work with DMT was a consideration of the therapeutic properties of DMT inparticular and of psychedelics in general. I wanted to see firsthand the effectsof DMT, as a representative of the psychedelic family of drugs, on some of theprocesses important to psychotherapy. For example, I wanted to observe theeffects of DMT on nonverbal behavior, on the feelings and thoughts of theintoxicated individual toward the outside world (including myself), and on thetransformation and representation of psychological conflicts into more symboliccurrencies, such as visions. I also wanted to gain experience with people to whom I was providing a highlyaltered psychedelic state. By doing this, I hoped to develop and hone my ownempathetic and supportive skills in order to understand and, when needed, todirect complex and confusing drug-induced mental states. These sorts of factorswould come into play in any future attempts to articulate a research plan anddevelop a psychotherapeutic approach that utilized deep psychedelic states. One of the most important lessons I learned in my clinical research training aswell as from my previous melatonin research is the importance of asking simplequestions, no matter how abstract, complex, or poorly formed my ultimateresearch questions might be. I learned that when I ask simple, one-stepquestions, I don’t need an especially complicated experimental design to answerthem. I can develop experience and expertise in the field, which will mean thatany subsequent questions I have are that much more sophisticated and answerable. In the case of my proposed DMT work, the additional burden imposed by itscontroversial nature and complex regulatory logistics made even more importantthe design of a study that could generate solid, irrefutable results—objectivedata within a short time frame and with the least risk. Additionally, thetwenty-five-year hiatus in U.S. research, and the underlying reasons for thishiatus, compounded our burden of developing a research protocol with a highlikelihood of approval and funding. In a way, we needed to reinvent the wheel:in addition to our basic clinical research design, we needed to build in to ourstudies mechanisms by which we could allay regulators’ inherent anxiety aboutreopening what had become a Pandora’s box during the first phase of psychiatricresearch with psychedelics. Therefore, we needed to clearly state that one of our research goals was thecarefully considered recruitment of suitable volunteers. At this delicate stageof early negotiations, psychedelic-naive volunteers were not an option. We couldnot risk giving DMT to people who had no idea what to expect, and who wereincapable of truly giving informed consent. Informed consent depends upon avolunteer having some familiarity with the expected effects of theirparticipation in a study—for example, nausea and a pounding pulse. In the caseof DMT, which was most likely guaranteed to elicit intensely novel andunexpected thoughts, feelings, and perceptions, psychedelic-nave prospectivevolunteers were at a disadvantage by not really knowing what we were talkingabout. Even the most experienced psychedelic veteran knows that it is impossibleto predict how any particular trip will turn out. As Terence McKenna was fond ofsaying regarding smoking DMT, “One’s hands always shake lighting the pipe.”Thus, the issue of whom we chose as volunteers was crucial. I thought we muststudy only experienced psychedelic users, and they needed to be psychologicallyand physically healthy. One factor that played into this decision was that of adverse effects. Ibelieved that those with previous psychedelic experience would be less likely topanic in our study because of their familiarity with the strangeness of thepsychedelic experience, even if they had not actually taken DMT previously. Infact, one of the most important questions I asked prospective volunteers was nothow much they had enjoyed their previous psychedelic experiences, but rather howbad any of their previous trips had been. I needed to know that a volunteercould articulate fears, ask for help, and take advantage of any assistanceoffered. For example, one prospective volunteer told me that whenever he took ahigh dose of psilocybin mushrooms, he regularly found himself on top of abuilding’s roof, without knowing how he got there. Clearly, he was an unsuitablesubject for a study in which all subjects would be strictly confined to ahospital bed for several hours, with various tubes, wires, and the like attachedto their bodies! The nature of the subjective reports—the information our volunteers wouldprovide—was another important consideration in my decision to use experiencedsubjects. I believed experienced subjects would give more discerning and nuanceddescriptions of drug effects, and could compare DMT to other psychedelics withwhich they were familiar. Another, more liability-based reason was theuniversity lawyers’ concern that we avoid having any psychedelic-nave individualbecome a psychedelic “addict” and then blame us for this development. We also had to establish, in this first project, that we could administervarious doses of DMT in a safe manner. In order to begin this process, we neededto learn the best way to administer DMT and the optimal doses that would producethe desired effects. All but one previous scientific study with DMT used the intramuscular (IM)route. While allowing for relatively rapid absorption of a drug relative to theoral route, it is not as rapid as the smoked, intravenous (IV) or intranasal(snorted) route. We began by giving a moderately high dose of IM DMT to twovolunteers who had smoked DMT free base in the past and who were also familiarwith the effects of oral DMT from their experiences with ayahuasca. We believedthese two volunteers were ideal subjects with whom to begin preliminarydose-finding and an optimal route of administration. Our two seasoned DMTvolunteers reported that the rush—the rapidly developing wave of effectscharacteristic of smoked DMT—did not occur with the IM route. Neither was theintensity of the peak effects comparable to that of smoked DMT. Because ourfunding came primarily from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, we had to makeour studies as relevant as possible to the institute’s charge of understandingeffects and mechanisms of actions of drugs of abuse in the manner in which theyare normally taken. Smoking, however, was not an option because of the potential for lung toxicityfrom combustion by-products. In addition, it is very difficult technically toreliably inhale a drug while at the same time trying to negotiate its early,often disorienting effects. Therefore, we switched to the IV route, which provedto be a little more rapid and intense than even the smoked route. After sometrial-and-error work, we settled on a range of IV DMT doses from very low (0.05mg/kg) to very high (0.4 mg/kg), with two intermediate doses (0.1 and 0.2mg/kg), encompassing the full range of DMT effects. There are about 2.2 poundsin a kilogram, so there are about 73 kg in a 160-pound person. A high (0.4mg/kg) dose of IV DMT in that sized person is slightly more than 29 mg. The variables we decided to measure in response to these doses covered a widearray of those employed in classical psychopharmacology studies, particularlythose we believed DMT would stimulate by virtue of its effects on serotonergicsystems. These included pupil diameter, blood pressure, heart rate, bodytemperature, and a host of pituitary-gland hormones and other hormonescontrolled by brain regions rich in serotonin receptors: prolactin; growthhormone; adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), which stimulates the adrenalgland; beta-endorphin; and cortisol from the adrenals. We also looked atmelatonin levels, presumably of pineal gland origin. We also needed to measureblood levels of DMT after each dose so that we could establish relationshipsbetween dose of drug and resultant blood level and between DMT blood levels andoutcome measures. Measuring all of the hormones for our study involved purchasing assay kits thatour highly trained laboratory technicians could use. However, there were noassays currently available for DMT, which meant we needed to consult withseveral senior scientists at other sites who had worked with their own assays inthe past. We were lucky to find an assay whose developer generously helped usestablish it at the University of New Mexico (UNM). Within six months, we wereable to measure DMT levels down to the millionth of a gram (a nanogram) permilliliter—not sensitive enough to measure endogenous levels, but quite adequatefor our purposes of measuring the much higher levels that occurred when weinjected our volunteers with the drug. Finally, I set as a goal the development of a new rating scale for DMT effects:a paper-and-pencil questionnaire, filled out by the volunteers themselvesdirectly after drug effects had worn off. I hoped our scale would be atheoretical and practical improvement over previous rating scales, whichquantified these effects in order to facilitate statistical manipulation ofsubjective data. These earlier scales had several inherent flaws. Someemphasized unpleasant over pleasant effects of the drugs—which might steer asubject’s subsequent drug sessions toward a more negative outcome. Moreimportant, however, is that such an emphasis on unpleasant effects ignored thepositive or reinforcing properties of psychedelics—those effects that led peopleto use them. In other words, people take psychedelics for their uniquelypositive—not negative—effects. Another drawback of older rating scales was theiruse of penitentiary inmates serving time for federal narcotics violations as thenormative sample. These individuals hoped their participation would assist inobtaining either an early release or preferential treatment in prison. Inaddition, few if any had previous experience with psychedelic drugs. Therefore,they were not a representative sample from which to generalize to the rest ofthe population. I interviewed nineteen experienced DMT users who also had substantial experiencewith other psychedelics in order to both prepare a first draft of the ratingscale and to anticipate issues that would arise in supervising each DMT session.In drafting the Hallucinogen Rating Scale, or HRS, I chose the Buddhistpsychological system, the Abhidharma, as a model for the psychology of thepsychedelic experience. I appreciated the Abhidharma’s relatively objective,phenomenological, and value-free approach to mental contents and processes. Theessence of its classification approach is to parse mental experience into fivecategories, those related to: emotions; thought and thought processes;perceptions (visual, auditory, taste, and smell); bodily sensations; andvolition (the ability to interact willfully with external and internalrealities). To these five I added a sixth, a general measure of intensity. While not going into any further detail regarding the development of the HRS andthe data generated by it, it is worth noting that it has held up quite wellagainst older, and even some newer, rating scales. In addition, in our ownstudies, it proved more sensitive to effects of various doses of DMT than didany of our multiple biological variables.27 [index_split_017.html#filepos829697]Many research groups, both in the United States and in Canada, Europe, and SouthAmerica, have used it successfully in their own projects involving the study ofa diverse range of psychedelic and other psychoactive drugs. It took two years of lobbying of local university, state, and federal regulatoryagencies before I obtained permission to begin the DMT research. A grant from abranch of the Masons, the Scottish Rite Foundation for Schizophrenia Research,helped establish the merit of my study a year before I actually began it. Whythe Masons had an interest in schizophrenia in general, and DMT in particular, Ido not know, but I believe that garnering such support enhanced the esteem of mystudy in the eyes of the relevant regulatory and funding agencies. The finalhurdle to overcome was to locate a source of pharmaceutical-grade DMT that waspure enough for approval for human administration by the U.S. Food and DrugAdministration. Professor David E. Nichols, of Purdue University, agreed tosynthesize a batch for our studies, and we began our research soon thereafter,in late 1990.28 [index_split_017.html#filepos830079] Before wrapping up the first phase of research five years later, in mid-1995, wehad given four hundred doses of DMT in various strengths to more than sixtyvolunteers in seven DMT studies. We had also begun some dose-finding pilot workwith psilocybin, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms. Whereas the clinicalresearch center environment, onerous as it was, seemed to assuage the anxiety ofour DMT volunteers, who sometimes feared they were dying and were relieved torecall that a hospital-based resuscitation team was readily available, itquickly proved intolerable for the longer-acting effects of psilocybin. Thus, wecut short our psilocybin study and never began an LSD project for which we hadfunding, approval, and drug on hand. NOTES ON PROTOCOL Using three levels of examination, I screened all potential volunteers carefullybefore they received any drug. The first level was an interview that wasstructured loosely and revolved around a potential subject’s interest inparticipation and previous psychedelic drug experience—particularly with respectto how he or she managed disturbing or frightening effects as well as how “farout” he had gone in his psychedelic journeys. In this latter case, I wanted toknow if any had experienced a near-death or mystical state or the feeling thathis consciousness and body had separated—all effects I thought might berelatively common during our studies. I also inquired about the support systemprospective volunteers had at their disposal, for I knew the psychologicaldemands of the study required more social and emotional support than just ourresearch team would likely be able to provide. At that time, I gave a generaloverview of my research interest in these drugs and in DMT in particular anddescribed the theory behind and protocol involved in the particular study forwhich I was recruiting. I warned prospective subjects of the intrusive,rigorous, clinical nature of their participation, and was clear about itsabsolutely voluntary nature, adding that they could withdraw from participationat any time with no undue consequences. We would provide whatever follow-up theyneeded, including making appropriate referrals. The next step in screening was a standardized psychiatric interview to excludeany individual with a current psychiatric diagnosis, and if it was determinedthat a prior psychiatric diagnosis had existed, to ascertain the severity of theprevious problem and the adequacy of treatment, and to determine that asufficiently long period had elapsed between the present time and itsresolution. The last stage involved a physical examination, laboratory blood tests, andelectrocardiogram to ensure that a prospective volunteer was healthy enough tomanage the physically demanding nature of the DMT infusions, particularly theheart rate and blood pressure effects. After passing these three layers of screening, the volunteer received a low 0.05mg/kg dose of DMT and high 0.4 mg/kg dose of the drug on consecutive days, atwhich time only blood pressure, heart rate, and psychological responses weremonitored. These screening doses were intended to familiarize volunteers withthe mechanics of the DMT infusion in the clinical research environment and withthe most powerful and intense experience they would encounter during theirparticipation. If any volunteer found either the hospital setting or the highdose of DMT too unpleasant, he or she could drop out before we had spent thetime, energy, and funds involved in any of the full-scale studies. These daysalso allowed us to get a sense of how people reacted to the research environmentand to the effects of DMT. For all the sessions, volunteers lay prone in a hospital bed, in a slightly morecheery, informal, and comfortably furnished room in the University of New MexicoHospital’s fifth-floor General Clinical Research Center. An IV line was insertedinto a subject’s forearm vein, and a cuff leading to an automated blood pressureand heart rate monitor was attached to the other arm. We gave the DMT solutionover a thirty-second infusion through plastic tubing into the forearm vein andthen flushed the tubing with sterile salt water for fifteen seconds. After this,we checked blood pressure and heart rate for the next thirty minutes, anddiscussed the experience starting at about fifteen to twenty minutes after theinjection. Once any pressing issues were dealt with, the volunteer filled outthe rating scale, after which we discussed at length his or her just completedexperience. The subject then ate a snack or light meal, napped as he or shewished, and went home. For actual full-scale study days, a second IV line was placed in the other armof each subject to provide access for drawing blood samples throughout thesession. A thin, flexible rectal temperature monitor was inserted in order torecord temperature automatically every minute and send this information to adevice from which we downloaded data after the session’s completion. In ourfirst study, we also asked volunteers to open their eyes at prearranged times sothat I could measure pupil diameter using a reference card with black circles.For all other studies, however, because of the intensely visual and disorientingeffects of the drug, particularly during its onset, we no longer measured pupildiameter, and had volunteers wear comfortable black eyeshades for theirsessions. In chapter 3, we will discuss the actual trip reports of thevolunteers who participated in our studies.

Regarding the first comparison, peopleunder the influence of a high dose of a psychedelic drug often are relativelyregressed: helpless, suggestible, and dependent. They may have lost control ofbodily, emotional, and thinking functions, and are unable to communicateeffectively. They may project all kinds of positive or negative feelings uponthe sitter that would be more appropriately placed on important, powerful peoplefrom other times or places in their lives—usually their parents or comparablefigures. At the same time, their behavior can stir up in the observer verypowerful and sometimes confusing feelings. To watch over a psychedelicizedperson in your care, then, you must manifest great tact, loving firmness andconsistency, support, education, and attentiveness—all in the proper dose and atthe proper time. The term sitting also refers to the importance of an observer staying as focusedand centered as possible while psychedelic chaos is breaking loose all around.The intensity of energy in the room of a person on psychedelic drugs can bepalpable, and it may require great effort for a sitter to maintain equanimity.During our research, I found it useful to enter into a light meditative stateelicited by the simple practice of feeling my breath pass in and out through mynostrils as my eyes were half-open and gazing slightly downward. This take onsitting provided our research volunteers with the necessary combination offreedom and support to have their own trip without the imposition of unnecessarystructure, suggestions, or distractions. It also provided them with a sense thatwe were readily available, and willing and able to help whenever the need arose. GENERAL OUTLINE OF DMT EFFECTS Volunteers described the two lower doses of DMT as not particularly psychedelic.The 0.05 mg/kg dose was relaxing and slightly euphoric, and the 0.1 mg/kg dosewas somewhat unpleasantly stimulating. Most volunteers found the 0.2 mg/kg dosecaused them to break through a threshold into more typical psychedelic effects.The 0.4 mg/kg dose was even more intensely psychedelic, and seemed to elicitsome qualitatively unique experiences. A 0.4 mg/kg dose of DMT began exerting its effects within several heartbeats,well before completion of the thirty-second drug infusion. By the sixty-secondpoint, when I was withdrawing the syringe that had just flushed the IV withsterile saltwater, volunteers were usually no longer aware of their physicalsurroundings. Effects peaked at two minutes postinjection, began fading withinthree to five minutes, and were usually nearly completely resolved by thirtyminutes. Some volunteers were able to speak within ten minutes, but I encouragedthem to remain silent for another five to ten minutes, so that they couldcontinue carefully observing the latter part of the drug experience. This extratime also allowed for a smoother reentry into normal consciousness. The initialrush of a high dose of DMT was intense, developed at startling speed, and couldnot help but be disorienting, at least temporarily. Some expressions describingthis rush: “a nuclear cannon,” “ground zero,” and “a freight train.” A tremendous sense of inner tension developed in the subjects—to a degree thatvolunteers did not believe their bodies were capable of containing it. Thisbuildup of inner tension was accompanied most often by a similarly buildinghigh-pitched whining, ringing, or crackling sound. While the rush and sound weredeveloping, there was a concomitant display of rapidly emerging fluid andmorphing kaleidoscopic visual patterns. Finally, for most volunteers, thisculminated in an abrupt separation of consciousness from the body. It was as iftheir consciousness could not remain attached to the body because of theinternal pressure generated by the rush. We regularly heard comments such as “My body dissolved; I was pure awareness”and “I no longer had a body.” Often the movement of consciousness took either anupward direction or that of the body falling downward. Once set loose or freedfrom the distracting and frankly intolerable physical tension of the rush,volunteers were now able, in a less encumbered manner, to observe what was goingon around them. Visual effects were profound and nearly always began with thekaleidoscopic display of patterns, which took on “Mayan,” “Aztec,” or “Islamic”qualities and sometimes qualities of pixilation, “like being an inch from a TVscreen.” Usually in response to the higher doses, however, more formed,recognizable, and discrete visual images emerged. Early on in our studies, as drug effects took hold, most volunteers opened theireyes nearly involuntarily to deal with the astonishment of the rush and visualeffects as much as to look around the room to see if what they were visualizingwas “real.” An overlaying of their visions onto the outside room added to theirconfusion, however, and placing eyeshades over the volunteers’ eyes before druginjection reduced disorientation and provided an impetus for a deeperinvolvement with the experience. When their eyes were open, subjects describedobjects in the room appearing to undulate or shine with an intrinsic brightnessand a living, breathing quality. Some volunteers also reported a disarticulationin the perception of the normal fluidity of movements of others in the room.Movements seemed “robotic,” “jerky,” or “mechanical.” Though it was difficult, most volunteers—familiar as they were with high-dosepsychedelic experiences—were able to maintain awareness during the earlytumultuous moments of their high-dose session. They did an admirable job ofhanging on—that is, observing, and remembering the experience. Intense, rapidly shifting mood states were also a hallmark of the high dose,although a few volunteers reported a marked flatness or paucity of feelings.Nevertheless, most found these sessions extremely pleasurable—ecstatic andeuphoric. One of the most striking aspects of the intoxication was how muchexperience was packed into a short period of time, including a sense oftimelessness. A common feature of a high-dose psychedelic experience (as occursin non-drug-induced mystical states) is that time feels eternal—the “eternalnow.” In other words, time no longer seems to pass, at least not as we normallyexperience it. Thus, the occasion of a tremendous amount of activity takingplace in a relatively short span of real time usually led to our volunteersgasping in surprise when they learned how much time had actually elapsed betweendrug injection and the beginning of our subsequent conversation. DMT NONRESPONDERS It is interesting to note that three of our sixty volunteers had little or noreaction to a high dose of DMT. One of these three was a former monastic who hada meditation-induced mystical experience, but the other two—one of whom hadabsolutely no reaction to DMT—were otherwise ostensibly unremarkable in theirbackground, experiences, and personal characteristics.*3[index_split_016.html#filepos810519] The former monastic’s experience wastentative support for a corollary of my hypothesis that endogenous DMT isinvolved in spontaneous mystical experiences—that is, once subjects gainfamiliarity with their own, endogenous, high-dose DMT states, additionalexogenous DMT has little further impact. This is not a case of drug tolerance assuch, but rather suggests learning to negotiate within the state ofconsciousness brought on by the drug (known in pharmacology as behavioraltolerance). The unremarkable characteristics of the other two volunteers,however, makes this explanation less likely. Perhaps it is easier to explain this resistance to DMT as something that occursin people whose relevant receptor mechanisms exist on the far end of thespectrum of responsiveness. Perhaps there are too few receptors or the“stickiness” of the receptors to DMT is very low. Another explanation could bethat some people metabolize DMT particularly efficiently. TYPES OF SESSIONS We parsed the volunteers’ DMT experiences into three general categories: * Personal. These were psychologically oriented sessions in which volunteers dealt primarily with their own lives, histories, circumstances, and feelings, whether these were conscious or unconscious. Often these sessions would yield deeper awareness and acceptance of difficult personal issues. * Transpersonal. These sessions went beyond the individual’s historical life experience, but continued to manifest within their own personal field of particulars: Though the state was novel in intensity and quality, it still consisted of the familiar building blocks from the subject’s previous experience. Mystical and near-death experiences fall into this category. * Invisible worlds. These comprised encounters with what seemed to be freestanding, autonomous realities that coexisted with our reality. Sometimes such realms appeared inhabited by alien beings that were more or less aware of the volunteers and were able to interact with them to varying degrees. Usually, sessions were not solely one type or another, but rather combinedelements of different categories. For example, a psychotherapeutically helpfulsession for the subject may have been experienced as occurring through the aegisof beings or entities. A mystical or near-death experience may have beenpreceded by encounters with beings. A deeply personal, psychologically catharticsession might have led to mystical or spiritual insights or experiences. PERSONAL SESSIONS Psychological sessions often became psychotherapeutic. It is difficult to bepsychedelicized in the presence of a psychiatrist, which can lead to adiscussion of deeply felt concerns, and not have these concerns at leastreflected back in a way that provides support and possibly further explicationand understanding of the issues at hand. Marsha, an African American fund-raiser for nonprofit organizations, was anexample of someone who underwent a high-dose session that consisted mostly ofpersonal insights, even though its content shared features with being contact.In her case, the issue of concern was her denial of the anger she felt at herhusband’s lack of acceptance of her own deeply ingrained, culturally valued bodyimage. This seemed to be played out in a vision of lifeless though beautifulAnglo dolls that pirouetted mindlessly on a merry-go-round. Cassandra was a young, bisexual woman with interpersonal and psychosomaticfeatures of post-traumatic stress disorder brought on by a neglectful mother anda sexually predatory stepfather. In her sessions, she was able to feel love,warmth, and comfort in parts of her body that had been numb to her for manyyears. She also felt a sense of peace, serenity, and completeness that waswholly unknown to her previously: “Something took my hand and yanked me. Itseemed to say, ‘Let’s go!’ We went through a maze at an incredibly fast pace. Isay we because it seemed like I was being accompanied. . . . They looked likejokers performing for me, [with] funny-looking bells on their hats, big noses.However, I had the feeling they could turn on me, [that they were] a little lessthan completely friendly.” image [images/00009.jpg] image [images/00010.jpg] image [images/00011.jpg] image [images/00012.jpg] image [images/00013.jpg] image [images/00014.jpg] image [images/00015.jpg] image [images/00016.jpg] image [images/00017.jpg] image [images/00018.jpg] As her session progressed, the beings began to effect a healing: “I definitelyfelt the presence of others. They were kind to me, nice and caring. They seemedsmall, as if they could enter my body and mind in that space. There was a totalsense of losing my body, but the little presences knew how to enter it, somehow.I was loved by the entities, or whatever they are. It was pleasant and verycomforting. . . . I feel like I have a new body. It’s so much more aware.” TRANSPERSONAL SESSIONS The transpersonal states brought on by DMT were those most sought after by ourvolunteers and the ones I also hoped would be relatively common and effective,“sticking to the ribs,” psychologically, of our volunteers. We have known forquite some time that psychedelics, either in plant form or in their isolatedstate, can elicit these types of experiences. There are cases from thepsychiatric literature documenting such effects with LSD, psilocybin, and DPT (asynthetic derivative of DMT), and historical and anthropological literature fromthe recent and more distant past is full of reports of such enlighteningexperiences with a wide variety of drugs and plants. Near-death experiences (NDEs) include a sense of rapid movement, often through atunnel, together with music, singing, or voices. There may be a feeling of beingaccompanied by others—living or dead relatives or friends—and a dawningawareness of “being dead.” Also taking place is a life review, the rapidsequential display of more or less highly charged events in an individual’slife. While most people report a great sense of calm and peacefulness, someundergo great terror and fear. Sometimes an NDE climaxes with a mysticalexperience. In all cases, those who have had an NDE describe it as “more realthan real,” and in cases of highly positive NDEs, it is difficult for thesubject to return to this “world of trials” after he or she has just begun totaste the pleasures of the “world of reward.” Mystical experiences are sometimes the culmination of NDEs. Even if suchexperiences do not take place at the actual border of life and death, they mayrequire what feels like a battle to the end with a subject’s own inner demons;the death of a version of the self that depends upon separation rather thancommunity; domination rather than cooperation; an end to the “me-and-mine” wayof relating to existence. At other times, however, less struggle is necessary toattain a mystical state, which may occur by what appears to be a fortuitousdescent of grace. The mystical state relates to extreme alterations in thefundamental components of our experience—namely, time, space, and self. Paradoxabounds: The infinitesimal coexists with the vast without friction or conflict.Likewise, the eternal coexists with the instantaneous and the sense of no selfcoexists with the notion of self containing all of creation. Time no longer passes in its normal manner, but instead seems suspended orsubsumed in an eternity containing past, present, and future. Space is no longerlimited, but at the same time, all existence rests in the smallest possible unitof space. The self can now hold and feel at utter peace with life, good and evilare seen in their deepest reality, and the nature of free will is clearlyperceived. In a mystical experience, individuals are certain of the soul’sexistence without a body and are thus sure of its existence after the body’sdeath. It is known as a certainty that there exists an unimaginably powerfulcreator and sustainer of reality, and of you in particular. This creator isunborn, uncreated, undying, and unchanging. The ecstasy and searing blissaccompanying such experiences, though previously unequaled in intensity, isnevertheless less striking than the peace and equanimity that supports andunderlies this bliss. I was particularly interested in transpersonal experiences being induced by DMTbecause I believed that endogenous NDEs and mystical states were accompanied byor associated with high levels of naturally produced DMT. To the extent that ouradministering exogenous DMT elicited experiences that shared features with thesenaturally occurring states, my hypothesis would be strengthened. Indeed, severalvolunteers had these types of experiences, but generally not as many as perhapswe all had thought likely. Willow, a psychiatric social worker, had many visual effects after her first lowdose of DMT, leading us to believe her high-dose sessions might be profound.They resembled, in many respects, a classical NDE: > First, I saw a tunnel or channel of light off to the right. I had to turn to> go into it. Then the whole process repeated on the left. It was intentional> that way. It was as if it had a source, further away; like a funnel, bright> and pulsating.

I thought I could see light down below, the> world’s light, like a little flap was lifted, like a simultaneous alternate> reality. Several other volunteers had experiences similar or identical to mystical andspiritual states. During her low-dose session, Cleo, a legally blind massagetherapist and counselor, noted “some eyes looking at me, friendly. They wantedto see who was there, and seemed to say that I would follow them later.” Her high doses took her above and beyond, following the eyes: > I had the expectation I would go out, but I went in, into every cell of my> body. It wasn’t just my body . . . themselves . . . themselves . . . it’s all> connected. > When the patterns began, I said to myself, “Let me go through you.” At that> point, it opened, and I was very much someplace else, being, dancing with a> star system. I asked myself, “Why am I doing this to myself?” And there was,> “This is what you’ve always been searching for.

The euphoria goes on into> eternity. And I am part of that eternity. Elena, a psychotherapist who at the time was taking a lengthy sabbatical fromher highly stressful career, reported after her first high dose: > I could only hold on, remembering not to fall off into the distracting light> show. Then, everything stopped! The darkness opened to light, and on the other> side of space, all was utterly still. Then the words “Just because it’s> possible” emerged out of nothingness and filled me.

I wondered, “Why come back?” After her second high dose, she reported: > It came on fast and big, and an incredible pressure arose in my head, pushing> me back.

I didn’t know where or> who I was, but there was nothing to know who or where I was. I didn’t have to> wonder what to do next. There are empty spaces, they were all filled up. Sean, a physician who had not taken any psychedelics for nearly twenty yearsbefore beginning our study, received 0.3 mg/kg DMT every hour, four times, inpreliminary work for the development phase of our tolerance study. After histhird session, he noted: > I noticed five to six figures walking rapidly alongside me. They felt like> helpers, fellow travelers. A humanoid male figure turned toward me, threw his> right arm up towards the patchwork of bright colors, and asked, “How about> this?” The kaleidoscopic patterns immediately became much brighter and moved> more rapidly. A second and then a third asked and did the same thing. At that> point, I decided to go further, deeper. > I immediately saw a bright yellow-white light directly in front of me. I chose> to open to it. I was consumed by it and became a part of it. There were no> distinctions, no figures or lines, shadows or outlines. There was no body or> anything inside or outside. I was devoid of self, of thought, of time, of> space, of a sense of separateness or ego, or of anything but the white light.> There are no symbols in my language that can begin to describe that sense of> pure being, oneness, and ecstasy.

Waves of the light lapped at me as my body receded from> it. I was almost dizzy with happiness as the slide down the ramp finally> ended. INVISIBLE WORLDS Several of the volunteers’ reports contain descriptions of more-or-lesswell-formed visual images made up of kaleidoscopic colors, bright light, andswirling energy. In many sessions, however, novel, strange, or bizarre imageswere noted. Images that fall into this category are those I consider invisibleor unseen. Contact with alien beings falls into a variant of this category. Insome ways, these journeys into invisible realms suggest a world different fromthat which we usually inhabit and perceive. Further, entity or being contactonly adds to the equation by explaining who can be found there. The where of this type of DMT session is not as easy to identify as it is in thepersonal, more psychologically oriented sessions. In this category of DMTexperience, the subject receives intimations of not only internal awareness, butalso the existence of different levels of external reality. These appear to beentirely different worlds or universes, planes of existence that the subject isnow capable of perceiving with the aid of DMT. At least half of our volunteers had these types of experiences in one or theother of their high-dose sessions. Several volunteers perceived a microscopicreality—that is, seeing DNA-like images: “spirals of what looked like DNA, redand green,” “DNA twirling and spiraling . . . gelatin-like, like tubes, insidewhich were cellular activities . . . a microscopic view of them.” Others beheldvisual forms that also contained implicit meaning, but the images perceived werenot typical of the reality that might be revealed by a microscopic lens:“[T]hree-dimensional circles and cones with shading . . . moving a lot . . .almost like an alphabet. A fantasy alphabet, like it was data, not random.” Heather, a midwife, saw this: “. . . a Mexican woman who threw a white blanketover the scene, and then pulled it back repeatedly. There were numbers, likenumerology and language. The numbers became words. Where do words come from? Ilooked around and there were numbers all around. They were separate in theirlittle boxes, and then the boxes would melt and the numbers would all mergetogether to make long numbers.” Eli, an architect-turned–software developer, saw the Logos, the cosmic reasongiving order, purpose, and intelligence to the world, in “the blue-yellow coreof meaning and semantics. . . . When I looked around, it seemed like the meaningor symbols were there, some kind of core of reality where all meaning, the rawbits of reality, are stored. I burst into its main chamber. It is a lot morethan only ones and zeroes. It’s a higher level, very potent bits.” Gabe, a physician, found himself “in a nursery . . . [with] cribs and differentanimals, vibrant. . . . I was in a stroller.” Aaron, a consciousness-enhancement technology entrepreneur, described“hieroglyphics, which turned into a room. There were toys there. It was cute.” Tyrone, a psychiatry trainee, beheld “. . . an apartment from the future. Theplaces to sit, do things, the counters, were molded out of the walls. It wasn’tjust functional, but there was life in the furniture. They were molded out ofsomething alive, an animal, a living being. . . . I went past, beyond theapartments, and entered a space, a crack in the earth . . . a crack in space. In one of his sessions, Aaron also perceived: “. . . a psychedelic,Day-Glo-colored space that approximated a room whose walls and floors had noclear separations or edges, pulsating and throbbing electrically.” Philip, a clinical psychologist, found himself “. . . above a strange landscape,like Earth but very unearthly. I was hovering miles above it. I had the verydistinct sense of doing this, not just the visual perception. There weretelescopes, or microwave dishes, or water towers— things with antennae on them.The sun was different, different colors and hues than our sun.” While it is perhaps a relatively small transition between the strange andunfamiliar where of the high-dose DMT session to the who of the followingdescriptions, this small transition represents a huge conceptual leap. Whereasthe invisible images of the previous examples do not belong to the material ofthis everyday world, they nevertheless seem to be minding their own business,existing on their own, and they can be observed passively. Even when they aremoving, swirling, and glowing, their movement appears to take place withinthings that are inanimate or at least not animate according to our normalconception. In the following descriptions, however, subjects meet with beings, entities, orcreatures that possess awareness, willfulness, and intelligence—sometimes muchgreater than our own. Most startling is their awareness of us. Sometimes theyseem to be expecting us, and other times we seem to have surprised them byappearing in their world. In both cases they know we now are in their space. Attimes their reception is welcoming, but sometimes they greet us with anger andhostility. In some instances, subjects arrive in their “world” by traversinggreat distances through the vacuum of deep space—or they may be with thesebeings in the proverbial blink of an eye, instantly, with no sense of havingtraveled at all. In such instances, these beings seem to appear as opposed tothe subjects arriving in their space. In time spent with them, the beings mayimpart knowledge and healing or pain and suffering. They may give portents orpredictions. Either they want to help or they request help. Karl, a blacksmith and metalworker, beheld “. . . lots of elves, prankish,ornery, maybe four of them along a highway. They commanded the scene; it wastheir terrain. They were about my height and held up placards showing me theseincredibly beautiful, complex, swirling geometric scenes. . . . There was noissue of control; they were totally in control. They wanted me to look.” Aaron transitioned from viewing a beautiful mandala-like image to a situation inwhich: > . . . an insectlike thing got right into my face, hovering over me as the DMT> was going in. This thing sucked me out of my head into outer space . . . a> black sky with millions of stars. I was in a very large waiting room, observed> by the insect-thing and others like it. We were aware of each other. Then they> lost interest. I was taken into space and looked at! > They have an agenda. It’s like walking into a different neighborhood. You’re> not really sure what the culture is. The sense of possibility is so strange. Lucas, an author, experienced the typical buildup of pressure as the effects ofthe high dose of DMT began, and when he “burst out,” he saw > . . . a space station below me, and to my right. Presences were guiding me to> a platform. I was also aware of many entities inside the space> station—automatons, androidlike creatures that looked like a cross between> crash-test dummies and Empire troops for Star Wars, except that they were> living beings, not robots. They had checkerboard patterns on parts of their> bodies, especially their upper arms. They were doing some kind of routine> technological work, and paid little attention to me. Chris, a computer salesman and actor, felt on his second 0.3 mg/kg dose of DMTin the tolerance study: “. . . a set of many hands feeling my eyes and face.They were recognizing and identifying me.” On his third dose: “. . . there werethree beings, three physical forms. There were rays coming out of and then backinto their bodies. They were reptilian and humanoid, trying to make meunderstand not with words, but with gestures. They wanted me to look into theirbodies. I saw inside them and understood reproduction, what it’s like beforebirth, the passage into the body.” Jeremiah, retired from the military, was a newly graduated psychotherapist. Inhis first high-dose session, he found himself “. . . in a nursery—a high-technursery with a single Gumby-like figure,*4 [index_split_016.html#filepos810849]three feet tall attending me. I felt like an infant—not a human infant, but aninfant relative to the intelligences represented by Gumby. It was aware of me,but not particularly concerned. Then I heard two or three male voices talking. Iheard one of them say, ‘He’s arrived.’” During another high-dose session, Jeremiah observed: “. . . one big machine inthe center of a big room, with round conduits, almost writhing—not like a snake,more in a technical manner. The conduits were not open at the end. The machinefelt as if it were reprogramming me. There was a human, as far as I could tell,standing at some type of console. I observed some of the results on thatmachine, maybe from my brain.” In his last session, he described “. . . fourdistinct beings. They had done something and were observing the results. Theyare vastly advanced scientifically and technologically.” Later, Jeremiah reflected on his experiences: > The DMT state shows you something real. It’s totally unexpected, quite> constant and objective. One could interpret your looking at my pupils as being> observed, and the tubes in my body as the tubes I’m seeing. But that is a> metaphor and this is not at all a metaphor. It’s an independent, constant> reality. There is the real possibility of adjacent dimensions. It may not be> so simple as that there are alien planets with their own societies. This is> too proximal. It’s not like some kind of drug. It’s more like the experience> of a new technology. You can choose to attend to this or not. It will continue> to progress without you paying attention. You return not to where you left> off, but to where things have gone since you left. It’s not a hallucination,> but an observation. Dmitri, a Web designer and Heather’s partner, found himself in: > . . . a landing bay, or recovery area. They had a space ready for me. They> weren’t as surprised as I was. It was incredibly nonpsychedelic. I was able to> pay attention to detail. . . . I am so disappointed I didn’t talk with them. I> was confused and in awe. I knew they were preparing me for something. Somehow,> we had a mission. They had things to show me. But they were waiting for me to> acquaint myself with the environment and movement and language of this space.> They were so friendly. I had a bond with one of them. It was about to say> something to me, but we couldn’t quite connect. It was almost a sexual bond .> . . not sex like intercourse, but a total body communication. Their work> definitely had something to do with my presence. Ben, a former military security officer, reported: > There were four to five of them, and they were on me fast. As crazy as this> sounds, they looked like saguaro cactuses, flexible, fluid, geometric, green.> Not solid. They weren’t benevolent, but they weren’t nonbenevolent. They> probed, really probed. They seemed to know time was limited. They wanted to> know what I, this being who had shown up, was doing. I didn’t answer. They> knew. Once they decided I was okay, they went about their business. I felt> like something was inserted into my left forearm, right here, about three> inches below this tattoo on my wrist. It was long. There were no reassurances> with the probe. Simply business. Sean, whose mystical experience we described earlier, also had an encounterduring one of his four 0.3 mg/kg sessions: > I noticed a middle-aged female with a pointed nose and light greenish skin,> sitting off to my right, watching this changing city [whose image had appeared> to him in the preceding few moments]. She had her hand on a dial that seemed> to control the panorama we were watching. She turned slightly toward me and> asked, “What else would you like?” I answered telepathically, “Well, what else> have you got? I have no idea what you can do.” Then she stood up, walked up to> me, touched my right forehead and warmed it up. She then used a sharp object> to open up a panel in my right temple, releasing a tremendous amount of> pressure. This made me feel much better, even though I realized I had felt> fine in the first place. On his first high dose Rex, a journeyman carpenter and singer-songwriter,described: > . . . insect-creatures all around me, trying to break through. I was fighting> letting go of who I am or was. The more I fought, the more demonic they> became, probing into my psyche and my being. I finally starting letting go,> because I was certain I was dying. As I accepted my death and dissolution into> God’s love, the insectoids began feeding on my heart, devouring the feelings> of love and surrender. They were interested in emotion. As I was holding on to> my last thought— that God is love—they asked, “Even here? Even here?” I said,> “Yes. Of course.” They were still there, but I was making love to them at the> same time they were eating me. They feasted as they made love to me. I don’t> know if they were female or male or something else, but it was extremely> alien, though not necessarily unpleasant. The thought came to me with> certainty that they were manipulating my DNA, changing its structure. Then it> started fading. They didn’t want me to go. I didn’t feel stoned or> intoxicated. I was able to observe quite clearly. I had my capacities. It was> just happening. During another session, Rex again struggled with his reaction to the beings’initially sinister presence: > One of them began reassuring me. Then the space opened up around me. There> were creatures and machinery. It looked like it was in a field of black space,> going on forever. They were sharing this with me, letting me see all this.> There was a female who, when I felt I was dying, appeared and reassured me.> She accompanied me during the viewing of the machinery and the creatures. When> I was with her, I had a deep feeling of relaxation and tranquillity. . . . She> had an elongated head. The creatures were pouring communication into me, but> it was just so intense, I couldn’t bear it. There were rays of yellow light> coming out of the face of the reassuring one. She was trying to communicate> with me, and was very concerned for me as to the effects I was experiencing> due to her attempts to communicate. Something green appeared in front of me,> rotating, doing things. She was showing me, it seemed, how to use this thing,> which resembled a computer terminal. I believe she wanted me to try to> communicate with her through that device, but I couldn’t figure it out. Rex’s final session continued with the theme of insectoids in a huge space,which he described as: > . . . an infinite hive. There were insectlike intelligences everywhere, in a> hypertechnological space. I felt wet stuff hitting me all over my body. They> were dripping stuff on me. They wanted me to join them, to stay with them. I> was tempted. I was looking down a corridor that was stretching out forever. I> lost awareness for a moment, then I found myself in that hive. There was> another one helping me—different from the previous helper. It was very> intelligent. It wasn’t at all humanoid. It wasn’t a bee, but it seemed like> one. It was showing me around the hive. It was extremely friendly and I felt a> warm, sensual energy radiating throughout the hive. It said to me [that] this> was where our future lay. Sara was a housewife, mother, and freelance science writer. Her first high-dosesession flung her “backwards through my DNA into a psychedelic buzz saw ofcolors” that she was afraid would consume her. She “reverted to being simply oneenergy form with no body, back in the staging area for life, where souls wait toincarnate.” Despite some anxiety she experienced during this first high dose,Sara returned for the tolerance study, receiving four 0.3 mg/kg doses in themorning, one every thirty minutes. Early on, she saw: > . . . clowns performing. They were like toys or animated clowns. Suddenly, a> pulsating entity appeared out of the patterns of color. It sounds weird to> describe it as Tinkerbell-like, but that is how it looked. It was trying to> coax me to go with it. I was reluctant because I didn’t know about finding my> way back. By the time I had decided to follow it, the drug was wearing off and> I wasn’t high enough to follow the entity. > It followed me back until I sensed it had reached its boundary. I felt like it> was saying good-bye. After some coaching to help her get past the distracting colors, Sara’s thirdand fourth sessions were more focused. During her third, she said she > . . . quickly blasted through to the other side, in a void of darkness.> Suddenly, beings appeared, cloaked, like silhouettes. They were glad to see> me. They indicated they had contact with me as an individual before, and were> pleased we had discovered this [DMT] technology. They wanted to learn more> about our physical bodies, telling me that humans exist at many levels. It> seemed as if they, not the nurse, were collecting blood and heart data, and> appreciated my doing it for them. We had something in common. They told me to> “embrace peace.” With her last dose: > They were ready for me. They told me there were many things they could share> with us when we learn how to make extended contact. Their interest in emotions> and feelings prompted me to say, “We have something we can give you:> spirituality and love.” I felt a tremendous energy, a brilliant pink light> with white edges, building on my left side. They were on my right, so I> reached out my hands across the universe and prepared to be a bridge. I let> this energy pass through me to them. They were grateful, but I was a little> disappointed that my final session was spent giving, when I wanted my own> spiritual enlightenment. I always knew we weren’t alone in the universe, but I> thought the only way to encounter them is with flying saucers in outer space.> It never occurred to me to actually encounter them in our own inner space. I> thought the only things we could encounter inside were things in our own> personal sphere of archetypes and mythology. I expected spirit guides and> angels, not alien life-forms. Oh, and I saw equipment or something . . .> sticks with teardrops coming out of them. It looked like machinery. Not all encounters with beings were ultimately benevolent and gratifying. Forexample, Ken, a full-time student with a great fondness for the emotional warmthof MDMA (Ecstasy), did not have much experience with the more powerful classicalpsychedelics. His first high dose of DMT, thankfully with no rectal temperaturemonitor in place, resulted in finding himself in this situation: “There were twocrocodiles on my chest, crushing me, anally raping me. I didn’t know if I wouldsurvive. At first, I thought I was dreaming, having a nightmare. Then I realizedit was really happening. It was awful. It’s the most scared I’ve ever been in mylife. I wanted to ask to hold your hands, but I was pinned so firmly I couldn’tmove and I couldn’t speak.” Kevin, married to Sara, was a mathematician, whose first high-dose session wasmarked not only by a potentially dangerous rise in his blood pressure, but alsoby an especially frightening encounter: > I felt a tingling in my body, a strange, lifting sensation. I saw colors> coming at me in the darkness. Then I saw a light, a matrix of cells that> looked like skin under a microscope. All of a sudden, off to the upper right,> I saw a figure. She looked like an African war goddess. She was black,> carrying a spear, a shield, and appeared to have a mask on. I surprised her.> She took a defensive and aggressive posture, saying, “YOU DARE TO COME HERE?!”> I mentally replied, “I guess so.” > I felt a tremendous rush in my chest. My heart was hammering. I felt waves> coursing through my body. I thought, “They’ve killed me.” Then my subconscious> or someone said to me, “You’re dying. Don’t die.” Far away I heard what> sounded like an alarm [which was the blood pressure machine reacting to his> high blood pressure with an alarm]. I thought something had gone very wrong. I> thought of Sara and our little son, and I fought. I’m not going to die. I felt> as if I’d dived off a ten-meter platform, hit the water, and was at the bottom> of the pool. I swam for the surface. SIMILARITIES TO ABDUCTION EXPERIENCES These “beyond the veil” experiences share much with alien-abduction literatureas it has been summarized by the late Harvard psychiatrist John Mack in his bookAbduction.1 [index_split_017.html#filepos830555] In a “typical” abductionexperience, a bright light, humming sounds, strange body vibrations, and innertension or paralysis mark the beginning of the occurrence. Then one or morebeings, more or less humanoid, appear, sometimes seeming to emerge from thebackground. Some abductees find themselves in a parallel world that has ordinaryor familiar features, such as a room or a park. Others find themselves in anexamining, treatment, or laboratory setting. In all cases, the individuals areabsolutely under the control of the beings in a situation that they consistentlydescribe as more real than real. Beings are busily moving around, attending to tasks the subjects do notunderstand. Some abductees feel some type of neuropsychological reprogramming ora transfer of information involving unusual visual symbols, rather than words orsounds. The beings may gaze very closely at abductees. On other occasions, theabductees report probes being inserted into their bodies. They may feel theirpsyche has been transformed. The beings appear to be greatly interested in ourphysicality and emotionality. They seem to need something that only human lovecan provide. Commonly, the initial contact is cold and indifferent. One entityin particular is more or less in charge, and the abductee seems to have aspecial relationship with this being. Some abductees report being greeted byaliens upon emerging into their reality, a type of “welcome back!” reaction. There are striking commonalities between the reports of Mack’s subjects andthose of our DMT volunteers. It is tempting to speculate that there is arelationship between the two sets of observations. Perhaps elevations inendogenous DMT levels occurred in those individuals who claim that theyexperienced an alien abduction. Supporting this theory is the fact that many ofMack’s volunteers were under tremendous stress before their abductionexperiences, and we know that in nonhumans, DMT levels in the brain rise inresponse to stress. Yet none of our subjects had any visible evidence of having made contact with“real” beings—even the volunteer who claimed that aliens implanted a rod intohis forearm. In this case, it may be worthwhile to consider a spectrum ofencounter phenomena along an axis that has at its two extremes physicality andnoncorporeality. At one pole, purely consciousness-to-consciousness contact ismade, and objective physical data resulting from an encounter are not necessaryto establish the veracity of contact. MODELS FOR UNDERSTANDING THE DMT EXPERIENCE The vast range of DMT effects seen in our volunteers makes it difficult toformulate any single explanatory model. Putting aside for the moment thequestion of how any drug or plant modifies consciousness, we may conceptualizethe effects of DMT along a trajectory of explanations, from the very likely tothe very speculative. With respect to the psychotherapeutic effects seen in thepersonal category of DMT sessions, it is relatively easy to postulate effects onsome of the mental processes involved in psychotherapy of any kind:enhancements, reductions, or novel effects on projection, suggestibility,transference, repression, denial, and the like. DMT also may modify imagination,creativity, and symbolization of conflicts in order to allow an individual moreflexibility in dealing with painful feelings and memories. In terms of transpersonal experiences, there are several levels of explanationsfrom which to choose. There exists a growing field of neurotheology that positsthat particular brain centers mediate such states. While these studies havedetermined the anatomical location of such changes, they have not identifiedtheir proximate cause. Any involvement of DMT would add an important element tothis equation. Psychological counterparts to these brain changes, particularly those within aclinical psychological framework, have not been particularly well articulated.The fields of cognitive psychology, which borrows heavily from computer science,and transpersonal psychology, which borrows heavily from religious studies, havemade the best attempts at framing these experiences in the language ofpsychology. Yet the otherworldly, invisible experiences at both the microscopicand macroscopic levels—particularly those in which there is contact withbeings—push us onto rather thin conceptual ice, but we must make the effort tounderstand them. My primary reaction to such reports by my initial nineteen DMT informants andthen to reports from our own research volunteers was “This is your brain onDMT.” In other words, I assumed we were dealing only with brain chemistrychanges. It is difficult, however, to conceive of one chemical’s effects on somany different psychological functions over an extended period oftime—especially because it elicits a seemingly seamless synthesis of suchcomplex and novel content. This hypothesis failed to appeal to either my or thevolunteers’ scientific intuition—that is, intuition that emerges out of ascientific worldview. Similarly, psychological explanations alone did not seem likely to account forthese experiences, although devotees of Freudian and Jungian deconstruction ofsymbols, images, feelings, and thoughts could most likely build coherentexplanations. Nevertheless, volunteers (and, ultimately, I) rejected aninsistence on the symbolic, dreamlike foundation of the subjects’ experiences.Clearly and unequivocally, the volunteers were able to distinguish betweenexperiences on DMT and those of a dream. What’s more, it was extraordinarilydifficult, if not impossible, for this rather psychologically andpsychotherapeutically sophisticated group of volunteers to believe thatunconscious mental contents and processes could be at the root of these types ofsessions. Further, more philosophically, such an approach led to aninterpretation of these experiences as something other than what they seemed tobe. To paraphrase Jeremiah, “This is not a metaphor.” The only explanatory modelthat held itself out as the most intuitively satisfying, yet the mosttheoretically treacherous, involved assigning a parallel level of reality tothese experiences. In other words, I engaged in a thought experiment forced uponme by the insistence of the volunteers and the consistency of their reports: Ihad to accept their reports as descriptions of things that were “real.” Iallowed myself, at least theoretically, to accept that under the influence ofDMT, these things do happen—in reality, although not in a reality we usuallyinhabit. What were the results of this thought experiment? One result is that it helpedlessen my own uncertainty about navigating this uncharted territory. A moreopen-minded, less interpretive approach also led to greater comfort on the partof volunteers, and, subsequently, they more readily disclosed some of theirunusual experiences. Yet this experiment also strained my scientific worldviewand went far beyond any scientific training I had brought to bear on thisresearch. If such an assumption was true, and even if it was not, it is worthconsidering where, within contemporary science, we might find support for such atheory—not that contemporary science is the only model. Shamanic traditions,from which grew our own religious traditions, assume multiple levels ofco-occurring reality that we can enter and perceive while in an altered state ofconsciousness. For the moment, let us hypothesize an effect of DMT on the receivingcharacteristics of consciousness occurring through changes in thephysical-chemical-energetic properties of the brain. This is comparable to theeffects of X-rays, telescopes, or microscopes on our everyday perceptualapparatus. The things we see with the aid of a microscope, for example, areutterly alien, but because they are perceived in a state within which most of usexist most of the time, we can validate them consensually. In the case of a microscope, however, we are dealing with an extension of oursenses via hardware. In the DMT scenario, the wetware of the brain is modified,leading to the opening of other realms. These data are harder to validatebecause, at this point, they are very difficult to share in the same way astraditional data. Within our model of science, however, it appears that thenascent fields of parallel universes, dark matter, and other highly abstractscientific pursuits are those in which we might find ways to explain some ofwhat our DMT volunteers described. These fields are highly theoretical and, forthe most part, exist only within the minds of the scientists working on theirexplication. We ought not lose sight of the analogous nature of these two setsof data, both relating to thought experiments. FUTURE STUDIES Several relatively simple studies could follow from this first phase of ourhuman DMT research. One project could measure levels of endogenous DMT in peoplewho have naturally occurring experiences with DMT-like features. These levelscould then be compared to those from people in ordinary, waking consciousness.States of interest would include mystical ones, near-death experiences, alienabduction, psychotic episodes, and dream sleep (perhaps REM phase). Anotherseries of studies might involve administering DMT to people who have had any ofthese experiences, and comparing the effects that occur under the influence ofDMT to those that occur naturally. For example, such a study might discoverwhether administering DMT to someone claiming to be an abductee would elicit allor part of an alien abduction experience. It is most important that we gain more familiarity with the DMT state,particularly over a longer time period, in order to establish a consensuallyvalidated topography. Ayahuasca sessions last four to six hours, and we canlearn much about DMT worlds through careful examination and collation of reportsinvolving this DMT-containing preparation. In addition, a longer-term infusionof DMT, perhaps over several hours, would provide less-chaotic access to thesedimensions and generate valuable information on the effects of pure DMT itself,rather than DMT combined with beta-carbolines, as in ayahuasca. DISCUSSION OF THE RESULTS OF DMT STUDY No matter how we explain the phenomena of the DMT experience using the tools ofNewtonian or quantum mechanisms, the very existence of the DMT experiencechanges an individual’s worldview by highlighting how we habitually limit ourdiscourse to what is usually perceived. The fact that a substance such asDMT—residing within our own bodies and regulated by a physical gene—can propelus into seemingly freestanding inhabited worlds requires further examination. Insome ways, the discovery, acknowledgment, and discussion of these states iscomparable to the discovery, acknowledgment, and discussion of the unconscious.DMT and similar drugs provide reliable access to realms that are almost alwaysimperceptible but under the influence of the drug are experienced as real ormore real than the normal waking state. Dreams, and religious and near-death experiences are altered states ofconsciousness that have had tremendous impact upon humans, both individually andcollectively. Dreams, however, can be capricious and chaotic, and religious andnear-death states occur to us only rarely, if at all. DMT-induced altered statesof consciousness are easily accessible, and during them, we maintain relativelyintact powers of observation, whereas after them, much of the experience isretained. Perhaps we may tap this awesomely vast reservoir of experiences usingDMT. If it turns out that endogenous DMT is associated with naturally occurring,highly valued states, we can more readily accept these DMT-induced states as“natural” or “biological”—perhaps even our birthright. DMT AS THE ENDOMATRIX The endogenicity of DMT, however, is not the only property that we must ponder.We must also consider its active transport into the brain across the normallyimpenetrable blood–brain barrier. DMT may be a necessary constituent of thebrain’s nutritional requirements. What does this suggest about this substance’srole in the normal waking state? One possible answer is that DMT mediateseveryday waking consciousness. In addition to its intensity and strangeness, theDMT state is perceptible—that is, most of the time, while under the influence ofthe drug, there is something of which we are aware. In other words, in both theDMT and normal waking states, the consciousness-awareness element functionsnormally. Time generally seems to exist, as do the basic building blocks ofvisual, auditory, emotional, and other categories of mental experience. If weconsider that we are now, all of us, for this moment experiencing a DMT trip(remember, there is no tolerance to DMT—its effects can be experiencedcontinuously), how are we to relate to where we are now? Will we act and feelabout things any differently? What about questions of life, self, and other?What of questions of God, free will, and good and evil?*5[index_split_016.html#filepos811076] Closer to home, in relation to the particular theme of this book, the presenceof DMT may suggest a previously unappreciated fluidity, permeability, orplasticity of the membrane separating us and other worlds. This barrier, then,may exist more inside of us than outside of us—in inner rather than outer space.Therefore, travel across great distances in outer space may not be the only wayto reach worlds that are different from our own, seemingly remote in time andspace. Moreover, it may be unnecessary to restrict this search using methodsbased upon a view of reality limited to what is physical and measurable. It isperhaps this one-sided vantage point that has removed us from potentiallyunlimited nonphysical realities. We can challenge this limitationintellectually, scientifically, spiritually, and, most important, practically.Establishing—with a sober, altruistic intent—reliable and generally availablemeans of contact with these different levels of existence may help us alleviatesome of the pressing issues we are facing on this planet in this time–spacecontinuum. It even may be that the information and resources we gather in thesenoncorporeal realms are more important to our survival—and ultimately ourevolution—than that which we obtain via strictly physical means. image [images/00003.jpg] DMT is a psychedelic substance found with great consistency within many livingcreatures, from psychoactive plants to the human body. Though we can describeits chemistry and pharmacology using the traditional tools and language ofscience, the subjective experiences of DMT are more difficult to place into aconceptual framework. Furthermore, its endogenicity and special but unknown rolein normal brain function suggest that DMT exerts an impact on both extraordinarystates of awareness during our lives and our fundamental perception of theselives.

Of these plants, P. viridis is probably best known inthe West, because much of contemporary knowledge of ayahuasca derives fromeither the Peruvian mestizo tradition or the Brazilian religious organizationsthat use the preparation as a sacrament. (Both use Psychotria viridis as thevisionary additive.) Banisteriopsis caapi contains harmine and tetrahydroharmineas its primary active alkaloids, with smaller amounts of harmaline and othercompounds, whose major function is to allow the orally ingested DMT to attainpsychoactive levels in the brain. Ayahuasca, the name given both to the vine andto the final preparation, has been the subject of an increasing number ofpopular and scientific publications, documentaries, conferences, and seminars. I first learned about ayahuasca in 1971, when I met Terence McKenna travelingwith Erica Nietfeld in my native town of Florencia, the capital of Caquetá, inthe Colombian Amazon. I was twenty-four and almost finished with my studies inSpanish and Latin American philology and literature at Madrid University aftertwo and a half years of philosophy and theology studies with the PiaristFathers, a religious order. I was visiting my family after an absence of sevenyears from Colombia. Terence was twenty-five. I spoke enough English tocommunicate with him, and he told me of his and his brother Dennis’s experienceswith yagé (ayahuasca) and the mushroom Psilocybe cubensis some months earlier atLa Chorrera, a small settlement with an impressive waterfall by the PutumayoRiver, some two hundred fifty kilometers southeast of where we were. They had reached it after a long journey up the river from Puerto Leguzamo. Iwas amazed by Terence’s story and the breadth of his knowledge. Terence andErica planned to leave for Bogotá, the capital of Colombia, the next day, ontheir way to the Peruvian Amazon in pursuit of yagé. Excited, I went home andtold my father about my encounter. He had never taken the brew, but knew thatthe Coreguaje and other indigenous groups of the area used it. He said: “Tellyour friends they do not need to go to Peru to look for yagé. They will find itright here.” He also told me that it was used for divination by don ApolinarYacanamijoy, an Ingano Indian I knew since I was a child, because he used to gowith his family to my grandmother’s granero, a small general store. My father told me that I could invite them to stay in Villa Gloria, a woodenhouse and land we owned some twenty kilometers from Florencia. The three of usmoved in, and Erica spent several hours a day typing the manuscript of what cameto be The Invisible Landscape.1 [index_split_017.html#filepos830898] They weretraveling with a short library of interesting books. Terence and I read duringthe day or made short excursions into the surrounding pasture, looking forpictographs that were rumored to exist in the area and for mushrooms, none ofwhich we found. After sunset, and with only candles and flashlights to help usthrough the dark, we talked about strange ideas associated with the use ofhallucinogenic plants, including time travel, mind reading, and contact withother dimensions. A few times during the following two months, we boarded an old truck thatbrought to Florencia—at least an hour’s journey—passengers from several smallvillages populated by recent colonists. The best restaurant in town in thosedays belonged to Ernst, a one-eyed German Rosicrucian who knew don Apolinar andwho used to live with the Tukano Indians of the Colombian Vaupés River. There helearned about yagé (which they called caapi) and about borrachero, thevernacular name given to several species of the genus Brugmansia, all of whichcontain powerful atropine alkaloids. Ernst introduced us to Carlos, whose real name was Karman, a Hungarian ex–soccerplayer who had deserted his Italian team in Venezuela when he fell in love witha Venezuelan woman who subsequently left him after spending all his money.Stranded in South America, he went to the Amazon, where he spent some time withvarious indigenous groups. He made ends meet by repairing typewriters. Ernstsold us a small bottle of yagé, which he had received from don Apolinar. Thefour of us took it that night in Villa Gloria. Karman reported seeing beautiful,naked women, and then he kept silent. Neither Terence nor Erica saw anything,but both vomited profusely and had diarrhea. I had visions of a city with tall,organic towers with birds flying around them and populated by long whitehumanoids. I also saw what I thought was a DNA molecule. Don Apolinar was an Ingano who lived in Yurayaku, then a tiny settlement.Inganos are a Quechua-speaking indigenous group that live in southeasternColombia. He had moved with his family from the Mocoa area, in the Putumayo, toCaquetá. Many years later I learned that he was regarded as a great shaman bynatives of that area. From time to time, he used to go to a certain smallpension in Florencia, and I went there occasionally to inquire about him. Ifinally met him at the end of my stay in Colombia. He told me, “If you are interested in yagé, you would have to keep a six-monthdiet. At the end yagé will come to see what you want.” “How is yagé?” I asked. “Simptico,” he said. After I finished my studies in Madrid, I moved to Norway, where I taught Spanishand Latin American literature at Oslo University for the next seven years. Atthe same time, I continued my own education, taking courses in variousdisciplines that I thought would help me to integrate and illuminate myexperience with yagé. In the summer of 1973, I flew to Berkeley and spent twomonths with Terence and Erica, strolling up and down Telegraph Avenue and buyingsecondhand books during the day. In the evenings there were always interestingvisitors in the house, often writers, scientists of various disciplines, orseekers of various kinds. There were only a few publications about yagéavailable at that time, and the best known of these was The Yagé Letters,2[index_split_017.html#filepos831153] a book composed by William Burroughs(1914–1997) and consisting of travel notes and letters to Allen Ginsberg(1926–1997) written during his seven-month expedition in search of yagé. Thebook also contains Ginsberg’s own accounts of his experiences with ayahuasca inthe Peruvian Amazon in 1960. According to Ralph Metzner,3[index_split_017.html#filepos831385] the shamanic lore of ayahuasca enteredWestern culture most strongly and initially through The Yage Letters, which hasbeen republished recently with an excellent introduction by Oliver Harris. In 1965, Peter Matthiessen, in his novel At Play in the Fields of the Lord,4[index_split_017.html#filepos831608] told the story of a Cheyenne who takesayahuasca, flies his airplane until its fuel is exhausted, and parachutes intothe midst of an Indian community, where he becomes one of its members. The book,which shows the conflicts involving missionaries, the army protecting theinterest of colonists, and an Indian community that is finally obliterated,appeared on the big screen with the same title in 1991 under the direction ofHéctor Babenco. In 1971, a landmark in Amazonian studies appeared, AmazonianCosmos: The Sexual and Religious Symbolism of the Tukano Indians.5[index_split_017.html#filepos831819] It was written by GerardoReichel-Dolmatoff, an Austrian-Colombian ethnologist and archaeologist, whorealized the crucial importance of caapi in the cultural life of this tribe. Thenext year brought Peter Furst’s anthology Flesh of the Gods,6[index_split_017.html#filepos832088] which demonstrated the existence of seriousscholarship focusing on the use of sacred plants in various cultures. In 1973,there appeared Hallucinogens and Shamanism,7[index_split_017.html#filepos832309]an anthology edited by Michael Harner, withseveral articles dealing with ayahuasca in the indigenous context. In January 1979, I moved to Helsinki, where I became Spanish lecturer at theSwedish School of Economics. It was then that I decided it was time to revisitmy home continent. In the summer of that year, I made a journey from BuenosAires to Valparaiso, in Chile, up to Antofagasta, then on to La Paz, Cuzco,Lima, and Bogotá before arriving in Florencia to visit my parents for a few daysbefore returning to Finland. Naturally, yagé was on my mind. I invited mybrother Alvaro to come with me to Yurayaku, where don Apolinar lived. Sevenyears earlier, my brother visited him briefly, walking to his home through amuddy trocha, a narrow passage through the forest, for some twelve hours fromthe small town of San José de la Fragua. Now, however, it was possible to takethe bus all the way to the new settlement that had been built about half an hourwalk away from his home, which was located at the other side of the FragüitaRiver. Don Apolinar had aged considerably since the last time I saw him; he must havebeen about eighty years old or older. He was tired and bitter, because thecolonists had destroyed his fields of medicinal plants, including hisplantations of several kinds of yagé. He was reluctant to give my brother and meyagé that night, which was my only opportunity to acquire it, for I had toreturn to Europe shortly. We were disappointed, but we had little to offer donApolinar for the great favor we were asking, so we went for a walk with donRoberto, his son, through the pastures surrounding Yurayaku. The land was grazedby humped Indian Cebu cows and was dotted with Psilocybe cubensis mushrooms,which grew on the cows’ dung. I asked Roberto whether he or the others ever atethem. “We do not, because it does not go well with yagé, but the gringos eat them assoon as they spot them,” he said. I proposed to my brother that we have a mushroom experience. Don Roberto blessedfour large ones solemnly, and my brother and I had two each. A distinctive landmark in that area was a huge rock, and from the effects of themushrooms I thought that if Indians had been living in the area in the past, therock must have been a sacred site. It was completely covered by moss, but as mybrother and I started to peel off some of the growth, we found traces ofpetroglyphs. “These were made by the old ones,” said don Apolinar, who also told us that whenhe first arrived there years ago, a huge rubber tree was growing on top of therock. After he had cut its roots and set it on fire, reducing it to ashes, hediscovered the petroglyphs. I again implored don Apolinar to give us yagé. “I have been waiting for this forthe last seven years,” I said. Finally, he said: “But we do not have batteries for our torches and no candles.” “We will go to buy some,” I quickly replied. A heavy rain had been falling for the last few hours. Still under the effects ofthe mushrooms, my brother and I made a run to one of the shops and purchasedsome batteries, candles, and a bottle of aguardiente, a distilled sugarcanedrink spiced with anise of which don Apolinar was fond. It was beginning to getdark, and once again, we had to cross the perilous hanging wooden bridge acrossthe Fragüita River to reach don Apolinar’s house. While crossing the bridge, Ilooked down and saw what seemed to be a huge serpent coming down the rivertoward us. At first I thought it was a hallucination, for I was still feelingthe effects of the mushrooms, but then, as it came closer, I saw that my brotherbehind me on the bridge was also looking in amazement at the serpent, which wasprobably caught in the rain and trying to get to shore. It was dark by now. Don Apolinar drank the bottle of aguardiente in a few gulps.He was now wearing his crown of feathers, a jaguar-tooth collar, and a Catholicmedal around his neck. Don Roberto was also there, wearing a smaller crown. Hegave us a small cup of the bitter drink, prepared as a cold infusion of thepounded stem of B. caapi and the leaves of chagropanga (Diplopterys cabrerana).We were told to lie down on cow skins on the floor. I waited for the effects tocome. At some point, I was distracted by the stars above and forgot where Iwas—then I suddenly realized that I was inside don Apolinar’s house, looking atthe sky through the roof. I shuddered in fear and amazement. The image of theserpent in the river came to my mind and I started to crawl like a snake andthought about the frogs croaking out in the rain. A burst of vomit came too fastto control, and my brother helped me out to the veranda, where I promptly threwup. The night was filled with stars and fireflies that formed a continuous,pulsating, magical background. I returned to the house in awe. “Don Apolinar,” I said. “You know so much!” “It is not me,” he said. “It is yagé.” The next morning I felt wonderful and took pictures of don Apolinar and hisfamily. Natividad, don Roberto’s wife, had also taken yagé the night before. Iasked her what she saw. “Culebras [snakes],” she said. My brother and I returnedto Florencia, and I flew back to Bogotá and then on to Helsinki a couple of dayslater, even more convinced that I had been sorely lacking in my knowledge of theindigenous population of my own region. Back home in Helsinki, I learned of the work of Rafael Karsten, aSwedish-Finnish ethnologist who, in the early 1930s, had exactly the job I had:a Spanish lectureship at the Swedish School of Economics. Karsten (1879–1956)made several expeditions to South America between 1911 and 1929, and in the1920s and 1930s he published several ethnographic books, one of them a massivevolume describing his travels among the Shuar (Jívaro), including informationabout their material culture, social life, religion, and art. Karsten witnessedseveral collective natém (ayahuasca) rituals among the Shuar as well as moreprivate shamanic ceremonies. In 1920, he published the first detaileddescription of the religious ideas connected with natém’s use. When Karstenasked the Shuar why they drink natém, he received the following answer: “It isin order that the people may not die away.” He then adds the followingcommentary: > By this kind of divination they try to find out what dangers are threatening> the family, whether enemies are planning an attack against them, whether evil> sorcerers are operating against them, whether they will be successful in their> own undertakings, and so forth. The magical drink . . . purifies the stomach> from harmful substances and the magic arrows of wizards. . . . At the same> time both men and women are, by drinking natéma, made strong and clever for> their different occupations and duties, the men for hunting, fishing, war,> etc., the latter for agriculture, for the education of the children, for the> care of the domestic animals, and for other domestic work incumbent on them.8> [index_split_017.html#filepos832525] I also learned about the work of the American anthropologist Irving Goldman(1911–2002), who documented his 1939–1940 fieldwork on mihí (a B. caapi drink)rituals among the Cubeo of Colombia. Goldman points out that this culture valuesinebriation as something sacred. Mihí is intimately connected to ancestor cultsand is used in drinking parties together with tobacco juice, manioc beer, andcoca chewing, the backbone of the Cubeo social life, as well as in “moaningfestivals,” which produce as their final outcome transformation of anger andgrief into joy. Neither Karsten nor Goldman took ayahuasca. Reichel-Dolmatoff,however, did. In The Shaman and the Jaguar,9[index_split_017.html#filepos832800] he recounts in amazing detail a Barasanaceremony in which he participated, tape recording his experiences. The nextmorning, he recounts: > I was drawing in my notebook, trying to recapture some of the images I had> seen. A man who was looking over my shoulder when I was making a series of> dotted lines, vertical but slightly undulating, asked a question about it, and> I answered that I had seen this design last night. > “Look!” he called to the others. Several people came and gathered around me,> staring at my drawing. > “What does this image mean?” I asked. > The men laughed. “It’s the Milky Way,” they said; “You saw the Milky Way! You> were flying up with us to the Milky Way!” Perhaps the first anthropologist to have reported his own experience withayahuasca was Michel Harner, who partook of a session among the Conibo in 1960(see chapter 9). His experience set Harner in the direction of creating aninstitution dedicated to the revitalization of traditional shamanism and itsintroduction to the Western world using the drum as a tool to access otherrealms. VEGETALISMO My experience with don Apolinar was always on my mind. I conceived a project inwhich I would make a film about three generations: don Apolinar and his wife,who walked barefoot, their toes spread like fingers; don Roberto, don Apolinar’sson, and his wife Natividad, who wore sandals; and don Apolinar’s grandchildren,proud of their tennis shoes. I began preparations, together with Gregory Moore,an American living in Helsinki, who told me he had experience as a cameraman. Weborrowed equipment and gathered enough money to buy tapes and one and a halfhours of 16 mm film. One month before the planned departure to visit donApolinar, my father wrote me that the don had died, but I was determined to makea short documentary on yagé. Greg and I went to Los Angeles to see JorgePreloran, a well-known Argentinian filmmaker who had made remarkableanthropological films using very simple equipment. “What equipment do you have?” he asked. “A 16 mm Bolex and a Sony recorder. No connection between them.” “Great,” he said. “I made more than forty films with equipment like that.” Preloran advised me to choose a person as a subject for the film. He alsosuggested that every evening I record, with the same volume, the subject’s ideasabout himself and the world. The next day, I was to transcribe what was recordedthe night before and study the manuscript carefully, looking for a narrativethread. Then I was to shoot the pictures that would go with the narrative. Iwent to see Terence McKenna, who had moved to Sebastopol, near San Francisco,with his wife, Kat Harrison. He told me that recently he visited Iquitos, then acity of about three hundred thousand on the shores of the Amazon River in Peru.He said there was an ayahuasquero tradition there worth looking into, so Idecided to go. He gave me the names of three ayahuasqueros he had heard of.Gregory went to Iquitos a couple of days ahead of me, and following Terence’sdirections, he met the ayahuasquero don Emilio Andrade Gómez. When looking for aplace to stay, Gregory had been offered the very same room where Bruce Lamb hadwritten Wizard of the Upper Amazon,10 [index_split_017.html#filepos833081] thestory of Manuel Córdoba Ríos, a famous ayahuasquero in Iquitos who claimed thathe had been kidnapped by Amahuaca Indians, who taught him about ayahuasca andother medicinal plants, which enabled him to become a shaman. This was one ofthe first English-language books that contributed to the spread of informationabout ayahuasca. From the moment I saw don Emilio, I knew I had found the person I was lookingfor: he was humble and eloquent, had a great sense of humor, and knew the forestwhere he had lived all his life. He was then sixty-three years old and livedwith his wife and his youngest son twelve kilometers from Iquitos along a roadthat was still under construction at that time and would eventually join Iquitosand Nauta in the south, on the shores of the Marñóan River. He called himself avegetalista, a term used to denote a specialist in the use of certain powerfulvegetales (plants), of which there are several kinds. Don Emilio was anayahuasquero, but I learned that there were also tabaqueros, toeros,camalongueros, and perfumeros, who used tobacco (toé; Brugmansia sp.), camalonga(Strychnos sp.), and the perfume derived from various powerful plants,respectively. Don Emilio had taken ayahuasca for the first time when he wasfourteen years old in order to “get stronger,” but ayahuasca “loved him,” and inhis visions and dreams it taught him icaros, or magical songs, until he finallybecame an ayahuasquero. I followed Preloran’s advice word for word. Every night I spent several hourswith don Emilio, recording his words. The next day I transcribed what I hadrecorded the night before—and I soon realized that I had in my hands much morethan a film. To me, it was about the discovery of vegetalismo, a Peruvianshamanic tradition of imprecise origin that I later learned had been partiallydocumented by Castillo, Dobkin de Rios, Ayala and Lewis, Chiappe, and Lamb11[index_split_017.html#filepos833332] and was one of the variants of nontribalayahuasca use found in the Amazonian regions of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, andeastern Brazil. According to don Emilio, ayahuasca was un doctor, a plantteacher, one among many others, some of which were cooked together whenpreparing the brew or were used independently in various ways. All these plantshave a spirit who, under certain circumstances, gives information to the personwho ingests them. Before ingestion there is required a particular diet thatincludes not only food restrictions but also sexual segregation. The spirits ofthe plants taught icaros, songs used for curing, for protection, and for othertasks such as increasing or diminishing the strength of visions during asession. I collected plants, which I later sent to Timothy Plowman, at the Chicago FieldMuseum of Natural History, for identification; participated in ayahuascasessions with don Emilio and other mestizo practitioners; recorded songs; andgathered information about this cultural tradition that was apparently bornduring the so-called rubber boom period (1880–1914). During that time,indigenous populations were forcefully displaced, and a mestizo syncretic riverculture emerged that blended Amazonian and Andean cultural elements and Westernideas. For example, instead of power animals and helping spirits typical oftraditional shamanism, mestizo practitioners relied on the supernatural help ofangels with swords, soldiers armed with guns, and even warplanes fitted withmodern weaponry. Don Emilio told me that under the effects of ayahuasca, he wasable to diagnose illness with the help of his doctores, spirits from nature andalso those that came from distant countries. Sometimes, he said he had beentaken to strange places where he saw beings using all sorts of advancedmachines. I recorded about thirty hours of interviews with don Emilio and otherayahuasqueros. The transcriptions yielded a manuscript that was not only thebase of the narrative for the 1982 film Don Emilio and His Little Doctors, butalso the beginning of my doctoral dissertation under the direction of ÅkeHultkrantz, a specialist in shamanism and the head of the Institute ofComparative Religion at Stockholm University. Stockholm was relatively close toHelsinki, and I could buy an inexpensive ticket on board one of the large boatsthat connected the two cities, a sixteen-hour journey. In the summer of 1982, I went back to Iquitos, where I took ayahuasca andinterviewed several other practitioners. Don Emilio introduced me to don JoséCoral, who he said was a good ayahuasquero and could be my teacher. I wasparticularly intrigued by the learning process. I arranged for don Emilio’s sonJorge, who was twenty-one years old and who lived with him, and Alirio, aneighbor who was twenty-two, to move with me into the house of don José Coral,near Peña Negra, about twenty-five kilometers from Iquitos, where José livedwith his wife. He had a few animals and cultivated mostly maize and manioc. Theidea was to keep the prescribed diet, which in this area consists of plantains,rice or manioc without salt, and at times a little fish, and also includessexual abstinence and the taking of ayahuasca. I would record the process onfilm. Don José had two patients in his home when we arrived, Señora Rosa, whohad a bad rheumatic ailment in her knees, and Señora Dominga, who had a terriblecancerous infection near her mouth. I was able to follow the healing procedures,learning at the same time the local ideas about health and illness. Don Joséused a combination of medicinal plants, massage, dream interpretation, and ofcourse ayahuasca sessions in which he sang icaros, songs taught him by thespirits that came “from the end of the world.” A few days after starting the diet, Alirio could not stand eating without saltand broke the regimen. Jorge followed it for eighteen days. I found myself to bethe only one interested in keeping the diet—and I could not make a film aboutmyself. The process was very interesting, however. Ingesting little food andfollowing the dietary prescriptions kept me in an altered state of consciousnessnearly all the time; for me, the difference between being awake and dreaming wasnot very clear. I often had what Stephen LaBerge later called luciddreaming—that is, dreaming while being conscious of doing so, a phenomenon hewas able to verify scientifically by means of signaling agreed-upon eyemovements during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep from the dreamer’s mind to theoutside world. “You see, you are learning,” was don José’s comment on this. For one month I stayed with don José and his patients. Señora Rosa recoveredfully. “Contenta me voy” (I go home happy), was her final comment when she left.Señora Dominga died some weeks after I headed back to Iquitos. “She was broughtto me too late,” don José said to me. In Iquitos I stayed in the home of GuntherSchaper, an older German engineer who had lived for over fifty years in thePeruvian Amazon. In the 1930s he had sent several kilograms of Banisteriopsiscaapi to Merck Laboratories in Germany as a possible treatment for Parkinson’sdisease. Mr. Schaper lived only two hundred meters from the Plaza de Armas, themain square. His house was surrounded by a small botanical garden, the greenestblock in the center of town. He had several rooms that he rented to botanists,anthropologists, and explorers; it was the best place to meet the mostfascinating people visiting Iquitos. There, I wrote my first two papers aboutmestizo ayahuasca shamanism. These were proofread by Nicole Maxwell, an Americanwoman who had spent many years in the Amazon collecting plants, and who was theauthor of Witch-doctor’s Apprentice,12 [index_split_017.html#filepos834338] aninteresting book I had acquired some months earlier in Stockholm. I sent the manuscripts to Richard Evans Schultes (1915–2001), head of theBotanical Museum of Harvard University and the world authority on the botany ofhallucinogenic plants. Several months later, he wrote me a letter in Spanishtelling me that he had sent my papers to Laurent Rivier, editor of the Journalof Ethnopharmacology and an ayahuasca researcher, for publication. Schulteswrote: “I think that in the year 1941, I met in Puerto Ass a relative of yours,an old man whose surname was Luna, who helped me greatly when I was a noviceexplorer of the Putumayo region. Was not Pedro Luna a relative of yours? Andwhat a surprise to find in Helsinki and in a Scandinavian language a citizen ofour ‘Caquetá!’” My father told me that Pedro Luna had been my great-uncle. PHARMACOLOGY OF AYAHUASCA In 1984, I was invited to a symposium on shamanism in Vancouver, BritishColumbia, Canada, and used the occasion to visit Dennis McKenna, who was makinga comparative study of the activity of ayahuasca and Virola snuffs for hisdoctoral dissertation in the department of botany at the University of BritishColumbia. The resin from several species of Virola, usually large trees, wasused by indigenous groups of the Upper Amazon to make DMT-containing snuffs touse ceremonially. Snuffs made of yet another genus, Anadenanthera, alsocontaining tryptamines, were used in South America and the Caribbean. In thenorthern part of South America, indigenous tribes used A. peregrina, and in thesouth, tribes used A. colubrina, together covering a huge area.13[index_split_017.html#filepos834591] If we add the many species of psilocybinmushrooms used in Mesoamerica, we find in the Americas a remarkableconcentration of tryptamines, like nowhere else in the world. Dennis McKenna was excited to confirm experimentally that harmine is indeed amonoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), as proposed by the prominent toxicologist BoHolmstedt (1918–2002) of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, which explainsthe oral activity of DMT in the ayahuasca brew. DMT taken by itself is inactiveorally, because it is destroyed in the gut and liver by monoamine oxidase (MAO)enzymes. When taken together with an MAOI, however, it is protected and is thusable to cross the blood–brain barrier and act on serotonin receptor sites. Thisis an amazing discovery by Amazonian Indians. Years later, I met the American pharmacologist Jace Callaway in Finland, whocompleted his doctoral dissertation for Kuopio University on pinoline, which, asits name indicates, is a compound produced in the pineal gland. Callaway pointedto yet another mechanism underlying the ayahuasca experience: tetrahydroharmine,the second major alkaloid in Banisteriopsis caapi, closely resembles pinoline,and is a moderately potent presynaptic serotonin reuptake inhibitor thatcontributes to higher levels of serotonin in the synapses of serotonergeticbrain cells. Subjectively, this would translate into higher alertness while theperson is experiencing the effects of DMT. We could say, metaphorically, thatunder the influence of ayahuasca, an individual is both fully awake (due to thehigher levels of synaptic serotonin) and dreaming, as Callaway presented in hishypothesis that DMT may be involved in the experience of dreams, particularlyduring REM sleep.14 [index_split_017.html#filepos834851] As Rick Strassman hasindicated,15 [index_split_017.html#filepos835111] DMT is present in all mammals,including human beings, and it has been detected in blood, urine, andcerebrospinal fluid. Callaway coined the term endohuasca to indicate that thehuman organism synthesizes compounds identical or similar to those found in theayahuasca brew. Ayahuasca brews vary, depending upon the mode of preparation and the specificspecimens used. McKenna et al. calculated that the 100 ml dose of ayahuasca usedamong mestizo ayahuasqueros contains 467 mg of harmine, 160 mg oftetrahydroharmine, 41 mg of harmaline, and 60 mg of DMT.16[index_split_017.html#filepos835282] THE FIRST AYAHUASCA SYMPOSIUM Dennis McKenna and I became close friends and collaborators. Back in Vancouver,we wrote a proposal for a biomedical study of ayahuasca which found no fundingat that time, but which, years later, was the basis of the first study of thiskind, carried out in Brazil. I also thought of organizing an interdisciplinarysymposium on ayahuasca within the 45th Americanist Conference, a biannualmeeting of social scientists that took place alternately in Europe and theAmericas and which was to take place in Bogotá in July 1985, at the Universidadde los Andes. It turned out to be a fruitful conference, with participants from severalcountries and a number of disciplines—including botany, pharmacology,archaeology, ethnography, and ethnomusicology, all papers that were published ina special issue of América Indígena in Mexico. Among the lecturers was GuillermoArvalo, a young Shipibo shaman I had met the year before in Pucallpa, Peru. Iasked him to write a twenty-page paper to be presented at the conference, whichwas the first he’d ever attended. He told me he followed the prescribedayahuasca diet while he wrote the paper, a landmark in the study of Shipiboshamanism. Another interesting guest was Clodomir Monteiro, a pioneer in the study ofBrazilian religious organizations that use ayahuasca as a sacrament. He hadinvited me to Rio Branco, capital of the state of Acre, some months earlier. Ilearned that in the 1930s, in the vicinity of the city, Raimundo Irineo Serra(1892–1971), a black man who had moved to the Amazon from Maranhão, in theBrazilian northeast, created a new religion after receiving ayahuasca from aPeruvian vegetalista. In his visions, so the legend goes, the Queen of theForest, a manifestation of the Virgin Mary, had appeared and asked him to createa new religious organization using ayahuasca—under the name Santo Daime—as asacrament. Daniel Pereira de Matos (1904–1958) took Santo Daime several times with IrineuSerra and several times by himself. During one of these experiences, he is saidto have received a blue book from an angel, and in 1945, he created a secondorganization, known as Barquinha (little boat). After the death of Irineu Serra,a group led by Sebastião Mota (1920–1990) separated from the parent organizationand created Centro Ecléctico da Fluente Luz Universal Raimundo Irineu Serra(CEFLURIS), another religious organization. Finally, José Gabriel da Costa(1922–1971) created a third organization in 1961, the União do Vegetal (UDV), inPorto Velho, the capital of the state of Rondonia, also in the Amazon. Thesechurches are syncretic Christian religious organizations that use ayahuasca as asacrament and incorporate Afro-Brazilian religious elements along with Europeanesoteric and Amazonian concepts. Monteiro, the Brazilian anthropologist,organized a screening of my film on don Emilio, which was presented as adocumentary on the origins of the Santo Daime religion and was attended bymembers of all three religious organizations. According to Monteiro, this wasthe first time they were all present under the same roof. Guided by Monteiro, I visited Alto Santo, the original center created byRaimundo Irineu Serra and led until the present day by his widow, SenhoraPeregrina. I also visited Colonia 5000, the original CEFLURIS center, on theoutskirts of Rio Branco. A small group of men, including an Italian and anArgentinean, were cleaning and pounding the Banisteriopsis vine, while somewomen were harvesting the Psychotria leaves from a cultivated field. We tookSanto Daime that night at the edge of the forest under a nearly full moon.Accompanied by guitars, the group sang hinos, songs received from the astralworld by the founders and other members of the community. Their brew wasstronger than those usually prepared by Peruvian ayahuasqueros. I had theoverwhelming sensation that the forest out there was intelligent and populatedby invisible beings. At some point, I felt my body dissolving into waves.Concerned, I did not dare abandon myself completely to the experience, and Imade internal efforts to counteract it by focusing on my immediate environment.The deepest ayahuasca experiences involve ego dissolution, which requires thatan individual be totally confident of the setting. I did not know my new friendswell enough to let go as deeply as I might have otherwise. Finally, Monteirotook me to see Manoel Hipólito Araújo, the leader of the main Barquinha center,whom I interviewed, though I did not participate in any of the ceremonies. COSMOGRAPHY OF MESTIZO SHAMANISM After the Bogotá conference, Dennis McKenna and I met in Pucallpa, the secondlargest city in the Peruvian Amazon, on the shores of the Ucayali River. He hadmet don Fidel, an ayahuasquero, some years earlier while collecting plants withhis brother Terence for Botanical Dimensions, an ethnobotanical garden theycreated in Hawaii. Dennis went to Pucallpa several days ahead of me. When Iarrived at the dusty airport, a taxi driver was whispering my name to alldisembarking passengers. I identified myself and went at once to a poor area ofthe city where Dennis was awaiting me. I crossed a sparse garden and entered the wooden house where an ayahuascasession was starting. “Just in time,” Dennis said. He introduced me to donFidel, who almost immediately handed me a small gourd with the brew. I knew Iwas going to take ayahuasca in Pucallpa, but didn’t expect it to happen so soon.It was the beginning of an intense period in which we collected plants with theassistance of Francisco Montes Shua, a knowledgeable young man Dennis had met in1983 in the Huallaga River area. Dennis told me Francisco had a cousin who alsoknew about plants. “A little strange,” he said. “I am interested,” I replied, as I was interviewing ayahuasqueros and desiredany information I could find about the plant teachers. Pablo Amaringo Shua lived with his mother, two adopted children, and othermembers of his family in a humble wooden house with little furniture and noelectricity or running water in a swampy area in one of the poorest districts ofPucallpa. He knew a great deal about plant teachers and medicinal plants andtold me that for seven years he had been a vegetalista, but had deserted hispractice after a spiritual crisis. He said that the spirits “had abandoned him”and he had been forced to leave his practice after a conflict with anayahuasquera. He also showed us some beautiful gouache paintings on cheap paperdepicting scenes from the life of river people as well as jungle landscapes. Iwas impressed by the accuracy of the elements in the paintings. I realized hehad an excellent eidetic memory and wondered whether he could recall the visionshe had when he was a vegetalista. He said he could, and some days later heshowed Dennis and me his first two visions, giving each of us one of them. Back in Helsinki, I studied the one he had given me, made a photocopy of it, andmailed it to Pablo, asking him about the meaning of various elements, includingangels, warriors with exotic clothes, kings sitting on thrones, a city that wasboth ancient and futuristic, and a flying saucer. A few weeks later I receivedback from Pablo a long and detailed description, including the names of thebeings depicted. I realized the importance of this kind of information, becausethrough Pablo’s paintings it was possible to see a concrete representation ofthe visions of a mestizo ayahuasquero. It was the beginning of several years ofintense collaboration during which he produced approximately one hundredpaintings, forty-nine of which were published in 1991 in Ayahuasca Visions: TheReligious Iconography of a Peruvian Shaman.17[index_split_017.html#filepos835660] Besides placing Amaringo in the context ofmestizo river shamanism, I identified plants and animals depicted in his workand found ideological and iconographic parallels between the paintings’ motifsand the images in Amazonian and Andean cosmology. What was striking about Pablo Amaringo was first of all the scope and variety ofhis visions. It was difficult to believe that this humble Amazonian man hadvisions of distant cities with amazing architecture, exotically dressed alienbeings of all kinds, and strange flying machines and that he knew that we livein a multidimensional universe populated by intelligent beings whom we cancontact. Was Amaringo an exception? Perhaps not. I showed prints of hispaintings to many local people who used ayahuasca. Everyone recognized ayahuascaimmediately as the source of these images. Moreover, once the book waspublished, fellow anthropologists took it to various indigenous Amazoniancommunities, causing a certain commotion. Perhaps there is something common tothe ayahuasca experience that transcends cultural diversity to a certain extent,even though specific metaphors from its effects may vary. In 1986, I received a John Simon Guggenheim fellowship to study the ethnobotanyof the Colombian and Peruvian Amazon, thanks to recommendations from RichardEvans Schultes, Peter Furst, and other researchers. For the first time, I hadthe luxury of concentrating on this endeavor fully for a year. Up until then, Ihad only my summer holidays available. I spent several months in the UnitedStates, visiting various specialists. For several weeks, Schultes hosted me inhis home, where I could examine his amazing private library. At some point hegave me what he called a “red carpet,” a card crediting me as a researchassociate of the Botanical Museum of Harvard University. He also advised me togo to the Sibundoy Valley, in the Colombian Upper Putumayo, to get acquaintedwith the ethnobotanical knowledge of the Kamsá and Ingano, the two indigenousgroups that inhabited this beautiful valley high in the Andes. In 1941, Schultes himself had done extensive fieldwork in the region, which isespecially famous for the large number of species of Brugmansia, locally knownas borracheros, growing there. Some of these species contain greatconcentrations of atropine and scopolamine and are highly regarded by localshamans, who cultivate them in their gardens. Mel Bristol, one of Schultes’sgraduate students, wrote his doctoral dissertation on Sibundoy ethnobotany in1965. He realized that yagé was used in this area to study the properties ofother plants, which was one of the ways through which curanderos, local healers,were able to expand their pharmacopeia. I spent a month with don SalvadorChindoy and his son Miguel Chindoy, Kamsá shamans with whom Schultes had worked,and collected plants with the help of Pedro Juajibioy, also a Kamsá, who, withSchultes’s help, had studied botany in the United States. Two beautiful sayings of the Kamsá have remained with me. The first I receivedfrom a young apprentice who was staying with don Miguel at that time. In aninterview he referred to the garden of medicinal plants that the Kamsá andIngano shaman have around their homes as el jardín de la ciencia (the garden ofscience), another way of expressing the idea of Peruvian vegetalistas thatcertain plants are plant teachers or doctors. The second goes like this: When weare in the womb of our mothers, we are connected to the placenta, which is forus the universe. When we are born, the umbilical cord is cut. Yag is a newumbilical cord connecting us to the universe. A drawback for me while I was with the Kamsá is their use of alcohol. They drinkchicha, a maize beer, heavily, and several times they tried to get me drunk.They also drink aguardiente, sugarcane liquor, in the yagé sessions, somethingthat did not match my own habits or the views of don Emilio, who said that whenyou are learning with ayahuasca, you should not drink “even a drop of alcohol.” After a month in the Sibundoy Valley, I decided to go back to Peru to look for ateacher. My Shipibo friend Guillermo Arvalo advised me to go to Santa Rosa dePirococha, a small indigenous settlement on the shores of the Ucayali River,where I would meet don Basilio Gordon, a reputed shaman who he said would helpme. I took a ferry from Pucallpa and arrived carrying a few presents: tobaccoand some clothes for don Basilio, beads for the women, and candies for thechildren. Someone advised me also to take several kilograms of sugar. I was wellreceived by don Basilio, who let me stay with his family. The next morning, oneof his daughters came to my mosquito netting–covered bed with a steaming cup.“Here is your tea,” she said. I tasted it. It was hot water with sugar. Somehours later she came with another cup. “Here is your lemonade.” It was coldwater with sugar. Two days later they had run out of sugar. Don Basilio told methat we were all going to Orellana to get some things. I realized his wholefamily expected me to buy them presents! I took all the money I had with me, putaside the amount I needed to pay for the boat back to Pucallpa after my stay inSanta Rosa, and gave don Basilio the rest to buy whatever they wanted. “This isall I have,” I said. They bought some clothes and twenty-five kilograms ofsugar, to which they were all heavily addicted, judging by the condition oftheir teeth. I stayed with don Basilio for a month, during which I took ayahuasca thirteentimes. My visions were mostly of a sort of underground, dark world. There wasvery little food available, just manioc and, from time to time, a little fish. Iwas able to watch don Basilio’s work. He took ayahuasca nearly every night, andkept singing from nine o’clock in the evening to one or two in the morning,sometimes accompanied by an apprentice and a few patients. I did not see himusing any other medicinal plants. “You need the plant only if you do not knowits song,” he told me. After a difficult month during which I was tormented by mosquitoes and hunger, Iwas ready to leave. Don Basilio told me he was giving me an arcana, aprotection, before I went back to the city. He sang a song over me, and I askedhim, “What kind of protection are you giving me?” From the floor of his house he took a skirt that was covered with geometricpatterns, for which the Shipibo are well known. “I am giving you this,” he said. This was a confirmation of the work of the German ethnologist Angelika Gebhart,who realized that the colorful and intricate patterns found in the textiles,ceramics, and body painting of the Shipibo are to a certain extentrepresentations of the songs of the spirits that shamans hear as they travel inthe upper realm under the influence of ayahuasca. The shaman sings with thespirits, and then women are somehow able to transform the songs into beautifulpatterns. The Shipibo believe their bodies are covered with normally invisiblegeometrical patterns. Illness is a disruption of the patterns. The songs of theshaman restore the patterns either directly or through a hummingbird spirit thatcreates music with his wings. The connection between ayahuasca visions and theartistic manifestations of Upper Amazon indigenous groups had already beenpointed out by Reichel-Dolmatoff among the Tukano of the Vaupés River region inColombia and Brazil, and by Jean Langdon among the Siona of southeasternColombia. These anthropologists also showed that a significant proportion oftheir narrative refers to journeys to other realms guided by shamans, and theirencounters with the yagé people. I had to wait for a boat back to Pucallpa. The family of a mestizo colonist gaveme a plate of rice crowned by a fried egg, one of the best meals I have ever hadin my life. The wait lasted for one and a half days. Finally, after quickgood-byes to my friends, I was on board one of those Amazonian river ferriesthat has layers of hammocks hanging from its sides. There was nothing to do butchat, read, or look at the magnificent Ucayali River. I had probably slept for several hours when I was awakened by one of thesailors: The captain wanted to see me. He pointed to the sky—at about 45 degreesabove the horizon I saw a bright light that was about one third the size of thefull moon, which over the course of about a half hour rose slowly in the skyuntil it became invisible. In the meantime, the captain told me stories of othersuch apparitions, for he spent many nights looking at the sky while at the wheelof his boat. Once he saw a huge saucer hovering some hundred meters in front ofthe craft, forcing him to stop the boat in terror before it ascended to the sky.I did not have a tape recorder with me then. About a year later and with myvideo camera, I looked for the boat at the Pucallpa harbor. I found it and wentdown to the machine room, where several people were working to clean the engine.I was told that the captain was now working on another boat somewhere else.Disappointed, I was about to leave when it occurred to me to ask the men whetherthey had seen any flying saucers. Nearly all of them said they had. I laterrealized that tales of flying objects in various disguises are quite commonamong the river people of the Peruvian Amazon. Pablo Amaringo’s ayahuasca visions include many depictions of UFOs. “They arenot machines,” he said. “They are spirits, and come from other dimensions” (seehttp://deoxy.org/ayalien.htm [http://deoxy.org/ayalien.htm]). As Valle haspointed out,18 [index_split_017.html#filepos835932] the UFOs are physicalmanifestations that cannot be understood apart from their psychic and symbolicreality. The UFO motif is a subject that should not be neglected by cognitiveanthropologists, depth psychologists, and those interested in the mythologies ofmodern man. To my knowledge, there has been no study of this motif byanthropologists. I myself have avoided mentioning UFOs in my writings, becauseconsideration of their accounts is not well received in academic circles. Yetthey should be taken into consideration. I realized, for example, that theso-called supay-lancha, a big serpent boat believed by river people to appearsometimes at night, is one of the manifestations of the snake canoe of Amazonianmyths. Flying saucers may be one more manifestation of the so-called huairamama(from the Quechua huaira, meaning “air,” and mama, meaning “mother”), a flyingserpent that alien beings of various kinds may use to travel. STUDYING THE BRAZILIAN AYAHUASCA PHENOMENON In May 1991, Dennis McKenna and I were invited to be guest lecturers at the ICongresso em Sade (First Conference on Health) in Sa Paulo, organized by theCenter of Medical Studies of the UDV, one of the three religious organizationsthat use ayahuasca as a sacrament and the one with the greatest number ofmembers—about seven thousand spread across all Brazilian states. Approximately 5to 7 percent of the members of the UDV are health care professionals, includingmedical doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists, homeopathic physicians, andchiropractors. During the conference, Dennis and I presented to them thepossibility of carrying out a biomedical study of ayahuasca, which we had beenconsidering since 1985. The idea was accepted enthusiastically and the study wasstarted in July 1993. I was not able to join the group, but Jace Callaway, the pinoline specialist Imet in Finland, McKenna, Charles Grob, and Glacus de Souza Brito (a member ofthe UDV) conducted the research at one of the oldest centers of theorganization, in Manaus, in the state of Amazonas, with subsequent laboratoryinvestigations in Brazilian, American, and Finnish universities. The study wasfunded by Botanical Dimensions, the Heffter Institute, and the MultidisciplinaryAssociation for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS). They performed psychologicalevaluations of fifteen members of the UDV, each of whom had been a member formore than ten years, and had been drinking ayahuasca once every two weeks,comparing the results to those of fifteen control subjects from a similarsocioeconomic background who did not drink ayahuasca. The published studies19 [index_split_017.html#filepos836176] showed that membersof the UDV had exceptionally healthy psychological profiles. They hadsignificantly greater confidence versus fear of uncertainty, trends towardgreater gregariousness versus shyness, and greater optimism versus anticipatoryworry. They also showed greater stoic rigidity versus exploratory excitability,greater regimentation versus disorderliness, and a trend toward greaterreflection versus impulsivity. None of the UDV subjects showed evidence of anyneurological or psychiatric deficits. Five of them had diagnoses of formeralcohol abuse disorders, two had past major depressive disorders, and three hadpast phobic anxiety disorders. The team took blood samples and also studied the pharmacokinetics of thealkaloids in the brew. An interesting finding was that ayahuasca drinkers have ahigher density of serotonin transporter receptors in blood platelets. Back inFinland, Jace Callaway conducted self-experimentation with ayahuasca, and, usingSingle Photon Emission Computerized Tomography (SPECT) scanning facilities atKuopio University, found a higher density of serotonin transporter receptors inhis frontal cortex, which returned to normal levels after he stopped drinkingthe brew. It is not clear what this means, but it is interesting that a deficitof serotonin-uptake sites in this area has been found to correlate withaggression disorders in violent alcoholics. If tetrahydroharmine is able toreverse this deficit specifically, it may have applications in the treatment ofthis syndrome. Ayahuasca has been used in the treatment of alcoholism and drugabuse, especially in cocaine and heroine addiction, at Takiwasi, an institutioncreated in Tarapoto, Peru, by the French physician Jacques Mabit, who arrived inthe Peruvian Amazon in 1986 to work for Doctors without Borders (Mdicins SansFrontires). There he familiarized himself with the ayahuasca mestizo traditionand incorporated it into his own practice. Dr. Mabit has been working theretogether with his Peruvian wife, Rosa Giove, who is a psychologist. My relationship to the Brazilian ayahuasca phenomenon deepened as I arrived inFlorianópolis, in southern Brazil, to take the position of visiting professor inthe department of anthropology at Federal Santa Catarina University. ProfessorJean Langdon, one of the pioneers in ayahuasca ethnological research due to herwork among the Siona of Colombia, encouraged me to apply for this position. Iasked permission from the UDV to conduct research among its members, and wasable to visit many of its centers all over Brazil, conducting interviews andparticipating in rituals. The UDV is an initiate religious organization with ahighly hierarchical organization and four levels of initiation. Only men canachieve the fourth level, that of a mestre (master). Rising through the ranksdepends upon, in part, the memorization of a series of histórias (stories),which are gradually revealed orally to the neophyte, and upon conducting apublic and private life according to the precepts of the organization. The main reason for taking the brew is, in the context of UDV, the individual’sspiritual development. Regular members take vegetal (ayahuasca) every two weeks.Members higher up in the hierarchy take it more often and have special sessionsreserved just for them. I was only invited to general sessions. The rituals arevery simple and are conducted by a mestre. All members take the brewsimultaneously and spend the rest of the session sitting in comfortable chairs.The temple is well lit and has a minimum of decorative elements. The main textsof the organization are read when people are already feeling the effects of thebrew. From time to time, the mestre sings a chamada, one of the songs taught bythe founder, Mestre Gabriel, or revealed to one of the members of theorganization. The songs have to be approved by one of the highest committees inthe organization. The mestre also addresses the community, commenting on variousaspects of the doctrine. Members can ask questions or ask permission to addressother participants. Prerecorded music is also played during parts of thesession. Although members of the UDV emphasize the originality of MestreGabriel’s teachings, these may be seen as arising within the context of aheretofore poorly documented Brazilian vegetalista tradition. I once met anayahuasquero, Senhor Domingo, in Boca do Acre, a town some kilometers from RioBranco, who sang variations of some of the songs received by Mestre Gabriel“from the astral plane.” Perhaps the most striking element of the UDV’s use of ayahuasca is what theycall the “mystery of the word.” The organization’s members cultivate a carefuluse of language, because they believe that words spoken under the influence ofthe brew are particularly powerful. Even mestres with a modest degree of formaleducation can be very eloquent when conducting sessions under the effects ofayahuasca. If we employ the frequently used metaphor of right–left hemisphere,we could say that the UDV is predominantly left hemispheric, seeking the orderlyapplication of speech. Many of its members are highly educated, includinguniversity professors, lawyers, and journalists. It is to a great extent becauseof the influence of the UDV that the religious use of ayahuasca was approved inBrazil in 1987. The organization has some centers outside Brazil, including theUnited States, where, in 2005, a lawsuit seeking the exercise of its rituals wasdecided in the UDV’s favor by the U.S. Supreme Court. In June 1995, I went back to Rio Branco, in the state of Acre in the BrazilianAmazon, where I experienced for the first time the rituals of the Barquinha, thereligious organization created by Daniel Pereira de Matos. In several ways,these are radically different from those of the UDV. The churches of theBarquinha are profusely adorned with effigies of Jesus, Mary, and varioussaints. The faithful participate in long rituals in which the whole communityprays and sings hinos in the church. After midnight on special days, they havefestas (celebrations) during which they dance for many hours, accompanied by therhythm of musical instruments (drums, guitars, and electric piano). Some membersincorporate spirits of the Afro-Brazilian pantheon: pretos velhos (spirits ofblack slaves), caboclos (spirits of Indians), eres (spirits of children), andencantados (spirits of princes and princesses incarnated in plants or animals).The first time I joined the members dancing around a coreto, a central bandstandwhere the musicians were playing, it was like entering an invisible stream thatcarried me along with the other celebrants. This is the Brazilian religiousorganization with the greatest number of church rituals. I calculated thatduring 1995, one of the three Barquinha churches had 173 rituals in the churchand nineteen celebrations—a total of 192 ceremonies in which members took SantoDaime. In spite of this intense, ritual life, members of the church have regularjobs. One of the consequences of repetitive use of ayahuasca is the need for lesssleep. Jace Callaway speculates that the visionary state is perhaps equivalentto REM sleep; hence, the individual who take ayahuasca feels refreshed even ifhe or she sleeps only four or five hours every day. Among the members of thechurch, I did not see any signs of health deterioration due to the use ofayahuasca. Some of them are third-generation members of the church who havetaken ayahuasca literally since they were in the wombs of their mothers—womentake ayahuasca throughout pregnancy, give birth under the effects of the brew,and breast-feed their children while they are active members of the religiousorganization. For several years, I dedicated my free time to conduct fieldwork among membersof the Barquinha: I participated in many rituals and observed special healingand counseling sessions in which several mediums incorporate the spirits ofblack slaves to give advice about various matters to people seeking guidance insolving their physical or emotional problems.20[index_split_017.html#filepos837330] The mediums in Barquinha claim that theyare conscious and maintain their identity, while, simultaneously, they feel thepresence of other beings who talk through them. More than once, I consulted withthe pretos velhos, and I was always surprised at the wise words of theseotherwise ordinary people. Once, I went to the forest to harvest Banisteriopsisvine, which may grow all the way up to the forest canopy; it is sometimesnecessary to climb quite high to cut its farthest sections. The church memberstold me the story of one their fellows who suffered a panic attack whenharvesting the vine twenty meters above the ground. He finally incorporated apreto velho, who helped him climb down safely. This made me think of thepossible evolutionary advantages of altered states of consciousness. Barquinha people prepare the strongest ayahuasca I have encountered in all theyears I have been studying the brew. They add more Psychotria to the preparationthan the other religious organizations and Peruvian mestizo shamans. Theirdedication to their religion is total, encompassing both their spiritual andsocial life. RESEARCH CENTER In 1997, twenty-six years after my first ayahuasca experience, at the request ofsome friends, I invited them to take the brew under my guidance. Gradually, Igained confidence and started to conduct sessions from time to time, creating,ultimately, a simple ritual that incorporated some of the techniques I hadwitnessed during my years of exposure to various traditions as well as my ownways of conducting sessions. In 1998, I went back to Helsinki but did not cut myties with Brazil. I acquired a piece of land in Florianópolis and built a house,the site of Wasiwaska—Research Centre for the Study of Psychointegrator Plants,Visionary Art and Consciousness, a nonprofit organization dedicated first andforemost to ayahuasca research. The term psychointegrator has been adopted fromMichael Winkelman,21 [index_split_017.html#filepos837603] who proposed it as analternative to hallucinogen, psychedelic, and psychotomimetic to represent thecentral effects of these important spiritual, therapeutic, and mystical agentsas well as their primary effects at physiological, experiential, psychological,and social levels. Several studies have been conducted at Wasiwaska. Two of them, led by EdeFrecska, evaluated effects of ayahuasca on binocular rivalry, a class of visualillusion in which an ambiguous but unchanging sensory input leads to suddenperceptual switches. Rivalry phenomena occur when dissimilar images stimulatecorresponding retinal areas of both eyes. During rivalry, the image present inone eye disappears from awareness (i.e., it is suppressed), while only the othereye’s image is perceived (i.e., it is dominant). Ingestion of ayahuasca resultedin a decrease of rivalry alternation rates and an increase in the length of onepercept. In addition, there was evidence of perceptual fusion.22[index_split_017.html#filepos837998] The latter may indicate the presence ofinter-hemispheric fusion as an underlying neurological process of thepsychedelic experience. A second study explored the effects of ayahuasca on binocular rivalry withdichoptic stimulus alternation (DSA). Stimuli are applied to the eyes in arapidly alternating, instead of constant, manner. It was concluded thatayahuasca induces changes of gamma oscillations in the visual pathways.23[index_split_017.html#filepos838377] Gamma (20–70 Hz) brain wave oscillationsare prominent in the active brain. They represent a widely studied band of EEGfrequencies cooccurring with information acquisition and are associated withvarious behavioral functions ranging from sensory binding to memory. Neuronsthat oscillate together (within one millisecond precision) work togetherregardless of how far apart they are from each other in the brain. Gamma oscillation can be conceptualized as the clock speed of the group ofsynchronized neurons that are processing the same task—for example, bindingseveral sensory inputs (visual, auditory, etc.) into one subjective percept orperforming memory tasks. Gamma synchronization may explain some experiences ofaltered states of consciousness. For example, synesthesia, such as “seeing”sound, can come from synchronized activity of some visual and auditory neurons.It may also reflect the “binding” of the elements in normal consciousness. EEG studies of ayahuasca were carried out in 2000 by David Stuckey, under thedirection of Professor Frank Echenhofer of the California Institute of IntegralStudies, San Francisco. The study was carried out using only two experiencedsubjects. The most important finding was that in both subjects, global EEGcoherence increased in the gamma frequency band for ayahuasca. Coherence is ameasure of the similarities of the EEG at two different sites and can beconsidered as a measure of communication between two regions of the brain.Widely distributed cortical hypercoherence seems reasonable given the intense,synesthetic phenomena that often take place during the ayahuasca experience.24[index_split_017.html#filepos838699] During intense meditative experiences byZen monks,25 [index_split_017.html#filepos839035] there are reported high levelsof gamma activity and coherence in the brain, especially in the frontal lobes,an area of the brain (the “new brain”) that seems to be crucial in the processof awakening to a higher level of consciousness.26[index_split_017.html#filepos839399] In 2005, Frank Echenhofer and Katée Wynia conducted additional research inWasiwaska during a seminar with twelve subjects from nine countries. Althoughbrain wave analysis is not yet completed, preliminary results show alpha andtheta decrease, while confirming gamma coherence increase as well as an increasein beta coherence. These changes can be viewed as suggesting an increase incortical activation, alertness, arousal with enhanced information processing,and enhanced neural and cognitive complexity.27[index_split_017.html#filepos839671] image [images/00003.jpg] All these years of studying ayahuasca have been very rewarding for me, not onlyin terms of personal experiences but also as the result of collaboration withscientists in various disciplines as well as with artists and other creativepeople. My current work as a facilitator has garnered me contact withextraordinary individuals from many parts of the world. No doubt, ayahuasca hasgreat potential for the study of consciousness as well as for therapeutic use.As Penrose has stated, “[A] scientific world-view which does not profoundly cometo terms with the problem of conscious minds can have no serious pretensions ofcompleteness. Consciousness is part of our universe, so any physical theorywhich makes no proper place for it falls fundamentally short of providing agenuine description of the world.”28 [index_split_017.html#filepos840074] I believe ayahuasca—as well as other psychointegrator plants and substances—canbe an extraordinary tool for the study of consciousness. Ayahuasca and otherplant teachers, as pointed out by Tupper,29 [index_split_017.html#filepos840328]may enhance “existential intelligence,” which Howard Gardner, proponent of theTheory of Multiple Intelligence, characterizes as involving “a heightenedcapacity of appreciation and attention to the cosmological enigmas that definethe human condition—an exceptional awareness of the metaphysical, ontological,and epistemological mysteries that have been a perennial concern for people ofall cultures.” At the same time, it is necessary to exercise caution, for the number ofcontemporary ayahuasqueros from many countries is growing, and not all of themhave enough personal training to deal with the wide spectrum of effectsayahuasca may produce. Special attention must be paid to set and setting, withset referring to the intentions, expectations, and presuppositions of thoseparticipating in the ayahuasca session and setting referring to the concretecircumstances in which the action takes place, including the set of those inwhose presence the ayahuasca is taken. If used in the proper setting, thenegative side effects of ayahuasca seem to be minimal. Its strong emetic andcathartic effects as well as the often dramatic psychological effects itproduces cause respect for its use, thus reducing potential for abuse. Thespontaneous reaction of many people to ayahuasca is the acknowledgment that theyare dealing with something sacred. It is most important to take care in choosing the people with whom the brew istaken. When dealing with individual shamans or practitioners, it is important todiscern the experience and intentions of the leader in question, for anyone whotakes ayahuasca may enter into a vulnerable emotional space in which support isneeded. Religious organizations are usually trustworthy in these respects,thanks to the high ethics and the memberships’ experience with ayahuasca. Yetthese also have their limitations, as the framework they offer may be too rigiddue to their doctrinal “truths” if they do not resonate with one’s ownconvictions. The mystery of ayahuasca always remains, and it is beyond anyparticular set of ideas. In my own work, I emphasize exploration of one’s ownpresuppositions and then the sharing of experiences, so that we may learn fromeach other. In our current fragmented and ever-changing postmodern world, the rediscoveryand restoration of traditional integrative techniques may become crucial,especially in view of the present ecological crisis caused by humans. There isno contradiction between the scientific and the shamanic understanding of humanexistence and the nature of reality. Instead, these approaches arecomplementary, and may allow a greater understanding of the multidimensionalworld in which we live. "},{"pageContent":"image [images/00004.jpg] 5image [images/00004.jpg] The Varieties of the Ayahuasca Experience Luis Eduardo Luna, Ph.D. The use of ayahuasca has been documented among indigenous Amazonian groups,mestizo practitioners, and members of Brazilian religious organizations. Thereis also a growing body of scientific knowledge from various disciplinesregarding ayahuasca as well as a number of reports in popular publications andon the Internet describing people’s experiences with the brew in variouscontemporary settings. Here lies a great opportunity to learn about thepotential of this powerful psychotropic combination, one of the greatestdiscoveries of indigenous Amazonians. We could also add to our exploratory listother South American discoveries: curare, the arrow poison made from severalspecies of the genus Strychnos, which contain muscles relaxants without whichopen-heart surgery would not be possible; quinine, pivotal in the fight againstmalaria; and rubber, essential for the tires and tubes of the twentiethcentury’s transportation revolution. As they are with taking any other psychotropic plants or substances, set andsetting are absolutely crucial to the effects of taking ayahuasca. When treatingtheir patients, indigenous and mestizo practitioners usually demand a period ofpreparation that may include one to several days of dietary restrictions andsexual abstinence before and after a session, especially when illness isbelieved to be caused by an animate agent, spirit, or person. These requirementsare much more flexible when these practitioners are dealing with non-Amazonians. Among religious organizations, there is less or even no emphasis on diet, exceptfor alcohol, which is generally not consumed at all. More important are thereligious calendar (usually rather demanding), the particular doctrine of eachorganization, and the ritual procedures followed by the organization. Evenwithin a religious organization, there are different kinds of sessions thataffect participants differently. In the religious organization known asBarquinha, for example, some sessions may emphasize devotion, some may befocused more on healing, and some may emphasize the incorporation of spirits whogive advice through mediums. The União do Vegetal (UDV) has regular sessions forall members and special sessions in which some members are initiated intospecific, secret teachings. Especially important for religious organizations arethe so-called fetios or preparos, during which the brew is prepared whilemembers are under its effects. Unlike religious groups, independentpractitioners often have their own rules, depending on the traditions in whichthey trained and their particular inclinations. Traditional ayahuasca sessions are idiosyncratic to a certain extent, involvinga variety of ritual procedures and the playing of different musical instruments.Among mestizo practitioners, there are often invocations to protective powers(which may include Jesus and Mary) at the onset of the ceremonies. Suchinvocations contribute to a feeling of trust, as participants are oftenapprehensive, regardless of their past experiences with ayahuasca. In the lastdecade, the advent of new ayahuasqueros who come from different countries anddiverse cultural backgrounds has increased the variety of ayahuasca rituals.Some contemporary practitioners, for example, incorporate techniques andprocedures from various therapeutic schools. We will concentrate here on certain aspects of ritual ayahuasca use, rather thanrecreational use—a type of respectful practice that is neither strictly shamanicnor religious. Participants in this kind of ritual setting normally do not sharea common cosmology, as is the case among indigenous groups, or a set ofreligious beliefs, such as that proposed by Brazilian syncretic religiousorganizations. In this model of ritual, the philosophical and existentialpresuppositions of each person vary, depending on each individual’s backgroundand inclinations. A comparable model is the work of Siona shamans as describedby Langdon,1 [index_split_017.html#filepos840798] who, through songs, guide thecommunity to specific locations of their spiritual geography, which consists ofseveral domains characterized by specific sounds, rhythms, music, smells, andcolors. They take yagé (ayahuasca) during three consecutive nights during whichthey visit, for instance, the High River of one of the domains of “the otherside.” Under appropriate conditions, ayahuasca allows those who take it to enter intomysteriously deep states of consciousness in which a person may confront thegreat questions, especially those of our own temporality. Such questions dealwith the great unknown—with the deepest mysteries of existence, and thereforewith the sacred. Certain procedures seem to be conducive to deeper experiences. By the timeparticipants have their first session, they should be already acquainted,through lectures, films, or publications, with the botany, pharmacology, anddifferent aspects of traditional ethnographic use of ayahuasca. Ideally, theyhave seen the living plants and know how the particular brew they are to takehas been prepared. They should also be aware of the necessity to avoidsubstances such as antidepressants at least two weeks before the experience, aswell as certain foods that may affect them adversely. All unnecessary medicinesshould be discontinued at least a week prior to the experience to avoid anypossible adverse interaction with ayahuasca. The more thoroughly a person hasprepared himself for the ayahuasca journey, the better the outcome of theexperience. All rituals presuppose the delimitation of ritual space and time. The spaceshould be protective, beautiful, and as close to nature as possible, whereparticipants can be sure that there will be no disturbances. An aestheticallypleasant environment supports deep inner exploration. The brew often takes aperson to profound, even frightening recesses of the human psyche. To emergefrom such depths to a beautiful setting is comforting. The time of day is alsoimportant. Most sessions begin at around eight or nine in the evening and extendinto the early hours of the next day. Astrologic variables may be taken intoconsideration. Based on substantial data related in public lectures, Stan Grofand Richard Tarnas came to the conclusion that an analysis of natal charts,personal transits, and world transits yields the best explanation we have so farto account for the great variety of psychedelic experiences described by thesame person at different times. Group experiences often offer the best session results, perhaps because a sortof synergistic process takes place. It is reassuring to know that each of us isnot alone in the potential struggle of accessing new information about the selfor the inner world. The metaphor of the spirit canoe is sometimes used byayahuasqueros: although participants may have their individual experiences,there is also the feeling of solidarity during the journey. Ayahuasca is full of surprises. Even in several sessions that occur insuccession within a few days, experiences may differ greatly. In fact, there isgreat variability all along—from the preparation stage to the ingestion stage.First, there is variability in the brew itself, depending on the specific plantsused (admixture plants can be different and include Psychotria viridis orDiplopterys cabrerana and other plants), the age of the plants, the soilconditions in which the plants have grown, the part of the plant used, and eventhe particular time of harvesting (month, moon phase, and time of the day). Themode of preparation of the brew is also important: the ratio of the plantingredients, the hours of boiling, and a number of other factors of which onlyexperienced ayahuasqueros may know—the intensity of the fire used; the way thebrew is bottled; even, as it is often claimed, the thoughts and intentions ofthe people preparing the brew. Second, it is important to recognize that everyperson is different physiologically, psychologically, and culturally. Somepeople are quick to metabolize the active compounds in the brew; some metabolizethem more slowly. Some people are more sensitive to the brew. For some—probablymost—it is best to have an empty stomach before taking the brew. For others,though, it is best to eat a little before or even after taking the brew to aidin the absorption of the active alkaloids. Most people begin to feel the effects after forty-five minutes to an hour—butsome people may feel them after only twenty minutes, and others may feel littleuntil an hour and a half or even two hours have passed. In the Peruvianayahuasca tradition, local ayahuasqueros often ask people to “keep the diet”three days before and three days after the session. This implies no salt orsugar, no sex of any kind, and no alcohol or cold drinks, along with some otherdietary restrictions. How strict the diet is depends on the intention of theperson taking ayahuasca: Is it for healing, for learning from the plants, orsimply for curiosity? In traditional societies, when the aim is to become anayahuasquero, the diet is much stricter, consisting of only plantains, manioc,rice, and small fish with little fat. Ideally, an experienced leader—someone who is familiar with the varieties ofstates elicited by ayahuasca—should conduct the session. The role of thefacilitator in an ayahuasca session is both crucial and delicate. Perhaps his orher most important role is to transmit confidence, inducing a spirit ofcourageous exploration, so that participants dare to go as deeply as possibleinto their experiences. They should trust that the facilitator is able to handleany situation that may arise. In the rituals of syncretic religiousorganizations, the entire setting is very supportive. Religious leaders usuallyhave many years of experience leading rituals, and participants either sit orstand and the lights remain on. Sessions conducted the Amazonian way, in thedark, are much more demanding. Theory cannot substitute for experience in leading these sessions, and can beacquired only through guided practice. Conducting an ayahuasca session is amatter of great responsibility. The facilitator, shaman, or religious leader,who normally also takes the brew, must be able to function under its influenceand be available when needed—what vegetalistas call dominar la mareación (tohave control over the inebriated state). In traditional and religious settings,the ritual leader always takes the brew. This seems also to be the case amongcontemporary ayahuasqueros. It is essential, then, that the person facilitatingthe session have the ability to function effectively under the effects ofayahuasca, and that he or she be able to tackle whatever situation comes upduring a session. It is important to note that when leading a ritual,experiencing the effects of the brew is not equal to impairment; under theinfluence of the brew, an experienced person seems to be in touch with somehigher source of knowledge, a higher self, or a transpersonal power and mayperceive, think, speak, and act differently and more effectively, as if an innervoice was speaking through him or her. Something similar may be observed amongsome leaders of religious organizations who are often very eloquent under theinfluence of ayahuasca, even if they have only a modest educational background. On the other hand, caution is also important. Ayahuasca is a powerful substance,and people who take it often have deep and meaningful experiences. Becauseparticipants in a session are usually grateful to the person who facilitates theexperience, there is a potential for abuse—some may use the sacrament only as ameans to obtain material gain or even sexual favors. It is advisable not toplace too much emphasis on the particular person who happens to facilitate theexperience, thus avoiding altogether the creation of cult leaders and the trapsof power. Perhaps the greatest danger in this path of knowledge is egoinflation. Humility seems to be essential to any leadership progress. Intraditional societies, ayahuasca is considered to be the real teacher; theshaman simply helps the neophyte to deal with the plants. In our time, thenumber of ayahuasca practitioners, indigenous and otherwise, is growing, andeach legitimizes his or her practice in various ways. Such phenomena asprojection and transference are quite common. Ethical standards similar to thoseused in psychiatric and psychological practice should be in place.Unfortunately, the current legal situation does not permit an open discussion ofthese issues. It is usually beneficial to have as clear an intention as possible or to pose aspecific question or questions before the session. Thoughts and wishes during anayahuasca ritual seem to be highly operative in a mysterious way. The Shuar, ofthe Ecuadorian Amazon, believe that we take ayahuasca not “to see the future,”but “to create the future.” A strongly felt intention may set the course of theexperience. Most people approaching the ayahuasca experience are usually respectful,regardless of their cultural background; such is the reputation of the brew.Here are some statements recorded during fieldwork among educated Westernersfrom many countries and religious backgrounds when asked why they were takingayahuasca: * “To look at approaching my life in a different way.” * “I am experiencing some health issues and need guidance.” * “I am looking to explore my creative side at a deeper level.” * “I want to take ayahuasca for personal growth and psychological insight—that is, through deep inner explorations, I may learn more about myself, my capabilities, potential, and the best path or way to live.” * “I have some blockages, and I want to have courage to look at that.” * “I want to gain some clarity in those areas of my personality that are obscure for me.” * “I want to work through my destructive thought patterns.” * “I want to see visions that may help me in my healing process.” * “I want to recover my true essence, before [I experienced] any trauma.” * “I want ayahuasca to help me to become as good a therapist as possible.” * “I want to continue working with the spirits.” * “I want to reclaim my lost soul, to heal the shame I [have] carried most of my life.” After successive sessions the intentions may become more specific: * “I want to go deeper. I just want to accept whatever comes.” * “I want to let go, not to be in control.” * “I want to learn where my anxiety comes from.” * “I want to explore more of what I was experiencing last night.” Many people take ayahuasca for personal healing; spiritual uplift;enlightenment; insight and inner peace; connection or union with the cosmicconsciousness, nature, or planet Earth; or to find creative energy. Others takeit “just to know.” There is great variety in ayahuasca experiences. A common theme is contact withalien entities that may take many shapes or the visitation to alien and, attimes, highly technological worlds. Representations of such worlds are found inthe work of Peruvian painter Pablo Amaringo, who paints the ayahuasca visions hehad when practicing as an ayahuasquero.2 [index_split_017.html#filepos841194]Here is the transcript of an abduction experienced by a fortyfive-year-oldAmerican male during an ayahuasca journey. > On April 4, 2007, I was abducted . . . I think. I say I think because when I> think about the experience, I find it all so hard to believe. I have read> about other people’s abduction experiences and thought to myself, “[T]hese> people must be looking for attention, or are nuts, it all sounds so> fantastic.” I am a mechanical engineer.

It took place on another level. > Several years ago, I had a NDE—near death experience—in which a tunnel opened> up and started to draw me in, like a vacuum hose sucking up a bug. Needless to> say I held on and did not get sucked up, but I was intrigued! After that> life-changing experience, I did some research into what enabled that suction> tunnel to appear. In my research, I found that the pineal gland that resides> in the brain may produce dimethyltryptamine, a powerful psychoactive compound> that, when a person is dying, may be secreted directly into the brain.

An hour> later I found myself in a deep meditative state searching for the answers to> my place in the universe. All of sudden, I was bathed in this white light from> above, it felt like antigravity energy that lifted me up and out of my bed,> and through the roof. This white energy beam was cylindrical and seemed like> it had a diameter of 5 to 7 feet and reached up into the night sky. It seemed> to separate me in two and lift an ethereal duplicate of my body. I tried to> analyze the experience. As I was lifted up I could still see the other half of> me still lying down in my bed. I felt that certain parts of my essence, a> hologram of my body, and an impression of my mind and most of my consciousness> was being pulled up. It felt good to be weightless and floating up, although I> could still feel gravity. I was transported into a room within a ship, very> clean, very sterile, well maintained, stainless steel and white, very muted> white lighting, full spectrum. I was on a table, the kind of table you would> see in the morgue because it was like a shallow tub and it had drains and a> hose to wash it down. But it had cushioning, so I got the impression from the> cushioning that I was not there just to be dissected, because there was some> semblance of comfort that was provided. Nevertheless I was strapped down by> the arms and legs, I don’t think my chest was. Right away I felt that my> consciousness was being sedated, but whatever it was that was sedating me was> not enough. I immediately became conscious of my surroundings and tried to sit> up and look around; at that point I became acutely aware of these beings—tall,> skinny, kind of lanky, very thin-featured but with a praying mantis head,> triangular and very bug like. I got the feeling they were very conscious and> technologically advanced. The air conditioning in the space felt just right, I> could hear the sound of a steady hum. The hum of a ship, structurally strong> yet hollow-sounding, vibrating with energy. > Around me, around this table were instruments, tools of some kind, probes,> strange manipulating instruments. They were hanging from the ceiling and some> were attached to the walls. It wasn’t a square room by any means, it seemed> almost round and cylindrical and there were counters around the edge with a> white muted light that seemed very full spectrum almost like shaded windows of> some kind, but it seemed artificial, piped in. It was very relaxing and it had> a soothing frequency to it. This hum seemed to manipulate and soothe me; it> may not have been the sound of the ship, but possibly some kind of acoustic> energy that permeated me in my mind. Somehow, with enough effort and> concentration, I was able to overcome it. At some point they started adjusting> the instruments and moving closer with them. I felt a little fearful but they> assured me that it would be OK, and I responded with, “Look, I feel captive,> and when a human feels captive, they have the innate feeling of the> possibility of being raped or sexually violated. If it’s a male, through his> anus, or a female, through her vagina, and I think that for a woman, it’s even> worse, because if an unwanted seed is implanted in her, it could mean carrying> an unwanted baby. Worse yet, a part-alien baby.” They seemed to just look at> me in astonishment that I was trying to sit up and communicate with them. I> further stated: “This is a give and take, if you need something, you are> welcome to it, but as long as I’m undamaged and I leave this place intact and> whole, just as I came or better, things will be OK. I don’t want to break out> of this state and wreck the place.” After my statement, they seemed to be in a> rush and quickly plunged these probes into my chest. I am not quite sure if> they inserted devices or not. I get the feeling they were just looking and> checking and taking some small biopsies and some blood and sperm and samples> from my gut and bacteria that were in my body. Every time I felt uneasy, they> somehow seemed to soothe my brain and told me to “relax” and that “it’s going> to be OK.” As they were working on me, I forced myself back to> semiconsciousness and looked around. It was very, very clean and sterile and> well maintained. Everything just seemed shiny and spotless. After seeing how> well maintained the room was, I felt comfortable there, yet apprehensive about> what they were doing. At some point, a dog started barking back where my real> body was (I thought it was interesting that I could still hear what my> original body was experiencing), and I said, “I have to go.” They said, “OK,”> and my chest was closed up and I said goodbye. I was quickly transported back> to my bed and merged back with my self. > That ship took off and it seemed like another one immediately, very quickly> assumed a position over the house and transported me up, somewhat violently> and quickly. It was not a very comfortable ride up. I woke up on a dirty> table; again it looked like a morgue table, but dirty and unsanitary. They had> devices all around the table, and they were also a little dirty. They> immediately started plunging instruments into my chest and clamping things> around my organs, cylindrical metallic devices that they clamped around my> aorta and my kidneys and my liver and my intestines and my spine. I’m not> quite sure about my spine. I got the sense of something around my neck, like a> collar. . . . Anyway, I forced myself into consciousness. They had a very> sharp, piercing auditory energy, which was somewhat painful, that seemed to> try to push me back into unconsciousness. I fought it and willed up a burst of> energy that felt as if I had burst out of my body. I looked at them when I> came out of my body. I looked around, and pulled up very quickly and hard on> the restraints. Later, when I woke up, I had a bruise on my arm, and I don’t> remember bruising it in any way that week. That sound forced be back to> semi-consciousness and they plunged the things into me. It was very scary and> painful. I felt like I was totally out of control. They did seem to stay away> from my anus. I remember somehow conveying to them “You know, if you do> something bad to me, things are not going to be good for you; it’s going to> get violent in this ship, and you will be discovered. I will wreck this place> and I don’t care what kind of restraints you have. It’s not going to be a good> situation for you.” (Or me for that matter.) I felt that it could end up being> a fight to my physical death. I looked at them, they looked reptilian with> elephant-like, tough grey skin, with very little hair, the few hairs they did> have were thick (they may have not been hairs at all but feelers like cats> whiskers or the hairs of a bug). They had large eyes like an elephant’s eyes.> Their consciousness felt very reptilian with almost instinctual kind of> thinking and quick communications. They stood [3.5 to 4.5 feet]; they had> little arms and a large round cylindrical body with webbed feet with little> claws. The closest thing I can relate them to is “Cousin Itt.” (Cousin Itt was> an alienlike caricature in a television show from the 1960s called the Addams> Family. Cousin Itt was about three feet tall and was covered from head to toe> with long hair. Cousin Itt spoke in a high-pitched squeal of gibberish that> only the Addams family members understood.) They seemed to be able to move> rather quickly and had a good amount of strength. I remember thinking:> obviously they have been around longer than we have because they’ve got this> technology and this ship, but they really should clean it up and maintain it> better. And try and work with us rather than forcefully taking from us. > At some point it seemed like another presence was coming near, and they zapped> me back to my bed. As soon as I was back, I was gently lifted again, it seemed> like their ship left and another ship assumed their position over the house. I> was lifted up into the other ship very gently, fluidly, smoothly, nicely and> placed in a very comfortable bed without restraints and a nice pillow. I> looked around and saw beings. They were a little scary, about seven feet tall> with candelabra octopus-heads with what seemed like vast brains spread out> within this large head. Kind of compartmentalized. At some point I felt three> brains but I am not sure. One part of the brain was communicating, another> part was taking care of bodily physical functions and another part was> thinking and communicating with the other beings. A very spread-out brain> situation. They had very strange, almost octopus-like heads with tentacles> coming out of their head. But they had arms too; I think large very strong> arms. I felt that I did not want to end up in a physical confrontation with> them. It felt like they were gently probing into my chest and repairing the> sloppy work the previous aliens had done, and were cleaning me up. However,> they did not try to remove the devices. They seemed very understanding of my> discomfort with the devices that the other aliens put in me, but indicated> that they would not be taking them out. I looked around the ship, and noticed> different colors. It wasn’t as white as the first ship, or as dark and> depressing as the second. It was cheerful, but very sophisticated in its> depth. These beings were friendly. I indicated that I wanted to come out of my> semi-consciousness state and meet them at a fully conscious level. They said,> “Not yet; you’re almost there; soon,” almost like an invitation, like it was> going to happen soon, maybe on my next voyage. > I’d like to meet those beings again. We can learn a lot from them. They have> been around a long time. I’m not quite sure if they were from another> dimension, but they certainly know how to travel. I got the sense that they> have traveled far and for a long time. I indicated that I was getting the> feeling that it was time for me to go, so they gently transported me back and> I felt at peace. Although I wasn’t happy about the implants, I felt that there> was a resolution coming. DOSAGE In indigenous ceremonies as well as in ceremonies conducted by mestizopractitioners, it is the shaman who decides the dose (often a standard small cupor bowl is used). It is a common complaint by Westerners who visit the Amazonregion that vegetalistas often under-dose them, perhaps to avoid difficultsituations with foreigners who do not speak Spanish. The potency of the brew maydiffer greatly from shaman to shaman. There is also variation in the brew usedby Brazilian syncretic religious organizations. If the set and setting areappropriate, it is best to take a strong dose—between 80 and 100 ml—of awell-prepared brew. The facilitator should, of course, be familiar with thepotency of the brew in order to advise participants. In general, it is best notto be too conservative. An under-dose may bring all the undesirable effects ofnausea and diarrhea and none of the transcendental ones. Ayahuasca is nottoxic—the lethal dose is around 6 liters, an amount impossible to drink withoutvomiting. Once participants are familiar with the strength of the brew, they should decidefor themselves how much to take in subsequent sessions, increasing or decreasingthe dose depending on their previous experience. After two or three sessions,participants usually know the optimal amount they can take. The facilitatorshould always be alert, however, because sometimes participants are too eager tohave a strong experience and underestimate the potency of the brew. Participantsmust try to keep the brew in the stomach for at least one hour in order for theactive components to have time to be absorbed fully. Body weight is a factor tobe considered, although often it does not seem crucial, because people havedifferent sensitivities to the brew. After about one and a half hours,participants may take a small booster. Slow metabolizers must be aware that theyrequire a longer time to feel the effects; they should therefore wait longerbefore taking a booster. In rare cases a participant does not feel any effectseven after repeated ingestion attempts, probably due to his or her metabolicprocesses. In addition, some people resist the experience altogether and areable to minimize it. Normally, though, a sufficient dose of ayahuasca is enoughto produce powerful effects in most people. DARKNESS AND STILLNESS Among indigenous groups, there are roughly two models of ayahuasca ceremonies:collective ones, which take place in large, communal houses or malocas, wherethe space is illuminated by torches and there are dances to the sound of flutes,rattles, and other musical instruments; and private ones, which are shamanic innature and are conducted in the dark. The mestizo riverine tradition follows thelatter model, though in the Brazilian syncretic rituals, the temples are alwaysilluminated. Darkness, however, strengthens the experience and minimizesdistraction so that participants can turn toward their inner world. Incontemporary indigenous and mestizo shamanic settings, near total darkness is arequirement. Stillness also enhances the journey within. In traditional Amazonian settings,participants sit with their backs straight, but it is also possible to lie down,keeping the spine straight. Stillness is essential, especially during the hoursin which the brew is most potent. Any movement—even movement of the eyes—and anyword pronounced in the ritual space may sidetrack participants from theirjourney. Focus on the forehead, between the eyebrows, helps greatly innavigation. Geometrical patterns often appear in front of the inner eye. Byusing intention, it is possible to enter these patterns and see athree-dimensional or even four-dimensional space of unfathomable beauty. Aparticipant should breath deeply and slowly and find a state of inner peace,especially when encountering difficult situations during the journey. MUSIC When used wisely, music can be an extraordinary navigational tool. Among theCubeo, Makuna, Barasana, and other Tukanoan indigenous groups of the Vaupesregion in Colombia, session participants tie rattles around their ankles andplay panpipes or trumpets. Shuar shamans in the Ecuadorian Amazon may play atumánk (a Jew’s harp) or a kitiár, a two-string violin. In the mestizotradition, the shaman sings throughout the session, often accompanied by arattle made of leaves of a plant (Pariana spp.), with some breaks from time totime. Peruvian mestizo ayahuasqueros call these power songs icaros, and they saythey receive them from the spirits of the plants during their initiation period.The number, variety, beauty, and at times complexity of the icaros are a sign ofpower or efficacy in the work of indigenous and mestizo shamans. Participants inthe sessions often report that icaros have an influence in their visions or havehealing properties by themselves. Among the Shipibo-Conibo of the Ucayali River,in the Peruvian Amazon region, the songs sung during the session are visualizedas quenés, the complex geometrical figures women use in their ceramics,textiles, and body painting.3 [index_split_017.html#filepos841474] Music has a marked effect on ayahuasca experiences and plays a role in shapingthe general mood of a ritual. During a session, contemporary non-Amazonianrituals may make use of a wide range of recorded music, from traditional icarosto world music, classical, folk, vocal, instrumental, electronic, and so forth,with each type of music being conducive to different emotional states. Duringthe ayahuasca experience, participants often have a heightened perception ofmusic and are very susceptible to its influence. It may be that participantsexperience particular music as greatly healing. Some may experience interestingsynchronicities involving a specific musical track that correspond to importantmoments in their subjective experience. It is sometimes interesting to use musicthat is culturally relevant for a specific group—for example, songs that werepopular during certain periods of their lives, folk songs, or even children’ssongs that may evoke childhood memories. A certain melody may touch an innerchord, eliciting a torrent of emotions. Sometimes, participants experiencecertain music as particularly horrible. It is useful to study these emotions,because they may evoke inner states, memories, or associations that are rich incontent. During ayahuasca sessions, participants are especially open to experiencingmusic that they might not pay attention to or might dismiss as too far fromtheir personal taste under usual circumstances. Through music it is possible totravel in time as well as in space. In this respect, tribal ethnic music may beespecially evocative; it may allow for experiencing the extraordinary culturaldiversity still existing in the world. At some point, usually after several hours, dance music may be introducedgradually as a means to evoke a mood of celebration. It can even be therapeuticin itself, after the hard work of earlier hours. People may experience enormousjoy, a release of tension. Through the movement of dance, participants may beable to express inner processes. Further, although it may seem far fromtraditional, dancing is an integral part of the great communal ceremonies of theShuar and Cubeo as reported by Rafael Karsten and Irving Goldman. Dance is alsoan integral part of some of the rituals of the Santo Daime and Barquinhasyncretic religious organizations. Regarding the use of music throughout the session, every ritual and group hasits own dynamic that must be respected. The ritual leader should be sensitive tothe particular mood of each session, so as to harmonize with it while at thesame time gently leading it through the choice of music. Today, through computerprograms such as iTunes, it is easy to select the tracks to be played in anysession in a way that is far less noisy and distracting than working withmultiple compact discs. Finally, the presence of the ritual leader can be made manifest by means of arattle, drum, or other instrument that serves as a sort of Ariadne’s thread forgrateful participants so that they can feel there is somebody present who iswatching over them in case the journey becomes difficult. It is important to remember, too, that periods of complete silence are oftenvery special. In addition, participants may sing either one after the other orsimultaneously, according to an agreed-upon ritual, or they may hum gently. As agrounding tool in difficult situations, it may help to use a rattle. Of course,the possibilities are endless. AYAHUASCA’S PHYSICALITY As with other psychointegrator agents, the strong physical effects of ayahauscaare notable. Vomiting and diarrhea often occur, especially during the firstsessions. Some people even spend hours retching or having dry heaves. Other feelsuch weakness that they are almost unable to get up to go to the toilet or evenask for help. Some people experience waves of hot and cold flashes. In theinitial phase of the journey, blood pressure may go down. Rarely, a personfaints altogether for a few seconds. On occasion, some people have tachycardia;a strong heart and a properly functioning liver are necessary for any who embarkupon the ayahuasca experience. It is advisable that participants receive amedical checkup before repetitive sessions. It is important to note, however,that after several sessions, participants usually become accustomed to the brewand either do not throw up at all or do so without much fuss. The facilitator must take all these possibilities into account, checkingparticipants often to be sure that everything is going well. It is advisable tohave some salt at hand to help restore blood pressure, as well as water, becauseafter several episodes of vomiting and diarrhea, it is important to drink toprevent dehydration. People should also be warned that the effects of ayahuascaoften come in waves; they should not leave the ritual space before they are surethe effects have completely passed and before they have consulted with thefacilitator. It is also best to ask novice participants not to lock the doorfrom inside when they go to the toilet in case they need help and are unable tounlock it themselves. Participants should be instructed to ease themselves downto the floor at any sign of losing consciousness to avoid hurting themselves. Inaddition, during the session, some people have cramps, shake, or feel pain invarious parts of the body, usually those parts that need healing. All these symptoms that may appear dreadful are in fact a blessing; they adddepth to the experience. The emetic and cathartic properties of ayahuasca may beassociated with an inner cleansing process by which participants can ridthemselves of bad habits, negative emotions, traumas, and so on. Ayahuasca mayindeed be a detoxifying agent. After a series of sessions, one woman found thather blood levels of mercury poisoning had decreased drastically. When thesession is over, participants very often report that they feel purified. Thisadds to the next morning’s feeling of inner peace and clarity. FEAR Ayahuasca produces a profound modification of consciousness. Sessions may bedramatic for beginners and at times even for people with a degree of experience,as we can never be sure what will arise. An individual may undergo changes inbody perception—such as transformation into an animal—or may have an out-of-bodyexperience. Similarly, the visions participants experience may have terrifyingcontent—individuals may even relive traumatic experiences—which are augmented bythe physical reactions produced by ayahuasca. Some participants speak inseemingly strange languages (glossolalia); others are convinced that they aregoing to die and may undergo some kind of symbolic death or encounter apparentlymalevolent entities or monsters that threaten to devour them or experience beingdismembered or disintegrated into countless pieces. Some people think they arebecoming mad and that their mind is going around and around in a loop that seemsto have no beginning and no end. Others see extraordinary landscapes, strangecities that are simultaneously ancient and futuristic, or realms of beautybeyond description. They may meet benevolent entities of many kinds orexperience great adventures in strange realms or see themselves at past stagesin their lives. Some even claim to experience their past lives. Before a session, participants should be prepared to travel not only toineffable, beautiful worlds but also to enter the shadows, to see the dark sideof themselves. Often the worst experiences are the best ones. By going to theedge, people are confronted with their innermost fears, and therefore have achance to be aware of them and perhaps resolve them. As one of the leaders of asyncretic Brazilian religious organization commented: “Taking ayahuasca is likegoing down into the cellar with a torch.” A session participant once said thattaking ayahuasca is like digging into the archaeology of the mind. If participants have been properly prepared, they usually are able to deal withtheir fear, and they can surrender to the experience. Resistance often makesthings worse. It is best to face fears—even give them a name—for when fearbecomes more concrete, it is easier to handle. The emetic and catharticproperties of ayahuasca may be interpreted and experienced as some sort ofdetoxification in which participants dispose of physical and psychologicalproblems. Many people report experiencing a kind of cleansing or rebirth afterdifficult situations during a session. We may say that the deeper a personenters into the experience, the richer are its benefits. Despite preparation, however, some people are not able to deal with the fear orbody symptoms they experience. It is crucially important that they receiveproper and gentle but not intrusive help. Every facilitator develops his or herown ways of doing this. One way that some facilitators deal with a participant’sinordinate anxiety is to place a thumb lightly between the eyes of theparticipant and the middle finger of the other hand in the participant’s solarplexus. The participant is then invited to breathe deeply and slowly,concentrating all attention on this breathing activity. During this breathing,the facilitator hums, maintaining the tone as long as possible. This simpleprocedure has a remarkably calming effect: gradually, participants maysynchronize their breathing with that of the facilitator or even hum with theleader. The finger in the solar plexus serves to monitor the heartbeat, thedepth and intensity of breathing, and any possible bowel movement. After a fewminutes of this, most people regain their confidence: Their breathing slows andtheir heartbeat returns to normal. When participants sigh deeply a few times, itis a sign that they are recovering their peace. When an individual has regainedcalm, a facilitator may ask whether he or she can cease attendance. Some people have difficulty asking for help—indeed, asking for help may beexperienced as a kind of healing in itself—or they may be too weak or terrifiedto do so. Because of this, the facilitator must be attentive and check thateverybody is well. If they are thoroughly prepared in terms of what they mayexperience, however, most participants go through it without much drama. In thisrespect, most sessions are uneventful. VISIONS, SYNESTHESIA, AND OTHER PHENOMENA Though in general terms the ayahuasca experience has been charted,4[index_split_017.html#filepos841745] as has been noted, the outcome of eachparticular session is rather unpredictable, even when the same person takes thesame dose in successive sessions and the setting remains the same.Interestingly, participants often experience reverse tolerance: Effects tend tobe stronger when several sessions take place within a few days. This isespecially the case when the traditional dietary restrictions of salt, sugar,and alcohol are observed. With either opened or closed eyes, participants have reported seeing visions ofbeauty and complexity impossible to describe and uniformly sharp. At times,these may appear as more real than normal reality. These strong aestheticfeelings are enormously uplifting, liberating, and therapeutic. Synestheticexperiences are frequent, such as auditory hallucinations and tactile sensationsand an array of other possible effects. For participants, it is advisable to beactive within the experience, to remember intentions, and to try to navigatepurposefully within the visions. If, for example, the intention is to try torecall an episode from childhood, in trying to remember their childhood bedroom,they may suddenly be transported to the past. On one occasion, an Argentineanpsychologist was able to recall in detail that she had witnessed the death of agirlfriend when she was about seven years old. Her parents had denied theepisode, calling it a dream, and had told her that her friend had gone to livein another country. She discovered that this repressed memory had an adverseeffect on her life, and she considered this recollection an extraordinarilyhealing event. Sometimes, for instance, participants may “discover” that as achild they were sexually abused by a relative. Some who were unwanted orunplanned children may even experience being in the womb of their mothers. Participants in ayahuasca sessions are often deeply touched emotionally. Manypeople report that an ayahuasca session has been among the most importantexperiences in their lives. People often claim that the ayahuasca experience hasled them to see their lives with new eyes, perhaps, for example, recognizingpreviously unconscious behavioral patterns. Some people feel the urge to get intouch with their partners, parents, or other family members to tell them howmuch they care for them. Others find a new perspective on their place in the webof personal and professional relationships. For still others, the ayahuascaexperience leads to the acknowledgment of a spiritual dimension, to the feelingof connection to the natural world and the totality of existence. As in any other human enterprise, practice helps. Gradually, participants gainconfidence in handling the particular state of consciousness elicited byayahuasca. Some participants are especially gifted and obtain extraordinaryresults even in their first session. Others need more time. In most instances, afew sessions are quite effective, depending on the intention, and it may beyears before the experience is repeated. There are others who pursue this typeof path more assiduously and even decide to undergo serious training. NAVIGATION With some practice, conscious navigation in the ayahuasca state is perfectlypossible. As in normal life, under the influence of ayahuasca, a variety ofobjects are presented to consciousness, and we may choose which ones to payattention to. Some people are more visual than others. For some, the greatesteffects are in auditory perception. For others, the most powerful responsesoccur in the realm of realizations and insights. For visual people, it is possible—although not always—to zoom in to a particulararea of the inner visual field and follow its development. Sometimes, the sceneremains relatively stable. At other times, it changes dramatically. In someinstances, the visual bombardment is such that it becomes a nuisance. Whenparticipating in successive sessions, similar patterns may appear again andagain, but often in new colors. At times the whole scene appears in pure,shining gold—or, even with eyes open, the visual field may be filled with ablack, metallic color. Certain motifs are very common—for instance, thesensation of transformation into a serpent; or feeling a serpent growing insidethe body, at times coming out of the mouth; or the sensation of being devouredby a serpent. Among the Shipibo-Conibo of Peru, a great serpent is believed tobe the mother of all visions, which she keeps in her skin. Very often, peopleexperience these serpents as benevolent teachers or as primordial mothers, as isthe belief among some indigenous groups of the Upper Amazon. INTEGRATION Integration is a crucial part of the ayahuasca ritual. In the morning followinga session, it is important to feel free to write, draw, or meditate. The timefollowing a session is particularly creative for many. Participants almostunfailingly feel well physically; they are liberated, creative, and optimistic,regardless of how hard the night’s session may have been. Some participants maybe deeply shaken by the experience of the night before. A period of organizedsharing is extremely beneficial. For some, this sharing is an opportunity tosomehow clarify their own experiences. At the same time, listening to others speak about their sessions has aremarkably positive effect. It may happen that somebody in the group finds ananswer to a question or a beneficial formulation of his or her own experience inthe utterances of somebody else. For some people, just the act of talking abouttheir experiences and deep feelings helps to release inner tension. Even thephysical struggles of the night before are seen in a totally different light;they often produce more laughter than concern. In such a group, people may havethe courage to speak about intimate matters, past or present wrongdoings, andfuture aspirations. This in turn can resonate with similar feelings orsituations in other people. Some prefer to keep silent—the experience may be tooineffable to describe in words. Of course, there should be the freedom to speakor not about the events of the night before. Recollection varies. Some privileged people are able to experience long,intricate journeys in which they meet entities and have dialogues they canrecall and transmit in detail. More often, participants remember only glimpsesor fragments of what happened during the night. In general, it is advisable towrite down a session’s experience as soon as possible or to consolidateexperiences by relating them to somebody to keep them from fading away rapidly,like a dream. Yet some people feel that trying to put the experience into wordsmakes it somewhat banal, that it is actually ineffable and beyond description.Some people remember only that something important took place, perhaps anencounter with some being or something else they cannot recall—but they mightalso feel that recollection it is not important, that they have somehowassimilated the experience subconsciously. Organized sharing the morning after often reveals common themes that emergedduring a particular session. For example, several participants may find thatthey were dealing with family situations during their session or largerquestions such as the future of our civilization or of our planet. Sessions aretherefore often collective as well as individual journeys. It is surprising to note that many people, during these integrative circles,claim that they received concrete answers to their questions. Manyparticipants—even those new to the experience—spontaneously personify ayahuasca,saying: “The plant told me . . .” They may call the brew “mother ayahuasca” or“grandmother ayahuasca.” Many people seem to develop a relationship with thespirit of ayahuasca—who is almost invariably feminine. Not every experience,however, is memorable—yet it is common to hear participants claim, “[T]heexperience went beyond my expectations” or “[I]t went beyond my wildest dreams.”This is perhaps one of the greatest rewards of the ayahuasca experience:recovering—if it was lost—the sense of the mysterious. Where does all thisinformation come from? Is it inside us? Is it coming from outside sources? Howis it possible that we have access to such novelty and such beauty, to suchsplendor as well as horror? It is typical to spend some time after participatingin a session pondering or writing about what happened or engaging inphilosophical discussions. The feeling of being healed at some level is one of the most common themesraised in the integrative session. Many report invisible hands, beings, orenergies working on the body, exploring it, going through old surgeries,reorganizing internal organs, taking out things, operating with alientechnology, and, in general, healing. There are evident parallels to the work ofthe spirits, as described by Eliade, in various shamanistic traditions.5[index_split_017.html#filepos842017] There are also so many various reports ofphysical healing that it would be difficult to explain them in pharmacologicalterms. Ultimately, the most healing effect is the realization that we are united witheverything. Participants therefore find a deeper meaning to life.Meaninglessness is one of the most prevalent conditions that modern humansexperience, embedded as we are in a scientific paradigm that all too often viewsthe world as pointless. After an ayahuasca session, people may see their livesas a whole and see patterns in their life—and therefore also see meaning.Becoming aware of dimensions beyond the ordinary that enrich this world isconsidered by many to be profoundly healing. It is not surprising that such expanded views of reality make some people moresensitive toward ecological issues. Fieldwork among members of the syncreticBrazilian churches, for example, reveal that many of them decided afterparticipation in rituals to change their professions so that they could workwith natural products or environmental issues. Another remarkable effect of ayahuasca in a proper setting is its capacity toawaken some kind of strong ethical imperative. Many people report becoming awareof their wrongdoings and having the desire to correct their lives. Quite oftenpeople claim that their first ayahuasca experience was the most significantevent in their lives. Such intense experiences, however, do not induce a longingfor repetition. The brew is usually treated as something sacred and is not takencasually or recreationally. After a session, it is common to feel a state of inner peace and clarity, an“afterglow” that may last for days, weeks, or even months— especially if aparticipant gives attention to the inner world through meditation or activitiesconducive to reflection and through following recommendations regarding foodintake, including reducing the consumption of salt, sugar, and fatty food. Infact, a considerable number of people participating in ayahuasca sessions claimthey abandoned sugar altogether or maintained a healthier diet after theirexperience. It is remarkable that ayahuasca works simultaneously at so manylevels involving the body, the mind, and the spirit. Another common result of ayahuasca sessions is enhanced creativity. Some peoplestart to paint again or write or make music. In fact, ayahuasca has a pivotalrole in the artistic and musical manifestations of those indigenous groups thatuse the brew. Indigenous body painting, designs in the communal houses or otherobjects of material culture, songs, and narratives are often thought to havebeen inspired by the yagé people, the animate agents these people’s ancestorscontacted and that they may also encounter on their inner journeys. Ayahuasca also may be particularly effective in the resolution of addictions.Many people within various churches that use ayahuasca claim they abandonedalcohol, tobacco, or heavy cannabis or cocaine use thanks to their experienceswith the brew. The Center for the Rehabilitation of Drug Addicts and theInvestigation of Traditional Medicine, located in Tarapoto, Peru, and under thedirection of French medical doctor Jacques Mabit, specializes in the treatmentof heavy drug use through ayahuasca and other medicinal plants, apparently withexcellent results. SOCIO-INTEGRATION One of the most remarkable effects of ayahuasca use is socio-integrationmanifested in the deep feeling of appreciation participants usually show foreach other—as if each of them was able to perceive the inner self or essence ofthose present at the session. A strong feeling of bonding, almost a tribalfeeling of belonging, is quickly created among participants, especially if theyhave the opportunity to be together during successive sessions. It is notuncommon for a high degree of communication on many levels to continue afterparticipants return to their countries of origin. The use of ayahuasca and other psychointegrator plants probably contributes tosocial cohesion and may be one of the reasons for the maintenance of tribalidentity in healthy societies such as the Shuar of Ecuador, the Barasana ofColombia, and the Shipibo of Peru, allowing them to better cope with the greatchanges brought about through contact with dominant cultures. Social cohesion isalso visible among members of the syncretic Brazilian organizations that useayahuasca as a sacrament, some of whom say their religion is a religião dosentir—a “religion of feeling.” Finding ways to enhance a sense of community isof great importance in our alienated society—even more so if we take intoaccount the imminent global ecological crisis that may engulf even today’sprivileged people in the not-so-distant future. image [images/00003.jpg] Here we have, then, phenomena of which modern science has no good models ortheories. Ayahuasca—like other psychointegrator agents—offers many possibilitiesif it is used in a responsible way. For some, it is a cognitive tool, aninstrument of exploration on the workings of the mind. For religious people, itprovides a new way of feeling convictions and the revelation that whatever ourinterpretation of reality, the mystery always prevails. For the artist, it openshuge vistas of yet-unseen worlds. For the therapist, it can provide new ways ofunderstanding both ourselves and those who seek help. For many people, itoffers, independent from any religion or philosophical orientation, thepossibility of a revision of our path in temporality. "},{"pageContent":"image [images/00004.jpg] 6image [images/00004.jpg] Magic Mushrooms Slawek Wojtowicz, M.D. There are dozens of species of sacred (or magic) hallucinogenic mushroomsbelonging primarily to the genuses Psilocybe, Panaeolus, and Copelandia. Theiringestion produces significant physical, visual, and perceptual changes by meansof their psychoactive compounds, the tryptamine psychedelics psilocin andpsilocybin. Nearly all of the magic mushrooms are small and brown or tan incolor and can easily be mistaken for any number of nonpsychoactive, inedible, orpoisonous mushrooms in the wild. This makes them somewhat difficult to identifyin natural environments and thus potentially hazardous. The primarydistinguishable feature of most psilocybin-containing mushrooms is that theybruise blue when handled. HISTORY Sacred mushrooms have been part of human culture as far back as the earliestrecorded history. Many of these mushroom species grow in cattle dung. Ancientpaintings of humans decorated with mushrooms dating to 5000 BCE have been foundin caves on the Tassili Plateau of northern Algeria. Native Americans in LatinAmerica have also used sacred mushrooms for thousands of years for bothmedicinal and religious purposes. Between 3000 BCE and 1000 BCE these culturesbuilt temples to mushroom gods and created stone icons carved in the shape ofmushrooms, with stems depicting human figures. In the mid-sixteenth century, the Spanish priest Bernardino de Sahagún describedin his Florentine Codex the use of hallucinogenic mushrooms by the Aztecs: > The first thing to be eaten at the feast were small black mushrooms that they> called nanacatl, which bring on drunkenness, hallucinations and even lechery;> they ate these before the dawn . . . with honey; and when they began to feel> the effects, they began to dance, some sang and others wept. . . . When the> drunkenness of the mushrooms had passed, they spoke with one another of the> visions they had seen.1 [index_split_017.html#filepos842388] During the early twentieth century, some Western academics doubted the existenceof psychoactive mushroom cults. Though Sahagún mentioned teonancatl—sacredmushrooms—in his diaries, the American botanist William Safford argued that thepriest had mistaken dried peyote buttons for mushrooms. In the early 1930s,Robert Weitlaner, an Australian amateur anthropologist, witnessed and describeda Mazatec mushroom ceremony (velada) northeast of Oaxaca, Mexico. Little morewas known until the early 1950s, when amateur mycologist Gordon Wasson and hiswife, Valentina Pavlovna, became interested in the traditional use of mushroomsin Mexico. In 1953, Wasson traveled to Huautla de Jimenéz, where he observed anall-night ceremony under the guidance of a shaman named don Aurelio. The couplesoon discovered, however, that even though Native American shamans were willingto let them observe their rituals, they would not share sacred mushrooms withforeigners. Wasson’s lucky break came during two subsequent trips to Mexico,which allowed him to meet the Mazatec curandera Maria Sabina, who on June 19,1955, permitted Wasson and his companions to participate fully in a velada. In1956, one of Wasson’s associates, Roger Heim, requested help from SandozPharmaceuticals in extracting the active ingredients of the mushrooms. AlbertHofmann, a research chemist at Sandoz, isolated psilocybin and psilocin anddeveloped a synthesis technique. Wasson continued to travel to Oaxaca over the next years, and published thefirst widely distributed article about psychoactive mushrooms and the Mazatecvelada in the May 13, 1957, issue of Life magazine. Experimentation began withthe mushrooms and the synthesized active substances, and “magic mushrooms” weresoon part of the psychedelic movement.2, [index_split_017.html#filepos842725] 3,[index_split_017.html#filepos842995] 4 [index_split_017.html#filepos843197]Through the 1960s, mushrooms and their active ingredients were used in the Westrecreationally and therapeutically and as part of new spiritual traditions. In 1968, possession of psilocybin and psilocin became illegal in the UnitedStates, and in 1970 they were added to the new Drug Abuse Prevention and ControlAct, commonly known as the Controlled Substances Act, which came into force in1971. Research into their medicinal uses continued until 1977. Thoughrecreational use continued, scientific research in the United States and Europewas on hold through the 1980s and 1990s due to strict governmental controls. Inrecent years, psilocybin and its effect on the human brain and mind have onceagain become the subject of scientific study. MECHANISM OF ACTION The hallucinogenic effects of magic mushrooms are induced by several alkaloids,primarily psilocybin, psilocin, and baeocystin. Psilocybin is more stable thanpsilocin, but is broken down into psilocin, the most active component of themushroom, after ingestion. These compounds are closely related to DMT. Thechemical formula of psilocin is 4hydroxy-N, N-dimethyl-tryptamine. Psilocin isalso a close relative of the neurotransmitter serotonin, and its resemblance toserotonin is responsible for its psychoactive properties. Psilocin binds to aspecialized type of serotonergic receptor know as the 5-HT2a, where it acts as apartial agonist, stimulating some neurons but not others. It is not clear howthis pharmacological activity translates into the characteristic psychedelicexperience. One hypothesis is that these compounds increase activity of thesensorimotor gating system of the brain, which normally suppresses the majorityof sensory stimuli from conscious awareness. The conscious mind is thereforeoverwhelmed by sensory stimuli and cognitive processes that are normally hiddenin the unconscious part of the mind. SPECTRUM AND DURATION OF PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS Depending on how much and how recently a person has eaten, mushrooms generallytake fifteen to sixty minutes (though sometimes as long as two hours) to takeeffect. These effects last for approximately four to six hours after oraladministration. A high-dose experience with mushrooms appears to be quitesimilar to an experience with DMT but with less intensity, perhaps because ofthe slower onset of effect. Visual and auditory alterations and synesthesia (thecombining of two sensory modalities, such as seeing sounds) are often reported.Also described is a feeling of euphoria and heightened awareness of the innerself, frequently leading to increased insight after the experience. Within minutes after ingestion, mushrooms frequently cause a feeling ofanticipation or anxiety. There may be a feeling of energy in the body, and thesense that things are different from usual. As the effects intensify, a widevariety of perceptual changes may occur: mental stimulation, quickly changingemotions, and in some cases paranoia and confusion. More-advanced users mayexperience expanded spiritual awareness or a sense of universal understanding.Closed-eye visuals are extremely common, though open-eye visuals are more likelyto occur at higher doses. High-dose effects are usually characterized by closed-eye visualizations thatare significantly more elaborate. Users report religious revelations; spiritualawakening; near-death experiences; dissolution of the ego; talking to seeminglyexternal, autonomous entities; extreme emotional responses such as fear and joy;repressed memories or latent psychological crises that come to the surface; anincrease in artistic sense; or intense feelings of wonder. High-dose effects mayalso include extreme time dilation, with the subjective experience of seconds orminutes feeling like hours or days. One of the most interesting effects that maybe experienced by some users is the feeling of awakening for the first time everfrom a previous state of sleep. Paradoxically, it is this new awareness thatfeels normal and natural while any previous existence appears to have beenunreal all along. The person experiencing this effect is convinced that, oncegained, this awareness is impossible to lose, but, inexplicably, by the next dayit is just a memory. The physiological and psychological effects of mushrooms are influenced by thedose and the individual’s sensitivity to psilocybin. For some people, an amountas small as 0.25 g of dry mushrooms can be sufficient for a full visionaryexperience, unpleasant stomach cramps or gas, and other effects usually presentat higher doses. In others, the same amount might not cause any noticeableeffects. More-profound effects are induced with doses that range from 0.75 g to2.5 g of dry mushrooms. This range of doses might induce powerful distortions oftime and space as well as spontaneous, detailed imagery. These effects are oftenmore pronounced in those who have used mushrooms previously. Emotionalsensitivity and an increased ability to focus on emotional problems can raisethe probability of dwelling on a single feeling that may have a negativecontent—and thus can lead to a psychological crisis. At a dose ranging from 2.5 g to 10 g, the user can expect all of the effects ofthe medium dose, but usually with greater intensity and with a significantlygreater likelihood of uncomfortable side effects, which may include pronouncednausea that can result in vomiting and significant mental discomfort associatedwith feelings of fear. These side effects usually lessen as the experiencebecomes familiar to the user. For an unprepared person, however, high doses canlead to acute adverse effects and may produce extreme fear, panic, and evenpsychosis. These psychological effects may share several features with acute,particularly paranoid, schizophrenia. SIDE EFFECTS AND ABUSE POTENTIAL Psilocybin and psilocin have low toxicity. The traditional measure of toxicityof a drug is a therapeutic index: a ratio of the dose that is effective(effective dose, ED) in 50 percent of subjects (ED50) to the lethal dose (LD)that kills 50 percent of subjects (LD50). According to the Registry of ToxicEffects, the therapeutic index for psilocybin is 641 (higher numbers indicate abetter safety profile). Therefore, it is relatively nontoxic in comparison toother substances. For example, the therapeutic index for aspirin is 199; fornicotine, it is 21. The greatest danger in using hallucinogenic mushrooms is an accidental ingestionof other wild mushroom species that look similar to psilocybin-containing onesbut are poisonous. Many wild mushrooms contain toxins that can lead to liver orkidney failure and death. In addition, the hallucinatory effects of magicmushrooms can put people at risk of accidents. Users may indulge in dangerousbehaviors such as walking out in traffic or along railway lines and driving oroperating heavy machinery while under psilocybin influence. The physiological and psychological effects of mushrooms are influenced by boththe dose and the individual’s sensitivity. Physiological side effects are morelikely to occur with higher doses and are usually self-limited, resolving withina few hours after ingestion. Effects most commonly reported are dilation ofpupils, loss of coordination, dizziness, muscular relaxation, coldness of thelimbs and abdomen, flushing of the skin, and a slight increase in bodytemperature. Various blood hormones and liver enzymes can also be elevatedtemporarily. Some less common side effects are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, gas,stomachaches and cramps, shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, increased bloodpressure, and headache. The medical literature reports one case of irregularheart rate (Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome) and heart attack following ingestionof Psilocybe semilanceata, though these serious side effects occurred in a manwith a genetic defect in the electrical wiring of his heart and likely wererelated to the high concentration of phenylethylamine in this particular sampleof mushrooms.5, [index_split_017.html#filepos843428]6,[index_split_017.html#filepos843780]7, [index_split_017.html#filepos844132]8[index_split_017.html#filepos844483] Magic mushrooms and other psychedelics are powerful mental amplifiers and maytrigger latent psychological and mental problems, particularly in individualssuffering from severe depression or anxiety or with a family history ofschizophrenia or any other significant mental illness, specifically psychoses ofthe paranoid type. Little is known about the long-term effects of magic mushroom use, thoughMexican shamans have been using them for centuries. Psychological reactions tomagic mushrooms are frequently affected by set and setting. Set refers to thesubject’s preexisting mind-set and setting refers to the surrounding environmentin which the user experiences a psychedelic’s effects. Recent negativeexperiences can induce serious distress and trauma following exposure topsychedelic substances. Psychological side effects may include anxiety; unwanted, difficult, orfrightening thoughts and visions; anguished introspection; and temporary changesin an individual’s perception of life and reality. Panic and anxiety attacks canoccur, but these usually disappear within twelve hours with support andreassurance. Some depression may occur in the days following the mushroom trip.Occasionally, frightening mental states produced by magic mushrooms can induceflashbacks days or even months afterward and may cause significant psychosocialdistress. These flashbacks are similar to those experienced by people withposttraumatic stress disorder.9, [index_split_017.html#filepos844875]10,[index_split_017.html#filepos845305]11 [index_split_017.html#filepos845558] Mixing mushrooms with intoxicants such as alcohol, marijuana, and street orprescription drugs, particularly MAO inhibitors (MAOIs), may significantlyincrease the potential for these and other adverse reactions. Combining MAOIswith serotonin-enhancing or psychostimulant drugs is unsafe, because a conditioncalled serotonin syndrome may result or a hypertensive crisis may develop due toelevated levels of pressor monoamines in the body. Magic mushrooms do not appear to produce physical dependence, though they doproduce a short period of increased tolerance that lasts for one to two weeksafter use. A literature review comparing twenty commonly used psychoactivesubstances found that oral psilocybin appeared to have the lowest risk ofdependence and acute lethality, and intravenous heroin appeared to have thegreatest.12 [index_split_017.html#filepos845761] SCIENCE-FICTION VISIONS Terence McKenna, one of the pioneers of the psychedelic movement in the West,claimed that magic mushrooms produce exo-pheromones— that is, volatilesubstances that attract intelligent species and induce them to eat the mushroomsin order to speed up their intellectual development. He also claimed that themushrooms revealed to him that they were a gateway to the intergalacticcommunication network.13, [index_split_017.html#filepos846092]14[index_split_017.html#filepos846391] A significant proportion of people using magic mushrooms report spiritual andmystical experiences that are virtually indistinguishable from spontaneousmystical experiences, as confirmed by a recent study conducted at Johns HopkinsUniversity.15 [index_split_017.html#filepos846753] Here is one description,provided by a friend of mine, of what may happen after ingestion of mushroomsduring a journey guided by the shaman: > I went deeper and deeper inside—I traveled through various realms, some of> them beautiful, others magical, and others quite scary. It felt kind of like> being in a computer game, where you have to figure out a way to go from level> to level and there are hidden dangers, distractions, and traps awaiting you> everywhere.

There is no need to suffer or to be unhappy ever> again. This experience turned upside down my views of the world and religion> and changed me profoundly—for better. Other experiences frequently reported after ingestion of magic mushrooms includetime travel (both within a personal time frame and across thousands of yearsinto the past or the future), telepathy and merging with other individuals, anda wide variety of alien encounters and visits to alien worlds. Yet it isdifficult to assess how often the science-fiction-like experiences are inducedwith the help of magic mushrooms, because no systematic research into theseparticular effects has been published. There are a few descriptions of magicmushroom experiences with science-fiction themes, as described on the Erowidwebsite and reprinted here with permission.16[index_split_017.html#filepos847162] A True Hallucination by Mantid (ID: 2077)> . . .

JOAN HALIFAX,SHAMAN: THE WOUNDED HEALER It is my hope that a reader who is not appalled by the word supernatural in thischapter’s title would not mind speculating why the ideas of soul, spirit, andrebirth echo across ages, and why these concepts appear and reappear in widelydifferent cultures. The belief in spiritual forces and otherworldly realmsappears universal in the human species. Rational thinking deems such conceptssuperstitious and originating in illusion or fear of death and representinganxiety over ego-dissolution. It considers them products of wishful thinking.Academic accounts see spiritual practice arising from the functioning of thehuman mind, with its supposed tendency to seek spiritual states or comfort in ahostile world.1 [index_split_017.html#filepos847702]Accordingly, in worshippingspiritual beings, humans are just paying homage to a rarified form ofthemselves. We can see that certain beliefs and experiences crop up universally in spiritualpractices around the world, maintained for millennia. The empiricallyestablished existence of resilient commonalities is remarkable. Regardless, thefact that spiritual teachings and mystical wisdom traditions share a remarkablecross-cultural similarity can be dismissed with a skeptical shrug and explainedaway as projections of intrapsychic structures common in every human being—andthat a misinterpretation of universal experiences, such as dreams, may lead tothe belief in existence of spiritual beings.2[index_split_017.html#filepos847974] There are some elaborate explanations that suggest parallels to a pathologicalcondition. Similar to schizophrenia, which—as some speculate—is a price thehuman race pays for the gift of language,3 [index_split_017.html#filepos848193]the tendency to believe in supernatural beings is common in all humans becauseit is an offshoot of creative imagination. According to this view, somethingmaladaptive resides in us universally and stays with us persistently, because itis closely tied to an adaptive trait—creativity. The most permissive,dispassionate scientific approach accepts universality as sufficient toestablish phenomenological reality, but leaves the question open as to itsontological source.4 [index_split_017.html#filepos848468] Skepticism is valued very highly in Western scientific thinking—as it ought tobe to keep knowledge-building tightly disciplined. Why, then, can we not useskepticism in a self-referential way, from a self-critical point of view? Firstof all, we must be skeptical toward our own cultural background, which has manyhidden presumptions governing even our supposedly objective way of answeringquestions. Setting boundaries is the essence of the scientific method when itisolates and separates systems in order to study them experimentally withoutconfounding interferences from the outside. Where, then, is the boundary of the scientific method itself? If science haslimitations (this will be addressed further in the section about rationalizingand mysticism on page 182, under the heading Educatio Demistificationis—i.e.,demystifying education), then it cannot be the bearer of the ultimate truth.Overvaluation of science, as in scientism, can take the form of culturalarrogance when it attempts to explain why people of different cultures do thingsthe way they do, interpreting costumes and rituals while ignoring a culture’sown reasons behind what it does. My agenda is not to follow cultural relativismblindly. However, I pay maximal respect to the interpretation of aboriginalcultures and will use those as a starting point. COGNITIVE SCHEMAS First, let us examine the soundness of Western confidence in scientism. We cansummarize the basic concepts science holds about the human phenomenon asfollows: * Man is the by-product of mere chance. This follows from the combination of evolution theory and random genetic mutations. There is no divine plan, no Almighty Creator. From the chaotic movements of the material world, complex systems evolved as a result of chance and were chosen by natural selection. * We live in a universe alien to us and ignorant of our destiny. The anthropic principle, either in its “soft” or “strong” form, is not able to come to the rescue of an individual person. The two forms of the anthropic principle diverge in their interpretation as to why the physical constants of our universe predispose it to be hospitable to human life, but agree that the cosmos is absolutely indifferent toward the fate of any one member of the species. * We have come from nothingness and will return to nothingness after death. The meaning of this is the same as the decree “dust to dust.” Only the most basic components of our bodies will survive and continue on in the circle of life. It is apparent to a mind trained in behavioral sciences that these basicconcepts are strikingly similar to the Beck triad: The psychiatrist Aaron Becknoticed the cognitive distortion that depressed subjects perceived in self, theworld, and the future, calling it the negative cognitive schema of depressivethinking. Derogatory views of the self, the world, and the future are corefeatures of the depressed individual: “I am a worthless person.” “The world is an inhospitable place.” “My past is a tragedy; my future is hopeless.” Beck suggested that depressed people draw illogical conclusions aboutsituations, and these lead to a distortion of reality, which manifests in themagnification of negative experiences and the trivialization of neutral orpositive ones. The cognitive triad is the source of the extremely lowself-esteem of depressed subjects. Indeed, it can lead to micromanic (theopposite of grandiose) delusions, manifesting in the extreme form as psychosis.The parallel between the theses of scientism and the Beck triad is close andraises the following questions: Does the same outcome stand for scientificthinking as well? Is scientific thinking illogical or biased in its worldview ina way that is similar to that of a depressed patient? Of course, science is notillogical, but it may suffer from overexclusiveness. It must be biased in thatdirection in order to build a consistent knowledge system by keeping “soft,”poorly validated concepts outside of its domain. Nevertheless, what lies outsideof the semantic universe of “official science” today may be part of it tomorrow.There are more things in heaven and on Earth than are dreamed of in our currentphilosophy. . . . Can the negative thinking of Western rationalism lead to a pathologically flawedunderestimation of the human potential in a manner akin to a psychoticdepressive delusion? A possible answer is hidden in the cognitive schemas ofseven wisdom traditions that can be designated as unambiguously positive: * Christianity: “The kingdom of heaven is within (or among) you” (from the words of Jesus). * Islam: “Those who know themselves know their Lord.” * Judaism: “He is in all, and all is in Him.” * Confucianism: “Those who know their own nature, know heaven.” * Taoism: “In the depths of the soul, one sees the Divine, the One.” * Buddhism: “Look within, you are the Buddha.”5 [index_split_017.html#filepos848833] Apparently, the issue has to do with self-knowledge—yet it is not about theself-knowledge favored by Western individualism: “Be aware of your own copingskills!” Individualism, which has been nurtured in the West, is a culturaltradition of the last two hundred years. The wisdom traditions cited here,however, are at least fourteen hundred years old, and all of them were born inthe East. There is one more, which formulates most concisely the essence of allof them: * Hinduism: “Atman [individual consciousness] and Brahman [universal consciousness] are one.” In other words, if we descend into the depth of our psyche, we will arrive atsomething common in all of us and in everything. We discover this byconsistently looking inward until within becomes beyond. Conversely, if we lookfar and deep into the universe and dare to go beyond, at some point we will facethe observing self. There is no such thing as monotonous, infinite progressionand regression with endless hierarchies, larger and larger supersystems on theway up and smaller and smaller elementary particles on the way down. Quantumphysicists have already stumbled onto the problem of conscious observer, andwere temporarily able to find a way around it in the Copenhagen interpretationof quantum mechanics. image [images/00029.jpg] The great unification, the Theory of Everything, very likely requires betterunderstanding of consciousness as the vehicle through which all things areknown. As physicists struggle to tie together general relativity and quantumfield theory in terms of quantum gravity, perhaps further insights will beobtained by understanding the nature of logic, cognition, and consciousness. Theinside and outside paths will eventually converge in consciousness or in what isknown as source in Sufism, ruach in the kabbalah, aka in kahuna mysticism,dynamic ground in transpersonal psychology, and zero-point energy or topologicalfield among heterodox physicists (see figure 7.1). We may recognize it as theMatrix, the Cosmic Internet. At the deepest level of our psyche, at the bottomof our soul, we become one with the ultimate reality.*6[index_split_016.html#filepos812154]Any—even the last, most unfortunate—memberof the human species carries the whole cosmos inside and has the potential toreach it, to tap in to it. This is exactly what we may realize as the mostpositive cognitive scheme, the most important discovery of all time. This kind of teaching definitely soothes the soul. It would be interesting tofind out whether the prevalence of clinical depression, anxiety disorders, andsuicidal behavior is lower in cultures that nurture these teachings. Regardlessof their positive impact on everyday life, doubts remain: Does spiritual wisdomrepresent wishful thinking? Does it have scientific meaning at all? Does it havea place in our worldview at the beginning of the twenty-first century? If theanswers are negative, then why are no fewer than seven wisdom traditions (anyoneknowledgeable in mystic teachings can add more) so unequivocal in their basictenets? Why do mystics separated by two millennia and two continents achievebetter accord on these issues than two scientists of the modern era on thenature of the universe or on the fact of global warming? It is notable thatthese teachers have never been guilty of theological quarreling or theocraticdictatorship, nor can their teaching be used for these purposes by others. AsAlan Watts summarized: “. . . the plain fact [is] that there has otherwise beena single philosophical consensus of universal extent. It has been held by [menand women] who report the same insights and teach the same essential doctrinewhether living today or six thousand years ago, whether from New Mexico in theFar West or from Japan in the Far East.”6 [index_split_017.html#filepos849042] Foolish, arbitrary thinking can hardly reach this degree of consensus. Notwithout sarcasm, Ken Wilber said: “Eighty-three hallucinating schizophrenicscouldn’t organize a trip to the bathroom, let alone Japanese Zen.”7[index_split_017.html#filepos849312] Wilber refers to the eighty-three followersof Zen master Hakuin as sages with mystical experiences and not schizophrenicsubjects with perceptual distortions. The historically new rational thinking,the triumph of the era of Enlightenment, is an outlier of the wisdom traditionand definitely not of the enlightened one. If the sages are right about mysticalenlightenment, their truth must also be correct in the framework of anotherknowledge system—Western science. The problem lies in finding a proper way oftranslation. The purpose of this chapter is to answer the questions we’ve raised here asscience at present will allow. By doing so, we may cross the ideas of differentworldviews. I am fully aware of the pitfalls of both overinclusiveness andpassionate thinking. Truly, the underlying methodological approach has minimalexperimental support; it can rely only on neurophenomenology, model-making,searching for inconsistencies in rivaling views, and use of the power ofconverging evidence. PHILOSOPHIA PERENNIS The view held by a great majority of eminent theologians, mystic sages, andnonmaterialist philosophers at various times is known as perennial philosophy.8[index_split_017.html#filepos849566] It is perennial because it holds profound,everlasting insights into life and nature, spanning cultures, and has beentaught by the great thinkers of all time. Four crucial claims about reality andhuman nature lie at the heart of perennial wisdom: 1. There are two realms of reality. The physical or phenomenal world is not the only reality; another, nonphysical realm exists, and the two domains together constitute the ultimate reality. 2. All humans partake of both realms and mirror the nature of this two-sided reality. 3. Human beings possess a capacity, however unused and therefore atrophied, for perception of nonphysical reality. 4. Humans can recognize their divine spark (Atman) and the sacred ground (Brahman) that is its source. This perception is the final goal (mystical enlightenment), and its pursuit is the greatest good (holy life) of human existence. All the great messengers of the spirit and the masters of mysticism have declared with one voice that the supreme aim of humanity is reunion with its divine principle.9 [index_split_017.html#filepos849781] Teachings of perennial philosophy suggest that the cosmos is not onlyinterconnected and pulsating with life, but also multilayered. The physicaluniverse is not the only domain; beyond its complex hierarchy, there is also thesubtle realm of spirit, for which the most meaningful contemporary term isprobably consciousness. The spiritual realm cannot be known through the physicalsenses and cannot be measured by scientific instruments. According to followersof perennial philosophy, the realm of spirit can be approached by contemplativemethods such as meditation, rituals, and a sacred way of living.10[index_split_017.html#filepos849989] Moreover, the perennial philosophy statesthat our true nature is spiritual. We are fundamentally creatures (as well ascreators) of this realm. This is nothing less than a superpositive cognitivescheme, and in this chapter we attempt to bring it into a rational context inthe hope of changing the contemporary scientific worldview into one that is lessnegative. For clinical practitioners and suffering patients, the message is thatthere is no tragedy in being human. The problem, rather, is that people who havebeen severed from spiritual roots see life as a disaster. THE SPIRITUAL DIMENSION As an anchoring point and clarification, here is a definition of spirituality:It is something that we may not perceive, but others can—and this kind ofexperience enriches those who undergo it. This is a relatively cautiousapproach; even people with an aversion to New Age, esoteric thinking may acceptit. The Institute of Noetic Sciences found in a survey that about 75 percent ofthe population had at least one spiritual experience in life, but 75 percent ofindividuals employed in health care and those with strong academic backgroundshad no such experience. This revealed divergence calls for a second study toreplicate these results, and must be a wake-up call for these professionals. Human thinking has different forms—rational thinking, emotional thinking, andspiritual thinking—and each of them can be measured by IQ tests developed byDavid Wechsler, Daniel Goleman, and Robert Emmons, respectively. An individualcan score high on one or more or even all of them. In the film Forrest Gump, TomHanks plays a character who might definitely score low on the first test(rational thinking) but higher on the others. John Coffey of the The Green Mileprobably has a high spiritual IQ, but expresses modest capacity in the otherareas. In corporate and governmental America, some might make a rich career witha high Wechsler IQ (rational thinking) score, but these institutions make highemotional and spiritual intelligence disadvantageous for a career-seekingindividual. It is essential in the current codes of professional behavior to sort outemotional and spiritual feelings and to suppress them (“Don’t mix business withfriendship”). There is a recent trend in business management to promoteemotional and spiritual intelligence to manipulate others, which isself-contradictory. Even in mental health care the basic tenet is to maintainboundaries: “Stay objective, stay away, and don’t take your patients home!”Compassion toward patients is tolerated, perhaps, but is not consideredprofessional. This can cause problems in health care, however, because millenniaof history in the healing traditions indicate that to be effective, a trulyauthentic healer mobilizes her or his potentials in the emotional and spiritualspheres as well as in the logical sphere. To be an opportunist, then, we can besatisfied with our rational IQ, but to perform well and to everyone’ssatisfaction in the health care business, we must score high in all three areas. THE EXTENDED BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL PARADIGM Contemporary medicine defines human beings in a biopsychosocial framework. Theconcept of patients as biopsychosocial entities goes back to George Engel,11[index_split_017.html#filepos850227] and comes from the observation that thereare ailments that cannot be treated successfully by biological means alone.There are mental disturbances for which targeting the intrapsychic conflictsalone (e.g., as in classical psychoanalysis) is not enough—the therapist mustaddress the subject’s interpersonal relationships as well (perhaps in the formof family therapy). Involving higher levels of the biopsychosocial pyramid inhealth care may result in permanent improvement, and palliative, symptom-focusedtherapy can then be replaced by curative treatment. The biopsychosocial paradigm is not complete, however. Something is missing fromthe top that would provide for a transformation into a mighty pyramid: theall-seeing eye (like that staring on the back of a dollar bill), the symbol ofspirituality (see figure 7.2). There are anthropological observations, Orientaldescriptions, and Western anecdotal reports about successful therapiesincorporating spiritual elements. We must realize that the top of the pyramid isunsteady without a solid layer at the base. Likewise, the pyramid is just animpressive pile of rock without a radiant capstone at the top. On the one hand,a treatment should not be based solely on spiritual techniques; on the otherhand, treatments with somatic focus are mostly palliative in Western medicine. Here, we arrived at a modified, extended paradigm: the biopsychosociospiritualmodel. Therapy sui generis is reintegration in toto on biological, mental,social, and spiritual levels. Thus far, there is nothing mystical in adding thespiritual to the concept: moving from left to right (from bio to spiritual)along the gradations comprising the awkward term biopsychopsociospiritual meansthat the individual would identify step by step with higher realms ofreality—with the psyche, with the community, and, at the end, with an entityabove community (i.e., environment, nature, universe, Mother Earth, or otherentities depending on culturally determined worldviews). Meaning emerges fromcontext; more purpose can be acquired from higher hierarchical perspectives.Consequently, spiritual orientation can provide a more meaningful life toindividuals than does solely pursuing materialistic goals or followingfundamentalistic views that bluntly ignore the value system of others. image [images/00030.jpg] The term sacred refers to a sense of respect for and humility toward the largerentities to which we are subordinated and that govern our lives. Based on theillusion that we are in command of our destiny, Western individualism has erodedthis concept. The historical process of individualization involves slicing off,step by step from right to left, components of the biopsychosociospiritualunity. This process was begun millennia ago by gradual separation from natureand by the suppression of tribal ritual traditions. It continued duringmodernization by the destruction of rural communities and the rise of thenuclear family, and has culminated in postmodern, emotionless professionalism.The richness of the biopsychosociospiritual model of traditional societies hasbeen boiled down to the bony biorobot rationalis skeleton of postmodern man. Indeed, cross-cultural analyses reveal that increasing social and politicalcomplexity, particularly hierarchical integration, leads to a reduction in theuse of spiritual techniques.12 [index_split_017.html#filepos850481] Thisnegative—at times, antagonistic—relation to political integration reflects aninherent conflict between spirit and power: the psychosocial needs ofhierarchical societies are not compatible with the individuals’ directrelationship to a transcendental “other,” especially not in an altered state ofconsciousness (ASC). Dobkin de Rios and Smith13[index_split_017.html#filepos850885] suggest that spiritual techniques foraltering consciousness are typically repressed in state-level societies becausethey constitute a potential threat to the religious interpretations of those whohold social and religious power. In our complex, hierarchical society, addressing the biopsychosociospiritualtotality is not tolerated on the level of direct personal experience, but ispromoted in a symbolic form, as reflected by the familiar text of the prayerknown as the “Our Father”: Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy willbe done, on Earth as it is in heaven. [Surrender to the spiritual force is formulated; the virtue of humility isimplied.] Give us this day our daily bread. [The basic, biological needs of the body are to be taken care of, withmoderation.] And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. [Here is the submission to social values and the concern for others withexpression of the need for fairness.] And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. [This is a request for the body’s capitulation to the psyche. It calls fortemperance, for denial of pursuing only hedonistic or material goals.] Amen. [Let it be.] Could it be expressed more concisely? In this prayer, we find that anyone whowishes to do so can address all four elements of the biopsychosociospiritualparadigm within thirty seconds. CHANGING VIEWS ON THE SHAMAN’S MISSION: PSYCHOINTEGRATION AND DIVINATION In the course of recent studies in psychological anthropology, a consensus hasemerged that the vast majority of ritual ceremonies are concerned primarily withhealing in a general sense. They exert influence on physical well-being,heighten identity, enhance interpersonal cohesion, reintegrate community intothe environment, and mitigate perceived conflicts with supernatural powers. Inspite of the cultural diversity of therapeutic institutions and practices, thefundamental healing principles show a good deal of cross-cultural uniformity.Michael Winkelman emphasizes the traditional healer’s role in the reintegrativeprocess, and coins the term psychointegration as a description of the healingprocess.14 [index_split_017.html#filepos851160] All traditional shamanic rituals pursue the same end: to destroy “profane”sensibility and create a sensory condition that is open to the supernatural.This is not only a matter of physiological techniques. Traditional ideologydirects and imparts values to all these efforts intended to break the frame ofprofane sensibility. The result is an ASC: an ecstasy or trance, which is notthe goal but rather the means of contacting spiritual realms in archaic healingceremonies. Mircea Eliade defines the technique of ecstasy as the commondenominator of all shamanic practices.15 [index_split_017.html#filepos851407]According to his view, the shaman is a skilled technician, a manipulator of theASC of all participants, including that of him-or herself, an experiencednavigator of spiritual realms as revealed in the shamanic journey. Over the past decade it has become increasingly clear that though trancetechniques are important, there are cultures in which there are exceptions. Moreuniversal is the shaman’s function in the role of a communicator: the shaman isthe traditional healer who encounters divine entities and spirits in order tofulfill his therapeutic obligation. This is psychointegration in the broadestsense. Integration, which is reintegration in the case of healing, meansnecessarily bringing information into the disintegrated system through a processknown as divination. We arrive, then, at a new definition of the shaman’s mission: to act asmessenger of divine information in the service of the community. Despitemillennia of field testing, divination has no scientific validation. It mayreach epistemological acceptance at best without ontological recognition.16[index_split_017.html#filepos851642] Ignorance is more common from a scientificstandpoint, due to lack of controlled observations—the result of academicindifference, it is extremely difficult to refer to well-organized fieldwork onthe functional outcome of divination practices. Anecdotal reports are morecommon, but have only limited scientific value, though in some instances suchreports can be persuasive. Let us review three cases from widely separated locations in the world. A Tungusshaman in Siberia agrees to the request of tribal hunters to locate game duringa poor hunting season. Using a drumming technique, he enters an ASC and providesinformation to help his hunters. The Western interpretation—if it accepts at allthe validity of this kind of information—would be that the shaman calculates thebehavior of the game according to weather and well-known environmentalconditions. In other words, his is information based on cognitive processing ofsensory data. The explanation of the shaman himself is different: Guidance hasbeen provided by forest spirits. On another continent, hunters of the Kalahari !Kung tribe leave the settlementto hunt for a period that may last anywhere from two days to two weeks. Thetribe’s timely preparation for the return of successful hunters is necessary forprocessing the game. The people left behind make the appropriate steps longbefore the hunters’ reappearance. Their foreknowledge of the hunters’ returncould be explained rationally by attributing it to a messenger sent ahead or theuse of tam-tam drums or smoke signals. The tribesmen report, however, that it isthe spirit of ancestors who informs them when the hunters will return. Next, we move to the Amazon basin. The Shuar shaman is facing a new disease inthe community. An herbal remedy is sought by adding leaves of a candidate plantinto the hallucinogenic beverage ayahuasca, a sacrament indigenous to the UpperAmazon region. The shaman drinks it and, upon return to ordinary consciousness,decides the usefulness of the plant in question. Is his decision based onaccumulation of ethnobotanical knowledge of several generations in combinationwith trial and error? The headhunter Shuar are not likely to be merciful to anineffective medicine man, and his techniques must be working. As Luis EduardoLuna explained to me, according to ayahuasqueros, the spirit of a new plantreveals itself with the help of the spirits associated with the ayahuasca.Sometimes, they also tell which plant to use next. We can point to the following contradiction: Healers from different cultures areunequivocal in their interpretation of the source of knowledge, whereas rationalthinkers use diverging, unsystematic explanations. Which side should be slashedwith Occam’s razor? Also called the “principle of parsimony,” Occam’s razor isusually interpreted to mean something like “Do not multiply hypothesesunnecessarily” or “Do not posit pluralities unnecessarily when generatingexplanatory models.” The principle of parsimony is used frequently byphilosophers of science in an effort to establish criteria for choosing fromtheories with equal explanatory power. At first glance it is the “primitives” who multiply causes unnecessarily byreferring to the supernatural. Yet Occam’s razor may be applied easily to therational view, if those arguments are less parsimonious. What if there is nodistinction between the supernatural and the natural world? Dividing nature intonatural and supernatural, and delegating spirits to the supernatural, may turnout not to be parsimonious within the contemporary assumptions. The split between the supernatural and the natural realm of the world doesn’texist in the view of tribal cultures and mystical traditions. Their experienceof reality is different from Western understanding. According to the traditionalconcept, the world is made up of things seen and things hidden without boundarybetween them. The distinction exists only inside the mind of the unprepared, theuninitiated. For the “knower,” natural and supernatural present themselvestogether as an unseparated whole, both woven into one seamless fabric ofreality. Then who gets the highest score of parsimony? West or East? More precisely,Northwest or Southeast, modern or traditional? (In the section EducatioDemistificationis, we will outline the methodology mystical traditions developedto support their view.) We are not satisfied with the explanatory power of current reasoning. Theapproach presented here does not ignore the aboriginal view in developing abroader model. The view of divination presented here comes closer ininterpretation to the emic view of native people—with the term emic referring tohow cultural phenomena are understood by members of that specific culture, asopposed to etic viewpoints, which are based on rational explanations derivedfrom Western science.17 [index_split_017.html#filepos851994] The basic questionscan be formulated this way: To where does the shamanic healer travel, and whatis the source of the psychointegrative information? THE SHAMANIC JOURNEY The centerpiece of shamanic practice is the shamanic journey. Also known as soulflight, it defines shamans and differentiates them from mediums, psychics, faithhealers, and mystics. Only the shaman travels in an ASC, in a shamanic state ofconsciousness, according to Michael Harner.18[index_split_017.html#filepos852227] The shaman is believed to leave the bodyand to travel at will throughout the expanses of the lower, middle, and upperworlds. Others may heal or minister in an altered state, but it is the shamanalone who primarily engages in soul flight. The shaman is a cosmic travelerbecause > . . . his soul can safely abandon his body and roam at vast distances, can> penetrate the underworld and rise to the sky. Through his own ecstatic> experience he knows the roads of the extraterrestrial regions. He can go below> and above because he has already been there. The danger of losing his way in> these forbidden regions is still great; but sanctified by his initiation and> furnished with his guardian spirit, a shaman is the only human being able to> challenge the danger and venture into a mystical geography.19> [index_split_017.html#filepos852429] The shaman’s journey takes place in “nonordinary reality.”20[index_split_017.html#filepos852613] Along the way, the shaman may traversestrange landscapes and encounter numerous spirits. Such journeys are generallyundertaken in order to learn, to heal, and to help in the service of thecommunity. For instance, the shaman may journey to obtain knowledge or prophecy;to treat illnesses; to appease tribal gods; or to assist individuals in makingthe transition to the land of the dead. According to the shamanic traditions offive continents, spiritual beings are the source of the energy and informationneeded to fulfill these goals. Shamans establish contact with guides or teachers in nonordinary reality fromwhom they solicit advice regarding individual or tribal problems. Healing (i.e.,integrative) power is acquired through interaction with power animals,guardians, or other spiritual entities. In all these activities, during theinformation-seeking endeavor, the shaman remains in control of her or hisfaculties, maintains awareness for recalling experiences, and is able tointerpret them to members of the community upon returning to ordinary reality.Hence, being able to remember what occurred during a shamanic journey iscrucial, and distinguishes the shamanic state of consciousness as a unique ASC. THE SHAMANIC STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS This type of ASC is dreamlike, but shares with the waking world a feeling ofreality. In this state the shaman—like a skilled navigator—is keenly aware ofthe surrounding reality (both ordinary and nonordinary), and can give directionat will to her or his movements. An ASC is one that differs significantly fromordinary or basic consciousness. Baseline consciousness might be best defined bythe presence of two important subjective characteristics: the sense of self atthe center of perception and a sense that this self is identified with the body.States of consciousness in which we lose identification with our body or withour self are definitely ASCs. The former happens in the shamanic state ofconsciousness. An ASC is marked psychologically by an individual’s modified perceptualresponses, processes of memory formation, cognitive skills, affective reactions,and personality structure relative to the basic or ordinary state ofconsciousness for that person. Integration in an ASC can occur because—based onset and setting (frame of mind and situation of the person, respectively)—anattenuation of the ordinary mode and its primary faculties permits the emergenceof integrative symbolic and cognitive processes normally repressed by ordinaryconsciousness.21 [index_split_017.html#filepos852826] Orchestrateddestructuralization, combined with patterning forces that redirect psychologicalfunctioning toward culturally desired patterns of experience, can lead to astable, integrative ASC.22 [index_split_017.html#filepos852991] Some examples of ASCs recognized by Western culture are hypnotic trance, deepsleep, dreaming (REM) sleep, meditation, use of hallucinogenic substances, andperiods of peak athletic performance. Some of these states may be spontaneouslyachieved, instigated by, for example, psychological trauma, sleep disturbance,sensory deprivation or overload, neurochemical imbalance, epileptic fits, andfever. Yet they may also be induced by purposeful activities such as breathingexercises; extreme deprivations (fasting, social isolation); self-inflicted pain(flagellation); reductions or elevations in the level of sensory stimulation;rhythmic photic or sonic stimulation (drumming); and frenzied dancing, spinning,or chanting. Finally, they may be evoked by the use of psychoactive substances.Altered states of consciousness are frequently marked by vivid hallucinationsand visions, the content of which is determined by the cultural background, set,and setting. During its history, humankind has devoted astonishing energy and ingenuity toaltering consciousness. In a survey of 488 societies in all parts of the world,Erika Bourgignon23 [index_split_017.html#filepos853205] found that 437 of thesocieties had one or more culturally patterned forms of ASC. This means thatfully 90 percent of the world’s cultures have one or more institutionalized ASC.In tribal societies and Eastern cultures these are regarded— almost withoutexception—as sacred or revered conditions. Mystical or sacred states ofconsciousness are called samadhi in yoga, moksha in Hinduism, satori in Zen,fana in Sufism, and ruach hakodesh in kabbalah. In the West they are known asunio mystica (Christian mysticism), a numinal state (Carl Jung), peak experience(Abraham Maslow), holotropic experience (Stanislav Grof), cosmic consciousness(Richard Bucke), and flow (Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi). Western rational thinking marginalizes or even pathologizes ASCs: it considersthem not only altered but deviant states, cannot differentiate between theirdisintegrative and integrative forms, and cultivates only the basic state ofordinary consciousness. Hence, the West has been stuck in one state of mind, notcapitalizing on the potential of integrative ASCs. To put it in ecologicalterms, Western civilization, with its institutionalized propensity to escapetranscendence, is a monoculture, like a cornfield with low levels ofbiodiversity, in contrast to the flowery pasture of other traditions. Culturalrelativism prohibits comparing and judging the validity of cultural values.Nevertheless, evolution prefers diversity. The West is largely suspicious ofASCs, lacks institutional means to experience the sacred directly, and is leftwithout an understanding of the integrative properties of transcendent ASCs.Techniques for inducing ASCs—typical in tribal cultures—gave way to meresymbolic rituals; direct experience is replaced by faith; and living ritualtradition of the past is fossilized into dogma. The West would benefit fromreexamining a deeper level of spirituality, paying respect to higher structures,living in accord with other holons (a term favored by Ken Wilber for denotingsystems embedded in joint hierarchies), and working to regain personal access totranscendental realms. This infusion of more traditional spirituality into theWest has been called the Archaic Revival.24 [index_split_017.html#filepos853651] We have seen that the existence of institutionalized procedures for alteringconsciousness is a near-universal characteristic of human culture. The majorityof societies regard ASCs as equal to or of higher value than ordinaryconsciousness. This raises an intriguing dilemma: if there is more than oneaccepted form of consciousness, then the reality to which ASCs of theintegrative type provide access is multiple, and we cannot discard any one asirrelevant or delusional. Here, we arrive at the incommensurability ofrealities. It is untenable to make statements from one form of consciousnessregarding the reality of another. Rationalists think about satori as a dreamlikestate, while a Zen monk may say that it is the ordinary, rational people wholive their lives in a dream world. Experiences of nonordinary reality areineffable in ordinary consciousness. Judging or valuing one state ofconsciousness compared to another is logically prohibited. “Whereof one cannotspeak, thereof one must be silent,” said Ludwig Wittgenstein. A Zen Buddhistwould agree with him on this accord. Yet we continue to break the silence. EDUCATIO DEMISTIFICATIONIS Competing epistemological theories of the last century agree on the nature ofhuman knowledge as a constructive process that builds belief systems based onconsensus. There is no such thing as mirroring objective reality, as it is “initself ”—independent from the observer. Emmanuel Kant pointed out theimplausability of assuming Ding-an-Sich, a thing-in-itself.25[index_split_017.html#filepos853963] Even scientific objectivity cannot achievethat ideal mirroring—even if there was such a thing as scientific objectivity.The evolution of theories is based on internal consistency, explanatory power,and external consistency with other substructures of the knowledge system. Theexperimental method is the “royal road” to reaching agreement, but this canhardly be applied to liberal arts, where an arduous process of long-lastingdebates leads to the necessary consensus. Many people can become excellentexperimental scientists, whereas the social sciences have only a few outstandingthinkers in each generation. Experimental science has a simple algorithm to befollowed: > Under such-and-such circumstances (like mine), > Do this and this (like me), > Observe what happens, > And report it. In other words: 1) set the experimental conditions, 2) define the method, 3)make observations, and 4) publish them. It should not come as a surprise (but most of the time it does) that mysticsfollow a similar algorithm, the same methodological schema in theircontemplative techniques of seeking knowledge. Authentic mystics ask thatnothing be accepted on mere belief or verbal teaching. Rather, they present aset of tasks within the laboratory of our mind. We experiment, observe results,and compare these results with the experience of others who perform similarexperiments. Out of this consensually validated pool of knowledge emerge certainlaws—the laws of the spirit.26 [index_split_017.html#filepos854179] This is aform of empiricism as well. The only difference is the lack of quantifiablemeasurement. It is not reality’s problem, however, that it has immeasurableprocesses. Rather, it is the problem of scientism, which limits nature to themeasurable. Experimental science is based on quantified measures of external reality.According to its extreme form—scientism—whatever can’t be measured in some wayis deemed unreal, and thus its value is unknowable. Values, emotions, andintuition have no part in the scientific worldview; there is no room forthoughts and feelings, only measurements of what is “out there.” The materialside of life—not the internal or spiritual—is all-important. The inner world hasbeen abandoned, and we have lost ties with totality. Scientists with highintegrity are aware of the limits of their own method. As a line in the filmDirty Harry says, “A man’s gotta know his limitations!”27[index_split_017.html#filepos854408] The greatest scientific revolutionarieswere mystical at heart: Kepler, Newton, and Einstein, to name just a few. Consensus can be reached in a third manner: hammering concepts into the subjectwith the help of faith (the word consensus is used euphemistically in thiscase). This is not about attacking the general importance of faith, but israther about the inflation of faith—exploiting it as the replacement ofempirical experience. Dogmatic religions apply this method and thereby abusefaith. From this point of view, there is more similarity between a scientist anda mystic than a scientist and an orthodox religious believer. The claims of bothgroups of wise men are not based on mere beliefs or doctrines, but rather ondirect experience. In the era of the holy Inquisition, scientists and mysticswere in the same boat, while after the scientific revolution, mystics had tostay underground. We have so far attempted to demystify mysticism and to move itcloser to the scientific method of knowledge building. Now, we will try toreconcile science and the realm of our inner universe. LEVELS OF ORGANIZATION RELEVANT TO CONSCIOUSNESS The table that follows in figure 7.3 summarizes the levels of organizationsupposedly involved in generating the conscious experience. Because the topic ofconsciousness is mostly ignored by mainstream neuroscience, it is difficult todetermine the opinion of prominent brain researchers concerning the subject. Mydepartment chairman once warned me: “If you want to make a career, you mustavoid studying consciousness.” Despite some positive trends in otherdisciplines, orthodox neuroscientists avoid the issue, and unorthodox ones usethe politically correct term awareness when preparing their grant proposals.Nevertheless, with the exception of the levels at the very top and at the verybottom of the table, most neuroscientists would not disagree with the assumptionthat all these levels represented here are involved in the process. Because no experimental data can be introduced to support it, this hypothesis isstrengthened by pointing out inconsistencies within the current neuroscientificconcepts. Again, this is not easy, because we rarely hear establishedneuroscientists expressing their views on consciousness. If they do, theyemphasize the neurological correlates of consciousness, as did Francis Crick,28[index_split_017.html#filepos854651] who spelled out his radical reductionistvision: “You, your joys and your sorrows, your memories and your ambitions, yoursense of personal identity and free will are in fact no more than the behaviorof a vast assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules. As LewisCarroll’s Alice might have phrased it, ‘You’re nothing but a pack of neurons.’” image [images/00031.jpg] Science writer John Horgan criticized such narrow views: > In a sense, Crick is right. We are nothing but a pack of neurons. At the same> time, neuroscience has so far proved to be oddly unsatisfactory. Explaining> the mind in terms of neurons has not yielded much more insight or benefit than> explaining the mind in terms of quarks and electrons. There are many> alternative reductionisms. We are nothing but a pack of idiosyncratic genes.> We are nothing but a pack of adaptations sculpted by natural selection. We are> nothing but a pack of computational devices dedicated to different tasks. We> are nothing but a pack of sexual neuroses. These proclamations, like Crick’s,> are all defensible, and they are all inadequate.29> [index_split_017.html#filepos854878] To avoid the trap of radical reductionism, we must assume that all levels are atwork with bidirectional, interrelated, causative processes. We should payattention to the position of the dashed line in figure 7.3. We may call it theknowledge horizon, because it divides levels based upon their assumedcausational role in generating the conscious experience. According to the theoryof the neurological correlates of consciousness, the neuroaxonal system has apivotal role both in the emergence of conscious experience and in the functionof levels above it. In his book The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of HumanNature, Steven Pinker writes, “[C]ulture is crucial, but culture could not existwithout mental faculties that allow humans to create and learn culture to beginwith.”30 [index_split_017.html#filepos855140] The effect of culture in shaping brain structure and neuroaxonal function isalso permitted. This means that bottom-up and top-down interactions are at workabove the dashed line, and every level has an active role. This is not the casefor interactions below it: the assumption here is that subcellular levels arepassive, serving higher levels by permitting, but not shaping, their function.Here the causation operates only from bottom-up, but the role of top-downeffects is not believed to operate at this level in mainstream neuroscientificthinking. Above the horizontal line, there is a well-balanced cooperativehierarchy; below it, oligarchy is the rule. Of course, this is an arbitrarydelineation with broken symmetry. For improved integrity, we may postulate thatsubcellular systems add to the experience something that is a characteristic oftheir level. They can also shape consciousness. Because the size of thesubneural component is close to quantum physical measures, the suggestedcharacteristic subcellular levels add to consciousness is their connection toquantum reality or “quantum weirdness,” as some physicists like to say. The mostoutstanding case of quantum weirdness is nonlocality, more specifically signalnonlocality. THE END OF LOCAL REALISM AND THE LIMITS OF QUANTUM THEORY The most unusual feature of quantum reality is its independence of thespace–time constraints of classical physics, which assume local realism andlocal causality. Local realism is a combination of two intuitive notions: 1) thelocality principle, which states that physical effects have a finite propagationspeed; and 2) the reality principle, which means that particle attributes havedefinite values independent of the act of observation. TheEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox was first in formulating the followingdilemma: The laws of quantum mechanics are not consistent with the assumptionsof local realism. Based on the EPR paradox, Albert Einstein et al.31[index_split_017.html#filepos855368] suggested that the theory of quantummechanics was incomplete. John Bell’s theorem32[index_split_017.html#filepos855675] indicated that local realism requiresinvariants that are not present in quantum mechanics, and implied that quantummechanics cannot satisfy local realism. Bell’s experiments33[index_split_017.html#filepos855916] provided overwhelming empirical evidenceagainst local realism and demonstrated that under special circumstances, “spookyaction at a distance” (using Albert Einstein’s words) does in fact occur.Different interpretations of quantum mechanics reject different components oflocal realism. In one interpretation, local realism is broken down due to the principle ofnonlocality, which posits that distant objects can have direct, instantaneousinfluence on one another. The nonlocality principle derives from quantumentanglement: a set of particles that have interacted as parts of the samequantum system maintain their interaction after separation, regardless of spaceand time constrains. Quantum states of two or more entangled objects have to bedescribed with reference to each other, even though the individual objects maybe separated light-years in space and millennia in time. State correlation ispreserved between observable physical properties of systems connected in quantumentanglement. Entanglement means that the involved systems are correlated; itdoesn’t imply that signals pass between them. To put it simply andanthropomorphically, entangled systems “sense” each other without space and timeconstraints. If we add to quantum mechanics some seemingly plausible requirements such aslocality, realism, and completeness, then contradiction emerges. In essence,quantum mechanics, with the wave function at its core, cannot be complete,unitary, real, local, nonlinear, and causal at the same time. Competinginterpretations of quantum mechanics differ in choosing the conditions they arewilling to sacrifice in order to save the rest, or choosing what one may modifywith resultant change in the others. The living post–quantum theory isnonlinear, nonunitary, and spontaneously self-organizing, with a “two-wayrelation” between “it” and “bit.”34 [index_split_017.html#filepos856419] Though the theory of quantum mechanics has perfect internal consistency andstrong predictive power, it has weak external consistency compared to otherrealms of current knowledge. Nevertheless, it maintains consistency with thetheory of relativity. With the help of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, thetheory of relativity is not violated by nonlocal actions because some vitalinformation is scrambled during the process. Some information can be obtainednonlocally, but no one can control the information in advance, in a easilyreplicable way: bidirectional information exchange with supraluminal(faster-than-light) speed does not occur. Therefore, lack of local realism doesnot lead to what could be referred to as “spooky communication at a distance.” Some interpreters of contemporary physics suggest that nonlocality is not anesoteric idea. On the contrary, it is a very realistic one. According to them,nonlocality is actually the basic principle of the universe, meaning that thewhole universe is an interconnected, entangled totality. According to this view,consciousness is inherently nonlocal as well. This fundamental nonlocality ofmind and universe collapses in the ordinary state of consciousness. Space andtime are themselves manifestations of this breakdown, and with them theseparated array of particles that dominate large areas of the universe. In thisinterpretation, individual consciousness arises from the interplay ofmind—developing within the nonlocal aspect of the universe—and matter, which isthe localized aspect of this same universe. Where in the brain does this interplay occur? What part of the brain serves asan interface between nonlocal and local processes, between the mind and thematerial universe? THE MATRIX After the development of quantum mechanics, many physicists, and subsequentlyother scientists and nonscientist popularizers, were caught up in the excitedbelief that quantum theory might explain the mystery of consciousness. Thereexists a precise correspondence between physical reality and logic, foraccording to the laws of matrix logic,35 [index_split_017.html#filepos856754]these are two aspects of the same thing. The striking similarities between thegeneral quantum and thought processes gave rise to the quantum hypothesis of themind. Discovery of quantum computation added another impetus, and dozens ofbrain models were developed based on quantum computational principles. Amongthem, the most elaborate is the Penrose-Hameroff model,36[index_split_017.html#filepos856957] though it may not necessarily be theentirely correct or ultimate one.*7 [index_split_016.html#filepos812631]Nevertheless, the strength of our concept is not tied to the validity of onemodel, but to the argumentation outlined in the preceding paragraphs foravoiding the trap of radical reductionism. Roger Penrose and Stuart Hameroff propose that consciousness emerges frombiophysical processes acting at the subcellular level and involving cytoskeletalstructures. In their model, consciousness is attributed to quantum computationin cytoskeletal proteins organized into a network of microtubules within thebrain’s neurons. The cytoskeleton is dynamic “scaffolding,” a network of tubesand filaments providing both structural support and the means of transportationof subcellular materials in the cell. While the cytoskeleton has traditionallybeen associated with purely structural functions, recent evidence has revealedthat it is involved in signaling and information processing as well. The microtubules’ periodic lattice structure (see figure 7.4 on page 190) seemsideally suited to molecular-scale computation and is possibly the source of theamazing feats of unicellular protozoa. These tiny, one-celled organisms swim,learn, navigate around objects, avoid predators, and find food and mates—allwithout the benefit of a nervous system. In multicellular organisms,microtubules are connected to each other structurally by protein links andfunctionally by gap junctions, self-assembling into a nanoscale network that isfar more vast than the neuroaxonal system. The human brain has approximately1011 neurons and 1018 microtubule units (tubulins). The dimensions of theneuronal cell-body are measured in micrometers; the diameter in nanometers.Microtubules interact with other cell structures, mechanically with the aid ofproteins, chemically by ions and “second-messenger” signals, and electrically byvoltage fields. In the brain, they organize synaptic connections and regulatesynaptic activity responsible for memory and learning. The microtubular network—with ten million times more elements than neurons andwith a component size close to the quantum physical realm—is a reasonablecandidate for quantum computation and nonlocal information processing. Therecent paradigm is signal nonlocality, meaning that joint tasks that wouldrequire exchanging classical signals can take place without passing anyinformation in an entangled system. Signal nonlocality is purely correlational;it doesn’t involve information transfer exceeding the speed of light. Therefore,Einstein’s principle is not violated. By the way, just as special relativity isa limiting case of general relativity, so is classical quantum mechanics withsignal locality a limiting case of postquantum theory with signal nonlocality.37[index_split_017.html#filepos857220] The latter is exactly what is implicit inthe microtubule model of quantum consciousness and may help us understand whatmay happen in the mystical or shamanic state of consciousness. image [images/00032.jpg] THE QUANTUM ARRAY ANTENNA OF THE BRAIN Proposed is a biological model of information processing in which subcellular,cytoskeletal networks serve as a basis for quantum computation and represent amedium of quantum holography. Microtubules fulfill multiple tasks in theexperiences of the human mind: they can influence learning at the macro leveland shape consciousness at the micro level—and the cytoskeletal matrix may beimmense enough to contain holographic information about the whole universe vianonlocal interactions. The discovery of contemporary physics that every form ofmatter is able to emit quanta of energy which are coherent and nonlocal andwhich carry usable information about the object demonstrates that quantumphysics pertains to all matter of any size, not just elementary particles. ThePlanck constant can be applied to every size and scale, not only thenanoscale.38 [index_split_017.html#filepos857428] Furthermore, these energyemissions with nonlocal information sharing can be modeled by the samemathematical formalism used for laser photography, thus the term quantumholography. (Here, the word quantum does not necessarily imply particlephysics.) It is thought that quantum processes not only underlie all classical phenomena,but also that quantum laws can be applied to macroscale events. This means thequantum principle does not dissipate in the macroworld. The universe replicates,or, as Matti Pitkanen says, “emulates,” itself on every level and within thebrain’s structure as well. In a quantum holographic model, the action of mind isnot restricted to the brain, but instead extends to the whole cosmos: The mindbreaks out of the skull. Hank Wesselman, an eminent author of the neoshamanic movement (see more abouthim in chapter 9), arrived at a similar conclusion: > Recent changes to quantum theory and current discoveries in neurobiology> reveal that the brain organizes information holographically and functions like> a massively parallel quantum computer, with the microtubules in the neurons of> the brain being the likely quantum hologram receptors. It has been suggested> that the quantum hologram is the wave portion of the wave-particle duality for> macroscale objects. It has also been proposed that the quantum hologram may> tie the phenomenal universe of quantum, micro, macro, and cosmic-sized> phenomena together, and that the quantum hologram may be the mechanism through> which nature learns. This knowledge implies that the quantum hologram may be> the basis for all perception, including psychic awareness. It also suggests> that true psychic sight is not a sixth sense, but rather the first, because it> may very well have been around since the Big Bang.39> [index_split_017.html#filepos857637] Nonlocal information about the physical universe provides the missing linkbetween objective science and subjective experience, including the mysticalexperience. Based on the principle of nonlocality and with the quantum arrayantennae of cytoskeletal networks, the brain is in resonance with the wholeuniverse. If the brain truly contains the whole cosmos, like a hologram, thenthe perennial wisdom of “As above, so below,” (or: “As within, so without”),“The kingdom of heaven is within you,” and “Look within; you are the Buddha”obtains a fresh perspective, and there is hope for the integration of theseideas into Western rational thinking. The cytoskeletal matrix can be themediator of the Jungian collective unconscious, and cytoskeletal quantumholography can explain a very common but obscure phenomenon known as intuition. THE DIRECT–INTUITIVE–NONLOCAL MIND: A SECOND FOUNDATION OF KNOWLEDGE? > We must close our eyes and invoke a new manner of seeing . . . a wakefulness> that is the birthright of us all, though few put it to use. PLOTINUS Ritual ceremonies and other spiritual practices based on the integrative formsof altered states of consciousness—an integrative ASC, contrasted with adisintegrative state such as psychosis or drunkenness, results in healing—seemto elude neuroscientific explanations based on classical cognition, which can beconceptualized as a perceptual–cognitive–symbolic way of information-processingcharacteristic of ordinary states of consciousness. This can be contrasted withanother mode of information processing based on nonlocal connections, denotedhere as direct–intuitive–nonlocal. The perceptual–cognitive–symbolic mode is neuroaxonally based and relies onsensory perception, cognitive processing, and symbolic (verbal, logical, andvisual language) mediation. This form of information-processing is an indirectway of achieving knowledge compared to the direct–intuitive–nonlocal method. Inaccordance with the indirect nature of its processing, this mode splits theworld into subject and object, and then performs modeling. Its linguisticfeature makes this mode culturally bound with knowledge transferable betweenindividuals of the same culture. The perceptual–cognitive–symbolic method ofinformation processing has been evolved evolutionally for the purpose of tasksolving, represents a “coping machine” at work, and reaches its peak in Westernscientific thinking. The introduction of a direct–intuitive–nonlocal channel is necessary for anontological interpretation of the integrative ASC such as the shamanic state ofconsciousness. Supposedly, this mode of accessing knowledge is based onsubcellular, cytoskeletal functions, provides direct experience bypassingsensory organs without splitting to subject and object, and is not bound bylanguage or other symbols. Because the direct–intuitive–nonlocal channel lackssymbolic–linguistic mediation, it has universal characteristics and shows moretranscultural similarity, although culture-specific interpretations exist. Thismay be why mystics, as compared to materialistic scientists, get betteragreement comparing their “data.” David Lewis-William and David Pearce write in their book Inside the NeolithicMind:40 [index_split_017.html#filepos857871] “In altered states of consciousnessthe nervous system itself becomes a ‘sixth sense.’” We can agree with this andadd that it is the cytoskeletal system that acts as a sixth sense. Regretfully,Lewis-Williams and Pearce navigate to the calm waters of academical concepts: “.. . [T]hat produces a variety of images including entoptic phenomena. The brainattempts to recognize, or decode, [these] forms as it does with impressionssupplied by the nervous system in a normal state of consciousness.” They areright, as are most of the authors who emphasize the “made-up” quality of theASC. I am not arguing here for the ontological validation of every experience inan ASC, but instead for those few, very informative ones in integrative ASCs. The direct–intuitive–nonlocal perception of the world also requires rigoroustraining for its highest development, as is common in all fields. It takesdecades to train an indigenous shaman because the direct– intuitive–nonlocalroute into the realm of nonordinary consciousness is seemingly capricious; itsdenizens are so unpredictable, and our perceptual–cognitive–symbolic mind is sounprepared, being incapable of distinguishing between what is personal and whatis impersonal. What can be nourished can be atrophied as well, as has occurredin Western civilization, where the direct–intuitive–nonlocal channel has become“forgotten knowledge.” Perhaps this was the source of ancient myths. Givingcredit to mythical knowledge also means that the teachings of ancient myths andwisdom tradition should be considered as starting points for developing modernscientific theories and that they deserve to be tested as “working hypotheses”by the scientific method. Gaining control is the means, the modus operandi, of the “coping machine” thatis essential for the functioning of the perceptual– cognitive–symbolic mode. Onthe other hand, the need for control (control freakiness) is entirelyincompatible with the direct–intuitive– nonlocal approach. Lao-tzu defineswisdom as “complete willingness to be the plaything of chance circumstances.”Surrender opens the doors of a new way of perception. Every success of thecoping machinery, such as fame, position, money, or another form of socialacceptance, empowers the ego—unless the individual interprets his or herachievements as gifts from the “outside,” “from above,” and considers the selfas a vessel, a mediator of majestic powers. Identifying too strongly with theagent of perceptual–cognitive–symbolic processing suppresses thedirect–intuitive–nonlocal way. As Matthew 19:24 relates: “It is easier for acamel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into thekingdom of God.” Wisdom traditions usually recommend a humble attitude forapproaching the spiritual realm. Without humility, the full potency of thisrealm remains hidden beyond the veil. Christianity’s preoccupation with Original Sin is in essence the declaration ofhumans’ inborn moral incompetence. Promotion of feelings of guilt is a powerfultool for controlling people and for supporting ruling hierarchies at the sametime. Perhaps there is no need to use guilt as a method to smash the ego;elimination of ego-inflation might be enough for opening the doors of newperception, and what is left of the ego can be used in the service of the commongood. In the realm of the mystical Beyond, the opposite of control freakiness isnot loss of control, but rather the delegation of control to spiritualprotectors. That may be sufficient for mitigating ego’s overwhelming influence. The perceptual–cognitive–symbolic foundation of knowledge is a result of thebrain’s interactions with the local aspects of the universe. Thedirect–intuitive–nonlocal perception of the world derives from the nonlocalfeatures of the cosmos. In other words, the local universe of the classical,Newtonian worldview is the reality of our ordinary consciousness, based on theperceptual–cognitive–symbolic process. On the other hand, the mind’s interfacingwith the nonlocal universe (revealed by modern physics) generates the reality ofnonordinary states. We consider these issues in order to explicate the wisdom of perennialphilosophy, which states that there are two realms of reality. The physical orphenomenal world is not the only reality; another nonphysical (i.e.,nonclassical) realm exists. The Buddha rejected complexity of doctrine. His trueunderstanding of the nature of reality was based on the direct experience(direct–intuitive–nonlocal) of that which cannot be put into writing (theprinciple of ineffability) and on the communion of the spirit (the latter, inour words: cytoskeletally mediated the universe with the help of quantumentanglement). Besides stratification of reality, according to different states ofconsciousness, an intriguing corollary of these hypotheses is that intuitionbecomes a valid source of information. That is, intuition can now be liberatedfrom being some vague offshoot of a multimodal, parallel-processing function ofthe perceptual–cognitive–symbolic mode. It belongs entirely to the nonlocalchannel, which means that when we are talking about intuition and psychicprocesses—or indeed, any phenomenon belonging to the field ofparapsychology—there is a quantum hologram with nonlocal correlations underlyingthe process. Nonlocality is to the physicist what interconnectedness is to themystic, and the quantum hologram is the foundation through which to understandvirtually all paranormal phenomena. Accepting the direct–intuitive–nonlocal as the second foundation of knowledge,obscure phenomena such as channeling and divination can be viewed from a newperspective. Channeling is a unique way of gaining intuitive information thathas been known for centuries.41 [index_split_017.html#filepos858104] It is acommunication of information to or through a person from a supernatural agency.As such, it represents a form of a broader concept known as divination, which isan attempt to obtain information from supernatural sources. In many instances,the channeled information can stem from the channeler’s own mind, but someexperts in the field42 [index_split_017.html#filepos858545] are quite certainthat not all channeled information can be traced to the channeler’s individualmind. Channeling can be conceptualized by drawing a parallel between it and thetunneling effect.43 [index_split_017.html#filepos858818] Just as an elementaryparticle can show up in space, where its presence is impossible according toclassical laws of physics, in channeling (and in divination as well),information surfaces where and when it is unexpected according to mainstreamviews. In ordinary state of consciousness, the dominant input of the cognitive–symbolicprocessing is perceptual. In integrative ASC, a shift may occur withsignificantly more intuitive–nonlocal information passing through cognitiveworkup and taking the shape of symbolic expressions. If data of nonlocal originenter the sensory cortex, those would be projected into the perceptual field inthe form of visions and apparitions. The body, the somatic center of the“skin-encapsulated” ego, serves as an anchoring point for theperceptual–cognitive–symbolic processing. This reference center is missing incases of out-of-body experiences (OBEs), when nonlocal data serve the main inputof cognitive–symbolic processing with consequential projections into theperceptual field. For the subject, his or her perception during the experienceis of colorful scenery and successive external events, whereas the journeyactually happens in the quantum hologram of the subcellular matrix. Scholarsjudging OBEs as mental projections are right. However, the projectional elementof the OBE is not entirely in denial with the validity of the informationreceived. The outlined dualism of human knowledge resembles Julian Jaynes’s “bicameralmind,”44 [index_split_017.html#filepos859074] but we are not concerned as muchabout a left–right hemispheric distribution of work as about an up–down divisionbetween neural and cytoskeletal (nanoneurological) function. The detailedneuroaxonal and subneural processing serve as the basis of the two modes ofwisdom known in esoteric traditions for millennia. As Rabbi Joel David Bakstputs it: > According to the teachings of esoteric Judaism, all knowledge, both spiritual> and material wisdom, originally coexisted in a seamless unity within a higher> dimension. Together these two modes of wisdom comprised a larger,> all-encompassing Universal Torah (Torah meaning “Teachings”). A collapse,> however, ensued in which the database of all knowledge split itself into> “spiritual” and “material” planes of existence. Thus, we have the basis for> the historical conflict between “religion” and “science.” Yet, any given> mystical or technological truth can only be one of two sides of the same> puzzle. Thus, the material world is also a mode of spirituality, only> externalized and concretized. Vice versa, the spiritual world is a mode of the> material reality, only internalized and spiritualized. The ultimate truth is> not revealed through the supra-natural alone nor is it only discovered through> scientific development—it is more than both.45> [index_split_017.html#filepos859313] As we discussed previously, technological truth (that is, the rationalperceptual–cognitive–symbolic truth) reflects regularities of sequential eventsobserved from the local aspect of the universe, and mystical knowledge (that is,the irrational direct–intuitive–nonlocal knowledge) results from experiencingcorrelations that originate from quantum entanglement within the nonlocal frameof reality.*8 [index_split_016.html#filepos812841] The split must be eliminated,however. As Rabbi Bakst writes: > Both forms of wisdom are destined to reunite with each other. Perforce, this> is stimulating a worldwide paradigm shift in consciousness. This stage of> global evolution is the Messianic Era that is central to the teachings of> esoteric as well as traditional Judaism. Our role in the re-unification of> these two modes of wisdom, according to this doctrine, is achieved by matching> the right tool with the right job. In other words, we must use the new maps,> models and metaphors of the “wisdom from below” in order to grasp the “wisdom> from above.” In turn, the transcendent wisdom of the Torah will cast its light> of clarity and direction upon the enchanting and often over-powering tools of> science and technology.46 [index_split_017.html#filepos859608] This is exactly what this chapter has been trying to accomplish: providing a newneurobiological model and new metaphors. Those clumsy word amalgams such asperceptual–cognitive–symbolic and direct–intuitive–nonlocal are efforts toexpress the two forms of wisdom in a self-definitive manner. As Rabbi Bakstwrote in a personal communication, > I would only like to [emphasize] that the two modes—the various amalgams we> are compelled to conjure up or the ancient terms the Torah and the rabbis use> to quantify them—are equally necessary and, in their roots eternal . . . but> they are not equivalent. In other words, “localized” science relative to> “non-localized” Supernal Wisdom is always as a body to a soul, a vessel to its> light, a glove to its hand. Yet, when they are truly united, as they were> before the collapse of the higher dimension, each reveals endless truths> contained within each other! Now, that is a real marriage made in heaven!” The dualism in information-processing carries consequences for artificialintelligence (AI): There are efforts to model the neuralperceptual–cognitive–symbolic mode, but what about the subneuraldirect–intuitive–nonlocal one? Where is the nanotechnology for creating aquantum holograph of the universe, a “machine with soul,” a computer capable ofaccessing the spiritual? We should be very disappointed by the ever-returningfuturistic idea that numerous distinguished thinkers entertain of replacingneurons with silicon chips and “downloading” our consciousness into anartificial brain for the purpose of “mind cloning.” This kind of mentality—socharacteristic of current AI research—carries the bias of radical reductionism:it zooms in on modeling the neuroaxonal and forgets about emulation of othernetworks that contribute to the phenomenon of consciousness. KEYS TO NONLOCAL REALMS The use of psychedelic drugs, monotonous drumming, repeated refrains ofchanting, extreme fatigue, strict fasting, frenzied dancing, and so forth duringtraditional rituals results in the breakdown of ordinary cognition. The outcomeis neither chaotic behavior nor insanity. A shift occurs when the copingcapacity of perceptual–cognitive–symbolic processing is exhausted in astressful, unmanageable situation, when the “coping machine” cannot handle thesituation (this might be the hidden agenda of the Zen koans, when the Zen mastercontinuously frustrates the novice’s cognition by paradoxes), or when itsinfluence is turned off in meditation or eliminated by the use of a powerfulpsychedelic. Then the spiritual universe opens up in the quantum hologram of thedirect–intuitive–nonlocal channel, with its particular content projected intothe machinery of the neuroaxonal system, a process shaped by set and setting. Rick Strassman has hypothesized that levels of dimethyltryptamine (DMT), theendogenous psychedelic compound in the brain, is released in near-deathexperiences or in religious ecstasy or by means of ritual techniques (spiritquest, shamanic initiation).47 [index_split_017.html#filepos859735] Psychedelicdrugs in general, and DMT in particular, are some of the most powerful keys tohell or heaven. Proper doses dissolve ego boundaries. In conditions of totalego-loss, reason recedes as the mind’s fundamental orienting function and thenew compass must be faith—not inflated faith, which substitutes for empiricalexperience, but faith in service of the self. Reason is in service of thebody-centered, skin-encapsulated individual ego, and the ego can barely guidesomeone under the influence of a powerful psychedelic or in some other ASC. Inthe mystical Beyond, in nonlocal realms, faith, guardian angels, or spiritguides can do a better job. SPIRITED AWAY Communication with spirits is a key feature of shamanic practice as well asserious mental illness. Where is the difference, then? Perhaps spirits may existnot only in the mind of a psychotic (seriously mentally ill) patient but also“outside” as projected mediators of nonlocal information emerging inside of aperson with psychic skills. Spirits are not necessarily projections ofunconscious conflicts or complexes (although they may certainly be). They havespecific structure and carry information existing in the realm of thedirect–intuitive–nonlocal approach. Bypassing the perceptual stage, thatinformation can be brought directly into cognitive–symbolic processing andexpressed linguistically in a culture-specific manner. Spiritual beingsoriginating from nonlocal apperceptions have more informative value than do theghosts of intrapsychic projections. That is one important difference betweenshamanic healers and schizophrenic patients. Shamanic healers enter anintegrative form of an ASC purposefully in service of the community, whileschizophrenic patients fall hopelessly into a disintegrative form of an ASC andare unable to bring out any socially useful information from that condition. Themain tenet of this chapter is that the difference between psychosis and shamanicstates of consciousness is lack of (in psychosis) and presence of (in a shamanicASC) an integrative information-gaining process from the nonlocal domain. “How could you, a mathematician, believe that extraterrestrials were sending youmessages?” a visitor from Harvard asked the mathematician John Nash, one of thefounders of game theory and Nobel Prize laureate in economics who suffered fromschizophrenic disorder. “Because the ideas I had about supernatural beings cameto me the same way my mathematical ideas did,” was Nash’s answer. “So I tookthem seriously.” Thus begins Nash’s story, a tale of a mathematical genius whoslipped into madness and emerged after decades of ghostlike existence to win aNobel Prize and inspire a major motion picture, A Beautiful Mind.48[index_split_017.html#filepos859915] His statement is an excellent example ofthe occurrence of both integrative and disintegrative ASCs in the same person. In his book The Cosmic Serpent, Jeremy Narby presents the hypothesis thatshamans take consciousness down to the molecular level and gain access in theirvisions to information related to DNA, which they call “animate spirits.”49[index_split_017.html#filepos860172] In essence, Narby got it right. The DNA,packed in chromosomes, is closely related to the microtubular system. There areavant-garde, very nonmainstream theories about DNA being not an originator butrather a receiver of morphogenetic (structure forming) information “lying outthere” (that is, in the nonlocal domain). It follows from the conceptualframework of this chapter that DNA receives information from the microtubularnetwork, which is considered the antenna of nonlocal information. With the helpof the genetic code, DNA translates that biologically relevant information intothe language of protein synthesis in the same way the neuroaxonal systemtranslates the direct– intuitive–nonlocal information into the concepts ofcognitive–symbolic processing. In my opinion, Narby’s shaman does not gainknowledge about the double helix from the DNA itself; rather, his neuroaxonalsystem accesses the same nonlocal source that the DNA molecule does! TRUE HALLUCINATIONS Shamanic states of consciousness constitute profound changes of perception thatcan include visual, auditory, olfactory (smell-related), gustatory(taste-related), and somatic (bodily) illusions or hallucinations as well assynesthesia, the blending of sensory modalities (for example, sounds that areperceived as images or colors that are perceived as smells). Nonlocalinformation can also blend with perceptions of the local aspects of an object orperson. An illuminated healer can perceive an aura around the sick person anduse its embedded information for therapeutic purposes. Auras in the presentedmodel appear when synesthesia occurs between the two modalities of informationprocessing (local and nonlocal). This kind of aura is different from visualizedelectromagnetic fields surrounding living or inanimate objects and cannot bephotographed using Kirlian photography. Viewing auras entails the conversion ofnonlocal information to visual percept with projection to the local realm ofreality. Though no mental projection can be recorded instrumentally, this formconveys relevant information; therefore, some sort of reality must be attributedto it. The outlined conceptualization of auras sets the stage for an interpretation ofvisionary experiences that is at odds with the current academic view. There isan unspoken assumption within scientific circles—based on the experiences ofpsychotic, schizophrenic individuals—that the brain simply fabricateshallucinations, whereas, with the images of normal perception, the brainperceives relevant data from the outside world. Both sides of this assumptionhave some aspect of truth, but both are hopelessly narrow in scope. The brain isnot a passive receiver in the process of normal perception: cognitivepsychologists have clarified its active role. Visionary hallucinationsoriginating from integrative ASCs have informative value and therefore should beregarded as more than mere fabrications. Would it not be more consistent tostate that our brain is both a receiver and a manufacturer of perceptsregardless of whether those are normal or visionary? In conclusion: the brainhandles the data the same whether coming from the local or the nonlocal domainof reality. The former is accepted as normal perception, the latter can beconceptualized as a hallucination (vision) of the integrative type. MASTERS OF NONLOCALITY Shamans are the masters, though not the only ones, of nonlocal realms. In theshamanic state they shift their consciousness from the neuroaxonal mode to thesubneural one, enter the quantum hologram stored in the very intricate networkof the subcellular systems of their body and journey there. They are in and outat the same time. I suppose that it is the nonlocal correlations that make theout-of-body experience possible. After navigating through nonlocal realms withinthe quantum hologram, shamans are able to bring information into the localaspect of the universe by mastering nonlocal connections. In essence, theymanipulate nonlocal correlations and their conversion into local information,which may involve the transfer of direct–intuitive–nonlocal experience pertinentfor healing to the level of cognitive symbolic processing. Yet they are humble,respecting the tenets of Albert Einstein and obeying the law of relativity. Anauthentic shaman does not exchange clear, quantifiable information in areplicable manner with supraluminal speed, but acquires new information withsome uncertainty, expressing it in vague terms and symbols that can beunderstand only within the framework of shamanic belief system. As MattiPitkanen phrased it in a personal communication: > Sharing of mental images by quantum entanglement could be one mechanism that> makes possible instantaneous sharing of information. . . . It might be that> limits in the speed of propagation of the information posed by the light> velocity do not produce problems here, since the shaman becomes part of a> system which can be arbitrarily large. Interpretation is, however, a problem,> since it must be carried out in the conceptual framework provided by the> cultural background. Verifiable (i.e., replicable) information exchange requires transfer at luminalspeed and occurs on the local level within classical, though relativistic,space–time boundaries. Signal nonlocality provides supraluminal but somewhatnebulous information. Therefore, even the most honest and respectable master ofnonlocality is overshadowed by character features of a charlatan or trickster inthe eye of the rational beholder. REDUCTIO AD ABSURDUM In the final part of this chapter, we look at a generalization regarding the lawof neural pruning. The law states that during critical periods of ontogenesisand before important developmental milestones, there is a strictly programmed,finely patterned, marked reduction in progressively smaller elements of theinformation processing system of the brain (see box on page 205). Due to ourprogrammed neuron death, we are born with significantly fewer nerve cells thanwe have during intrauterine life. In the neuro-Darwinian selection model ofGerald Edelman, this program is described as neurons competing with each otherfor survival. During the first two years of life, there is a reduction ofaxon-arborization (production of new nerve fibers), which is probably related tothe development of critical periods of perception, communication, andsocialization. In puberty, pruning of synapses establishes neuroaxonalconditions for abstract thinking, marking the onset of Jean Piaget’s formaloperations stage. Thus, more is not better for the brain. The pruning process inquestion is strictly programmed, however, and follows certain rules inparticular environmental conditions. This is unlike the neural dieback resultingfrom the toxicity of alcohol in an alcoholic. > --------------------------------------------------------------------------------> > The Generalized Law of Pruning> > > > > > > > During critical periods of personal growth and before important developmental> steps, there is a strictly programed, finely patterned, very marked reduction> in progressively smaller elements of the information-processing system of the> brain.> > > > > * Intrauterine life: programmed neuron death (neuro-Darwinian selection model> of Edelman);> > > * First two years: reduction of axon-arborization (critical periods of> perception, communication, socialization);> > > * In adolescence: synaptic pruning (Piaget’s stage of formal operations,> abstract thinking);> > > > > image [images/00002.jpg]> > > > * Dual consciousness, Jungian individuation may be related to pruning of the> microtubular system (see Hameroff’s model);> > > * Biological death—nirvana (after living properly): reduction (but not> elimination) of the pattern of space–time left after the functioning brain> (based on Penrose’s “Orch OR” model).> > > -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Current neuroscientific thinking stops at this point (indicated by the dottedline in the box above). Yet do we ever complete this pruning procedure? Probablynot. High stages of consciousness (dual consciousness in Ken Wilber’s model) orthe Jungian individuation may be related to pruning of the microtubular system,as is found in Hameroff’s model. At our final exit, at the time of biologicaldeath, there is an ultimate step in the reduction (but not a total elimination)of the fabric of space–time left behind by the functioning brain. This idea isconnected to Penrose’s space–time geometry model of consciousness—based onspinor networks seen at the bottom level of figure 7.3 on page 184. Can the last step in pruning be related to the 1urvival of the soul? Here wehave arrived at what Socrates, the father of European rationalism (andirrationalism), said: “The mind will find the final truth after leaving thebody.” Socrates believed that once the soul dissociates from the body afterdeath, we are able to engage in pure thought without any deceit from the senses.Stuart Hameroff puts it this way: “ . . . when the metabolism . . . is lost, thequantum information leaks out to the space–time geometry in the Universe atlarge. Being holographic and entangled, it doesn’t dissipate. Henceconsciousness (or dream-like subconsciousness) can persist.” image [images/00003.jpg] This chapter has tried to explain something not accepted by the mainstream interms of something else not accepted by the mainstream. Certainly, this is notthe best way to get the approval of the mainstream. Even more provocative, wemay challenge the following concepts belonging to the foundation of currentWestern rational thinking: * All information comes through the sensory organs, and we can know nothing that does not pass through the senses. * All we are is within our body. Our consciousness is compartmentalized by the skull, and is a product of our brain’s activity. * There is one unilayered reality. Only a person liberated from the overwhelming power of these dogmas canunderstand how the inside and outside paths will eventually converge inconsciousness, how by consistently looking inward we can go beyond, and howwithin becomes beyond. We may find similar claims and statements in New Ageliterature. Yet I come from a neuroscience background and am thus approachingthese issues from a scientific worldview. Nevertheless, if those who read thisfeel that their own basic tenets of viewing things have been threatened by thisdiscussion, then perhaps this chapter has fulfilled its goal.

The Topological Roots of Plant Consciousness and Interspecies Communication Ede Frecska, M.D. > Vegetalistas, like their counterparts, the Indian shamans of many indigenous> groups of the Upper Amazon, claim to derive healing skills and powers from> certain plant teachers, often psychoactive, believed to be their mother.> Knowledge, particularly medicinal knowledge, comes from the plants themselves;> the senior shaman only mediating the transmission of information . . . LUNA AND AMARINGO,AYAHUASCA VISIONS: THE ICONOGRAPHYOF A PERUVIAN SHAMAN In life sciences, plants are considered inferior organisms that passively adaptto different temperature, soil types, injuries, diseases, and physico-chemicaland biological conditions. You may ask, “So what? Plants are vegetables, aren’tthey?” At odds with the canonized scientific and commonly held layperson’s view,the traditional idea is of plants being more than helpless objects of elementaryforces; they are interactive or—even more—proactive, conscious beings. Theconcept of plant consciousness—in the form of plant spirits—can be traced backto the Middle Ages, and from there to a much earlier time. Even nowadays,aboriginal peoples on five continents believe that plants have spirits or thatcertain trees are inhabited by their ancestors, and, as the epigraph to thischapter indicates, they claim that knowledge can be acquired from plantteachers. The relationship between indigenous people and nature is based on shamanisticbeliefs that shape adaptive behavioral patterns and provide the foundation forsocial structures in tribal communities. In the belief system of indigenouscultures, every plant and animal, all forests and meadows, lakes and rivers,mountains and caves have a consciousness of their own. Such notions were castout entirely from the Western rational mind-set during the Scientific Revolutionand the Enlightenment. For the skeptic, these beliefs are ridiculoussuperstitions and expressions of primitive, magical thinking. That everything innature might have spirits and that some sort of sentience can be attributed toboth living creatures and material objects have been widespread beliefs formillennia in aboriginal cultures. We cannot, then, consider such persistent,transcultural tenets to be useless, primitive misconceptions that have noadaptive value at all and that reflect nothing relevant in nature. Is there any way to prove that animistic thinking is more than just purefiction, that it might contain some truth? Definitely not yet. The only thing wecan do in this chapter is to show a way toward rationalization by paying respectto what other people think and state about the world. Cultural relativism andlinear Darwinism are not necessarily to be believed: the former has a tendencyto give equal credit to every cultural accomplishment and the latter posits thatthe more we go back in time, the more we find primitive ways of thinking. Here in this chapter we also try to avoid the typical mistakes that passionateNew Age thinkers are prone to make. Recently, the concept of plant consciousnesshas received attention in New Age literature from plant healers, psychicmediums, and “green thumb” gardeners— those who claim to sense plants on subtlelevels and carry on meaningful communication with their spirits. Most of thetime, these writers discuss their uncontrolled experiences and speculative ideasin superficial ways, ignoring scientific scrutiny and bypassing peer-reviewedjournals. The result is that plant consciousness is not taken seriously bywell-established scientists, botanists, biologists, and ecologists, or respectedscholars of consciousness studies; its proponents are persona non grata in theexclusive club of mainstream science. DARWIN’S FORGOTTEN IDEA Because of the widespread assumption that neural networks are necessary forconsciousness, common sense does not allow for even the possibility that plantsare conscious. Hand in hand with the academic view, common sense tiesconsciousness to neuroaxonal organization but overlooks the possibility that“the Universe emulates itself on every level.”1[index_split_017.html#filepos860572] According to this notion, similarexperiences may result in other structures below, above, or on the same plane ofexistence. Charles Darwin did not overlook this possibility. In studying botany, he noticedthat root formations and the network of rootlets show organization similar tothat of human brain tissue. In his time, little was known about brain anatomyand information-processing in complex systems. Therefore, his observation hasbeen deemed superficial analogy and has not been taken more seriously. We mustkeep in mind that 90 percent of our current knowledge regarding brain functionhas been acquired only during the last two decades. Perhaps it is time toreexamine Darwin’s forgotten idea. Here we consider a representative sample ofaffirmative claims addressing plant consciousness. This chapter will analyze theconcept together with unorthodox views regarding animal communication andinterpret them within a topological model of consciousness, which goes beyondthe traditional neuroaxonal framework. PLANTS UNDER THE LIE DETECTOR A review of experiments conducted on plant consciousness and a criticalevaluation of their results may help us to form our own opinions regardingwhether plants are sentient, conscious beings. Cleve Backster, a leading experton polygraph machines, conducted pioneering studies in the field of plantconsciousness. In 1966, he introduced polygraph research into an entirely newarea by hooking up a Dracaena cane plant to a polygraph machine in order todetect its rate of water consumption.2 [index_split_017.html#filepos860745]Backster was interested in how fast water travels from the plant’s roots all theway up to the leaves, and thought that the polygraph could indicate the risingof the water by noting changes in plant-surface resistance. He noted that theplant showed unexpected responses as he moved the Dracaena around thelaboratory, with reactions resembling human galvanic skin responses. Struck bythis surprising finding, he applied different stimuli to the plant. Once, hedecided to burn one of his plant’s leaves. When Backster even thought aboutsetting fire to a leaf, he faced the following reaction: “Then at thirteenminutes, fifty-five seconds chart time, the imagery entered my mind of burningthe leaf I was testing. I didn’t verbalize, I didn’t touch the plant, and Ididn’t touch the equipment. The only new thing that could have been a stimulusfor the plant was the mental image. Yet the plant went wild. The pen jumpedright off the top of the chart.” He assumed that the plant somehow sensed his intentions and showed signs ofdistress. Pretending did not work; in order to get strong galvanic reactionsfrom the plant, his intentions had to be serious. Backster’s plant was not onlyconcerned with his hostile plans toward them, but also seemed to be empatheticwith regard to the suffering of others: when he caused harm to other livingorganisms, his plant responded strongly to these other beings’ distress.Distance was not an issue; remote perception seemed to be at work: Backstercould leave a plant alone while he sat in a bar and talked with friends, and thepolygraph device would indicate the plant’s reactions to the mood changes he wasexperiencing during the conversation. Independence from distance has also beenreported in publications of prayer experiments: plants at remote locations thathad been prayed for did better than nearby plants that were ignored.3[index_split_017.html#filepos861017] Marcel Vogel also noticed that distance didnot affect his results.4 [index_split_017.html#filepos861249] Galvanicrecordings of plants connected to a polygraph machine correlated with theexperimenter’s emotions and actions even when the plants and the human weremiles apart, as in Backster’s case. Cleve Backster concluded that plants have primary perception ability, asindicated by polygraph tests; otherwise, how could the galvanic responses havevaried so abruptly, and in accordance with events happening in theirsurroundings? Backster was careful to avoid the para-psychologically chargedterm extrasensory perception, because he did not see that, in the first place,plants have senses as we usually understand them. Nevertheless, the scientific community at large has not accepted the work ofBackster and his followers. Most of the academic researchers were unable toreplicate their results. The problem with studies of this kind is that usuallythe investigator is as much a part of the experimental setting as the testedplant itself. Those who side with Backster may argue that the sensitivity of thehuman involved is critically important. An attitude of rigorous analyticaldistancing can be the reason for the failure of many objective experiments withplants. According to Vogel, there is “a precise and important interactionbetween the experimenter and the plant which is equal in importance to theequipment being used.”5 [index_split_017.html#filepos861503] He suggested thatin successful human–plant communication, human beings must assume the role ofactive agent by “sensitizing” the plant to be receptive to human attitudes andemotions. SMART VEGETABLES Even if primary perception does exist in plants, this does not necessarily meanthat plants are conscious. We may interpret most of plant behavior asinstinctive, but this term is as vague—if not more so—than the concept ofconsciousness itself. If (as Rupert Sheldrake suggests) there is a trend incurrent knowledge to grant animals some level of consciousness due to the signsof self-awareness, deceptive skills, and cooperative behavior observed in manyanimal species, why should we not attribute to plants some sort of consciousnessfor similar reasons? Indeed, there are plant experiments with results that point in just thisdirection. Experiments with Ambrosia roots have indicated that these plants arecapable of self-recognition through differentiation between self and nonself, anability that has been considered by some as basic for self-aware beings: theroot system of the Ambrosia plant detects and avoids other Ambrosia plants andplants of different species, indicating self-recognition. The mechanism thathelps the plant differentiate between the roots of other plants and its own isunknown, but can be interpreted on a molecular level. Likewise, it is essentialfor the human immune system to differentiate between self and nonself bychemical means, without resorting to conscious processes. Further, as far asdefensive tactics are concerned, there are flowers that detect the approach ofpests that visit to steal their nectar, and react by closing up when theseinsects are nearby. Plants can orient themselves in space, as indicated by their coordinatedmovements when they are searching out objects or avoiding obstacles. In anenvironment where a plant is growing, it will grow toward hidden support andentirely ignore areas without potential support. Plants are able to “run” a mazefor light, as laboratory animals do for food: in a mazelike structure withseveral blind alleys, a vine planted at the closed, dark end can find its waytoward the light at the far end without making an error. In addition, we mightwatch our words if a plant is nearby! Early on, some researchers noticed thatboth speaking nicely to plants and verbally abusing them influence theirgrowth.6 [index_split_017.html#filepos861629] This observatio was latercorroborated by others: Hoffman reported that tomato plants exposed to gentlyspoken words on a daily basis produced 23 percent more tomatoes than controlplants, which had identical treatment but were not spoken to.7[index_split_017.html#filepos861836] Perhaps it is not the words but thepositive intent that plants perceive, for psychic healers claim to influenceseed germination significantly by adding “positive energy” to the process.8[index_split_017.html#filepos862112] To those who might think that this review is either getting close to or goingover the edge regarding the concept of plant consciousness, here is an excerptfrom the communication with a corn deva,*9 [index_split_016.html#filepos813673]or spirit, as channeled by Robert Shapiro. This indicates how much some psychicsattribute superhuman intelligence to devas. > I am the plant you refer to as corn. I speak to you as the Deva associated> with our superconsciousness, the Corn Goddess. I have a very strong spiritual> body that not only connects me cosmically to my point of origin but also> embraces the earth as a nurturing parent. When I am planted in a field, I> choose to feel every row and plant as a unit. Therefore, I do not experience> spatial references in the same way as you; I feel myself as the entire field> of plants. When an area of corn is accidentally destroyed, some element of> protest is expressed from the rest of the corn. Corn shrivels a bit or makes a> sound that only the observant farmer notices. I do not shrink out of fear;> instead I understand that I am here to sustain you. I am prepared, at any> moment, to offer myself in support of my true purpose on this planet. I have a> sense of touch similar to that of the human being. I know when I am touched,> and I am aware when someone or something is near that is not of my own kind. I> have a strong energy field that radiates with an awareness of up to six feet.> I have an ability to respond to the change in weather conditions and to the> changes from day to night.9 [index_split_017.html#filepos862613] If we put aside the notion that Shapiro’s channeling may have become tainted bysome New Age terminology and an agenda during the “download” process, and notein addition that the claims of indigenous shamans and contemporary psychics arevalid, then we may entertain the possibility that plants not only have some sortof consciousness, but also are extremely intelligent and resourceful beings.Notwithstanding, this consciousness must be very different from our own in thatonly very special humans are able to recognize it. Thus, it can be easily missedby insensitive analytical approaches. It is possible that our prejudicialmind-set, overadapted nature, and lack of sensitivity have led to a diminishedability to recognize consciousness in any form other than our own. BEYOND THE HORSE’S MOUTH Amelia Kinkade, author of the book Straight from the Horse’s Mouth,10[index_split_017.html#filepos862845] is an internationally renowned professionalinterspecies communicator. In this book, she shares her expertise with allreaders and assumes that everyone harbors a dormant innate ability tocommunicate with animals wordlessly and without gestures. She is certain thatthe only barrier separating people from any other animal is skepticism. To begin communicating effectively, we must tap into our clairsentience (sensingor feeling of a being’s energy) and believe that an animal’s feelings matter.The next step involves using clairaudience—that is, learning how to see picturesin an animal’s mind and then exchange images with the animal. Also available tous is a sort of X-ray imaging process that can be used to get inside an animal’sbody to determine the source or cause of illness or to find a missing pet. Allof these involve intuition whose function is increased by guided imagery,meditation, and other exercises. In using these types of intuition, claimsKinkade, we can literally learn to talk with pets—sharing memories or makingplans with them, negotiating house rules, mediating sibling rivalries,diagnosing illness, tracking a disappearance, accepting one another’sdifferences, and finding each other again. Apollo 14 Astronaut Captain EdgarMitchell concurs: “Amelia Kinkade’s rapport with animals of all species is quiteamazing and consistent. Her talent and effort is helping to overturn centuriesof false beliefs about the feelings, understanding, and mind states of ouranimal friends.” The zoologist Donald Griffin, who has performed research in animal behavior atHarvard, is skeptical about interspecies communication of the kind Kinkadediscusses, but agrees that animals are more than bundles of instincts andreflexes reacting to stimuli. In an interview with the New York Times,11[index_split_017.html#filepos863097] he said: “Animal thoughts and emotions arenot just a sentimental pet lover’s delusion.” His expert opinion reflects achange in academic thinking inspired by two broad cultural trends: theenvironmental movement’s emphasis on the importance of coexisting with ratherthan exploiting the natural world and the medical profession’s gradualrecognition of alternative therapies. “The climate is really changing,” says Rupert Sheldrake, a British biologist whohas developed the theory of morphic resonance and has written several books onanimal and plant development and behavior. “In the last ten years, there is agrowing recognition in the academic world that animals could be thought of ashaving minds and emotions. Scientists are beginning to take a look at what petowners already know.”12 [index_split_017.html#filepos863321] Rupert Sheldrake investigates the unexplained abilities of animals who seem tosense when their human companions are about to board an airplane or who know inadvance when they are approaching home unexpectedly, when a favorite person ison the other end of the telephone, or when someone is about to have an epilepticseizure. Sheldrake has collected more than three thousand case studies attestingto what at first glance appear to be strange coincidences. He has recordednearly two hundred instances of dogs, cats, horses, and even parrots predictingearthquakes. Sheldrake conducted an informal survey in England and the UnitedStates in which he asked one thousand pet owners whether they believed theirpets could communicate telepathically. Forty-eight percent of dog owners and 33percent of cat owners answered yes. More interesting still, he collected fifteenhundred anecdotes about “seemingly telepathic” messages that pets receivedsuccessfully from their owners but only 73 cases that flowed the other way.“People seem to be much less sensitive than their animals,” Sheldrake concluded.A lot of questions can be raised in response to such claims, but one of the mostpertinent is: What part of the brain can provide us and our pets with this kindof sensitivity? THE MATRIX RELOADED In chapter 7, we saw that information processing within the central nervoussystem occurs through hierarchically organized and interconnected networks. Thishierarchy of networks does not end at the neuroaxonal level, but alsoincorporates subcellular, cytoskeletal structures. When the size of thehierarchical components reaches the nanometer range and the number of elementsexceeds that of the neuroaxonal system, an interface emerges enabling atransition between neurochemical and quantum physical events. Signalnonlocality, accessed by means of quantum entanglement, is an essential featureof the quantum physical domain. We have discussed that this interface may implythat some manifestations of altered states of consciousness orunconscious\\conscious shifts have quantum origin with significantepistemological implications. Also in chapter 7, a second foundation of knowledge was calleddirect–intuitive–nonlocal information processing, which utilizes signalnonlocality based on quantum holography within the subcellular network of thebrain (and the whole body). This was suggested as a typical functional mode foraltered states of consciousness (ASCs) of the integrative type and wascontrasted with classical cognition, which was denoted as aperceptual–cognitive–symbolic method of acquiring knowledge and was regarded asthe main characteristic of the ordinary state of consciousness. Theperceptual–cognitive–symbolic form of information processing is capable ofmodeling via symbolism and is more culture-bound due to its psycholinguisticfeatures. The direct–intuitive–nonlocal mode, however, lacks symbolic mediation.Therefore, it has more cross-cultural similarity and is practically ineffableregarding classical cognition, though culture specific translation may occur inthis mode. Unavoidably, culture-specific, symbolic processes may shape theperceptual–cognitive–symbolic mode, and its framework is limited to a species,generally. In the remainder of this chapter, we will see how thedirect–intuitive–nonlocal method of accessing knowledge can cross overinterspecies distances, because its interface or the type of informationprocessing*10 [index_split_016.html#filepos814053] is shared not only bydifferent species, but also by every living creature. THE MATRIX REVOLUTION Networks are all the way up and networks are all the way down—as above, sobelow: biological organisms are built from a hierarchical organization ofcomplex, nonmonotonous networks. A network is considered nonmonotonous if it ismade of numerous nonidentical elements connected by diverse interactions. Thesefeatures define the basis of complexity, and make any kind of nonmonotonousnetwork capable of information processing. They also possess some sort ofconscious-ness—that is, responsiveness, awareness to, and storing of imprints ofchanges in the ambient environment. A fishnet is monotonous, and regardless ofthe number of its building blocks, it is dumb. Yet this is probably not true inthe case of the web of root fibers, microtubules, and other sub-or supracellularnetworks, which can contain a high degree of complexity. Also, complex networksystems are not restricted to biological organisms. The network hierarchy goesbeyond biological boundaries and can be found in nature on both the micro-(e.g.,spinor networks) and the macroscale (e.g., Earth’s electromagnetic flux tubes),potentially serving as storage for information at each level. Chapter 7 introduced the Penrose-Hameroff model, which postulates the use of thesubneural net of microtubules for quantum computation in biological systems. Atthe same time, the previous chapter emphasized that there remain shortcomings inthis intriguing model: despite their impressive intricacy, microtubules may betoo coarse to be used in an explanation for the emergence of consciousness—ofwho we really are. In fact, microtubules do not form the finest texture ofsubcellular organization. Even smaller and more-subtle structures branch andinterconnect in networks comprising an “infoplasm,” the basic substance ofliving material.13 [index_split_017.html#filepos863448] The most delicatecytoskeletal system is the microtrabecular lattice, a web of microfilaments(biofibers) that are seven to nine nanometers in diameter. This represents thecurrent micro frontier, the “ground floor” of living-material organization. Ifthe periodic lattice of microtubules forms a network within a network ofneurons, then the microfilamental matrix is a network embedded in the network ofmicrotubules (see figure 8.1)! image [images/00033.jpg] Several arguments can be raised against the Penrose-Hameroff model and againstmany other models of biological quantum computation based on classical quantummechanics. First of all, they are merely theoretical, without any experimentalsupport. Especially pointed is the critique of Tegmark14[index_split_017.html#filepos863644] and others that the warm temperature of thebrain should prevent the material organization necessary for quantumcomputation. As part of the phenomenon called heat decoherence, Brownianmovement of particles in the infoplasm disturbs the elements that process thequantum bits (qubits). Due to the lack of effective error correction, iteventually may ruin the computation. In response to Tegmark’s criticisms, here is a parallel drawn for example andalso an alternative model discussed under the heading Topological QuantumComputation. 1. The electric ray fish has no coil, meaning that technological solutions can be entirely different in biological systems. 2. The brain may develop and maintain a Bose-Einstein condensate, some sort of superconductive state without the seemingly requisite ultracool medium. Or it may incorporate a resilient substrate with highly efficient error correction. Topological quantum computation represents a possible solution for the latter problem. TOPOLOGICAL QUANTUM COMPUTATION Essentially, quantum computational models are based on a theoretical ability tomanufacture, manipulate, and measure quantum states, to process qubits ofinformation encoded in the state of particles, which may be trapped ions, atomsheld inside silicon chips, or uniformly oriented molecules organized within themicrotubules. Both chips and microtubules face one big problem: They must becarefully shielded to protect them from decoherence. This is where quantum weaving in the microfilamental lattice enters theequation, and potentially eliminates altogether this problem of heatdecoherence. Vaughan Jones’s mathematical work15[index_split_017.html#filepos863978] has proved that knots can storeinformation. His ideas were developed further by physicists Edward Witten16[index_split_017.html#filepos864251] and Alexei Kitaev,17[index_split_017.html#filepos864521] both of whom pointed out that a braidedsystem of quantum particles can perform quantum computation. Using quantumparticles with just the right properties, braiding can efficiently carry out anyquantum computation in superfast time. Further, while traditional qubits areprone to decoherence, “braiding is robust: just as a passing gust of wind mayruffle your shoelaces but won’t untie them, data stored on a quantum braid cansurvive all kinds of disturbance.”18 [index_split_017.html#filepos864831] The basic flaw of current theories of quantum computation in biological systemsis that they are based on attempts to use concepts of conventional quantumtheory. The classical quantum measurement approach postulating the “collapse ofthe wave function” is unsatisfactory for consciousness studies.19[index_split_017.html#filepos865066] The demonstrated quantum weaving modelrepresents a newer physical approach known as topological geometrodynamics,which provides a greater perspective.20 [index_split_017.html#filepos865307] Weshould not be reductionistic with regard to considering length scales: MattiPitkanen believes that the universe is “emulating” itself in all length and timescales. Therefore, it is possible that quantum computations may be carried outin biologically relevant length scales. Pitkanen goes on: > A topological geometrodynamics-based model involves many elements which> represent new physics very essential for topological quantum computation. One> of the most fascinating possibilities is: time loops are in principle possible> by signaling to a geometric past so that arbitrarily long computations could> be made instantaneously by iteration in which a new run is initiated in the> past. If these loops are really possible, they would mean a complete> revolution. Problems which would require a computation of eternity would> become solvable. MIND KINKS, TOPOLOGICAL CONSCIOUSNESS, AND PLANT INTELLIGENCE Current efforts of artificial intelligence (AI) are aimed toward problemsolving, and they usually attempt to simulate cognition as it is processed inthe neuroaxonal system of the human brain. This method of developing AI ismodeled after the perceptual–cognitive– symbolic mode of gaining knowledge.While machines may exhibit this perceptual–cognitive–symbolic form ofintelligence, animals also possess the direct–intuitive–nonlocal form, becausethey share with humans the subneural mechanisms of quantum holography. But whatabout plants? Do they harbor a direct–intuitive–nonlocal mind, and only thatone? This controversial question arose after my personal discussion with DennisMcKenna at the home of Luis Eduardo Luna in Wasiwaska, Florianópolis, Brazil.Dennis told of a report that described a giant mushroom, Armillaria ostoyae,commonly known as a honey mushroom and sometimes called shoestring rot and foundin the Pacific Northwest (specifically, in Malheur National Forest, Oregon). Itis one of the biggest single organisms (or a colony having the same DNA) onEarth—an immense network of interwoven fungal fibers (mycelia) spanningtwenty-two hundred acres three feet underground and containing one square milein volume. The visible golden mushrooms aboveground are only the reproducingorgans, and therefore represent only the tip of the iceberg. Recently, an evenlarger Armillaria ostoyae covering more than eleven thousand acres was found inWashington state. Genetic tests indicate that fungi are more closely related toanimals and human beings than to other plants. Fungal mycelial fibers maydevelop a network of loops in much bigger numbers than the microfilamentalmatrix of the human brain. As the Inca discovered and used in their quipu recordings, information can beencoded in knots and threads. A quipu consists of plied, colored threads ofcords that store data in knots. It is a coded system that has yet to bedeciphered. Computation based on weaving is called topological,21[index_split_017.html#filepos865481] and a vast loop network may enable anorganism or superorganism to resonate with the world, resulting in a phenomenonwe could describe as topological consciousness. Paul Stamets writes, “Themycelium is an exposed sentient membrane, aware and responsive to changes in itsenvironment. . . . Interlacing mycelial membranes form, I believe, a complexneuron-like web that acts as a fungal collective consciousness.”22[index_split_017.html#filepos865724] Besides Stamets, the McKenna brothers (Dennis and Terence) were among the firstoutspoken proponents of mushroom and plant consciousness—which we humans areable to tap in to in altered states of consciousness. Although plants cannotspeak because they lack a neuroaxonal system, they can be in deeper contact withthe world than we suppose, and are able to communicate with us.23[index_split_017.html#filepos865965] When we use our topological(direct–intuitive–nonlocal) consciousness that’s hidden in the fabric of thesubcellular matrix, and we liberate it from the suppression of the overdominantperceptual–cognitive–symbolic cognition of ordinary consciousness through theuse of particular rituals, we can access the wisdom of the plant kingdom. The size of topological consciousness does not necessarily reach its peak at thegiant-mushroom level. Threads—loops on every scale—can form a topology emergingin consciousness. Pando (or the Trembling Giant) is a clonal colony of a singlemale aspen tree (Populus tremuloides) located in the state of Utah, determinedto be part of a single living organism as revealed by identical genetic markersand the existence of one massive underground root system. The plant is estimatedto weigh six thousand tons, making it the heaviest known organism in existence.The root system of Pando, at eighty thousand years old, is thought to be one ofthe oldest known living beings in existence. The giant marine plant Posidoniaoceanica has been discovered in the Mediterranean Sea (near the Spanish BalearicIslands) and has a length of several miles and an estimated age of about onehundred thousand years. We can only imagine the kind of topological wisdom heldby a plant such as Pando or this marine organism. What’s more, the majority ofplants on Earth with interconnected root fibers may represent a form oftopological superconsciousness, the Gaian mind. A huge network of plants—likethe Internet—shares information on changes in the environment, and possesses aform of intelligence that only a few of us can recognize. In an alternative model based on his theory of topological geometrodynamics,Pitkanen24 [index_split_017.html#filepos866277] proposes that the flux tubes ofEarth’s magnetic field and the magnetic field of all living systems are anetwork of superconductors. These flux tubes might be a kind of nervous systemnot only of the entire biosphere, but also of the whole Blue Planet, and theymight make it possible to access an enormous amount of information from Earth’spast, present, and future. Electromagnetic flux tubes can serve as a medium formeaningful communication among plants, animals, humans, and—fasten your seatbelts—material objects and nonliving entities such as rocks, caves, rivers, andlakes. With Pitkanen’s model, perhaps it is possible to understand (and evenexperience) every entity to which indigenous peoples attribute spirit: animals,plants, and minerals. image [images/00003.jpg] This chapter represents an exploration into unknown territory—the netherworld ofplant and animal consciousness. Perhaps it is indeed possible to approachrationally and to study seriously questions of plant consciousness andtelepathic communication with animals. It is hoped that the information in thischapter will help us to interpret the mystery of our symbiotic relationship withthe plant world and why shamans of the Upper Amazon are adhering to absolutetruth in their statements regarding obtaining knowledge from plants themselveswith the help of ayahuasca and while in highly altered states of consciousness. "},{"pageContent":"image [images/00004.jpg] 9image [images/00004.jpg] Close Encounters of the Ancient Kind and Spontaneous DMT Release Ede Frecska, M.D. For millennia, encounters with divine, otherworldly entities have been among themost profound human experiences, expressed in visions and prophecies, omens andoracles, dreams and revelations. Divine encounters were recorded in the earliestscriptures and reveal the most ancient and most powerful drama that spansheaven, Earth, and hell. On the stage of this drama the actors were gods andgoddesses, demigods and angels, heroes and heroines, humans and humanoids. Theencounters with divine beings had immense power, affecting both the life ofindividuals experiencing them and communities hearing reports of them. Theseencounters were the first spiritual illuminations, transformative experiencesthat had an incredible impact on human affairs, changing the fate of rulers,building or ruining empires, inspiring prophets, and sprouting world religions. Divine encounters can be considered the primary source of spiritual wisdom.While all religious individuals would agree that scripture provides theinfallible rule for faith and practice, most believers also agree that authenticdivine encounters carry an even higher authority than holy scripture. Accordingto the Hebrew manuscripts, God communicated to Moses through a revelation, notin writing—the scripture merely followed the experience of the Divine. As Godsaid to Moses (Exodus 24:12, Masoretic Text version): “Come up to Me into themount and be there; and I will give thee the tables of stone, and the law andthe commandment, which I have written, that thou mayest teach them.” This citation refers to one of the greatest moments in the history of humancivilization. There were others, and the most significant developmental steps inancient history were based on divine encounters. By opening doorways to thesupernatural, divine encounters expose a great degree of truth and moralinsight. The state of mind of those who experience such encounters is undeniablyaltered from the ordinary state of consciousness. Further, these encounters arereflected in the nonordinary perceptions, intense emotional responses, andexceptional cognitive performances accompanying such experiences. Earlier, we discovered the difference between integrative and disintegrativeforms of altered states of consciousness (ASCs) and traced the main differencebetween them to the lack or presence of divination, which is conceived as aprocess of accessing transformative information from spiritual realms. Amongintegrative ASCs, divine encounters represent the uppermost level and haveimmense power in facilitating human reintegration on the highest scale: they cancreate civilizations and shape societies in accord with the spiritual realm.Just as in the less dramatic although highly adaptive forms ofpsychointegration1 [index_split_017.html#filepos866609] such as shamanichealing, in which some kind of restorative information is incorporated into thesystem to be treated, in the instance of divine encounters there must be anintense information flow that results in integration on a larger scale, denotedhere as sociointegration (paraphrasing Winkelman’s term psychointegration). Thesociointegrative form of divine encounters is so profound and transforming thatrational thinking cannot cope with it, leading to speculative interpretationsrelating to extraterrestrial intervention, invasion from outer space, ormanipulation by nonhuman intelligence. For those who have successfully wrestled other chapters here, it is easier tounderstand that shamanic journeys and divine encounters have the same principalmotif: access to reintegrative, transformative information from spiritualsources that in our opinion appear to originate in the nonlocal universe. Thischapter will guide us through other theories dealing with nonhuman invaders fromthe local universe, or extraterrestrial information providers of the human race. RAMBAN’S CONUNDRUM Moses Ben Nachman (1194–1270), also known as Ramban or Nachmanides, was amedieval scholar, Catalan rabbi, influential kabbalist, biblical commentator,and great thinker of his time. He lived in a prosperous era of the history ofthe Jewish religious tradition. Two prominent schools of Jewish culture existedin medieval Europe: the Tzorfat School, headed by the world-renowned Bible andTalmud commentator Rabbi Solomon Ben Isaac (referred to as Rashi), and theSephardic School, headed by a group of brilliant scholars including Rabbi JudahBen Samuel Halevi, Moses Ben Maimon (Maimonides), and Ramban himself. Ramban wasnot only an influential follower and critic of Maimonides’s rationalism, but atthe same time he developed the ideas of kabbalah and used some of them in hiscommentaries on the Bible. Though Ramban was the first kabbalist to openly discuss the esoteric doctrinesof kabbalah, he had always considered that the deep kabbalah teachings were onlyfor the chosen ones, and many times he evaded open explanations of his ideas,noting that there was a secret behind the text and its interpretation. One ofRamban’s enigmas was the “Nephilim secret.” The English translation of theMasoretic Text of Genesis 6:4 says: “The Nephilim were in the Earth in thosedays, and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters ofmen, and they bore children to them; the same were the mighty men that were ofold, the men of renown.” Here is Ramban’s commentary to this verse of Genesis 6, found in the work ofMikra’ot Gedolot:2 [index_split_017.html#filepos866813] “But the Midrash PirkeiRabbi Eliezer, which is mentioned in the Talmud, treatise Yoma explains the word‘HaNphilim’ [Nephilim] as Messengers fallen from the sky. That is the bestcommentary for the verse Genesis 6:4. But to explain the secret contained inthis verse, it is necessary to write very much.”*11[index_split_016.html#filepos814329] Rashi commented similarly on Bereshith Rabbah: “They were called Nephilimbecause they fell [Naphlu] and caused the downfall [Hipilu] of the world.” Laterinterpreters stated that the Nephilim were so called because the heart of manfell from fear of them. That was a necessary shift from Ramban’s version,because such an idea was very dangerous for both the ruling Christians and theaccepted Jewish ideology. According to Matest Agrest,3[index_split_017.html#filepos867019] however, “for the contemporary reader it isevident that Ramban sees in this verse a record of the descending of manlikemessengers from another world to the Earth, that is, paleocontact.” PALEOCONTACT THEORIES The advocates of these notions propose that advanced extraterrestrials haveplayed an influential role in human history. The originator of this idea isMatest Agrest, a Russian-born ethnologist and mathematician who was the first toadvance a theory that intelligent beings from outer space visited Earth inancient times and that certain monuments of past cultures on Earth have resultedfrom contact with an extraterrestrial race. It was in an article printed onFebruary 9, 1960, in the Russian Literaturnaya Gazeta (not a scientific journal)where Agrest proposed that Earth was visited by extraterrestrials in prehistorictimes. His concept was very soon circulated in the world media, and waspopularized later by Erich von Däniken. Because of his experience ininvestigating old manuscripts, Agrest noticed that the Hebrew word image[images/00034.jpg] (Nephilim) contains the core relevant concept, but is onlytransliterated into English. In several translations, the word image [images/00034.jpg] (Nephilim) isdeciphered as “giants” or “titans.” Agrest’s aim is to demonstrate that thetranslation of the Hebrew word Nephilim as “giant” in Genesis 6:4 is incorrect.According to Agrest, the correct meaning of Nephilim is “beings fallen” (fromthe sky). Therefore, Agrest believes that this verse reports that in the time ofEnoch, extraterrestrial humanlike beings descended to Earth. Thus, Genesis 6:4becomes a written document of paleocontact. By rediscovering one of Ramban’scommentaries on Genesis 6, Agrest introduces a misinterpretation that has becomewidespread in science-fiction literature and on the Internet: that the Nephilimare the fallen angels. Also in Genesis, Agrest found a sentence he interpreted as an opposite event:the ascension of a man from Earth to the heavens. The sentence refers to Enochand is found in Genesis 5:24: “Enoch walked with God, then he was no more, forGod took him.” The Bible informs us meticulously of the age of death of all theancient ancestors, but there is no note about the death of Enoch. There is aJewish legend that he was the inventor not only of the written language, butalso of mathematics and astronomy. In the Qur’an (Sura 19:56), Enoch is namedIdris—a man of truth. According to the Zohar, the masterpiece of kabbalah, there was a Book of Enochin ancient times, and it was mentioned by the apostle Jude as apocryphal. Likemany other apocrypha, the Book of Enoch was lost until it was rediscovered bythe Scottish explorer James Bruce in 1773. It follows the structure of theBible—indeed, the first seven chapters of the discovered Book of Enoch areessentially the same as those in the Bible—and Agrest uses verses 1–7 in chapter6 as reference for his paleocontact theory: 1. And it came to pass that after the eons of men multiplied in those days (the days of Jared, the father of Enoch) . . . 2. And the angels, the sons of heaven, saw them. . . . 3. There were two hundred of them in all. 4. And they descended on Ardis which is the top of the mountain Hermon. . . . 5. and here are the names of their superiors [twenty names are given]. Here Agrest correlates the location of the place of descending, Mount Hermon,and the time of descending, the time of Jared. It is worth noting that the nameJared in Hebrew means “descended.” The event of descending of humanoid beingsfrom the sky supposedly made a great impression on the inhabitants of Earth. Inbiblical times, children born at the time of a remarkable event were named afterthe event. Thus, the name of Enoch’s father was Jared. So—Agrest posits—it ispossible that the divine beings fallen from the sky who are mentioned in chapter6 of Genesis really descended from the mountain of Hermon in the time of Jared. Another element of the paleocontact view is the suggestion that much of humanwisdom or religion was given by space invaders in ancient times. Thispossibility has been considered by some scientists, including Carl Sagan and theRussian astronomer Iosif Shklovsky. Although Sagan, Shklovsky, and other highlyregarded academics took seriously the possibility of extraterrestrialvisitations in Earth’s past, they were generally cautious in their speculations.While Sagan was known as a skeptic with rergard to the existence of UFOs, in thebook he coauthored with Shklovsky4 [index_split_017.html#filepos867321] heargues that technologically advanced extraterrestrial civilizations were commonin the universe, and he considers it very probable that Earth had been visitedseveral times in the past. Popular authors, most notably Erich von Däniken5[index_split_017.html#filepos867548] and Zecharia Sitchin,6[index_split_017.html#filepos867778] appear to be less critical in theirapproach, and they have been the most outspoken advocates of theancient-astronaut hypothesis. Indeed, this ancient-astronaut theory, anexpansion and perhaps a less credible elaboration of the paleocontact theory,often claims that human beings are either the descendants or creations of alienswho landed on Earth millennia ago. Our purpose here is to discover what might be relevant in the sometimesremarkable and sometimes outlandish theories of von Däniken and Sitchin and toclarify the pros and cons of the ancient-astronaut theory. In doing so, we willdraw upon the work of Rick Strassman and of the ancient religion expert MichaelHeiser, which provides additional insights into UFO encounters (figure 9.1). image [images/00035.jpg] THE FALL OF THE FALL OF THE NEPHILIM There has been a great deal written about the meaning of the Hebrew wordNephilim. Many—like Agrest and Sitchin—have accepted the idea that the wordNephilim is simply the masculine plural participle of the Hebrew naphal, “fall.”According to Michael Heiser, a well-read linguist of Near Eastern languages anda stern critic of Sitchin, practically all of these interpreters—even manyscholars of the Hebrew scriptures, Ramban included—are wrong, because thetypical explanation that Nephilim comes from the Hebrew naphal does not fit withHebrew morphological patterns for a masculine plural participle in any stem. The ancient Hebrew language was originally written without vowels. Around thesixth century BCE, however, Hebrew began to use certain consonants for vowelsounds. The reason for this historical development was the preservation ofcorrect pronunciation: at the time of the Babylonian exile, Hebrew was beinglost as a spoken tongue; vowels were incorporated into the system to teachpeople to read correctly. Conflicting interpretations may derive from the use ofdifferent missing vowels associated with the same consonants in ancientscriptures. Michael Heiser eloquently shows us that the form of the word Nephilim does notderive either from the active or passive participle of the Hebrew naphal andcannot mean “those who fall,” “those who fall upon,” or “fallen ones.”7[index_split_017.html#filepos867977] These meanings do not match the form andthe form does not match these meanings. Nor were Nephilim given the designationof “fallen” because of some inherently fallen spiritual state (as in OriginalSin, which led to the expulsion from Eden). Heiser indicates that there is goodreason to return to and accept the earlier version of scripture. His conclusionis that the word Nephilim is better interpreted from the Aramaic noun naphil as“giants” or “titans,” as the name was interpreted in conventional translationsof the Bible. Even more, according to Heiser, the word Nephilim does not describe a humanrace. In the Hebrew scriptures, family lines or races of people were generallydesignated by their founding male ancestor. For example, the Anakim weredescendants of Anak and the Edomim (Edomites) originated from Edom (one ofEsau’s names in the Hebrew scriptures). Yet the Nephilim have never beendescribed as being descended from anybody. Because the Bible describes them bothbefore and after the Deluge, if the Nephilim were humans, then it wouldcontradict the rest of scripture, which, as 1 Peter 3:20 shows, indicatesclearly that there were only eight survivors of the Flood: “[I]n the days ofNoah, during the construction of the ark, in which a few, that is, eightpersons, were brought safely through the water.” Zecharia Sitchin leans toward the “fallen” explanation, because his purpose isto prove the idea that the Nephilim were extraterrestrials who descended toEarth in rocket ships. For this same reason, he keeps arguing, despite lackingconsistent textual evidence, that the Nephilim are the Sons of God. Though thisconclusion and extrapolation may be a bit off the mark, as we will see here,with reasonable support of experts, it is very likely that our ancestorswitnessed humanlike beings arriving from the skies. Yet it was not the Nephilimwho descended from heaven. Instead, it was the Sons of God, and the Nephilimwere their offspring. THE SONS OF GOD, THE WATCHERS In addition to the puzzling origin of the Nephilim, the identity of the Sons ofGod is a mystery of Genesis 6—and the two riddles are related. Modern-daycommentators suggest that the term Sons of God refers to a tribe ofexceptionally tall, good-looking men who appeared in biblical lands and wereappealing to women. At variance with contemporary views, ancient rabbisascertained that the Sons of God were angels. For argument, the rabbis broughtup the prologue of the Book of Job, in which God has a dialogue with two angels,Samyaza and Azazel, who condemn the corrupt ways of men. The angels convince God to let them descend to Earth to prove theirrighteousness. When they do, they are immediately filled with desire for thebeautiful daughters of men: “ . . . the sons of God saw the daughters of menthat they were fair; and they took them for wives, whomsoever they chose.” Theoffspring of these unions are denoted by the word Nephilim, which has beenbetter interpreted to mean “giants,” rather than “fallen angels,” because theywere not “fallen ones,” though their heavenly predecessors were. Though Genesis 6 tells us that the heavenly ones married women, it does notcondemn this as a sin. Here, the Sons of God are given no specific name orfunction; they could represent fallen angels or simply divine beings that matedwith earthly women. The Sons of God also appear in Psalm 82 and in theapocryphal books of Enoch and Jubilees, in which they are perpetrators of evildeeds and inclinations. Psalm 82 tells that the angels (plural elohim) sinned,but does not tell how—that is, it does not mention that they married humanfemales. Some scholars suppose that the angels’ sin was reproducing withmortals. In the Book of Enoch, the Sons of God are called Watchers, angelsdispatched to Earth simply to watch over human affairs. Samyaza, Azazel, and theothers failed in their duty, became corrupt, and taught their human hosts tomake metals, weapons, cosmetics, and other accoutrements of civilization thathad been kept secret in heaven. According to the Book of Enoch, the Watchersnumbered two hundred (but only their leaders were named)—the size of their groupwas large enough for a heavenly congregation. DIVINE COUNCIL IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN It is well known to scholars of the Hebrew scriptures that scripture oftendepicts God presiding over a council of divine beings.8[index_split_017.html#filepos868297] A number of passages in the Hebrew Bibledescribe the divine council’s function with precise terminology, and a pictureemerges that is rather different from that held by the Christian tradition. In abiblical scene, God is pictured as the chief deity enthroned among the membersof his council standing before him, and the members of this heavenlyassembly—the Sons of God—who serve to emphasize and execute God’s decisions.According to scripture, there has been a heavenly council of spiritual beingsthat has influence over our world—yet for nearly the past two millennia, therehas been a general misunderstanding of the way God governs human affairs. Asingular God (Elohim) leads a divine council consisting of other, less powerfulgods (plural elohim), and the Garden of Eden was their meeting place. Instead ofbeing a place of human habitation, this garden was reserved as a divine abode;God put Adam there “to till it and to keep it,” possibly in service of theheavenly council. According to some scholars, Genesis 1:26 indicates that the Sons of God werepresent during the week of Creation: Genesis 1:26 states, “. . . [A]nd God said:‘Let us make man in our image, after our likeness . . .’” and Job 38:6, 7, says,“Whereupon were the foundations thereof fastened? Or who laid the corner-stonethereof, when the morning stars sang together, and all the Sons of God shoutedfor joy?” To make matters more complicated, though, there were malevolentspiritual powers in the heavens that influenced humankind, teaching humans evilthings and opposing God’s people. As Paul wrote in Ephesians 6:12: “For we donot wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers,against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts ofwickedness in the heavenly places.” Discovering in the Bible that godlike beings, Sons of God, already existed fromthe time of creation and were governing humans—at times with dubious intent—doesnot require us to view Israelite religion as polytheistic, but definitely pointstoward a Sumerian influence on the Book of Genesis. THE SUMERIAN CONNECTION As far as we know today, Sumer (the biblical Shinar) is where civilizationbegan, appearing suddenly about six thousand years ago in the delta of theTigris and Euphrates Rivers, though there is some disagreement about itsprimacy, because Jericho in Israel is eleven thousand years old and is thoughtto be the oldest city in the world. In any case, the Sumerian civilization leftthe oldest written records we have and seemed to be thriving several hundredyears before the Egyptians (4000 BCE for Sumer civilization and 3500 BCE forEgyptian civilization). Both cultures have much in common, however—though thereare many differences between the two. We may find that both derived from acommon antecedent civilization. Zecharia Sitchin, the pioneer of research into the Sumerian past, writespassionately—for good reason—about the accomplishments of the Sumerian culture: > It gave Humankind almost every “first” in all that matters as integral> components of a high civilization—not just the first brick making . . . but> also the first high-rise temples and palaces, the first priests and kings; the> first wheel, the first kiln, the first medicine and pharmacology; the first> musicians and dancers, artisans and craftsmen, merchants and caravaneers, law> codes and judges, weights and measures. The first astronomers and> observatories were there, and the first mathematicians. And perhaps most> important of all: it was there, as early as 3800 BCE, that writing began,> making Sumer the land of the first scribes who wrote down on clay tablets in> the wedge-like script (“cuneiform”) the most astounding tales of gods and> humans. Scholars regard these ancient texts as myths. We, however, consider> them to be records of events that have essentially happened.9> [index_split_017.html#filepos868535] Many authors have also noticed that the Bible might have been influenced byancient Sumerian stories, because many verses in the Book of Genesis, forexample, are found much earlier in Sumerian and Babylonian tablets—but in moreexpanded and detailed form. Sumerians had stories similar to those that appearin Genesis 1–11. Some of the influential Sumerian texts are the Enuma Elish(Epic of Creation), the King List, and the Flood story. In these texts arewell-elaborated stories of Sumerian gods and goddesses, with the key motifsreappearing in the myths of almost every ancient Near Eastern culture. Manyadopted some of these Sumerian stories and wrote them down as best they couldwithout having direct access to the original tablets. Because of this, thestories went through a transformation over time. In addition, mistranslationsand errors accumulated because of the different languages and influences ofindividual translators who placed their own stamp on them. It is likely thateven the honorable scribes of the Hebrew Bible were not immune to these errors.Yet all these ancient depictions augment the biblical narrative, and paint adetailed picture of a course of events with identifiable principal participants(though their names differ in different versions) who come together in the sagaof divine encounters. Academic scholars by and large persist in calling all suchevidence fiction or mythology. The merit of Sitchin lies in the fact that he was one of the first who noticedthat certain texts have an older origin than the Hebrew Bible, and he gavecredit to these stories by considering them as records of real, historicalevents. Indeed, those events may have happened, but let us look for the scene ofthe almighty drama in a different domain of reality. Who were these Sumeriandeities, the protagonists of the earliest written stories? Were they just actorsof mythical legends, as we judge them today? Or were they—as some scholars arebeginning to believe—real beings who were somehow superior to the commonSumerians? Were they considered gods because they did incomprehensible thingsthat even today we would see as godlike? Prior to addressing these questions,let us turn to the most enigmatic Sumerian deities: the Anunnaki. THE ANUNNAKI There is much confusion among researchers, scholars, and laypeople about theidentity of the Anunnaki. What most agree on is that the Anunnaki wereworshipped, admired, and feared as gods by the Sumerians. It was the Anunnakiwho taught the people a wide array of “civilized behaviors” such as art, music,poetry, astronomy, mathematics, architecture, mining, metallurgy,jewelry-making, tailoring, blacksmithing, human sacrifice, and warfare. As theancient lore indicates, they also engaged in evil behavior, and were demotedfrom the heavens. According to Sitchin’s interpretation of the ancient Sumerian texts, the nameAnunnaki literally means “those who from heaven to Earth came.” According toHeiser, however, this is not correct. His translation is “princely offspring.”As sons of Anu (The Heavenly One), they were high in rank, but some of them werelater consigned to the netherworld and were turned into “infernal gods.” AsSitchin tells it, the Anunnaki arrived on our planet from outer space with theorder of Anu (The Heavenly One) under the leadership of Ea (He Whose House IsWater), later called Enki (Lord of Earth), and here they established a colonynamed Eridu (House in the Faraway Built). The extraterrestrial visitors’ missionwas obtaining gold, which they needed on their home planet, Nibiru. Thecolonization did not go well. More and more Anunnaki had to travel to Earth, andin the end their number reached six hundred. About half of them, the group ofthe Igigi (Those Who Observe and See), remained skyborne, fulfillinginterplanetary liaison-type functions. Enki, who also served as the chief scientist of the Anunnaki, had a solution forspeeding up the mission. He said: “Let us create a primitive worker, which willtake over the backbreaking toil.” Enki created the first intelligent worker froma hominid (proto–Homo sapiens) he found in southeast Africa. According toSitchin, he achieved the task by mixing the blood of a young Anunnaki male withthe egg of a female hominid. The fertilized egg was then inserted into the wombof a female Anunnaki, and after a tense waiting period a model man, Adamu, wasborn. Heiser’s interpretation of Sumerian texts is at odds with Sitchin’s: Acting asjudges in their high estate, the Anunnaki contributed nothing but approval tothe idea of killing one of the gods and making humans from his remains.According to Heiser, Sumerian tablets do mention hybridized human beings createdby a god with the approval of the Anunnaki. Directly or indirectly, Enki wasalso involved in the business of creating a royal race—the Nephilim in theHebrew Bible— for the purpose of keeping the upgraded hominids in slavery andensuring that they remained “civilized.” In some tales, the royalty was said tobe a combination of reptiles and humans. Who, then, were Enki and the Anunnaki? As readers may have figured out by now,Enki and the Anunnaki were the Sons of God, the fallen angels of the biblicaltexts. Actually, there were different classes of celestial beings who functionedin a divine hierarchy and eventually were caught up in spiritual warfare. TheHebrew Bible has laid it out quite well, but this story did not make it toEnglish translations. The description of the creation of humans can be extractedfrom the Hebrew scriptures and summed up briefly: Elohim said in front of theSons of God (the “fallen ones”): “Let us make Adam in our image, after ourlikeness.” Then, with the consent of the heavenly council, the task was carriedout: “And Elohim created Adam in his image.” The Elohim of Hebrew mythologycorresponds to Anu, and Enki—the keeper of knowledge—is undoubtedly the sourceof the biblical serpent in the Garden of Eden. Based on ancient descriptions,Sitchin has also suggested that the Anunnaki probably had some quasi-reptilianform. Figure 9.2 shows a statuette with clear reptilian features found at the AlUbaid archaeological site in Iraq. It belongs to the Ubaid period, dating from5900 BCE to 4000 BCE—predating the classical Sumerian era—and probably depictsthe mother goddess Inanna aka Ninhursag (Lady of the Mountaintop). There is noofficial explanation for the intriguing shape of the statuette. The figurine islabeled a “ritual object,” common parlance in archaeological circles when allare uncertain as to what a particular object represents. image [images/00036.jpg] Who were those Anunnaki who orbited in the skies and appeared in the Akkadianand Babylonian tales under the name Igigi? Igi refers to “eye” in Akkadian andis combined with the cuneiform gi, which symbolizes sexual intercourse. Igigican then be translated as “Eyes in the Sky”—the Watchers, who deflower sexually.Similar entities show up in dozens of ancient cultures. In ancient Greekmythology, there are Titans, godly beings who descended from heaven and who hadsexual intercourse with earthly women. Interestingly, the Greek word titanosmeans “gray,” a term sometimes used to describe mantislike aliens. As readersmay have guessed by now (and we summarize in Table 9.1), ancient peoples havetold us a complete story of UFO encounters and abductions that occurred probablyas far back as six thousand years ago—perhaps even more. The Britisharchaeologist Steven Mithen states in his book on human prehistory, After theIce: “[T]he possibility arises that the roots of Babylonian religion lie in theNeolithic culture of the Jordan valley around 6500 BC.”10[index_split_017.html#filepos868786] Based on the plaster statues found at the ‘Ain Ghazal excavation site in 1983,Mithen paints a ritual scene with a detailed description of deities: “They haveflattish bodies, elongated necks, large round faces, and wide-open eyes withdeep black centers. The noses are molded as stubs; the lips hardly exist at all.The plaster is pure white.” This sounds eerily like a description of aliens,though Mithen interprets them as ghosts. Controversial and contradictory as itmay sound, we conceptualize them differently: they were “real”extraterrestrials—though not necessarily from outer space. Instead, theseancient gods—possibly the teachers of agriculture—were DMT (dimethyltryptamine)entities that emerged from inner space. Strassman’s work indicates that at leastsome of the experiences involving UFO encounters are probably related to theeffect of the endohallucinogen compound DMT.11[index_split_017.html#filepos869039] Here we try to learn if a similarphenomenon might have occurred in ancient times, might have served as the sourceof creation myths, and might represent a different kind of reality, one that iscalled nonlocality elsewhere in this book.

At the beginning of this book, Harnerdescribes his first encounter with the DMT-containing psychedelic brewayahuasca. It is one of the best and richest illustrations of the typicalcharacteristics of the DMT experience (here appearing in bold). Themes that areparallel with mythical tales are emphasized in italics: > Overhead the faint lines became brighter, and gradually interlaced to form a> canopy resembling a geometric mosaic of stained glass.

He was surprised to find that these experiences wereneither unique nor extraordinary. The missionaries looked up correspondingpassages in chapter 12 of the Book of Revelation (e.g., “And the serpent castout of his mouth water as a flood . . . ”), and the shaman told him: “Oh,they’re always saying that [referring to the dragonlike creatures (snakes)stating they were to be the masters of humanity]. But they are only the mastersof outer darkness.” The Conibo shaman referred to outer space in his language,from his worldview, despite the fact that Harner had skipped that part of hisstory. With all respect to the blind shaman, however, he was wrong about thosedragonlike creatures. In Richard Dawkins’s book on the selfish genes,13[index_split_017.html#filepos869384] he points out that these genes are the truemasters of the planet, and “we humans were but the receptacles and servants ofthem.” Harner received a preview of Francis Crick’s DNA-based panspermiatheory14 [index_split_017.html#filepos869593] twelve years before itspublication! On another continent, in Africa, some tribes claim to bear extensive esotericknowledge of a race of reptiles that, they say, controls Earth. They also claimto have accounts of a reptilian race that created blacks and used them to worktheir gold mines—tales that are extremely similar to the accounts described byHarner and those outlined in the Sumerian tablets. How could people living underdifferent skies, on different continents, in different eras, and having verydifferent worldviews have common divine experiences? The effects of theendogenous psychedelic compound DMT may provide the clue. THE DMT CODE Summarized here are the typical effects of the DMT experience more or less in anorder of their appearance after DMT is administered intravenously. This list isbased on the pioneering work of Rick Strassman.15[index_split_017.html#filepos869825] The typical introductory symptoms at the onset of the DMT effect include hearingloud, rumbling, buzzing, pulsating noise. The tone can quickly shift to hissingwith a high-frequency pitch, and the sound is usually accompanied by feelingvibrations in the body, feeling a rush, feeling a wave of heat running throughthe body, feeling strange sensations in the bodily organs, and feeling power(some people perceive it as energy) entering or leaving the body. In this phase,visuals consist of seeing flickering, pulsating, bright light, followed bygeometric imagery, spirals, or zigzags (phosphenes). It is common to perceive a“presence,” sometimes with a pressure on the chest, as if someone invisible issitting on top of the body. Muscle paralysis, numbness, floating, andout-of-body experiences may occur in this phase. The DMT experience culminates in a sudden transition, as if breaking through awall or membrane, and this is sometimes preceded by hearing a crackling orbuzzing or clicking sound and the sense of being in an unusual world that feelssurreal and hyperrealistic at the same time. The visuals grow very complex,colors are much brighter than in ordinary reality, and strange entities appear:talking lizards; smart snakes; little people; angels; aliens; two-dimensional,cartoonlike forms that may penetrate the body of the subject (as in anoperation, implantation, or insemination), especially when he or she isresisting the experience. Ego-dissolution, the sense of falling apart, or fearof death overtakes those who try to resist the effect. For those who are able tolet go and surrender to the experience, a teaching time arrives, complete withthe entities’ mentoring. Subjects may feel that the aliens are telepathically“downloading” to them a good deal of pertinent information. Harner supposed hewas dying, tried to accept his fate, and then received those rich revelations.The quality of awareness changes, with the rise of a peculiar duality of realityorientation, the sense of being in two realms at the same time—that is, feelingthe sheet of the bed and the pressure of the pillow, at the same time being inthe alien world. It is not necessary to have all of these symptoms and in the same sequence; theexperience is highly variable, but the commonalities among experiences areremarkable. If similar symptoms occur without taking DMT externally, then theexperience may be the result of a spontaneous DMT release (see boxed pointsbelow). Dimethyltryptamine is an endohallucinogen; the brain has enzymes tosynthesize this powerful psychotropic chemical and has an active transportmechanism for taking it through the otherwise very restrictive filter of theblood–brain barrier. It is supposed that the pineal gland can be a source ofendogenous DMT. Strassman points out that spontaneous DMT release may provide arational explanation for UFO abductions and related phenomena. It is a strikingcoincidence that the majority of UFO encounters occur during the early-morninghours, when the pineal gland is the most active. Sleep paralysis—“old hagsyndrome”—may also be the consequence of a limited, mitigated form ofspontaneous DMT release. > --------------------------------------------------------------------------------> > The Main Characteristics of a Full-blown Spontaneous DMT Activity*12> [index_split_016.html#filepos814712]> > > > > 1.

In the 1980s, he had a series of spontaneous and then deliberateshamanistic experiences that revealed to him a dramatic future for humanity.Wesselman’s journeys were spontaneous ASCs of the integrative type occurringusually in the early-morning hours. He published his fascinating “intrapsychic”adventures and exciting discoveries in three consecutive books,16[index_split_017.html#filepos870005] which are on par with the writings ofCarlos Castaneda. Here are excerpts from his first encounter: > I . . . was just slipping off to sleep when I felt a peculiar sensation in my> body. As my dissolving attention re-formed and turned toward it, the feeling> abruptly intensified, paralyzing me where I lay. Startled, I opened my eyes. I> saw momentary spots of light interspersed with strange lines and zigzags> against the darkened field of the ceiling. A transparent arc seemed to> coalesce out of the lights, and then the bedroom disappeared. > I found myself in a forest in almost total darkness. Around me in all> directions, tall black tree trunks and branches stretched away into the night.> The night was very still, and a faint fragrance floated on the warm air. The> illusion was vividly real, and yet paradoxically, I could still feel myself> lying in bed next to Jill and hear her turning the pages of her book. I felt> very much awake. > . . . As my attention shifted back into the “dream” and the forest around me,> these sensations, these rushes of feeling, increased. At this point I> discovered that I could move, and I proceeded to walk through the trees,> profoundly impressed at how real everything appeared. I wasn’t too sure how I> was moving or what I was walking on, but as in a dream, my intention seemed to> be enough to take me here or there. My body in bed, however, was still> immobilized by the sensations. > . . . The sensations abruptly intensified, and my body swelled and stiffened,> becoming increasingly paralyzed, as though I were wrapped in an invisible fist> that was slowly squeezing me, cutting off my breath. For a moment, I worried> that I might be having a seizure of some sort, and I felt the edge of fear.> The fear departed as abruptly as it had appeared, however, when I realized> that the sensations were intensely pleasurable. Each increase in pressure was> accompanied by a euphoric surge mixed with an indescribable joy. > Something cut through my absorption in this overwhelming rapture and drew me> toward the trees to my right. There among the shadowy tree trunks I saw a> huge, dark form. It was vaguely manlike, and I could make out what I thought> was a distinct head and body, but the body was strangely geometric and. . . .> door-like. The head was rounded and small, there seemed to be no arms or legs.> It was flat, completely black, and featureless. > . . . The sensations continued to flow around and through me, exerting> pressure from both within and without. I tried to move but I was now> completely paralyzed. I heard Jill turn another page and thought to myself,> “I’ve got to try to tell her what’s happening,” but my jaw was locked, and my> entire body was as rigid as a stick of wood. I couldn’t close my hands. > . . . Abruptly, it seemed as if the shadow had increased the sensations so> much that I felt myself “lift off.” I drifted slowly up through the trees> until I was standing above the ground, turning slowly in space among the> leaves and flowers. The ecstatic sensations surged through and around me, and> my muscles shook, trembling with the force. To fight against the enormous> strength that enfolded me seemed absurd. The dark form was obviously immensely> strong, and yet it hadn’t harmed me. > I heard a roaring sound and waited to see what would happen next. Then as> abruptly as the experience began, it stopped. I was gently placed back on the> ground, and the dark form changed, shifting its shape to blend into the> shadows under the trees. Simultaneously, the sensations that had held me rigid> began to flow out of me in slow surges, each one less powerful than the last.> Progressively the trees, the shadow, and the bright sphere dissolved, and the> darkened bedroom reappeared before my eyes . . . the world was ordinary once> again. The first light of dawn was illuminating the sky. My mind was reeling. Wesselman had an encounter with an entity, a being that is known to NativeAmericans as a threshold guardian. In addition, the fingerprint of a DMT-inducedexperience appears in this report. In his trilogy, Wesselman gives accounts of adozen similar, richly detailed experiences without any previous psychedelicpractice. Interestingly, when I contacted him, he had no awareness of thepossibility of spontaneous DMT experiences being the inspiring force behind hismarvelous writing. image [images/00037.jpg] image [images/00038.jpg] image [images/00039.jpg] image [images/00040.jpg] image [images/00041.jpg] image [images/00042.jpg] image [images/00043.jpg] image [images/00044.jpg] image [images/00045.jpg] image [images/00046.jpg] Experiences related to the release of endogenous DMT are more universal than wemight suppose, and it is certain that they occurred in ancient times. Listenersof Art Bell’s or George Noory’s radio shows on Coast to Coast AM may notice thatmany UFO reports and near-death experiences carry the characteristic stamps of aspontaneous DMT release (for example, the interview with Steven Greer entitled“ET Contact and Disclosure,” which aired on June 1, 2006). Perhaps we can imagine the scene of a small Sumerian settlement about sixthousand years ago. What if some people imagined such a site and then reportedtheir hyperrealistic experiences after having spontaneous (or augmented—perhapsby Peganum harmala; see figure 9.4 on page 250) DMT release? Is it possible thatDMT is the source of some creation myths, and that its effects can explain somepeculiar characteristics of ancient legends: Anunnaki coming from outer space,modifying humans, inseminating women, and transferring significant information?Here are some other possible consequences. NACHASH ILLUMINATUS The word nachash, most often translated as “serpent,” appears in the HebrewBible in the scene explaining the origins of Original Sin. The meaning of thisHebrew word is much richer and can be illuminated in light of the DMT experience(see figure 9.3 on page 250). Michael Heiser points to the triple meaning ofnachash, which can be translated as “serpent” (noun), as “shiny” (adjective), oras “to deceive” or “to divine” (verb).17 [index_split_017.html#filepos870458] Aswe have seen, any of these meanings can take form or be built into a DMTexperience. If a strong believer in mind-expanding substances has any doubtabout the deceitfulness of a DMT experience, he or she must remember that notall hallucinations are true (some will even argue that by definition, nohallucination can be true). It’s best to refer to the expert opinion of Harner’sblind Conibo shaman: Only the worthy receives the truth. image [images/00047.jpg] ANGELOGENESIS As is shown by the ancient depiction of the Sumerian Anunnaki and the myths ofmany other cultures, smart and winged reptile beings were the first to descendon Earth. Figure 9.4 illustrates what may happen when Mesopotamian artists fromconsecutive generations, removed by centuries or even millennia from theoriginal visionary experience, copy winged beings over and over again. image [images/00048.jpg] INVASION FROM INNER SPACE It is estimated that in the observable universe (that is, the perimeter of thewhole universe from those places where light could reach us since the time ofthe Big Bang), there are as many as two hundred billion galaxies—each one withhundreds of billions of stars. The actual number of galaxies (and stars withpotentially life-bearing planets) is even larger, because the size of thevisible universe is but a tiny portion of the universe as a whole, theMetagalaxy, which started to expand with the Big Bang. Based on currentcalculations,18 [index_split_017.html#filepos870839] the ratio of the actualsize of the universe to the observable size is equal to the ratio between thesize of the observable universe and the size of a proton. That means that wemust multiply the number of visible galaxies by the huge difference between thesize of the observable universe and the proton. This unimaginable number ofgalaxies grows even more mind-boggling if we take into account the multiverse(as opposed to universe) theory, because contemporary physic’s string theory(more recently M-theory), bubble universe theory, and the many-worldsinterpretation of quantum mechanics posit the existence of parallel universes. We may argue that parallel universes can have different physical constants thanour universe—therefore they cannot permit the development of life. Based on theconcepts of the eminent string theorist Michio Kaku, however, this might notnecessarily be the case because of the presence of Darwinian-like evolutionaryprocesses that affect parallel universes.19 [index_split_017.html#filepos871101]Yes, natural selection may work in different universes! The physical constantsof our universe predispose it to the presence of both a vast number of blackholes and intelligent life. The singularity of a black hole may generate a BigBang in a parallel universe on the “other side.” The physical constants of thatbaby universe are very close to the constants of the mother universe. In thisway, we can see how a universe of our kind can propagate itself, while universeswith shorter life spans and a smaller number of black holes have less of achance to multiply. image [images/00003.jpg] The number of possible intelligent life-forms is likely to be incredibly high inthe multiverse model. How, then, might intelligent beings from the vastness ofthe multiverse reach out to each other and communicate among themselves?Definitely not by rocketships and radio waves, which traverse our local universeat a snail’s pace during the span of a human life. There is no need for suchmethods if the nonlocal feature of the universe (multiverse) permits contacts ofa different kind. As we have seen, these types of encounters may occur insteadin inner space and manifest as a transdimensional contact. Is there any difference between a transdimensional emergence and an intrapsychicone? Probably not—as we already discussed with regard to work by Jim DeKorne inthe introduction.20 [index_split_017.html#filepos871371] Higher dimensionalbeings can perceive lower dimensions more easily than lower ones can perceivehigher dimensions. For the latter, sensory organs (developed for coping in athree-dimensional space) are not suitable for perceiving entities emerging fromhigher dimensions. What follows that those from the nonlocal, topological fieldappear inextricably linked with our inner psychic processes, because theinterface for nonlocal processes—the quantum array antenna of the brain holdingthe quantum hologram of the Multiverse—is below the neuroaxonal level.Therefore, high dimensional outer space gets intrapsychically projected andpresents in inner space. Ancient gods such as the Anunnaki and the ghosts of ‘Ain Ghazal probably did notdescend from the skies, but instead ascended from inner depths, through thereceptive capacity of the human soul, which is anchored to a source in commonwith that of outer space. (We can remember the wisdom of Atman and Brahman.) Thegods were likely real beings, but were based on the duality of reality detailedthroughout this book—they were, and are, entities of the spiritual–nonlocalrealm instead of being sheer products of imagination. The concept of theirspiritual existence is not in conflict with their physical reality. IstvanDienes, an unorthodox physicist and a follower of the topological theory ofconsciousness, recently said of such beings: “They are autonomous structuresexisting in the topological field!” Ancient people considered them gods becausethey brought from nonlocal sources knowledge that was unimaginable to the commonpublic. Information that led to the development of human civilization wasreceived as a divine encounter via that common source, the dynamic ground, andDMT—the spirit molecule—might have been a key that opened the doors to thatspiritual source. What this chapter represents is my attempt, as an amateur scholar who comes fromthe field of psychopharmacology, to draw upon both archaeology and the historyof religion and provide a fresh perspective to these phenomena by offering somecontroversial proposals based upon my own expertise. Perhaps we can unite UFOobservations and a serious assessment of ancient and biblical studies.Interestingly, there is a striking coherence between what some people (in fact,a very significant portion of the population) have experienced and what has beenrecorded as divine encounters in ancient texts. In this chapter, nonordinaryreality has been attached to both of these types of experience without fullydisregarding their physical reality. By keeping a balance between sacred(spiritual) and profane (rational), we can convey a reassuring message tofaithful Jews, Christians, and Muslims who have been caught in a conflictbetween their religious faith and rational thinking: Holy revelations were notthe sheer product of imagination, and the great prophets truly tapped in to aholy, very meaningful source. Indeed, the encounters on Mount Sinai and thoseduring Al-Isra truly occurred. The concept of their spiritual existence does notdeny their physical reality. Using different terminology, Rabbi Joel David Bakst arrives at a similarconclusion: “[F]undamentally bney elohim (sons of God) are not angels and thebnot adam (daughters of man) are not earthly women. They are forces andprocesses that are part of the divine ‘physiology’ of creation dealingspecifically with primordial realities and their interface with the currentreality.”21 [index_split_017.html#filepos871608] DMT, the endogenous human hallucinogen (though here the termentheogen—manifesting the divine within—would be more appropriate), may be oneof the key components holding together this mix, because it provides clues tothe most cohesive, coherent understanding of the phenomena. Shockingly, thisendogenous compound offers coherence and conceptual validation of divineencounters and related spiritual experiences. Accepting the role of DMT indivine encounters or in holy revelations does not debunk scripture—understandingits role is not a sacrilege if we accept that DMT can be a key (among manyothers) to the spiritual realm. Perhaps our knowledge of reality must be altered to reflect a rationalexplanation of spiritual revelations. Divine encounters, while real to those whoexperience them, probably reflect a much more sophisticated model of realitythan scientific empiricism currently allows. In other words, divine encountersare likely not real in the traditional sense of flesh-and-blood or siliconextraterrestrial visitors interfering with human affairs. Here we may concludethat humans had indeed come into contact with a spiritual intelligence thatappears to antedate space–time as we know it—and gods are less extraterrestrialthan nonlocal. They emerge intrapsychically in the form of spiritual experiencethrough nonlocal, extradimensional connections within the multiverse.

A few years ago, the American public was shocked by the controversial reportfrom a respected psychiatrist from Harvard that claimed that under hypnosis,some of his patients recalled being abducted by alien beings. John Mack almostlost his job after publication of his book, Abduction,1[index_split_017.html#filepos872042] which tackled this topic. The excitementaround this subject matter gradually diminished even though thousands of otherpeople came up with similar accounts and several additional books on similartopics have been published by Mack and others.2,[index_split_017.html#filepos872260]3, [index_split_017.html#filepos872432]4[index_split_017.html#filepos872643] Some people studying this phenomenonestimate that more than five million Americans have experienced alien abduction,but there is no way to corroborate these stories, and it remains anuncomfortable subject to deal with for the majority of people. In March 2007,France became the first country to open its files on UFOs, unveiling a website(www.cnes-geipan.fr [http://www.cnes-geipan.fr]) that documented more thansixteen hundred sightings spanning five decades. Of these, nearly 25 percent areclassified as Type D, meaning that despite good or very good data and crediblewitnesses, these cases cannot be explained. Other countries also collect dataabout unidentified flying objects (UFOs), notably Britain and the United States,where information can be requested on a case-by-case basis under the Freedom ofInformation Act. Mack suggests in his book that aliens have come here to do more or less whatshamans do: to try to open our minds and to awaken us. In his view, the alienshad imbued many abductees specifically with a sense of profound, transpersonallove, as well as with a powerful desire to work for the betterment of ourendangered environment. He goes as far as to say that “[t]he alien encounterexperience seems almost like an outreach program from the cosmos to thespiritually impaired.” His research suggests that several alien species areexperimenting on us independently. It appears that we are dragging down thewhole universe by being selfish, self-centered, unloving, close-minded, anddense. In this sense, we are very important—the awakening of humanity will makethe universe a much nicer place in which to live for all sentient beings. Mackspeculates that the critical mass required to start the chain reaction to awakeneveryone is less than 5 percent of Earth’s population. Yet some other abductionresearchers, including Budd Hopkins, question his conclusions, pointing out thatabduction experiences have been very traumatic for most abductees and that it isdifficult to claim any benefits resulting from these experiences. Rock and cave paintings found in many locations around the world imply thatmodern humans don’t have a monopoly on encounters with alien beings andrealities. In Supernatural, Graham Hancock describes prehistoric paintings thatdepict a wide variety of seemingly alien beings who might have been the ancientteachers of humanity. Some of these rock paintings are reminiscent of certainalien species encountered by modern psychonauts and abductees—so-called Grays,or mantislike aliens.5 [index_split_017.html#filepos872880] The figure hereshows examples of other apparently alien beings depicted on rocks and cave wallsby our ancestors (see figures 10.1–10.4). image [images/00049.jpg] Sacred ancient Hindu writings known as Vedas and dating to 3000–2000 BCEdescribe encounters with aliens or gods who used various machines, weapons, andvehicles called vimanas that were able to fly in the air and under water andcould travel into space.6 [index_split_017.html#filepos873127] The Mahabharatadescribes conflicts between gods in which they used weapons as lethal as thosewe have now.7 [index_split_017.html#filepos873384] Apart from “blazingmissiles,” the poem records the use of other deadly weapons, such as Indra’sDart (Indravajrā), operated via a circular “reflector.” When switched on, itproduced a “shaft of light” that, when focused on any target, immediately“consumed it with its power.” In one exchange, the hero, Krishna, is pursuing his enemy Salva in the sky whenSalva’s vimana, the Saubha, is made invisible in some way. Undeterred, Krishnafires off a special weapon: “I quickly laid on an arrow, which killed by seekingout sound.” Many other terrible weapons are described quite matter-of-factly inthe Mahabharata, but the most fearsome of all is the one used against theVrishis: > Gurkha flying in his swift and powerful Vimana hurled against the three cities> of the Vrishis and Andhakas a single projectile charged with all the power of> the Universe. An incandescent column of smoke and fire, as brilliant as ten> thousands suns, rose in its entire splendor. It was the unknown weapon, the> Iron Thunderbolt, a gigantic messenger of death which reduced to ashes the> entire race of the Vrishnis and Andhakas. It is not clear whether these encounters occurred in consensus reality or underthe influence of hallucinogens (a distinction that would have been very alien toour ancestors!), including the mysterious substance known as Soma, or perhaps asa result of various spiritual practices, such as meditation and yoga. Similarly,in Genesis 6:4, the Hebrew scriptures describe human encounters with alienbeings who were the Sons of God: “The Nephilim were on the earth in thosedays—and also afterward—when the sons of God went to the daughters of men andhad children by them.” Also, in the Book of Ezekiel (1:4–24), a spaceshiplikevehicle is described with technical details as it is seen through the eyes of apre–Industrial Age man: > I looked, and I saw a windstorm coming out of the north—an immense cloud with> flashing lightning and surrounded by brilliant light. The center of the fire> looked like glowing metal, and in the fire was what looked like four living> creatures. In appearance their form was that of a man, but each of them had> four faces and four wings. Their legs were straight; their feet were like> those of a calf and gleamed like burnished bronze. Under their wings on their> four sides they had the hands of a man. All four of them had faces and wings,> and their wings touched one another. Each one went straight ahead; they did> not turn as they moved. . . . > As I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside each> creature with its four faces. This was the appearance and structure of the> wheels: They sparkled like chrysolite, and all four looked alike. Each> appeared to be made like a wheel intersecting a wheel. As they moved, they> would go in any one of the four directions the creatures faced; the wheels did> not turn about as the creatures went. Their rims were high and awesome, and> all four rims were full of eyes all around. > When the living creatures moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the> living creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose. Wherever the> spirit would go, they would go, and the wheels would rise along with them,> because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. . . . > Spread out above the heads of the living creatures was what looked like an> expanse, sparkling like ice, and awesome. Under the expanse their wings were> stretched out one toward the other, and each had two wings covering its body.> When the creatures moved, I heard the sound of their wings, like the roar of> rushing waters, like the voice of the Almighty, like the tumult of an army.> When they stood still, they lowered their wings. This description was detailed enough for some engineers to file a patent for awheel that can move in any direction and to create technical drawings depictinghow the spaceship may have looked like. We have already discovered the striking similarity between experiences ofabductees and volunteers infused with DMT in Rick Strassman’s study. It turnsout that hypnosis may also bring out other types of science-fiction-likememories. Obviously, we can wonder how much impact the hypnotist has on theexperience: Presumably, psychedelic experiences reflect the subject’s ownemotional-cognitive condition, while experiences induced by hypnosis may beaffected by external factors, such as an experimenter’s bias. Brian Weiss is a well-known and respected psychiatrist and a graduate ofColumbia University and Yale University who is currently the chairman emeritusof psychiatry at the Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami, Florida. Dr. Weiss hasbeen using hypnosis as a therapeutic tool to accelerate progress in thepsychotherapy of patients with a variety of problems. He became an experthypnotherapist, and was very successful in taking patients back to earlychildhood, where many of their current problems originated. In his book ManyLives, Many Masters,8 [index_split_017.html#filepos873602] he describes how, inthe early 1980s, he began working with a female patient who was very susceptibleto hypnosis. At first, however, he did not have much luck in identifying thetraumas that were responsible for symptoms that brought her to therapy. She wasable to regress to very early childhood, but did not appear to remember anythingdisturbing that could have caused her present neuroses. Dr. Weiss was at loss asto what to do, so he told her to go to the point in time when her problemsstarted. To his shock and amazement, she reported that she was now a seventeen-year-oldboy, drowning in the ocean. She was experiencing that death in terrifyingdetail, and he had to bring her out of the hypnosis quickly. He did not believein reincarnation and did not know what to make of her experience, yet some ofher symptoms improved, so he decided to continue therapy. During subsequenthypnotherapy sessions, his patient traveled to different periods in history, anddescribed her surroundings and her past lives in vivid detail. Dr. Weiss wasgrowing more and more incredulous, but his patient kept getting better, so thetherapy continued. Then, something even more unusual happened: during one of thesessions, she reported being in a time period between incarnations. Her voicechanged, and she told him about events from his personal life that she couldn’thave possibly known (such as the death of his two-month-old son due to a cardiacdefect several years before, an event that preceded his move to Florida). Dr.Weiss was no longer skeptical; this information convinced him finally that whathe heard from the patient was real, that her stories were not just products ofher imagination. He described the work he was doing as past life regression. He started using this technique in the therapy of other patients, and heaccumulated a wealth of stories from the patients he treated over twenty years.Finally, he gathered his courage and decided to publish a book describing hisfindings—despite concerns about the potential negative impact on his academiccareer. Today, he has published several books on the subject and conductsworkshops for psychotherapists, psychiatrists, and other clinical professionals,teaching them how to use past life regression therapy in their practice. Scoresof his patients have regressed easily to various historical periods. Somepatients report memories from Atlantis, and one patient saw flying vehiclespowered by “pure energy” cruising over sleek, glass skyscrapers. The patientdescribed them as looking more like cars than planes. His job was to change hislevel of consciousness to manipulate energy and transform matter to gainpersonal power. He and his peers used this power successfully to controlsurrounding civilizations. In the process, they almost destroyed the planet. Some patients returned to the Stone Age or to even earlier periods inprehistory. One patient reported traveling back in time sixty thousand years: hewas an alien being who recently migrated to Earth because his home planet wasdying. His body was similar to the human body, and members of his species livedamong humans. His job was to store artifacts and written knowledge of hiscivilization in natural caverns deep under Earth’s surface. “By the time humanshave reached a level where they can understand what was hidden, they will beable to find it,” he told Dr. Weiss. More recently, Dr. Weiss has tried to take patients into both the near and thedistant future. He is careful to acknowledge that the future seems to be a“flexible” destination—a multitude of possible and probable futures may lieahead of us. Many people believe that we have free will and if this is the case,the future course of human history is not predetermined, but instead depends onour present actions. He describes experiments in which he hypnotizes audiencesparticipating in his workshops (often hundreds of people at the time) and asksthem to go into the future one hundred, two hundred, five hundred, or moreyears. Afterward, he asks audience members to write down what they saw (withoutcomparing notes with others), and then he compiles the results. In his recentbook Same Soul, Many Bodies, Dr. Weiss describes what he has learned so far.9[index_split_017.html#filepos873794] Interestingly, the majority of these accounts appear to describe a ratherconsistent picture of how our world may look one day. According to him, in oneto two hundred years, the world will be largely the same as it is now. Therewill be natural and man-made calamities, but not on a global level. After threeto six hundred years, a second Dark Age will begin. The next few hundred yearsafter this appear to be very stormy and dark, but ultimately things get muchbetter. A thousand or more years into the future, we will inhabit an idyllic,fertile, peaceful land. Some of the areas of the world, such as the Middle Eastand North Africa, will be off-limits (perhaps because of radiation damage orepidemic), but the rest of the world will be beautiful. Fewer people willinhabit Earth, and these inhabitants have been described as content, happy, evenblissful. They can access all knowledge and are omnipotent, they can come intoand leave their bodies at will, there is no disease, and even death isn’t whatit seems today. In short: heaven on Earth—the way our life was always meant tobe. Brian Weiss also describes how some of his patients are able to detach fromtheir bodies and float above them during meditation or experience their past orfuture lives. Some people who practice meditation report experiences that couldbe called paranormal or mystical. In addition to out-of-body travel, these maycomprise time travel and contact with alien entities. While I was meditating asa medical student several years ago, I also experienced an encounter of thistype. I was lying on the bed in my bedroom, doing a certain type of a breathingexercise, when I felt a vibration in my extremities, and then my hearing beganexpanding like a sphere. First, I heard my sister scribbling something in theroom next door, then my hearing shifted to focus on water dripping slowly fromthe tap in the kitchen downstairs, then to a street car screeching on its tracksseveral blocks away. Finally, I heard the waves of the sea lapping on the beachmiles away, as if I was right there. Simultaneously, I noticed that my body feltlike an empty shell, and I started shrinking within that shell, becoming smallerand smaller. At some point, I sensed another presence near me. I perceived it asdark and hostile, and it appeared intent on destroying me. I panicked and triedto get up, but I couldn’t—I was paralyzed. I struggled and I managed finally tosit up, drenched in sweat and scared to death (as if I was experiencing “old hagsyndrome”). image [images/00050.jpg] As you can imagine, I abandoned this type of meditation for a long time—thoughit turns out that this may have been a mistake. The dark figure I experiencedwas likely either my shadow—the part of our personality that we reject and tendto project onto others around us—or a Threshold Guardian, an entity oftendescribed by Native American shamans that guards the entrance to spiritualrealms. Such shadow figures have been discovered in some ancient rock paintingsfrom a variety of places around the world (see figure 10.2). Facing the shadowallows us to overcome fear and thus radically advance on the spiritual path. Hank Wesselman, a contemporary American anthropologist, describes very similarexperiences in his book Spiritwalker: Messages from the Future.10[index_split_017.html#filepos873995] He didn’t panic as I did when strangeeffects began occurring. His courage paid off and allowed him amazingexperiences. A gateway was opened in his mind, and in due course this led himinto a distant future—a time more than five thousand years from now. A fewmonths after his initial episode, he underwent a classical out-of-bodyexperience: first, he wandered around his house while his body was still lyingon the bed, and then he was lifted into space and traveled to a number of otherplanets—some lunarlike with ashy gray plains and deserts and others full ofalien plants and animals. One of the planets had two suns in the sky, whichproduced interesting double shadows of slightly different hues. After theseexperiences, he was suddenly back on his bed. Subsequently, he experienced a series of events that involved merging with ayoung man named Nainoa. As Wesselman’s fascinating story unfolds, we trek withNainoa through the jungles of future America and meet our remote descendants.The author deduces that the American continent is being recolonized by settlersfrom Hawaii. He describes people living in Stone Age–like conditions, andspeculates that our current technological civilization has been wiped out bycatastrophic rises in ocean levels—thirty to fifty feet a year, with a totalrise of three hundred to five hundred feet over several years, which hasdestroyed ports and cut off the oil supplies on which our society depends. Inhis vision, there isn’t much left after the collapse of current civilization,and it appears that there is no hope for people ever to reclaim technologicaladvances that we enjoy today. In his future time, there is hardly any metal leftfor the production of tools. It seems as though this particular future is not necessarily compatible with theone seen by participants of Brian Weiss’s workshops. Can these differences beexplained by the personal bias of those who experience it and their assumptionsand fantasies about the future of humanity? Some argue that only minor portionsof these “revelations” have supernatural origins; most of them can be easilyexplained by taking into account the personal background and the knowledge baseof each visionary. Another explanation, already mentioned, is that there aremultiple possible futures; the future course of our history will be determinedby our actions today. In his book The Disappearance of the Universe, Gary Renard describes how, afterseveral years of diligently practicing meditation, he finally reached a stagewhen he could completely empty his mind. When he opened his eyes after one ofhis meditation sessions, he saw two strangers on the couch in his room. To hisamazement, they claimed to have arrived from the future. Sounds like a classicalscience-fiction story, right? These guests continued to visit Renard’s houseperiodically, teaching him about spirituality, relationships, and God. He claimsthat he experienced teleportation and even traveled into the near future withthem. As you might imagine, Renard could not resist asking them some questionsabout the past and the future—and as you might expect, they were not tooforthcoming with the details, but they were willing to give to him someinteresting tidbits of information.11 [index_split_017.html#filepos874189] Inhis second book, Your Immortal Reality, Renard learns that humans did not evolveon Earth, but instead migrated from a distant planet in another solarsystem—first to Mars and then to Earth.12 [index_split_017.html#filepos874410]That seems to corroborate the story conveyed by one of Brian Weiss’s patients.The strangers confirmed for Renard that an alien spaceship indeed crashed inRoswell, and in addition, they told him that there are several humanoid alienspecies in the universe that have DNA very similar to ours. image [images/00051.jpg] Renard asked the strangers what is going to happen in 2012, because some peoplebelieve that the world will end on December 21, 2012 (when the Mayan calendarends). The strangers said that this time would be simply an end of one cycle anda start of another one, rather than the end of the world. They told him alsothat global warming would be turned around eventually, though it would producesome very extreme weather in the meantime. They told him that the average lifespan would reach one hundred years by the end of this century, and that theworld is going to undergo the biggest economic expansion in human history, withthe Dow Jones Industrial average reaching 100,000 by the middle of the century(though growth will be even bigger in Europe). The strangers also told him aboutquantum computers that would boggle the mind, space elevators, tourist trips tothe moon, and teleportation—just like in Star Trek, only even better, becauseteleportation will become the prevailing mode of space travel beyond the nextcentury. Incidentally, in October 2006, the journal Science reported thatphysicists in Denmark succeeded in teleporting a macroscopic atomic objectcontaining billions of atoms a distance of half a meter. The website of theDanish National Research Foundation Center for Quantum Optics(http://quantop.nbi.dk [http://quantop.nbi.dk]) includes updates on the progressof their research. A quantum physicist has recently told me that an effort isunder way to teleport viruses. Renard’s friends from the future also warned about the new leader of Iran, who,according to them, is an insane extremist who should not be fooled with ordismissed lightly. They claimed that he is the man whom Nostradamus described asthe biggest threat to the cities of the West. They told him that this man willbe involved in some capacity in setting off a nuclear device in one or more bigcities such as Tel Aviv, London, New York, and Los Angeles. Finally, it is worth mentioning that certain breathing techniques, such asrebirthing13 [index_split_017.html#filepos874610] (also known as yoga breathing)and its modernized version, known as holotropic breathing, may lead to some ofthe experiences described in this book. During these breathing sessions, eachperson lies on a mat with eyes closed and uses his or her own breath to enter anonordinary state of consciousness. Holotropic breathing combines acceleratedbreathing with evocative music and bodywork, such as massage, deep-tissuemanipulation, and energy balancing. Many people with spontaneous experiences such as those described here don’tspeak about them for fear of being ostracized or labeled “mentally ill.” It isnot clear how common such experiences are in the general population, but theycan be induced relatively easily by “spiritual technologies” described here. image [images/00052.jpg] We may wonder what, if any, is the purpose of these experiences. Are they simplymind candy to be pursued for the sake of entertainment—or do they have a deeperpurpose? In fact, all of these techniques may produce experiences that play animportant role in healing our minds and bodies and aiding our spiritualdevelopment. In his recent book Communion with God, Neale Donald Walsch tells us that all ofthe wondrous abilities of future humans can be realized today by individuals whoare determined enough to do the work necessary to awaken.14[index_split_017.html#filepos874836] Awakening means freedom—freedom fromanything that may bind us: suffering, boredom, imprisonment in the body in timeor on the planet. We are limited only by our imagination. Native Americanshamans and Indian gurus such as Swami Prabhupada, who wrote a book entitledEasy Journey to Other Planets,15 [index_split_017.html#filepos875032] claim tohave an ability to visit other worlds. Perhaps it is truly possible for us totake a tour of the universe without waiting for technology to catch up with ourdreams. "},{"pageContent":"image [images/00004.jpg] 11image [images/00004.jpg] Preparation for the Journey Rick Strassman, M.D. Important disclaimer: None of the authors of this book condones any illegalactivities, even when it comes to the potentially beneficial effects of alteringconsciousness with a psychedelic drug. In nearly the entire world, it is illegalto possess major psychedelics such as mescaline, DMT, LSD, and psilocybin. Insome instances, the plants that contain these chemicals, such asmescaline-containing peyote cactus and psilocybin-containing magic mushrooms,are also banned. While a discussion of the current laws regarding these plants and chemicals isbeyond the scope of this book, we believe in the maxim “The law of the land isthe law.” Therefore, the authors take no responsibility—legal, medical,psychological, spiritual, or otherwise—for any difficulty in which anyone mayfind him-or herself as a result of manufacturing, possessing, distributing, orusing a psychedelic substance. Nevertheless, the human drive to profoundly alter consciousness in the way thatpsychedelics do so reliably cannot be extinguished. Whereas there clearly areother legal ways in which we may alter our consciousness—meditation, prayer,fasting, extreme sports, and so on—few of us are able to attain a trulypsychedelic state without using drugs or plants. Thus, some may consider thelegal and other risks associated with taking psychedelic substances as lesscompelling than their perceived benefits. Whenever possible, we advise using such materials in licit circumstances. Thereare countries and contexts in which the use of certain psychedelic substances islegal. Examples include ayahuasca-using churches in the West, centers in LatinAmerica that use ayahuasca and other psychoactive plants, and peyote-usingchurches in North America, where jurisdictions allow its use for both Nativesand non-Natives. image [images/00003.jpg] Those preparing for a psychedelic drug experience, even the most seasonedveterans, nearly always feel intense anticipation. The late Secret Chief, a SanFrancisco Bay–area psychologist who supervised thousands, if not tens ofthousands, of psychedelic drug sessions, referred to this feeling ofanticipation of a session as “[t]he trip has already begun.” The Secret Chief was uncannily, unerringly, and extraordinarily accurate—and itmay require some deep thinking to fully understand what he meant. Obviously, themere act of thinking about, discussing, and deciding to undergo a psychedelicdrug session is not the same as actually taking a drug. Nevertheless, by makingsuch a decision, we initiate a cascade of events within the matrix of set andsetting, which form a continuum not only limited to the discrete time periodduring which we are under the influence of a psychedelic, but also spreading inall directions, like the proverbial pebble thrown into the pond. By embarking onthe preliminary stages of taking such a trip, we set in motion certain feelings,thoughts, and actions that lead to a potentially life-changing event. Our liveshave already come under the influence of the trip. Set and setting, the two primary factors involved in determining the outcome ofthe inner journey to outer space, are themselves modifiable via the two primarytasks of that journey: getting ready and letting go. GETTING READY In order to derive the most benefit from making any journey, inner or outer, wemust do what we can to minimize the risks of a negative outcome and optimize thechances for a positive one. Once we have established the most solid foundationpossible, we can be more assured of the beneficial outcome that may result fromtruly letting go. We possess the power to determine the nature and course of our trip much as wepossess the power to determine the nature and course of our lives. On the onehand, our lives are undeniably constrained by the circumstances of our birth:our genetic make-up; who our parents are; and the chemical, social, andpsychological environment into which we were born. In addition, we are subjectto the “accidents” continuously coming our way: those chance encounters thatplay such an important role in who we are and what we do. On the other hand, wealso have the choice of how to regard and react to these circumstances. This maybe what is meant by the maxim “Everything is in the hand of heaven except theawe of heaven.” At the same time, we must not forget that the ultimate purpose and context ofour lives is vast and ultimately unknowable. In this case, we can refer to thecomplementary maxim “The work is never done, but we must never cease from doingit.” We must do everything we can to develop our intention and attitude towardwhat awaits us in the psychedelic state. Then, when we meet what awaits us, wecan allow it to show us what it will and take us where it will. There are several practical considerations in getting ready for a session. Wecan parse these into a general temporal scheme: long-term work, intermediatework, and short-term work. Long-term WorkIf we know ourselves—our state and traits—as best as possible, we will be ableto contend with any likely resistance to the letting go that is requisite forthe optimal journey. This self-knowledge cannot be acquired quickly, but ratherrequires years and decades. Nevertheless, at some point, anyone who will makethis journey must begin walking the path to inner knowledge. The two most common ways of increasing self-knowledge and learning how we relateto ourselves and others—those enduring and deep-seated elements of our set—arepsychotherapy and spiritual practice. Although some consider the two atcross-purposes, they may be combined in very useful ways, because they exhibitcommon elements in theory, technique, and goals. Both use focused self-awarenessto observe, understand, accept, and modify our feelings, thoughts, and behaviorsin order that we may live more fulfilling, satisfying lives. Whereas meditationmay emphasize awareness of mental, cognitive, and perceptual processes, Westernpsychotherapy usually relates to working with emotional concerns. Spiritual or religious practice may be shorn of much of its theological contentand rituals by emphasizing primarily its benefits in the development ofself-awareness and the cultivation of desired mental states. For example,sustained concentration on our body and mind in a regular meditation practicecan help make apparent several core issues: How do we experience anxiety—in ourbodies or mentally? If we perceive anxiety in both the body and mind, whichperception comes first? What of vulnerability, happiness, and fear? What are ourfears? Is it our nature to share with others or keep to ourselves? Prayer, perhaps in a way we usually don’t consider, also may provide access tohelpful discoveries. Praying to an outside source of help or wisdom may resultin many of the same answers regarding who we are and how we function in theworld—answers similar to those that might arise in a meditation practice. Wherewe acquire such information may not matter fundamentally within the context ofsimply obtaining increased self-knowledge and efficacy. In addition, regularmeditation or prayer practice does much to develop our muscles of attention, andwe can then apply our strengthened ability to focus toward examining ourselvesin ways we may not have been capable of engaging previously. A reliable, dependable, empathetic, and admirable teacher can be of great helpin this process. He or she can provide instruction and encouragement and serveas a role model who encourages us to persist in our practice. In addition tothese more formal teaching functions, an effective meditation or prayer teacherallows for the development of a close relationship between him-or herself andstudents. An open-eyed examination of the nature of this relationship—its upsand downs, misinterpretations, and projections—can be invaluable to our processof discovering who we really are. Effective psychotherapy shares features with an effective meditation or prayerpractice. These include paying attention to areas of difficulty in our lives. Bylooking carefully at what situations stir up particular emotions, thoughts, andbehaviors, we may discover previously unacknowledged emotional and cognitivehabits that served us at one time but no longer do so. Within the traditionalpsychotherapeutic setting, we find the relationship that develops betweenstudent and therapist more commonly subject to careful examination. Thisanalysis of the transference is especially the case within the psychoanalyticframework. If our meditation or prayer practice is focused on more than self-examinationand self-improvement, it will begin forcing us to ask larger questions thatalmost certainly will arise in any deep psychedelic work. These questionsconcern the existence, nature, and providence of God; the reason for our birth;the nature of this reality; enlightenment; and how to contend with nonphysicalrealities and encounters with alien or spiritual or noncorporeal beings. Thedeeper mystical teachings of the religions from which these meditation or prayerpractices emerge are well equipped to provide answers to these questions. We maythus find ourselves pursuing a deeper involvement in a particular religion. Conversely, the typical psychotherapeutic endeavor is not as concerned withspiritual issues—though any good psychotherapist knows the limits of his or herskill and will make a timely and appropriate referral to a spiritual teacherwhen necessary. In the same manner, a competent spiritual teacher will recognizethe need for a psychotherapy referral when mood, thought, or personality issuesappear to be interfering with progress in a meditation or prayer practice. Intermediate WorkOnce we have decided to take a psychedelic journey, we can start preparing inspecific ways. To the extent possible, we can educate ourselves regarding whatto expect on our trip. Having some sense of the expected terrain, as describedby those who have gone before, can be quite helpful. In this way, if others havealerted us to what to expect, we may not be surprised when we encounterphenomena far beyond the range of what is familiar to us. The literature regarding near-death and out-of-body experiences, meditation,abduction, shamanism, and, of course, the taking of psychedelic drugs contains awealth of information about others’ experiences. It can provide us with helpfulbackground information as well as practical means of dealing with those states.Also recommended is speaking with others who have gone before, listening totalks, and getting involved in online groups of the various communities thatdiscuss highly altered states of consciousness—and not only those concerned withthe effects of psychedelic drugs. Some might object on the grounds that these educational activities may bias ustoward particular expectations that can lead to certain specific types ofexperiences at the expense of others—yet these arguments are not especiallypersuasive. The truly psychedelic experience is totally unexpected.Nevertheless, knowing how unexpected it can be may help us to keep our bearingswhen confronted with it. We will be ready for the unexpected. Discuss the impending trip with your therapist or spiritual teacher if you haveone. However, it should not come as a surprise if the stigma attached to druguse causes spiritual teachers to discourage the taking of them. This may be thecase even if he or she has had personally beneficial experiences withpsychedelics. Faced with disapproval from someone in whom we have placed greatfaith and who has previously been very helpful to us, we may need to shelve thetopic of psychedelic use and continue our work with him or her without anycontinued interference caused by such a discussion. Or perhaps we may decide toseek instruction elsewhere, in a context in which we can discuss how psychedelicdrug experiences may work together with therapy or meditation or prayer. Those who are taking medication should make certain that there are no possibleadverse interactions with these medications and the psychedelic drugsconsidered. For those who are taking medications for conditions that can also bemanaged by lifestyle changes such as exercise; weight loss; diet adjustments;and the cessation of the use of alcohol, tobacco, caffeine, and other drugs, tryto follow through with these changes first to see if some of the medications mayno longer be necessary. The point is to simplify body chemistry as much aspossible. Though the reasons behind the desire to stop medications may remainprivate, the actual process of trying to discontinue them must be taken up withyour health care provider. IntentOnce we have decided we want to experience a psychedelic drug session, we musthome in on our intent. As the Secret Chief asked, “To what purpose?” Why are wedoing this and what do we hope to accomplish or gain from such an experience? Isit primarily curiosity that drives us—are we intellectually and emotionallydrawn to novelty, to something new, exotic, and exciting? Do we wish toexperience pleasure of an extraordinary degree? Do we have an emotional,artistic, creative, professional, spiritual, or interpersonal problem we want tosolve? Are we seeking a spiritual experience or answers to our deepestyearnings? Do we wish to know God—to see him or her face-to-face? Do we hope foran encounter with the angels or the powers through which God manifests? Are weinterested in outer-space travel, science-fiction revelations, journeys throughtime, and encounters with alien civilizations and their inhabitants? Do we wishto obtain information and power for good or for ill? Do we want to make theworld a better place—or do we intend to hurt those who have hurt us? Do we wishto suffer? Do we want to create a situation in which we replay abusive past orpresent relationships? There are so many possible motivations to take a trip—and any of these maycompete and blend with one another. We must be as honest as possible withourselves when deciding what our intentions are, realizing that having aparticular intention doesn’t necessarily guarantee the content of the session.We don’t always have the trip we want; instead, we seem to have the trip weneed. If we tell ourselves that our motivation is, perhaps, to learn more aboutour relationships, but, more honestly, we want to have a good time, we may beunpleasantly surprised when we’re actually confronted by deeper, more painfulpsychological issues. Conversely, we may approach the experience with deepsolemnity and expectations for a divine encounter and then be similarlyunprepared for the fun, light-hearted aspects of our session. Thus, it isimportant to understand the full range and complementary nature of ourmotivations. Ideally, this is accomplished through the use of the introspectiveskills we have obtained during our own inner work, either spiritual orpsychotherapeutic. It is worth noting that developing an intention to undergo a spiritual,otherworldly, near-death transcendent type of experience is, in some ways, thesame as making the decision to subvert the dominant Western postindustrialworldview. That is, the total loss of self-control and our usual self-identityand the wish to interact with and be guided by spiritual entities whose mercy wecount upon fly in the face of a materialistic, individualistic, and fear-basedrelationship to existence. It also runs contrary to a solely clergy-mediatedrelationship to the divine. If and when we do have this type of experience, wemust realize that the mainstream, using the tools of ridicule andpsychopathologizing, among others, will oppose our discussing and valuing it. Short-term WorkHow do we prepare ourselves in the day or two before the psychedelic journey?First, it is paramount that we understand our intentions. Then, by attending tocertain concrete matters, we validate our intention to mark this experience asunique. The essence of making something holy or sacred is to separate ordistinguish between the sacred and the profane. Though at the absolute level ofreality, there are no such differences between what is sacred and what isprofane, at the relative level, in which most of us exist most of the time, thetwo do differ. Thus, it is important to manifest our inner intent through ourphysical reality. We want to perceive as clearly as possible our psychedelicexperience without the muddying effects of influences such as fatigue and anunsafe environment. It’s important to approach the trip in good health and with a positive state ofmind and to be well rested and have a clean body and clean clothes. Participantsshould be careful with what they eat, drink, and smoke several days before thetrip. Further, are there loose ends requiring attention? Are these minor tasks,such as taking out the garbage, making a necessary phone call, and paying anoverdue bill, or are some more significant, such as updating a will? Thoughupdating a will may appear morbid, consider the prospect that while undergoing anear-death experience, you may recall that you have no will! Would youremotional reactions to your sense of dying be different if you knew you hadtaken care of those you were leaving behind? Before taking any psychedelics, it is recommended that you check in with thosewho are most important in your life. Are we on good terms with our partner,spouse, family, friends, and business associates? An extra prayer, meditationsession, or psychotherapy appointment or two in the days before a trip can makeclear some internal or external issues that might require special attention. SETTING Clearly perceiving our intent naturally leads us to decide upon the setting, thecircumstances in which we will be taking the trip. Earlier, we discovereddifferent categories of experiences resulting from psychedelic-drug ingestion.We can use these categories as a model for conceptualizing the types of tripsavailable to us: * A pleasurable trip that fulfills curiosity * A problem-solving session that addresses psychotherapeutic issues we want to work on or creative, professional, or other concerns * A spiritual, near-death experience or otherworldly journey Also to be considered are the particulars of the trip. These include: * Environment—outdoors or indoors * The dose of the drug * Whether we will journey alone or in a group * Whether we will have a sitter * Accoutrements for our trip such as music or art supplies * Supplemental techniques for reaching altered states of consciousness Finally, we must consider if the session will take place in a research setting.All types of trips can take place in a research environment; it is important,however, to note the constraints and opportunities unique to this type ofsetting—the most important of which concerns the issue of altruism, the notionof giving up something in our own trip for the benefit of others. Is the Setting Outdoors or Indoors?An outdoor setting of natural beauty can lead to profound levels ofidentification or merging with the natural world, yet being outdoors is alsoless predictable than being indoors. These unpredictable factors includeinsects, animals, inclement weather, unwelcome intrusions by other people, dirtof all kinds, and lack of facilities if participants fall ill or feelparticularly helpless. An outdoor setting in a city or suburb can provide a unique perspective onhumanity, but it lends itself more to an externally oriented and at timespotentially chaotic experience. Such a setting requires us to be prepared forexposure to a wide array of interpersonal and technical challenges. An indoorsetting in an area of natural beauty can combine the best of both worlds: thesafety and predictability of an indoor space and the option of going outside toexperience nature. DOSAGE, ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION, AND COMBINING DRUGS We can divide doses into low, intermediate, and high. Usually, the higher thedose of drug, the more intense and longer-lasting the effects. Yet there aremany cases in which the same person experiences a marked effect from a smalldose and seems less affected by a large dose at some other time. Instead ofserving as examples of tolerance, in which repeated dosing decreases subsequentresponses, or sensitization, in which low initial doses increase the effects ofsubsequent low doses, there seems to be some poorly understood interplay amongdose, set, and setting that results in dose not being invariably related tointensity and duration of effect. There is merit in beginning with a low dose of any substance that is new to us,whether that “substance” is a relationship, exercise routine, or a psychedelicdrug. As is true most of the time, however, the true nature of any particularrelationship is rarely known without receiving a full dose. Thus at some point,for the truly adventurous explorer of these realms, sooner or later a high doseplays a role in his or her work with the substance and the realms into which itleads. Another consideration is route of administration. There are various ways toadminister a drug. Intravenous injection, smoking, and snorting are the fastestways to experience effects. Slower onset occurs with routes such asintramuscular and subcutaneous (under the skin) injection. Slower yet aregastrointestinal methods, such as swallowing or rectal administration. Topicalapplication to the skin or mucous membranes varies in speed, depending upon theintegrity of the tissue—that is, effects occur more quickly from applying a drugto a wound or open sore than from applying it to intact, calloused skin. Inaddition, the “carrier” for the topically applied drug, the solvent into whichit is dissolved, can make a big difference in the speed of absorption. Forexample, DMSO (dimethylsufoxide) is a solvent that allows for very rapid skinabsorption of a drug, whereas cocoa butter is absorbed by the skin more slowly. It’s also best to choose one dose of one drug for a particular session and thenstick to that decision. Participants may feel the need to take more of asubstance if the effects are not as hoped for—what some refer to as taking a“booster” dose. While there are instances of this booster being an integral partof the experience—for example, in indigenous ayahuasca sessions—it is advisableto exercise caution in this area. Particularly when alone, impaired judgment maylead to making ill-advised decisions, and can lead to taking a dose that is toohigh. Remember, there is always the next time to take more. Neither is it advisable to mix substances. Doing so blurs the effect of one orthe other, and may produce toxic interactions. SOLO OR GROUP: THE ROLE OF STRUCTURE In this instance, the term structure refers to behavioral parameters that weimpose upon ourselves during a session. Such parameters are for our own safetyand comfort and optimization of the trip. Further, when we are in a groupsetting, establishing a structure is intended to respect others’ feelings andneeds. There are several options regarding how many people we decide to journeywith: We may travel solo, with a small group of friends or strangers, or with alarger group of friends or strangers. SoloSafety concerns suggest having a trusted individual or individuals in our spacewhen we take psychedelics, but sometimes none is available. In addition, we maywant to journey free from any interpersonal interference; we may not wantcompany. Nevertheless, it is relatively imprudent to embark solo on a firsttrip. Even after we’ve gained some familiarity with a particular drug, it’s wiseto let a confidant know of our plans and whereabouts when we take the drugagain. If we do take the journey alone, it is important to think through certain issuesbeforehand, and to decide upon responses to which we can adhere. It’s importantto gain familiarity with these structural issues from those who are moreexperienced with taking a drug, and that we spend some time establishingreasonable and appropriate guidelines for our session. Though we might hope tocommit these guidelines to memory, once the time comes, it is helpful to havethem available in written form in case we are unable to recall them. In mostcases, when we are under the influence, it is ill advised to change thestructure we have set up before taking the drug. It is important to rememberthat we can always change the guidelines for our next session, when we have hadsome time to think about these issues after we’ve had the experience of onejourney. There are many structural issues to consider, especially if we are taking thedrug alone. Will we be listening to music? If so, will we set up our play listbeforehand or decide what we will listen to when we are in an altered state ofconsciousness? Do we intend to keep our eyes open or closed? Would we likeeyeshades? Will we remain clothed? How much of the session will we spend lyingdown versus sitting up and walking around? When and what do we eat? How will wemake sure we drink enough fluids? Under what circumstances might we take more ofa drug or smoke a cigarette or drink alcohol or coffee? After our trip, when canwe drive or leave the immediate premises? What about answering the telephone ormaking calls? How do we get help if we need it? What do we do if things becomeunbearable—do we want to have a tranquilizer on hand to chemically abort thetrip? GroupWhenever more than one person in the room is under the influence, we must takeinto consideration other people’s set and setting issues; however, this mayquickly ferment into a frothy brew of personalities and interactions. Therefore,in group settings—particularly in a new group—it is important to have additionalelements of the structure decided and agreed upon in advance. One way tominimize stresses associated with a group session is for each person to have hisor her solo trip. The use of eyeshades and well-spaced, single-sized mattressesor pads will help effect well-demarcated, individual experiences in a groupsetting. As drug effects wear off, interactions might then begin outside themain room in order not to distract those who want to continue with a moreinner-directed experience. Yet the purpose of a group setting, particularly with lower and intermediatedoses, may be to engage in some group activity such as playing or listening tomusic, sharing an aesthetic experience, or problem solving. In cases such asthese, we might spend most of our time exploring how the group process isaffected by the influence of the psychedelic. Most important, however, is thatthese expectations and ground rules be discussed and agreed upon before asession begins. There are other concerns in a group: How do we signal that we are in need (thatis, do we raise our hand or speak)? How would we like to be supported? Issupport verbal or physical? How are decisions made regarding our welfare orbehavior? If some find the music, incense, or room temperature or lightingunpleasant, how will this be managed? In addition, will others in the group besober or intoxicated? If intoxicated, will everyone in the group be taking thesame drug? How will we know? Whereas certain variables lend themselves to more or less flexible responses,some structural issues are best adhered to rather strictly. For example,intercourse or sexual interactions of any kind between participants during thesession should be prohibited, as should physical, verbal, or emotional actingout of aggression. It is unwise to ask for or accept material favors such asmoney or property during the group session. Certainly, we may ask for and acceptfavors whose consequences do not extend beyond the session, such as a blanket ifwe are cold, a book for viewing, and the like. Asking for favors that requirefollow-through outside of the session, however, should wait until everyone isback to a normal state of consciousness. In addition, everyone must remain inthe group until previously agreed-upon criteria have been met—for example, thegroup leader has determined that drug effects are adequately resolved and, ifthere is no leader, everyone must get a good night’s sleep before leaving.Privacy and confidentiality are crucial in the success of any such group, and,therefore, everyone must agree never to mention with whom they took a group tripwithout the express permission of the others involved. One of the advantages of the group setting is the option of having a period oforganized sharing after the session, usually the day after the experience. Thiscan be quite helpful in terms of the crucial reentry and reintegration necessaryfor optimal use of the session. THE SITTER Along with the question of who else is in the room tripping with us, animportant question concerns whether anyone is “sitting” for those under theinfluence. The sitter supervises a psychedelic session much like a babysittersupervises children—those who take psychedelics may need the same kind ofsteering, restraining, and nurturing. In addition, it derives from thesimilarity between sitting in meditation and supervising a psychedelic session.The sitter must combine the skill of allowing people under his or her care to gothrough whatever takes place in a psychedelic trip and the skill of remainingalert and focused on the needs of those who are journeying. This combination ofalert passivity and passive activity is a hallmark of many meditation practices. Whether we are tripping on our own or in a group without a designated sitter,ostensibly there is a greater sense of freedom to have the type of trip wewant—yet, particularly with high-dose sessions, it may be easier to let go morecompletely if we feel someone is taking care of us. In addition, the relativeanarchy that may reign in a group setting, especially if people are on highdoses, can be difficult to orchestrate. One or more sitters can provide a muchneeded supervisory function in such a setting. Some sitters may lead sessions more actively, rather than simply responding tothe needs of participants. Those trained in a shamanic model may play musicalinstruments, sing, whistle, dance, shout, manipulate bodies physically andenergetically, and pour, rub, or spit various liquids, smokes, and powders ontoparticipants. Set of the SitterThough there are many reasons to trip with a sitter, it is important to beextraordinarily careful regarding under whose supervision we place ourselveswhen we are taking psychedelics. Such consideration both makes the most ofsessions and works to avoid problems. It’s useful to note that participants willbe deeply involved with this person at all stages of a trip—before, during, andafter. The sitter is in a position of authority, leadership, and support, andthose who will participate in a session are well advised to learn what they canabout that person. Some questions include: Is he or she religiously or spiritually oriented? Is heor she a member of any particular religion or profession? What is his or hertraining? What about sexual orientation? Is he or she married or does he or shehave children? Does a potential sitter drink alcohol or use drugs, and if so,does he or she use them excessively or in moderation? Is he or she vegetarian?What are his or her motivations for supervising sessions—money, a desire toheal, sadism, curiosity, altruism, voyeurism, career advancement? How does he orshe relate to the power and reputation that a sitter may accrue? What is his orher experience with these compounds in terms of administration to others as wellas regarding personal use? Is this someone of whom we can ask questions and withwhom we can work out plans for various situations that might arise during ourtrip? Do we feel we can trust this person to give us guidance and support whenwe are unable to provide these for ourselves? We strongly encourage asking prospective sitters any or all questions whoseanswers will affect participants’ feelings of safety and encouragement during asession. Included in these questions is a discussion of issues regardingstructure. In addition, because it is so difficult to obtain psychedelic drugs,the person who supervises a session may be the one from whom participants obtainthe drug. This is usually the case in small-group and shamanic sessions, and isalways true in the research environment. Is the Sitter Experienced?Within the shamanic tradition, it is axiomatic that the leader is intimately andthoroughly familiar with all manner of drugs and plants that he or she willadminister to others. This is also usually the case in the West with those whosit for underground users of psychedelics. Empathy— knowing what another isfeeling—is quite important in any healing or spiritual work, and is found mostoften when the healer has previously undergone a similar experience. Even if thesetting is not intended to address healing or spiritual issues directly, thesemay nevertheless arise at any time, and the sitter should be capable ofresponding appropriately. Within the academic setting in the United States, a sitter’s personal use of thepsychedelic in question is discouraged. This is one of the unfortunate resultsof the Harvard research group’s widely publicized personal use of psychedelicsin the 1960s. Yet western European researchers are required to “go first” in anyof their own psychedelic studies. There are several reasons for this: in orderto make sure drugs and doses are safe, these scientists believe it is moreethical to first self-administer an experimental treatment, especially if thereis no significant therapeutic benefit expected. By going first, they bear thebrunt of any adverse effects. In addition, European regulatory authoritiesbelieve that the informed consent process is better served if the researchersare personally familiar with the effects of the drug. As a result of their ownexperience, they then are more able to inform a prospective volunteer fullyregarding what to expect, and can be more empathetic during the actual drugstudies. Is the Sitter Tripping at the Same Time?It’s important to know if, at the time of a session, a sitter is under theinfluence of a psychedelic. It’s also important to determine how participantswill know whether or not the sitter takes a drug. Often, in shamanic orindigenous settings, the leader also partakes of a psychedelic substance, thoughperhaps at a lower dose than the participants in order to retain the ability tomove around and interact. This empathetic resonance among those who areexperiencing a particular drug effect helps the sitter provide an especiallydeep level of support and guidance. In Western models, however, this is anevolving area; some leaders ingest pschedelics, others do not. In an academic setting, it is unlikely that the researcher will also use thesame psychedelic substance during the study period. The extraordinarily rarepossibility exists that a sitter under the influence of the same drug would alsobe the object of study. For example, a research project might ask whether atherapist is more or less helpful while affected by the same psychedelic used byparticipants. Whatever the case, answers to the question of the leader’s use ofthe drug should be addressed ahead of time. There have been a number ofsituations in which group leaders have acted inappropriately while intoxicated,crossing important boundaries and later using as an excuse the effects of thedrug. ACCOUTREMENTS Music can evoke profound effects in a highly psychedelicized individual. Itusually is easier to arrange music beforehand, either by the solo tripper or, inthe case of a group session, in consultation with the sitter if there is one. Ina group setting, it is advisable to consider a “veto” rule regarding music: Ifanyone finds the music intolerable, it must be discontinued. Music withunderstandable lyrics can sometimes be distracting or can constrain theexperience. Instrumental music or world music with lyrics that areunintelligible may allow for more fluidity in reaction to it. Playing musicalinstruments in a solo setting may help a participant express nonverbal,nonvisual elements of a trip. In a group setting, however, participants musttake into account the reactions of other group members. Art supplies, particularly during the “coming down,” resolution period of atrip, can aid in giving form, shape, and color to otherwise nonverbal aspects ofthe experience. Writing materials also may be helpful, and in solo settings, avoice-recording device can capture fleeting ideas. Some people find looking intoa mirror while tripping to be particularly evocative, especially in a sessionwith a primarily spiritual or psychotherapeutic focus. Similarly, reviewingfamily photos from the past and present can stimulate the release of manyemotions and insights. SUPPLEMENTAL TECHNIQUES There are many nondrug-based methods available for altering consciousness. Thesemay be helpful in refocusing attention for those who might feel adrift in thepsychedelic space or who might be physically uncomfortable. Examples of thesetechniques include yoga, massage, and a quiet form of meditation. Othertechniques may help participants break through a particular psychic impasse in atrip. These include controlled hyperventilation, singing, dancing, and exercise.It’s a good idea to be familiar and comfortable with these ancillary techniquesbefore trying them in a psychedelicized condition. It’s also important thatparticipants not expose themselves to stressful or traumatic interventionsunless that is one of the purposes of the trip. For example, participants maywish to work through their resistance to a particular yoga posture that theynormally find too difficult to attain. TYPES OF TRIPS Keep in mind that despite the type of trip we wish to have, and despite decidingupon the dose, where we are, who we are with, and the activities available tous, we may not have the kind of experience we wanted. For example, we may expecta relatively minor, pleasurable experience, but may instead reach a near-deathstate. We must be ready for anything to occur during a trip, no matter how mucheffort we expend in preparation. Also, it is rare that any one trip consists ofonly one particular type. Psychedelic experiences are notoriously varied. Weenter and exit many levels during any one session. Nevertheless, there aregeneral types of sessions and advisable related parameters. Aesthetic, Pleasure-oriented TripsThese journeys may occur outside, in an environment of natural beauty, or theymay occur in a setting of man-made beauty that features music, art, orarchaeological relics. Ideally, participants will have access to bothenvironments. If we are alone, we may take a walk in the woods, visit a museum,play or listen to music, or get a massage. For this type of trip occurringsolely in an urban setting, it is best to take a low dose of psychedelic. These types of trips lend themselves to group experiences. Examples of largegroup settings include contemporary “raves”—large-venue dance events—and eventssuch as Burning Man, in the Nevada desert, where tens of thousands of peoplecongregate. Also fitting this type of intention are smaller groups, such asseveral friends who “hang out” together and enjoy each other’s company in apsychedelic state. Usually, these are sessions without a sitter or leader. The spontaneity andfreedom that we seek in such a setting, with doses generally being relativelylow, do not require much supervision. It’s a good idea, however, to make certainthat noninebriated people are available who know of participants’ condition andwhereabouts. Problem-solving SessionsWe may decide to use a psychedelic drug to help work on personal, professional,or creative concerns. Lower and intermediate doses provide more ease inmaintaining focus on these issues and recalling our solutions when we returnfrom our journey. Enhancing creativity with psychedelics may occur outdoors or indoors, dependingupon the particular task. An unobtrusive sitter can help record our newapproaches to problems, and can provide encouragement and focus. We may wanthelp within the context of a psychotherapeutic process, using the effects ofpsychedelics to modify the processes by which psychological healing occurs—thatis, projection, transference, abreaction, and catharsis. In psychotherapeuticsessions, it’s usually helpful to have someone acting as a sitter. This may beour own therapist or someone whom we only work with in psychedelic sessions. Ina psychotherapeutic group setting, some people may be in therapy with thesitter, while others may not. Lower doses in the psychotherapeutic setting allow for a better focus thanhigher ones, and provide the basis of psycholytic psychotherapy. High-dosesessions, referred to as psychedelic psychotherapy, add the qualitatively uniquespiritual, mystical, or near-death states to the quantitative augmentation ofnormal psychotherapeutic processes. Religious and spiritual issues often becomeconscious and important in psychedelic psychotherapy. If we are working on interpersonal issues, we and those with whom we want towork through these problems might be journeying together. We may choose to beginthe session solo and later come together with other group members. Because ofthe sometimes intense dynamics that may arise even with low or medium doses, itis helpful to have a sitter in this type of session. One model of psychedelic psychotherapy combines high doses of drug withoverpowering, multimodal sensory stimulation in an indoor group setting. Thisparticular technique is intended to cause a breakdown of psychological defensesnot deemed possible by any one modality alone. Yet such experiences aredifficult to negotiate and later to integrate. It is usually easier to work on psychological issues in an indoor setting,although access to the natural world can provide a necessary balance for theintense inner work that engages participants. SPIRITUAL, NEAR-DEATH, AND OTHERWORLDLY EXPERIENCES These breakthrough experiences usually lend themselves to large-dose,introspective, solo settings. They also require the most in terms of our abilityto let go and open ourselves to highly unusual effects. If we choose involvementin a group setting, the emphasis usually remains on an individual’s experience,at least in the initial and middle stages of the trip. It is easier for us to maintain an inward focus in an indoor setting.Nevertheless, nature can provide powerful catalysts for such experiences. If wedecide to take this type of trip outdoors, we must do our best to ensure thatparticipants are safe and free from unexpected disturbances. If there is a sitter, he or she is unlikely to be a minister of any organizedreligion. Rather, those trained in the shamanic tradition are usually capable ofcontaining and guiding these types of sessions. In the postindustrial West,sitters are often psychologically or spiritually trained individuals with theirown psychedelic experience. Supplemental techniques such as controlledhyperventilation can be useful in providing the final impetus for the desiredbreakthrough. As alluded to earlier, these types of experiences usually require us to beplaced into uncomfortable inner spaces. The giving up of cherished self-conceptsand identifications necessary to emerge anew into our reality is nearly alwaysquite distressing at some point—and once we have had this type of experience,there is little social support for discussing its merits within the largersocial mainstream. Social and spiritual support to help integrate such deepexperiences is necessary, and must be part of the preparation for any plannedbreakthrough session. VOLUNTEERING TO BE IN A RESEARCH STUDY Any of these types of trips can be experienced within the research setting.Volunteering to be a research subject, however, even for a study that mayprovide benefit—such as psychotherapy, mysticism, or creativityresearch—involves the element of altruism, of giving up something in our owntrip for the greater good. This altruism generates a unique dynamic between usand our setting, particularly to those in the room with us. When we volunteerfor a research study, the trip is not all ours. We are being asked—and areexpected—to provide data and information rather than just have an experience forour own sake. While this is neither intrinsically good nor bad, theinformed-consent process must be open and transparent and this altruism must beacknowledged at the outset. From the beginning, there exist competing interestsbetween our trip and the data we are generating—and we will not be allowed toforget this give-and-take that’s superimposed upon our trip. It’s important thatresearch subjects not be surprised by, rebel against, or resent the exigenciesof providing data. For example, as we may be traversing the deepest reaches ofinner space, our vein may clot, and the nurse will flush the intravenous linewith jarringly cold water or he or she might need to remove the line and replaceit with another. Those who are neophytes to psychedelic states must consider these issuescarefully. “Sharing” a trip in this way can be likened to having our firstsexual experience observed, with data and specimens collected. We might be moregenerous with our time, body, mind, and soul after we’ve gained some experienceand familiarity with such new and intense experiences. Nevertheless, it ispossible to participate in a research setting during our first psychedelicexperience and have it turn out better than one we undergo alone or withfriends. Perhaps the setting takes into account our inexperience and is designedto determine those factors that contribute to the best outcome. Such researchprojects are rare, though, and regardless of their intent, they must stillcollect data. Research settings are characterized by a relatively constrained physicalenvironment. They are almost always indoors, range of movement is restricted,and there are few surprises. Generally speaking, accoutrements or supplementalconsciousness-altering methods are few or unavailable. These constraints areintended to keep constant as many variables as possible while modifying onlythose of interest. For example, the researcher may vary the dose of drug in theexact same setting to determine the effects of dose on the measured variablessuch as heart rate and blood pressure. It is interesting to note that though theusual hospital research unit is not especially peaceful, there we may have asense of medical security—for instance, knowing that a cardiac resuscitationteam is nearby—that is otherwise absent. In these studies, we are usually theonly one in the environment taking a psychedelic drug. Once we have decided to participate in research, there are two general typesfrom which to choose: biological and psychological. The emphasis in the formeris on data regarding our body, and the emphasis in the latter is on dataregarding our mind. Biological studies may include subjective effects in theirpurview. They are called psychopharmacological—that is, seeking thepharmacological underpinnings of subjective experiences. Psychobiologicalstudies, or psychophysiological studies, attempt to explicate the physiology ofthe mind. For example, these may assess the effects of psychedelics oninvoluntary aspects of perception, such as how we respond to images presented toone or both eyes using various sequences and time intervals. The tools used in biological research may include brain-imaging equipment, someof which may be noisy and tight-fitting and may involve being injected with aradioactive drug. Participants may have blood drawn to quantify levels of anynumber of factors: hormones, immune function, and metabolism of the drug inquestion or other drugs. Body temperature may be monitored, as maycardiovascular responses such as blood pressure and heart rate using anautomatic blood pressure cuff. Psychological studies can be divided into roughly two different categories:problem solving and phenomenological. We have previously discussed some of theparameters involved in problem solving with psychedelics, as well as thedifference in psychotherapeutic work between lower-dose psycholytic andhigher-dose psychedelic therapy. In the research setting, the goals are similarbut the structure is more rigorously adhered to. Phenomenologically based psychological studies focus on the mental rather thanbiological effects of psychedelics—that is, perception of time, color, distance,and depth. Rather than assessing perceptual, information-processing mentalfunctions, psychoanalytic studies may investigate more-complex phenomena such asprojection, transference, mood reactivity, and free association. Finally, studies may investigate the efficacy of psychedelics in elicitingmystical, near-death, and otherworldly experiences. These are somewhat moredifficult to categorize within a research setting because they deal withconcepts that, for many, fall outside of the purview of traditional scientificinquiry. Nevertheless, they partake of the general research model, limitingvariables as much as possible and providing data to the research team. LETTING GO Once we have completed as much preparatory work as possible before a session andclarified our intent—thus choosing our setting—we are ready to turn ourattention to the actual trip. On the day of the session, we should be well rested and clear-eyed, feelingready for whatever may come our way. Though it’s a good idea to have water orice chips available during the session to address thirst and dehydration, aperson should not plan on eating any food or drinking alcohol. The fundamental task required for an optimal psychedelic experience is somewhatparadoxical: It consists of actively establishing the direction in which wedecide to let go. We consciously choose the cliff from which we will jump andwith what attitude we make that leap. This is especially the case in high-dosesessions during which we hope to encounter the most radical and unusualexperiences. Resistance to high-dose, powerful trips can be extraordinarily painful andconfusing. An opened-eyed, level-headed surrendering of resistance is the mosteffective way to prevent being thrown into this maelstrom and is the best methodfor pulling ourselves out of it if we do find ourselves overboard. Prayers,mantras, mudras, visualization, music, bodywork, and other aids may be helpfulat various points in our trip to redirect the flow of experience. At thedeepest, most exposed, raw, and vulnerable moments of the psychedelic encounter,however, it is only through letting go that we find ourselves making the mostprogress. From the five minutes of the DMT flash to the twelve hours of anibogaine ordeal, this surrender is the crux of a successful journey. The foundation laid by any previous inner work will hold us in good stead atsuch times by virtue of the attention skills we have developed. These skillsmake it easier to remain focused when confronted with the unexpected. Inaddition, effective psychotherapy or spiritual practice will have made usfamiliar with the skeletons in our closets and will have better equipped us tocontend with them if and when they emerge. Thus, not only do we clearly perceivewhat is garnering our attention, but also we subsequently open up and drop ourresistances to it. We will know when we are resisting and when we are movingforward at any given moment of the psychedelic experience. Yet it is not only in negative aspects of a trip that we may become blocked. Wealso might be unable to move out of pleasant or neutral states. For example, wemight find ourselves deeply blissful but also sense that we can go even deeperinto what lies beneath and supports that bliss. Seemingly innocuous images orfeelings, such as the curtain of psychedelic lights that is often a hallmark ofthe drug experience, may stand in our way. We want to see even more, but wecannot take the next step. All these states can be managed to facilitate our moving forward; we can slowdown, right ourselves, and then go on. We regain our balance through the properapplication of attention and awareness. This is the slowing down, which we canfacilitate physically through relaxed, deep breathing and helps release anytension in our bodies. Once we’ve slowed ourselves down and replanted ourpsychic feet, it is easier to move our consciousness through the resistance orblock. Sometimes, however, we may not feel we have a body to relax or lungsthrough which to breathe. At these times, it may be useful simply to bring ourminds back to what is happening, and to approach it in a positive, bright, andcurious manner. For example, in my DMT work, I prepared volunteers by warningthem that they might find themselves convinced that they had died. They couldreact in one of two ways: “Oh, my God, I’m dying—get me out of here!” or “I seemto have died. Very interesting. What’s next?” This approach creates the smallest space between being aware of an object (suchas an emotion, thought, or perception) and having a relationship with it—inother words, just before we establish a relationship with it. The leverageexists in that microsecond gap; we become aware of the stuck or static nature ofthe relationship. Then, taking a psychic deep breath, we can pull back from itever so slightly, enough to work ourselves through or out of the block. Forexample, with respect to the curtain of psychedelic lights, we can look forspace or cracks within it and then pass through it. ENCOUNTERING BEINGS One of the most profound aspects of a psychedelic session is contact with alienor noncorporeal, spiritual, or invisible beings or entities. Upon experiencingsuch an encounter, the first task we must pursue is to regain our composure fromthe shock of meeting what appear to be sentient creatures in our newlydiscovered worlds—creatures that, in many instances, seem to have been waitingfor us. Next, we are faced with how to relate to them. Some beings appear to be kind, gentle, and concerned for our welfare. Othersseem to be aggressive, angry, and hurtful. Some present in an ambiguous ormischievous manner. They may communicate more or less effectively or they mayignore us altogether. While their sheer novelty and unexpectedness make us feela sense of awe, it may be best, whenever possible, to appraise them with thesame objectivity with which we would judge any chance encounter with strangers.At the time of such encounters, we don’t know these beings’ language or culture,nor do we know their intent. As with all elements of the psychedelic experience,it’s important not to become obsessed with them or our reaction to them. Once weestablish a modicum of stability in our interactions with them and have decidedthey are “safe,” we can engage them in any number of ways—we can seek theirhelp, advice, love, and healing. Keep in mind, however, the flux of thepsychedelic experience, and do not be surprised if these beings morph readilyinto the opposite of everything that we had considered them the moment before. Entities with fangs, poisonous-looking appendages, and other clearly menacingfeatures usually are not benign, and it is best to be very wary of them. We canlisten to what they have to say, but we ought not to be in any hurry to followtheir advice. On the other hand, strange or frightening entities that seem tounderstand our fears may be more beneficent, particularly if they modify theirbehavior or appearance in response to our anxiety. Even if their appearance andbehavior repel us, more-benign entities usually do not force us to do or acceptthings or become angry with us if we do not agree to their requests. Inaddition, we should never make any contract with the beings for doing evil orharm to another person or thing. THE BAD TRIP Though we can try to ensure that we have a smooth session, it is the norm tohave difficult, painful periods in at least part of any major psychedelicexperience. These can range from transient anxiety to prolonged psychosis. Morethan 99 percent of the time in someone medically and psychologically healthy,properly screened, prepared, and supervised, such distressing moments areshort-lived and leave little if any aftermath. Nevertheless, being prepared fordifficult stretches in a session can help us manage them more easily. Anxiety and fear are relatively common as we begin to enter into the psychedelicstate—when we are “coming on” to the drug effect. Simply relaxing physically andmentally—for example, slowing and calming our breathing—is often sufficient todispel these jitters. If we are with a sitter or in a supportive group, we mayask to have someone lay a hand upon us in a nonerotic manner or to hold ourhand. Sometimes placing a blanket over the body or removing uncomfortably heavyclothes or coverings can also help by allowing us to reconnect with our bodies.Once we are in the midst of the experience, we can deal with unpleasant periodsin a variety of ways. The simple breathing or physical contact suggestionsoutlined here can be helpful in refocusing us on the flowing, dynamic nature ofthe experience and can get us out of a rut. More-intense or prolonged confusion,anxiety, fear, anger, or grief may require more-active intervention, either onour behalf or on the behalf of those with us—that is, the sitter or groupmembers. Quieting the environment—turning off the music, turning down the lights, lyingdown—can be helpful. Such maneuvers allow us to pay attention to what isimportant: our inner state. Soothing interventions may be necessary, however. Awarm or cool compress on the forehead; mild, nonintrusive, and nonsexualmassage; and quiet, melodious humming or singing can help replace themore-tumultuous inner workings of our minds with quieter thoughts and visions. For more-intense disturbances, there are a range of options: Someone may perhapshave to hug us or even lie on top of us to help us to ground ourselves. A coldshower, ice cubes down the back of our shirt, and other firmly yet gentlyadministered strategies can help break any vicious cycles in which we findourselves. Controlled hyperventilation can also help push us through anyparticularly tenacious disturbing states. Finally, there is the option of using medication to interrupt an especiallyout-of-control situation—but such instances are extraordinarily rare. For manyof us, however, it can be quite reassuring to know that a medication isavailable to pull us out of almost any negative spiral if we are unable to do soourselves. Usually, a benzodiazepine such as alprazolam or lorazepam issufficient, but the sedating side effects of these interventions—which can lastfor hours—must be taken into account. Antipsychotic medications are a lastresort, and come with their own host of unpleasant side effects. COMING DOWN AND REINTEGRATING After a trip, we must be kind to ourselves. It’s best to allow for one or twodays between a session and resumption of normal, everyday activities. It’s alsoimportant to rest, eat healthy food, drink plenty of liquids, and get severalnights of good sleep. Rest. Most of all, we must consider what we justexperienced. After a session, we should write, draw, or record in some way theimages, feelings, ideas, body sensations, and perceptions we contacted. Weshould share and process our experience with others whom we trust: we may sharewith someone who either did or did not join us for our trip; with our sitter; orwith a shaman, minister, or therapist. We must review the aspects of the tripthat continue to draw our attention. GETTING HELP While most people can integrate even major psychedelic drug experiencesrelatively well, some sessions—especially our first ones—may be traumatic.Generally, by the time the session is winding down, a well-integrated experienceresolves itself into a sense of happy satisfaction with our session. Intense,unshakable, powerful emotions such as sadness, anxiety, fear, or anger mayforetell unpleasant postsession feelings. Intense or prolonged negative after effects may occur, and these can range fromanxiety and depression to psychosis. Added to these potential negative outcomesare the stigma associated with psychedelic drugs and their illegality. Thesefactors make seeking help more problematic. Nevertheless, when we feel we needhelp, we must search for it. If we have taken our trip with others or if we weresupervised by a sitter, it is best to start with them when asking forappropriate referrals for follow-up. Such after-session follow-up may range froman hour or two decompressing with a knowledgeable friend to psychiatrichospitalization. In between these two extremes is the common feeling that wehave confronted issues we are not psychologically or spiritually mature enoughto integrate. We may recognize that a course of inner work must now ensue inorder to use the session optimally and in a healthy way. INTEGRATION Even after relatively trauma-free sessions, we are faced with a daunting task:What do we do with all this information? It may be a case of “Now for the hardpart . . .” We may ask ourselves if we will trip again, and we may wonder why orhow we will if we choose to try another session. Perhaps most important, we mayask ourselves if we plan to change anything about our life: our career,relationships, diet, drug use, or religious views or practices. Finally, we mayask whether we have begun a new phase of inner or outer work. It may take a while for a big trip to fully exert its effects—we need space andtime for the ripples to reach the shore. We may have to live many years to fullydigest and manifest the results of a big journey. It’s important to be patientwith ourselves and not to become frustrated that more has not changed in ourlives as a result of what appeared, at the outset, to be a life-changingexperience. More drug trips may not be the answer; perhaps what’s necessary is asober, concerted application in our everyday life of what we experienced. image [images/00003.jpg] Though we should not push ourselves, we also do ourselves a disservice byallowing a trip to be forgotten, filed away in some dusty recesses of our mindas just one more interesting experience. We must remember that in a psychedelictrip, we’ve been given a tremendous gift, one that very few people ever have theopportunity to receive and experience. "},{"pageContent":"image [images/00004.jpg] 12image [images/00004.jpg] The Sacred Voyage Beyond Science Fiction? Slawek Wojtowicz, M.D. Science fiction has always been very good at predicting the future: fromsubmarines and spaceships imagined by Jules Verne to communicators from StarTrek, we have seen many seemingly far-fetched ideas come to fruition. Soon wemay see many more science-fiction inventions and concepts come true—perhaps timetravel (almost a thousand papers on this topic have recently been published inprofessional journals); travel in hyperspace or other dimensions; the discoveryof multiple universes (string theory); the existence of antigravity (darkenergy); teleportation (see the research on quantum entanglement); transport andcommunication with supraluminal speed (wormholes, signal nonlocality); and eveninvisibility cloaks. The future promises to be very exciting indeed. Many of usare very impatient, however, and we can’t wait much longer for these inventionsto change our lives. We yearn to experience right now the taste of things tocome. Yet is this possible? As computer geeks keep telling us, information is everything. More and more,scientists working in fields as diverse as those of quantum physics, astronomy,and molecular biology are telling us the same thing, though perhaps moreaccurately: Everything is information. Thanks to the spread of computers and theexplosion of the Internet, information is the new superparadigm for theorists.Just as Newtonian physics was based on the paradigm of the clockwork universe,the information technology (IT) revolution has inspired scientists to see all interms of information. By information, however, physicists don’t necessarily mean simple bits of data.Instead, they refer to a more fundamental, underlying principle of theuniverse—a principle from which all things are made. John Wheeler, perhaps themost distinguished proponent of information theory, claimed that, fundamentally,atoms are made up of bits of information. As he put it in a 1989 lecture, “Itsare from bits.” He elaborated: “Every it—every particle, every field of force,even the space–time continuum itself—derives its function, its meaning, its veryexistence entirely from binary choices, bits. What we call reality arises in thelast analysis from the posing of yes/no questions.” Those of a more religiousbent might suggest that all things physical have a spiritual or nonmaterialorigin. Wheeler argues that this strange state is an inevitable consequence of the nowfamiliar oddities of quantum mechanics. At its fundamental level, reality isfuzzy, its exact nature undetermined until observed—a concept most famouslyillustrated by Schrdinger’s cat in a box: the cat can be simultaneously bothdead and alive before we open the box. DO WE LIVE IN A DREAM WORLD? How many of us realize that a wide spectrum of uniquely human activities has itsroots in altered states of consciousness (ASCs)? Origins of all religions, art(going all the way back to cave paintings created thirty thousand to fortythousand years ago), spiritual and shamanic healing, and even the creation ofcivilization itself (as seen in chapter 9) can be traced back to ASCexperiences. Even the history of science gives us plenty of examples ofinspiration that comes from beyond consensus reality. One well-known instance is the story of the organic molecule known as benzene.The formula of benzene (C6H6) mystified scientists, who could not figure out itsstructure. German chemist Friedrich August von Kekul, however, who laid thegroundwork for the modern structural theory in organic chemistry, came up with asolution that provided a satisfactory explanation. In 1861, after years ofstudying carbon bonding, benzene, and related organic molecules, he had a dreamof whirling snakes in which he saw one of the snakes seizing its own tail. Hewoke up with a start. He’d experienced the “Eureka!” moment that gave him thestructure of benzene—which is made up of a ring of carbon atoms. In 1929 theringlike nature of benzene was confirmed by the eminent crystallographerKathleen Lonsdale. Another, more recent story is that of Francis Crick, whoreportedly came up with the double-helix structure of DNA—the most significantbiological discovery of the twentieth century—while under the influence of LSD.Of course, that discovery won him the Nobel Prize (shared with James Watson). By now it should be clear that psychedelics can produce an astounding variety ofexperiences—from meetings with aliens and time travel to journeys into thespirit world and mystical revelation. Yet is there an internally consistentexplanation that can make sense of these experiences? Interestingly, bothmystical religions and modern quantum physics seem to agree concerning the truenature of reality: time and space are just constructs of human consciousnesscreated by our minds. The reality we perceive as solid and independent doesn’treally exist on its own; it is simply a projection emanating from our minds.Some call it Maya, a dream, an illusion, and others describe it as afull-immersion movie that’s better than the one that could be experienced on aholodeck in Star Trek. Is it possible that we live in a dream world or, to use more modern terminology,in a very sophisticated virtual-reality simulation? As Rick Strassman hashypothesized here, DMT may be the molecule that is responsible for maintainingthe illusion in which we live. Those who are science-fiction fans won’t beshocked by this supposition. Similar concepts have been explored thoroughly inscience-fiction novels and in movies such as The Matrix, Waking Life, andeXistenZ.1 [index_split_017.html#filepos875425] Since we are the source of thedream, it appears so real and familiar to us that we cannot even tell that it’sjust a dream. This is an idea that many of us may have a great deal of difficulty accepting.From the absolute point of view, the relative doesn’t really exist.Nevertheless, at a very fundamental level, the relative does exist. It is thisstrange dynamic between the relative and the absolute that is perhaps one of theways DMT and similar endogenous molecules play a role in our lives. At thedeepest, spiritual level of awareness, this reality is some sort of weirdprojection. Yet where most of us are most of the time—even the most enlightenedamong us—is the relative everyday level that we need to learn to negotiate asskillfully as possible. The biggest illusion of all is that we appear to be separate, individual beings.Mystics across all religions, whether Zen or Tibetan Buddhists, Sufis in Islam,Kabbalah practitioners in Judaism, or gnostics in Christianity, agree that thereis only one actor playing all the parts in this virtual-reality movie. Thatactor is God, the same one who is responsible for the creation of our universe.He is you and I as well as all other sentient beings. The mind of the Divineforms the essence of our own mind. Therefore, when we learn how to unite withthe Source, we will know how to reach across time and space—anywhere in theuniverse—simply by looking deep within. Each of us may be able to open the doors in our mind that lead to the entireuniverse: a much more incredible and exciting notion than any science-fictionstory! So how do we do this? Many have performed this feat in the past: Jesusand Buddha are perfect examples, but there are countless others who managed toaccess the universe with equal success, though with less publicity. Most ofthose who sporadically use psychedelics don’t learn how to control access tothese gateways: lacking the training and proper preparation, they stumblethrough their psychedelic experiences and don’t know how to return to aparticular location they visited once before. Notable exceptions are shamans andyogis. Their specialty is exploration of other realities. They learn how toaccess and travel in these regions safely; they make maps of alien realms andpass this knowledge to apprentices, from generation to generation. Becoming a shaman requires awakening from the dream in which we all areimmersed. But what exactly does it mean to be awake? Do we really have to takethe red pill, like Neo in The Matrix, to awaken and learn what’s real and what’snot? SCIENCE FICTION AS A PATH TO AWAKENING What exactly is enlightenment or awakening, and why is it so difficult toachieve? Why do only a few of us manage to awaken from the not-sohappy dream inwhich we appear to live? What is the information or wisdom attainable in thepsychedelic state that can lead to enlightenment? Mystical religions tell us that the root of all unhappiness and suffering is ourignorance concerning the nature of reality. We suffer because we chase aftercertain illusions (such as sex, money, fame, or power) and we are afraid ofothers (fear of death or of your boss is a good example!) because we think theyare real. The prerequisite for awakening is a personal experience of the truenature of reality—it is not enough to hear or read about it or believe that welive in a dream. Psychedelics can provide exactly that: firsthand experience ofother, otherwise unseen realities. It is essential to experience thesefirsthand, but even this is not enough for awakening to occur. Once we gain this initial experience, the hard work begins: we must shed all ourdeeply ingrained preconceptions about the world and about ourselves and changethe way we think. We must live the knowledge, instead of experiencing it solelyon an intellectual level. Jesus put it this way (as we can read in the Gospel ofMark 8:34, New International Version): “If anyone would come after me, he mustdeny himself and take up his cross and follow me.” This is hardest to do, yet itis absolutely necessary to reach the next stage of evolution. If you are anarcissist, you must became selfless; if you are lazy, you must turn into adiligent worker; if you are a slob, you must become neat; if you smoke, you mustquit; if you are intolerant, you must open up and accept others as they are—andso on. This is where the proper integration of the psychedelic experience andtraditional religion might provide a cross-fertilization that can benefit bothsides of the aisle: psychedelicists can study the wisdom teachings of religionsto learn how to manifest the sometimes inchoate wisdom they touch in thepsychedelic state, and religious practitioners who lack deep, intuitiveunderstanding of their tradition’s teachings can have their own spiritualexperience that confirms and expands what they know only intellectually. To awaken, we must transcend ourselves—to become more than our sense of aseparate self. In other words, we must learn to be selfless and think aboutothers first, to serve others before we take care of our own needs. A shaman canhelp us get started and can help us reach our goal much more quickly, because heor she has firsthand knowledge of the spiritual realm and knows how to usepsychedelics and other trance-inducing methods such as drumming or dancing. Ofcourse, we can also arrive at this place through years of diligent meditationand through many other means. In fact, we are all on a spiritual path, even ifsome of us don’t realize it yet. Science fiction also happens to be one of the roads to enlightenment. It opensus up to new ideas, no matter how incredible they may appear. Remember thatfirst interracial kiss on Star Trek? Being open-minded is a prerequisite forenlightenment. Questioning all presumptions, dogmas, and taboos leads to deeperand deeper levels of understanding. Being accepting and tolerant of others isyet another step in the right direction—and science-fiction fans are often moreopen-minded than the general population. In addition, many writers tacklespiritual matters under the guise of science fiction. In fact, it is difficultto find a science-fiction or fantasy novel or movie that does not touch on theseissues in one way or another. Science-fiction literature teaches us that the distinction is blurred betweenwhat we think is real and what is not. It shows that dreams can be totallyindistinguishable from waking reality. When we are immersed in a dream, ourcritical mind is turned off and we can’t tell that we are dreaming until we areawakened. We fly in the air, fight with aliens, travel in time, or surviveencounters with dragons, but we don’t question how these things are possible. Wedon’t, that is, until we wake up. The same principle applies to our consensusreality—we think it is all real until we wake up and realize that it’s just astrange dream, like our nocturnal dreams. The popularity of movies such as Star Wars, The Matrix, Total Recall, Cube, andDark City2 [index_split_017.html#filepos875930] has helped to spread the ideasknown to mystics for millennia. Movies such as Star Wars show us that there areinvisible spiritual powers at play, affecting our lives whether or not weacknowledge them. Even though we may feel like insignificant pawns in the gameof life, our power rests in the ability to choose how we respond to challengesthat fate places in front of us—and it is never too late to change our mind, asDarth Vader’s example shows. The Matrix was likely inspired by the gnostic gospels (many of them destroyed bythe Church and rediscovered only fifty years ago in Nag Hammadi, Egypt),including the Gospel of Thomas, in which Jesus says: “Those who seek should notstop seeking until they find. When they find, they will be disturbed. When theyare disturbed, they will marvel, and they will reign over all.”3[index_split_017.html#filepos876679] This sounds rather mysterious and exciting.Some experts suspect that the Gospel of Thomas might be older than the canonicalgospels included in the Christian scriptures, and is therefore closer to thesource and more likely to be true to the actual message of Jesus. We may ask whythe Church branded such writings as heretical and attempted to eradicate thesegospels. One possible “secret” reason for suppression of these gospels in the West (inaddition to their outright political threat to the monopoly of the Church—afterall, who needs priests and bishops if we can experience God directly?) was themetaphysical terror experienced by those who uncovered only part of the truth:Yes, we may be divine inside, but there is only one of us; we are TOTALLY ALONE(and, while this has to be experienced to understand it, anything—even wars,pain, and suffering encountered in this world—is better than being totallyalone). We are separated from God and stuck in hell—bound to repeat our mistakesover and over again in an infinite number of reincarnations. We can’t really dieand there appears to be no way out of this nightmare. . . . This theme has been explored in movies such as Abre los ojos4[index_split_017.html#filepos876903] (and its Hollywood remake Vanilla Sky),Groundhog Day, and The Fountain.5 [index_split_017.html#filepos877144] Mysticsalso tell us that there is no personal God as described by mainstream religionssuch as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, but instead there is a field ofpotentiality or energy that can be experienced as pure love. Gnostics calledthis field pleroma (a Greek word that translates as “fullness”), and in Hinduismand Buddhism it is known as Brahma or Brahman. We might envision ourselves on aholodeck that creates everything that we imagine. . . . The trouble begins whenwe forget who we are and that we are totally alone and when we begin fightingwith figments of our imagination. When we are lost in fear and lash out in angerat the “outside” world, the aggression bounces right back. We only hurtourselves when we try to injure “others.” . . . Fortunately, the same ruleapplies to love and compassion: The more we put them “out there,” the more comesback our way. Some say that ignorance is bliss; some people have believed that it is better toprotect us from the “horrible” truth that there is only one of us. According tothis view, it is an ultimate virtue to protect us from anything that wouldshorten the bliss of ignorance. When we grow inevitably unhappy (because none ofus is spared disease, suffering, and death), we may begin seeking and maydiscover the truth of our real condition and experience the terror of ultimateloneliness. This experience may discourage us from venturing farther intospiritual realms. Though we would rather forget such experience, unfortunatelyit is impossible to forget. Here, then, is another way in which psychedelics mayprove valuable in the mystic quest: they preside over a more controlled,regulated, and gradual exposure to this initially terrifying existentialrealization. Neo in The Matrix is a good example of a seeker who finds a way to awaken fromthe daze of the dream. He realizes that his life is meaningless and starts tosearch for answers. Just as in our consensus reality, his search is bound to befruitful, and our hero discovers that he has been living in a dream, in avirtual reality created by a supercomputer. As any who have seen the movie willrecall, it was the red pill that helped to awaken him. Yet what was inside thepill? A careful viewing of the movie reveals a clue during Neo’s encounter witha white rabbit. Inside the pill was a psychedelic: peyote. Polish writer Stanislaw Lem was among the first to toy with the idea of virtualreality. In a short story entitled “Lymphater’s Formula,”6[index_split_017.html#filepos877491] he describes an advanced computer that iscapable of dreaming. In his dreams, the computer is a beautiful girl. In TheFuturological Congress, Lem’s space adventurer Ijon Tichy wakes up fromsuspended animation in the future and finds that people now routinely consumepsychedelic drugs that can induce realistic hallucinations or waking dreams.Instead of merely watching movies, they live out their virtual-realityfantasies. Tichy acclimates himself slowly to this strange new existence. Soon,however, he realizes with growing panic that he is trapped in a world in whichthe worst in humanity has been brought out by the power to perfectly simulatereality. Tichy learns that nothing in this society is what it appears to be. He discoversthat a pharmacological dictatorship has been secretly subjecting the populationto another set of psychedelic drugs to induce a collective hallucination. As aresult, everyone sees a utopia of luxury, well-tended nature, and advancedtechnology when the economy, the environment, and the physical integrity of thepeople themselves are actually in a state of near collapse. Toward the end ofthe novel, Symington (who turns out to be the dictator behind this falseparadise) tells Tichy: “We keep this civilization drugged, for otherwise itcould not endure itself. That is why its sleep must not be disturbed. . . .”7[index_split_017.html#filepos877726] Similarly, many of Philip K. Dick’s novels explore spiritual themes. Ubik is aclassic example, with multiple layers of reality and unreality embedded withinthe plot.8 [index_split_017.html#filepos877961] We meet the protagonist, JoeChip, shortly before an explosion at a moon base that almost kills him and hiscolleagues. There is only one fatality: their boss, Glen Runciter. Or did Joeand the others die while their boss actually survived? If his boss is dead andJoe is alive, why does Joe keep getting strange messages from Glen? Is Joe’sexperience of his postaccident life just a hallucination, played out as hisfrozen body lies in suspended animation? Joe is very confused: he is convinced that he is the one trying to rescue GlenRunciter, but it quickly becomes clear that he himself is in a dire need ofrescue from the hell-like reality of half-life (a condition in which the deadare kept half alive, frozen for a prolonged period of time during which they canstill communicate with the living through sophisticated machinery). Readers ofthis story shudder upon recognizing that not only the first level of reality hasbeen exposed as false, but the second level, supposedly more real than thefirst, turns out to be an illusion too. The status of reality as such isundermined—nothing is real. Joe’s reality gradually disintegrates and he almost falls prey to the entropythat is one of the main ruling forces in his universe (and in ours). Everythinghe touches decays and collapses: cigarettes turn stale in the pack, mold growson coffee, and all of his friends disappear, presumably devoured by a nastycharacter named Jory. Joe is rescued at the last minute before dying by sprayinghimself with an aerosol called Ubik—the all-purpose “reality support” that nowbegins to materialize, fleetingly and tantalizingly, everywhere. Joe initiallybelieves that Ubik is supplied by his allies outside of half-life—specificallyhis boss. Later, it appears that Runciter’s wife, Elly, who is also sequesteredin half-life, provides the life-saving spray. Yet he realizes that this, too, isnot the truth, when Elly’s soul abandons half-life to reincarnate again. It is interesting that as Joe struggles to understand the source of thesurrounding reality, he always prefers to place it outside of himself. Hebelieves that it is Glen, Elly, or Jory who create his reality and try to eitherrescue or destroy him. Only toward the end of the story does it occur to acareful reader that Joe himself is the dreamer who creates the illusion of hisown reality. Ubik is a magical medicine that seems to promise fullness andrestoration to health, life, and plentitude, and Joe is apparently blocked fromthis fullness only by particular factors outside of his control: the pharmacy isclosed, it is out of stock, or the Ubik spray devolves into an earlier form ofitself, becoming a tin of liver balm. Ubik is both a gap in the realitystructure (pointing to something else beyond imperfect, impermanent, entropicreality) and a reality support, that which literally keeps us going. The backcover of the book tells what Ubik really is: “I am Ubik. Before the universewas, I am. I made the suns, I made the worlds. I created the lives, and theplaces they inhabit; I move them here, I put them there. They go as I say, theydo as I tell them, I am the word and my name is never spoken. The name which noone knows. I am called Ubik but that is not my name. I am. I shall always be.” Another example of this confusion of reality can be found in Total Recall,9[index_split_017.html#filepos878134] a movie inspired by one of Dick’s shortstories (“We Can Remember It for You Wholesale”). In this movie, it is equallyimpossible to tell what is waking reality and what is dream. Is ArnoldSchwarzenegger’s character dreaming, is his Mars adventure an implanted memoryor has it happened for real? Is he a hero or a brain-damaged dope? If nothing is real, can we choose the dream in which we would like to live, orcan we at least make sure that our dream is a good one and not a nightmare? Amodern gnostic gospel entitled A Course of Miracles10[index_split_017.html#filepos878394] and books based on it, such asDisappearance of the Universe by Gary Renard,11[index_split_017.html#filepos878602] claim that it is possible to change thenightmare into a happy dream without pain, suffering, and death. This is quite afantastic idea. It is interesting that A Course in Miracles also clearly statesthat we are deeply confused or even insane—even though we don’t realize it.Similar ideas are discussed in a movie called Waking Life,12[index_split_017.html#filepos878788] which poses crucial questions: Are wesleepwalking through our waking state or wake-walking through our dreams? Whycan’t we let go of our attachments and awaken? In another movie, entitled eXistenZ,13 [index_split_017.html#filepos879024]Allegra Geller, the world’s leading game designer, is testing her newvirtual-reality game, eXistenZ, with a focus group. As they begin, she isattacked by a fanatic assassin who employs a bizarre, organic gun. She fleeswith a young marketing trainee, Ted Pikul, who is suddenly assigned as herbodyguard. Unfortunately, her pod, an organic gaming device that contains theonly copy of the eXistenZ program, is damaged. To inspect it, she talks Ted intoaccepting a game port in his own body so that he can play the game with her. Theresulting game leads the pair on a strange adventure during which it isimpossible to determine what is real and what is not. Eventually, even Allegraherself turns out to be a game character, but Ted doesn’t quite grasp that hemay be hopelessly lost in a world created by his own mind. It begins innocentlyenough: Allegra: So how does it feel? Ted: What? Allegra: Your real life. The one you came back for. Ted: It feels completely unreal. Allegra: You’re stuck now, aren’t ya? You want to go back to the Chineserestaurant because there’s nothing happening here. We’re safe. It’s boring. Ted: It’s worse than that. I’m not sure . . . I’m not sure here, where we are,is real at all. This feels like a game to me. And you, you’re beginning to feela bit like a game character. The good news is that nobody really dies in the game; the bad news is thatnobody seems to know what is real and what is not. The movie Cube experiments with a similar idea—several people find themselves ina strange, seemingly alien maze that’s full of deadly traps. They don’t rememberhow they got there, but they realize that they have to work together to figureout a way to escape this nightmare before they die of dehydration or starvationor from being chopped up into pieces. To their horror, it appears that the Cube(the maze) was built by humans and not hostile aliens. Escape is almostimpossible because the rules of the game appear to change continuously. Theprisoners die, one by one, while the chances of escape seem to dwindle with theloss of each individual.14 [index_split_017.html#filepos879272] Dark City is a movie that explores Buddhist ideas of reincarnation and thenature of reality. It takes us to a city far away from Earth, an urban placebuilt by aliens who are trying to learn what makes us human. Every night atmidnight, people lose all memory of their prior life and their identities arechanged, as is the city itself. One day a person might be a rich merchant, andanother day he might be a thief, and still another day he might be a gas-stationattendant. The hero of the story, John Murdoch, awakens alone in a strange hotelto find that he has lost his memory and is wanted for a series of brutal andbizarre murders. While trying to piece together his past, he stumbles upon agroup of alien beings known as the Strangers, who possess the ability to putpeople to sleep and alter the city and its inhabitants. He discovers that almosteveryone else is completely unaware of what is happening. He struggles to wakeup other people and he succeeds eventually, at which time everyone is freed fromthe cruel experiment.15 [index_split_017.html#filepos879489] WHO ARE WE AND WHY ARE WE HERE? You may have heard the saying “The Truth will set you free,” the phrase from theGospel of John 8:32. It promises freedom to those who learn the truth. Mystics,however, tell us that most of us are living in a state of perpetual confusion:just like the characters in Dark City, we don’t know who we really are, we don’tremember how we got here and where we have been before, and, worst of all, wedon’t know how to escape from the trap into which we’ve fallen. Yet it looks like there is a way out of this quagmire. The good news, accordingto the mystics, is that we will eventually succeed in our efforts to escape fromhell. Just as in some of the movies mentioned here, however, there is only oneway out—and to find it, we must first awaken from the dream. We must realizethat salvation lies inside, not outside, of ourselves. Fortunately, we have beenprogrammed with the right clues to lead us to the escape hatch. We feel trulyhappy and peaceful only when we choose the right path: when we are selfless andwhen we don’t chase after illusions such as sex, money, or power. We all learneventually that blind attachment to these illusions makes us feel unhappy,anxious, fearful, restless, and miserable. In addition, we seem to bebiologically programmed—DMT-synthesizing genes exist in the human body and maybe turned on precisely at these moments. We’ve got both the “hardware” and the“software.” The Buddhist tradition teaches of the tripod of the illusory world—greed,hatred, and delusion—and their antidotes—compassion, love, and wisdom. In thistradition, wisdom is the road that ultimately leads to enlightenment. Here,wisdom can be understood as the “information” attainable through shamanic,psychedelic, or other types of spiritual experience. After the acquisition ofwisdom comes the translation of this information into action—love andcompassion. When we start to awaken, we realize that we have been living in a dream, that weare the actor playing all the roles, and that to achieve the next step ofevolution (and to find happiness), we must transcend our limited sense of beingseparate selves. Even though it appears that each of us is a unique individualhaving absolutely distinctive tasks to grasp and learn, these appearances aremisleading. The choice that we must make in each situation is in fact verysimple and can be reduced to this: we must stand in the other person’s shoes andput other people’s needs and feelings ahead of our own desires. After all, ifeverything is a dream and everyone else is us, it makes perfect sense to loveeveryone as we love ourselves. All mainstream religions tell us that God is love—and anyone can turn the baddream into a good one by becoming a conduit of love, by giving love to everyone,without expecting anything in return. Mystics tell us that anyone who choosessuch a path will quickly notice major changes in his or her life—perhaps evenwithin few months. One of the versions of the bodhisattva (a being striving forawakening) vow spells it out thus: When we understand that there is no final attainment, No ultimate answer or stopping place, When our mind is free of warring emotions and the belief in separateness, Then we will have no fear. No matter where we are on the bodhisattva path, whether we are just beginning orwe’ve practiced for years, we’re always stepping farther into groundlessness. Enlightenment is not the end of anything. Enlightenment, being completely awake, Is just the beginning of fully entering into the Unknown. May I be a guard for those who are protectorless, A guide for those who journey on the road; For those who wish to go across the water, May I be a boat, a raft, a bridge. May I be an isle for those who yearn for landfall, And a lamp for those who long for light; For those who need a resting place, a bed, For all who need a servant, may I be a slave. May I be the wishing jewel, the vase of plenty, A word of power, and the supreme remedy. May I be the trees of miracles, And for every being, the abundant cow. Like the great earth and the other elements, Enduring as the sky itself endures, For the boundless multitude of living beings, May I be the ground and vessel of their life. Thus, for every single thing that lives, In number like the boundless reaches of the sky, May I be their sustenance and nourishment Until they pass beyond the bounds of suffering.16[index_split_017.html#filepos879738] The Christian scriptures note the same concept in similar words. In the Gospelof Matthew 5:38–48, Jesus says: > You have heard that it was said, “Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.” But I> tell you, do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right> cheek, turn to him the other also. And if someone wants to sue you and take> your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. If someone forces you to go one> mile, go with him two miles. Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn> away from the one who wants to borrow from you. > You have heard that it was said, “Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.” But> I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you> may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil> and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. If you love> those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors> doing that? And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing more than> others? Do not even pagans do that? Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly> Father is perfect. We are all capable of uncovering the divine within each of us. It doesn’t matterhow we accomplish this: through hypnosis, meditation, or the use ofpsychedelics—though some paths are shorter than others. When we becomedisillusioned with our search for happiness in the outside world, we beginsearching for answers within, and that search is bound to be fruitful . . . andif we happen to encounter some aliens or visit distant planets in the process,so be it. THE GAME OF LIFE An old Jewish tale tells us that God loves stories and has a great sense ofhumor. I suspect he loves movies and games as well. What if our life is really avery realistic game, not unlike eXistenZ, with an unlimited number of levels?And what if there is really only one player? Is our life just a game that Godplays to entertain himself? What if our goal here is to gather all the clues andcomplete whatever moves us to the next level? It seems that the law of karma is an operational principle on the level we areexploring right now: if you kill someone in this lifetime, he or she will killyou in the next one (an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth). The sacredscriptures of all religions hint at the possibility of a next level—a place withmuch more freedom and unlimited happiness. Moreover, these holy books can beused as “cheat sheets” of sorts to give us clues and hints that suggest how toget to the next level. The level we are on right now has some built-in incentives to push usforward—we’ve already dawdled here too long. The prophecies of Nostradamus andothers tell us of impending cataclysms, the Mayan calendar comes to an end in2012, and many predict that a time of change is coming. We see our naturalenvironment deteriorating quickly—global warming is growing out of control,polar caps are melting before our eyes. Some predict that ocean levels may risevery quickly once average global temperatures reach a certain level—perhapsthey’ll rise as much as thirty to fifty feet a year, for a total of threehundred to five hundred feet, as suggested by Hank Wesselman in his bookSpiritwalker: Messages from the Future.17 [index_split_017.html#filepos880012] In his second book, entitled Your Immortal Reality, Gary Renard predicts thatseveral major cities in the United States (including New York and Los Angeles)and Europe may be targets for nuclear attack by terrorists within the next fiftyyears.18 [index_split_017.html#filepos880206] The world is not getting anysafer: our government is wasting billions of dollars on wars that a majority ofcitizens don’t support (for example, the war in Iraq and the “war on drugs”) andstill our children are not safe at school or on the street . . . How much longerwill we wait before we change our mind and move to the next level? The nextcan’t be much worse than the one we’re on right now. Indeed, it should be muchbetter.

The lack of anyprevious published human studies with 5-methoxy-DMT would have required years ofadditional animal toxicology testing. In addition, as with DMT, the previouslydiscussed salvinorin A (in Salvia divinorum) and ketamine also produce states ofconsciousness that seem to allow perception of strikingly real, nonordinaryrealities. If and when endogenous compounds with the properties of salvinorin orketamine are isolated from the human body, we will need to appropriately modifya model of our consensus reality derived solely from DMT.

Both are inherently related to theprinciples of “local realism” (discussed in the section titled “The End of LocalRealism and the Limits of Quantum Theory”) and lose significance in theinter-connectedness of the nonlocal realm. The uncertainty in the measurement ofquantum correlations and their psychological effects helps to clarify why somany eminent scientists are reluctant to accept the existence of hardlyreplicable paranormal events and mystical phenomena. The study of the mysticalexperience needs its own standards, similar to those already established inmeticulous contemplative techniques. *9 [index_split_011.html#filepos555654] Often, in New Age literature, theembedded consciousness in plant species is called deva (“shining one” inSanskrit). The term is used to describe a creative intelligence that fulfillssome sort of morphogenetic and organizational role. *10 [index_split_011.html#filepos565503] Filamental networks are the suggestedcandidates to serve as media for topological consciousness. For more on this,see the section The Matrix Revolution. *11 [index_split_012.html#filepos588124] Ramban also offers the interpretationthat the Nephilim were so called because they were the offspring of “the Sons ofGod” who were born to less-than-superior women and therefore were inferiorcompared to children born of Noah’s daughters. *12 [index_split_012.html#filepos635070] After Strassman "},{"pageContent":"Endnotes INTRODUCTION 1.
