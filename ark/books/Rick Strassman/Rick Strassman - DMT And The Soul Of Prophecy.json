Strassman accomplishes this tour de force by wiselyinverting the vector of the field of neurotheology to that of theoneurology.This book exemplifies rigorous science and keen historical analysis and is asignificant contribution to human welfare. A delight to read, a sparklingexercise in clarity.”LARRY DOSSEY, M.D., AUTHOR OF ONE MIND“This book is a revelation. Strassman has written a daring and remarkable bookthat connects contemporary psychedelic explorers with the roots of the Jewishprophetic tradition. Here is a book that shows us how this ancient model ofprophecy might provide an elegant and powerful language for the ennobling of ourjourney toward expanded consciousness.”RABBI SHEFA GOLD, AUTHOR OF THE MAGIC OF HEBREW CHANT“A very surprising and refreshing book. Strassman is unique and opens upcompletely new perspectives. I have learned a lot from this well-written book,and I am sure that other readers will do so too. Strassman took me far beyondfamiliar ways of thinking about the brain, minds, and interactions with nonhumanintelligences.”RUPERT SHELDRAKE, PH.D., AUTHOR OF SCIENCE SET FREE“As Rick Strassman’s extraordinary new book explains, the Hebrew prophetictradition provides an unexpectedly powerful lens for wrestling with the meaningof our psychedelic experiences. Strassman’s model of theoneurology provides theproper context for viewing the religious importance of our mystic visions.”ALEX GREY, ARTIST, AUTHOR, AND COFOUNDER OFCoSM, CHAPEL OF SACRED MIRRORS“This engagingly written book will be of interest to those with primary interestin religious experience as well as those with primary interest in psychedelicexperience and altered states of consciousness.”ROLAND R. GRIFFITHS, PH.D.,PROFESSOR OF PSYCHIATRY AND NEUROSCIENCE,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE“People interested in DMT, hallucinogens, spirituality, monotheistic religion,Buddhism, consciousness studies, and philosophy will find this book stimulating.I commend Strassman for his bold attempt to bridge science and religion, therebyrisking attack from both sides. This is the kind of book that will advanceknowledge . . . A deep and intense study outside the usual boundaries ofeducation.”JEREMY NARBY, PH.D., ANTHROPOLOGIST ANDAUTHOR OF THE COSMIC SERPENT“This book is deeply compelling, groundbreaking, thought provoking, andimportant. Rick Strassman set the bar very high with his brilliant DMT: TheSpirit Molecule, but DMT and the Soul of Prophecy comfortably surpasses it bytaking the work forward in exciting and unexpected directions. Highlyrecommended.”GRAHAM HANCOCK, AUTHOR OF FINGERPRINTS OF THE GODS“By utilizing the worldview of the medieval Jewish philosophers, Strassman haspresented this often emotionally laden and controversial subject in such arational and scientific manner that even the skeptic and agnostic among us willbe pleasantly surprised at how intriguing the confluence of God, the HebrewBible, and psychedelic endogenous DMT can be.”RABBI JOEL DAVID BAKST, AUTHOR OF THE JERUSALEM STONE OFCONSCIOUSNESS—DMT, KABBALAH & THE PINEAL GLAND“This is a brilliant, perceptive, and illuminating book. Strassman states thatthe best way to understand the DMT experience is to see how closely it followsthe experience of Old Testament prophets and vice versa. I was surprised to findout he was right.”JAMES FADIMAN, PH.D.,AUTHOR OF THE PSYCHEDELIC EXPLORER’S GUIDE“A stimulating work that, while controversial, will be of interest to studentsof the Bible and human thought.”RABBI NORMAN STRICKMAN, PH.D.,ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF JUDAIC STUDIES, TUORO COLLEGE“Dr. Strassman’s theoneurology theory is a coherent and successful undertakingby a uniquely qualified and situated medical researcher of altered states ofconsciousness.”ALEX S.

Ezekiel was among the exiles from Judea, theSouthern Kingdom of ancient Israel. He and his comrades were beginning aseventy-year sojourn in their conquerors’ homeland after their armies destroyedthe First (or Solomon’s) Temple and the rest of Jerusalem in 597 BCE. We knownothing about Ezekiel before his prophetic mission, a mission he carried outwith relentless passion. He both raged against his people for their role inJerusalem’s downfall as well as offered hope for a future redemption. The Bookof Ezekiel begins with this vision:A stormy wind was coming from the north, a great cloud with flashing fire and abrilliance surrounding it . . . and from its midst, a semblance of fourChayot.*3 [part0037.html#ft3]. . . And as for the appearance of the Chayot,their appearance was like fiery coals, burning like the appearance of torches. .. . There was a brilliance to the fire, and from the fire went forth lightning.. . . Then I heard the sound of their wings like the sound of great waters . . .the sound of the words like the sound of a company. . . . I fell upon my faceand I heard a voice speaking, . . . “Son of man, stand on your feet and I willspeak to you.” (Ezek. 1:1–2:1)†4 [part0037.html#ft4]Nearly 2,500 years later and halfway around the world, I injected Leo,‡5[part0037.html#ft5] a human research volunteer, with the powerful psychedelicdrug dimethyltryptamine, or DMT. The setting was the General Clinical ResearchCenter of the University of New Mexico Hospital in Albuquerque in what was thefirst new American human research with psychedelic drugs in a generation. I havepreviously written about this study in DMT: The Spirit Molecule.1[part0038.html#fn1] Hundreds of plants produce DMT. So does the human body. Thusit is an endogenous psychedelic substance, one that the body makes on its own.My long-standing interest in the biology of spiritual experience had finallyculminated in this project studying the effects of DMT, effects I speculatedmight resemble naturally occurring spiritual states of consciousness.Leo was a psychologist in his mid-thirties and reported the following to usafter the drug effects had worn off:Large crystalline prisms appeared, a wild display of lights shooting off intoall directions. . . . My body felt cool and light. Was I about to faint? . . .My mind was completely full of some sort of sound, like the aftereffects of alarge ringing bell. . . . Out of the raging colossal waterfall of flaming colorexpanding into my visual field, the roaring silence, and an unspeakable joy,they stepped, or rather, emerged. Welcoming, curious, they almost sang, . . .“Now do you see? Now do you see?” (DMT, 344)*6 [part0037.html#ft6]The similarities between the two men’s descriptions are striking: a “rush” ofwind or physical lightness, a mind-filling auditory experience, feelings sopowerful as to cause a falling down or near faint, and the appearance ofcreatures emerging out of an amorphous, intensely dynamic background ofpreternaturally bright, flashing, and flaming colors. Both sets of beings’spoken voices also possess a noteworthy authority and power.How are we to understand these impressive similarities? What do they mean? Whatare their implications, both theoretical and practical? Do Ezekiel’s and Leo’svisions consist of the same “stuff”? If so, what is it? And if not, how do theydiffer? And most important, what do their visions mean? What can we learn aboutourselves and about the natural, social, and spiritual worlds from theirexperiences?In formulating a set of answers to these and many other related questions in DMTand the Soul of Prophecy, I will present a new scientific model for spiritualexperience that bridges the Hebrew Bible and contemporary psychiatry. This modelis theoneurology, and it uses for a bridge a modern reinterpretation of medievalJewish metaphysics. A remarkable collection of medieval authors used thismetaphysical system to explain Hebrew Bible prophecy—the paradigmatic spiritualexperience of their time—taking into account both the science and theology oftheir day. It is a model that explains how God affects the world through thenatural laws of science. As interest in the biology of spirituality continues togrow and new research findings in the field emerge, reexamining the medievalJewish philosophers’ approach to spirituality seems especially timely because ofits synthesis of scientific and Western religious sensibilities.Theoneurology provides a counterpoint to the present research model ofneurotheology, which proposes that the brain generates spiritual experience.2[part0038.html#fn2] In contrast, the theoneurological approach asserts insteadthat the brain is the agent through which God communicates with humans. This newmodel incorporates the findings of contemporary brain science while providing amore expansive understanding of the organizing principles for which thoseobjective data provide evidence. Integrating theological notions into abiomedical model of spiritual experience also may provide meaning for suchexperiences beyond their solely adaptive biological or social consequences.The striking similarities that I will demonstrate between the prophetic and DMTstates suggest common underlying mechanisms, both biological and metaphysical.As these shared features and theoretical mechanisms become clearer, I begin tobuild a case for a contemporary renaissance of prophetic experience. Thisproject proposes combining the enduring teachings of the Hebrew Bible with thepowerful consciousness-altering effects of the psychedelic drugs.ORGANIZATION OF THIS BOOKIn Part I, I review my DMT research: its scientific and cultural contexts, whatled me to design the study and how I performed it, its results, the problemsthose results posed for my initial hypotheses, and how I began to search foradditional models to explain those findings. Concluding that DMT administrationled to an awareness of what we currently call spiritual levels of existence, Idecided to seek answers using spiritual models, taking my search outside ofconventional scientific ones. I then describe how I came to the Hebrew Bible’smodel of prophecy as a way to understand the DMT effect in ways not possiblewithin Buddhism or Latin American shamanism. Because I know so much more aboutBuddhism, I emphasize its strengths and weaknesses more than those of LatinAmerican shamanism in this and subsequent parts of the book.Part II introduces the structure and content of the Hebrew Bible and emphasizesits notions of God and of prophecy. Here I recruit the assistance of themedieval Jewish philosophers and introduce the reader to their metaphysicalmodels.Part III makes up the bulk of this project. In it I carefully compare andcontrast the DMT and prophetic states, using my bedside notes of volunteers’reports of their DMT sessions and the record of prophetic experiences in theHebrew Bible. I show that while the phenomenology of the two states isextraordinarily similar, major differences appear with respect to theinformation each state contains. The prophetic message is much richer and morehighly articulated, especially in the case of the canonical prophets.I then describe that prophetic message through which we learn certain thingsabout God and our relationship with the spiritual world. The Hebrew Bible alsoteaches guidelines for how to relate to each other and the natural world, andintroduces us to the enigmatic notions of the “end of days,” “world to come,”and “messiah.” In this section I also discuss the concept of false prophecy, onethat is extraordinarily relevant to the thesis of this book. That is, how do weknow if our or others’ experiences are “true” or “false,” deluded or insightful,useful or detrimental?Part IV addresses mechanisms of action; that is, explanations for how the DMTand prophetic states either resemble each other or do not. I propose that thoseresemblances and disparities reflect shared or disparate biological as well asmetaphysical processes underlying both states. In keeping with thetheoneurological emphasis in this book, I focus primarily on metaphysical modelsfor prophecy and then apply them to the DMT experience.Part V begins with the question of whether prophecy, as the Hebrew Bibleunderstands it, still exists. Critiquing the rabbinic notion of “the end ofprophecy” using our theoneurological model, I suggest how prophecy may or maynot be our birthright. If it is our birthright, then certain suggestions forfuture studies and practices logically follow from our knowledge of the relevantmetaphysical and biological mechanisms. If prophecy no longer exists, this doesnot prevent our working on becoming more qualified so as to increase thelikelihood of its occurrence in the future."},{"pageContent":"> PART I> > From Psychedelic Drugs to the Hebrew Bible"},{"pageContent":"1Setting the StageWhat is prophecy? And what are the psychedelic drugs? In this introductorychapter, I will lay the groundwork for the material that follows, ideas andinformation that will lead us on a journey taking in a vast religious,intellectual, and scientific landscape.PROPHECYThe Hebrew Bible, or the “Old Testament,” considers prophecy to be the highestspiritual experience humans may attain. In the prophetic state one communicateswith God or God’s angels, hears voices, sees visions, feels extraordinaryemotions and physical sensations, and receives novel and valuable insights of apersonal or collective nature. This definition of prophecy is much broader thanthe conventional one of foretelling or predicting. Prediction may occur inprophecy, but it doesn’t always or even frequently occur, and when it doesoccur, its accuracy often is uncertain. And one may accurately predict withouthaving recourse to prophecy.The Hebrew Bible is a prophetic text. It recounts innumerable prophetic episodesin dozens of biblical figures. Those who conveyed its legal, poetic, and wisdomcontent received this information while in a state of prophecy. Even the text’shistorical narratives, according to some, required a prophet to accuratelyrecord them. And those who redacted the text, the ancient sages of Israel,partook of prophecy-like states on a regular basis. The Hebrew Bible emergedfrom the mind of prophecy and therefore is a prophetic text.While the phenomenological characteristics of prophecy, including its visionsand voices, are extraordinarily compelling, they do not explain why the HebrewBible has exerted such an enduring and pervasive influence on civilization.Rather, the prophetic message is responsible. This message derives from God andserves God’s purposes, some of which we understand and some we don’t.Prophecy, or direct communication with God, began with the first humans, Adamand Eve, and a particular form of prophecy, what is called canonical prophecy,flourished during the monarchical era of Israel. This period began in theancient Kingdom of Israel in the mid-eleventh century BCE, a time and place inwhich the canonical prophets found worthy targets for their ethical and moralteachings in the corrupt royalty and in general society. These figures leftbehind books bearing their names: Isaiah, Ezekiel, Jeremiah, and others.According to the rabbinical authorities of the early common era, prophecy“ended” in the mid-fifth century BCE—the early period of the Second Temple inJerusalem. These clerical leaders made this declaration for a variety ofreasons, theological and political. However, prophecy appears to have continuedafter its supposed end, albeit no longer within the mainstream of normativeJudaism.PSYCHEDELIC DRUGSSince Ezekiel’s time, medical science has also ventured into the visionaryrealms, in this case through the effects of the psychedelic drugs. These uniquemind-altering compounds, of which LSD*7 [part0037.html#ft7] is the prototype,affect all facets of human consciousness in a relatively consistent manner. Theymodify perception, mood, thought processes, physical sensations, and will inways that strikingly parallel stories we encounter when reading the HebrewBible. One perceives visions and voices, experiences extreme emotions andsomatic sensations, and attains new insights into personal, social, andspiritual issues.To date, however, the aesthetic contents of the Western psychedelic drugexperience have had a much greater impact on our culture than the messageconveyed. We see abundant evidence of this influence in “psychedelic” art,music, and technology. As yet, however, no cogent Western model of “psychedelic”spirituality has emerged, particularly one incorporating traditional Westernreligious beliefs and practices.As with prophecy, the Western psychedelic drug experience burst into the largerculture and affected it in a highly public manner. These substances were theobject of a tremendous amount of medical-psychiatric research in the 1950s and1960s. In addition, millions of young people experienced their effects innon-research settings, settings that also were associated with major socialupheaval, including anti-government protests against the wars in Southeast Asiaand reexamination of fundamental sexual mores. Psychedelic drugs also seem tohave disappeared after declarations of their banishment by the authorities, inthis case the political and scientific rather than the clerical authorities, andlegitimate human studies ended with the enactment of legal restrictions in the1960s and 1970s. And in the final analogy to prophecy, the use of psychedelicdrugs continued playing an important role in our culture even after thisproclamation, albeit outside the mainstream scientific and public arena. Thatsituation is now changing with the resumption of medical research with thesedrugs. The psychedelic drug research renaissance now provides us with anopportunity to revisit critical elements related to both psychedelic drugs andthe religious experience.THE THEONEUROLOGICAL MODEL AND ITS IMPLICATIONSIn this book I present a new scientific model that joins the prophetic andpsychedelic experiences by proposing that their shared phenomenology reflectsshared mechanisms. These mechanisms of action—how experiences take place, or“how they work”—are biological and spiritual. Another way of phrasing this isthat the mechanisms are physical and metaphysical. The objective data aremanifestations of currently invisible metaphysical processes whose presence weinfer from the observable phenomena.I propose that the common biological denominator is the presence of elevatedlevels of DMT in the brains of individuals in both states. In prophecy, Ihypothesize that DMT levels rise endogenously, and this mediates certainfeatures of the experience. In my New Mexico research subjects, brain levels ofDMT rose because I injected into their bloodstream large doses of the purecompound.The common spiritual or metaphysical mechanisms involve what the medieval Jewishphilosophers refer to as the “faculties” of the mind. One of these is theimaginative faculty, in which emerge the phenomenological contents—visions,voices, emotions, and so forth—of the experience. This is prophecy’s form, or“body.” The other is the rational faculty, whereby one interprets andcommunicates the information those contents convey. This message is prophecy’sessential nature, its “soul.”This model also adds to the discussion the involvement of God, who is theultimate arbiter of whether someone attains prophecy. While one may possessthrough birth or training high-functioning rational and imaginative faculties,these only determine one’s qualifications for prophecy, not its attainment. Thismodel is theocentric inasmuch as God is the initiating and organizing principle,rather than brain anatomy and function assuming this role. It proposes thatchanges in brain function are the means by which God communicates with us,rather than proposing that changes in brain function create the impression ofsuch communication. It is a top-down rather than a bottom-up model.There are practical implications of a theoneurological understanding ofprophecy. These emerge from speculating how the prophetic and DMT states’resemblance to each other reflects similar mechanisms of action. 1. If the prophetic state possesses “psychedelic” features, the psychedelic drug experience may help facilitate one’s understanding of the prophetic text. One’s mind begins resembling that out of which the prophetic text, the Hebrew Bible, emerged. That mind is the mind of prophecy. 2. The Hebrew Bible’s prophetic tradition may help understand and guide the contemporary Western psychedelic drug experience. Knowledge of the Hebrew Bible’s message, one consisting of specific terms, concepts, and narratives, may provide a novel, while at the same time traditional, Western religious cognitive matrix within which to understand and apply the spiritual properties of the psychedelic experience.*8 [part0037.html#ft8]WHY A NEW MODEL?I began my psychedelic drug research in 1990 hypothesizing that DMTadministration would occasion states of consciousness with spiritualcharacteristics. If the effects of exogenous DMT replicated features ofnon-drug-induced spiritual experience, this would be consistent with a role forelevated endogenous DMT in these non-drug states. While contemporarypsychopharmacological research models informed the design of my project, I alsobrought to it a specific spiritual orientation that had grown out of decades oflay Zen Buddhist study and practice. However, at the end of my research in 1995,I concluded that neither psychopharmacology nor Buddhism provided an adequatemodel for my volunteers’ experiences.Two features of the DMT state were responsible for this lack. One was theoverwhelming and unshakeable sense of the reality of those experiences. Takingthis conviction at face value is inconsistent with Buddhism’s and brainsciences’ belief that their nature is wholly illusory, or hallucinatory. Theother was the highly interactive and relational quality of volunteers’experiences. This contrasted with the unitive nature of Zen enlightenment, inwhich one’s individuality drops away in a concept-free and imageless state. Ithus began searching for alternative scientific and religious models, and thissearch ultimately led me to the Hebrew Bible and its notion of prophecy.Twenty years ago, if someone had suggested turning to the Hebrew Bible for amodel for the DMT experience, I would have been highly skeptical. Decades hadpassed since I had engaged with the Jewish tradition. More relevant, I had neverconsidered the Hebrew Bible a source of insight into spiritual states ingeneral, and certainly not into the psychedelic drug effect in particular.However, in seeking the best possible interpretation and application of myfindings, the words of two of my original DMT mentors continually pushed metoward whatever direction seemed most promising.Daniel X. Freedman, M.D., one of the fathers of modern American psychiatry,questioned the relevance of psychedelic drug research using the refrain “If so,so what?”1 [part0038.html#fn3] What does the psychedelic experience mean? Whyshould these drugs’ effects concern us? What are they good for? The other mentorwas Willis Harman, Ph.D., an engineer by training as well as a seminal figure inthe use of LSD for enhancing creativity.2 [part0038.html#fn4] Indirectlyproviding some exegesis*9 [part0037.html#ft9] to Dr. Freedman’s cryptic mantra,he challenged me one day on a fateful walk along the central California coast byasserting: “At the very least, we must enlarge the discussion aboutpsychedelics.” While neither suggested looking at Hebrew Bible prophecy to helpexplicate the psychedelic drug experience,†10 [part0037.html#ft10] rememberingtheir challenging words of encouragement inspired me to embark on and persist inthis project.WHAT THIS BOOK DOES NOT PROPOSEI wish to forestall several misunderstandings that might arise from what youhave so far read. First, I am not claiming that Hebrew Bible figures experiencedprophecy by ingesting psychedelic plants or drugs. There is little, if any,evidence in the text for this idea. More important, the presence of endogenouspsychedelics such as DMT, ones that the body makes on its own, militates againstthe necessity of demonstrating the use of exogenous substances.Second, I am not a DMT zealot, declaring that “endogenous DMT alone causesprophecy.” I have chosen DMT as my model compound because we know more about itseffects and biological mechanisms than about any other endogenous psychedelicsubstance. The state it occasions does share many features with the propheticone. However, as we will see, the fit is not perfect with respect to the twostates’ phenomenology, and is rather poor when it comes to their messagecontent. In addition, no data yet exist regarding endogenous DMT activity innon-drug-induced altered mental states such as dreams, near-death, or any typeof spiritual experience, let alone prophecy. Finally, DMT, or any otherendogenous or exogenous agent, does not “cause” prophecy. It may be one of theelements involved in God communicating with humans but is no more the cause ofprophecy than the television set is the “cause” of the content of a televisionshow. That content originates outside of the physical device and is thus ahigher-order phenomenon.THE RISKS AND BENEFITS OF AMATEUR HEBREW BIBLE SCHOLARSHIPThis book lacks the imprimatur that would attach to it if I possessed formalacademic or theological training in biblical studies. Even with such training,the vastness of the field of prophecy would have precluded my attaining anywherenear the mastery of the literature that I had obtained regarding the psychedelicdrugs when I wrote DMT: The Spirit Molecule. However, I have dedicated myself toan ever-deepening, mostly self-directed, course of Hebrew Bible study since1998, and I believe I have learned enough to begin sharing some of my findingsand conclusions.My status as a Hebrew Bible studies amateur, pursuing the field for love and notfor money or institutional fealty, provides certain advantages that wereunavailable while writing DMT: The Spirit Molecule. Here, I may speculate morefreely, because I am not adhering to any particular institution’s ororganization’s credo. While I attempted to distinguish between fact andconjecture in DMT: The Spirit Molecule, my scientific credentials andaffiliations led a significant number of readers to assume the factual nature ofmany speculative ideas.*11 [part0037.html#ft11] I hope my unaffiliated andnon-credentialed status makes this less likely here.THE CONTROVERSIAL NATURE OF THIS PROJECTDMT and the Soul of Prophecy represents a departure from the clinical andresearch communities I have inhabited for many years. It also enters into afield—biblical studies—that receives little consideration and not a littleantagonism from scientific and medical colleagues. Therefore, it is with someanxiety that I await responses from the scientific and medical communitiesoutside of whose objective rigor I now stand some distance and from thebiblically oriented spiritual communities, from whom I have had no formaltraining and with whom I have neither affiliation nor allegiance. Paradoxically,straddling both worlds has made it easier for me to attempt to resolve apparentconflicts between theology and science. It has made it easier to emphasize andbuild upon commonalities in methods, observations, theories, and goals relevantto both.Nevertheless, the model I present is bound to raise objections from bothscientific and religious readers. A theoneurological model requires that we takeinto account the God of the Hebrew Bible, a God who uses the brain as an agentrather than a God produced as an epiphenomenon of brain physiology. The God ofthe Hebrew Bible is externally existent and essentially incomprehensible,possesses certain expectations for our beliefs and behaviors, and through theoperation of cause and effect metes out consequences for how we live our lives.This model at first blush may be unpalatable to a secular scientific audience.However, it may at the same time ease the dissonance that exists in the minds ofthose scientifically inclined individuals whose religious beliefs and practicesplay an important role in their personal lives. As such it may provide a greaterintegration of those beliefs into their scientific pursuits.Those with a primarily faith-based approach to the Hebrew Bible may chafe atwhat they consider a medicalization of a revered spiritual tradition. Perhapsthey will see my hypotheses interpreting away any validity to prophecy,inaccurately concluding that my model proposes: “It’s just your brain on DMT.”This is certainly not my intention, and in fact, my intention is nearly theopposite. I am attempting to explicate how God and humans relate to each otherin the prophetic state at the interface of matter and spirit using the tools ofmetaphysics. This is far from saying that God is a phantom of our minds. Rather,God constituted our mind-brain complex so that we can communicate with thespiritual world, and DMT may be part of how that communication takes place.Therefore, I hope that those of a religious bent will find their faith evenstronger as a result of seriously considering the ideas in this book.I also anticipate resistance from some in the psychedelic subculture because ofmy emphasis on a Western religious tradition, which most have spurned. From itsinception, the psychedelic community has struggled to balance hedonism withidealism, and it appears to me that over the last several decades, hedonism hascome out ahead as the primary motivation to use these compounds. Among thosetaking psychedelic drugs for their spiritual properties, most are partial toEastern religious or Latin American shamanic models rather than Western biblicalones. There is strong resistance to the suggestion that the Hebrew Bible,particularly with its concept of God, might aid in the development of a cogentpsychedelic spirituality. I believe that here, too, just the opposite is thecase, and hope to use my extensive background in the psychedelic research fieldto buttress this notion.FOR WHOM THIS BOOK IS INTENDEDThe more overtly spiritual considerations I present in DMT and the Soul ofProphecy may lose some prospective readers who found DMT: The Spirit Molecule ofinterest. However, I wish to broaden this book’s appeal to additional readers.For example, prophecy attracts many people due to its relationship withprediction, particularly within the context of apocalyptic, messianic, orutopian “end of times” forecasting. Learning about the original broader meaningof prophecy and its deeper spiritual implications will enlarge these readers’appreciation of prophecy as more than simply divination or prognostication.The burgeoning field of neurotheology, and of scientific study of spiritualityin general, is making great strides in understanding biological concomitants ofreligious experience. At the same time, there exists a clear gap between thephysiology and the moral and ethical messages these states contain. Evolutionarybiology may provide one answer to “If so, so what?” That answer is: “Religiousexperience is good for you.” Here, the theoneurological model offersscientifically minded readers additional conceptual tools, ones that possess ahigher level of abstraction than is currently the case. It does this byanswering, “Prophecy is how God communicates with humans.” At the same time, itis absolutely consistent with the goals, methods, and findings of science.I am also addressing this book to those whose non-drug-induced visionaryexperiences have inspired them to find a suitable religious system outside ofthe Western mainstream. I receive many e-mails from such individuals, whodescribe experiencing DMT-like states without ever partaking of the drug, mostcommonly during meditation or dreamlike states at the borderlands ofwakefulness. Latin American shamanic and Eastern religious models address thesetypes of altered states directly, which is part of their appeal. The HebrewBible and its concept of prophecy may provide a useful alternative framework bywhich to understand these phenomena.While the psychedelic community may object to the God- and Hebrew Bible–orientedperspective of this book, they nevertheless are one of my target audiences. Thisgroup possesses a relatively inchoate and inarticulate view of these drugs’spiritual potential. Therefore, I wish to demonstrate to such prospectivereaders how the notion of Hebrew Bible prophecy, with its familiar vocabulary,concepts, and narratives, provides a viable, culturally and psychologicallycompatible alternative to Latin American shamanic and Eastern religious systems.New readers forming potentially the largest group are those interested in mydiscussion of Hebrew Bible prophecy in the context of a novel science-basedtheory of spirituality. Some new Jewish, Christian, and Muslim readers mayalready study and revere the text.*12 [part0037.html#ft12] They especially mayappreciate the extensive references to their sacred text and the discussion ofhow a theoneurological model sheds new light on prophetic experience. Others maywish to approach the material from the perspective of atheism, agnosticism, orsimply curiosity about a venerable religious experience that has exertedmillennia of profound influence throughout the world.Finally, I wish to introduce all my readers to the writings of the medievalJewish philosophers. This remarkable cadre of thinkers has shown me how to beginreconciling science and faith in a manner I previously had been completelyignorant of. If one simply gains an appreciation of these outstandingindividuals by virtue of reading this book, I will have accomplished a worthygoal.Sigmund Freud struggled to understand the Jewish religion and, in particular,the mind of Moses, its greatest prophet. The following excerpt from his Mosesand Monotheism resonated with my own anxieties about writing DMT and the Soul ofProphecy:At this point I expect to hear the reproach . . . that I have built up thisedifice of conjectures with too great a certainty, for which no adequate groundsare to be found in the material itself. I think this reproach would beunjustified. I’ve already stressed the element of doubt in the introduction, puta query in front of the brackets, so to speak, and can therefore save myself thetrouble of repeating it at each point inside the brackets. 4 [part0038.html#fn6]"},{"pageContent":"2Defining Our TermsHaving already introduced words such as consciousness, spiritual, religion, andso forth, I believe it is important at this early juncture to address theirdefinitions because many discussions of spiritual experiences quickly lose focusdue to disagreements regarding what we are in fact talking about. To assist mein this task, I reached for my dictionary early in this project.*13[part0037.html#ft13]CONSCIOUSNESSGeneral DefinitionConsciousness is the aggregate of the contents and processes of mental function,such as perception, mood, and thinking. It also refers to that which is aware ofsome object, impression, state, or influence. Thus awareness is a common synonymfor consciousness. The dictionary distinguishes between the two terms bysuggesting that awareness attends to something outside of oneself, whereasconsciousness attends to the inner working of one’s own mind.Altered States of ConsciousnessAn altered state of consciousness is a condition in which one or more of thefunctions or properties of consciousness, such as perception or sense of bodilyintegrity, differs from those that constitute “normal” consciousness. Thisbaseline reference state is awake and alert, the “normal waking state,” andallows us to know where we are, when our experience is taking place, and thedifference between our self and someone or something else. Examples of commonaltered states of consciousness are anesthesia, dreaming sleep, and alcoholintoxication.1 [part0038.html#fn7]SPIRITUALThe definition for spiritual encompasses a somewhat broader spectrum than thatof consciousness. Spiritual refers to anything, including thoughts, feelings, orimages, possessing the highest qualities of the human mind. Related terms areholy, sacred, religious, and pure. These words allude to the difference betweenthe spiritual and the everyday, bestial, or carnal. Spiritual may also refer tothings that are incorporeal, immaterial, or invisible. Those with a theologicalbent would include more specifically the immaterial nature of humans; that is,their soul or spirit. And even more specifically, spiritual may concern God,God’s spirit or word, or the soul upon which God acts.RELIGIONThe broadest definition of a religion is any system of faith, worship, beliefs,or practices that expresses the relationship between the spiritual nature ofhumans and the spiritual world. This relationship consists of a sense ofdependence and responsibility, as well as the feelings, ideas, and practicesnaturally flowing from those religious beliefs. A particular religion may be avessel for containing or channeling spiritual thoughts, feelings, imagery, andimpulses. However, spirituality can exist outside the boundaries of religiousinstitutions. This latter notion is usually what people mean when they say thatthey are “spiritual but not religious.”THEOLOGYTheology is the study of religion whose object is to synthesize a philosophy ofreligion. In a monotheistic context, it is a set of doctrines concerning God,God’s intermediaries, characteristics, and actions.METAPHYSICSI like to define metaphysics as the “science of the invisible,” although this israther idiosyncratic. A more formal definition is the science of firstprinciples of being and knowledge, or speculative philosophy in the widestsense. When set into a religious context, it shares many features with theology.SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES AND THEIR TYPESTaking into account these definitions of consciousness, spiritual, and religion,we have the necessary components with which to construct a definition ofspiritual experience. It is an altered state of consciousness with uniquespiritual characteristics. These characteristics include a sense of the statebeing unusual, rare, and valuable. It consists of images, thoughts, and feelingsthat one considers spiritual, undeniably distinct from everyday life.2[part0038.html#fn8]A religious experience is a type of spiritual experience occurring within thecontext of a religion. It partakes of imagery, vocabulary, and conceptsconsistent with that tradition.A mystical experience is a spiritual experience that possesses certainsubjective features. It may occur within or outside of a religious tradition.For the purposes of this book, I specify that it lacks imagery, concepts, andverbal content. In addition, one’s sense of self merges, unites, or “becomesone” with something “other.” That “other” is a spiritual thing such as God orthe spiritual essence of a natural or other phenomenon, like a beautifullandscape or music.Recognizing the unitive, or merging, characteristics of the mystical experienceallows us to consider “non-mystical” spiritual states, what I callinteractive-relational ones. The characteristics of the interactive-relationaltype include the maintenance of a sense of self, which allows one to distinguishand interact willfully with the contents of the experience, its images, ideas,and voices.I make the distinction between mystical-unitive and interactive-relational typesof spiritual states frequently throughout this book because much of contemporarymedical research in the field of spirituality takes as its default type themystical-unitive, rather than the interactive-relational.3 [part0038.html#fn9]As will become readily apparent, the prophetic state is interactive andrelational, never mystical nor unitive.Finally, a near-death experience is a spiritual experience occurring when one isnearly dead. It may be mystical-unitive, interactive-relational, or both, and itmay or may not contain a specific religion’s themes.ETHICS AND MORALITYIn this book, I raise the importance of the practical relevance of spiritualexperiences, both prophetic and psychedelic. One way we might address this issueconcerns changes in behavior and attitudes, the purview of ethics and morality.These two terms, ethics and morality, usually occur together, and I follow thisconvention to a large extent. Both refer to human character and behavior,especially with respect to principles of right and wrong. While it is difficultto draw a clear line between the two words, morality tends toward more personaland spiritual standards, whereas ethics refers to a social code of behavior. Forexample, there is a code of ethics for physicians and attorneys, but not a codeof morals. Morals, in this case, would refer to the guidelines for behavior andattitude that the individual attorney or physician would use to regulate his orher decisions at the personal, rather than professional, level. We mightconsider ethics as an individual or communal application of morality."},{"pageContent":"3The Path to DMTPsychedelic Drugs, Meditation, and the Pineal GlandThe notion of Hebrew Bible prophecy as a model for the DMT experience, and forthe Western psychedelic drug experience in general, started forming in my mindseveral years after completing my drug studies in the mid-1990s. That researchproject represented the culmination of a decades-long interest in the biology ofspiritual experience that began during my undergraduate training in the late1960s. In these next two chapters, I trace the impetus for my research; itsintellectual, biological, personal, and spiritual backdrops; the data that theproject generated; and how those data forced me to search outside my preexistingmodels for more adequate ones. That search ultimately led to the Hebrew Bibleand its notion of prophecy.ALTERED STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS: EAST MEETS WESTDuring the middle of the twentieth century, two powerful mind-alteringtechnologies burst upon the West. One came from the West itself and the otherfrom Asia. Both provided reliable and widely accessible methods for profoundlyaltering human consciousness. The Western side of this coin brought forth thepsychedelic drugs, especially LSD. The other produced Eastern meditationpractices, particularly those of Hinduism and Buddhism.*14 [part0037.html#ft14]Psychedelic DrugsThe term psychedelic means “mind-manifesting” or “mind-disclosing.” When itqualifies the word drug, it refers to a family of chemical compounds thatregularly occasion a unique constellation of psychological effects. Theseeffects include seeing visions; hearing voices and other information-bearingsounds; feeling intense emotions, both positive and negative; experiencingunusual thought processes and novel insights; and undergoing changes in thesense of self.Several other names exist for these substances, examples of which are LSD,mescaline from peyote cactus, psilocybin from “magic” mushrooms, and DMT. Thetraditional medical-legal term is hallucinogen, although this is overlyrestrictive because these drugs do not routinely cause hallucinations.Psychotomimetic (mimicking psychosis) inordinately emphasizes seriouspsychopathology and ignores these drugs’ reinforcing and sought-after qualities.We rarely encounter the term today. The more recent entheogen, meaning“generating divinity from within,” also is too exclusive for general use becauseit implies a belief in spirituality that not everyone shares, and it refers to aparticular type of experience that not everyone undergoes.I prefer the term psychedelic because it casts the widest possible net for therange of effects these substances elicit. They nearly invariably reveal to themind previously invisible processes and contents. At the same time, the termsubsumes the highly complex and variable responses they bring about, beatific orhorrific, insightful or confusing. While psychedelic has accumulated asignificant amount of cultural baggage from the divisive and chaotic 1960s, italso is the most flexible and inclusive term. For that reason, I have decided touse it, rather than pejorative or overly restrictive ones.*15[part0037.html#ft15]LSD originated in the modern European pharmaceutical laboratory in the 1940s2[part0038.html#fn11] and was one of the three legs of the scientific tripod uponwhich scientists erected the edifice of modern biological psychiatry, or humanpsychopharmacology, the preeminent model for understanding mental function andthe treatment of psychiatric disorders. Another leg of this tripod was thenearly simultaneous synthesis of the antipsychotic medication Thorazine(chlorpromazine). The third was the discovery of the presence and LSD-likeproperties of the neurotransmitter serotonin.†16 [part0037.html#ft16]Eastern MeditationAncient East Asian religious traditions were the source of the multitude ofmeditation techniques that flooded the West at nearly the same time as did thepsychedelic drugs. Hinduism and Buddhism had received some Western attentionduring the early 1900s; however, it was not until the psychedelic drugs hadunleashed a massive level of public interest in altered consciousness thatEastern religious meditation practices began assuming their current level ofpopularity. The Beatles initiated an interest in Transcendental Meditation, aHindu spiritual practice originating in India, after their “psychedelic” phase,and American West and East Coast academics and counter-cultural figures alsopopularized Buddhism, especially Japanese Zen Buddhism.It did not take long for similarities between descriptions of psychedelic drugeffects and those resulting from the practice of meditation to become apparent.For example, here are representative verses of an ancient Buddhist text:There were banners of precious stones, constantly emitting shining light andproducing beautiful sounds. . . . The finest jewels appeared spontaneously,raining inexhaustible quantities of gems and beautiful flowers all over theearth. There were rows of jewel trees, their branches and foliage lustrous andluxuriant. 3 [part0038.html#fn12]I found the psychedelic qualities of accounts of meditation such as theseintriguing and puzzled over their implications. I began considering howresemblances between the effects of psychedelic drugs and meditation mightreflect the action of common underlying biological mechanisms in both states.When the phenomenology of the two sets of subjective experiences resembled eachother, one could propose similar alterations in brain activity. This ideacontained practical applications as well. Did psychedelic drugs provide ashortcut to success in Buddhist meditation? Did Buddhist meditation represent anon-drug method for entering into psychedelic states?PERSONAL FACTORSWhile I was considering how to bridge psychedelic psychopharmacology and theeffects of Buddhist meditation, I decided to learn more about meditationfirsthand and explored various options before settling on Zen Buddhism. Up untilthen, my religious background consisted of a relatively ordinary Jewishupbringing within a Conservative Jewish*17 [part0037.html#ft17] household.During the six supplemental hours per week of Jewish education I received fromthe age of five to thirteen, we studied the Hebrew language; learned aboutJewish history, culture, and festivals; and read from the Hebrew Bible. However,we learned little about God other than His historical involvement with theJewish people over the millennia. Direct spiritual experience and the methods toattain it were not part of our curriculum. While Hebrew prayers were a largepart of the Saturday Sabbath synagogue service, their recitation seemed rote andpassionless. After my bar mitzvah at age thirteen, lacking any intellectual,emotional, or spiritual connection with Judaism, I drifted away from it.In addition to Buddhism’s entrance into popular culture, academic courses inBuddhist studies were just beginning to form when I was an undergraduatestudent. I was fortunate to be attending Stanford University at a time ofunprecedented growth in the scholarly study of Buddhism. The stimulus for thisgrowth was government funding for research attempting to explicate the role ofBuddhism in the Vietnam conflict. Highly publicized politically disruptive acts,such as self-immolation by protesting Buddhist monks, baffled the U.S.Department of State and the Department of Defense. As a result, money soon beganflowing to American universities to establish a Department of Buddhist Studiesto help the American government understand this mysterious religion. NancyLethcoe, a newly minted Doctor of Philosophy in Buddhist Studies, joined thefaculty at Stanford, and I took her class on Indian Buddhism in 1972.Buddhism intellectually and emotionally stirred me as very few things hadbefore. In addition, it represented a time-tested tradition that integrated andapplied highly altered states of consciousness into one’s life. To the extentthat meditational and psychedelic drug states resembled each other, one couldconsider Buddhism as a model for how to live a more consistently “psychedelic”everyday life.I was not alone in this belief. Countless Western men and women have begunBuddhist practice after first using psychedelic drugs.4 [part0038.html#fn13]Both psychedelic drugs and meditation elicit states of consciousness that pointtoward an enlightened state of mind: one in which time, space, and personalidentity do not exist; opposites reconcile seamlessly; and death no longer holdsany sting.*18 [part0037.html#ft18] The memory of and longing for that glimpse ofenlightenment pushes and draws them along the Buddhist path, a path seeminglyunavailable in their own culture.After learning Transcendental Meditation and visiting a number of Hindu andBuddhist centers in the United States, I began Buddhist practice within a Zen†19[part0037.html#ft19] order in my early twenties. I quickly found confirmationwithin that religious community of my ideas about the relationship betweenBuddhism and psychedelics. Among the dozens of its young members, nearlyeveryone had his or her first intimation of enlightenment‡20[part0037.html#ft20] during a psychedelic drug experience, usually with LSD.These monks and laypeople then found in Zen a model for living a spiritual lifethat was consistent with the insights they had obtained from their psychedelicdrug experiences.The Japanese term for the Zen meditation practice I learned is shikan taza,which roughly means “just sitting.” It involves directing attention to what istaking place both within one’s mind and body as well as in the external world inas continuous and focused a manner as possible. Deceptively simple, butdifficult in practice, the sustained and energetic application of this techniqueis capable of leading to a direct apprehension of the bases of experience, andultimately, of the nature of phenomenal existence itself. From this basicmeditation technique and resulting states of consciousness emerges all ofBuddhism.THE PINEAL GLAND AND CONSCIOUSNESSAfter establishing a meditation practice and finding a spiritual community withwhom I could study and train, I began accumulating information and formulatingideas within an academic context regarding the relationship between biology andspirituality. In doing so, I took a slightly different approach than scientistsat that time.Academic research into the biology of meditation in the 1960s and 1970s neverconsidered a possible role for endogenous psychedelic substances. Rather,researchers chose to examine less controversial topics, such as changes in brainwaves and indicators of stress, including adrenaline metabolism and bloodpressure.6 [part0038.html#fn15]Scientists who were examining the relationship between endogenous psychedelicsubstances and non-drug altered states similarly overlooked those resulting frommeditation. Instead, they focused on psychoses, in particular schizophrenia. Inboth the psychotic and psychedelic drug state, one hears and sees things thatothers do not, self- and body-image change radically, and thoughts lead tohighly unconventional and unshakeable conclusions. Researchers hypothesized thatdrugs blocking the effects of LSD might similarly block psychotic symptoms,based on the idea that the two syndromes reflected the workings of the samebiological processes. In other words, if there were an endogenous LSD-likesubstance causing psychosis, blocking LSD might block that endogenoussubstance’s psychotomimetic effects. Naturally, DMT dominated researchers’interest because it was the only known endogenous psychedelic whose biologicaland psychological effects had been characterized at the time.My approach instead was to consider the possibility that the body synthesized acompound with psychedelic properties that produced highly prized spiritualexperiences, rather than highly maladaptive psychotic experiences. And ratherthan proposing that meditation influenced brain waves or stress hormones thatwere relatively remote from the immediate subjective state, I wondered whether ahypothetical “spirit molecule” directly occasioned the meditational experiencesthemselves. In the same vein, it seemed possible that this compound mediated thesubjective elements of other nonpsychotic, non-drug-induced altered states suchas dream sleep and the effects of fasting and prayer.Where in the body might this spirit molecule arise? In my search for its originI was led to the pineal gland by another Stanford mentor, Jim Fadiman. Thepineal gland, a tiny organ sitting deep within the recesses of the human brain,has been for millennia an object of great interest to several systems of“esoteric physiology,” including Hinduism and Judaism. Even the rationalistDescartes referred to the pineal gland as the “seat of the soul,” the conduitbetween the human and spiritual worlds. Consistent with a role for the pinealgland in consciousness, its location in the brain is ideal for affecting visualand auditory pathways, as well as for releasing secretions into thecerebrospinal fluid that continually bathes the entire brain.*21[part0037.html#ft21] Most intriguing, I learned that the pineal gland containsthe precursors and enzymes necessary for the synthesis of endogenouspsychedelics such as 5-methoxy-DMT†22 [part0037.html#ft22] and DMT.‡23[part0037.html#ft23]Right after I completed my clinical and research training early in the 1980s, Iwas not in a position to embark directly on a human psychedelic drug study.Fortunately, at that time we understood very little about melatonin, the mostwell-known product of the pineal gland. Some research even alluded to itpossessing significant psychoactivity. Therefore, I decided to initiate mysearch for a biological basis of spiritual experience with the pineal gland andlaunched the most thorough investigation of melatonin’s effects in humans todate.At the end of this two-year project, we discovered relatively modestphysiological functions for melatonin, but no psychedelic effects, even atrather high doses. I needed to look elsewhere than melatonin in my search for anendogenous psychedelic substance. By this time I had established myself as asuccessful clinical research scientist and also had learned a great deal aboutprevious investigators’ findings regarding DMT. It seemed a good time to designand implement a study with this truly psychedelic endogenous compound.WHAT DMT ISDMT, or dimethyltryptamine, is the simplest “classical” psychedelic. This familyof compounds also includes LSD, psilocybin, and mescaline. While the duration oftheir effects differs, they all occasion similar subjective effects and sharenearly identical pharmacological properties. DMT is a strikingly small andsimple molecule. Its molecular weight, the sum of the weights of all itsindividual atoms, is only slightly greater than that of glucose, or blood sugar.DMT is the product of several biological modifications of dietary tryptophan,the same amino-acid building block with which melatonin and serotonin synthesisbegins. While scientists knew of DMT’s presence in psychedelic plants as earlyas the 1940s, it was not until the mid-1950s that we learned that DMT itself wasprofoundly psychedelic.8 [part0038.html#fn17]DMT is widespread throughout the plant kingdom. Hundreds, if not thousands, ofspecies possess it, a unique abundance of which exist in Latin America. Manyindigenous cultures in this region use DMT-containing plants for theirpsychedelic properties in healing, recreation, hunting, and spiritual practice.9[part0038.html#fn18] The increasingly popular Amazon psychedelic tea ayahuascacontains DMT as its visionary ingredient.*24 [part0037.html#ft24] DMT alsooccurs in every mammal that scientists have studied, including humans.10[part0038.html#fn19]The discovery of endogenous DMT in humans in the 1960s initiated a wave ofprovocative research attempting to determine an association between DMT andpsychotic illnesses like schizophrenia using the psychotomimetic model. Whileresults were inconclusive before the first wave of human research withpsychedelics ended in 1970, they did confirm DMT’s psychedelic properties andestablished that it was physically and psychologically safe when administered tohealthy volunteers.DMT possesses certain unique features among the psychedelics that make itparticularly intriguing. One is that it seems essential for normal brainfunction. I say this because of data indicating that DMT is one of the fewcompounds for which the brain will exert energy to get into its confines. Theblood-brain barrier prevents most endogenous and exogenous substances fromentering the brain from the bloodstream. However, compounds the brain requiresbut cannot synthesize on its own receive special treatment, such as glucose forfuel and certain amino acids for protein synthesis. DMT is another suchcompound.11 [part0038.html#fn20] If DMT were necessary for brain function, itwould explain this startling finding and suggest a critical role for DMT in theregulation of human consciousness.More recently, we have learned how mammals synthesize endogenous DMT, and itappears that lung tissue is the major site for its production in rabbits12[part0038.html#fn21] and humans.13 [part0038.html#fn22] Researchers haveidentified the gene responsible for the enzyme that finalizes DMT synthesis.After inserting the human gene into a virus and infecting mammalian cells withthat virus, those cells begin producing DMT.14 [part0038.html#fn23]Human research with DMT, and with all other psychedelic drugs, ceased with theenactment of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 in the United States andcomparable laws elsewhere.*25 [part0037.html#ft25] While scientists haddiscovered a highly promising avenue of inquiry, it had yet to attain the levelof maturity that comes from unrestricted study of the relevant phenomena. Forexample, scientists had not yet developed sensitive enough technology todetermine whether differences existed in DMT levels between normal and psychoticpeople. We knew nearly nothing about ayahuasca. And there was no considerationof the possible role of endogenous DMT in spiritual experience."},{"pageContent":"4The DMT WorldWhere Is This?In this chapter, I will review the DMT research that I performed at theUniversity of New Mexico in the 1990s. I will focus on the subjective effectsresulting from administering this endogenous psychedelic molecule to a group ofhuman volunteers, and note those effects that the models I had brought into mystudies failed to satisfactorily explain. It was these findings that prompted meto search for an alternative model that led to the Hebrew Bible’s notion ofprophecy.THE PROJECTThe DMT experiments took place in the General Clinical Research Center, afederally funded inpatient and outpatient facility of the University of NewMexico Hospital in Albuquerque. Because no human studies had occurred with thesedrugs in more than twenty years in the United States, the regulatory hurdleswere daunting and required two years to overcome. The study itself took placefrom 1990 to 1995. I received grants from federal, university, and privatesources, including the National Institutes of Health and the Scottish RiteSchizophrenia Research Program.My interest in the biology of spiritual experience was a significant motivationin performing this project. At the same time, I utilized conventionalpsychopharmacological methods that would help explicate the biological andpsychological effects of DMT. Animal research suggested that DMT modifiedserotonin function in the brain and elsewhere, so I measured in our humansubjects multiple serotonin-related physiological variables, such as bloodlevels of various hormones, blood pressure and heart rate, pupil diameter, andbody temperature.Ours were not typical normal volunteers. They all had previous experience withpsychedelic drugs, although not necessarily with DMT. There were several reasonsfor recruiting this type of research subject. I believed that informed consentwas possible only in those who knew from their own experience the nature ofpsychedelic drug effects. I thought that experienced subjects would be betterable to manage adverse psychological effects should they arise. They also wouldprovide more articulate and nuanced descriptions of responses to the drug thanwould psychedelic-naïve individuals, as well as be able to compare the DMT statewith that resulting from other psychedelic drugs. Many of our volunteers hadexperience with meditation and other spiritual practices and therefore couldcompare the effects of these mind-altering techniques with those of DMT.The DMT volunteers were high functioning, healthy, psychologicallysophisticated, and well educated. They hailed from the fields of medicine,psychology, media, software design, engineering, civil service, business, andeducation. In addition to satisfying their curiosity about DMT, altruism playeda role in their participation. They believed that psychedelic drugs werepotentially useful psychological or spiritual tools (or both) that deservedfurther research. They wished to contribute to expanding the frontiers ofknowledge regarding these drugs as well as the frontiers of consciousnessitself.Recreational users of DMT vaporize and then inhale it. This is what people meanwhen they refer to “smoking” DMT. This was impractical on our research unitbecause of the repulsive smell and potential lung problems. Previous humanstudies had used the intramuscular method of administration. However, the onesubject we gave DMT to by this route described its effects as slower and lessintense than those he had felt from vaporizing it several years before hevolunteered for our project. Because I wanted to replicate as closely aspossible the experience of recreational DMT use, I decided to give the drugintravenously (IV). In the handful of subjects who had previously smoked DMT,they confirmed that the IV route elicited a similar time course and level ofintensity of effects. During the five years of this research, I administeredmore than four hundred doses of DMT at varying strengths to nearly five dozenvolunteers.Each research subject received IV DMT while lying on a bed in a room in theresearch unit while a research nurse and I sat on either side of him or her.Sometimes a family member, friend, or invited guest(s) would join us. I preparedvolunteers for DMT’s effects during the preceding prolonged screening process,as well as on the morning of the session. I told them that DMT effects wouldbegin very rapidly, within a few heartbeats, peak at two to three minutes, andend within thirty minutes. During the session we would be checking bloodpressure regularly and drawing blood from an IV tube that the nurse hadpreviously placed in one of the volunteer’s forearm veins. The subject mostlikely would feel the mind separating from the body, and as a result, might fearthat he or she had died. I advised the volunteer to hold on to the thought thatthis was a drug effect, that there were no known deaths from DMT, and that aresuscitation team was on stand-by for any medical emergencies.Our method for supervising drug sessions partook of the “just sitting”meditation practice I described in the previous chapter. The nurse and I satsilently, directing attention outward toward the volunteer and the activities inthe room, as well as inward toward our own responses to what was taking place inthe suite. I chose this approach to provide an atmosphere in which subjects feltrelatively unburdened by any expectations other than to have an individualexperience and share it with us afterward. At the same time, we were able torespond to whatever needs arose in the session—providing physical andpsychological support, dealing with equipment malfunctions, and so on.In addition to informing our method of supervising sessions, Buddhistpsychological principles also helped me advise volunteers in contending withparticular obstacles during their DMT experiences. For example, if someone feltunable to move through the buzzing, swirling display of colors into a deeperlevel of the experience, I suggested meditation techniques such as shiftingattention toward other elements in the visual field.The “just sitting” method of supervising sessions shared features with Freudianpsychoanalytic “evenly-suspended attention.” This is a mental technique wherebythe therapist attends equally to and attempts to resonate with all aspects ofhis or her interactions with the patient. At the same time, the therapist isaware of his or her own psychological processes stimulated by this interaction.My own direct experience and study within a psychoanalytic framework, analogousto my firsthand knowledge of Zen Buddhism, helped inform our work in this regardas well. I had previously undertaken years of treatment as a patient in Freudianpsychoanalysis and this assisted me in empathizing with, understanding, andresponding to the highly regressed condition of our temporarily incapacitated,dependent, and helpless volunteers at the height of the drug effect. My academictraining in psychoanalytic psychotherapy also provided valuable skills for thiswork. Offering brief interpretive comments in response to psychologicalconflicts emerging in drug sessions often facilitated a more satisfactoryoutcome for the volunteer.PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTSDMT’s effects on serotonin-related systems were consistent with our hypotheses.We observed rapid and robust increases in blood levels of beta-endorphin,cortisol, prolactin, vasopressin, adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), andgrowth hormone.*26 [part0037.html#ft26] There was no effect on thyroidstimulating hormone, nor, interestingly, on melatonin. Heart rate, bloodpressure, pupil diameter, and body temperature also increased after DMTadministration.1 [part0038.html#fn24] Two volunteers experienced potentiallydangerous blood pressure responses, one high and one low, that resolved quicklywithout intervention and with no lingering aftereffects.SUBJECTIVE EFFECTSI assessed the subjective effects of DMT in two ways. First, we developed apencil-and-paper rating scale that volunteers filled out immediately after theirsessions. I drafted a preliminary form of this instrument after interviewingnearly twenty recreational users of DMT before we began the project, to get asense of what to expect from drug administration. We then used Buddhistpsychological and clinical psychiatric principles of mental function to parseresponses into several categories, such as perceptual alterations, emotionalresponses, and changes in thought processes.2 [part0038.html#fn25] This ratingscale generated numerical scores for subjects’ psychological responses toDMT.*27 [part0037.html#ft27]Second, I took detailed bedside notes during every drug session. Because DMT’seffects were so short, forty-five minutes or less, I was able to capture everydetail from the beginning to the end of volunteers’ experiences, as well as fromthe thirty- to sixty-minute discussions that came on the heels of the acute drugeffects. These records constitute about one thousand pages of notes and are thesource for the narrative material I used in DMT: The Spirit Molecule. They alsoprovide the subjective data I use in this book to compare the DMT and propheticstates.Below, I will present a general description of the DMT effect. In the chaptersthat follow in which I compare the prophetic and DMT states, I will provide manyexamples of specific effects.The “Rush”After receiving an intravenous injection of a psychedelic dose of DMT,*28[part0037.html#ft28] volunteers felt effects nearly instantly. These effectsquickly became so overwhelming as to completely replace previously ongoingsubjective experience. Responses to DMT were maximal at two to three minutes.Nearly every subject was unaware of the first blood pressure measurement, twominutes after the injection. This was all the more remarkable because themachine we used was rather noisy and exerted an uncomfortable squeezing of theupper arm. Subjects were usually only dimly aware of the second check at fiveminutes. The altered state began resolving at eight to ten minutes, and onecould begin speaking relatively normally by twenty to thirty minutes. Volunteersfelt back to “baseline” consciousness by thirty to forty-five minutes.An extraordinarily powerful “rush” filled the initial thirty to sixty seconds ofthe experience, a rapid and intense buildup of internal pressure and a startlingsense of acceleration. Visual coherence broke down, usually producing apixilated quality in the visual field. Intensely vibrating, rapidly morphinggeometric designs that exerted tremendous psychic force appeared whether eyeswere open or closed. Volunteers experienced unpleasant disorientation if theyopened their eyes at this point, trying to make sense of two simultaneous andoverlapping but categorically different levels of ongoing experience. We soonrequired that subjects wear black silk eyeshades during their sessions. Thisalso encouraged them to focus their awareness inward. At the climax of the rush,most volunteers felt a separation of their consciousness from their bodies, andthey found themselves occupying an incorporeal disembodied world.Physical SensationsThere was a sensation of physical lightness as the rush built in intensity.Within a minute, most volunteers felt that their consciousness had left theirbodies, moving in an upward and outward direction. Additional somatic effectsincluded shakiness, heart palpitations, feeling hot or cold, nausea, or sensinga crushing weight.EmotionsNearly all research subjects experienced some degree of psychological anxietyduring the rush. How well one managed this initial anxiety usually determinedthe overall quality of the session. Volunteers who had the most positiveresponses were those who could “let go” of this anxiety and trust thateverything was going to be all right. Those who found it difficult to rightthemselves if knocked off balance during the first few seconds—and were unableto quickly move through any fear, panic, or disorientation—usually found theirsessions unpleasant, perhaps even terrifying. That being said, the vast majoritydid pass through the rush with emotional equilibrium and then described anextraordinarily ecstatic, blissful state. Not infrequently, however, volunteersreported that the DMT state was relatively free of emotion.Auditory EffectsDuring the initial rush, subjects described a “wa-wa” oscillating sound or acrackling, crinkling noise similar to the crumpling of plastic wrap. At othertimes, the auditory effects were musical, “angelic,” or “heavenly.” Occasionallyvolunteers noticed cartoonlike “sproing” or “boing” sounds. While a volunteermay have perceived a spoken voice during later stages of the drug effect, thisnever happened during the initial rush. Later in the session, the location ofthe spoken voice was usually, but not always, inside the subject’s mind,something the “inner” rather than “outer” ears heard.Visual EffectsThe initial morphing, geometric kaleidoscopic visual responses to DMT usuallydeveloped into more recognizable, albeit often fantastic, imagery, such as starfields, planets, architecture, animals, plants, machines, or some combinationthereof. The intensity and saturation of the colors, their variegated hues, werefar beyond anything they had ever witnessed during normal waking consciousness,dreams, or even in response to other psychedelic drugs. In the majority ofcases, the visual contents of the experience morphed into “beings,” which I willdiscuss shortly.Cognitive EffectsDespite the overwhelming perceptual, physical, and emotional effects of DMT,volunteers reported relatively intact thinking processes. Most felt mentallyalert, were aware of their “surroundings” within the altered mental state, andremembered what occurred there in remarkable detail.Within this cognitive category resides what I refer to as a reality-appraisingfunction. This provided volunteers the ability to assess how “real” theexperience felt relative to normal waking and other states of consciousness.This function comprises several elements, including temporal continuity, stableself-image, perceptual solidity, and familiarity. It was striking how oftensubjects referred to the DMT state as being as real, or even more so, thaneveryday reality. In addition, they usually distinguished the DMT experiencefrom dreams and other psychedelic drugs’ effects. Many opined that it seemed asif DMT allowed them to perceive another world rather than that the druggenerated the perception of it.Volition, Will, and Self-ControlThe strength of the DMT experience nearly universally overpowered volunteers.However, once the initial shock subsided, most subjects were able to maintain asense of self-efficacy in the state. They could decide what to attend to, whatto ignore, and how to interact with the contents of their visions.BeingsMore than half of the DMT research subjects perceived what they described asliving and sentient “beings” in the DMT state with whom they interacted invarious ways.*29 [part0037.html#ft29] They were distinct figures possessingshape, color, movement, intelligence, and awareness of the volunteers,frequently expecting them. At other times, subjects did not directly see them,but heard them or felt their presence, or viewed their silhouetted or shadowedforms.The beings possessed specific features, such as emotion, color, shape, movement,and intelligence. They also elicited particular effects in the volunteers, suchas causing them to see images, feel emotions, or conceive thoughts. They werebusy, actively working on or doing things, sometimes to the volunteer or elsepursuing their own ends. The beings were powerful, often overwhelmingly so. Itwas their world, they were in charge, and while resistance was futile, it waspossible to negotiate with them as well as modify one’s reactions to them.Relational EffectsA category of the DMT effect that I did not especially attend to when analyzingthe volunteers’ reports before beginning work on this present book is that of“relatedness.” This property of the DMT experience pertains to the nature of theinteractions between the volunteer and the DMT world, in particular the beingsin that world. This element of the drug state only became clear once I hadprogressed rather far along in my comparison of the phenomenology of prophecyand the DMT effect. At a certain point, I realized that while a tremendousamount of overlap existed between the two sets of altered states, I sensed thatthey still differed in some essential manner. This difference was in the realmof relatedness. In retrospect, I believe my emphasis on eliciting theunitive-mystical state with DMT contributed to overlooking this importantfeature.The beings and the volunteers interacted with each other, engaging in arelationship within all the categories I have just reviewed: perceptual,physical, emotional, volitional, and cognitive. However, as my analysis of theprophetic state was maturing, it seemed that a new relational category wasimportant in characterizing both sets of experiences for two reasons. One wasthat it helped organize disparate solitary phenomena using a higher-order levelof abstraction. For example, the single relational property of “healing”subsumed an aggregate of emotional, somatic, and perceptual effects on thevolunteer. Individually analyzing each component didn’t adequately capture theessential feature of the exchange. Second, there were relational effects thatdidn’t neatly fit into any of the other categories; for example, arguing orguarding.Direct communication between the volunteer and beings occurred using the spokenword, telepathically mind to mind, or using visual symbols. Communication alsooccurred indirectly, in which case someone might overhear a conversation betweenbeings in the DMT world about him or her. There were times when difficultiesarose in understanding the medium of exchange, nearly always on the part of thevolunteer. The intent of communication was most often to impart information tothe research subject.THE MESSAGE AND MEANING OF THE DMT STATEThe consistent experiences of volunteers entering into a seemingly alternateuniverse, external to themselves, nearly instantly manifest after receiving aninjection of DMT and, at least as real as this reality, were undoubtedlyprofound and compelling. However, beyond its existence and qualities, what werethe volunteers learning there? Here they were less able to articulate the natureof the information the DMT state contained than they were able to characterizethe state itself; for example, its visual and auditory properties. Whendiscussing this informational content, subjects generally focused on personalissues. When they did describe more universal insights, lessons, or theological,moral, and ethical themes, they used the concepts and vocabulary they possessedregarding spiritual matters. These were usually New Age, Eastern religious,nature based, or scientific.I was surprised by the relative paucity of information that the DMT volunteersbrought back and the seemingly related lack of change resulting from theirparticipation in the study. While several factors contributed to the project’send,*30 [part0037.html#ft31] the absence of more profound insights or practicaleffects in the context of a relatively high-risk experimental setting playedimportant roles.I have since met with several former volunteers and have modified my conclusionsregarding the benefits of participation in the study. Some remarked that theirproblem-solving abilities had become more creative or that they felt a sense ofgreater altruism and less fear of death. They all noted that any long-termpositive sequelae such as career or lifestyle changes took years to manifest.Perhaps this slow and subtle process was the result of a “ceiling effect”related to volunteers’ high level of preexisting psychological health. Iintentionally chose stable and successful individuals who had alreadyestablished a mature relationship with their inner and outer worlds. There maynot have been much room to improve on a relatively successful life. In addition,my studies were not psychotherapeutic or spiritually oriented in either conceptor execution.I also wondered how much of this long incubation period resulted fromvolunteers’ and my difficulty recognizing and articulating the nature of theinformation that ultimately effected those personal changes. These cognitivefactors may have influenced how quickly or deeply any benefit the DMT stateconferred became evident. If volunteers had possessed a more sophisticatedvocabulary and concepts appropriate for the DMT experience, would that haveenriched their ability to mine more meaningful information from their sessions?Would these additional tools have made it easier for them to know what toexpect, recognize and interact with what they did encounter, and communicate andintegrate what they learned once returning to normal waking consciousness?DMT AND ENLIGHTENMENTI had hypothesized that if volunteers received a large enough dose of DMT, theywould undergo an enlightenment-like state, in which they totally identified andmerged with the undiluted essence of reality. In this condition there would beno form, feelings, concepts, sense of self, images, or physical sensations.However, those types of experiences were extraordinarily rare. Only one, perhapstwo, volunteers had what we might call a “typical” enlightenment experience.*31[part0037.html#ft32]The scarcity of enlightenment-like mystical-unitive states and the abundance ofinteractive-relational effects were major sources of perplexity for me. When Ibegan my studies, I believed that Buddhism was going to provide an ideal modelfor the highest state of consciousness one might attain on DMT. I had proposedthat DMT’s effects on brain chemistry were similar to those occurring during theZen enlightenment experience. When faced with the facts of my volunteers’reports being so different than those I expected, I felt my theoreticalframework begin to totter.WHERE IS THIS?Soon after beginning the DMT project, I found that my preconceptions regardingdrug effects impacted volunteers’ comfort in sharing with me what took placeduring their sessions. Implicit in all of my models—psychopharmacology, ZenBuddhism, and psychoanalytic psychology—was the belief in the essentialunreality of the DMT experience. It was “something else”; for example, brainchemistry changes, illusory and distracting brain-mind noise on the way towardthe ultimate goal of enlightenment, or symbolic representations of unconsciouswishes and conflicts. Any such approach dismissed one of the most significantfeatures of volunteers’ sessions: the DMT world’s sense of reality.Research subjects were already struggling with coming to terms with howshockingly real their experiences felt and how bizarre and unexpected they were.Any additional skepticism they sensed coming from me, despite my attempts atclinical and Zen neutrality, added to their discomfort. They gradually becamemore circumspect in describing all that they perceived, thought, and felt onDMT. I was losing access to the full range of the most interesting results ofthe project because of the constraints my theoretical models were imposing.In response, I decided to perform a “thought experiment.” I took at face valuethe claim of research subjects that they had indeed entered into a parallellevel of reality. Adopting this stance allowed me to regain access to uncensoredreports of the world my volunteers had just visited. I could postpone coming toany conclusions regarding the merits of this approach until I completed thestudies. Then I could consider more thoroughly how this might possibly be thecase and where to look for models that supported such conclusions. That is, ifthe DMT world were externally objective, what explanatory models were compatiblewith such a notion?GENERATING THE DMT WORLDWhen approaching the nature of the DMT experience, I began with the basics: DMTis a chemical substance that affects brain chemistry. These effects modify brainfunction, which in turn occasions the DMT experience. There are two ways toconceive of this “occasioning.” One is that the mind-brain complex under theinfluence of DMT generates these experiences. The other is that DMT affectsconsciousness in such a way that it is now capable of perceiving something realand external to us that it could not perceive before.The model that supposes that the brain on DMT generates the DMT world is what wemight call the “bottom-up” approach and is the province of neurotheology. Thisdiscipline addresses how observable changes in brain function are associatedwith spiritual experience. For example, when a practitioner of Western orEastern prayer or meditation enters into a state of consciousness he or shedescribes as spiritual, a researcher scans that person’s brain and compares thisscan with one taken in that same person during the normal waking state. Thisapproach has allowed scientists to establish correspondences between spiritualexperiences and alterations in the activity of particular brain areas.The neurotheological model proposes that spiritual practices activate an innateresponse or reflex that manifests as a unique subjective effect. The braingenerates these “spiritual” experiences when one of any number of appropriatestimuli activates this reflex. These stimuli may include prayer, fasting,sensory deprivation, or DMT injection. The material brain creates a spiritualexperience. This is a bottom-up approach.Neurotheology’s answer to why this reflex occurs is consistent with itsbiological philosophy. Spiritual experiences provide evolutionary advantages toindividuals, or to the groups to which they belong, who undergo them. Suchstates may enhance problem solving or lead to altruism. In this model, the“spiritual” in “spiritual experience” is an overlay, or epiphenomenon, thatculture has placed on a biological reflex that provides greater evolutionaryfitness.3 [part0038.html#fn26]PERCEIVING THE DMT WORLDI had immersed myself for five years in listening to DMT volunteers describe howreal their drug experiences felt. And with the goal in mind of attaining asthorough accounts as possible when interviewing subjects after their sessions, Ientertained the possibility that indeed they had entered into a parallel levelof reality. Later, when considering how their reports might actually bedescribing real external existents, I began building an alternative “top-down”model. This posited that the brain is not the source of spiritual experience,but is instead the organ by which volunteers apprehended*32 [part0037.html#ft33]a previously invisible level of existence that DMT-induced changes in brainchemistry made possible.This model proposes that the catalysts occasioning these states change brainfunction, which in turn affects consciousness. Consciousness, as ourapprehending faculty, now perceives things it could not before, comparable towhat occurs when we use any other technology, such as the microscope ortelescope. This then leads to our next question. Where might such previouslyinvisible levels of reality reside outside of our own minds? I began withanswers that contemporary science suggested.Modern physics hypothesizes that at least 90 percent of the universe’s massconsists of “dark matter” which neither generates nor reflects light; that is,it is invisible. Other theories speculate that an infinite number of “paralleluniverses” exist, each taking its origin from the present moment. Perhaps DMTallowed research subjects to perceive these alternate levels of reality usingthe mind-brain complex’s new receiving characteristics. These planes ofexistence might contain “beings” in the same manner that normal reality does.*33[part0037.html#ft34] The appeal of this notion is that it is scientificallytestable. Once we are able to capture images of what exists in the dark matteruniverse, for example, we would be able to confirm with our own eyes what theDMT subjects saw with their “inner” eyes.When considering whether this seemed to be a “truer” or “better” model than theneurotheological one, I found myself returning to Dr. Freedman’s naggingquestion: “If so, so what?” What if DMT makes it possible to peer intopreviously invisible levels of reality? What good comes from knowing this? Whattruths and benefits do we obtain that are inaccessible through simply using theneurotheological model?SCIENCE AND RELIGIONThe deeper understanding of the natural world that science provides does notnecessarily lead to either social or individual benefits. These benefits relateto how we use that new knowledge, applying ethical and moral guidelines. Whileit is possible that we might learn about new ways to generate energy, travelthrough space, and other technological advances, these are simply ways in whichwe’d become smarter, not wiser. Thus, while reflecting on the DMT volunteers’sessions, I decided that even a top-down “scientific” model didn’t provideenough guidance regarding the information that the DMT world contained. Nor, forthat matter, did it address the even more perplexing question of the ultimatebases and functions of those realms. What other models were available?The world’s great religious traditions also have occupied themselves forthousands of years with invisible worlds that humans perceive during spiritualexperiences. However, unlike science, they have tried to extract meaning fromthose states of consciousness in order to improve our lives. In particular, theyhave articulated guidelines regarding optimal relationships between the humanand invisible worlds, and within the visible world, both natural and social.There is no doubt that religious institutions for millennia have misused theauthority and power that spiritual experiences possess. At the same time, theyhave developed concepts and vocabularies relevant to these states that sciencehas yet to maturely formulate. Thus, in the spirit of “enlarging the discussion”about psychedelic drug states, I decided to remove one of my feet from theedifice of the natural sciences and place it onto that of religion.Biology, psychology, pharmacology, and physics were no longer my exclusivedefault modes when it came to explaining the “how?” “why?” “from where?” andother questions my DMT research raised. Rather, I would begin investigating themby using a spiritual mindset in addition to, not instead of, a scientific one.While taking such a position could turn out to be a slippery slope toward dogmaand fundamentalism, I was determined not to use either science or religion tonecessarily disprove the other. Instead, I wanted to see how both couldcontribute to providing the fullest possible explanation of the DMT effect."},{"pageContent":"5Candidate Religious SystemsWith the widespread non-research use of psychedelic drugs that began in the1960s, millions of young people have had spiritual experiences that probablywould never have otherwise occurred. They encountered previously invisiblerealities, experienced feelings of tremendous awe and reverence, and attainedwhat appeared to be profound insights into the nature of reality. Mainstreamtraditional Western religions were unprepared for this flood of spiritualexperience taking place outside their confines. Some young psychedelic drugusers found a home for the spiritual sensibilities that their psychedelic drugexperiences awakened in evangelical or monastic Christianity, or kabbalisticJudaism. Both these streams of Western religions explicitly incorporate alteredstates of consciousness as important tools for one’s spiritual development.However, many more have followed the 1960s’ meme of rejecting the familiar andturned instead to East Asian religions. As the passage of time has similarlyafflicted Buddhism with the “familiarity breeds contempt” syndrome, a newgeneration is turning to Latin American shamanism as a way to understand andintegrate the spiritual aspects of the psychedelic drug experience. Because I ammuch more familiar with Buddhism, especially Zen Buddhism, than shamanism, Iwill discuss the former to a much greater extent than the latter. Nevertheless,several of the issues I raise with respect to Buddhism also apply to shamanism.Some also turned to New Age philosophies. However, I have found that thesephilosophies are a moving target, malleable and ever- changing, and difficult toarticulate with anything near the rigor with which one can define Buddhism andLatin American shamanism. Since many New Age philosophies also borrow heavilyfrom Eastern religious and shamanic models, my comments about these latter twodisciplines are also applicable to many New Age beliefs and practices.BUDDHISM AND PSYCHEDELICSThe concepts and images that Buddhism uses to explicate the subjective effectsof meditation appeared extraordinarily relevant to the first generation ofpsychedelic drug-using youth. Overlapping phenomena included the “white light”of spiritual ecstasy; the non-identification of consciousness with the body; theexperience of past lives; the awareness of the immediacy and vastness of causeand effect; and insight into the nature, bases, and remedies for suffering.These are compelling facets of the psychedelic drug experience that Buddhismteaches are also accessible using meditation. In addition, Buddhism possessestime-tested and well-characterized teachings and lifestyles that support anddevelop what one might apprehend during these experiences.The 1964 publication of The Psychedelic Experience: A Manual Based on theTibetan Book of the Dead1 [part0038.html#fn27] suggests how compatibleBuddhism’s approach to highly altered states of consciousness seemed to be withthat of the psychedelic drug state. The Tibetan Book of the Dead is acenturies-old Buddhist meditation manual that practitioners use to help guidethe consciousness of dying individuals out of the body and through subsequentpost-death, non-corporeal states. The Harvard authors of the 1964 book believedthat these meditation practices would help in negotiating similar nonmaterialstates that one might encounter during psychedelic drug sessions. A more recentincarnation of this model is Krishna in the Sky with Diamonds,2[part0038.html#fn28] a psychedelic handbook using the foundational Hindu text,the Bhagavad Gita, for its spiritual moorings. The name of the book alludes tothe Beatles’ song “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,” whose initials are LSD.Different schools of Buddhism take widely divergent stances regarding the“psychedelic-like” phenomena resulting from meditation. I use the termpsychedelic-like in this context not to describe psychedelic drug use per se,but to refer to states of consciousness that share visual, emotional, somatic,and other features with those that such drugs may elicit. Some sects, forexample the Tibetan schools, practice “psychedelic” meditation techniques toattain enlightenment, whereas others, such as Zen, do not. To a large extent,the decision to work or dispense with these types of practices seems a matter ofpersonal preference, while the goal of enlightenment remains the same. And allbranches of Buddhism agree that the enlightened state possesses no images,forms, concepts, visions, feelings, or other discernible content.Buddhism and Invisible WorldsThe interpenetration of Buddhism and psychedelic drugs has had a determinativeeffect on how the West views the reality bases of the drug experience. Buddhistconcepts, at least as Asian and Western teachers present them to their Westernaudiences, are consistent with an essentially psychobiological/Freudian model.All these disciplines posit a generative role for the mind-brain complex inexplaining these phenomena. Buddhism’s contribution to this notion is to positthat the things one sees and hears during meditation are not “real,” but ratherproducts of consciousness, distracting detritus that the mind-brain complex isshedding as it moves toward the formless enlightened state.Note my qualifying the nature of the type of Buddhism that has made its way intothe West and promulgated these beliefs. Nearly all popular Buddhist teachers ofWesterners have been careful to purge the common belief among most AsianBuddhists, lay and monastic, that there indeed exist real, free-standing,external alternate levels of reality. To avoid alienating prospective students,they removed the “primitive” and “superstitious” elements of Buddhism that arecommon in the East.3 [part0038.html#fn29] Thus, they could demonstrate theostensible superiority of Buddhism relative to the “superstitious” Westernpopular religions with which their students were more familiar and had rejected.In the less abstract and intellectual forms of Buddhism, however, beings ofvarious types reside in parallel levels of reality and can harm or help someonein this world. The beings and the realms they inhabit are not products of themind. Rather, they reside in planes of existence that the mind can perceive andinteract with in a meditative state.As a result of this de-emphasis of the objective nature of invisible realitieswithin Buddhism, academics and counter-cultural figures who consciously orunconsciously rejected the notion of externally existent spiritual verities—inparticular an invisible God who communicates moral and ethical laws tohumanity—found in Buddhism an excellent model for explaining the psychedelicdrug effect. Such individuals could claim adherence to Buddhism, whiledisregarding much of what Buddhism really taught, in order to support their ownpreexisting biases. They could have their cake and eat it.These developments led to several outcomes under which we are still laboring.One is the assumption that what people experience during the psychedelic drugstate is fundamentally unreal rather than the perception of objective alternaterealties. In addition, the formless, content-free, wordless enlightenmentexperience became the benchmark by which one measured the spiritual experienceeither within a Western or Eastern religious tradition, or within the context ofthe psychedelic drug effect. Researchers and practitioners alike now interpretedthe “hallucinatory” elements with which one might interact and relate aslower-level way stations toward the “higher” mystical-unitive goal.Social or Individual Salvation in BuddhismSocial consequences also resulted from young Westerners adopting Buddhism as away to make sense of and apply psychedelic drug insights. These concernwithdrawal from the larger sociocultural sphere. One cannot overestimate theimpact of the assassinations of the Kennedys and of Martin Luther King, Jr., andthe killing of students at Kent State and Jackson State universities, on theutopian impulse that the psychedelic drug experience unleashed in the youthculture of the 1960s. The ferocity of the response of the “establishment” to the“counter-culture” caught the latter off-guard, forcing a radical reassessment ofthe relationship between drug-induced paradise and everyday reality.Buddhist teachings regarding the constructed, and therefore illusory, nature ofthat reality comported with similar insights one might attain during apsychedelic drug experience. Such notions provided a solution for many who foundthemselves lost in this conflict between the ideal and the actual. If reality isnot real, then why engage with it? Buddhism’s teaching about the constructednature of the self also provided solace. If there is no self, there is no one tofeel anguish and dissonance regarding the gap between inner ideals and theoutside world. Therefore, one’s distress is meaningless. The best option is todeconstruct the illusory self that is responsible for that distress.There is of course a very fine line between various types of renunciation, butthose subtleties eluded many young adults who fled to Eastern religious systemsin response to the suppression of civil disobedience and utopian idealism towhich the psychedelic drug experience led many. The result was an embracing of arelatively unengaged approach by young psychedelicists who believed that thiswas what Buddhism truly advocated. In a relatively guilt-free manner, one couldwithdraw from a world possessing no substance with which no individual selfinteracts.BUDDHISM AND THE DMT EXPERIENCESeveral factors led to extending my search beyond Buddhism for an optimalreligious model for the DMT effect. One was the nature of the DMT state itself,the data of volunteers’ reports, especially the rarity of classic Buddhistenlightenment experiences. This was the case even in those who practicedBuddhist and other forms of Eastern meditation and were hoping and expecting toattain this state.Another factor had to do with how Buddhism interpreted the DMT effect. The Zenmodel I brought to my research posited the fundamental unreality of subjects’experiences. As I previously noted, such an approach interfered withestablishing optimal rapport with volunteers when they recounted their sessionsto me. In fact, subjects’ stance regarding drug effects stood this notion on itshead.What I mean by this is that the highly articulated contents of the DMTexperience, its sights, sounds, feelings, and physical sensations, felt morereal than the highly articulated contents of everyday reality. Applying theyardstick of a unitive-mystical state was simply inapplicable. It wasirrelevant, one that the interactive-relational DMT state simply swept aside.The frame of reference for the DMT volunteers instead changed to that of aparallel level of reality that was at least as fulsome as this one, rather thanto a level of reality whose essential nature was empty of any contents.LATIN AMERICAN SHAMANISMShamanism, particularly the variety emerging from Amazonian ayahuasca-usingcultures, is gaining currency as another model through which to understand andapply psychedelic drug effects. There is considerable appeal to this movementwith respect to DMT because this compound is the visionary ingredient inayahuasca. My study of and participation in Latin American shamanism aresubstantially less than my experience with Buddhism. Nevertheless, since 1989 Ihave participated in numerous shamanic ceremonies, queried many Western andindigenous practitioners of ayahuasca shamanism, and studied the works of andcorresponded with published authorities.One of the most attractive aspects of Latin American shamanism is that itassumes the objective reality of the contents one apprehends in the alteredstates of consciousness into which their practices, including the use ofpsychedelic substances, lead. It thus comports with the DMT volunteers’experiences and their interpretation of them better than either apsychobiological or Buddhist model. As a corollary, shamanism has developed manytools for integrating and applying the contents of these states to normal wakingconsciousness.4 [part0038.html#fn30]However, other factors temper my enthusiasm for the Latin American shamanicmodel. For example, the ethics and morality of indigenous Amazonian shamans andtheir Western students are problematic. Violent, often murderous, competitionfor power, prestige, money, and sex is commonplace.5 [part0038.html#fn31]Western and Eastern religious organizations certainly have their share ofmoney-, weapons-, and sex-related scandals. Nonetheless, one would hope that anynew religious model for the psychedelic drug experience would be an advance, nota regression, in these critically important areas.CAVEATS COMMON TO BUDDHISM AND LATIN AMERICAN SHAMANISMBoth of these non-Western systems have built into them characteristics thatindicate their being less than optimal religious models for the spiritualproperties of the Western psychedelic drug experience. One is theological.Neither Buddhism nor indigenous shamanism are theocentric, positing God as thecreator and sustainer of the natural and spiritual worlds. Buddhism, at leastostensibly, teaches that belief in an external God is not conducive to the innerwork that one must engage in to attain the enlightened state. And shamanismemphasizes a multitude of invisible spiritual forces instead of God. I believethat in order for the psychedelic drug experience to exert the greatest possibleinfluence on Western religious sensibilities, it is advantageous to present andinterpret that experience in a manner consistent with religious notions alreadyexisting within those religions. The bedrock of all three major Westernreligions is the belief in God. Therefore, maintaining and building upon thatbelief seems more likely to be accepted than what might result from discardingit and substituting non-monotheistic beliefs.The situation is more complex in Buddhism, at least for the school in which Itrained. Both during ritual and everyday activities, we routinely prayed to theBuddha, bodhisattvas,*34 [part0037.html#ft35] and deceased teachers within ourlineage. We bowed to their photographs and statues. And our teacher taught thatBuddhism is not atheistic after all, but that one must search for references toGod in textual allusions. After some years the notion began pressing on me thatif I were to bow and pray to something or someone, I preferred that it be thehighest and most sublime “thing,” rather than a dead human or one of manyspiritual beings. And if Buddhism needed to cloak its belief in God, thereseemed to be an intellectual dishonesty underlying that decision.In a similar nontheist manner, shamanism emphasizes evoking and controllinginvisible spiritual forces of nature for healing, revenge, attracting a spouse,warfare, seeking lost items, and so forth. I again found myself chafing under amodel that prayed to spirits instead of their creator and sustainer: God. WhileChristian elements such as belief in God and Jesus are making increasing headwayinto Latin American shamanism, this is a relatively new phenomenon and is notintrinsic to it.6 [part0038.html#fn32]Neither Latin American shamanism nor Buddhism will be able to claim muchtheological allegiance from Westerners who either believe in, or refuse todisbelieve in, God. Western atheistic students of Buddhism or shamanism mayprefer interacting with the illusory nature of reality or a panoply of naturespirits than with their conflict-laden notion of God. However, the seeming lackof a recognizable God in both models is an obstacle to either of them providinga large-scale religious model for the contemporary Western psychedelic drugexperience.There are additional issues related to both Latin American shamanism’s andBuddhism’s “exoticism.” In neither history, culture, nor psychology arecontemporary Westerners creatures of the jungle or other non-literate indigenouscultures, at least not within the last several thousand years. Neither is theWest an Asian society with its emphasis on communality rather thanindividuality. I have therefore wondered if the fullness of the spiritualexperience a Western practitioner might have within either of these traditionsmay not be as great as it could be if more of those traditions’ elements werecongruent with Western personal and cultural backgrounds. In other words, theBuddhist notion of “emptiness” may mean something quite different to someonesteeped in generations of Asian culture and religion than to someone born andraised in a Western milieu. Their experience of emptiness would partake of theaccumulated experiences of millions of people over millennia with a depth andbreadth not possible in a relative newcomer to the concept.Buddhism’s novelty is no longer as great as it was when it first appeared in theWest, particularly as a model for the contemporary Western psychedelic drugeffect. I see examples of this in students of Buddhism with an interest inpsychedelic drugs now turning to shamanism with the hope that they may find aspiritual home there. However, it is unlikely that the current fascination withshamanism will prove much more enduring. Once we gain familiarity with either ofthese novel exotic systems, we will find the same personal and institutionalfoibles pervade them as any other.Therefore, as I reviewed the elements of the DMT experience and those of a moreideal religious system by which to understand and apply those effects, certainrequisite features became clear. 1. That system needed to posit the existence of free-standing, external levels of reality. 2. The contents with which one interacts and the information one brings back should stand at the summit, not the periphery, of that model’s foundational spiritual experience. 3. The framework ought to possess psychological, cultural, theological, moral, and ethical resonance with the Western mind."},{"pageContent":"> Part II> > The Hebrew Bible: Basic Notions"},{"pageContent":"6Introduction to the Hebrew BibleWhat It Is and How to Study ItDrink water from your own cistern, and flowing water from your own spring.PROVERBS 5:15After completing the DMT project, I began to read and then study the HebrewBible. This text drew my attention for personal and professional reasons, bothof which related to ending my association with the Zen Buddhist community I hadstudied and practiced with for more than two decades.*35 [part0037.html#ft36] Mygrowing dissatisfaction with Zen as a spiritual path played a role, as did theorganization’s reaction to an article I had written about the relationshipbetween Zen practice and psychedelic drug use.1 [part0038.html#fn33] However,most relevant for the purposes of this book is how my DMT data were notcomporting with the Buddhist model I had brought to bear on my research. Thesilver lining to an otherwise difficult set of circumstances was that I now feltfreer to explore other systems of religious thought for understanding theresults of my project.In this chapter, I begin making the case that the Hebrew Bible’s notion ofprophecy provides a viable alternative model to contemporary religious andscientific ones for understanding and applying the spiritual elements of thepsychedelic drug experience. While it may be unclear at first why I am providingas much detail as this chapter contains, I hope that as we progress through thismaterial, my decision becomes clearer. One of my goals for this book is to raiseinterest in the Hebrew Bible as a spiritual reference for such a model. Thiswill be easier to attain if I make it easier to enter into its world. Because somany secular, educated Westerners have only a smattering of knowledge of thetext, I believe a relatively thorough introduction like this one ultimately mayprove useful.A CHANCE ENCOUNTERIt was in a somewhat unsettled state that I found myself one day in 1998browsing through the bookshelves of Phoenix Rising, a locally owned bookstore inPort Townsend, Washington, where I was then living and working. My Zen communityand I had just parted ways, and other personal circumstances were just asvexing. I wistfully walked by row after row of books on Buddhism and Hinduism,realizing that Eastern religions and I had just about exhausted each other. Istopped in front of their almost embarrassingly modest “Judaism” section,curious as to what the West might offer. A slight, thin book with a brightturquoise cover stood out: The Kabbalah of Envy, by Nilton Bonder. I noticedwith surprise and some irony that the publisher was Shambhala, an imprintspecializing in Buddhism. Overcoming some instinctual and inchoate anxiety, Ibegan flipping through its pages and read this passage:Do not seek revenge. How to define “revenge”? Imagine that one person says toanother, “Lend me your sickle,” and the other denies the request. The next day,the latter says, “Lend me your chisel,”*36 [part0037.html#ft37] and the formerreplies that he will not lend the chisel, as the sickle was not lent to him.Such behavior is called revenge.2 [part0038.html#fn34]Do not bear a grudge. How to define a “grudge”? Imagine that one person says toanother, “Lend me your chisel,” and the latter refuses. The next day, the lattersays, “Lend me your sickle,” and the first replies, “Here it is. I am not likeyou, who would not lend me your chisel.” Such behavior is how grudges begin.3[part0038.html#fn35]This discussion occurs in the Talmud, a collection of legal, ethical, and moralteachings that the rabbis committed to writing in Israel and Babylonia duringthe first several centuries of the common era.4 [part0038.html#fn36] The passagepuzzled me. What significance did the ancient Jewish sages attribute to anargument over tools between two farmers? I was determined to understand how theydistinguished between revenge and a grudge, and why it mattered. After somereflection, I realized that this was a unique way to view our spiritual nature;that is, through social relationship and interaction. In the case of the twofarmers, the rabbis were demonstrating an understanding of anger that was highlysophisticated while at the same time highly practical. The perspective was vastbut the arena was intimate.Bonder’s analyses of the causes and effects of anger demonstrated that theyderive from, and extend to, a much larger arena than that of two people arguingover tools. If we are revengeful or bear a grudge, how does this impact ourrelationship with others and with ourselves? Our dealings with the market? Howdo grudges and revenge determine the relationships between a government and itspeople? Nations and other nations? Our relationship with the natural world? Withspiritual realities? Relationship, not transcendence or union, is the realm inwhich this type of spirituality manifests. In addition to sensing that thismodel opened a new door on my own spiritual path, I also felt a faint intimationthat its emphasis on relationship and interactions might provide a more resonantplatform upon which to build an understanding of the DMT effect. The DMT effectwas, after all, interactive and relational, not unitive and transcendent. Idecided to explore Bonder’s sources, and this led me to the Hebrew Bible.THE HEBREW BIBLE’S MODELThe previous chapter ended with my concluding that the psychological,biophysical, Buddhist, or shamanic models I had brought to my research, orstudied soon thereafter, did not satisfactorily account for all aspects of theDMT experience. They rejected the possibility that the contents of the DMTexperience were objectively real, did not sufficiently attend to the highlyinteractive nature of the state, suffered from ethical shortcomings, or lackedcultural compatibility.As I worked my way through the Hebrew Bible, the notion of prophecy began topress upon me. While its detailed characteristics were still vague, it clearlywas a form of spiritual experience replete with voices, visions, extremeemotional and physical effects, and novel insights. In these respects, itresonated with the DMT volunteers’ reports. Even more compelling was thatprophecy was interactive and relational. It was an exchange between humans and ausually invisible level of reality, one that is external, free-standing, andabsolutely objective, at least as real as everyday life. Angels withcharacteristics much like the DMT beings populated that world, as did God, whocreated and sustained that world as well as this one. Those beings and Godinteracted with humans and with each other in much the same way as the researchsubjects described their own interactions with beings, and beings’ interactionswith each other, in the DMT state.In addition, I felt myself “strangely at home” reading the Hebrew Bible. Whilethe details were abundantly unclear to me, the text’s figures and the narrativesinvolving them stirred a powerful sense of familiarity. Who among us is not atleast subliminally aware of Adam and Eve’s expulsion from the Garden of Eden,Noah and his family escaping the devastation of the flood in the ark, Abrahamnearly sacrificing his son Isaac, the twelve tribes of Israel and theirenslavement in Egypt, and the revelation of the Ten Commandments at Mount Sinaito Moses and the Hebrews? How many of our children are named after biblicalfigures: Aaron, Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, Moses, the angel Gabriel? Similarly, thecontents of the prophetic message resonated with me at an instinctual level: theGolden Rule, the messiah, creation from nothing, and the phrase “beating swordsinto plowshares.”WHAT IS THE HEBREW BIBLE?Once I began to form a notion of Hebrew biblical prophecy, the text’s power,popularity, and longevity started making sense. Its thousands of years ofworldwide influence are the result of it being a product of prophecy. It is aprophetic text. It articulates and thus potentially evokes a particular type ofspiritual experience: prophecy. The spirit of prophecy infuses the imagery andmessage of the Hebrew Bible. To the extent that spiritual experience isrewarding and inspiring, so is a text that captures and evokes its variousmanifestations.The Hebrew Bible (the Christian “Old Testament”) is the only Bible for Jews, whonumber approximately 6 million people, or 0.2 percent of the world’s population.In addition, the Hebrew Bible is the foundational scripture for more than halfof the world’s population. Two billion Christians conjoin it with their “NewTestament,” and Muslims, numbering another 1.5 billion people, regularly referto the Hebrew Bible in their holy book, the Qur’an.The adjective old qualifying testament, as in “Old Testament,” conjures upnotions such as outdated, archaic, obsolete, or no longer applicable. A moreaccurate term is Hebrew Bible, and I will use it here as do nearly allpresent-day scholars. The word Hebrew in this context refers to the HebrewBible’s language. It also refers to the people out of whose history and culturethe text emerged. The Hebrew people are a collection of closely relatedSemitic*37 [part0037.html#ft38] tribes who, after a time, began referring tothemselves as the “children,” “nation,” or “people” of Israel. The term Jew is arelatively late formulation, and first appears in the biblical Book of Esther as“Judean,” referring to the inhabitants of the land of Judea.†38[part0037.html#ft39]There are twenty-four books in the Hebrew Bible divided into three sections.These three are Torah, Prophets, and Writings. Often the Hebrew Bible isreferred to as the Tanakh,*39 [part0037.html#ft40] the acronym of the Hebrewwords for these three sections. The Torah consists of the Hebrew Bible’s firstfive books†40 [part0037.html#ft41] : Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, andDeuteronomy. The Torah begins with God creating “the heavens and the earth” andends with the death of Moses just before Joshua his heir leads the Hebrews intoCanaan. This latter episode took place at the end of a forty-year sojourn in thewilderness following the Hebrews’ exodus from centuries of Egyptian bondage. Inaddition to countless other narratives, the Torah describes Abraham’s initialprophetic encounter with God. Because Abraham is the first patriarch of Judaism,this spiritual experience marks the birth of the “Abrahamitic” religions:Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.The next section of the Hebrew Bible is Prophets. It records the annals of theHebrew nation, including the reigns of David and his son Solomon, after itsettled Canaan and ends with the construction of a new temple, the SecondTemple, in Jerusalem. This Second Temple was the crowning achievement of theJudeans who returned from a seventy-year exile in Babylonia. That exile beganwith the Babylonians razing the First Temple, or Solomon’s Temple, and theremainder of Jerusalem in 586 BCE. The books of the canonical prophets Isaiah,Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the twelve minor prophets‡41 [part0037.html#ft42] residein this section. The last part of the Hebrew Bible is Writings. These booksconsist of a mix of history, poetry, and wisdom and include, among others, Job,Psalms, Proverbs, Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes, and Daniel.AUTHORSHIP AND LANGUAGEThe present canon of the Hebrew Bible is the product of a compiling and editingprocess that took place from the fifth century BCE to thesecond century CE. Thetext’s language is nearly entirely Hebrew, except for a fraction in Aramaic,which is a closely related language that uses the same alphabet. Biblical Hebrewis a remarkable language. By using approximately two hundred three-letter roots,it is possible to generate an enormous lexicon by changing vowels or by adding aprefix and/or suffix to the root. For example, certain modifications of thethree-letter root for the verb “take” may result in one word meaning “by myhaving caused you to be taken.”The original text of the Hebrew Bible contained no vowels or punctuation. Thisleads to a highly dynamic and malleable interpretation of the text. Theresulting ambiguity has been a major factor in contributing to the enormousnumber of commentaries that generations of scholars have produced on the text.Consider the vowel-free three-letter English root t-l-l. Depending on theassociated vowels, the word might be “tell,” “tall,” “till,” “toll,” or “tally,”and the same word—toll, till, or tally—may be either a noun or a verb. Astandardized version of the Hebrew Bible containing vowels and punctuation didnot exist until the tenth century CE; this is the Masoretic Text. Otherreligions or sects rely on different independent translations of the originalHebrew, such as the Aramaic, Greek, Samaritan, German, Latin, and so on.Learning biblical Hebrew, while not practical for many of us, is the most directfirst step in attaining a deeper understanding of the Hebrew Bible. I beganrelearning this language so I could translate for myself what the original textwas saying.*42 [part0037.html#ft43] It is, at the same time, possible to reach aquite sophisticated level of comprehension using high quality Englishtranslations and commentaries.STUDYING THE HEBREW BIBLEDespite its great popularity, penetrating beyond a superficial understanding ofthe Hebrew Bible requires extraordinary effort. Much of this difficulty lies inunderstanding what it is actually saying; that is, the text requires guidance tointerpret. However, a significant contribution to many people’s problemsunderstanding the Hebrew Bible derives from powerful and unexamined emotionaland intellectual reactions to it. These responses may be to what the text saysor to how people have used it throughout history.The first chapter of the first book of the Hebrew Bible is Genesis’s narrativedetailing the creation of the heavens, the earth, and all their contents,including humans. It immediately forced upon me several questions: What is thisbook? Is it “true” or a “metaphor”? Or both? And does it matter? These questionswere identical to those that my DMT volunteers’ reports confronted me with. Weretheir experiences “real” or did they represent “something else”? And did itmatter?I knew that just as in the case with the DMT reports, how I viewed the contentsof the Hebrew Bible did matter. I would make little progress in learning what itsaid and meant if I treated its contents as simply metaphoric. Having learnedthe hard way from my drug research, I decided to engage in the same thoughtexperiment I had performed during the DMT study. I suspended disbelief anddecided that the world of the Hebrew Bible, for all I knew, was as real as thisone. I then could follow the various consequences of accepting the text at facevalue.Intellectual Issues and the Medieval Jewish PhilosophersMy primary guides in conducting this thought experiment have been the medievalJewish philosophers, who lived from the ninth to fourteenth centuries CE. Thesemen were all observant Jews, and nearly all were rabbis. They also were men ofletters: theologians, physicians, mathematicians, astronomers, astrologers,*43[part0037.html#ft44] and statesmen. The medieval Jewish philosophers assumed thereal, objective existence of the biblical world and its spiritual and materialconstituents. They then articulated its nature and rules in such a way as tomaintain a coherent and self-consistent whole whenever possible. Only rarely didthey resort to an allegorical interpretation of the text, and even then, theynever lost sight of the text’s plain or literal meaning.I include the Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza (also known as Benedict deSpinoza) in this group, although he differs in several respects from theclassical commentators. While he was born into a Jewish home and underwentrigorous religious training as a youth, in his adult years he was neitherobservant nor a rabbi.*44 [part0037.html#ft45] In addition, he lived severalhundred years after any of the other writers to which I refer. However, hisunique perspective on religion and science marked the formal end to a particular“medieval” style of thinking.5 [part0038.html#fn37] How he did this is of greatinterest because his work continues to exert an effect on our approach tobiblical, scientific, and religious issues.The preeminent medieval Jewish Bible commentators hailed from Babylonia, France,Spain, and Egypt. The earliest is Saadiah†45 [part0037.html#ft46] ben Joseph, orsimply Saadiah, who was active in the 900s. He was the head of one of the twomain Baghdad Jewish academies that the exiled Judean community had founded inBabylonia after the destruction of Jerusalem and the First Temple. Headjudicated cases originating in communities throughout all of Europe and theMiddle East. While he authored a Hebrew Bible commentary, his primarycontribution has been The Book of Beliefs and Opinions,6 [part0038.html#fn38]the first attempt to systematize a philosophy of the Hebrew Bible.The southern French rabbi and commentator Solomon ben Isaac, better known asRashi, lived from 1040 to 1104. His three daughters are the subjects of recentpopular novels.7 [part0038.html#fn39] Rashi wrote exhaustive and hugely popularcommentaries on the Hebrew Bible and the Talmud. The latter provided the firstreal entrée into this titanic, previously impenetrable corpus of rabbinicwritings. While he frequently adduced material from the Talmud and otherrabbinic texts instead of focusing on the plain meaning of the Hebrew Bible’sverses, Rashi’s thoroughness and popularity influenced my decision to make hiscommentary the first one I read from cover to cover.8 [part0038.html#fn40]The other commentators I have learned from originated from Spain, but at somepoint they all left their homeland, as religious persecution by local Muslimsand Christians was so unrelenting.Abraham ibn Ezra (1089–1167) is the least well known, and fittingly, the oneabout whom the most legends have sprung up. One tale relates that he was killedby a pack of black dogs that surrounded him on a road in the Englishcountryside. His wit and brilliant grammatical mind shine through his writings,and he takes no prisoners when disagreeing with someone else’s views, no matterhow esteemed his opponent. Despite astrology’s banned status within Judaism, ibnEzra supported himself with a busy astrological practice as well as from writingbiblical commentaries, his most renowned being that of the Torah.9[part0038.html#fn41] He also wrote a very useful summary of methods of HebrewBible interpretation and a guide to religious observance.10 [part0038.html#fn42]I have especially appreciated his spiritual approach to language, as forexample, when he remarks about words, that “in them, soul and body appear tounite.”*46 [part0037.html#ft47]Moses ben Nachman is better known as either Ramban or Nachmanides. He lived from1194 to 1270 and was the Jewish representative in a famous weeks-long“disputation” in front of the king of Spain in 1263.11 [part0038.html#fn43]Leader of Barcelona and greater Spanish Jewry, he had a fierce intellect andconvincingly defeated his Christian opponent. While the king acknowledged hisvictory, Nachmanides had to flee for his life and died soon after arriving inJerusalem. He is the first classical biblical commentator to explicitly refer tothe Kabbalah.12 [part0038.html#fn44] Most traditional Jews consider Rashi, ibnEzra, and Nachmanides to be the elite troika of the Torah commentators.Two other Spaniards did not write Bible commentaries but instead left behindmore systematic philosophical treatises, which have been essential to myunderstanding of the Hebrew Bible and its notion of prophecy. Judah Halevi(1085–1140) was a poet, physician, and perhaps ibn Ezra’s father-in-law. Hismajor philosophical work is The Kuzari.13 [part0038.html#fn45] This bookconsists of a fictional conversation between a rabbi and the king of theKhazars, an ancient Balkan people. In the king’s dream an angel informed himthat his thoughts were pleasing to God but not how he put them into practice.Seeking a better way to lead his life, he interviewed a philosopher, aChristian, a Muslim, and a Jew. He decided to study with his rabbinic mentor,who instructed him in Jewish beliefs, history, and the Hebrew language.Moses ben Maimon (1135–1204) is referred to as Maimonides, or Rambam, and livedmost of his adult life in the old section of Cairo. There he was the vizier’spersonal physician and the leader of the local and much of the internationalJewish community. His Guide of the Perplexed*47 [part0037.html#ft48] is anerudite and sophisticated attempt to bridge the world of the Hebrew Bible withthat of the Aristotelian science of his day.14 [part0038.html#fn46] Maimonidespossessed a unerringly focused mind and allegedly a photographic memory. Inaddition to writing the benchmark summary of Talmudic law, he also masteredmedicine and other secular disciplines: mathematics, natural science,philosophy, philology, and astronomy. Thus, he was able to accurately identifyand respond to objections from both science and fundamentalist Judaism to hisattempt to bridge faith and reason.Emotional IssuesWith effort I found I could overcome many of the intellectual obstacles that theHebrew Bible presents by studying the works of the medieval Jewish commentators.However, as I alluded to in my account of finding Bonder’s book in the PortTownsend bookshop, there are disconcerting emotional reactions to the HebrewBible as well. These may interfere even more with one’s ability to learn from itthan do the cognitive stumbling blocks. There were times I recoiled from certainelements in the text, or my knowing how others have misused those notions, andhad to ask myself: Is the Hebrew Bible an evil book? It certainly containsapparent examples of misogyny, homophobia, and calls to genocide. Several waysof dealing with these emotional responses have assisted me with overcoming theseobstacles.Gaining an intellectual understanding that a medieval Jewish philosopherprovides regarding a word or turn of phrase sometimes shed light on a viscerallydifficult passage. For example, we read that God commanded Adam and Eve to befruitful and multiply (Gen. 1:28). I immediately wondered if our adherence tothis command is why the human race is overrunning and wiping out the rest of theplanet. What kind of God would command something like that? However, ibn Ezrauses his understanding of Hebrew grammar to suggest that the statement is aprediction, rather than a command. And as I will describe later, predictionsoften are conditional. We can change our behavior to modify the conditions thatwould otherwise lead to a particular outcome. At other times, the commentators’historical perspective may help in contending with repellant laws. For example,they inform us that especially harsh punishments for seemingly mild infractionsnever took place; for example, in the case of a woman arousing her husband’sjealousy (Num. 5:11–31).Admittedly, certain admonitions defy anything but a literal interpretation, suchas killing men who engage in a homosexual act (Lev. 18:22). In these cases,after exhausting several attempts to accept these statements’ reasoning andseeking an explanation from the medieval commentators, I set aside my struggleagainst them in the interest of progressing through the text. Perhaps somethinglater on might shed light on such laws. In the meantime, I personally would notaccept their validity.Another approach to overcoming emotional resistances to studying the HebrewBible addresses the feelings directly. This is something one might do whenfacing any situation that stirs up painful emotions. Rather than simplyresponding by rejecting the text that arouses those feelings, we can investigatethem, trace their origins, and if possible, work through them by noting theirlack of relevance to our present adult lives. I found this especially usefulwhen reading about God’s “punishing” and “angry” characteristics, in which caseI noted how such descriptions triggered feelings about punishing and angrypeople from my childhood. While realizing I needed to understand what theseterms actually meant, I also gained some solace by recognizing that no one waspunishing me or was angry with me at the moment.THE HEBREW BIBLE AFFECTS OUR CONSCIOUSNESSI made an unexpected discovery once my intellectual and emotional resistances tostudying the Hebrew Bible began moderating. Sustained and intense involvementwith the text resulted in an altered state of consciousness. Attending to anyobject with prolonged and energetic focus is, after all, a type of meditationpractice. One effect of “meditating” on the text was that it became easier tounderstand. I was more relaxed and I could associate more readily to what it wassaying. This then fed back onto the altered state because the prophetic natureof the Hebrew Bible itself reflects the altered state of prophecy. Lessening myresistance to the text allowed it to exert its unique effects on my ownconsciousness. Identification with what I was reading increased, and I eitherunderstood, or could now defer outright rejection of, elements of the HebrewBible that I previously found impenetrable.This is comparable to the effects I noticed when I first began reading Buddhistscripture. The text reflects a state of mind, a particular type of spiritualexperience; in this case, the unitive enlightenment experience. The Hebrew Biblesimilarly articulates and evokes intimations of the interactive-relationalprophetic state.I found something similar occurring with prolonged immersion in the medievalJewish philosophers’ writings. In the early stages of my investigations, I foundtheir work more accessible than the Hebrew Bible itself, and I quickly learnedto trust their purity of intent and intellectual rigor when shifting between theHebrew Bible and their attempts to clarify its meaning. After their intellectualtools became part of my own repertoire, I felt more secure in navigating thetext without turning to them as often.Reading out loud at a normal conversational volume has also been effective ineliciting a mild altered state when reading the Hebrew Bible and itscommentaries. Doing this in Hebrew for the Bible itself is especially powerful,particularly in combination with a growing comprehension of the language.Besides the effects on consciousness, reading the text out loud also helps incomprehending it, providing a more lifelike quality to its record of the sights,sounds, ideas, and feelings it is documenting. It is like listening to someonetell a story while following a written version at the same time, rather thansimply reading it silently.OUR CONSCIOUSNESS AFFECTS OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE HEBREW BIBLEUsing meditation to facilitate “letting go” into the Hebrew Bible is notdissimilar to what I found helped volunteers enter into the DMT state. In bothcases, one willfully surrenders control to something that we believe isfundamentally safe and good. A preexisting meditative state, alert but notgrasping, helps reduce much of what occurs as we transition into either newworld: physical discomfort, anxiety, excitement, fear, and a confusing jumble ofthoughts. Awareness of breathing and posture makes prolonged focus lessdifficult, and training our attention to ignore distracting thoughts andperceptions can be very helpful. Once our reactions to the text lessen, it isbetter able to propel as well as guide our consciousness through its world. Andespecially in the beginning of one’s study, the medieval Jewish commentatorsassume the role of supervising one’s study sessions much as a trusted figureguides one’s psychedelic sessions. They ease our anxiety and explain what’staking place.Finally, judiciously entering into a “prophecy-like” state with thepharmacological assistance that psychedelic drugs provide may allow a greaterunderstanding of the text. Such would occur because of the resonance existingbetween the two states of consciousness: the one out of which the text emergedand that of the person now reading it. I discuss this suggestion in myconcluding chapters, where I offer practical applications that result from theproposal that the prophetic and DMT states share common features and underlyingmechanisms. I wish to introduce the idea here because it concerns therelationship of our consciousness to comprehending the Hebrew Bible.EXCURSUS: ANOTHER LOOK AT ADAM AND EVE IN THE GARDEN OF EDENOne of the earliest tales in the Hebrew Bible presents us with an opportunity todemonstrate how a mature investigation of a scriptural narrative provides afresh perspective on it. This concerns Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden inchapters 2 and 3 in Genesis. Many secularly educated Westerners mock the notionof a God who expelled Adam and Eve from the paradisiacal garden for eating “thefruit of the tree of knowledge.” This “proves” that the Hebrew Bible’s God ispetty, jealous, and vindictive. He wants humans to remain ignorant, and such aGod deserves our disparagement. While this conclusion seemed simple-minded to mebefore studying the narrative more closely, I didn’t know how else to interpretit. I admit to bracing myself and preparing to mount all manner of objections toGod’s behavior when I began studying this narrative. However, Maimonides’explanation provided me with an entirely new level of understanding of the taleand encouraged me to continue my studies using his and other commentators’ aid.The text explicitly states that the tree is not “of knowledge” but “of theknowledge of good and evil.” According to Maimonides, before eating the tree’sfruit Adam and Eve knew only truth and falsity, objective reality, things asthey are. After learning about good and evil, a subjective judgment rather thanobjective truth, their natures changed. They now inhabited the world ofopinions, value judgments, and relativity. This change made it impossible forthem to live in a world solely of objective truth. They no longer met thecriteria, so to speak, for living in the Garden. It was cause and effect; like,for example, becoming too tall to sit on a particular piece of furniture. In thecase of Adam and Eve, we see this as “punishment,” but that is only what we calla particular case of cause and effect. We wouldn’t consider the inability to siton the aforementioned piece of furniture to be “punishment.”"},{"pageContent":"7GodSome would deny any legitimate use of the word God because it has been misusedso much. Certainly it is the most burdened of all human words. Precisely forthat reason it is the most imperishable and unavoidable.MARTIN BUBER, I AND THOU, 123.One of the greatest stumbling blocks to any effort to plumb the Hebrew Bible isits notion of God. However, any discussion of a prophetic model for thepsychedelic drug experience cannot ignore this topic because God plays anecessary role in every element of prophecy. According to the Hebrew Bible, Godcreated and sustains the natural world, including our mind-brain complex throughwhich we experience prophecy. God created and sustains the spiritual world,which one apprehends in the prophetic state. Finally, God is the source, goal,explicator, and final arbiter of prophecy. It is because of this critical rolefor God in prophecy that I lay out in such detail the material this chaptercontains.I also wish to add a dimension to the understanding of the Hebrew Bible’s notionof God that may be unfamiliar to those who already possess some degree of beliefin, and love and knowledge of, God. This additional dimension consists of themetaphysics of the medieval Jewish philosophers, a system that uses the toolsand concepts of science to extract certain highly sophisticated principles aboutGod. These principles provide a significantly vaster view of God than a literalinterpretation of scripture might otherwise provide.Consistent with the worldview of the Hebrew Bible, I will be discussing God as a“real thing,” albeit a spiritual one, and not as an archaeological,psychological, cultural, or biological epiphenomenon. While the latterperspectives lend valuable insights into certain aspects of the concept of God,this chapter assumes the Bible’s default position: God exists as God and is notthe product of some other underlying process.The material in this chapter is rather dense, and I will not add to its densityby excessively excerpting biblical passages. In chapters 17 and 18, Message andMeaning I and II, I will quote more extensively from the Hebrew Bible in supportof particular notions regarding God’s nature and activities, ones that I firstintroduce here.While this chapter does not contain many excerpts from the Hebrew Bible, itnevertheless is where I begin to systematically introduce textual verses insupport of many of this book’s themes. Therefore this is a good place to commenton my English translations of Hebrew biblical verses.*48 [part0037.html#ft49]My references are Hebrew to English translations of the Hebrew Bible publishedby Judaica Press (New York, NY), ArtScroll/Mesorah (Brooklyn, NY), and theJewish Publication Society (Philadelphia, PA). ArtScroll/Mesorah1[part0038.html#fn47] and the Jewish Publication Society2 [part0038.html#fn48]have each issued a single-volume Hebrew Bible that contains all of itstwenty-four books. In addition, all three publishers have published multiplesingle-book volumes; e.g., Joshua, Song of Songs, and Ezekiel. More or lesssubtle differences exist in the Hebrew to English translations among this vastnumber of books, usually reflecting the theological biases of the publisher.When deciding the exact words to choose in presenting the English translationsthat appear here, I use my own understanding of biblical Hebrew while alsoconsidering the rationale each of the various editions uses in its decisionmaking. As a result, my translations may also slightly differ from those thatappear in any of the Jewish versions of the Hebrew Bible.A NOTE ON GOD’S PRONOUNIn earlier versions of this chapter, I experimented with changing God’sthird-person pronoun—what in English includes the words he, him, she, her, andit—from the traditional but sometimes problematic He and Him to the non-genderedIt. I did this to forestall negative reactions to the male gender connotationsthat a default masculine pronoun for God may elicit. At first, this change frommale-gendered to non-gendered made sense grammatically. There is no non-genderedthird-person pronoun it in the Hebrew language. Instead, there is only he andhim, and she and her, depending on the gender of the noun. For example, day inHebrew is a masculine noun. Any reference to day uses masculine forms of verbs,adjectives, and third-person pronouns. Thus, with respect to day, the Hebrewpronoun is the same word that one may translate as it or he. When translatingthe Hebrew into English, one naturally uses it, not he when referring to day.When speaking of a day’s brightness, we say its brightness, not his brightness.I similarly tried using It as a non-gendered third-person pronoun for Goddespite the fact that only the masculine third-person pronoun occurs in theHebrew Bible when referring to God. In addition to quelling objections bygender-sensitive readers, It also would sidestep the awkward He/She and Him/Heralternative to He and Him. Capitalizing It also provided the dignity that anypronoun of God calls for. I went so far as to change all English translations ofbiblical verses accordingly. However, further reflection led me to revert backto He and Him in nearly all instances.While the God of the Hebrew Bible possesses no physical gender, all biblicalreferences to God are in the masculine form. For example, the word for thesecond-person pronoun you differs in Hebrew depending on the subject’s gender.In all cases of God it is the masculine form of You. I also found only maleadjectives describing God. And the text only uses masculine images for God, suchas “king” but never “queen.”Nevertheless, there are instances in which He and Him simply feel toorestrictive. Thus, I use It when discussing certain of God’s attributes oractions, if doing so provides a more expansive appreciation for what the text isattempting to say. For example, the use of He when God speaks to humans, ratherthan It speaking, feels appropriate. However, It feels more appropriate whendiscussing something less “humanlike,” such as God’s omnipresence. Thus,translating the Hebrew verse as “It is everywhere” has the effect of enlargingthe notion of presence beyond what “He is everywhere” might otherwise convey.HOW I “FOUND” GODMy childhood education within the Conservative Jewish tradition did notexplicitly address God’s spiritual attributes nor cultivate a personalrelationship with Him. And while later studying and practicing within a ZenBuddhist setting, I rarely considered God. However, once I began to study theHebrew Bible and the medieval Jewish commentators, I could no longer set asidethe question of God’s existence. In addition, as God’s importance in prophecybecame increasingly clear, it led me to look more carefully at my bedside DMTnotes for volunteers’ references to God or “God-like” phenomena. I noted thatwhile these were not especially frequent, neither were they especially rare.I therefore saw the value of learning what the Hebrew Bible and its expositorstaught about God because this information would help me determine how resonantwere prophetic descriptions of It with those of the DMT volunteers. If the twosets of descriptions were similar, this would provide additional evidence insupport of my hypothesis that the prophetic and DMT states resembled each other.Early in my studies, I had to confront the most fundamental questions concerningGod. Does God exist? Is God real? I knew that learning about God would be easierif I accepted Its reality. I decided if I couldn’t flatly deny that God exists,I was free to engage in another thought experiment. If God were real, then whatwould It be? What would It be like, and what would It do? By what means would Itact?Reflecting on Buddhist teachings, I saw that the closest thing to God inBuddhism is cause and effect. Cause and effect are the bases of this reality.Things are what they are now because of what came before, and the presentdetermines what will take place in the future. Cause and effect underlie andperpetuate all of existence. In the notion of cause and effect, I sensed aconcept of God I could accept using these Buddhist ideas, ones with which I wasmore familiar at the time than those of the Hebrew Bible. Using cause and effectas a toehold, it was possible to posit God’s existence. Several avenues ofthought drew me to this conclusion.I had always wondered about the Buddhist proposition that cause and effect wereeternal. The process had never been, and would never be, nonexistent. ButBuddhism also taught that everything arises, exists, and finally passes away.What would “predate” cause and effect? And what would “exist” after it? Evenmore perplexing was considering what had created cause and effect in the firstplace and what sustains it. Positing God’s existence, Its reality, providedtentative answers to these questions. It is God who created and sustains causeand effect. God predates cause and effect and will exist after their extinction.These ideas are, in fact, one way to look at the theological notion of God’screating this world “from nothing.” Our minds cannot grasp existence withoutcause and effect. It doesn’t “exist” and is therefore “no-thing.”Buddhism also teaches that cause and effect are impersonal. However, they didnot seem entirely that way. If while hiking I stub my toe when feeling angry atsomeone, why does that happen? Unconscious psychological process might be atwork, but those processes simply describe how cause and effect affect thisparticular sphere. They explain how things that already exist operate, theirmechanisms, but not why they got that way in the first place. Why not get richas an immediate consequence of feeling anger? Or fly? There appeared to be asystem at work, one that seemed to discourage anger; in this case, by setting upa sequence of events leading to physical pain. This was another access point inmy approach to God. I could grasp the notion of a God who established the lawsof the moral universe as well as the physical one. Those moral laws reflectedGod’s desire, as it were, for how we live our lives.NAMES OF GODThe Hebrew Bible uses several names for God and chooses them carefully, as theyrefer to God’s different characteristics. The two most common are YHVH andElohim. These represent two polar notions of God and provide a useful foundationfor investigating God’s nature at greater depth.I raise the issue of God’s names as another example of how it may be helpful forsomeone who has experienced “God” in a psychedelic drug state to avail him- orherself of the Hebrew Bible’s concepts and vocabulary concerning prophecy. Mostof us habitually assign a number of unexamined and general qualities to “God”when we think about It. Learning about God’s various aspects, which Its namesconvey, may help someone become more discerning in their work with certain Godor God-like phenomena they encounter in the psychedelic drug state.YHVHThis is the Hebrew Bible’s unique name for God. God tells Moses and Isaiahrespectively about YHVH: This is My name eternally, and this is how to rememberMe (Exod. 3:15), and: I am YHVH; that is My name (Isa. 42:8). It appearsthousands of times in the text. It consists of four letters, thus the Greek termTetragrammaton, which means “four letters.” This is how the word YHVH looks whenwritten in Hebrew script, read from right to left:image [../images/00004.jpeg]where image [../images/00005.jpeg] is yud (y), image [../images/00006.jpeg] ishei (h), and image [../images/00007.jpeg] is vav (v, or silent if it carries thesound of an associated vowel). It is likely that the root of YHVH is H-V-H,which means “to be.”Traditional Judaism never pronounces this name, and it rarely appears withvowels in the vowelized Hebrew Bible. Non-Jewish religions have added vowels andpronounce the name Yahweh, Yehovah, or Jehovah. A common Jewish conventionrefers to YHVH as “the name,” or in Hebrew, HaShem. When reading from the Hebrewprayer book, the spoken pronunciation is Adonai, which means “my Lord.” The mostcommon translation of YHVH found in English translations of the Hebrew Bible is“the Lord.” In this book, I will use the written term YHVH.YHVH is the aspect of God that usually speaks with or appears to oneexperiencing prophecy. YHVH also receives the elaborate sacrificial service thatthe Hebrew Bible details. This fact prompted the medieval Jewish commentators tosuggest that YHVH represents God’s attribute of mercy. YHVH “bends” the laws ofcause and effect by “accepting” prayer or sacrifice, and thus mitigates thedetriment or magnifies the benefit to which a strict application of cause andeffect would otherwise lead.ElohimThe other name of God the Hebrew Bible uses thousands of times is the third wordthat appears in the first paragraph of Genesis: Elohim. This is God in Itsattribute of creator and sustainer of the heavens and the earth. The most commonEnglish translation of Elohim is “God.” Elohim and YHVH refer to the same God,as we note when Elohim tells Moses: I am YHVH (Exod. 6:2).Elohim derives from El, a word signifying strength, another name for God (Gen.31:13). Unlike YHVH, the Hebrew Bible uses the word elohim for things other thanGod; for example, idols, other nations’ “gods,” angels, spirits of the dead,judges, and powerful individuals. Except in some unusual circumstances, Itranslate the word as “God.”Here is how the word elohim appears in Hebrew:image [../images/00008.jpeg]From right to left the letters are aleph (silent, or taking the sound of theassociated vowel), lamed (l), hei (h), yud (y, or taking the associated vowel’ssound), and mem (m).Elohim refers to God’s power and efficacy in the world. It is the complement ofYHVH. While YHVH is merciful, we recognize Elohim by His manifesting strictjustice, immutable laws, inexorable cause and effect. The twelfth-centurySpaniard Judah Halevi suggests that Elohim is the impersonal name ofphilosophers’ and scientists’ God, whose existence we can infer by examining thenatural world, whereas YHVH represents God’s name relative to His will andpurpose as reflected in the “idiosyncratic” features of existence, why thingsare one way and not another.WHAT GOD IS NOT: ANTHROPOMORPHISMS AND HOMONYMOUS TERMSDespite the Hebrew Bible referring to God possessing certain characteristics,the medieval Jewish philosophers uniformly agree that God is not a materialobject nor does It reside in one, such as a star or statue. However, whenspeaking about God, we’re limited by language and need to start somewhere. Thisis where anthropomorphisms come into play. Anthropomorphisms are human qualitiesthat we apply to something nonhuman that help us understand certain ideas byusing familiar images; in this case, physical expressions for nonphysicalattributes. When the Bible states that God’s “outstretched arm” freed theHebrews from Egypt (Exod. 6:6), it does not mean that God possesses arms, butthat It has unlimited power to act in the world. Similarly, referring to God’s“eyes” means that It is aware of what is happening in the world, not that Itpossesses physical organs of sight with a retina, lens, and so on.Anthropopathisms are the psychological counterparts of this analogizing process.God is not like a human, who gets jealous or is merciful; rather, these arewords that the Hebrew Bible uses to describe the operation of a particular facetof cause and effect. Expressions that suggest God “loves” or “is angry” refer towhat we might imagine are the psychological preconditions or correlates thatresult in particular outcomes using a human frame of reference.We might believe God is “angry” when witnessing the catastrophic destruction ofan earthquake. However, that earthquake is the result of an incomprehensiblycomplex web of moral and natural cause and effect that God created and sustains,rather than the result of God’s “anger.” The moral element might be greed thatled to mining resources in a dangerous terrain, and the natural element is theresultant strain on the earth’s crust causing the seismic event. Thus, we seehow God set up cause and effect in such a way that encourages some anddiscourages other attitudes and behavior. Maimonides summarizes this idea byteaching that the Hebrew Bible expresses itself in terms that the majority ofpeople can understand. Since most of us only have a clear apprehension of thingsthat are similar to us, the text attributes to God physical and psychologicalattributes in order to convey certain ideas.Another factor in this discussion concerning “what God is” involves the largeridea of what the medieval Jewish commentators refer to as homonymous terms. Thisnotion extends the analogizing process to an even more fundamental level. Forexample, what does it mean when we say that God “exists”? God has never not beenin existence and will never not exist. These are properties that we cannotfathom. However, when positing God’s existence in the context of the universe aswe experience it, the medieval Jewish philosophers state that God exists, ratherthan saying It does not exist. In this case, “exists” only approximates the truesituation.Similarly, we say that God is “wise,” but God’s wisdom and ours differqualitatively. How can we relate to a wisdom that takes into account everypossible future outcome, everything transpiring in the present, and all eventsfrom the past? Nevertheless, calling God “wise” is better and more accurate thansaying that God is “ignorant.” Both exist and wise are examples of homonymousterms.Technically, a homonym is a word that is spelled and pronounced like anotherword but is different in meaning, like a dog’s bark and tree bark. Therefore,“homonym” is not a perfect rendition of the medieval Jewish philosophers’notion. Friedländer in his translation of Guide of the Perplexed refers to“homonymous” expressions or terms; that is, the words are “like homonyms.” Pinein his translation renders the idea as “amphibolous,” which emphasizes theambiguity of the terms involved. In the example of God “existing,” rigorouslyapplying the idea of a homonym would mean that God doesn’t really exist becausethe words have totally different meanings. But what the medieval Jewishphilosophers wish to impart is the notion that these terms are “nearly”unrelated because of how God’s existence differs from how we normally conceiveof existence.While on the subject of homonymity, let me briefly digress into a related issue.This concerns what God doesn’t do. God does not do the impossible; for example,causing the sum of the angles of a triangle in two-dimensional space to be otherthan 180 degrees. Doing the impossible makes no sense, it’s “non-sense.” If Godcould “do” the “impossible,” we would have to view both terms as homonymous,unlike how we currently understand them.INTERMEDIARIES AND ANGELSHow can an incorporeal God affect the corporeal world? The medieval Jewishphilosophers answered this question with the notion of intermediaries. This is aconcept they borrowed and modified from contemporary “neoplatonizedAristotelianism.”3 [part0038.html#fn49] Aristotle inferred the existence of Godas the “first cause,” who then created “separate intelligences,” what themedieval Jewish philosophers refer to as “angels.” These are intermediariesbetween an incorporeal God and a physical world.Medieval neoplatonized Aristotelianism held that different angels, or separateintelligences, regulate the functions, and are aware of the contents, of theirrespective “spheres” of the universe. These spheres contain celestial bodiessuch as constellations, stars, planets, and the moon. “Higher” spheres contain“lower” spheres and influence their contents and activities by means of thesynonymous terms: emanation, efflux, or overflow. Emanation is a “natural”process; that is, it occurs by virtue of the attributes of the emanating thing.It is a function of its existence. Just as the sun’s nature results in itradiating light, so does the nature of God and Its intermediaries result inemanation of their influence.The first level of overflow, or emanation, takes place between God and Itsclosest intermediary, and the last level occurs between the moon’s sphere andthe earth, the “sublunar” sphere. This last sphere is the domain of the ActiveIntellect, an externally existent storehouse of all natural, historical, andmoral information and laws affecting earthly life. While some medieval Jewishphilosophers posit that God’s influence directly emanates upon earthlyexistence, most suggest that this influence is indirect, through the aegis ofthe Active Intellect.I found myself attracted to this notion of intermediaries, as I sensed it couldhelp me with several aspects of the DMT state I was having trouble interpreting.One area concerned the beings. I was eager to see how the medieval Jewishphilosophers’ metaphysical understanding of intermediaries might shed light ontheir nature, location, and function.The beings as intermediaries also put into perspective one of the elements Ifound troubling in shamanism. Their placement in medieval metaphysics between usand God, rather than in place of God, provided a conceptual foundation fromwhich I could respond to what seemed to be shamanism’s misguided preoccupationwith spiritual forces. This distinction, as I was to learn later, is one of theways to avoid worshiping God’s creations rather than God Himself; that is,idolatry. The medieval Jewish philosophical notion of intermediaries alsobrought additional clarity to my discomfort with Buddhist views of the beings assimply products of our minds. While we perceive them in our minds, theirexistence is external to us.Finally, I liked how the idea of intermediaries added a spiritual level tophysical phenomena, seeing them as invisible Godly influences regulating andorganizing processes that otherwise seem inexplicable. While we may understandmechanisms underlying natural responses, say healing an infection, spiritualintermediaries are their nonphysical proximate cause. Healing occurs throughphysiological actions that we objectively may characterize and understand.However, according to the medievalists, these processes reflect the activity ofan invisible but inferred healing force that regulates the observable biologicalprocesses. In the case of healing, for example, this angel is Raphael, theEnglish translation of the Hebrew being “El (or God) heals.” This idea increasedmy appreciation and understanding of God’s nature. Why is there such a thing ashealing? Because God’s attributes of being “good,” “powerful,” and “wise”manifest by means of emanation via intermediates to direct the healing process.LEARNING ABOUT GOD’S NATUREWe can learn about God’s attributes in two ways: by studying nature and throughprophetic experience. Through reason, experiments, and deduction scienceindirectly demonstrates God’s wisdom and power, while prophecy may transmit thatinformation more directly and in terms more readily understood by the majorityof people. For example, both prophecy and science have arrived at the same“findings” of “creation from nothing” regarding the birth of the universe, onethrough revelation and the other through experimentation.THEODICYTheodicy means “justification of God,” as in someone justifying his or herbehavior that appears to be illegal or immoral. In this case, it refers to theproblem of reconciling the notion of a loving, powerful, omniscient, and fairGod with an obviously unfair world. If impartial “reward and punishment” are thenorm, why do evildoers prosper and good people suffer?The classic treatment of theodicy lies in the Book of Job, and I will provideseveral excerpts from it and other books in chapter 18, Message and Meaning II.The medieval Jewish philosophers have also strenuously exerted themselves inextracting satisfactory answers from the text. Ultimately, our authors see intheodicy the limits of human reasoning and not God’s limits. For example,Spinoza refutes the idea that there is any evil from God’s perspective, eventhough there may be from ours. And Maimonides points out that God did not createthe universe solely for humans.Nevertheless, the medieval Jewish philosophers offer possible explanations, mostof which propose that suffering takes place to bring about an ultimately greatergood; for example, pain resulting from curative surgery. Or we actually sufferless than that which might result from a strict application of cause and effect.An individual’s suffering may allow the species to survive. Undeserved sufferingmay even serve to increase one’s love of God, as in Job’s case. The other faceof theodicy is the success of the wicked, those who lie, cheat, steal, defame,hurt, and so on. One possible solution to this puzzle is that wicked people livea long life in order to give birth to a good child. Or they may have more timeto repent. Certain evildoers may end up being necessary to combat an evengreater evil.The notion of theodicy may seem rather removed from the DMT state. However, thereality of undeserved suffering as well as the success of wicked people aretopics that may occupy a significant part of anyone’s psychedelic experience.Thus, the Hebrew Bible may help us work through elements of a psychedelic drugsession using terms and concepts that otherwise would be unavailable."},{"pageContent":"8Prophet and ProphecyThe Biblical RecordIn this book, I define prophecy as any spiritual experience that the HebrewBible recounts. Prediction may occur, but isn’t an essential criterion. Inaddition to varying from its popular meaning as foretelling, my definition alsovaries somewhat from how most medieval Jewish philosophers use the term. Theyprimarily assign the experience to the canonical prophets, whereas my definitiontakes into account anyone undergoing contact with the spiritual world. Canonicalprophets are those whose names grace biblical books, such as Isaiah, Jeremiah,Ezekiel, Daniel, and Amos. They preached publically, and the words they andtheir heirs spoke constitute much of the prophetic message, which I detail inpart III. However, many other people in the Hebrew Bible beheld and communicatedwith God and angels but did not preach. These are the non-canonical prophets.Hebrew biblical prophecy stands on three pillars: the individual experiencingprophecy, the spiritual world that person encounters, and the process by whichcommunication takes place. The text explicitly details the first two of thesethree, while it simply assumes the existence of the third—that humans and thespiritual world interact. The medieval Jewish philosophers, on the other hand,occupy themselves with this third pillar, assuming the task of detailing themechanisms through which prophecy takes place.I have already presented a general overview of the Hebrew Bible’s notion of God,especially as the medieval Jewish philosophers have explicated it. In chapter19, The Metaphysics of Prophecy, and chapter 20, The Metaphysics of DMT, I willdiscuss biological and metaphysical mechanisms for prophecy in the context ofdeveloping my theoneurological model. In this chapter, I will explain how theHebrew Bible describes the person of the prophet, the experience of prophecyitself, and various conditions that may increase the likelihood of attaining thestate.This material also provides a Western religious context for the DMT experience.To the extent that prophecy and the DMT state share features, the Hebrew Biblemay provide valuable guidelines for those wishing to optimize the spiritualpotential of their work with psychedelic substances. By learning about the waythe text views the nature of prophecy, and who attains it and how, people mayuse this information to make their psychedelic experiences more “prophetic.”NAMES FOR SOMEONE EXPERIENCING PROPHECYThe Hebrew Bible uses several different words for the person of the prophet,each of which sheds light on important nuances and elements of its notion ofprophecy.NaviA common expression in the text for a prophet is navi, whose three-letter Hebrewroot is N-V-A. Words with the same root in related ancient Near Easternlanguages mean “to utter in a low voice or sound.” In biblical Hebrew,definitions of the root include “announce,” “acquaint,” “inform,” “makeintelligent,” “call,” “proclaim,” “name,” “speak,” and “interpret.” Otherpossible three-letter Hebrew roots from which the word navi may have emergedrefer to “bubbling forth,” or “to be high or elevated” in the sense of rankinghigh in esteem or being capable of accessing spiritual information.We gain insight into how the Hebrew Bible understands the function of a prophetin his or her role as navi when reading an exchange between Moses and God.During the vision of the burning bush (Exod. 3–4), God commissions Moses to leadthe enslaved Hebrew nation out of Egypt. However, Moses doesn’t feel hiscommunication skills are adequate to the task. To solve this, God assignsMoses’s older brother, Aaron, to be his spokesman (Exod. 7:1). God speaks toMoses, Moses tells Aaron what God said, and Aaron relays this information toPharaoh, the Egyptian king. God refers to Moses in this capacity as beingPharaoh’s elohim and to Aaron as Moses’s navi. God speaks to a navi, who speakson His behalf to one’s audience.The first translation of the Hebrew Bible was Greek and appeared around 250 BCE.It translates navi as prophÄ\"tÄ\"s. This word means one who speaks (phanai)before (pro) something happens; that is, one who predicts. The Greek’s emphasison foretelling as essential to the definition of a prophet is probably due totheir emphasizing divine inspiration’s role in prediction, a process theyreferred to as divination. Thus, the popular definition of prophecy resultedfrom a Greek interpretation of spirituality that affected the translation of aHebrew word whose basic meaning only peripherally subsumes foretelling. This isan example of how “all translations are commentaries,” whether we realize it ornot.ChozehAnother frequent term for prophet in the Hebrew Bible is chozeh.*49[part0037.html#ft50] Its three-letter Hebrew root is Ch-Z-H, which means “see,”“gaze at,” “behold,” “apprehend,” “perceive,” and “intuitively experience.” Theword first appears in reference to a prophet in the case of Nathan, King David’scourt prophet, who is “the navi, David’s chozeh” (2 Sam. 24:11).Chozeh may be the Hebrew Bible’s most poetic expression for a prophet. Adding analliterative touch, the Hebrew word for “window,” especially those inJerusalem’s First Temple, derives from the same root. The chozeh, as it were,possesses a window to spiritual worlds. Interestingly, the Hebrew Bible callsastrologers, whom it generally disparages, “chozim*50 [part0037.html#ft51] ofthe stars” (Isa. 47:13). Perhaps this points to the inspired nature of at leastsome types of astrology.Ro’ehThe most common translation in English-language Hebrew Bibles for the term ro’ehis “seer.” The Hebrew three-letter root R-A-H means “see,” “observe,” “look ator out for,” “view,” and “perceive.” Thus, ro’eh seems to emphasize a particularaspect of a prophet’s experience, the visual element. Another Hebrew word thatsounds exactly the same but whose spelling is slightly different means“shepherd.” This may refer to the role of the prophet in guiding the community.Samuel was the first of a particular type of prophet, one who played a majorrole in the political life of ancient Israel. He anointed the nation’s firstking, Saul, and then Saul’s usurper, David. Perhaps as an indication of hisliminal status, the Hebrew Bible calls him both a ro’eh (1 Chron. 9:22) and anavi (2 Chron. 35:18). This historical footnote indicates how Samuel ushered ina new type of prophet: He who is called the navi today was formerly called thero’eh (1 Sam. 9:9).We can therefore roughly differentiate the Hebrew Bible’s terms for prophet fromone another. The navi announces, communicates, or interprets; the chozeh is avisionary; while the ro’eh sees and discerns.The prophet’s intimate relationship with God is clear from additional terms suchas man of God (Jer. 35:4; Deut. 33:1; 2 Chron. 8:14), while God Himself callsthe prophets “My servants” (2 Kings 17:13). The Hebrew Bible refers to theSecond Temple prophets Haggai (Hag. 1:13) and Malachi (Mal. 3:1) as“messengers,” presumably God’s. It is worth noting that the Hebrew word formessenger also means “angel.” As I indicated in the last chapter, the medievalJewish philosophers describe how an angel is an intermediary allowing anon-corporeal God to interact with a physical world, a similar role to that of aprophet.While other terms for prophet appear in the text, they emphasize his or hersocial status, rather than a particular type of prophetic experience. Forexample, Ezekiel is a “sentinel” (Ezek. 3:17), and for the royalty the prophetis a “madman” (2 Kings 9:11).WORDS FOR PROPHECYMost often the text refers to prophecy itself, the experience of prophecy,simply as a “word,” as in “the word of God came to the prophet” (Jer. 1:4). Thisemphasizes the verbal, if not necessarily auditory, qualities of prophecy. Whenmore specialized terms appear, they derive from the same three-letter roots asdo the terms for prophet.With respect to Ch-Z-H-related words, the Hebrew Bible describes a prophetic“vision” (e.g., Obad. 1:1). The three-letter root R-A-H may refer to the notionof “semblance” of something in addition to its more usual sense of a vision. Inthe former case, Ezekiel describes the “semblance of the appearance” of spinningwheels in his vision (Ezek. 1:16). In the latter case, God makes Itself known toa prophet in a “vision” (Num. 12:6), and Samuel hears God’s voice in a “vision”(1 Sam. 3:15). Surprisingly, only rarely do we find expressions for prophecythat use the three-letter root of navi (2 Chron. 9:29).A NOTE ON THE BUDDHA AND ENLIGHTENMENTIn the spirit of continuing to make salient comparisons between the HebrewBible’s model of prophecy and those that are currently popular for understandingthe spiritual properties of the psychedelic drug experience, I will brieflycompare what we have so far discussed about prophecy with notions in Buddhism.The three most common terms for one who attains enlightenment in Buddhism arearhat, tathagata, and buddha. All refer to personal characteristics oraccomplishments, and none refers to mediating between the spiritual and thehuman spheres. For example, arhat refers to one who is either “worthy” or who“vanquishes affliction.” Tathagata refers to one who is “thus come and thusgone,” signifying a certain disengagement from the human condition. Buddha issomeone who is “awakened.”Similarly, the Buddhist terms for enlightenment—nirvana, samadhi, andanuttara-samyak-sambodhi—refer to its characteristically unitive, conceptless,and formless attributes. Nirvana is a state free of suffering, of perfect peace,and extinguishing of selfhood. Samadhi occurs when there is no differentiationbetween subject and object. Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi is an “unsurpassed, correctenlightenment” or “awakening.” None of these terms posits the apprehension of anexternal, free-standing level of reality, especially one allowing converse withan external God with whom one interacts at an immediate and intimate level.CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PROPHETOne may possess certain traits at birth or a status by inheritance that makesattaining prophecy more likely. The former include one’s intellectual andimaginative powers, while the latter may provide authority for mounting apulpit. In addition, one may seek prophecy through training, desire, andphysical or mental aids. However, no matter what one’s social rank, genetics, ortraining, the Hebrew Bible consistently states that the final arbiter in theprocess is God. Without God’s will, one cannot attain prophecy.In the Hebrew Bible, those who experience prophecy come from the entire spectrumof humanity. They usually are male but sometimes female.1 [part0038.html#fn50]There are occasional references to a prophet being the descendent of anotherprophet (1 Kings 16:1; Zech. 1:1). However, a genetic “predisposition” is noguarantee, as neither Moses’s nor Samuel’s sons were prophets.We glean little about physical requirements from the text. Saul, Israel’s firstking who experiences several episodes of prophecy, is the “tallest and mosthandsome man in Israel” (1 Sam. 9:2), and the prophet Daniel belongs to a groupof Hebrew youths: in whom there was no blemish, who were good-looking . . . andwho have the stamina to stand in the King’s palace (Dan. 1:4–5). At the sametime, we read about God’s assuaging Samuel’s anxiety about the future prophetDavid’s plain appearance: YHVH looks into the heart . . . and not his appearanceor tall stature (1 Sam. 16:7). Age doesn’t seem to matter either. Moses waseighty and his brother, Aaron, eighty-three when God first appeared to them withtheir prophetic missions (Exod. 7:7), while the text describes Samuel as a“youth” at the time of his initial theophany (1 Sam. 2:11).Social status varies widely. Sarah, Abraham’s wife, is unable to conceive formany years. As was customary, she encourages her husband to bear children withher maidservant, Hagar the Egyptian. As tensions rise, Sarah expels Hagar to thewilderness, and angels appear to the shamed foreign slave and advise her invarious ways (Gen. 16:7–12). Samson’s mother is seemingly so insignificant thatwe never learn her name, but she too encounters God’s angel twice (Judg.13:3–10). On the other side of the social spectrum is Solomon, David’s favoriteson and the most powerful king in Israel’s history (1 Kings 3:12). Intermediatebetween these two extremes are the figures in the Book of Judges, a large numberof ad hoc leaders in pre-monarchical ancient Israel. When a national crisisdevelops, God bestows prophecy upon these mostly unremarkable men and women tohelp lead the people both morally and militarily.TRAINING, DISCIPLESHIP, AND GUILDSThe Hebrew Bible describes what appear to be prophetic schools where theattendees are called the “children of prophets” (2 Kings 4:1), thus alluding tothe existence of formal training opportunities. Reference to large communitiesof prophets in Jerusalem similarly indicates the presence of professionalprophetic collectives (1 Kings 18:4).Joshua attended Moses for nearly forty years, thus seemingly becoming qualifiedto take the prophetic reins from his teacher after his death (Num. 27:18).Elisha, Elijah’s disciple, similarly asks for prophetic transmission before histeacher dies, and receives it (2 Kings 2:9, 15). However, discipleship is noguarantee of attaining prophecy. When Jeremiah’s longtime and faithful attendantBaruch complains about not experiencing prophecy, God tells Jeremiah to ask himrhetorically: Do you seek great things for yourself? (Jer. 45:5).TRANSFER OF PROPHECYThe Hebrew Bible narrates occasions of the transfer of prophecy from anestablished prophet to someone with no previous experience with the state. Mosestransfers some of his “splendor” to seventy elders in the wilderness, who thenprophesy (Num. 11:25). Elisha was a fierce and powerful prophet, whom manyfeared to even gaze upon. He “opens the eyes” of his attendant, thus causing himto see an army of fiery beings (2 Kings 6:17).HOW TO MAKE PROPHECY MORE LIKELYUsually prophecy comes upon the recipient through God’s aegis, rather than fromengaging in a particular practice or from external non-Godly influences.However, examples do appear of specific methods, techniques, or externalconditions that may contribute to initiating a prophetic state.Sensory Stimulation or DeprivationThe general fervor of large gatherings may conduce to prophetic experience, asin the case of an unknown individual who began to prophesy “in the midst of theassembly” (2 Chron. 20:14). And a band of prophets engaging in group ecstasy hasthis effect on Saul (1 Sam. 10:5–6, 10). Delicious food may stimulate prophecy.Isaac requests a meal of his favorite delicacies before predicting his sons’futures (Gen. 27:4). Music also may have this effect. Elisha requests a song:And it came to pass that as the musician played, the hand of YHVH came upon[Elisha] (2 Kings 3:15). Several of David’s colleagues prophesy with harps,lyres, and cymbals (1 Chron. 25:1).On the other hand, reducing sensory experience may help one attain prophecy. ANazirite abstains from wine and liquor during his periods of ascetic dedicationto God (Num. 6:2–3), presumably to enhance his closeness to the deity. BothMoses (Exod. 24:18; 34:28; Deut. 9:9, 11, 18, 25) and Elijah (1 Kings 19:8) fastfor prolonged periods on Mount Sinai, where each receives his theophany. Danielmourns for three weeks before a vision finally appears to him (Dan. 10:2).Sexual abstinence may enhance sensitivity to prophecy. God tells the Hebrews toavoid marital relations for three days in anticipation of the revelation atMount Sinai (Exod. 19:15). On the other hand, God commands Hosea—aneighth-century BCE Northern Kingdom prophet—to marry the prostitute Gomer (Hosea1:2). And many prophets had families, including Isaiah (Isa. 7:3; 8:3) and Moses(Exod. 2:21; 18:3–4).Proximity to death also catalyzes prophecy. Elijah, Elisha’s teacher and aformidable presence whom King Ahav and Queen Jezebel continually seek to kill,lies down to die before an angel rouses him (1 Kings 19:4–5). Hagar, Sarah’sexpelled maidservant, and her son are dying of thirst before an angel appears toher (Gen. 21:15–17). Jacob’s prophetic blessings of his twelve sons occur on hisdeathbed (Gen. 49:33), and Joseph prefaces his prediction of the exodus fromEgypt with: I am about to die (Gen. 50:24).Physical PosturesThe Hebrew Bible describes many episodes of someone “falling upon the face,”indicating a prostrate physical position, face down on the ground. It is oftendifficult to determine what this really represents. It may be physical weaknessattendant to the onset of the prophetic state. It may indicate respect for God,who appears in prophecy. Or it may reflect submission or despair.However, there are instances in which “falling upon the face” seems to directlylead to prophecy. The glory of God appears immediately after Moses and Aaronfall upon their faces in the wilderness (Num. 20:6). Ezekiel, after receivinghis initial vision, falls upon his face at which point: I heard a voice speaking(Ezek. 1:28). And Balaam, the pagan prophet, also experiences his propheticencounters “while fallen” (Num. 24:4).Other changes in physical posture may catalyze prophecy. Before Elijah performsthe miracle of ending a severe drought: he bent to the ground and set his facebetween his knees (1 Kings 18:42). And Ezekiel remains immobile on his rightside for forty days (Ezek. 4:6).“Raising the eyes” is an expression that we often find in the Hebrew Bible, inwhich case it refers to seeing something that had been previously invisible.Daniel notes: I raised my eyes and saw one man, his loins girded with fine gold,his body like crystal, his face like the appearance of lightning, his eyes likeflaming torches (Dan. 10:5–6). In addition, David: raised his eyes and saw theangel of YHVH standing between the earth and the heavens (1 Chron. 21:16). Ihave wondered if the expression refers to a technique similar to the yogicpractice of gazing intently upward that may occasion an altered state ofconsciousness.Ritual, Prayer, and SilenceParticular rituals may lead to prophecy. God tells Abraham to conduct anelaborate animal sacrifice, which culminates in his vision (Gen. 15:9–21).Prayer also is effective. God responds to Jeremiah after he offers a prayer ofthanksgiving and praise (Jer. 32:17–25). An angel explicitly tells Daniel why hehas appeared to him: I have come because of your words (Dan. 10:12). Davidadvises more silent contemplation: Be mute before YHVH and wait with longing forHim (Ps. 37:7).Samuel’s initial prophetic experience demonstrates how one might use prayer toconvert a whispering intimation of God into a wide-open dialog. Lying in hisroom at night on the grounds of the Tabernacle, he’s uncertain whether he ishearing God’s voice or that of his mentor, the High Priest Eli. Eli suggestsSamuel respond to that voice the next time he hears it by saying: Speak, YHVH,for your servant is listening (1 Sam. 3:9), and this leads to his theophany.Isaiah similarly teaches: Seek YHVH when He can be found; call upon Him when Heis near (Isa. 55:6). In other words, the inkling of inspiration, the intimationof God’s nearness, indicates that prophecy is more accessible than usual.A passage in Daniel suggests that study also is an effective preparation forreceiving prophecy. Attempting to understand what Jeremiah meant when he saidthe exile in Babylonia would last seventy years, Daniel: consulted the booksconcerning the number of years about which the word of YHVH had come to theprophet Jeremiah, to complete the seventy years from the ruins of Jerusalem(Dan. 9:2). Thereafter: the man Gabriel, whom I had previously seen in thevision, was sent forth in flight and reached me (Dan. 9:21).SPECIAL PLACESThe Hebrew Bible alludes to particular places being more conducive to attainingprophecy than others. Jacob declares after his nocturnal vision: How awesome isthis place. This is none other than the abode of God and this is the gate of theheavens (Gen. 28:17). Another stimulus appears to be proximity to water, as bothDaniel (Dan. 10:4) and Ezekiel (Ezek. 1:1) describe their visions’ onset alongthe banks of a river. And Mount Sinai clearly holds special prophecy-elicitingproperties, as Moses, Elijah, and the entire Hebrew nation apprehend God there.EXOGENOUS PSYCHEDELIC SUBSTANCES IN THE HEBREW BIBLE?Some authors propose that biblical figures experienced prophecy as a consequenceof using psychedelic plants or plant products. One possible candidate ismarijuana, an alleged ingredient of the sacred incense (Exod. 30:23).2[part0038.html#fn51] Priests burned this incense on an altar in the holiest roomof either the traveling temple that was the Tabernacle of the wilderness or theTemple in Jerusalem itself.The Israeli psychologist Benny Shanon has suggested that the burning bushmediating Moses’s theophany (Exod. 3:2) was a type of DMT-containing acacia,whose vaporized fumes he inhaled.3 [part0038.html#fn52] Or perhaps a similarlypsychedelic, LSD-like compound existed in the manna that sustained the massiveHebrew camp during their forty-year sojourn through the desert.4[part0038.html#fn53]The lack of explicit reference to mind-altering substances in the Hebrew Bibleother than wine or liquor suggests that these hypotheses are unlikely to hold upunder scrutiny. Besides, they are unnecessary. Even if one could definitivelyestablish specific examples of the use of exogenous agents, the existence ofendogenous psychedelics makes moot their discovery. We know that every humanbody is capable of making DMT, and we know the psychedelic nature of itseffects. While we do not yet know if endogenous DMT rises in conditions ofnon-druginduced altered states, I believe this scenario is significantly morelikely to be the case than discovering that Hebrew biblical figures experiencedprophecy through the agency of exogenous substances.Be that as it may, I cannot resist weighing in with the only example I see inthe Hebrew Bible that suggests an exogenous mind-altering agent. In doing so,however, I am not proposing that any specific substance is responsible. Godexplains how once a year the High Priest may enter the holiest section of theTabernacle without dying. God then adds: For in a cloud I will appear upon theArk-cover (Lev. 16:2). The Spanish commentator ibn Ezra suggests that this meansthat the High Priest entered the sanctuary burning the cloud-forming incense(Exod. 30:34–36). While commentators have suggested several possible effects ofthis cloud of incense, such as shielding the priest from the lethality of directapprehension of God, none has suggested that these effects allowed the priest tobehold God; that is, experience prophecy. Such a novel interpretation, which Ibelieve is grammatically sound, would translate the verse from Leviticus as:“Through the agency of the cloud I will appear upon the Ark-cover.”THE URIM AND THUMMIMThe High Priest of the Hebrew nation wore eight special garments and vestmentswhen performing his ritual functions. One of these items was the breastplatethat lay on the outside surface of the outermost layer of clothing. A foldedcompartment behind the breastplate contained the enigmatic Urim and Thummim,*51[part0037.html#ft52] which we encounter during the first year of the Hebrews’forty-year desert sojourn (Exod. 28:30). Most medieval Jewish commentatorsbelieve that when the Hebrew Bible says that royalty and clerics “inquired ofGod” (Num. 27:21), they were using the Urim and Thummim. The “answers” theyprovided occupied the same rank as dreams and prophecy (1 Sam. 28:6). These“prophetic instruments” were particularly useful for giving relatively simpleanswers to relatively simple questions—usually military in nature—such as whichtribe should go first in a campaign (Judg. 1:1).5 [part0038.html#fn54] By thefifth century BCE, during the construction of the Second Temple, they were nolonger in use (Ezra 2:63; Neh. 7:65)."},{"pageContent":"> Part III> > The Prophetic State: Comparison with the DMT Experience"},{"pageContent":"9OverviewOne of the theses of this book is that similarities between the DMT state andHebrew Bible prophecy reflect similar underlying mechanisms. We therefore firstneed to determine how close the resemblances are between the two sets ofexperiences. In part III, which makes up the largest part of this book, I willpresent a thorough description of the prophetic experience, comparing andcontrasting it with reports from my DMT volunteers. DMT excerpts that originallyappeared in my book DMT: The Spirit Molecule are cited as (DMT, pg), whereasthose appearing here for the first time have no citation.MATERIALS AND METHODSWhen writing a scientific paper, authors divide the manuscript into severalsections. One of these is “materials and methods.” Materials are who or whatconstitute the source of the experimental data. Are research subjects humans orrats? If rats, what strain? If humans, what are their gender and age? Materialsalso include the variables you are measuring, such as blood hormone levels orthe accuracy with which an animal runs through a maze. Methods are how theauthors collect and analyze the data that they gathered. How did they measurethose hormone levels or the accuracy of maze running? In addition, methods referto the statistical treatment of the data, which indicates whether the resultsare due to chance or the experimental intervention itself.MaterialsProphetic figures and DMT volunteers are the “subjects” of this study. The datathey provide are their accounts of the prophetic and DMT states. These two setsof individuals and their narratives are not entirely comparable. In the case ofthe DMT research, I was present in the room in our General Clinical ResearchCenter with the volunteers. I knew many of these men and women quite well,especially the first set of subjects. We shared culture, psychology, andunderstanding of the context of their drug sessions. I closely observed,supervised, and monitored their sessions, and carefully interviewed themimmediately after the drug effects had worn off.The “clinical data” I will use for articulating the prophetic state ofconsciousness, on the other hand, are reports from the Hebrew Bible of men andwomen who lived thousands of years ago in the ancient Near East: present-dayIsrael, Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, and Iraq. The altered state they enteredwas not the result of “drug administration” but “prophecy” coming upon them.They possessed vastly different psychology, language, culture, and worldviewthan the research subjects; that is, vastly different sets and settings.*52[part0037.html#ft53] I never met nor spoke with them at any time before, during,or after their prophetic experiences.Nevertheless, I believe that the prophetic figures and the DMT volunteers havemore in common than not. The Hebrew Bible paints those whose propheticexperiences it records as being similarly fleshand-blood individuals with theirown lives, and their own fears and hopes for themselves, their families, andtheir larger community. As did the DMT volunteers, they also wrestle with how tounderstand and articulate what has happened to them by virtue of having enteredinto these other worlds.MethodsWhen setting out to compare the prophetic and DMT states, I quickly realized Icould employ tools I already had developed from my DMT research. These were thecategories of subjective experience I used in constructing the HallucinogenRating Scale, which quantified phenomenological elements of the drug effect.These categories, what we called “clinical clusters,” are more or less separablefunctions of consciousness we constructed using Buddhist psychological andclinical psychiatric models.1 [part0038.html#fn55]These clinical clusters are: 1. Somatic effects*53 [part0037.html#ft54]: Sensations of the body’s position in or movement through space, weight, temperature, and visceral sensations such as nausea or cramping. An example of an item from the DMT questionnaire in this category: “feel heart beating.” 2. Affect: The quality or quantity of emotions. An example: “awe.” 3. Perception: Comprising the five external senses: taste, touch, smell, hearing, and vision. An example: “visual field overlaid with kaleidoscopic patterns.” 4. Cognition: Effects on thinking processes or thought content, including new ideas or insights. An example: “change in rate of thinking.” It also contains one’s appraisal of the state; that is, how real or unreal it seemed. 5. Volition: The ability to willfully interact with one’s own self and with the outside world, a sense of efficacy or lack thereof with respect to the body and mind. For example: “in control.”†54 [part0037.html#ft55]I began “binning” Hebrew Bible verses that referred to any spiritual—that is,prophetic—experience it records into these categories. When Jeremiah, forexample, complains of abdominal pain during his prophetic state, I placed thatverse into the somatic category. In the case of Ezekiel’s vision containingrapidly moving and brightly colored angelic beings, I binned that verse into theperceptual category.*55 [part0037.html#ft56]BEINGSThe appearance and behavior of beings in the Hebrew Bible, as well as theirrelationship with those apprehending them, share many features with those wefind in the DMT state. In the chapters that follow, I compare thecharacteristics of the two sets of beings using the categories I have justdiscussed. For example, prophetic and DMT beings look and sound a certain way;possess and effect particular emotional qualities; and demonstrate will,intellect, and awareness. Just as compelling, if not more so, are theinteractions that take place between the beings and those who perceive them.This property was so striking that it led me to develop an additional categorywith which to compare the DMT and prophetic states: “relatedness.”RELATEDNESSIn the course of binning scriptural examples of the prophetic state into theaforementioned five mental clusters, I began sensing that I was ignoring a majorproperty of the state. On further reflection, I noted that the missing factoralso existed in the DMT experience, but I hadn’t felt its absence as sharplywhen analyzing those results, perhaps due to my original preoccupation with theunitive-mystical Zen enlightenment experience. This category is that ofrelatedness and concerns the nature of the interactions between the beings andthose perceiving them. Examples include healing, harming, guarding, and mostimportant, communicating information.Relatedness provided a new metric by which I could now compare and contrast theDMT and prophetic states. As will become clear, it has helped me generateadditional evidence supporting my contention that the Hebrew Bible’sinteractive-relational model of prophecy is a more suitable model for the DMTexperience than is Buddhism’s unitive-mystical one.COMPARING MESSAGESIn the prophetic experiences of the canonical prophets, the phenomenology oftheir visions almost always is less important than the information they convey.We see this in how often someone introduces the prophetic experience simply bystating that he or she “received the word of God” and describes no associatedvisual or other perceptual features. In contrast, the DMT experience wasgenerally message-poor and phenomenology-rich. This finding required that Iswitch my frame of reference when constructing message categories for the twostates.What I mean by this is that the DMT experience was my frame of reference when Icompared the two states’ phenomenology. I binned prophetic excerpts into mywell-established DMT categories of perception, cognition, and others. However,when comparing the two sets of experiences’ message content, the more highlydeveloped, complex, and sophisticated prophetic message forced me to reversethis process. I first developed message categories through analyzing theprophetic message and then binned DMT excerpts into them. For example, theHebrew Bible’s Golden Rule suggests that we love our fellow as we love ourselvesand is therefore an “ethical” message. If one of the DMT research subjectsdescribed having come to a realization of something akin to the Golden Ruleduring his or her session, I binned that comment into the same “ethical”category into which I placed the Golden Rule.It is because of this different frame of reference that I will vary how Ipresent the prophetic and DMT excerpts when comparing their messages. Instead ofbeginning with examples of specific phenomenological categories from my DMTvolunteers and following with biblical ones, I will explicate the biblicalmessage categories first, provide scriptural examples, and then presentcorresponding excerpts from the DMT volunteers.THE APPROACH OF THE MEDIEVAL JEWISH PHILOSOPHERSI was surprised by the medieval Jewish commentators’ relative lack ofassiduousness in articulating a unique state of prophetic consciousness. At thesame time, I was gratified because this provided an opportunity for me toapproach prophecy in an innovative manner. Most of our authors define prophecysimply as apprehending God or His angels.2 [part0038.html#fn56] This approach tocharacterizing the prophetic state contrasts with the greater emphasis we findin handbooks for practitioners of kabbalistic meditation, who needed guidelinesfor gauging their progress toward union with God.*56 [part0037.html#ft57] Thosebenchmarks consist of specific alterations in consciousness, which kabbalisticauthors analyzed in much finer detail than did the medieval commentators.3[part0038.html#fn57]Maimonides does list some features of the prophetic state; for example, feelingsof energy and inspiration, and whether the experience occurs while awake orasleep. However, his primary contribution to the phenomenology of prophecyconsists of constructing a prophetic hierarchy.4 [part0038.html#fn58] He drawson certain elements of prophetic experience to establish one’s prophetic rank,instead of using those elements to establish a more value-free purelydescriptive catalog. He takes this stance in part because of his desire tomaintain—especially in the face of his controversial scientific approach toprophecy—Moses’s rank as the greatest of all the Hebrew prophets. This iscritical for his own project because he must maintain the inviolability ofMosaic law within normative Judaism, whose leader he was at the time.As an example of these contrasting approaches, Maimonides points to the floridlypsychedelic nature of Ezekiel’s visions as evidence that his level of prophecywas lower than Moses’s, in whom the medium is nearly entirely verbal. Myanalysis of Ezekiel’s prophetic experiences refers to their possessing certainvisual, somatic, emotional, and auditory properties that overlap with those ofthe DMT state. Maimonides also suggests that Abraham’s dread during hisnighttime vision (Gen. 15:12) reflects a lower level of prophecy than Moses’s,because the latter usually did not experience fear when communicating with God.By contrast, I refer to Abraham’s dread as an emotional feature of his propheticexperience, comparable to that which sometimes swept over the DMT volunteers."},{"pageContent":"10The BodyWhen I began organizing the chapters that follow, in which I compare theprophetic and DMT states, I was uncertain how to arrange them. Then I rememberedone of the prayers from my Zen community’s morning liturgy, the Heart Sutra.1[part0038.html#fn59] Midway through this short scripture is a list of the fiveskandhas, the mental functions that work together in creating subjectiveexperience. The order in which they appear in the translation my Zen communityused was: form (somatic effects), feeling (emotions), perception, consciousness(cognition), and volition. I decided to follow this order, and as my workprogressed, there seemed an inherent intelligence in how the Buddhist scripturesequenced these categories. While they exist along a certain hierarchy of“gross” to “subtle,” they also comported nicely with respect to the volume ofexamples that my present investigation yielded. The perceptual category, in themiddle of the list, contains the most excerpts from the Hebrew Bible and my DMTnotes, whereas the other four quantitatively bookend perceptual effects in asymmetric manner.Alterations in the subjective experience of the body occur in the DMT andprophetic states. We find in both physical shakiness; a sense of somethingtouching the body; changes in feelings of physical strength; fluctuations inbody temperature; and gastrointestinal, cardiac, and respiratory symptoms. Thebeings that one perceives in either state may effect these experiences; forexample, touching someone or strengthening him or her.TUMULTUOUS ONSETVarious somatic sensations occur as one transitions between the normal wakingstate and the prophetic or DMT one.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTKevin was a thirty-nine-year-old mathematician when he entered the DMT study. Hewas married to Brenda,*57 [part0037.html#ft58] another volunteer. He describedthe onset of the DMT effect: I feel a tremendous rush in my chest . . . wavescoursing through my body (DMT, 261).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYThe Hebrew word for rush actually appears in the Hebrew Bible when it describesthe onset of the prophetic state. Samuel the prophet anoints Saul as Israel’sfirst king after God chooses him, despite both God and Samuel warning the peoplethat monarchies inevitably lead to a nation’s ruin. Nevertheless, they insist,clamoring for a king so that they would be like their neighbors. Saul is atragic character, a weak-willed ruler whose inability to follow God’s dictatesresults in his losing the crown to David. In one of his earliest propheticexperiences, Saul encounters a “band of prophets” approaching him. At thatmoment: the spirit of God rushed upon him, and he prophesied in their midst (1Sam. 10:10).We also read about a wind or whirlwind—swirling, tumultuous, andrushing—appearing at prophecy’s onset. It is noteworthy that in both theexamples that follow, we read about “the” whirlwind with the definite article“the,” as if it were a known phenomenon within the culture of prophecy.Elijah lived in the ninth-century BCE Northern Kingdom and is one of the two menin the Hebrew Bible who do not die; rather, God “takes him.”†58[part0037.html#ft59] Elijah performed miracles, including raising a dead childback to life. The text introduces Elijah’s handing over his prophetic mantle tohis disciple Elisha as he is about to leave this level of existence: And it cameto pass, in YHVH’s taking, in the whirlwind, Elijah up to heaven . . . (2 Kings2:1).The biblical figure Job loses his wealth, his children, and his health as aresult of a wager between God and “the Satan”*59 [part0037.html#ft60] overwhether Job will maintain his love of God even in such dire circumstances. WhileJob rails against God, he never loses his belief in Him, and as a rewardreceives the answer he is seeking: a direct encounter with God. The first wordsin the account of his theophany are: And YHVH answered Job from the whirlwind(Job 38:1).WEIGHTI have been unable to find explicit references to feeling physical heaviness orlightness in the Hebrew Bible, thus limiting it to the DMT effect.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTAs a prelude to consciousness leaving the body, volunteers often reportedfeelings of physical lightness, as Leo noted: My body felt cool and light (DMT,344).On the other hand, some volunteers described a crushing weight, for example,Ken. He was among our youngest volunteers, twenty-three years old, a student ata school of alternative medicine in Albuquerque. Once he got his bearings in theDMT state, he said: There were two crocodiles, on my chest, crushing me (DMT,252).MOVEMENT THROUGH SPACEThe DMT volunteers often reported that their consciousness left their physicalbody and their unencumbered “DMT body” swiftly moved through space. Movementfelt upward or outward (or both) and might include the sense of flying. Those inthe prophetic state describe similar sensations of movement.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTSean was a thirty-eight-year-old family physician who received more DMT in moreprotocols than anyone else during the Albuquerque project. He described thissensation: I felt myself lifting off the bed three or four feet (DMT, 243).Philip was forty-six years old when he received the very first dose of DMT inour research. He was a long-time friend and a psychotherapist. After one of hissessions, he told us: I was flying within a vastness (DMT, 15).The beings also moved the research subject through space. Cassandra wastwenty-two years old, and in the course of her participation, experiencedsignificant relief from some post-traumatic stress symptoms. She said: Somethingtook my hand and yanked me (DMT, 169).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYA powerful wind announces the beginning of Ezekiel’s prophetic experience. Italso carries him: and then a wind lifted me and took me (Ezek. 3:14).Similar to what we find in the DMT state, biblical beings also effect movementthrough space, as Ezekiel reports: Then [the angel] put forth the form of a handand took me by a lock of my head (Ezek. 8:3).SHAKINESSThis symptom appeared more commonly at the end of the DMT experience, while inprophecy it seems to occur at various points throughout.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTWilliam*60 [part0037.html#ft61] was one of our oldest volunteers, fifty yearsold. He was retired military and was using the G.I. Bill to train in clinicalcounseling. As one of his sessions ended, he commented: I feel shaky. . . .There are little tremors going through my body (DMT, 198).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYWe will read many excerpts from the Book of Daniel in the chapters that follow.Many of us have heard of him surviving imprisonment in the king of Babylonia’slion’s den, where the king’s attendants cast him for refusing to bow to themonarch. Daniel’s visions and psychosomatic reactions to prophecy are some ofthe most remarkable in the Hebrew Bible. He lived in the sixth century BCE,where his natural talents and those of his two friends resulted in theirselection for high-level government training. During one especially grueling andconfusing set of visions, he remarks: in the vision, my joints shuddered (Dan.10:16).Habakkuk is one of the twelve minor prophets of the Hebrew Bible. He lived inseventh-century BCE Judah, the Southern Kingdom of Israel. He describes how,when he entered a prophetic state: I heard, and my inward parts trembled; mylips quivered at the sound . . . and I quaked in my place (Hab. 3:16).TEMPERATUREA feeling of inner heat or cold occurred in some of our DMT volunteers. I foundaccounts suggestive of only heat in the Hebrew Bible.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTIda was thirty-nine years old, the mother of three, and one of the fewvolunteers who dropped out after a low screening dose of DMT.†61[part0037.html#ft62] Among other unpleasant sensations, she noted: My head gotreal hot (DMT, 250).Heather was a twenty-seven-year-old midwife, one of our most psychedelicdrug-experienced volunteers, and the domestic partner of Dmitri, anotherresearch subject. She reported the opposite temperature effect: I felt I wasfreezing, like not just freezing, but turning into ice.*62 [part0037.html#ft63]A being may effect a change in temperature, as in Sean’s case: Then she [touchedmy right forehead] and warmed it up (DMT, 244).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYThe Book of Isaiah recounts events from the second half of the eighth centuryBCE in Jerusalem and from sixth-century Babylonia after the exile to thatcountry. The historical Isaiah was a contemporary of the prophets Amos, Hosea,and Micah. His wife was a prophet, and they had two sons. The first part of thebook deals with Isaiah’s rebuke of the Hebrew nation, especially the corruptmonarchy; the second deals with redemption and employs soaring messianic themesand language. In Isaiah’s initial call to prophecy, we read about how a beingmediates a temperature-related effect: One of the seraphim†63[part0037.html#ft64]flew to me, and in his hand was a glowing coal. He had takenit with tongs from atop the altar. He touched it to my mouth (Isa. 6:6–7).In addition to the subjective sense of heat in the DMT volunteers, we sometimessaw localized hives appear in response to the drug, where heat, redness, anditching occurred over the affected area.‡64 [part0037.html#ft65] The biblicalverse describing Moses’s face after he experiences prophecy points toward asimilar effect: The skin of his face sent forth light beams when He spoke to him(Exod. 34:29).GASTROINTESTINAL SYMPTOMSDMT volunteers rarely reported nausea.*65 [part0037.html#ft66] In the propheticstate, abdominal pain may appear.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTNils was one of the first two DMT volunteers, thirty-six years old at the time.He lived in a remote area of Texas and was the proverbial jack-of-all-trades. Hereceived a dose of DMT, 0.6 mg/kg, that we believed was too disorienting forsubsequent use. As the drug effect began, he exclaimed: I am going to vomit!(DMT, 9).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYJeremiah is one of the three major canonical prophets, along with Isaiah andEzekiel. He lived in late seventh- and early sixth-century BCE Jerusalem. Duringhis mission, he predicts and witnesses the fall of the capital city and therazing of the First Temple by the Babylonian legions. Jeremiah is theparadigmatic suffering prophet whom God compels to preach to unbelieving,mocking crowds and royalty, who imprison him and threaten him with death. Herehe complains of abdominal symptoms attending his prophetic encounter: My bowels,my bowels! I writhe in pain (Jer. 4:19).CARDIAC AND RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMSThose in either the DMT or prophetic state may experience difficulty breathingor feel their heart pounding.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTIda: It was hard to breathe (DMT, 250).Kevin: My heart is hammering (DMT, 261).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYDaniel: . . . nor is breath left in me (Dan. 10:17).Jeremiah: The walls of my heart! My heart is tumultuous within me (Jer. 4:19).STRENGTHPhysical weakness occurs in both states. A sensation of greater strength mayresult from the prophetic experience but not the DMT one.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTIda: I couldn’t have moved if you’ d asked me to (DMT, 250).In Ken’s case, the crocodiles pinned him firmly: I couldn’t move (DMT, 252).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYDaniel often weakens when prophecy affects him: No strength remained in me, . .. and I could retain no strength (Dan. 10:8).When prophecy overcomes Saul: [He] rushed and fell his full length to the ground(1 Sam. 28:20).In contrast to the DMT effect, increased strength sometimes occurs in prophecy.Micah is one of the twelve minor prophets, a contemporary of Isaiah, preachingin the last half of the eighth century BCE in Judah. He notes: But I am trulyfull of strength from the spirit of YHVH (Mic. 3:8).At other times, the “strengthening” is simply the return to one’s previous stateafter resolution of the weakness attendant to the initial encounter. Danielrecounts, after fainting: Then he, the likeness of a human being, touched meagain and strengthened me (Dan. 10:18).PHYSICAL STRUGGLEWhile rare in either syndrome, one may experience assault by beings, with orwithout the ability to fight back.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTKen described a terrifying vision: Two crocodiles . . . on my chest . . .crushing me, raping me anally (DMT, 252).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYJacob is a key figure in the Hebrew Bible. He is the son of Rebecca and Isaacand the grandson of Sarah and Abraham. Jacob had four wives with whom he hadaltogether a daughter and twelve sons. The latter’s descendants became thetwelve tribes of Israel. After serving his father-in-law for fourteen years inexchange for his wives, he flees with his family, only to confront his brother,Esau, and his four-hundred-man legion on the way back home to his parents.Awaiting what he thinks might be his last stand, he experiences this nocturnalevent: Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him until the break of dawn(Gen. 32:25).TRANSITION TO NORMAL CONSCIOUSNESSCertain symptoms accompany the return to normal waking consciousness from boththe prophetic and DMT states. Those with respect to the DMT experience were morestriking.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTVolunteers commented on their consciousness reentering their body “downward,”corresponding to how they felt it move upward and outward at the onset of thedrug effects.Sean described: Finally I felt myself tumbling gently and sliding backward awayfrom this Light, sliding down a ramp (DMT, 245).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYWhile consciousness “descends” at the end of the DMT experience, propheticexperience “ascends” from the individual at its termination. From the point ofview of the prophet, this would feel like a relative descent “from” prophecy.God tells Abraham that he, at one hundred years old, and his ninety-year-oldwife, Sarah, will soon have a child: When He had finished talking with him, Godascended from upon Abraham (Gen. 17:22).Ezekiel notes: The vision which I had seen rose up from me (Ezek. 11:24).RETURNING TO THE BODYA characteristic of both states, more common with DMT because of its nearlyuniversal dissociative effects, is the physical sense of being “reincarnated.”image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTLeo gradually recognized elements of his own body: I felt my breathing, my face,my fingers (DMT, 345).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYEzekiel’s vision in the Valley of the Bones may be analogous, although he is notdescribing his own body’s reanimation but that of others: The bones drew near,bone to matching bone. Then I looked, and behold, sinews were upon them, andflesh had come up, and skin had been drawn over them (Ezek. 37:7–8).SUMMARYThis chapter is the first to make a head-to-head comparison between the DMT andprophetic experiences. Minor differences exist with respect to somatic effects,such as physical heaviness or lightness in the DMT state only, heat in prophecyversus heat and cold in response to DMT, and both strength and weakness in theprophetic state but weakness alone after DMT. Much more striking is the presenceof substantial similarities. In both states, there is a tumultuous onset,effects on physical strength, movement through space, shakiness, alterations intemperature sensation, gastrointestinal and respiratory-cardiac symptoms, asense of physical struggle, and a noticeable physical element to transitioningback into normal consciousness."},{"pageContent":"11EmotionsVaried and powerful emotions characterize both the prophetic and DMT states.While some differences exist between the two, there are many more areas ofoverlap.AWE, FEAR, AND REVERENCEThese three terms encompass a broad spectrum of related feelings. Supporting thenotion of their kindred nature, the same three-letter Hebrew root Y-R-A formsthe basis for all three of these words when they appear in English translationsof the Hebrew Bible. While the context determines the exact meaning, in cases ofdoubt, my default definition is “awe” because it appears most inclusive. Mydictionary defines awe as “reverential fear” or “dread mingled with veneration.”Fear and reverence each captures only one end of a particular spectrum, whereasawe integrates them both into a more all-encompassing term.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTAndrea was a mother, wife, and software developer. Thirty-three years old whenshe volunteered for the study, she was facing some difficult life decisions.During the first several moments of the DMT effect, she screamed: No! No! No!She later explained: I was afraid. I was totally unprepared and startled andscared (DMT, 255).Brenda was a forty-two-year-old science writer, a mother of three, and marriedto Kevin, another volunteer. Regarding her first several DMT sessions, sheremarked: The colors were aggressive, terrifying; I felt as if they wouldconsume me. . . . I was terrified (DMT, 212).Ken said, in response to his crocodilian rape vision: It’s the most scared I’veever been in my life (DMT, 152).Sean, who in addition to his medical training received his undergraduate degreein religious studies, was perhaps more attuned to the nuances of the variousemotional qualities of the state: It was the awe and fear of God (DMT, 243).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYThe Book of Job consists nearly entirely of dialogue, most of which occursbetween Job and his four friends, one of whom describes: When thoughts arefilled with nocturnal visions . . . fear came upon me (Job 4:13–14).Fear and awe may mingle in prophecy, too. As Jacob flees the wrath of hisbrother, Esau, after stealing the latter’s blessing from their father Isaac, hedreams a prophetic dream and upon awakening: became frightened and said, “Howawesome is this place” (Gen. 28:17).During Ezekiel’s initiatory vision he beholds an intricate mélange of wheels,globes, and angels. The prophet describes the wheel-like Ofanim*66[part0037.html#ft67] : And there was height to them and awe to them (Ezek.1:18).Daniel describes one of the creatures in his vision of four beasts: I waswatching in night visions, and behold, a fourth beast excessively terrifying,awesome, and strong (Dan. 7:7).We read about the “witch”†67 [part0037.html#ft68] of Endor, whom King Saulcommissions to raise the ghost of the prophet Samuel. Saul is unable to prophesyand needs advice from his late teacher. When the diviner raises Samuel’s spirit,her reaction is similar to Andrea’s: The woman saw Samuel, and she screamed in aloud voice (1 Sam. 28:12).‡68 [part0037.html#ft69]David succeeds Saul as the second king of Israel. One of his goals is to housethe ark containing the stone tablets upon which God had inscribed the TenCommandments. He comes to its temporary housing to pay obeisance: But [he] couldnot go before it to seek God, for he was terrified of the sword of the angel ofYHVH (1 Chron. 21:30).Samson is a Hebrew warrior whose uncut hair provides him extraordinary strength,the secret of which his mistress Delilah tricks him into divulging. She cuts offhis hair in order to deliver him to her comrades, enemies of Israel, and theyput him to death. An angel predicts his prophetic stature to his parents evenbefore his mother becomes pregnant. His soon-to-be mother describes the angel toher husband: His appearance was like the appearance of an angel of God, veryawesome (Judg. 13:6).SAFETY, REASSURANCE, AND PEACEAt the other end of the spectrum, someone in the DMT or prophetic state may feelgreat security and comfort.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTChris was thirty-five years old when he joined the research project, married, acomputer salesman, and a part-time actor. He described how well he felt duringthe experience: Probably the most reassuring thing of my life (DMT, 191).Rex was a journeyman carpenter and forty years old when he volunteered. Duringour preliminary studies with psilocybin, he asked me to look at a lesion on hisshin, an ominous mole that a dermatologist immediately diagnosed as melanoma.While this precluded any further participation in our research, we stayed intouch until his tragic death several years later. Rex and Brenda provided two ofthe most detailed accounts of the otherworldly nature of the DMT state.1[part0038.html#fn60] During one session, a being helped guide him through thenovel terrain: When I was with her I had a deep feeling of relaxation andtranquility (DMT, 209).Carlos was one of our few non-Anglo volunteers, a Hispanic Amerindian who owneda software business and also led an urban shamanism group. He was forty-fouryears old when he joined the DMT study. He commented on the beings’(unsuccessful) attempt to soothe him: They wanted to try and reduce my anxietyso we could relate (DMT, 190).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYIn addition to the physical weakness and confusion Daniel often feels, he’sfrequently frightened, too. His angelic guide calms him by saying: Fear not. . .. Peace to you (Dan. 10:19).Gideon is one of the judges of Israel who periodically assume leadership of theHebrew tribes’ loose confederation during times of national crisis before theestablishment of the monarchy. He lived in the twelfth-century BCE NorthernKingdom. Gideon’s encounter with an angel causes him to fear for his life. Godreassures him: Peace be to you; fear not; you shall not die (Judg. 6:23).After Moses gains God’s pardon for the Hebrews’ making the Golden Calf, he asksGod to reveal Himself to him. God begins His response with: My presence will goand provide you rest (Exod. 33:14).EUPHORIA, JOY, AND HAPPINESSThese feelings are rare in the prophetic state but relatively common in the DMTone, especially after resolution of any distress associated with the tumultuousonset.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTAfter passing through the anxiety of the DMT rush, intensely powerful positivefeelings usually followed. Cleo was a forty-year-old therapist and masseuse whowas legally blind. She underwent an experience with more mystical-unitiveproperties than most of our volunteers. Here she commented on the emotionalquality of her session: The euphoria goes on to eternity (DMT, 230).Leo also noted: The ecstasy was so great that my body could not contain it (DMT,344).The beings themselves may express their own happiness. Brenda noted: They wereglad to see me (DMT, 214).She also described something that one never encounters in the prophetic record:beings eliciting laughter. She reported: I “ flew” on and saw clowns performing.They were like toys, or animated clowns. . . . I laughed out loud watching thoseclowns (DMT, 213).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYThe Book of Psalms contains 150 poems to God or about God (or both). Davidcomposed many of them, while others also contributed to the collection. OnMaimonides’ scale of prophetic excellence, David’s level of prophecy ranks atthe lowest rung; that is, experiencing an impulse to do or teach something greatto a large number of people. Therefore it is of interest to note that in Psalmswe find the greatest number of references to feeling joyful in a relationshipwith God. In other words, joy is not necessarily a sign of high propheticattainment. Correspondingly, I have rarely found a canonical or otherhigh-ranking prophet describe joy as an explicit element of their experience.As an example of David’s joy, he writes: I have set YHVH before me always. . . .For this reason my heart rejoices and my soul is elated (Ps. 16:8–9).Prayer for David is also joyful: My heart and my flesh sing joyfully to theliving God (Ps. 84:2).This excerpt from Jeremiah, generally the most melancholic of the canonicalprophets, is one of the few I could locate in which it appears his actualprophetic state is joyful. When asking God to explain why his comrades treat himso poorly, even threatening to kill him, he notes how God’s reply affects him:Your words come and I eat them, for me Your word was the joy and gladness of myheart (Jer. 15:16).GRIEF, SORROW, AND DESPAIRThese feelings are rare in the DMT state but relatively common in the propheticone. This allows us the opportunity to distinguish between the intrinsicemotional properties of the two states and the emotional responses to eachstate’s message. Much of the prophetic message, at least with respect to thecanonical prophets, concerns the destruction and exile of the Israelite nationbecause of their errant beliefs and behavior. The DMT experiences our volunteersunderwent usually conveyed much less dire information.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTCassandra’s comment followed a session in which she felt a tremendousunburdening of emotional trauma. Even in this case, it’s not clear she wasfeeling sorrow when crying: These aren’t sad tears, they are tears ofenlightenment (DMT, 172).While Leo didn’t describe the end of his DMT session as grievous or despairing,it is not difficult to read between the lines: I was dimly aware of anencroaching darkness. Were there flames, smoke, dust, battling troops, enormoussuffering? (DMT, 345).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYResponding to God’s forecast of the tragic fate of the kings of Judah, Jeremiahlaments: For the wound of the daughter of my people, I am wounded; I amblackened, desolation has grasped me (Jer. 8:21).Isaiah is disconsolate after learning of Jerusalem’s imminent downfall: Leave mealone; I will weep bitterly. Do not insist on comforting me for the calamity ofmy people (Isa. 22:4–5).LOVE AND COMPASSIONSimilar to the experience of joy, descriptions of feeling love in the propheticstate are relatively rare compared to the DMT one.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTVolunteers felt a sense of love suffuse the DMT experience and even shared thatlove with the beings.One of the first things Philip said as he emerged from the DMT world: I love. Ilove (DMT, 14).Rex described his reaction to seeing a beehivelike futuristic world: I decidedit must be a wonderful thing to live in a loving and sensual environment such asthat (DMT, 210).Elena, a thirty-nine-year-old psychotherapist, was married to another volunteer,Karl. She commented after a particularly eventful high-dose session: The greatpower sought to fill all possibilities. It was “amoral,” but it was love, and itjust was (DMT, 240).Cassandra attributed, at least in part, her emotional healing to the beings: Iwas loved by the entities or whatever they are (DMT, 173).A webpage designer and yoga practitioner, Dmitri was twenty-six years old whenhe joined our study, and also was Heather’s partner. He described his encounterwith the beings: I was filled with feelings of love for them (DMT, 197).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYMost biblical verses that address love refer to instructions for how to relateto God. For example, a verse in the Hebrew Bible that occurs in the holiestprayer of the Jewish liturgy, the Shema,*69 [part0037.html#ft70] advises: Youshall love YHVH, your God, with all your heart, with all your soul, and with allyour might (Deut. 6:5).One of the only cases I could find of a being loving someone in the propheticstate itself occurs in Daniel, when an angel tells him: Fear not, greatlybeloved†70 [part0037.html#ft71]man (Dan. 10:19).ANGER, HATRED, AND BITTERNESSThese feelings occurred rarely in the DMT state, and when they did, it was inresponse to certain phenomenological properties of the state itself; forexample, physical discomfort. In the prophetic state, on the other hand, theseemotions relate to the prophetic message one receives.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTCarlos said about the physical shakiness he felt at the end of nearly every drugsession: I hate this part (DMT, 228).Ida referred to her altered body image: I hated it (DMT, 250).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYGod tells Ezekiel to speak to the recalcitrant Israelite exiles and immediatelyafterward we read: Then a wind lifted me and took me, and I went in bitternessin the anger of my spirit (Ezek. 3:14).Here, God charges Ezekiel with specific feelings: Now you, son of man, groanwith breaking loins and with bitterness, groan in their sight (Ezek. 21:11).Jeremiah describes how God’s foretelling Israel’s destruction affects him:Therefore, I am full of the fury of YHVH; I am weary of containing it (Jer.6:11).HUMILIATIONHumiliation is a rare phenomenon and seems to occur only in relation to a being.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTDon, a waiter at a high-end local restaurant and a poet, was thirty-six yearsold when he began the DMT study. He described a “bubble” that communicated withhim in the DMT state, derogating him: We’re not going to be mean, but you’re aputz.image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYThe king of Babylonia expresses a similar reduction in self-esteem when Danielinterprets a dream for him in which: a voice fell from heaven [and said to him],. . . “We are driving you from mankind, and your dwelling will be with thebeasts of the field” (Dan. 4:28–29).ISOLATIONIn the Hebrew Bible, this feeling is related to the social and psychologicalconsequences of the prophetic message, whereas in the DMT state, it is more anintrinsic property of the experience.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTBrenda described: I felt abandoned. I’m completely and totally lost. I havenever been so alone (DMT, 212).Roland was a long-standing member of a local pagan community. Forty-three yearsold at the time of his participation, he was a successful commercial pharmacist.He noted the isolated emotional quality of his session: It was like I was amountain being mined by machines.image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYMicah is one of the twelve minor prophets. A contemporary of Isaiah, he lived inthe late eighth century BCE. His message focused on how God was to bring aboutthe fall of Judah because of the ruling class’ injustice and obsession withcourt intrigue. He laments: Woe is to me, for I am as the last of the figs, likethe gleanings*71 [part0037.html#ft72] of the vintage (Micah 7:1).Jeremiah also bemoans his isolation when he says to God: Because of Your hand Isat in seclusion (Jer. 15:17).AMOUNT OF EMOTIONSThese examples represent either an abundance of feelings or a lack of them.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTStan was a local government administrator, in his early forties whileparticipating in the project. He noted: The emotions are intense (DMT, 160).In contrast, Carlos said: There were no more emotions, because emotions workonly up to a certain point (DMT, 230).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYJeremiah quantifies his grief: My eyes drip tears day and night and do not stop(Jer. 14:17).Here, the prophetic state precludes normal grief. After Ezekiel’s wife dies, Godtells him: You will not lament, nor weep, nor will you shed your tear (Ezek.24:16).SUMMARYSimilar to what we found for physical symptoms in the prophetic and DMT states,emotional effects also are quite common in both and demonstrate convincingoverlap between them. We frequently read about awe, fear, and reverence as wellas peace, safety, and a sense of reassurance. Love, euphoria, laughter, joy, andecstasy are less common or do not occur at all in prophecy compared to the DMTstate. However, lower-level prophetic inspiration, such as occurs in the Psalms,may elicit these feelings more frequently. Unpleasant emotions occur in bothsyndromes. The DMT state itself may be dysphoric; in particular, the physicaland psychic concomitants of the rush. When sadness, anger, grief, or a sense ofisolation occurs in the prophetic state, it usually is in response to adistressing message."},{"pageContent":"12PerceptionThe preceding two chapters addressed physical and emotional aspects of the DMTand prophetic states. They have begun accommodating us to the notion that thetwo sets of experiences resemble each other to an impressive degree. Now I willconsider perceptual properties: taste, touch, sight, sound, and smell. Thischapter is by far the largest of this section and brings nearly overwhelminglyconvincing evidence that the two experiences share profound phenomenologicalsimilarities.Auditory effects are common in the DMT and prophetic states, while visual onesare even more prevalent and make up the greatest quantity of material in thischapter. Tactile sensations occur, but not frequently, and effects in thespheres of smell and taste are rare or nonexistent. The role of the beings withrespect to perceptual effects is quite significant in both conditions.TASTEimage [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTNils described a metallic, slightly bitter taste (DMT, 8–9).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYThe prophetic literature contains occasional references to taste. However, thesemay be metaphoric, in the sense of partaking of something at an intimate level.Ezekiel describes the taste of a scroll that God gives him to eat: I ate it, andit was in my mouth as sweet as honey (Ezek. 3:3).The psalmist states: Taste and see that YHVH is good (Ps. 34:9).TACTILE EFFECTSTactile sensations are of something physical impinging on or occurring justbelow the skin’s surface.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTChris noted “many hands” in his DMT session: feeling my eyes and face (DMT,191).Rex described an unusual tactile effect: I felt wet stuff hitting me all over mybody (DMT, 210).Ben, a twenty-nine-year-old former military policeman, experienced a cactus-likebeing perform the following procedure on him: I felt like something was insertedinto my left forearm, right here, about three inches below this . . . tattoo(DMT, 199).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYJob’s friend describes the onset of a nocturnal vision: A spirit brushed my face(Job 4:15).In Jeremiah’s case, God touches the prophet: And YHVH stretched out His hand andtouched my mouth (Jer. 1:9).The Hebrew Bible also describes an example of “marking” like in Ben’s case. Cainis the firstborn of Adam and Eve. He and his younger brother Abel offersacrifices to God. Cain offers crops while his brother offers sheep. God choosesAbel’s offering, and soon thereafter Cain kills Abel. Cain pleads for leniencefrom God, knowing that because he murdered his brother, his own life now hangsin the balance. God agrees and: placed a mark upon Cain, so that none that meethim might kill him (Gen. 4:15).AUDITORY EFFECTSA SoundAt the onset of both the prophetic and DMT experiences, particular soundsaccompany the transition from the normal waking state into the fully developedaltered one.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTWillow was a thirty-nine-year-old married social worker. She noted a sound asthe drug effects took hold: kind of like wings beating, off to the side.Vladan was forty-two years old when he began in our study. A filmmaker, heparticipated in several protocols and received more psilocybin than any othervolunteer in our early trials with this drug. He described the onset of the DMTstate: There was a sense of whispering voices, more like maybe wind through theleaves, but not a rustling sound . . . like hearing another world.Dmitri described the increasing intensity and overpowering nature of the soundthat accompanied the transition into a non-corporeal state: Then there was thisloud intense hum. . . . It began engulfing me. I let go into it and then . . .WHAM! (DMT, 196).All volunteers received code names—DMT-1, DMT-2, and so forth—to preserveanonymity and confidentiality. Karl was DMT-1, although not the first volunteerto receive the drug in our study. He was forty-two years old, a metalworkartist, and married to Elena, another one of our volunteers. He commented: Iheard a giggling sound—the elves laughing or talking at high-speed volume,chattering, twittering (DMT, 188).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYEzekiel describes the sound that the beings in his initial vision generate: ThenI heard the sound of their wings like the sound of great waters . . . as theymoved, the sound of a multitude like the sound of a camp (Ezek. 1:24).I described Ezekiel’s vision of the Valley of the Bones in chapter 10, onsomatic effects. As the dry bones reanimate: there was a noise while Iprophesied, and behold, a rattling (Ezek. 37:7).God’s glory is a complex and fascinating notion, occupying a transitional stagebetween God and His angels. I will discuss at some length glory’s features inchapter 16, Kavod. Its perceptual attributes figure prominently, so I willprovide a few examples here, too. Many descriptions emphasize its visualproperties, but there also are auditory ones, as Ezekiel notes: The glory of theGod of Israel was coming from the east. Its sound was like the sound of amultitude of waters (Ezek. 43:2).The shofar is a hollowed-out ram’s horn that emits a piercing blast when oneblows through it. The shofar plays a significant role in certain Jewishholidays. We first learn about it at the commencement of the revelation at MountSinai, an event that is replete with prophetic phenomena, forty-nine days afterMoses leads the Hebrew nation out of their enslaved state in Egypt. According tothe Hebrew Bible, more than 603,000 adult males witness the revelation, andrabbinic estimates of the entire camp set the number at over 2 million. This isa group prophetic experience taking place on an unimaginable scale. The textdescribes the auditory environment as the revelation begins: The sound of theshofar grew continually much stronger (Exod. 19:19).Moses reminds the Hebrew nation of what they said regarding this increasinglypowerful noise: If we continue to hear the sound of YHVH our God any longer, wewill die (Deut. 5:22).Music and SingingThese types of auditory phenomena evince a more melodic quality, rather thanbeing simply “noise” or “a sound.”image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTA forty-five-year-old, married African-American activist, Marsha described thisauditory effect: There was calliope music in the background (DMT, 164).Willow: There was a sound like music, like a score (DMT, 224).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYHearing music is rare in prophecy. In fact, I could find only one example thateven alludes to it. Crying is not musical, but keening does suggest some form ofmelody. Jeremiah mourns the fall of Jerusalem, empathizing with its inhabitants:For a sound*72 [part0037.html#ft73] like a travailing woman I heard, in pain asa woman bearing her first child (Jer. 4:31).Spoken VoiceExchange of verbal information serves an important function in both the DMT andprophetic states. However, it is not entirely clear whether what people “hear”is a spoken voice or telepathic communication, mind to mind or voice to ear.Sometimes the speaker of a voice is visible, and other times the speaker is not.Maimonides suggests that the former case represents a higher level of prophecythan the latter. We see examples of both in the DMT and prophetic experiences.In addition, the curious phenomenon of overhearing a voice, sometimes discussingthe listener, also occurs in both states.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTVladan could not see who was speaking: I heard voices but couldn’t locate them;there was a male voice and a female voice that were real distinct.On the other hand, Roland located but could not see: a normal male voice. It wasabout four inches away from my right ear.Leo clearly perceived the beings speaking to him: Welcoming, curious, theyalmost sang, “Now do you see?” (DMT, 344).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYDaniel cannot see who’s speaking, but hears: a human voice in the middle of the[river] Ulai (Dan. 8:16).Ezekiel describes an angel: It called in my ear with a loud voice (Ezek. 9:1).Ezekiel also notes the phenomenon of overhearing: As for the Ofanim, they werecalled “the Galgal”*73 [part0037.html#ft74]in my ear (Ezek. 10:13).Isaiah notes the formidable power of angels’ voices: The doorposts moved twocubits†74 [part0037.html#ft75]at the sound of the[ir] calling (Isa. 6:4).Someone experiencing prophecy may identify the spatial location of God’s voice,but not see God actually speaking to him or her. In Moses’s case: he heard thevoice speaking to him from atop the cover that was upon the Ark of theTestimony, from between the two Cheruvim‡75 [part0037.html#ft76] (Num. 7:89).SilenceLet’s end the discussion of sound with silence, the ostensible lack of sound.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTI refer to Leo’s description of the auditory effects of his DMT experience inthe Prologue. Looking more closely at those effects, they appear ambiguous andmight be interpreted as fulsome or empty, or somehow both. Here, I will adducethem in exemplifying a “type” of silence of the DMT state: I heard absolutelynothing, but my mind was completely full of some sort of sound, like theaftereffects of a large ringing bell (DMT, 344).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYSimilarly complicating the notion of prophetic silence, we read about one ofJob’s friends encountering a spirit: I heard silence and a voice (Job 4:16).VISIONThe DMT effect and prophecy are extraordinarily visual. These features are themost numerous and detailed of any perceptual category, and for that matter, ofany category of the syndromes’ phenomenology. I will begin with darkness andproceed to colors and their characteristics. Then I detail second-orderproperties of the visual components, such as their movement and recursiveness. Iconclude by describing the images themselves, ranging from simple to morecomplex.Darknessimage [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTRex: It looked like it was in a field of black space (DMT, 208).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYAt the onset of Abraham’s vision: a great darkness fell upon him (Gen. 15:12).In the vision itself, the text qualifies the nature of the darkness: and it wasdense darkness (Gen. 15:17).Deep SpaceThis phenomenon occurred only in the DMT state and contains both darkness andthe first glimmerings of light, either from stars or the earth.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTWillow: I saw deep space, white with stars. I thought I could see the lightbelow, the world’s light (DMT, 225).Cleo described her first high-dose session: I went out, into the universe—being,dancing with, a star system (DMT, 237).View from High above EarthThose in either the prophetic or DMT state refer to viewing things from greatheight.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTPhilip: Then I was above a strange landscape, like Earth, but very unearthly(DMT, 182).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYEzekiel finds himself high above earth, but not in deep space: A wind lifted meup between the earth and the heavens (Ezek. 8:3).Clouds or a CloudWe find accounts of a cloud or clouds, sometimes smoke or clouds of smoke, inboth sets of altered states. In the Hebrew Bible, such images often occur in thecontext of God’s glory. Prophetic clouds frequently are fiery and occupyrelatively well-demarcated space. They fill parts or all of the movableTabernacle or Jerusalem Temple, and pillars of smoke or fire travel with theHebrews in the wilderness. Clouds also are relevant to the notion of “emerging,”a process by which an identifiable image appears or takes shape out of arelatively amorphous visual matrix.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTSean: There were bright yellow clouds I was floating through.As an example of emerging, Philip described a humanoid figure: coming out of theclouds.image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYIn the beginning of Ezekiel’s vision in Babylonia, by the Kevar River, he sees:a great cloud with flashing fire and a brilliance surrounding it (Ezek. 1:4).After dividing certain sacrificial items in half, Abraham’s vision begins with:a smoky furnace and a torch of fire that passed between the pieces (Gen. 15:17).Moses receives the Ten Commandments on the top of Mount Sinai, where: themountain was burning with the fire up to the heart of the heavens, darkness,cloud, and thick cloud (Deut. 4:11).Daniel witnesses the emerging phenomenon: I was watching in night visions, andbehold, with the clouds of heaven one like a man came (Dan. 7:13).Flashes, Sparks, and Fire: The Equivalence of ImageryThe Hebrew Bible constantly refers to fire and fiery images, either bythemselves or associated with clouds or smoke. While DMT volunteers rarely usedthe word “fire” to describe what they saw, images in the DMT state do flash,shoot off sparks, and are “fiery.” Many of the colors they described are commonto fire: red, yellow, and orange.It seems that the DMT volunteers and those experiencing biblical prophecy may becalling by different names visual images that appear to be quite similar. Thisfinding led me to the idea of “equivalence of imagery.” The same image receivesa label consistent with that person’s psychological and cultural repertoire.This repertoire comprises the raw materials with which one constructs a notionof and labels for what he or she sees. The research subjects and people in aprophetic state both see flaming red, yellow, and orange light that movesrapidly, glows, and shoots off sparks. Whereas DMT volunteers see much less firein their lives than did nomadic and agricultural tribes from the ancient NearEast, our biblical figures never saw neon lights and Day-Glo paint. Thus, theprophets see “fire” while the research volunteers described more modern-dayfacsimiles.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTMike was a married, thirty-year-old psychology graduate student, who during asession glimpsed: a large orangish sphere, flaming, flashing, sparkling, but noton fire.Leo described an example of the “emerging” phenomenon from a fiery background:Out of the raging colossal waterfall of flaming color expanding into my visualfield . . . they stepped, or rather, emerged (DMT, 344).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYDavid describes his vision: From out of the brilliance that is before [God]burned fiery coals (2 Sam. 22:13).Similarly, Ezekiel notes: There was a brilliance to the fire, and from the firewent forth lightning (Ezek. 1:13).Daniel sees: [God’s] throne’s fiery flames, its wheels blazing fire (Dan. 7:9).Beings themselves may be fiery. Ezekiel describes the Chayot he sees in hisinitial vision: Their appearance was like fiery coals, burning like theappearance of torches (Ezek. 1:13).A being emerges from fire at the onset of Moses’s initial theophany at theburning bush: An angel of YHVH appeared to him in a flame of fire from withinthe thorn bush (Exod. 3:2).Ezekiel also reports: a great cloud with flashing fire and a brilliancesurrounding it, and from its midst came a semblance of Chashmal*76[part0037.html#ft77] from the midst of the fire (Ezek. 1:4).Colorimage [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTAllan†77 [part0037.html#ft78] was a thirty-four-year-old architect turnedsoftware designer. He noted specific colors: There’s the blue yellow core ofmeaning and semantics (DMT, 179).Chris: There were the same colors—red, golden yellows (DMT, 191).Several volunteers remarked on the preternatural intensity and clarity of thecolors. Philip described a planet over which he hovered: like a super-brightDay-Glo poster but much more complex (DMT, 182).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYBlue appears often in prophecy. In addition, the frequent occurrence of firesuggests yellow, red, and orange.Moses and the elders of Israel share this vision on Mount Sinai: Under [God’s]feet was that which was like paved work of sapphire‡78[part0037.html#ft79]brick, and it was like the essence of the heavens in purity(Exod. 24:10).After describing the complex array of beings in his vision, Ezekiel observes:Above the expanse that was over their heads was like the appearance of sapphirestone (Ezek. 1:26).Movement and RecursivenessThe final visual characteristics I wish to describe before moving on to theforms of the visual images themselves concern how the visual constituents of theDMT and prophetic states comport themselves in space. We have alreadyencountered the phenomenon of emerging from an amorphous background like cloudsor fire. In addition, there may be movement within the visions. Finally, thereis recursiveness, the endless repetition of an image.MOVEMENTimage [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTPhilip reported seeing: trailing flags, exquisite rainbow colors; they weredripping colors.Forty-six-year-old Robert*79 [part0037.html#ft80] specialized in cutting-edgeconsciousness alteration using non-drug methods such as brainwave entrainment.He described bursting into a: Day-Glo-colored space . . . throbbing and pulsingelectrically (DMT, 182).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYDeborah was one of the judges who ruled and prophesied among the looselyconfederated tribes that settled Canaan after Moses’s death and before themonarchy began with Saul. In her prophetic song, she recounts: The heavensflowed . . . and mountains melted (Judg. 5:4–5).In front of God’s throne, Daniel sees: a stream of fire was flowing (Dan. 7:10).After Adam and Eve leave the Garden of Eden, God wished to prevent either theiror their descendants’ re-entry. In order to do this: He stationed at the east ofthe Garden of Eden the Cherubim and the flaming blade of the turning sword (Gen.3:24).Whole beings may also move through space. For example, Daniel describes: the manGabriel, whom I saw in the beginning vision, was lifted in flight approaching me(Dan. 9:21).Ezekiel’s vision of the “chariot” is one of the most complex and confounding inthe entire Hebrew Bible. Some believe this is because of his relatively poorlydeveloped prophetic capacity to recognize and communicate what he sees. Here, hedescribes the movement of the four-faced or four-sided angelic beings: They didnot turn as they moved; each went in the direction of its faces (Ezek. 1:9);when they went, they would go toward their four sides, and they did not turnwhen they went (Ezek. 1:17); for whatever place the head inclined, they wentafter it (Ezek. 10:11).Ezekiel also comments on the flashing rapidity of the beings’ movement: TheChayot ran and returned like the appearance of the lightning (Ezek. 1:14).RECURSIVENESSThis is a phenomenon in which patterns or images endlessly repeat themselves, aswhen two mirrors face each other and reflect an object extending outward to thevisual horizon.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTMarsha saw: one merry-go-round after another after another (DMT, 164).And Chris observed: thousands of things flew out of these blue hands (DMT, 192).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYDaniel reports: A thousand thousands were serving [God] and a myriad myriadswere standing before Him (Dan. 7:10).In Jacob’s prophetic dream he sees: A ladder was set earthward and its topreached heavenward, and behold, angels of God ascending and descending on it(Gen. 28:12).Formed ImagesNow that we have characterized the static and dynamic components of the visualphenomena that the prophetic and DMT states share, we can move on to thespecific images the visions contain. These encompass a vast range from quitesimple to indescribably complex.ROUND THINGS: HOLES, TUNNELS, TUBES, SPIRALS, AND BALLSimage [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTWillow: First I saw a tunnel or channel of light off to the right. . . . It gotbigger farther away, like a funnel (DMT, 224).Philip: The visuals were dropping back into tubes, like protozoa, like theinside of a cell, seeing the DNA twirling and spiraling (DMT, 177).Cal was a forty-year-old video and audio engineer. His wife, Shanti, also was inthe study. He observed: There seemed to be an incubator, shaped like arectangle, with a sphere inside it.image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYAn angel transports Ezekiel to Jerusalem: He brought me to the door of thecourtyard. I looked, and behold, a hole in the wall (Ezek. 8:7).Zechariah is one of the twelve minor prophets. His mission took place during theearly Second Temple period in Jerusalem in the sixth century BCE. During one ofhis visions he sees: an entirely gold candelabrum with its bowl on top of it,and its seven lamps upon it; seven tubes for the lamps on its top (Zech. 4:2).TREESimage [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTBen: They looked like saguaro cactus,80* [part0037.html#ft81]very Peruvian incolor. They were flexible, fluid, geometrical cacti. Not solid (DMT, 198).Karl described a tree with being-like qualities: There was a female presencethat showed me a sentient tree, in full leaf.image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYIn Zechariah’s vision of the golden candelabrum, he also observes: two olivetrees above it; one at the right of the bowl, and one on its left (Zech. 4:3).The king of Babylonia relates his prophetic dream to Daniel: A tree grew andbecame strong; its height reached to the heavens; it was visible to the end ofthe entire earth (Dan. 4:7).Functional ItemsThis subcategory encompasses a broad array of images, their unifying qualitybeing their utility.FURNITUREimage [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTRobert: Rising in front of “me” was a podium-like table (DMT, 182).Tyrone was a thirty-seven-year-old psychiatric resident. He described his visionof a futuristic apartment: There was life in the furniture, like it was moldedout of something alive, an animal, a living being (DMT, 181).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYIsaiah reports: I beheld my Lord seated on a high and lofty throne (Isa. 6:1).Daniel: I watched as thrones were set up . . . and the Ancient of Days*81[part0037.html#ft82]sat, . . . His throne fiery flames (Dan. 7:9).WEAPONSimage [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTAn African female warrior confronted Kevin: She is black, carries a spear, ashield, and appears to have a mask on (DMT, 261).When describing treelike beings, Rex noted: one of them carrying a trident-likething.image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYDavid: raised his eyes and saw the angel of YHVH standing between the earth andthe heavens with his sword drawn in his hand (1 Chron. 21:16).Joshua, too, beholds: a man standing opposite him and his sword drawn in hishand (Josh. 5:13).Balaam is an enigmatic character in the Hebrew Bible. Some ancient Hebrew sagesconsider his prophetic stature equal to that of Moses. A local Canaanite kinghires him to curse the Hebrew camp on its way to Canaan, and a disaster befallsthe camp soon thereafter. On the road to the king, Balaam’s riding donkey seesthe angel before he does. Finally, he himself sees: the angel of YHVH standingon the road with his sword drawn in his hand (Num. 22:31).Architectureimage [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTSean: I watched a low-lying city on a flat plane on the far horizon (DMT, 243).Marsha found herself “in a beautiful domed structure, a virtual Taj Mahal” (DMT,163).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYArchitecture plays a significant role in the Hebrew Bible, beginning with theconstruction of the Tabernacle, a portable sanctuary that accompanies theHebrews during their forty-year sojourn in the wilderness. God shows Moses in avision all the details of the Tabernacle and its contents: They shall make asanctuary for Me . . . like everything that I show you, the form of theTabernacle and the form of all its utensils (Exod. 25:8–9).Ezekiel, like Sean, also describes a city: In visions of God [the angel] broughtme to the land of Israel and set me down on a very high mountain, and on it waslike a built city to the south (Ezek. 40:2).Repositories of InformationThe beings usually convey the prophetic and DMT states’ message verbally.Occasionally, other elements of the experience play this role; for example,visual symbols or script.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTVladan: It was like a fantasy alphabet, a cross between runes and Russian orArabic writing. It felt like there was some information in it, like it was data.It wasn’t just random (DMT, 178).Allan: Then it breaks into a ruffled reality. When I looked around, it seemedlike the meaning or symbols were there. Some kind of core of reality where allmeaning is stored (DMT, 179).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYThe king of Babylonia experiences a vision of writing that only Daniel candecipher: The fingers of a man’s hand came forth and wrote on the plaster of thewall of the king’s palace (Dan. 5:5).Ezekiel: In [a hand] was a scroll of a book. And it spread it out before me; itwas inscribed within and without (Ezek. 2:9–10).BeingsSometimes one sees only a part or parts of beings.EYESimage [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTCleo: There were some eyes, looking at me, friendly (DMT, 237).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYDaniel describes the fourth beast of his apocalyptic vision: There were eyeslike human eyes in this horn (Dan. 7:8).Ezekiel adds a detail to his description of the creatures of the chariot: Andtheir whole body, their back, their hands, and their wings, and the Ofanim werefull of eyes all around (Ezek. 10:12).HANDS AND WINGSimage [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTChris: There was a set of many hands (DMT, 191).Willow commented on the beings that lined the tunnel she passed through: Theyhad wings and tails and stuff (DMT, 224).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYEzekiel: Then I saw, and behold, a hand was outstretched to me (Ezek. 2:9).Zechariah describes flying women: They had wings like a stork’s wings (Zech.5:9).Hands and wings often associate with each other in prophetic visions. Ezekieldescribes the Chayot: Each one had four faces and each one had four wings forevery one, and there was the form of human hands beneath their wings (Ezek.10:21).A MOUTHimage [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYDaniel describes the fourth beast’s little horn possessing: a mouth speakinghaughty words (Dan. 7:7–8).OUTLINED FIGURESOnce whole figures begin to appear, they may first appear as silhouettes.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTRex: There were serpentine colors surrounding them, producing an outline oftheir shape (DMT, 204).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYThe vision of a friend of Job may possess this particular property: He stood,but I could make nothing of his appearance; an image was before my eyes (Job4:16).STATUARYimage [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTTyrone described: a massive granitic, Egyptian-like woman figure.image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYThe king of Babylonia dreams of: a huge statue, which was immense, and whosebrightness was extraordinary . . . and its appearance was fearsome (Dan. 2:31).ANIMALSInsectsimage [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTRex: When I was first going under there were these insect creatures all aroundme (DMT, 206).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYThus my Lord YHVH showed me, and behold, He was forming locusts (Amos 7:1).Birdsimage [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTGerald, a forty-two-year-old acupuncturist, reported: The presence was almostbirdlike, a predator, like a hawk or eagle.image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYIn describing the multiple faces of the creatures in his vision, Ezekielreports: the fourth, the face of an eagle (Ezek. 10:14).Reptilesimage [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTKen: There were two crocodiles (DMT, 252).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYThe Hebrew Bible mentions Leviathan, a massive reptilian sea creature, in Isaiah(27:1) and Job (40:25–32). However, it doesn’t seem to appear as a visual imagein the prophetic state itself. Rather, the notion of Leviathan plays a role inparables conveying certain moral teachings or geopolitical predictions.Mammalsimage [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYThe prophet Elijah and his disciple Elisha: were walking and talking, andbehold, a chariot of fire and horses of fire (2 Kings 2:11).The second of the four beasts in Daniel’s vision is mammalian: its appearancelike a bear (Dan. 7:5).HUMANSimage [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTVolunteers rarely saw something clearly human; more often, the figures werehumanoid, and I will discuss these below in the section entitled “BizarreFigures.”Marsha noted: There were all these dolls in 1890s outfits, life-sized, men andwomen. The women were in corsets. They had big breasts and big butts and teenyskinny waists. . . . The men had top hats, riding on two-seater bicycles. Thewomen had red circles painted on their cheeks (DMT, 164).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYMany times, we read simply about a “man” appearing in prophetic visions. Forexample, after a three-week fast, Daniel sees: one man clothed in linen, hisloins girded with fine gold. His body was like tarshish,*82[part0037.html#ft83]his face like the appearance of lightning, his eyes likeflaming torches, and his arms and legs the color of burnished copper (Dan.10:5–6).GODNo DMT research subject reported seeing God. And the Hebrew Bible doesn’texplicate God’s appearance except in the isolated example from Daniel below. Thegeneral absence of “seeing” an image of God supports the medieval Jewishphilosophers’ contention that while God’s angels or glory may appear in visions,God Itself is not visible.image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYMichaiah was a prophet in the Northern Kingdom who preached during the ninthcentury BCE. His outspoken criticism of the royal court earned him theirperpetual animosity. This is as detailed a description he provides for God’sappearance: I saw YHVH seated on His throne (1 Kings 22:19).Habakkuk describes what he sees of God: A glow was like light; rays from Hishand (Hab. 3:4).Here is Daniel’s strikingly anthropomorphic description of God, not in Hisaspect of YHVH or of Elohim, but in one that only occurs in Daniel’s book, the“Ancient of Days”: His garment white as snow, and the hair of His head likeclean wool (Dan. 7:9).BIZARRE FIGURESLet’s end this section on visual imagery with some of the most psychedeliccontents of the DMT and prophetic states. I already have included many biblicalverses from Ezekiel and Daniel that describe the fantastical beings theyencounter. In Daniel’s case, they include whole animals and their parts,humanoid figures, and statuary. Ezekiel’s enigmatic Chayot, Ofanim, Galgalim,Chashmal, and Cheruvim seem to straddle the worlds of the animate and inanimate.Similarly, the DMT volunteers also described strange creatures, some of whichwere also chimerical: human-animal, animal-animal, and human-machine.The notion of equivalence of imagery that I discussed in the section on fire andcolors above is relevant here as well when comparing the volunteers’ visions ofmachines to some of the bizarre figures in the prophetic literature. Consistentwith this notion is that the Talmud refers to Ezekiel’s vision of the creaturesas “the vision of the chariot,” a term more appropriate for a machine than forliving beings. It may represent the apprehension of an intermediate stagebetween inert matter and life, like Tyrone’s vision of living furniture.Equivalence of imagery suggests that the text uses language consistent with itspsycho-social-historical matrix in order to articulate the character of highlynovel images. Similarly, our present-day DMT volunteers wrapped language aroundthe images that drew from their own conceptual and symbolic repertoire. Forexample, Ezekiel sees wheels and spheres, whereas Marsha saw merry-go-rounds.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTWilliam described a being: One big eye, one small eye. . . . It had a slit for amouth on one side of his face, below his big eye. He had a head that was thewhole body, almost like a peak. It almost had a smile. I couldn’t see how itmoved; if it had legs, they were very short. It was dark gray.Willow observed humanlike creatures: There were large beings in the tunnel, onthe right side, next to me. There were gremlins, small, faces mostly (DMT, 224).William also described a humanlike creature when he found himself in: ahigh-tech nursery with a single Gumby,*83 [part0037.html#ft84]three feet tall,attending me (DMT, 193).Volunteers occasionally reported seeing human-animal or human-machine hybrids.Chris noted: There were rays coming out of their bodies and then back to theirbodies. They were reptilian and humanoid (DMT, 191).Lucas was one of our older volunteers, fifty-six years old. He lived off thegrid and wrote about counter-cultural themes. Just before his blood pressuredropped to dangerously low levels, he reported seeing: androidlike creaturesthat looked like a cross between crash dummies and the Empire troops from StarWars, except that they were living beings, not robots (DMT, 189).Before we instituted the practice of placing eyeshades on our volunteers, Seanobserved beings on the wall of our study room: “They” were trying to get out ofthe wall/hall. They were bright blue, shiny, silvery. The legs were moving realquickly. They weren’t alive, more like robots, androids.More explicitly machinelike objects also appeared; for example, in Brenda’scase: I saw some equipment or something, sticks with teardrops coming out ofthem. It looked like machinery (DMT, 216).William’s description is the most detailed of a machine, and he alluded to itslifelike qualities: Amazing instruments. Machine-type things. . . . There wasone big machine in the center, with round conduits, almost writhing—not like asnake, more in a technical manner. The conduits were not open at the end. Theywere solid blue-gray tubes, made of plastic? (DMT, 194).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYI have already presented some of the biblical verses that follow. However, Ibelieve it’s useful to provide more extensive excerpts in this section to bettercapture the complexity of what prophetic figures behold in these states.The first of the four beasts in Daniel’s vision is a human-birdmammal hybrid:like a lion with eagle’s wings. . . . It stood upon two feet like a man, and itwas given a human heart (Dan. 7:4).The third beast is an amalgam of two animals: like a leopard with four birds’wings on its back (Dan. 7:6).And the fourth, quite difficult to categorize:It had immense iron teeth, it was devouring and crumbling, and trampling therest with its feet. . . . It had ten horns. As I was gazing at the horns,behold, another horn, a small one, came up among them, and three of the previoushorns were uprooted before it. There were eyes like human eyes in this horn, anda mouth speaking haughty words. (Dan. 7:7–8)Ezekiel’s Ofanim appear to possess mechanical features:The appearance of the Ofanim and their nature were like the color of tarshish .. . and their appearance and their works were as if there would be a wheelwithin a wheel. (Ezek. 1:16)And finally, Ezekiel’s Chayot, the living things:They had the likeness of a man. Each had four faces for each, and each one ofthem had four wings. Their legs were a straight leg, and the sole of their feetwas like the sole of a rounded foot, and they glittered like burnished bronze.There were human hands under their wings on their four sides. Their faces andwings were [such for the] four of them. Their wings were joined to one another.. . . As for the likeness of their faces: there was a human face, and a lion’sface to the right for the four of them, and an ox’s face to the left for thefour of them, and an eagle’s face for the four of them. And as for their faces,their wings extended upward; for each [face] two [wings] were joined to eachother, and two [wings] covered their bodies. As for the likeness of the Chayot,their appearance was like fiery coals, burning like the appearance of torches.It [the fire] spread about among the Chayot. There was a brilliance to the fire,and from the fire went forth lightning. The Chayot ran to and fro like theappearance of a flash. (Ezek. 1:5–14)ClairvoyanceDMT volunteers never reported seeing things remotely, while such experiencesoccasionally occur in prophetic visions.image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYGod wishes for Ezekiel to see the idol worship occurring in the Temple inJerusalem before its destruction. It is as if Ezekiel’s disembodiedconsciousness is doing the observing far from his physical body’s location: So Ientered and saw, and behold, every form of creeping thing and abominable animaland every idol of the Family of Israel, carved into the wall, all around. Andseventy men of the elders of the Family of Israel . . . standing before them(Ezek. 8:9–11).God similarly wants Ezekiel to identify the men who have led the people astray:A wind lifted me up and brought me to the east gate of the House of YHVH . . .and behold, at the entrance of the gate, twenty-five men; in their midst I sawthe leaders of the people (Ezek. 11:1).SYNESTHESIASynesthesia is a blending or crossover of sensory modalities; for example,sounds assume visual form. Less common is the experience of visual perceptsbecoming auditory ones.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTWhen the noise of a vacuum cleaner, in reality, imposed itself on one of Sean’ssessions, he observed: The [sound of the] vacuum cleaner became an image in mymind of a big copying machine spitting out foamy paper.In Cleo’s visions she heard colors and felt them physically: The colors werewords. I heard what the colors were saying to me. . . . I not only heard what Iwas seeing, but also felt it in my cells (DMT, 238).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYIn the more typical sound-to-vision metamorphosis, we read about the Sinairevelation: And all the people could see the sounds (Exod. 20:15).Moses enlarges upon this: YHVH spoke to you from the midst of the fire; you werehearing the sound of words, but you were not seeing a likeness, only a sound(Deut. 4:12).SUMMARYThe sheer quantity of information in this chapter may feel overwhelming. If so,I hope that overwhelming has been in the service of impressing upon you thestriking degree of overlap, in quality and quantity, of the perceptualproperties of the prophetic and DMT experiences. The length of this chapter isevidence of these properties’ preeminent role in bridging the phenomenology ofthe two states.Effects on smell are absent in the prophetic and DMT experiences, those on tasteare rare, and there are occasional tactile ones. With respect to auditoryphenomena, both states include rustling, roaring, beating, and fluttering soundsthat may build in intensity and threaten to overwhelm those perceiving them. Aspoken voice, with or without a visually identifiable speaker, is common to theDMT effect and prophecy. The voice may directly or indirectly address thelistener, or he or she may simply be overhearing it. Music in the DMT experiencerarely occurred, and we never truly encounter it in prophecy.In the visual realm, we find even more features common to the DMT and propheticstates. These include darkness, vast visual perspectives, clouds, fire or fierycolors, intensely saturated and melting or flowing colors, and the recursivenessof images. When examining the actual forms that the experiences contain, commonto both are round objects, vegetation, functional items such as furniture andweapons, architecture, and information-containing symbols. Regarding the beingsin both altered states, one apprehends parts of beings, such as eyes, hands, andwings; statuary; and more or less living creatures partaking of nonhuman,humanoid, and human features. Some of these figures are quite bizarre: chimerasof animals and other animals, animals and humans, and animate objects withinanimate or machinelike objects.The visual components of the two syndromes have different elements as well. Onemay find oneself in deep, star-filled space after receiving DMT but not duringprophecy. Reptiles do not appear in the prophetic state, while they did in theDMT one; the opposite holds true for mammals. Interestingly, clearly humanfigures occur only rarely in the DMT experience, whereas they are more common inthe prophetic. The palette of colors in the DMT state at first may appeargreater than that of prophecy; however, the frequent presence of fire inprophecy may actually represent those fiery colors that the DMT subjects oftenreport. This last finding raises the issue of functional equivalence of certainfeatures of the two states, where different psychological and cultural factorsinfluence what people apprehend and how they describe it."},{"pageContent":"13CognitionTwo aspects of cognitive function, or “thinking,” figure in this comparison ofthe prophetic and DMT states: thought processes and thought content. Thoughtprocesses involve how we think—fast or slow, clear or muddled. Thought contentinvolves what we think—ideas or verbal information. The latter categoryconstitutes the message the altered state contains. In this chapter I will focusprimarily on thought processes. The meaning and the message of prophecy and theDMT experiences I will discuss at length in later chapters. One particular facetof cognition assesses the reality bases of the DMT and prophetic states. This isthe appraising capacity. We see it at work when someone asks “What is this?”“Where am I?” or “Is this real?”As with the other categories, the beings also affect cognitive function; forexample, they may clarify an otherwise confusing situation. In addition, theypossess cognitive attributes: sentience, awareness, and intelligence. In fact,these cognitive attributes are some of the beings’ most strikingcharacteristics.LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESSA common definition for consciousness is what we might call “level of awareness”or “alertness.” As medical students on the wards, we quickly learned how todetermine someone’s “level of consciousness” and subsequently communicate thatinformation to our colleagues. The spectrum ranges from coma to hyperalert.Responsiveness to the outside environment is an important factor thatcontributes to this assessment.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTVolunteers were generally unaware of what was happening either in the hospitalenvironment or to their own bodies because of the dissociation present at thepeak of the DMT effect. They were nearly always “functionally deaf,” obliviousto any outside sounds. Neither did they feel the uncomfortably firm grip of theblood pressure recording machine two minutes post-injection. This latterphenomenon was such a routine part of the experience that I didn’t write it downduring my otherwise assiduous note-taking and therefore don’t have excerpts topresent.At the same time, volunteers were quite alert internally to the subjectiveeffects of the drug. William commented on how he maintained mental clarity: WhenI’m there, I’m not intoxicated. I’m lucid and sober (DMT, 195).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYA word that appears in the Hebrew Bible to describe one’s level of consciousnessin prophecy is tardeimah. Its three-letter root R-D-M means to be in, or fallinto, a deep sleep. A closely related Arabic word means to stop up or close; forexample, a door or gap. Tardeimah, therefore, conveys the notion of reducingsensitivity to the outside world by stopping up the external senses. The onsetof tardeimah in prophecy is rapid, and one often feels an accompanying fear ordread. This sudden and emotional onset of dissociating from the outside world isreminiscent of the DMT effect, as is the maintenance of alert awareness of whatthen takes place in the altered state.Immediately before God speaks to Abraham: as the sun was about to set, tardeimahfell upon [him], and behold, a great dread (Gen. 15:12).A being may effect sleep or stupor, as in Daniel’s case: As [the angel] spoke tome, I fell into a deep sleep with my face earthward (Dan. 8:18).With Adam, it’s God who stupefies: And YHVH God cast tardeimah upon the man, andhe slept (Gen. 2:21).On the other hand, an angel may wake one up from sleep. Elijah, fleeing for hislife from the king and queen of Israel, whom he has been relentlesslyadmonishing, lies down to die in the wilderness: He lay and slept . . . andbehold, an angel touching him, and he said to him: “Rise and eat” (1 Kings19:5).CONFUSION OR LOSS OF INSIGHTWhile one might maintain mental alertness during either the DMT or propheticstate, confusion may nevertheless figure prominently.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTIda: I looked down at my feet and didn’t recognize them as my own (DMT, 250).Carlos: I didn’t know what was going on (DMT, 229).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYIn recounting his prophetic dream to Daniel, the king of Babylonia tells him: Mythoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head bewildered me (Dan. 4:2).Daniel says about his own prophetic state: I was bewildered by the vision (Dan.8:27).THE AWARENESS, SENTIENCE, AND INTELLIGENCE OF BEINGSThese features of the beings are quite striking and contribute to much of theperplexity that confronts us when we attempt to understand their nature andfunction.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTDmitri commented on how the beings expected him when he appeared in an alienlaboratory: They had a space ready for me. They weren’t as surprised as I was(DMT, 197).On the other hand, beings may not expect someone to enter into “their” world.Kevin described the female African warrior: I have surprised her. She takes anaggressive and defensive posture. She says, “YOU DARE COME HERE?!” (DMT, 261).Chris noted this aspect of the beings’ intelligence: They were recognizing andidentifying me (DMT, 191).William commented on their sapiency: I felt like an infant. Not a human infant,but an infant relative to the intelligences represented by the Gumby (DMT, 193).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYWe rarely, if ever, read explicit comments about beings’ cognitivecharacteristics in the prophetic state. It’s as if the person apprehending thebeing is thinking, “Of course, the angel or God is sentient, intelligent, andaware; otherwise, how else could this conversation be taking place?”One of the cognitive qualities of biblical beings is their capacity to interpretthe sometimes obscure contents of the prophetic vision. This implies that thebeing-explicator possesses intelligence greater than that of the questioner.During Zechariah’s vision of the golden candelabrum, he asks the accompanyingangel: “What are these, my lord?” . . . [He] said to me, “Do you not know whatthese are?” I said, “No, my lord.” He replied and said to me, saying, “This isthe word of YHVH” (Zech. 4:4–6).ASSESSMENT OF REALITYA strikingly common finding in my research was that volunteers were convincedthat intravenous DMT administration transported them to a world as real aseveryday reality, perhaps even “more real.”Several factors play a role in our assessing how real a particular experiencefeels. Temporal continuity is one and consists of sensing that time is passingas it normally does. In a related manner, we also experience cause and effectoperating in ways with which we are familiar. Things are how they are nowbecause of how they were before. Additionally, we recognize our “self ” as “I”or “me.” We feel who we are and identify that self as the one who is observingor participating in the ongoing experience. Physical solidity also contributesto our sense of reality. Finally, we may compare our present state to other,more familiar ones, such as normal consciousness or a dream.I will present more examples of how real the DMT state seemed than for theprophetic one because, as in the case of the beings’ sentience, the issue rarelyraises its head in the Hebrew Bible. The men and women we read about in the textsimply assume the reality of their experience without questioning or commentingon it. We can infer how real the biblical prophetic state seems by the absenceof any mention of its seeming unreality. In the DMT experience, however, thereality sense was something the volunteers and I were certain to discuss becauseof its surprisingly consistent and convincing quality.Uncertainty of RealityJames Kugel, a contemporary Hebrew Bible scholar, refers to “the moment ofconfusion” in prophecy.1 [part0038.html#fn61] Similar to the DMT experience,this confusion occurs at the onset of the state. In both, once people get theirbearings, much of what takes place consists of relatively normal interactionswith the newly visible world.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTKen recounted, as his horrifying encounter with crocodiles began: At first Ithought I was dreaming, having a nightmare. Then I realized it was reallyhappening (DMT, 252).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYAt the site of the burning bush, his first prophetic experience, Moses wondersif he’s “seeing things”: He saw, and behold, the bush was burning in the fire,but the bush was not consumed. Moses said, “Why will the bush not be burned?”(Exod. 3:2–3).Similarly, young Samuel wonders if he’s “hearing things” or if his teacher, Eli,is calling him: YHVH called to Samuel, and he said, “Here I am.” He ran to Eliand said, “Here I am, for you called me.” And he said, “I did not call; go backand lie down” (1 Sam. 3:4–5).Familiarity and RecognitionWhen confronting circumstances that are especially novel, we use our memory torecognize elements in the experience and to compare and contrast them with thosefrom a more familiar state. We might say to ourselves, “Does this feel like I’mdreaming?” “My blurred vision reminds me of taking too much anti-histamine,” “Isthis like alcohol intoxication?” Sometimes the present state may only allude toanother more familiar one rather than obviously resemble it.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTShanti was thirty-eight years old and the domestic partner of another volunteer,Cal. She was a therapist by trade, and her troubled son occupied much of hertime. She described a sense of familiarity with the DMT world: It’s not what itwas or was like, but more like what it reminded me of.Déjà vu is a French expression meaning “already seen.” It refers to a situationfeeling familiar even though it’s not. In Allan’s case, he had never beforeexperienced DMT. When describing his session, he recognized the feeling as déjàvu. He said: “This is just like the last time,” I thought. . . . But this is myfirst time (DMT, 223).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYThose experiencing prophecy may remember previous visions or earlier events inthe same vision. This seems to assist the prophet to understand what ispresently taking place by adding a sense of temporal continuity.Ezekiel invokes the memory of an earlier vision to identify the beings in hispresent one: These were the Chayot that I had seen beneath the God of Israel atthe Kevar River. And I knew that they were Cheruvim (Ezek. 10:20).Daniel: I still was speaking in prayer, and the man Gabriel, whom I saw in thebeginning vision, approached me (Dan. 9:21).Reality vs. the Dream StateDMT volunteers were nearly unanimous in labeling their experiences “not adream.” In the Hebrew Bible the situation is slightly more complex because manyprophetic experiences take place in “visions of the night,” an expression thatmeans for some, but not all, medieval Jewish commentators a nocturnal dream. Ifthere is a moment of confusion regarding whether the experience is a dream, asin Samuel’s case above, it resolves quickly and there is no doubt that the stateis prophetic.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTSean: It seemed so natural and complete as it was happening. It wasn’t like adream at all (DMT, 183).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYBiblical figures sometimes express their realization of the prophetic nature oftheir dream by using the term behold. This word seems to indicate the resolutionof the moment of confusion. For example, after God assents to Solomon’s requestfor wisdom, we read: And Solomon awoke, and behold, a dream (1 Kings 3:15).Another king, this time of Egypt, dreams a particularly portentous dream of anupcoming terrible famine: And Pharaoh awoke, and behold, a dream (Gen. 41:7).DeathDespite my warning the DMT volunteers that the rapid dissociation of the mindfrom the body might feel like death, some were uncertain whether they had died.In prophecy, while the awesomeness of the state may cause one to fear for one’slife, we never read about someone thinking he or she died.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTRex: I was certain I was dying (DMT, 206).Marsha: I thought I had died and that I might not ever come back (DMT, 163).As Real as Everyday RealityThere are few if any explicit references in the Hebrew Bible to how real aprophetic encounter seemed. However, this feature was more striking for the DMTvolunteers and they were certain to mention it.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTWhile this world and the DMT one are quite different, volunteers considered themexistentially equivalent. They also noted how the two levels of reality appearedto be operating simultaneously, in parallel with each other. Recognizing thatthey were inhabiting the DMT world because of an injection of a drug rarelydiminished their conviction of its reality. They considered the drug to haverevealed what they now apprehended rather than having created it. It was thereall along, simply previously invisible.Philip addressed the relationship between the two worlds. Before we asked allvolunteers to wear black eyeshades, he described the first few minutes of hissession: It was so real I had to open my eyes. When I did the scene was overlaidon top of the room. I closed my eyes, and that removed the interference withwhat I had been seeing (DMT, 182).Rex noted the same phenomenon: It’s strange being in this state but feeling yourhand on my arm and conversing, while all the alien activity is going on.Dmitri alluded to how the DMT world’s ordinariness supported its being as realas this one: It was incredibly un-psychedelic (DMT, 197). He added: My visionthere is the same here as it is there.William’s extended comments astutely captured another aspect of the DMT world:its convincing sense of being external and free-standing:This is real. It’s totally unexpected, quite constant and objective. One couldinterpret your looking at my pupils*84 [part0037.html#ft85] as being observed,and the tubes in my body†85 [part0037.html#ft86]as the tubes I’m seeing. Butthat is a metaphor, and this is not at all a metaphor. It’s an independent,constant reality. . . . This is too proximal. It’s not like some kind of drug.It’s more like an experience of a new technology than a drug. You can choose toattend to this or not. It will continue to progress without you payingattention. You return not to where you left off, but to where things have gonesince you left. It’s not a hallucination, but an observation. (DMT, 195)More Real than RealNo one in the prophetic text uses the expression “more real than real,” butseveral DMT volunteers did.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTWillow: It was so much more real than life (DMT, 224).Allan pointed out how slippery the notion of reality became when two such highlydisparate realities appeared to exist side by side: It’s more real than reality.As it gets more familiar, it seems to be more and more alien.SUMMARYIn the cognitive sphere, the DMT and prophetic states overlap to a substantialdegree. In both we find frightening initial mental confusion as one losescontact with the outside world. However, the confusion usually resolves quickly,and individuals in either state then demonstrate intact cognitive function and arather striking clear-headedness, lucidity, and intact memory. Those in the DMTstate more often struggled to determine the reality bases of their experienceand consistently concluded that the DMT world felt as least as real as this one.In prophecy, we need to infer the “as real as real” quality because we rarelyread anything to the contrary. In both syndromes the beings possess and exercisecognitive functions. They are sentient, intelligent, and aware of thoseapprehending them."},{"pageContent":"14Volition and WillVolitional effects of the DMT and prophetic states manifest in alterations inthe ability to willfully interact with one’s own body and mind, as well as withthe outside environment. This category is not as clear-cut as the ones we havealready covered because direct effects on other functions may indirectly elicitwhat appear to be explicitly volitional ones. That is, the will to do or thinksomething may exist, but not the ability. In the DMT state, for example, avolunteer may have wished to move, but somatic effects, the immobility that DMTusually caused, precluded doing so. Similarly, the cognitive effect confusionmay indirectly impact volition in that one is simply too confused to directone’s will. Nevertheless, I will include examples of these types of indirectvolitional effects in this chapter because they appear primarily volitional.*86[part0037.html#ft87]There are a limited number of volitional effects in the DMT and propheticstates. They concern movement, speaking, and overall self-efficacy. As in theother categories, the beings play a significant role.MOVEMENTCannot Moveimage [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTIn her visions, Brenda’s “nonphysical” self was unable to move through adistracting curtain of colorful light: The most intense part of each trip wasspent tangled up in these colors (DMT, 214).Karl commented on how the beings affected him: One of them made it impossible tomove (DMT, 188).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYEzekiel also cannot pass through a visual obstacle: a stream I could not cross .. . a stream that could not be crossed (Ezek. 47:5).Forced to Moveimage [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTI previously noted how Cassandra felt something physically grab her hand andyank her. Here, Robert described a similar sense of a being moving his “self ”passively: This thing sucked me out of my head and I was taken into space, ablack sky with a million stars (DMT, 189).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYGod moves Moses passively at the beginning of the Mount Sinai revelation: Moseswas drawn to the thick cloud where God was (Exod. 20:18).Ezekiel provides a fascinating and baffling observation regarding what appear tobe volitional characteristics of the beings. These are effects of the will ofone set of beings, the Chayot, on the impulse to move in another set of beings,the Ofanim. Note that the word for spirit*87 [part0037.html#ft129] in theseverses may also mean will or disposition.Each in the direction of its face[s]*88 [part0037.html#ft88]they would go;toward wherever there was the spirit to go, they went. . . . When the Chayot go,the Ofanim move by their side, and when the Chayot were lifted from upon theearth, the Ofanim were lifted. . . . To wherever there was the spirit to go theywould go, to there the spirit would go. The Ofanim were lifted opposite them forthe spirit of the Chayot was in the Ofanim. When they moved, they moved, andwhen they halted, they halted. And when they were lifted from upon the earth,the Ofanim were lifted opposite them, for the spirit of the Chayot was in theOfanim. (Ezek. 1:12, 19, 20–21)SPEAKINGCannot Speakimage [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTIn Ken’s vision of the crocodiles, he noted that in addition to their pinningand immobilizing him: I couldn’t speak (DMT, 252).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYGod tells Ezekiel: I will make your tongue cleave to your palate and you shallbecome mute (Ezek. 3:26).David describes how God indirectly, through emotions, effects a similar outcome:You grasped my eyes and I was agitated and could not speak (Ps. 77:5).Forced to Speakimage [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTMany volunteers excitedly began to describe their experiences while still underthe influence of the drug but after peak effects had resolved. They seemed tofeel a pressure to share, as Cleo’s enthusiastic inarticulateness demonstrated:I had the expectation that I would be going “out,” but I went in, into everycell in my body. It was amazing. It wasn’t just my body . . . themselves . . .themselves . . . it’s all connected. Oh, that’s what I did. Okay (DMT, 237).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYOne theory of how prophecy works is that God simply compels one in a propheticstate to speak by putting words into one’s mouth. The person acts as nothingmore than a mouthpiece for God. Some of the examples below reinforce that notionby explicitly excluding any contribution from the human speaker.When God promises to raise prophets among the Hebrews after Moses dies, He says:I will place My words in his mouth; he shall speak to them everything that Iwill command him (Deut. 18:18).Balaam the gentile prophet is keenly aware of his inability to affect his ownutterances: Am I empowered to say anything? Whatever word God puts into mymouth, that shall I speak (Num. 22:38).And Jeremiah describes his inability to resist the pressure to speak: I laboredto contain [God’s prophecy] but was unable (Jer. 20:9).SENSE OF CONTROLVolitional effects may extend beyond specific functions such as movement andspeech to a more general sense regarding how much one feels in control ofoneself as a whole. Feelings of decreased self-control are much more common thanthose of a heightened sense of control in both the DMT and propheticexperiences.Decrease of Controlimage [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTSean: I think I’ve learned what it’s like to die, to be completely helpless inthe throes of something (DMT, 223).Chris: I try and program it and I go in with an idea of what to see, but I justcan’t (DMT, 191–92).Several volunteers felt that they had received a mission, something that theexperience had imposed on them. Cal reported: I feel a responsibility, beingconscious of what I need to do. I felt the words come to me, “Teach, learn.”Dmitri: Somehow we had a mission. . . . Their work definitely had something todo with my presence. Exactly what remains a mystery (DMT, 197).Occasionally, a volunteer reported feeling that the beings manipulated his orher physical makeup. By doing so, the effect of the DMT encounter would continueto influence the passive volunteer. Rex stated: The thought came to me withcertainty that they were manipulating my DNA, changing its structure (DMT, 206).William similarly noted: The machine felt as if it was rewiring me,reprogramming me (DMT, 194).In addition, recall Ben’s experience of the cactus beings inserting a rod underthe skin of his forearm, presumably to continue influencing him after hissession.image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYA common phenomenon in the prophetic state is the sense that God “happens upon”someone and initiates the experience, instead of it occurring as a direct resultof one’s own efforts.God tells Moses how to explain the origin of Aaron’s and his mission to Pharaohto release the Hebrews from Egyptian bondage: YHVH the God of the Hebrewshappened upon us (Exod. 3:18).Similarly: God happened upon Balaam (Num. 23:4).Jeremiah is resigned to his inability to resist God’s commands: You enticed me,YHVH, and I was enticed; You overcame me and You prevailed (Jer. 20:7).God commands Ezekiel: Do not be rebellious . . . open your mouth and eat thatwhich I give you (Ezek. 2:8). Ezekiel’s response: So I opened my mouth, and Hefed me this scroll (Ezek. 3:1–2).God informs Ezekiel of how He also will force upon him a fundamental change inhis nature, a sort of rewiring: I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit Iwill put into your innards. I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh andgive you a heart of flesh (Ezek. 36:26).Samuel tells Saul that when the latter encounters the band of prophets: Thespirit of YHVH shall pass over you, and you will prophesy with them and bechanged into another man (1 Sam. 10:6).Increase or Maintenance of ControlThe maintenance of “ordinary” self-control in the face of the overpowering DMTor prophetic experience may be noteworthy in and of itself.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTCleo commented on her ability to direct her will: Then the patterns began. Isaid to myself, “Let me go through you” (DMT, 237).Brenda: A pulsating “entity” appeared in the patterns. . . . It was trying tocoax me to go with it. At first I was reluctant (DMT, 213).In one of the rare examples of a volunteer feeling a greater sense of control,Sean described: I felt like something of a god: “Put away that sound! Remove thefeeling of needing to pee!”Elena’s paradoxical comment suggested feeling more in control by having lostcontrol: I didn’t have to wonder what to do next (DMT, 241).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYIsaiah describes how he maintains his decision-making power during his initialprophetic call: I heard the voice of my Lord, saying, “Whom shall I send, andwho will go for us?” And I said, “Here I am; send me” (Isa. 6:8).Zechariah experiences a complex vision of the Temple’s High Priest, the Satan,God, and God’s angel. At a certain point, Zechariah commands an angel,representing a greater sense of efficacy than normal: I said, “Let them put apure turban on his head.” And they put a pure turban on his head (Zech. 3:5).SUMMARYWhile volitional effects occupy a relatively small portion of our comparators,robust and convincing similarities exist between the DMT and prophetic states inthis category. These include modifications in the ability to influence movementand speech, as well as more global effects on self-efficacy and self-control."},{"pageContent":"15RelatednessA Unique Prophetic CategoryAs I have previously emphasized, Buddhist psychology played a significant rolein the DMT study. Not surprisingly it also has influenced my approach to theprophetic state. The Abhidharma, the Buddhist psychological canon, helped shapethe construction of the new rating scale our team developed for statisticalanalyses of the DMT effect. In addition, Abhidharma psychological notions haveguided my comparison of the DMT and prophetic states. Just as I deconstructedthe drug effect into the familiar Buddhist categories of physicality, affect,cognition, perception, and volition, so I have done in the case of the propheticstate in these last several chapters. This method has provided us with a highlyeffective side-by-side examination of prophecy and the DMT effect.However, in DMT: The Spirit Molecule I devoted substantially more effort todescribing the narratives of my research volunteers than I did to analyzing thecomponent parts of their experiences. This is because the narratives capturedthe fullness of drug sessions to a much greater degree than did lists ofheuristically useful but relatively disconnected individual phenomenologicalelements. By treating the narratives and the phenomenology as mostly distinctfrom one another, I missed an element that may have bridged the two approaches.This element is what I refer to as a category of “relatedness.” In retrospect,my focus on the Buddhist model, especially the expectation that DMT wouldoccasion mystical-unitive enlightenment-like experiences, may have interferedwith my seeing that bridge at the time.In enlightenment, relatedness becomes moot as the subject/object dichotomy dropsaway. If there is no object and no subject, there is no relationship. However,the DMT volunteers consistently described interacting with the contents of theirexperiences, especially with the beings, in a thoroughly engaged and reciprocalmanner. On the other hand, “a-relational” enlightenment-like states wereextraordinarily rare. Sean’s account is the only truly typical one:I immediately saw a bright yellow-white light directly in front of me. I choseto open to it. I was consumed by it and became part of it. There were nodistinctions—no figures or lines, shadows or outlines. There was no body oranything inside or outside. I was devoid of self, of thought, of time, of space,of a sense of separateness or ego, or of anything but the white light. There areno symbols in my language that can begin to describe that sense of pure being,oneness, and ecstasy. There was a great sense of stillness and ecstasy (DMT,244).While Buddhism does analyze relatedness, it does so in order to do away with it.The Abhidharma describes a twelve-step model called “dependent origination”1[part0038.html#fn62] that is consistent with Buddhism’s view that the phenomenalworld, both inner and outer, has no inherent reality. This world is conditioned,composite, and ephemeral, and our restless, painful, unenlightened state resultsfrom mistaking the unreal for the real. More precisely, it is the result of aflawed relationship with the unreal, treating it as if it were real. Dependentorigination teaches practitioners to treat all these seemingly real things asobjects of meditation, the practice of which leads to a more enlightenedconsciousness.Buddhism consequently has developed meditation practices that deconstruct thecomponents of consensus reality. This process results in apprehending reality’sessential lack of substantiality and the futility of hoping to derivesatisfaction from it. The practitioner “de-realizes” every object with theintended result of distancing “the self ” from “it,” effectively precluding whatwe might traditionally consider a “relationship” with anything.Some of these meditation methods proved helpful in the DMT studies. I mightsuggest them to volunteers who felt “stuck” in particular aspects of theirexperience.*89 [part0037.html#ft89] The successful application of techniques forredirecting attention from those distracting elements usually led to a morefulfilling session. However, this approach to the DMT experience was remedialand technical rather than directing entry into a unitive-mystical experience.Instead, it helped provide a more highly articulated and deeper relationshipwith the next level of content, not emptiness, that lay behind the distractingphenomena.RELATEDNESS, THE DMT EXPERIENCE, AND PROPHECYAs I began studying the Hebrew Bible, I noticed how in a general way the DMT andprophetic states corresponded better than did the DMT and enlightenmentexperiences. Gradually, the quality of relatedness appeared as one of the basesof that superiority. In the Hebrew Bible, the relationship between oneexperiencing prophecy and God or His angels is first and foremost. It is thesummit of the prophetic state. One does not abandon the relationship orneutralize it. There is never “becoming one with” anything; rather, one “iswith” or “in” new relationships. He or she engages in as full a manner aspossible with an alternate reality that possesses a higher value than that whichhe or she normally perceives. Prophecy shares this feature with the DMT state, afeature that suggested to me the new metric of relatedness. In a way, it is a“biblical skandha.”Most of the interactions in the DMT and prophetic states occur with the beings;thus, they figure prominently in this discussion. I already have characterizedthe beings’ properties, such as their color or form, sentience, andintelligence. I also have presented examples of their effects on someoneperceiving them using the familiar somatic, emotional, and other categories.They may frighten someone (affect) or may carry him or her through space(somatic). Here, I describe more complex interactions.It may at first glance appear that the previous categories I’ve used provide asufficient framework for characterizing all of the subjective features of theDMT and prophetic states, and that a new category is unnecessary. Admittedly,some of the examples in this chapter may fit as well into one or the other ofthose I’ve already reviewed. However, I believe that the utility of the notionof relatedness will become clearer as you work your way through this material,because it captures features of the experiences that other categories do not.For example, it helps highlight how communication takes place between a beingand someone perceiving it. The notion of relatedness also exerts an organizingeffect on seemingly unrelated subjective effects, serving as a kind ofmetacategory, subsuming other functions under its domain.PHYSICAL RELATEDNESSSometimes the body is the medium of the relationship, rather than words.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTDmitri noted a “physical” relationship with one of beings: It was almost asexual bond, but not sex like intercourse, but a total body communication (DMT,197).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYIsaiah describes an angel touching his mouth with a glowing coal. This actremoves his guilt, perhaps from maligning his fellow Jerusalemites. Physicalcontact thus effects a moral transformation: He touched it to my mouth and said,“Behold, this has touched your lips; your iniquity has gone away and your sinshall be atoned for” (Isa. 6:7).AFFECTIVE RELATEDNESSI have previously noted how beings may elicit emotional effects in thoseapprehending them; for example, fear or reassurance. In addition, emotions mayact as the currency of exchange. These interactions were rare in the DMT stateand never occurred in the prophetic one.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTIn the beginning of Rex’s session, he feared for his life as insectlike beingsthreatened to overwhelm him: As I accepted my death and dissolution into God’slove, the insectoids began to feed on my heart, devouring the feelings of loveand surrender. . . . It was an empathic communication, a telepathiccommunication (DMT, 206–7).NONVERBAL PERCEPTUAL COMMUNICATIONAuditoryWhile most of what people “hear” in either the DMT or prophetic state is verbalin nature, sometimes a more inchoate sound is the medium of exchange.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTRex: The intense pulsating-buzzing sound and vibration are an attempt by the DMTentities to communicate with me (DMT, 208).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYGod tells Elijah that He does not communicate through wind, earthquake, or fire,but in: a still, thin sound (1 Kings 19:12).VisualThe following excerpts are examples of a being causing one to see a particularvisual phenomenon and thereby communicating certain information.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTKarl described beings standing on the side of a highway: They held up placards,showing me these incredibly beautiful, complex, swirling geometric scenes inthem (DMT, 188).Sean noted a green female being standing by his side while he watched a city inthe distance: She had her right hand on a dial that seemed to control thepanorama we were watching (DMT, 244).Rex commented that the beings: were sharing all this with me, letting me see allthis (DMT, 208). He also described relatively undifferentiated light as a mediumof communication: There were rays of psychedelic yellow light coming out of theface of the reassuring entity. She was trying to communicate with me (DMT, 209).Chris reported a type of sign language that three reptilian beings used todirect him toward an information-rich visual display: They were . . . trying tomake me understand, not with words, but with gestures. They wanted me to lookinto their bodies. I saw inside them and understood reproduction, what it’s likebefore birth, the passage into the body (DMT, 191).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYGod instructs Moses in how to build particular Tabernacle utensils: See andmake, according to their form that you are shown on the mountain (Exod. 25:40).In his final address to the Hebrews before his death, Moses recounts how Godmanifested to them at the Sinai revelation: and on earth It caused you to seeIts great fire (Deut. 4:36).During one of Zechariah’s visions: YHVH caused me to see four carpenters (Zech.2:3).Jeremiah: YHVH caused me to see, and behold, two baskets of figs (Jer. 24:1).Elisha’s attendant cannot see what Elisha does until: YHVH opened the lad’s eyesand he saw, and behold, the mountain was full of fiery horses and chariots (2Kings 6:17).COGNITIVE COMMUNICATIONThe aspect of cognition that receives, processes, and transmits concepts is theintellect. It is the arena in which verbal communication takes place. Manyelements are operative in verbal communication occurring in the DMT andprophetic states.Spoken vs. TelepathicDo those in the prophetic and DMT states apprehend verbal information with theears or only with their minds? While this issue is rarely explicit in theprophetic literature, it frequently appeared in my conversations with the DMTvolunteers.*90 [part0037.html#ft90] They (and we) are so accustomed to hearingthe spoken voice with the ears that any evidence to the contrary was noteworthy.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTGabe, a thirty-three-year-old rural family physician, was one of the fewvolunteers with previous experience using vaporized DMT. He described seeing“spirits of life” during his study session: They were talking to me but theyweren’t making a sound (DMT, 190).Sean added this detail regarding the green female being: She turned slightlytoward me and asked, “What else would you like?” I answered telepathically,“Well, what else have you got?” (DMT, 244).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYWhile I have already referred to this verse in chapter 12, Perception, under theheading “Silence,” I wish to present it again here as one of the only instancesI could find in which someone experiencing prophecy may be referring totelepathy. Job’s friend describes how a being communicates with him: I heardsilence and a voice (Job 4:16).Quality of CommunicationIn most cases of prophecy, the quality of verbal exchange is relatively clear,typical of a normal conversation. In the DMT state, it was more often difficultfor the subject to establish effective communication with the beings. Somevolunteers observed that the beings and they did not share a common language. Inaddition, anxiety may inhibit effective converse in both sets of experiences.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTBrenda: A male presence tries to communicate with me, but I don’t understand. Iuse my mind to ask, “What?” The reply is garbled (DMT, 212).Dmitri: They were waiting for me to acquaint myself with the environment andmovement and language of this space (DMT, 197).In Rex’s case, the intensity of communication precluded effective exchange: Theywere pouring communication into me but it was just so intense. I couldn’t bearit (DMT, 209).In a reversal of roles, Cleo needed to monitor the strength of her own attemptsto communicate: I had to be careful not to ask it too much or it would wane.Roland noted how clear communication could be: Then a voice came, like the voiceof God. . . . It was explaining things, just like a good friend would sit downnext to you.image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYHundreds of examples exist in the Hebrew Bible of “typical” conversationsbetween someone in a prophetic state and God or His angels. However, this is notalways the case, and effective communication may require special effort.God presses Ezekiel to pay better attention to improve his comprehension of Hisinstructions: Son of man, set your heart, and see with your eyes, and hear withyour ears all that I am speaking with you (Ezek. 44:5).There are several explicit references in the text to how familiar and clearverbal communication may be when it uses the expression “face to face”: YHVHspoke to Moses face to face, as a man would speak to his fellow (Exod. 33:11).Patterns of CommunicationCertain patterns emerged when I carefully examined exchanges between beings andthose who perceive them. One factor is directionality. Is communication one-wayor two-way, or are the parties relatively detached from each other, with thehumans receiving information as “bystanders”?MINIMAL ENGAGEMENTResearch subjects sometimes reported that they or the beings observed, studied,treated, and regarded each other with various levels of involvement.Simple Witnessing by the ExperientSomeone in a DMT or prophetic state may just passively observe the activities ofbeings. Ezekiel’s observation of the “chariot” is a prophetic example.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTLucas described a similar phenomenon: They were doing some kind of routinetechnological work and paid no attention to me (DMT, 189–90).Disinterested Observation by Beingsimage [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTWilliam described the Gumby-like figure watching over him: It was aware of me,but not particularly concerned. Sort of a detached concern, like a parent wouldfeel looking into a playpen at his one-year-old lying there (DMT, 193).Robert: I felt observed by the insect-thing and others like it. Then they lostinterest (DMT, 189).OverhearingAn indirect means of communicating occurs when one overhears a voice speakingabout him or her or about something else.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTWilliam, after finding himself in a high-tech playpen, remarked: Then I heardtwo to three male voices talking. I heard one of them say, “He’s arrived” (DMT,193).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYIsaiah describes overhearing a being-to-being exchange, as angels call to eachother in God’s presence: One called to the other and said, “Holy, holy, holy isYHVH of Hosts*91 [part0037.html#ft91]; the whole earth is full of Its glory”(Isa. 6:3).Zechariah is privy to a conversation between God and the Satan: YHVH said to theSatan, “YHVH will rebuke you, the Satan” (Zech. 3:2).UNIDIRECTIONALSometimes one-way communication takes the form of charging or ordering. This ismuch rarer in the DMT state than in the prophetic one.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTBrenda: They told me to “embrace peace” (DMT, 214).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYAn angel commands Ezekiel after transporting him to the Temple in Jerusalem:“Son of man, now excavate the wall.” And I excavated in the wall. . . . Then hesaid to me, “Enter and see the evil abominations which they do there” (Ezek.8:8–9).The Ten Commandments are paradigmatic examples of charging, as for example:Remember the Sabbath day (Exod. 20:8); Honor your father and your mother (Exod.20:12); and Do not steal (Exod. 20:13).Sometimes beings order or charge each other, as Ezekiel describes: [God]commanded the man clothed in linen, saying: “Take fire from between the Galgal,from between the Cheruvim” (Ezek. 10:6).Zechariah overhears two angels speaking about him, and one charges the other:Behold, the angel who was speaking to me was going forth, and another angel wasgoing forth toward him. He said to him, “Run, speak to that young man overthere” (Zech. 2:7–8).BIDIRECTIONALWe find in both the prophetic and DMT states the “question and answer” format. Abeing asks what someone sees, and then confirms, corrects, or expands upon theanswer. This pattern mimics what sometimes occurs in normal discourse when aquestion functions to initiate a conversation, or to point out the obvious,rather than reflect the questioner’s desire to know the ostensible answer. Onthe other hand, when someone in a DMT or prophetic state asks a question, thereis an overwhelming desire to learn the answer. This reflects how the beingsusually occupy a higher ranking in the relationship with respect to power,knowledge, and other variables.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTSean captured the essence of this phenomenon: I’m asking questions and gettinganswers (DMT, 243).A unique property of the DMT beings’ “speech” is its sing-song quality, liltingand repetitive. Leo reported an example: Welcoming, curious, they almost sang, .. . “Now do you see? Now do you see?” Trilling, sing-song voices (DMT, 344).Rex also spoke of this phenomenon, when after telling the insectlike beings thatGod is love, they replied: Even here? Even here? (DMT, 206)image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYThe Hebrew Bible presents a general description of this type of communication:Moses would speak and God would answer him in a voice (Exod. 19:19).In these examples, a rhetorical question serves to initiate a conversation. Anangel appears to Sarah’s maidservant, Hagar, in the wilderness: He said, “Hagar,maidservant of Sarai,*92 [part0037.html#ft92]from where have you come and whereare you going?” And she said, “I am running away from Sarai, my mistress” (Gen.16:7–8).Elijah arrives at a cave on God’s mountain, where He asks: Why are you here,Elijah? (1 Kings 19:9).God repeatedly asks Ezekiel: Do you see what they do? (Ezek. 8:6); Have youseen? (Ezek. 8:12); Do you see? (Ezek. 8:15, 17).Implying the higher rank of an angel’s knowledge than that of a prophet,Zechariah frequently asks an angel to clarify the meaning of his visions, as forexample: “What are these, my lord?” The angel replied and said to me . . .(Zech. 6:4–5).Here two beings engage in a question and answer format to help clarify forDaniel when a certain prediction might come to pass: I heard a holy onespeaking. And the holy one said to the anonymous one who was speaking, “Untilwhen, this vision . . . ?” And he said to me, “Until nightfall” (Dan. 8:13–14).ContentionA subtype of bidirectional exchange consists of arguing, complaining, testing,and bargaining with a being, attempting to change a course of events leadingtoward an undesirable outcome. The Hebrew Bible reports many examples of ratheredgy exchanges with beings, while this is much less common in the DMT state.Problems with communication may impair the DMT volunteers’ ability to engage inthis rapid give-and-take manner. However, it also may be that the frequentlycatastrophic message of the prophetic state and the prophet’s attempt to preventsuch dire predictions coming to pass makes this type of exchange less relevantto the DMT experience.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTResearch subjects described more frequently their inability to negotiate orargue with the beings. Kevin, when presented with an opportunity to push backagainst the frightening African war goddess, quickly retreated: She says, “YOUDARE TO COME HERE?!” I mentally reply, “I guess so” (DMT, 261).Ben remarked on his inability to negotiate with the beings who inserted a probeinto his arm: There were no reassurances with the probe. Simply business (DMT,199).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYMoses resists God’s charge to lead the Hebrews out of Egyptian bondage despiteGod’s reassurance, guarantee of success, and anger at his refusal. The followingdistills their exchange, in which Moses begins: “Who am I that I should go toPharaoh and that I should take the children of Israel out from Egypt?” And Hesaid, “Because I will be with you.” Moses argues that Israel’s elders won’tbelieve it is God who sent him. Moses said to God, “[When] they say to me, ‘Whatis His name?’—what shall I say to them?” God said, “‘I shall be as I shall be’”(Exod. 3:11–14). Still not convinced, Moses rejoins: “But they will not believeme” (Exod. 4:1). He then offers a more specific excuse: “Please my Lord, I amnot a man of words, not since yesterday nor since the day before yesterday . . .for I am heavy of mouth and heavy of speech.” God’s patience begins to wearthin: YHVH said to him, “Who makes a mouth for man, or who makes one dumb ordeaf, or sighted or blind? Is it not I, YHVH? So now, go! I shall be with yourmouth and teach you what you will say.” [Moses] replied, “Please, my Lord, sendthrough whomever [else] You will send.” The wrath of YHVH burned against Moses(Exod. 4:10–14). Finally, God compromises and assigns Aaron, Moses’s olderbrother, to be his spokesman.We read eleven verses describing Abraham’s challenge to God to be a true judge,attempting to shame the deity in the process, and spare Sodom and Gomorrahdespite their overwhelming wickedness:Abraham approached [God] and said, “Will You also wipe out the righteous alongwith the wicked? What if there are fifty righteous ones in the midst of thecity? Would You still wipe it out rather than spare the place for the sake ofthe fifty righteous ones in its midst? It would be a sacrilege for You to dosuch a thing, to kill the righteous with the wicked, so the righteous will belike the wicked.*93 [part0037.html#ft93]It would be sacrilege for You. Shall thejudge of the earth not do justice?” YHVH said, “If I find in Sodom fiftyrighteous ones in the midst of the city, I will spare the entire place on theiraccount.” (Gen. 18:23–26)Abraham persists and gets God to agree to spare Sodom for the sake offorty-five, forty, thirty, twenty, and finally ten. Unfortunately, even ten donot exist. Jacob bargains with the angel with whom he just wrestled, and whilehe is able to extract a blessing from him, he fails to learn the angel’s name:[The angel] said, “Let me go, for the dawn has arisen. [Jacob] said, “I will notlet you go unless you bless me.” He said to him, “What is your name?” He said,“Jacob.” He said, “No longer will it be said that your name is Jacob, but rather‘Israel,’†94 [part0037.html#ft94]for you have striven with God and with man andprevailed.” Jacob asked and said, “Tell me now your name.” He said, “What isthis that you ask my name?” And he blessed him there. (Gen. 32:27–30)PURPOSE OF THE RELATIONSHIPInteractions with beings nearly always possess a function. I divide these intothree broad types: beneficial, detrimental, and ambiguous.Beneficial: Guide, Guard, Bless, and Superviseimage [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTWillow: The larger beings were there to sustain and support me (DMT, 225).Blessing may occur in the DMT state. Gabe reported: It was more as if they wereblessing me, the spirits of life were blessing me (DMT, 190).Roland reported a being guarding him: Two spiders, white and black, the whitewas protecting me from the black one, which tried to eat me last time.Rex described beings protecting another being; in this case, his beneficentbee-like ally: I guess the guardians were keeping me from seeing her (DMT, 208).Dmitri noticed one of the beings supervising the others, implying a hierarchyamong them: There was one main creature, and he seemed to be behind it all,overseeing everything (DMT, 197).In a role reversal, Brenda helped the beings: I reached out my hands across theuniverse and prepared to be a bridge. I let this energy pass through me to them.I said something like, “See, there I did it for you. You have it.” They weregrateful (DMT, 215).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYAbraham fears that he has used up all his merit after defeating a much morepowerful military opponent. God assures him of his protection: I am a shield foryou; your reward is very great (Gen. 15:1).Jeremiah doubts his ability to withstand the people’s assaults on him whencarrying out his mission. God similarly promises: I am with you to rescue you(Jer. 1:8). He then “fortifies” the prophet with a feeling of courage: I havemade you this day as a fortified city, as an iron pillar, and as copper wallsagainst the entire land (Jer. 1:18).After awakening Elijah, who had laid down hoping to die, an angel also feedshim:An angel was touching him and said to him: “Rise, eat.” And he gazed, andbehold, near his head a coal-baked cake and a flask of water. He ate and drankand went back and lay down.*95 [part0037.html#ft95]The angel of YHVH returned tohim a second time and touched him and said; “Arise, eat, as the journey is toomuch for you.” He arose and ate and drank and went on the strength of that meal.(1 Kings 19:5–8)In this example, which I previously noted in chapter 12, Perception, a being isguarding another spiritual object. After expelling Adam and Eve from the Gardenof Eden, God: stationed at the east of the Garden of Eden the Cheruvim and theflame of the turning sword, to guard the way to the Tree of Life (Gen. 3:24).Blessing is common in the prophetic experience. We read above how Jacob forcesthe angel with whom he wrestled to bless him. Here God blesses him: And Godappeared to Jacob again . . . and blessed him (Gen. 35:9).In Ezekiel’s vision of the Valley of the Bones, he provides the beings with abenefit, as did Brenda, in this case, revivifying them: I prophesied as I hadbeen commanded, and the spirit entered them and they came to life (Ezek. 37:10).Teaching and InstructionThe primary relational role of the beings is to impart information. I willdetail that message in chapters 17 and 18, but for now, I wish to simply notethis function.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTChris remarked on the being’s educative role: They were trying to show me asmuch as possible (DMT, 192).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYZechariah beholds a complex scene containing horses, a pool, and trees. He asksan angel in the vision: “What are these, my lord?” The angel who was speaking tome said to me, “I will show you what these are” (Zech. 1:9).An angel likewise tells Ezekiel: for in order to show you have you been broughthere (Ezek. 40:4).Harmfulimage [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTExperiences of injury or a threat of harm are rare in the DMT experience. I’vedescribed Ken’s assault by crocodiles and Kevin’s confrontation with the Africanwar goddess. Volunteers did comment on a less explicit but real sense of danger.For example, Gerry, a psychiatric resident in his late twenties, heard afrightening jack-in-the-box-like being say to him: Now I’ve got you; there’s noplace to go.image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYThe angel with whom Jacob wrestles: struck the socket of his hip; so Jacob’ship-socket was dislocated as he wrestled with him (Gen. 32:26). The nextmorning: and [Jacob] was limping on his hip (Gen. 32:32).While dire predictions abound in the prophetic literature regarding the Hebrewand other nations, sometimes these are more personal, as with the DMTvolunteers. In chapter 11, Emotions, I described how the diviner of Endor allowsSaul to behold the dead Samuel’s spirit. That spirit informs Saul of hisimminent death on the battlefield: YHVH has turned away from you and has becomeyour adversary. . . . Tomorrow you and your sons will be with me (1 Sam. 28:16,19).The king of Babylonia sees a hand, part of a being, write words on the wall ofhis palace, and Daniel assumes the role of the interpreting angel: God hasmeasured your kingship and terminated it; you have been weighed in the scalesand found wanting. Your kingdom has been broken up (Dan. 5:26–28).Balaam sees a sword-wielding angel on the road only after his female donkeydoes. The angel then tells him: Had she not turned away from me, I would noweven have killed you (Num. 22:33).Ambiguousimage [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTCassandra commented on this feature of the beings: I had a feeling they couldturn on me, a little less than completely friendly (DMT, 169).Ben: They weren’t benevolent but they weren’t non-benevolent (DMT, 198–99).image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYJoshua, at the head of the Hebrew forces invading Canaan, encounters a beingwhose attitude he cannot clearly assess. He asks the angel: Are you with us orwith our enemies? (Josh. 5:13).This exchange points to another example of how the Hebrew Bible might inform apsychedelic drug experience. That is, when faced with uncertainty regarding abeing’s beneficence or malevolence, one solution is to simply ask.SUMMARYAt face value, this novel category of relatedness appears to serve at least twovaluable functions. First, it detects unique elements of subjective experiencethat the other categories do not. Second, it exerts an organizing influence ondifferent categories that may at first glance appear unrelated. For example, wemay understand individual affective and volitional effects as part of aparticular relationship rather than, or in addition to, two independentphenomena.Impressive similarities emerge when using this metric to compare the HebrewBible’s reports of prophetic experience with those of the DMT volunteers. Inboth states, the currency of exchange consists of several different modalities:sound, vision, the body, and emotions. In most cases, however, the relationshipis verbal and occurs in the cognitive field of the intellect. These verbalexchanges are more or less understandable, display varying levels ofreciprocity, and sometimes follow stereotypical patterns such as “question andanswer” and the “rhetorical question.” The effects of these various interactionsextend into a number of domains: blessing, overseeing, healing, guarding,guiding, and informing. In addition, harm may accrue to someone as a result oftheir interaction with a being.Differences exist between the two states. Emotional communication occurs in theDMT state but not the prophetic one, verbal “sparring” with beings occurs inprophecy but not in the DMT state, and only DMT volunteers felt the beingsregarding them in a detached, impersonal manner. While this latter finding mayreflect the clinical setting in which drug sessions occurred, I also am aware ofsimilar reports from those who use DMT in more social and shamanic non-researchsettings.The most salient difference between the two experiences, however, is simply thatthe interactions are much more complex in the prophetic than in the DMT state.One gets the impression that these types of exchanges are part and parcel ofwhat one might expect to encounter in the world of our biblical figures. Incontrast, the existence of and interactions with the beings frequentlynonplussed research subjects, and this impeded effective communication. Perhapswith greater regularity of contact and longer exposure, we might begin to seethe level of relatedness in the drug state approximate that of the propheticone. In addition, learning more about the beings through study of the prophetictext, in which interaction and relatedness play a critical role, may provideuseful information regarding the beings’ nature, function, and methods ofinteracting with them more effectively."},{"pageContent":"16KavodGod’s GloryThe term kavod frequently appears in the Hebrew Bible. The most commontranslation is “glory”—in particular, God’s glory. When I first came acrosskavod, I treated it as I did many of the other new and confusing terms that myinvestigation of prophecy was revealing. I noted it and put it “on the backburner,” knowing I would return to it when larger and more pressing matters hadbecome clearer. Once I began reexamining the concept, kavod appeared quitepuzzling.The notion of kavod challenges a neat association between the DMT and propheticstates. As the preceding chapters have demonstrated, an impressivecorrespondence exists between these two syndromes when we look at theirphenomenology. And while upcoming chapters will show that the informationcontent of each differs substantially in quantity and sophistication, there is ageneral thematic comportment between the two. However, kavod possesses severalfeatures that are less “typical” of prophecy itself and also are more difficultto locate within the DMT experience.In the Hebrew Bible, it is uncertain whether kavod is an angel, God, both, orsomething else. This option of “something else” is certainly viable becauseunlike other features of prophecy, kavod is visible and audible to the masses.In addition, interactions with kavod are substantially more rudimentary and lessverbal than prophetic interactions in general. These two features suggest thatkavod is an object somehow straddling the worlds of spirit and matter.Kavod’s properties are relevant to the psychedelic drug state becauseunderstanding them may shed additional light on how the Hebrew Bible may informand guide one’s sessions with these substances. In a drug session, are we seeingGod, an angel, or God’s glory? What are the differences among them? Do theymatter? Can we relate to kavod in the same manner as we relate to the beings,God, or angels, or does kavod’s atypical nature require that we approach itdifferently?BIBLICAL AMBIGUITYThe three-letter root of kavod is K-V-D, which signifies “to be heavy, weighty,honored.” It also can mean “grievous, stubborn, burdensome.” We see already howeven its basic definition is highly pliant. Thus, context determines the exactdefinition of words containing this root. For example, the Hebrew word forliver, the body’s “heaviest” visceral organ, is kaved (Exod. 29:13). The textalso uses the word kaved to describe Pharaoh’s heart when he repeatedly refusesto grant freedom to Egypt’s Hebrew slave population despite the devastation thatGod’s ten plagues are inflicting upon his country (Exod. 8:28).Kavod is more abstract than the Hebrew Bible’s anthropomorphic representationsof God possessing hands or a mouth, but more concrete than the medieval Jewishphilosophers’ notion of an incorporeal being without any conceivable orperceptible attributes. Kavod shares certain qualities with God. It possessespower, appears fiery, and interacts with those who perceive it; for example, itmay benefit or harm. Unlike God, however, the text never states that kavod feelsor expresses human emotions such as anger or love. While one may apprehend God’skavod visually, the text also tells us that what we see may not exactly bekavod. Instead it is “the appearance of the glory” (Exod. 24:17) or even “theappearance of the semblance of the glory” (Ezek. 1:28). This adds another layerof ambiguity to any discussion of the term.These shifting and transitional properties of kavod within the matrix of theprophetic literature have led translators to attempt to bring some order to theconcept. In particular, “presence”—Shechinta in Aramaic,*96 [part0037.html#ft96]rendered Shechina in Hebrew—is how most contemporary English versions of theHebrew Bible1 [part0038.html#fn63] translate kavod (e.g., Exod. 40:34). However,“the Shechina” has taken on a life of its own, variously appearing as God’swisdom, word, or logos†97 [part0037.html#ft97] ; the feeling of God’s presence;God’s care and love for His creation; providence in general; or even anautonomous anthropomorphic object of veneration in later Kabbalah.2[part0038.html#fn64]This transmogrification of kavod has caused many to overlook the original HebrewBible word and, as a result, to overlook its dynamic and liminal nature, anature that simultaneously straddles several different realms. Consistent withmy approach throughout this book, I am limiting myself to the Hebrew Bible whencharacterizing kavod as well, and we never find the noun Shechina as a synonymfor it there. Avoiding later, nonbiblical interpretations of kavod leads to amore unruly approach to the concept, but is intellectually more honest andprovides a more spacious approach to its various meanings.APPEARANCE AND IDENTITY: CLOUD AND FIRE, ANGEL AND GODKavod may reside in a particular object, be that object itself, or lackassociation with any object. The relationship among kavod, God, and an angel issimilarly fluid. We gain some insight into kavod’s shifting identity when theHebrew Bible describes its visual properties in the same or adjacent verses inwhich appear God or His angels (or both). Those visual properties resemble fire,a cloud, smoke, a smoky cloud, or a fiery cloud rather than the more highlyarticulated forms we are now familiar with.The cloud-kavod relationship: When Aaron spoke to the entire assembly of theChildren of Israel, they turned to the wilderness, and behold, the glory of YHVHappeared in the cloud (Exod. 16:10).The relationship between God and the cloud, the cloud ostensibly representingkavod: YHVH went before them by day in a pillar of cloud (Exod. 13:21).And that between God’s angel and the cloud: The angel of God who had been goingin front of the camp of Israel moved and went behind them, and the pillar ofcloud journeyed from in front of them and went behind them (Exod. 14:19).A unique visual characteristic of the kavod cloud is its density, as when Godtells Moses: Behold, I come to you in the thickness of the cloud (Exod. 19:9).Kavod often appears as fire: The appearance of the glory of YHVH was like aconsuming fire on the mountaintop before the eyes of the Children of Israel(Exod. 24:17).Similarly, after King Solomon inaugurates the Temple in Jerusalem, the entirepopulace witnesses kavod: All the Israelites were watching when the fire and theglory of YHVH descended upon the Temple (2 Chron. 7:3).God Itself may be in the fire: YHVH went before them . . . by night in a pillarof fire to give [the Israelites] light (Exod. 13:21). Or God may be in the fireand cloud: YHVH gazed out . . . in the pillar of fire and cloud (Exod. 14:24).Fire and cloud may encompass God: Cloud and thick darkness surround It. . . .Fire goes before It (Ps. 97:2–3).Here, God, kavod, and the fire all interweave with each other: The glory of YHVHappeared to the entire people. A fire went forth from before YHVH (Lev.9:23–24).Sometimes God is God’s glory, not simply residing in it, in its cloud, or in itsfire: The glory of YHVH appeared. . . . YHVH said to Moses . . . (Num.14:10–11).KAVOD OCCUPIES SPACEEzekiel explicitly refers to the “place” of God’s glory: Blessed is the glory ofYHVH from its place (Ezek. 3:12). That place is located above the beings: TheCheruvim lifted their wings and rose up from the land . . .and the Ofanim wereopposite them. . . . And the glory of the God of Israel was upon them from above(Ezek. 10:19).It fills volume: The cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and the glory of YHVHfilled the Tabernacle (Exod. 40:34).It comes: Behold, the glory of the God of Israel came by way of the east. . . .The glory of YHVH entered the [Temple] by way of the gate which opened by way ofthe east (Ezek. 43:2, 4).It ascends: Then the glory of the God of Israel rose up from atop the cheruv onwhich it had been to the threshold of the [Temple] (Ezek. 9:3).Kavod descends and also stands: YHVH descended in the cloud and it stood with[Moses] there (Exod. 34:5).Kavod possesses sides. When Moses requests seeing God’s glory, He replies: Youwill see My back, but My face may not be seen (Exod. 33:23).SOMATIC EFFECTSWhen witnessing God’s smoke and fire, presumably Its glory, atop Mount Sinai asthe revelation begins: the entire people that were in the camp shuddered (Exod.19:16).Kavod similarly physically overwhelms Ezekiel: Behold, there the glory of YHVHwas standing, like the glory that I saw by the River Kevar, and I fell upon myface (Ezek. 3:23).AFFECTJob describes the emotional quality of kavod during his theophany: On God thereis an awesome glory (Job 37:22).At the Mount Sinai revelation the members of the Hebrew camp: were afraid of thefire (Deut. 5:5).VOLITIONA property of kavod that appears throughout the Hebrew Bible is its preventingentry into the space it occupies. After dedicating the Tabernacle: Moses was notable to come to the Tent of Meeting, for the cloud rested upon it, and the gloryof YHVH filled the Tabernacle (Exod. 40:35).Similarly, subsequent to King Solomon dedicating the First Temple: The priestswere not able to stand to minister because of the cloud, for the glory of YHVHfilled the House of YHVH (1 Kings 8:11).PERCEPTIONVisionI have already discussed the fiery, smoky, and cloudy visual properties ofkavod. Additionally, kavod may possess a bright or shining quality: Like theappearance of the bow that would be in the cloud on a rainy day, so was theappearance of the brilliance all around. That was the appearance of thesemblance of the glory of YHVH (Ezek. 1:28).SoundWhile the visual aspects of kavod predominate, there also are auditory ones. Thesound may be nonverbal: The glory of the God of Israel came by way of the east,and its sound like the sound of great waters (Ezek. 43:2).One may hear God’s spoken voice emanate from the kavod cloud: YHVH descended ina pillar of cloud . . . and He called, “Aaron and Miriam” (Num. 12:5).Or God’s voice emerges simply from kavod itself without any associated visualimage: The glory of YHVH appeared to [Moses and Aaron], and YHVH spoke to Moses(Num. 20:6–7).The masses also hear God speak from the kavod fire. In this case, as with thevisual aspects, the auditory effects are not especially well articulated, beingin the manner of a “voice” and not “words”: Behold, YHVH our God has shown usHis Glory and His greatness, and we have heard His voice from the midst of thefire (Deut. 5:21).This excerpt is unusual and hints at synesthesia. God informs Moses that Itappears visually as a kavod cloud so as to be audible to the masses: Behold! Icome to you in the thickness of the cloud, in order that the people will hear asI speak with you (Exod. 19:9).RELATEDNESSInteractions between kavod and the people who perceive it are generally lesscomplex than what we have read about with respect to interactions with moretypical beings or God.Kavod may be dangerous. For example, after Moses asks God to reveal to him Hisglory, God replies: You will not be able to see My face, for no man can see Meand live (Exod. 33:20).It portends danger. Immediately before the earth opens its mouth to swallow agroup rebelling against Moses: the glory of YHVH appeared to the entireassembly. YHVH spoke to Moses and Aaron saying, “Separate yourselves from amidstthis assembly, and I shall destroy them in an instant” (Num. 16:19–21).On the other hand, kavod may shield an individual from God’s own destructivepower. The Hebrew nation declares how perceiving God through kavod has sparedthem from death: Behold, YHVH our God has shown us His glory and His greatness,and we have heard His voice from the midst of the fire. This day we saw thatYHVH will speak to a man and he can live (Deut. 5:21).Kavod feeds. When the Israelites complain of hunger in the wilderness, Moses andAaron reassure them: In the morning you will see the glory of YHVH, that He hasheard your complaints . . . when, in the evening, YHVH gives you meat to eat andbread to satiety in the morning (Exod. 16:7–8).Kavod may appear in response to prayer: Moses and Aaron came to the Tent ofMeeting, and they went out and they blessed the people,*98[part0037.html#ft98]and the glory of YHVH appeared to the entire people (Lev.9:23).Falling upon one’s face seems to indicate prayer, and as such elicits kavod:Moses and Aaron went . . . and fell on their faces. The glory of YHVH appearedto them (Num. 20:6).Kavod instructs. In this example, we get a sense of the profundity of what ahigh-ranking prophet may learn from directly experiencing kavod. After Mosesasks to see God’s glory, He prepares Moses for what His glory is like: I shallmake all My goodness pass before you, and I shall call out with the name YHVHbefore you; I shall show favor when I choose to show favor, and I shall showmercy when I choose to show mercy (Exod. 33:19).In the Messianic Era, kavod will gather in all the exiled Israelites to theirhomeland, as Isaiah foretells: The glory of YHVH shall gather you in (Isa.58:8).In this intriguing passage, we wonder if the psalmist is suggesting that afterdeath, God’s glory will accompany him: In Your counsel guide me, and afterwards,glory, You shall take me (Ps. 73:24).This example may be the only one in which someone in a prophetic state “becomesone with,” “enters into,” or “merges with” God or Its glory. Before receivingthe Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai: Moses came into the midst of the cloud(Exod. 24:18).DMTHere I note examples from the DMT reports of descriptions that share featureswith kavod.CloudIn chapter 12, Perception, I presented two excerpts describing clouds. Sean’sdescription was simply of clouds, while Philip mentioned colored clouds and ahumanoid face emerging from them. In neither case did the cloud possess any ofthe other properties of kavod.FireThere are many instances of fire-like phenomena in the DMT state, and I providedexamples in chapter 12. Only rarely do these amorphous, fiery visions partake ofkavod’s additional characteristics, such as volitional effects, as when Brendafeels “tangled up” and unable to move through the curtain of colors.RelatednessThe only instance in the DMT study of a volunteer “entering into” an amorphousbright light, akin to Moses entering the cloud on Mount Sinai, is Sean’s case,in which he merged with the bright, yellow-white light: I chose to open to it. Iwas consumed by it and became part of it (DMT, 244).SUMMARYThe Hebrew Bible’s descriptions of kavod indicate that it occupies atransitional position between a formless God and an apprehensible being. Itmorphs along a rather fluid continuum: being God or an angel, the physicallocation of God or an angel, or a proxy for God or an angel. Kavod possessesphenomenological characteristics with a lower level of articulation orcomplexity than what we find in other aspects of the prophetic state. Visuallyit is fiery, smoky, or cloudy (or a combination of those) and never takes arecognizable form, such as animal or human. At the same time, it occupies spaceand moves through it. Kavod is powerful, eliciting falling upon one’s face aswell as precluding movement into the space it occupies. It may benefit or harm,feed or protect. Kavod also is unique in that it is visible and audible to themasses. In addition, the cloud of kavod is the only manifestation of God thatone may “enter into,” similar to the mystical-unitive types of experiences morecommon in Buddhist enlightenment.Kavod is unusual within the spectrum of the prophetic state, and we also don’tencounter many kavod-like effects in the DMT experience. Its atypical featuresoffer mechanistic challenges, both biological and metaphysical. Perhapsendogenous psychedelics other than DMT play a role in how it manifests. Inaddition, different metaphysical mechanisms may mediate the apprehension ofkavod than those mediating more typical prophetic experiences. I return to theseissues when discussing the metaphysics of prophecy and of DMT as well as areasof future research."},{"pageContent":"17Message and Meaning IBelief and BehaviorThe previous chapters comparing the Hebrew biblical prophetic and theexperimental DMT states provide powerful evidence in support of my contentionthat they share phenomenological similarities. Compelling correspondences werefound in all mental categories we investigated: bodily sensations, emotions,perception, thought processes, volition, and relatedness. As always, however, wemust continue asking ourselves, “If so, so what?” Why does it matter that theprophetic and DMT experiences share these features? How is the world a betterplace knowing that such similarities exist?We may look for answers to these questions by examining the impact of the twosets of experiences. If the psychedelic state has exerted an influence on ourcivilization comparable to that of the prophetic one, then these resemblancesare more than skin deep. In other words, the psychedelic state would be notsimply a facsimile of prophecy, but truly accesses its same moral and ethicaluniverses. This would indicate that we may experience prophecy through thepsychedelic experience. However, I believe the evidence does not support thisconclusion.In the case of the psychedelic drug experience, its aesthetics—visual,emotional, and auditory—have had a much greater impact on our culture than hasits message. We see this in the presence and popularity of psychedelic art,music, and other media. However, as yet there is no cogent psychedelicphilosophy, law, theology, economics, or religion. These latter fields depend toa much greater extent on cognitive information than aesthetics.When psychedelic drugs have demonstrated a non-aesthetic impact on our culture,it has been primarily in the area of “therapy.” We consider them to exerteffects akin to psychiatric medication, and they can be used as tools to enhancevarious forms of psychological treatment. If spiritual issues do arise within anon-aesthetic context, such as occasioning spiritual states, we usually considerthem to provide primarily psychological benefit. We see this in the field of“transpersonal psychology,” which developed in response to the infusion ofpsychedelic and Eastern religious sensibilities into mainstream psychology inthe 1960s.1 [part0038.html#fn65]In contrast, the Hebrew Bible has set the course for many if not all thebastions of Western civilization for thousands of years. Its message endures andinfluences to a much greater extent than do its aesthetics, even though itsaesthetics are at least as impressive as those of the DMT experience. Forexample, the Ten Commandments are widely known, but it’s unlikely we coulddescribe the visual, emotional, and auditory components accompanying theirrevelation at Mount Sinai despite the experience itself being thoroughlymind-boggling.I found this aesthetics-rich and message-poor dichotomy to exist in my DMT dataas well. Volunteers’ experiences did contain information, both personal andspiritual. However, they wrestled mightily with how to articulate what they hadlearned, how to integrate it into their personal and social lives, and by whatmeans to communicate it. Dmitri alluded to this in chapter 14, “Volition andWill,” when he sensed that the beings and he had a mission, but he didn’t knowwhat it was.Jay, a student in his early twenties, even more cogently captured this conundrumwhen after his first high-dose DMT session he remarked: I was trying to capturethe meaning, the knowledge, not knowing what to do; to put it in some kind ofcontext, some kind of anchoring. How do you manifest it? Where’s the blueprint,the longevity? I don’t want it to just steal away.The most striking insight that the DMT subjects attained through their sessionswas that there existed a level of reality parallel to and interacting with thisone just a few heartbeats away. They noted its solidity and temporal continuity,and catalogued its contents. When they received a message during their sessions,it usually contributed significantly less to their experiences’ overall impactthan did their descriptions of the DMT state itself. And when the message wasprominent, it nearly always involved personal psychological issues, rather thanones of a larger social or spiritual nature, such as we soon will read about inthe prophetic literature.THE CANONICAL VS. NONCANONICAL MESSAGEWe must not prematurely conclude that prophecy inherently possesses a richermessage than the DMT state. It is important to note that much of the propheticmessage that has come down to us resides in the books of the canonical prophetslike Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the twelve minor prophets, and does not comefrom those who ostensibly lack a prophetic mission. Nevertheless, those latterindividuals may have attained the highest possible levels of prophecy.For example, Hagar, Sarah’s Egyptian maidservant, sees and speaks with angels,who accurately predict the future to her. The content of that prophetic stateshe experienced, that her son Ishmael would become the patriarch of a powerfuland numerous people (Gen. 16:10; 21:18), is relatively brief and has littlerelevance to ethical, legal, or theological matters compared to thecommunications of the canonical prophets. However, the brevity and personalnature of a prophetic message does not detract from its truth value. In Hagar’scase, the prediction turns out to be true—her son indeed becomes the progenitorof the numerous and powerful Arab people.PREPARING FOR WHAT FOLLOWSThis and the next chapter contain an enormous amount of information, and I feelsome conflict between my desire to paint as full a picture as possible of theprophetic message and my concern for losing the reader’s interest. In thisspirit, I often simply will refer to scriptural verses rather than quote them infull.For those already familiar with the prophetic message, I beg these readers’forbearance regarding this chapter’s length, especially if the message of theDMT state lacks enough sophistication to keep their interest. This especiallymay occur if one is seeking the same degree of correspondence between the twostates as the preceding chapters have demonstrated in the phenomenologicalrealms. Nevertheless, the information content of the DMT and prophetic states doshare significant correspondences, albeit not to the same extent that exist inthe phenomenological arena. In addition, my method of categorizing elements ofthe prophetic message may appeal to this group of readers.The detail these chapters contain also may serve those interested in prophecywho do not possess much knowledge of the Hebrew Bible. Explicating the propheticmessage to the extent that I do will demonstrate how much fuller is theinformational content of biblical prophecy than simply predicting orforetelling. And for those who are reading this material through the lens oftheir interest in the psychedelic drug state, it may provide the intellectualand ethical “context, anchoring, and meaning” that Jay was seeking in hisattempt to answer “If so, so what?”Most important, however, is that the thorough explication of the propheticmessage compared to the DMT one continues our examination of how the twosyndromes do and do not resemble each other. As these next two chapters willdemonstrate, the message of the prophetic state significantly differs from thatof the DMT experience in its possessing greater depth, breadth, complexity, andprofundity. When they do share features, we can hypothesize shared mechanisms.And when they do not, we need to search for how those mechanisms differ. It isonly through rigorous hypothesis building that we can work toward modifyingthose mechanisms in order to bring the two states into closer alignment. Theultimate aims of this juxtaposition are to make the psychedelic experience moreprophetic in its message and impact, and to make the prophetic experience moreaccessible to students of the Hebrew Bible.As I discussed in the chapter introducing the comparison between the DMT andprophetic states, the organization of the following two message chapters differsfrom the phenomenology ones. It quickly became apparent that the informationalcontent of the prophetic state is substantially greater and more sophisticatedthan that of the DMT experience. Therefore, instead of binning biblical excerptsinto my pre-existing phenomenological categories—perception, emotion, and soon—I developed ad hoc message categories using the Hebrew Bible as my frame ofreference. I then binned DMT excerpts into them. For example, one such biblicalcategory might pertain to God being merciful. If a DMT report contained areference to God’s mercy, I would place that excerpt into that biblicalgrouping. In addition, because much of the prophetic message does not have acounterpart in the DMT volunteers’ reports, there are many categories thatcontain only biblical references and no DMT ones.ELEMENTS OF THE PROPHETIC MESSAGEThe message of the Hebrew Bible covers a vast scope, and its seeminginconsistencies tax our capacities. It tells us that humans are created in God’simage, but accepts the institution of slavery. It teaches us not to murder andthat one day humanity will disarm and live in universal peace, but also permitsthe taking of life in certain circumstances such as capital punishment and war.The text teaches kindness to and empathy with animals while prescribing allmanner of animal sacrifice. The message of the Hebrew Bible is as challenging asit is all-encompassing.Belief and BehaviorWe may divide the information one obtains in any spiritual experience into tworelated categories: those pertaining to belief and those pertaining to behavior.Beliefs concern the nature of the physical and spiritual worlds. In the HebrewBible, information regarding God’s attributes and actions are essential to anysuch set of beliefs. Behavior involves how we relate to our bodies and minds aswell as to the outside world—natural, social, and spiritual. The Hebrew Bibleconjoins these two categories of belief and behavior by teaching that accuratebeliefs about God lead to specific ethical behavior based thereon.Foretelling, Including the “World to Come”Prediction figures prominently in the Hebrew Bible, as it explicates God’sinvolvement in history. Foretelling also occurs, though rarely, in the DMTstate. The time span of prediction in both sets of experiences may be uncertain.Of great interest are descriptions, relatively common in prophecy and occurringoccasionally in the DMT experience, of the “world to come.” When describing this“world to come,” we begin to encounter allusions in the Hebrew Bible to certainDMT-like elements characterizing this qualitatively different level of futureexistence.False Prophets and False ProphecyAccuracy of prediction is important in differentiating “true” from “false”prophecy, a topic of great concern to the Hebrew Bible and the medieval Jewishphilosophers. However, several other factors play at least as important a rolein recognizing the false prophet and false prophecy, including the nature of themessage and the character of its bearer. False prophecy is relevant to thepsychedelic state because we must exercise great care in deciding whether theinformation we obtain during a drug experience is accurate, true, and beneficialrather than simply another way in which we delude ourselves and others.Wisdom and PoetryThe Hebrew Bible contains a wisdom literature: Job, Proverbs, and Ecclesiastesbeing representative of the genre. Here we explicitly learn about properattitudes and behavior by which to live one’s life. In addition, the 150 poeticprayers of Psalms and the tale of love that the Song of Songs recounts haveprovided inspiration and solace to hundreds of generations throughout the world.WHAT GOD ISThe prophetic articulation of God’s nature and actions constitutes a significantportion of the Hebrew Bible. When information about God appears in the DMTreports, it generally comports with the prophetic text. In addition, there areregular examples in my DMT notes of volunteers describing “something” that forall intents and purposes could have been “God” if that something manifestedwithin the prophetic context. Therefore, I include these examples, too, asconcerning God.Knowledge of God includes seeing His role in our personal lives, in nature, andon the stage of world history. That knowledge dovetails with guidelines for theconduct of individual and public life, the complex scaffolding of laws in theHebrew Bible. Such laws oversee every aspect of our existence: commerce andexchange, diet, agriculture, medicine, war, family life, rites and rituals, andso on. Our degree of compliance with these guidelines determines the operationof God’s “justice.” This term represents overlaying cause and effect with ananthropomorphic cognitive filter that assumes a certain value system. Generallyspeaking, compliance with God’s precepts leads to the “rewards” of happiness,health, peace, and similar boons, and noncompliance leads to the “punishments”of war, illness, natural disasters, and similar banes. We also learn that it ispossible to petition God by various means to temper with mercy His strictapplication of justice.While reviewing this material, remember that God’s attributes are, strictlyspeaking, inconceivable. References to them partake of homonymy, as I discussedin chapter 7, God. They are the “next best thing” to an accurate description. Bysaying, for example, that God is “eternal,” this simply means that It is notlimited by time, because It “existed” before existence and will continue to“exist” after existence. These are notions that we cannot possibly comprehend.However, “eternal” as an approximate description is better than a wrong one,such as “temporary,” or positing that God does not exist at all.God ExistsThe most essential attribute of God is that It exists, or more precisely,doesn’t not exist. We usually find the name YHVH in this context. Moses sings asong to the Hebrew nation just before his death, in which he speaks for YHVH:For I, I am It (Deut. 32:39).God LivesGod lives, or rather, is not dead. In the context of God “taking an oath” tofulfill His word, He expressly states: as I live (Num. 14:28).God Is OneThe expression “one” may mean several things: qualitatively unique among itskind, indivisible, or the only one of its species. In this verse, which makes uppart of the Shema, the most well-known Jewish prayer, “one” may refer to allthree of these definitions. Hear, Israel: YHVH is our God, YHVH is one (Deut.6:4).God Is EternalAs the rabbinical adage has it, “Time exists within God, but God does not existin time.” God tells Isaiah: Even before there was a day I am It (Isa. 43:13),whereas the psalmist compares the temporal nature of heaven and earth with God’seternality: They will perish, but You will endure (Ps. 102:27).God Possesses Will and Unlimited Power, Knowledge, and PresenceThese different attributes are difficult to isolate in a pure and distinctmanner. For example, there exists an ineluctable relationship between God’somnipresence and omniscience; in other words, because God is everywhere, It isaware of everything. And God’s omnipresence and omniscience make possible theexecution of His will through His omnipotence.God’s answer to Moses’s question regarding His name reflects the simplepossession of will: I shall be what I shall be (Exod. 3:14).God’s power is limitless: When I do, who can reverse it? (Isa. 43:13).Will and power combine in the act of creation: God said, “Let there be light,”and there was light (Gen. 1:3).God’s omniscience extends to the inanimate world: There is no rock that I do notknow (Isa. 44:8); to the entire universe: He reveals the deep and themysterious, knows what is in the dark (Dan. 2:22); to our own hearts andactions: For YHVH is a God of thoughts, and to Him are deeds counted (1 Sam.2:3); no matter where we are: If I ascend to heaven You are there; if I make mybed in the lowest depths, behold, You are there (Ps. 139:8).image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTElena witnessed the universe’s creation as an act of cosmic will: Then the words“ just because it is possible” emerged out of nothingness (DMT, 240). She alsoreferred to God’s power: It was all-powerful, all-immense; it was Yahweh.Cleo referred to God’s omnipresence: I was looking for God outside. [The beings]said, “God is in every cell of your body” (DMT, 238).Incorporeal and Corporeal Descriptions of GodGod’s omnipresence seems incompatible with Its possessing a body or occupyingspace. We read accounts of both God’s corporeality, such as the occasion whenthe prophet sees God “standing on a wall” (Amos 7:7), and incorporeality, aswhen Moses reminds the Hebrews that they “saw no form” at the Mount Sinairevelation (Deut. 4:15). King Solomon captures this conundrum when he rues thatwhile the “heavens cannot contain” God, how is it possible for It to dwell inthe Jerusalem Temple (1 Kings 8:27)? While kavod, a “limited version” of God,may answer this question, anything to do with the notion of God’s glory sooneror later stumbles over its paradoxical nature. To wit, Isaiah overhears angelsdeclaring that “God’s glory fills the entire world” (Isa. 6:3).Enigmatically, when God creates humans, He says: Let us make man in our image,after our likeness (Gen. 1:26). To forestall an anthropomorphic interpretationof this phrase, the medieval Jewish philosophers suggest that this refers to areal, although not physical, resemblance. For example, man shares God’screativity, free will, and rationality.God Is HolyWhile the notion of holiness is enormously complex, the Hebrew word for it,kadosh, provides some insight into how the Hebrew Bible understands it. Thethree-letter root K-D-Sh implies such ideas as separation from the profane,mundane, and everyday. It is sacred, hallowed, and sanctified.Isaiah hears the angels in his vision say: Holy, holy, holy is YHVH of Hosts(Isa. 6:3). And God’s name itself is holy (Ps. 33:21).image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTSiggie, in his early thirties and one of several Jewish volunteers, worked in aresidential school for disturbed children. He described his overall impressionof his DMT session: There’s a certain holiness to it.Direct Perception of God Is Incompatible with LifeOne possible and extreme conclusion regarding the fundamental dichotomy betweenholiness and the ordinary is that direct contact with God is incompatible withlife. We previously read that direct perception of God’s glory may kill (Exod.33:20). Despite this, we never find that someone viewing God or an angelactually dies. Rather, there is surprise at still being alive, as Jacob notedafter wrestling all night with an angel (Gen. 32:31).image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTGerald may have been referring to this threat: It seemed potentially dangerousto venture into it unless you were versed in how to handle it.God Is ZealousAn attribute of God we read about in the Hebrew Bible is “jealous” or“zealous.”*99 [part0037.html#ft99] Both terms refer to an intense commitment toa particular thing: a person, nation, belief, or practice. When somethingsunders or threatens to sunder that relationship, adverse consequences result.The term usually appears in connection with God’s “feelings” about idolatry inits various forms (Exod. 20:5).WHAT GOD DOESProvidence is the term we use to express the relationship between God and thephenomenal world. God created and sustains the world by means of providence,including its moral and natural laws. The notion of homonymy also is critical inthis discussion. Recall, for instance, the biblical concept of God rewarding andpunishing that I discussed in chapter 7, God. The expression “God rewards”represents one way to label the end result of the operation of cause and effectthat regulates existence. “God rewards” is shorthand terminology that militatesagainst wrongheaded propositions such as “God is unaware of what we do,” “Godhas no power in this world,” or “God possesses no moral compass.” This is wherethe anthropomorphic notion of God’s providence proves useful. That is, if wereceived benefits (or suffering) for our actions from a person, we wouldinterpret them as reward (or punishment). While this “reward” or “punishment”simply reflects the operation of cause and effect, that cause and effect is setup in such a manner as to encourage certain beliefs and behaviors and todiscourage others.God Created and Sustains the Natural and Moral WorldsThe first words of the Hebrew Bible describe how God imposed the order ofnatural law upon preexisting chaos: In the beginning of God’s forming*100[part0037.html#ft100]the heavens and the earth . . . (Gen. 1:1).With respect to both the natural and moral worlds, God: forms light and createsdarkness, makes peace and creates evil (Isa. 45:7). God enlivens (Ps. 36:10) andkills (Deut. 32:39), created consciousness (Ps. 139:13) and the soul (Isa.57:16), and placed these into His creations on earth (Isa. 42:5). God createdthe means of communicating, such as eyes, ears, and the mouth (Exod. 4:11).image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTDMT volunteers also noted the process of creation. Roland spoke “for” God inthis excerpt: The first thing I created was chaos, the mother and father of allthings. It gives birth to the patterns and everything else.Volunteers described “slowing down” as a necessary stage in creation. Carlosexperienced himself as “the Creator” and then: watched the universe’s creationdown from fundamental mental energy to a vibratory rate to material things (DMT,230–31).God Exercises Justice and RighteousnessGod is the ultimate judge because He is omniscient and has the power to judge: IYHVH search the heart, test the will in order to give to each person accordingto his ways, the fruit of his deeds (Jer. 17:10).The rewards for living in accordance with God’s guidelines are manifold:spiritual benefits such as achieving closeness to God (Amos 5:14), attaining Hislove (Gen. 18:19), realizing the knowledge (Jer. 22:16) and awe (Deut. 6:2) ofGod, and acquiring prophecy (Ps. 17:15). The rewards also include a long life(Prov. 3:2), many descendants (Gen. 26:4), good health (Exod. 15:26), favorableweather (Deut. 11:14), and being a blessing to the world (Gen. 22:18).image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTElena’s experience countered the suggestion that God “searches” or “judges”: Itdoesn’t seek or impose.Ken alluded to the relationship between suffering and being punished in hishorrifying encounter with the reptilian beings: It was as if I were beingpunished (DMT, 252).God Loves, Comforts, and HealsWhile we never read in the Hebrew Bible that God is love, the text notes thatGod does love: for YHVH is good, for His loving-kindness is forever (Jer.33:11). God: loves the stranger to give him bread and garment (Deut. 10:18), andprovides comfort to the distraught (Isa. 57:15) and healing to the ill (Deut.32:39). His mercy extends to animals, as manifest in their having enough to eat(Ps. 147:9).image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTWhen Rex’s panic-stricken entry into the DMT state tested his faith, he came tothe realization that: all is God, and that God was love (DMT, 206).God Teaches and Instills WisdomWhile the highly abstract God of the medieval Jewish philosophers seems ratherremoved from the mundane human sphere, we encounter the opposite notion in theHebrew Bible itself. For example: I am YHVH your God, who teaches you for yourbenefit (Isa. 48:17). In particular, He teaches those most capable of learning(Dan. 2:21).image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTIn the prophetic milieu, Heather might have been referring to God: Maybe it wastrying to teach me something (DMT, 179).God TestsGod sets challenges before humanity, especially regarding one’s faith in It.Abraham passes such a test by simply agreeing to sacrifice Isaac, his son, afterGod requests that he do so. The willingness is sufficient (Gen. 22:16–17), andIsaac lives through the ordeal. Similarly, God feeds the Hebrews manna for fortyyears in the wilderness to teach them that It, and only It, provides sustenance(Deut. 8:3).God Responds to EntreatiesGod’s power and will allow Him to “relent” in a “merciful” manner. Theseexpressions refer to how He may, as the creator and sustainer of the laws ofcause and effect, modify their strict application in cases in which “punishment”would normally occur. A more modern “scientific” iteration of God’s relentingrelates to a certain degree of “uncertainty” regarding the operation of causeand effect.2 [part0038.html#fn66] That is, one need not evoke a non-naturalexplanation for the uncertainty that attaches to particular outcomes devolvingfrom particular antecedents. This “scientific” explanation, however, simplyexplains how God may bend the rules of cause and effect, not why the possibilityof such bending exists in the first place.The text expresses the notion that repentance—admitting to a wrong, promisingnot to repeat it, making restitution when possible—may effect God’s relenting:Return to Me, and I will return to you, says YHVH (Mal. 3:7). In a relatedmanner, God may relent in response to people changing their behavior by becomingmore merciful and just (Jer. 7:5–7), through confession (Isa. 57:16), andsuffering exile (Lev. 26:34).GUIDELINES FOR LIVING: PROPER RELATIONSHIPSThis material begins introducing us to the practical applications of theknowledge one obtains in the prophetic state. To the extent that the propheticand DMT states resemble each other, the guidelines that the Hebrew Bible laysdown may have relevance to the drug experience. That is, they may providevaluable direction in developing a Western model for a way of life thatresonates more closely with one’s psychedelic sensibilities.In the introduction to this chapter, I present the idea that knowledge of Godleads to particular ethical behavior based on that knowledge. For example, ifGod loves the stranger or hates idolatry, then by loving the stranger or hatingidolatry, we are emulating God. Emulating God is one way to establish a closerrelationship with It. By following certain guide lines we partake in God’sholiness: You are to sanctify yourselves*101 [part0037.html#ft101] and you shallbecome holy, for I am holy (Lev. 11:44).The basis of a Godly life is knowing the difference between right and wrong, orin biblical terms, between good and evil, that which ultimately avails and thatwhich ultimately does not. Sometimes we can make that determination using commonsense or rational deliberation. At other times the Hebrew Bible suggests we needrevealed guidance. Isaiah chastises those who make up their morality as it suitsthem, equating this behavior with a denial of reality: Woe to those who speak ofevil as good and of good as evil, who make darkness as light and light asdarkness, who make bitter as sweet and sweet as bitter (Isa. 5:20).The revelation at Mount Sinai is replete with somatic, emotional, perceptual,and other properties of the prophetic state. More important, there the Hebrewnation learned certain things about God’s nature, how to optimize theirrelationship with It, and how to optimize their relationships with their innerand outer worlds. The climax of the revelation is Moses receiving the TenCommandments, what we might consider a distillation of the entire propheticmessage. They first appear in chapter 20 of Exodus, and they appear again inchapter 5 of Deuteronomy with minor variations. The first subset of the TenCommandments contains guidelines for relating to God. The second subset concernssocial relations. I will begin with the former.Relating to God1. I am YHVH your God [Elohim] (Exod. 20:2). YHVH exists, and is Elohim, thecreator of heaven and earth. This fixes in the mind a belief, not a specificbehavior.2. You shall have no other gods before Me (Exod. 20:3). There is only one God.2a. You shall not make yourself a carved image nor any likeness of that which isin the heavens above or on the earth below or in the water beneath the earth(Exod. 20:4). Don’t make idols.2b. You shall not prostrate yourself to them nor worship them (Exod. 20:5).Don’t bow before idols or the spiritual forces they represent or contain.3. You shall not take the name of YHVH your God in vain (Exod. 20:7).Contemptuously and falsely swearing by God diminishes Its stature on earth.4. Remember the Sabbath day to sanctify it (Exod. 20:8). This is a reminder thatGod created the heavens and the earth and then ceased from creation, and thatGod took the Hebrews out of Egypt. God also enjoins us, our workers, and ourbeasts of burden to rest on the Sabbath.IN ONE’S ATTITUDEThe primary feelings toward God that the Hebrew Bible attempts to inculcate arelove (Deut. 6:5), knowledge (Exod. 6:7), closeness (Deut. 13:5), and awe (Deut.10:12). Awe of God is one way to attain knowledge of It (Prov. 2:5). Inaddition, awe and love conduce to obedience. For example, Abraham obeys God’scommand to uproot himself from his family at the age of seventy-five and travelto a destination that God will reveal to him only after he has arrived (Gen.12:1).image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTSimilarly, Cal received a call to journey. Note how in this excerpt a relationalissue occurs regarding the quality of communication between the being and Cal:There was some guy there speaking in English so I could understand it. He said,“Go to Chaco Canyon.”*102 [part0037.html#ft102]He repeated it and told me torepeat it three or four times to make sure that I remembered it.RITUAL AND PRAYERThe Hebrew Bible recommends certain practices, rites, and rituals that increasecloseness to God. Some are effective when priests in their official capacityperform them on behalf of the community, and others require individualperformance. Offerings are one example, and these include sacrifices, donations,and loans—of animals, agricultural products, valued possessions, money, or land.The crucial variable affecting the efficacy of any ritual is sincerity, whichthe text defines as following God’s guidance in other areas of one’s life. Infact, the Hebrew Bible equates oppressing the disadvantaged with idol worship(Jer. 7:6). That is, worshipping God in one’s prayers while not being charitableis as if one were actually worshipping the idols of wealth and possessions andnot the charitable and loving God. Rather, God desires: loving-kindness and notsacrifices, and knowledge of God more than burnt offerings (Hosea 6:6).Insincerity negates the efficacy of prayer (Isa. 29:13), as does acute alcoholintoxication (Lev. 10:9). Rituals one directs at any entity other than God alsoare ineffective (Isa. 44:9).Prayer is another form of ritual, in which one may petition for things, such ashealing or salvation (Jer. 17:14), or express praise and thanksgiving (1 Chron.16:8–10). Prayer may effectively substitute for ritual sacrifice (Ps. 141:2).image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTResearch subjects rarely explicitly prayed. Heather addressed a God-likepresence in her vision: Show me, oh powerful one.STUDYING NATUREOne may know God, and thus approach Him, by studying His works. Job advises: Askthe beasts and they will instruct you, the birds of the sky and they will tellyou. Or, speak with the earth and it will teach you, the fish of the sea willtell you (Job 12:7–8).Relating to the World: The Golden RuleA proper relationship with the world is tantamount to knowledge of God, as welearn from the prophet who bemoans the absence of both among the people andtheir rulers: There is neither truth nor loving-kindness nor knowledge of God inthe land (Hosea 4:1).The second subset of the Ten Commandments thus concerns our relationships witheverything “other than” God: ourselves, other people, and the natural world.5. Honor your father and your mother (Exod. 20:12). Your parents are partnerswith God in your creation.6. You shall not murder (Exod. 20:13). Wanton murder is prohibited.7. You shall not commit adultery (Exod. 20:13). People shouldn’t be unfaithfulto each other.8. You shall not steal (Exod. 20:13). Stealing deprives others of what isrightfully theirs and often leads to swearing falsely.9. You shall not bear false witness against your fellow (Exod. 20:13). This is aprohibition against lying, as well as gossip.10. You shall not covet your fellow’s house. You shall not covet your fellow’swife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, noranything that belongs to your fellow (Exod. 20:14). This is the only prohibitionagainst a feeling and not an overt behavior.This set of statements finds its distillation in the “Golden Rule,” which inturn derives from love. Love is the antidote to hatred, the emotion with whichthe introduction to the seminal verse opens: You shall not hate your brother inyour heart. . . . You shall not take revenge and you shall not bear a grudgeagainst the members of your people; you shall love your fellow as yourself—I amYHVH (Lev. 19:17–18).Several medieval Jewish commentators note that the wording of the Golden Rulepoints to its revealed nature. While it may be possible to rationally deducemuch of the prophetic message, when the text adds the words “I am YHVH” to theend of a precept, it appears to be emphasizing that rational thought alone couldnot lead to it.*103 [part0037.html#ft103]One may derive many corollaries from the Golden Rule: “Don’t do to your fellowwhat you don’t want done to you,” “Don’t do to yourself what you wouldn’t wantyour fellow to do to you,” “Love yourself as you wish your fellow to love you,”“Treat your fellow as you would like him or her to treat you,” and others.Empathy plays an enormously important role in understanding and applying theGolden Rule, as we read when God states: Do not oppress a stranger. You know thefeelings of a stranger, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt (Exod.23:9).image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTAllan referred to the Golden Rule and its basis in empathy when he saw angryHispanic young men in his vision and told them: If you hate me, you hateyourself. . . . Their culture, our culture, they were co-real, existingsimultaneously (DMT, 180).APPLICATIONS OF THE GOLDEN RULEGeneral ApplicationsThe Hebrew Bible establishes general categories of proper behavior: practicingrighteousness, charity, and love, and shunning unrighteousness and hatred. Godtells Isaiah: Cease to do evil, learn to do good, aid the wronged, uphold therights of the orphan, take up the grievance of the widow (Isa. 1:16–17). Seekingpeace is an especially high priority, as when the psalmist preaches to “seekpeace and pursue it” (Ps. 34:15).image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTI previously noted how the beings charged Brenda with “embracing peace” (DMT,214).Specific ApplicationsThe Hebrew Bible contains a vast number—Maimonides lists 613—of specific lawsthat address the multitudinous exigencies of daily life using its particularmoral compass.4 [part0038.html#fn68] In the pursuit of peace, it condemns gossipand slander (Ps. 34:14). In honoring our creator, it eschews self-mutilation(Lev. 19:28) and maladaptive intoxication (Isa. 5:11). The text spells outspecific health-related regulations, including dietary ones (Lev. 11), that areconducive to having the closest possible relationship with God. These latterprecepts include, among others, avoiding the consumption of blood, which theHebrew Bible identifies with an animal’s soul or life (Lev. 17:14).image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTGerald received a specific pointer regarding his health: There was a verbalmessage that I got, directing me to work with my nasal congestion.image [../images/00009.jpeg] PROPHECYThe text teaches compassion to animals; for example, mandating that we chaseaway the mother bird before collecting her eggs for food (Deut. 22:6–7) and thatwe not cook a kid in its mother’s milk (Exod. 34:26).Several laws expand on the general prohibition against stealing: respectingproperty boundary lines (Deut. 19:14) and maintaining honest weights in themarketplace (Deut. 25:15). In fact, dishonest weights are “an abomination toGod” (Deut. 25:16), the same expression the text uses to describe idol worshipand its practices, up to and including child sacrifice (Deut. 12:31). Lendingserves as a corrective against greed (Deut. 15:7–8). While the Hebrew Biblecondones slavery, it sets time limits to enslavement: He shall work for sixyears and in the seventh he shall go free (Exod. 21:2).With respect to the administration of a nation, we learn that a prophet shouldanoint the king (1 Kings 19:15), and the latter should not enrich himselfthrough his office (Deut. 17:16). When waging war, the military must accept thepeaceful surrender of its foes (Deut. 20:10– 11). God tells the Hebrews toappoint “judges and officers” throughout the land (Deut. 16:18) to ensure thegreatest possible degree of righteousness and justice.SUMMARYThis first chapter comparing the information content of the prophetic and DMTstates demonstrates how much more complex, sophisticated, and voluminous is theprophetic message relative to the DMT one. When the two sets of data do addressthe same or similar issues, volunteers’ statements generally resemble those inthe Hebrew Bible. For example, both point to similar qualities of God, or aGod-like presence, such as Its power, creativity, and holiness. Volunteers alsoalluded, albeit rather indistinctly, to a Godly force’s involvement with theworld, including such notions as loving, punishing, charging, and instructing.However, they spoke relatively little about moral principles, ethical teachings,or practical guidelines for living, such as the Hebrew Bible’s benchmark GoldenRule and the numerous precepts that devolve from it."},{"pageContent":"18Message and Meaning IIHistory, the World to Come, the Messiah, Resurrection, False Prophecy, Wisdom,and PoetryThe Hebrew Bible teaches that God guides human affairs across the entirespectrum of history, on a scale that ranges from the individual to the globaland even cosmic. Thus, the past is the fulfillment of God’s will. This is thesource of the paradoxical notion of history as fulfilled prophecy; or to stateit more precisely, that history reflects accurate prophetic foretelling. Thepast as well as the future reveal God’s “hand” in history: The Lord YHVH-Godwill not do anything unless He has revealed His secret to His servants theprophets (Amos 3:7).The accuracy of prophetic foretelling, however, is not as cut and dry as it mayseem, as many biblical predictions clearly have never taken place.1[part0038.html#fn69] As a result, there are many theories regarding the arena inwhich prophetic predictions reside, if that arena is not actual history quahistory. Perhaps predictions are simply metaphors and teach theology; forexample, that God is eternal and rewards and punishes according to one’s deeds.Or predictions that haven’t yet materialized may do so in the relatively distantfuture. Or the fulfillment of certain foretellings is happening now or will inthe extremely near future.2 [part0038.html#fn70]Taking into account this caveat regarding the ambiguity of propheticpredictions, I have adopted a particular approach to categorizing them. Theprimary criterion is how far in the future they apply. “Almost-immediate”predictions deal with hours to days, as when God tells Samuel to expect Saul thenext day (1 Sam. 9:16), or as in Joseph’s accurate dream interpretationregarding the fate of his two fellow prisoners in an Egyptian jail (Gen. 41:13).An example of an almost-immediate prediction in a DMT volunteer occurred withBrenda: It (he) is trying to tell me I will see something. But what? I try toask, “Will I know it when I see it?” The presence tells me I will see something(DMT, 212). This example also illustrates how impaired communication interfereswith the apprehension of the information that the DMT state contains.“Near-term” predictions fall within months to years, as when Joseph interpretsPharaoh’s dreams as indicating years of plenty and years of famine (Gen.41:25–31). “Long-term” predictions occupy a time span of decades to generations,in which case we begin losing specificity and sensitivity. An example is Moses’sprediction of the Israelites’ exile from their land (Deut. 28:64). While thisevent occurred several hundred years after the conquest of Canaan, Moses’sprediction lacked any temporal precision. “Very long-term” predictions are themost confusing regarding when they will occur, among whom, and where.The World to ComeThe notion of very long-term predictions, what the text often refers to as “atthat time,” leads us into eschatology, which my dictionary defines as: “Thebranch of theology that treats of death, resurrection, immortality, the end ofthe world, final judgment, and the future state.”3 [part0038.html#fn71] Thevagueness of statements regarding when this end will occur provides the basisfor the belief that that time may be in the remote future or may occur at anymoment. The paradox of the inconceivably remote future being a heartbeat away ispart and parcel of the confusion and hope that such a concept elicits. TheHebrew Bible conveys a sense of the enormity of this radical shift ofcircumstances, as for example when Daniel’s angel calls it “the end” (Dan. 8:17)and Jacob on his deathbed refers to “the end of days” (Gen. 49:1).As my study of the Hebrew Bible progressed, the nature of this future worldincreasingly drew my attention. This is because of how similar many of itsproperties appear to those of the DMT state. I began to consider how endogenousDMT may play a role in this phenomenon, and it is for that reason I describe the“future world” in as much detail as I do below.TRANSITION PHASEBetween this world and the next, a momentous and unpleasant transition is oftenpredicted, which then evolves into a beatific state: For that day is great, withnone like it, and it is a time of distress for Jacob, through which he shall besaved (Jer. 30:7). Its onset may be sudden (Mal. 3:1), and a loud noise mayaccompany it: I will whistle to them and gather them (Zech. 10:8). Thesecharacteristics are comparable to what we have already encountered in themovement between the normal waking state and either the DMT or prophetic one.OVERWHELMING SENSE OF REALITYGod tells Isaiah how our current reality will pale in comparison to the new one,so much so that the old will fade from memory: For behold, I am creating newheavens and a new earth, and the first ones shall not be remembered, neithershall they come into mind (Isa. 65:17). The psalmist predicts that the past willseem like a dream (Ps. 126:1).DIFFERENT LAWS OF NATURESome descriptions of the new reality focus on changes in the natural world: Theheavens shall vanish like smoke, and the earth shall rot away like a garment(Isa. 51:6). The light of this new world is preternaturally intense: The lightof the moon will be like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will beseven times as strong—like the light of seven days (Isa. 30:26).The human body becomes more highly perfected. All physical ailments anddisabilities cease (Isa. 35:5–6) and childbirth becomes painless (Isa. 66:7).Human nature becomes more sublime: war ceases (Hosea 2:20) and “sorrow andsighing flee” (Isa. 51:11). God will change human nature in order to increaseour love of and closeness to Him: YHVH your God will remove the barrier of yourheart*104 [part0037.html#ft104]and the heart of your offspring, to love YHVHyour God with all your heart and with all your soul (Deut. 30:6). It is a timeof boundless joy: The righteous will be glad, exult before God, and rejoice withgladness (Ps. 68:4). Most striking, everyone from the highest to the least willprophesy. Joel, a Second Temple–era prophet, predicts: Your sons and daughtersshall prophesy, your elders shall dream dreams, your young men shall seevisions. Even also upon the slaves and the maidservants in those days I shallpour out My spirit (Joel 3:1–2).image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTThe notion of a future world also appeared in some of the DMT volunteers’reports. William described learning of a better “world to come”: I feltevolution occurring. These intelligences are looking over us. There is hopebeyond the mess we are making for ourselves (DMT, 193).Rex saw a new type of “loving and sensual” hive-like human dwelling: [The being]said to me that this is where your future lay (DMT, 210).Roland referred to a world in which conversing with God will be the norm:There’s a barrier between us and the divine; we made it; it’s not real; if itweren’t there God could talk to us like we talk to each other.Willow intimated that such a rarified state must be incorporeal: There is nolimit to love except the body. She also referred to its utterly sublime nature:If we all knew what was waiting for us, we’ d all kill ourselves (DMT, 225).Resurrection and Eternal LifeThe Hebrew Bible offers inconsistent hints regarding its views on eternal life,resurrection, the soul’s survival after death, and rebirth. Daniel’s angel tellshim: Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth will awaken (Dan. 12:2).This notion of resurrection provides the medieval Jewish philosophers with asolution to theodicy—seemingly unjustifiable suffering or success—as the secondhalf of this verse in Daniel indicates what will occur after resurrection: someto eternal life; others to reproaches, to everlasting abhorrence (Dan. 12:2).However, the author of Ecclesiastes remarks about the dead: nor will they everagain have a share in whatever is done under the sun*105 [part0037.html#ft105](Eccles. 9:6).The medieval Jewish philosophers offer a compromise position by suggesting thatdeath is permanent in this world of normal, natural law. However, when the newworld comes into being with different laws of nature, death is more malleable.Job captures the essence of this solution: A man lies down and does not rise.They do not awaken until the heavens are no more; only then, aroused from theirsleep (Job 14:12).image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTWillow referred to the seeming deathlessness of her disembodied existence:Eternity is an attribute of that place. It would have to be (DMT, 226).Elena remarked on her own rebirth: I have practiced dying and returning (DMT,222).Brenda saw how rebirth might occur: The essence of who I am was alone in thevoid, back in the staging area for life where souls wait to incarnate (DMT,212).The MessiahThe prophetic message contains references to a herald, most likely human, of thetransition from this world to the next. That person also may be that world’ssovereign. Specifics vary among the medieval Jewish philosophers regarding thenature of this “messiah.” The word itself derives from a three-letter Hebrewroot, M-Sh-Ch, that means “to anoint” or “smear with oil.” Prophets anoint andthus sanctify their successors, as well as kings, priests, and the structuresand implements of the sacrificial service. It is of note that while DMTvolunteers described certain qualities of the “future world,” none referred tothe notion of a messianic figure.The Hebrew Bible predicts that the messiah will be a prophet (Isa. 11:2); wise,heroic, mighty, understanding, and reverent (Isa. 11:2–3); and a universalleader (Isa. 49:6). His success is certain, as God tells the prophet: Behold, Myservant will succeed (Isa. 52:13). Maimonides suggests that the messiah willappear around the time of the resurrection and will oversee an era of greatpeace, the ingathering of all Jews to Israel, universal worship of YHVH, andextraordinary longevity. He also posits that the era of the messiah will be aprelude to the soul’s eternal life in a discarnate state.4 [part0038.html#fn72]FALSE PROPHETS AND FALSE PROPHECYThe legitimacy of prophets and their messages is an issue that troubled peopleof biblical times, and has continued as a concern to the religious formillennia, and is also relevant to the contemporary psychedelic drug experience.That is, how do we determine the truth value of our own or someone else’sspiritual encounter?The Hebrew Bible clearly states that there are true and false prophets; forexample, when God compares the true prophet to “wheat” and the false prophet to“chaff” (Jer. 23:28). While it may be clear to God, Moses recognizes our ownstruggle to make such a distinction when he predicts that prophets will ariseafter he dies, and the people will ask: How can we know the word that YHVH hasnot spoken? (Deut. 18:21).Contributing to this ambiguity, we find that when the Hebrew Bible discusses“false” prophets, it nearly always employs the word “prophet” withoutqualification. There are times, however, when it does specify false prophets as“prophets of the lie” (Jer. 23:26). The Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible,the Septuagint, uses the word pseudoprophetes in several places, thus providingus with some additional guidelines in specific contexts.5 [part0038.html#fn73]The Hebrew Bible proposes several criteria for differentiating true prophecyfrom false. These include (1) the presence or absence of confirmatory “signs,”such as miracles or the accuracy of a prediction; (2) the character of theprophet; (3) the source of the message; and (4) the message itself. However, asI will demonstrate, for every example of a criterion’s utility, we find otherexamples that militate against it.SignsFailure to bring about a promised sign may indicate a false prophet: If theprophet will speak in the name of YHVH, and that thing will not occur and notcome about, that is the word that YHVH has not spoken (Deut. 18:22). However,the text also points out that even if the prediction comes true, the content ofthe message—for example, encouraging people to serve idols—indicates that theprophet is false (Deut. 13:2–6).CharacterConviction may vouch for a prophet’s authenticity. The true prophet Michaiahannounces: As YHVH lives, that which YHVH will say to me, that will I speak (1Kings 22:14). Hananiah the false prophet also believes he speaks in the name of“YHVH of Hosts, the God of Israel” (Jer. 28:2), but his predictions do notmaterialize, and his advice is faulty.False prophets are greedy (Mic. 3:5), whereas true prophets refuse payment (2Kings 5:16). Nevertheless, Solomon, who experiences prophecy, amassesunimaginable wealth and burdens his country with staggering taxes and forcedlabor to construct both the Temple and his private palace (1 Kings 5:6, 27–30).False prophets are adulterers (Jer. 29:23). However, David commits adultery withthe wife of a man whom he then sends to the front lines to ensure his death (2Sam. 11). False prophets are alcohol abusers (Isa. 28:7), but we read in Genesishow Noah the prophet drank himself into an indecent stupor (Gen. 9:21).False prophets lie, as in the case of a particular false prophet who entices atrue one (1 Kings 13:18), which results in the latter’s death. However, trueprophets also lie, as when Isaac tells his neighbors that his wife is only hissister (Gen. 26:7). In a related vein, a true prophet’s advice may not beprophetic. Nathan, David’s court prophet, tells him that God is “with him” inhis desire to build a Temple. Later that night, in a true prophetic dream, Godinforms Nathan otherwise (2 Sam. 7:3, 13).True prophets are humble. The text describes Moses as the “humblest man in theworld” (Num. 12:3). However, he regularly berates the Hebrew nation in anger(Num. 20:10), and his impetuousness precludes his entering Canaan with them(Num. 20:12), even after forty years of faithful stewardship in the wilderness.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTWith respect to the personal characteristic of humility, Brenda noted: I guess Idon’t feel comfortable in my role as an earthly spiritual emissary (DMT, 215).MessageA “false” message bespeaks the falsity of the prophet who delivers it, while thefalsity of the message is proportionate to how much it deviates from the HebrewBible’s guidelines. For example, false prophets encourage drunkenness (Mic.2:11) and promise salvation to the unrepentant (Jer. 23:14). However, while thetrue prophet’s message is often disturbing (Jer. 1:10), he or she may alsopreach unconditional salvation and consolation (Isa. 60:1), just as do falseprophets.Varieties of False ProphecyOne species of false prophet speaks for idols, what the text refers to as “thegods of others,” rather than for God (Deut. 18:20). Another relies on divinationor magical practices rather than inspiration, as in the case of the king ofBabylonia who: shot arrows, inquired of the teraphim,*106[part0037.html#ft106]and looked into the liver†107 [part0037.html#ft107] (Ezek.21:26). However, divination may be accurate, as Jacob’s avaricious father-in-lawLaban tells him: I have learned by divination that YHVH has blessed me onaccount of you (Gen. 30:27). Astrology is another form of divination that theHebrew Bible considers false: the stargazers who foretell by new moons aboutwhat will happen to you (Isa. 47:13).The Hebrew Bible suggests that one can recognize false prophecy when it isplagiary, the product of: those who steal My words from one another (Jer.23:30). However, true prophets may plagiarize. Compare Isaiah’s description ofthe person and reign of the messiah with Micah’s:He shall judge between the nations and reprove many peoples. They shall beattheir swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks; nation willnot lift sword against nation, and they will no longer study warfare. (Isa. 2:4)He will judge between many peoples and will reprove mighty nations far away.They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruninghooks; nation will not lift the sword against nation, and they will no longerstudy warfare. (Mic. 4:3)Societal ResponseMany of the missionary prophets, those whose prophetic experience compels themto preach, neither pursue nor relish their role because of the reactions totheir message in their target audiences. True prophecy often causes nearlypathognomonic*108 [part0037.html#ft108] responses in those who receive it. Thisis due to the message’s admonishing and chastising content as well as its direpredictions. The text refers to prophecy as a “weight” or “burden” (Zech. 9:1;Mal. 1:1). The emotional, interpersonal, and physical strains are crushing, andmany called to a prophetic mission attempt to avoid it.6 [part0038.html#fn74]The true prophet may receive physical abuse (Isa. 50:6) or death threats (Jer.11:21), or people may simply shun and ignore the prophet (Jer. 25:3). In fact,people usually prefer false prophecy, as Isaiah laments their request: Speak tous with smooth talk (Isa. 30:10).WISDOMThe books that make up the Hebrew Bible’s formal wisdom literature are Proverbs,Job, and Ecclesiastes, although wisdom courses through the entire text. Thesebooks contain very little, if any, legal, historical, or narrative content.Instead, they emphasize theological and ethical issues, and lead to a clearerknowledge of God as well as help us attain well-being, dignity, and decency inthis life. There are no visions in Proverbs and Ecclesiastes, only succinctobservations and advice, and the Book of Job is nearly entirely a dialogue abouttheodicy. The wisdom books of the Hebrew Bible possess a degree ofsophistication that matches anything one might encounter in the Eastern wisdomtraditions; for example, Proverbs lists eleven types of wisdom or wiseindividual and six types of folly or foolish person.7 [part0038.html#fn75]In the spirit of a wisdom text, the Hebrew Bible opens by directly addressingwhether creation is good or bad. This heads off any potential sense ofdisheartenment, nihilism, or weariness regarding this world. And God saw allthat He had made, and behold, it was very good (Gen. 1:31).image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTGabe confirmed this positive viewpoint: [The beings] were saying that life wasgood (DMT, 190).We Determine the Quality of Our LivesThe Hebrew Bible establishes early on its teaching about self-determination whendescribing the delicate balance between doing good and doing evil, a decisionover which we generally exert free will. Cain is angry that God accepted hisbrother Abel’s sacrifice and not his own. In response, God tells Cain: Surely ifyou improve yourself, you will be forgiven. But if you do not improve yourself,sin rests at the door. Its desire is toward you, yet you can conquer it (Gen.4:7).image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTAndrea encapsulated the results of not “improving oneself ”: Humans and I arejust plodding along, not going anywhere.Wisdom’s Nature and ValueWisdom predates creation. It says of itself: I was created when there were yetno deeps (Prov. 8:24). Wisdom is theocentric: Let not the wise man glorifyhimself with his wisdom. . . . For only with this may one glorify himself:contemplating and knowing Me (Jer. 9:22–23); ethical: Behold, the awe of my Lordis wisdom, refraining from evil is understanding (Job 28:28); and consists inknowing the value of seeking it: The beginning of wisdom [is to] acquire wisdom,and with all your possessions acquire understanding (Prov. 4:7).image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTUsing the Greek term for the intelligent order that regulates existence, Allanreported perceiving: the Logos, . . . the core of meaning and semantics (DMT,179).Limits to Human KnowledgeThe Hebrew Bible’s position is that our ability to understand God’s wisdom isnot sufficient for the task. Solomon suggests that our very nature precludesattaining ultimate knowledge: [God] has also put an enigma into their minds sothat man cannot comprehend God’s work that He did from beginning to end (Eccles.3:11). God tells Isaiah that our use of the term “wisdom” is only homonymous inrelation to His: For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My wayshigher than your ways and My thoughts [higher] than your thoughts (Isa. 55:9).In addition, our inability to fathom God’s wisdom is at the root of the problemof theodicy, as we read in the concluding chapters of the book of Job.image [../images/00009.jpeg] DMTElena commented on the limited ability of her conceptual knowledge to grasp theessence of existence: There was no benevolent god, only this primordial power.All of my ideas and beliefs seemed absurdly ridiculous (DMT, 240).POETRYWe usually equate the Book of Psalms and the Song of Songs with biblical poetry.However, several other songs appear in the Hebrew Bible. They all provide alyrical mode of prayer—petitioning, praising, giving thanks, or expressing love.Psalm 23 probably is the most popular:YHVH is my shepherd, I shall not lack. In lush meadows He lays me down, besidetranquil waters He leads me. He restores my soul. He leads me on paths ofrighteousness for His name’s sake. Though I walk in the valley overshadowed bydeath, I fear no evil, for You are with me. Your rod and Your staff, theycomfort me. You prepare a table before me in view of my tormentors. You anointedmy head with oil, my cup overflows.COMPARING MESSAGES OF THE HEBREW BIBLE AND BUDDHISMTraditional Buddhism teaches that there is no God external to us, one with whomour self attains a deeper and more highly developed relationship in thespiritual state. Instead, one reaches the goal of enlightenment bydeconstructing that self and thereby experiencing absolute identification withan imageless, formless, and concept-free state of “emptiness.” The emptiness ofenlightenment lacks any attributes, teaches no precepts, and possesses nopersonality, expectations, nor feelings.Ethical–moral precepts do play a role in Buddhist practice, but they resultfrom, rather than make up the essence of, the spiritual experience. In my Zencommunity, the three basic precepts were: (1) cease from evil, (2) do only good,and (3) do good for others. While these comport with the prophetic message, theyrepresent an enlightened response to reality rather than constitute the messageof enlightenment itself, because enlightenment by definition contains nomessage.Buddhist ethics developed after the core enlightenment experience of the Buddha.He returned, as it were, with certain knowledge; for example, that there is noabiding self in the mind-body complex, that everyday existence is impermanentand therefore an improper relationship with it begets suffering. Therefore,deconstructing our relationship with the phenomenal world leads to inner peace.Buddhist interactive-relational guidelines, such as acting charitably, aresecondary, not intrinsic, to a higher-order a-relational mystical-unitiveexperience.In prophecy, there exists the maintenance and even intensification of one’s selfin a highly dynamic and interactive relationship with a speaking, feeling,acting, and teaching God. Through prophecy, God communicates specific guidelinesfor beliefs and behavior that are consistent with the natural and moral laws Hecreated and sustains. The prophetic experience is full of intelligibleinformation, not devoid of it. The message, not its absence, is the soul ofprophecy—its essential feature.SUMMARYThis chapter has compared the informational content of the prophetic and DMTstates with respect to God’s role in history, as well as the world to come, themessiah, resurrection, false prophecy, poetry, and wisdom. As in the previouschapter, the degree of overlap is not especially impressive. Prediction,especially near- to long-term, is virtually absent in the DMT experiencecompared with the prophetic one. And while eschatological elements appear inboth states, those of prophecy are much more highly articulated. However, it isof great interest that biblical descriptions of the world to come sharephenomenological properties with the DMT state. These common characteristicshave led me to consider the role of endogenous DMT in the “eschaton,” and I willdiscuss this issue in chapter 20, The Metaphysics of DMT.I have addressed at some length the notion of false prophecy. I believe it isnecessary to keep this phenomenon in mind if and when we use the information andideas in this book to attempt a renaissance of contemporary propheticexperience. We must approach any such effort with utmost care, within both thereligious and the psychiatric/ psychedelic communities, to minimize falseprophecy’s potential for adding more, rather than less, confusion andmisunderstanding to our world.While the DMT experience and prophecy appear to open the door to a very similarphenomenological universe—sights, sounds, feelings, and so on—it is less clearwhether they open the door to the same theological and moral ones. In prophecy,especially that type we associate with the canonical prophets, there isinformation that consists of beautiful language, ideas, and guidelines forliving that have shaped Western civilization for thousands of years. While theinformation contained in moments of inspiration and insight in the drug stateusually are consistent with those of prophecy, the message of the DMT experiencedoes not begin to approach the prophetic one’s breadth, depth, complexity, andprofundity. And even in the case of non-canonical prophets, the truth value andrelevance of the message they receive is far greater than that which the DMTvolunteers return with.At the same time, it may be that we are only now beginning to see a greaterinfluence of the psychedelic “message” in the non-aesthetic worlds. In chapter17, I referred to the development of transpersonal psychology as an intellectualresponse to the influx of psychedelic and Eastern religious sensibilities intoWestern culture in the 1960s. More recently, there is evidence for a similareffect on the disciplines of modern physics8 [part0038.html#fn76] and personalcomputing.9 [part0038.html#fn77] I remain uncertain, however, whether suchdevelopments are truly non-aesthetic. More precisely, do these developmentsprovide us with greater ethical and moral values or superior wisdom? Do theytruly represent the workings of a higher order or are they simply hypertrophiedmanifestations of the ordinary?How might we understand the discrepancy between the degree of resemblancebetween the two states’ phenomenology and their information content? Onepossible solution to this problem is that the DMT volunteers did indeed enterinto the same theological and moral worlds as do the prophets, but simply lackedthe relevant concepts and vocabulary to recognize, understand, and communicatethe information they contain. The alternative explanation is that the two statesonly superficially resemble each. One is true prophecy and the other is falseor, more accurately, a simulacrum or facsimile.This is a critical issue. If it simply is a matter of education and training, itis theoretically possible to make the prophetic experience more likely in thosewho seek it using psychedelic drugs. However, if the two sets of experiencesdiffer fundamentally, then no amount of training or education will lead to thecontemporary psychedelic drug state developing into true prophecy. These issueslead us to the investigation of the mechanisms underlying the prophetic and DMTexperiences, the topic that now follows. Can we, by understanding thosemechanisms, affect them in such a manner as to occasion true prophecy in ourtime?"},{"pageContent":"> Part IV> > Mechanisms: Spiritual and Material"},{"pageContent":"19The Metaphysics of ProphecyI have established in the preceding chapters that the prophetic and DMTexperiences share many phenomenological features. And while the informationalcontents—the messages—that the two states present are relatively comparable withrespect to their broadest outlines, the prophetic state’s is much greater inbreadth, depth, profundity, and impact. The two syndromes’ phenomenologicalresemblances suggest shared underlying mechanisms. The discrepancies in messagecontent point toward significant differences in how the two states develop.Understanding these processes, how they do and don’t resemble each other, willhelp us build more sophisticated models for understanding prophecy and the DMTexperiences. These new models then may lead to intriguing practicalapplications, such as attempting to experimentally elicit prophecy.In the next two chapters, I will engage in a dialectic between two perspectivesin order to explicate the mechanisms underlying the prophetic and DMT states.One is a spiritual-metaphysical model that takes prophecy as its referencepoint, and the other is a scientific-material model that takes DMT as itsreference point. In this chapter, I will treat spiritual mechanisms, themetaphysics of prophecy, especially as the medieval Jewish philosophers havewritten about them. In the next chapter, I will attempt to integrate what weknow about the DMT effect into these metaphysical theories.The medieval Jewish philosophers’ system of metaphysics constitutes asophisticated internally consistent model for understanding spiritualexperience. I also have found it extraordinarily useful for understanding theDMT effect. As this project has progressed and I learned more about themetaphysical processes operating in prophecy, I began to see how I had beenlimiting my idea of “similar underlying processes” in the two states to onlybiological ones. It appeared that similar metaphysical processes also were atwork. To the extent that the two sets of experiences overlap, they may share acommon metaphysics as well as a common biology.The metaphysical processes take place at levels that presently are objectivelyinvisible but whose effects are subjectively evident. The biological processesare objectively observable but not subjectively evident. In other words, wedirectly apprehend thoughts, feelings, sights, sounds, and other phenomena inour minds, but we do not apprehend the alterations in serotonin receptorfunction, for example, that underlie them. In contrast, we can objectivelymeasure effects on serotonin but not objectively measure our subjectiveexperience. An “explanatory gap” exists between biological processes and innerexperience. The medieval Jewish philosophers’ metaphysics provides a potentialbridge spanning that gap.The hallmark of this book’s theoneurological model is its placing spiritualmechanisms on at least equal footing in discussing mechanisms for how thesestates come about. Theoneurology proposes that God communicates with humansprophetically using the brain as the physical agent of communication. It is atop-down model, rather than a bottom-up neurotheological one.In neurotheology the brain “gives the impression” of communicating with God. Intheoneurology, the brain allows that process to take place through a processthat metaphysical theories help model. A theoneurological perspective provides auseful counterpoint to contemporary neurotheological models in its reversing thedirection of causality. By utilizing metaphysics, it attempts to integrate asophisticated religious worldview into a rigorously scientific one.RELEVANCE TO THE SCIENCE OF SPIRITUALITYContemporary research into spiritual experiences generally conflates all suchexperiences with the mystical-unitive type, resulting in its having become the“gold standard” for this research. A recent academic article1[part0038.html#fn78] listed contemporary research criteria for a “spiritualexperience”: unity, a noetic quality,*109 [part0037.html#ft109] and sacredness;a positive mood; the transcendence of time or space (or both); andineffability.†110 [part0037.html#ft110] However, by now it should be apparentthat these criteria fail to capture many of the salient properties of thehighest form of Hebrew biblical spirituality, prophecy, or of the DMT effect. Inthese interactive-relational syndromes we find the maintenance, if notenhancement, of one’s sense of self, a self that interacts fulsomely with thehighly articulated contents of the altered state. One enters into another world,rather than merging with pure experience, or even God Itself, and that otherworld is replete with processes and contents that occupy time and space.Finally, prophecy is rarely ecstatic and nearly always highly verbal.By restricting the definition of spiritual experience to the unitive-mysticaltype, we do two disservices to our investigation of the prophetic state and, byextension, to our investigation of the DMT one. First, by ranking theunitive-mystical syndrome higher than the interactive-relational experience,researchers are automatically ranking lower the benchmark spiritual experienceof the Hebrew Bible, the spiritual text that serves as a scriptural foundationfor half of the world population’s religious traditions. If current researchconsidered the two sets of experiences as equal, albeit qualitatively different,examining these differences would lead to a broader theoretical, biological, andpractical understanding of spirituality in its various forms. It also wouldprovide a more equitable theoretical foundation for using DMT, which elicits aninteractive-relational experience, to conduct serious inquiries into spiritualexperience. Because DMT effects are interactive-relational, one may argue thatits effects are somehow “inferior” to those resulting from administration ofcompounds that more reliably occasion a unitive-mystical one.2[part0038.html#fn79]Second, and in a consciously or unconsciously related manner, relegating tolower status the interactive-relational prophetic and DMT states allowsresearchers to dispense with the “embarrassing stigma”3 [part0038.html#fn80] ofboth, stigmata one can avoid when dealing solely with the nonverbal andcontent-free unitive-mystical state. In prophecy, these embarrassing stigmataare the beings and the prophetic message. The message contains ethical and moralvalues, and is transmitted by a God external to us. This God possesses specificattributes, holds expectations for our beliefs and behavior, and metes outreward and punishment according to our adherence to certain guidelines. In theDMT state, the embarrassing stigma is the presence of the beings, who seem toserve certain functions. It is much easier to sidestep both of these “problems”by focusing on the mystical-unitive experience, which is absent suchcontroversial content.MEDIEVAL METAPHYSICS: A BRIEF REVIEWIn general, the Hebrew Bible does not present a metaphysical model of prophecy.Instead, the text simply records that God or His angels appear to one or morehumans and say and do various things. The development of a systematicmetaphysics of prophecy awaited the medieval Jewish philosophers. Most of thesewriters agree on a general framework for how prophecy works.4[part0038.html#fn81]There are three pillars of prophecy: its source, its recipient, and the processof communication. I have already discussed the source of prophecy, God, in somedetail in chapter 7, from an abstract perspective, and in chapters 17 and 18,Message and Meaning I and II, I presented textual examples of those abstractnotions. In chapter 8, Prophet and Prophecy, I summarized characteristics ofthose who experience the prophetic state, as well as methods, training, andother factors that may conduce to its occurrence. The process of interactionbetween God and one experiencing prophecy I reviewed in chapter 15, Relatedness.However, for the discussion that follows, I’d like to briefly review andsynthesize the information the preceding chapters contained under the umbrellaof the medieval Jewish philosophers’ metaphysics, the system of spiritualobjects and processes that fill their intellectual and theological worlds. By sodoing, we’ll be better prepared to approach their theories explaining theoccurrence of prophecy and prophecy-like phenomena.For those medieval Jewish philosophers who believe that an incorporeal God doesnot interact directly with a corporeal world, “intermediaries” fill that role.The Hebrew Bible refers to this notion when it states that God: makes thewinds*111 [part0037.html#ft111]His messengers, the flaming fire His ministers(Ps. 104:4). Others believe that God does directly interact with the phenomenalworld. In either case, all the medieval Jewish philosophers posit an overflow,emanation, or efflux†112 [part0037.html#ft112] of divine influence from God orHis intermediaries‡113 [part0037.html#ft113] onto the natural world, includingthat of humans.The subjective experience of divine influence occurs in the mind, in particularthrough the operation of two mental faculties: the “rational” and the“imaginative.” The imaginative faculty§114 [part0037.html#ft114] is not what weusually consider the “imagination,” that which “makes things up,” but rather itis the mental mechanism responsible for mediating perceptions, emotions, andsomatic experiences. In more modern terms, we might call it the circuitry of themind-brain complex mediating those functions. It also reproduces sensoryexperience using images of perceptions and sensations whose immediate causes nolonger exist; that is, the imaginative faculty possesses memory. Finally, theimagination combines these images in novel ways; for example, we might have seena horse and a human in the real world, and then we imagine a centaur.The medieval Jewish philosophers consider the imaginative faculty more physicalor corporeal than the rational one because it deals with body-based data:perceptions, emotions, and the like. Therefore, the imagination, dependent as itis on the body, is something whose degree of development, what the medievalJewish philosophers call its “degree of perfection,” is more fixed at birth andis relatively less modifiable by education or training.The rational faculty*115 [part0037.html#ft115] cognizes. It performsintellectual functions, logically processing formless ideas. It assesses truthand makes rational decisions. Because the rational faculty deals with less“solid” or corporeal objects, the philosophers consider it the higher ranking ofthe two, as it more closely resembles God in this aspect of incorporeality. Therational faculty also can recall concepts and combine them in novel ways. Therational faculty is more amenable to training and education than is theimagination. Through education, one’s intellect may be potential and then becomeactual.METAPHYSICAL EXPLANATIONS OF PROPHECYAll the medieval Jewish philosophers except Saadiah believe that the propheticexperience exists in the subjective realm. Only Saadiah teaches that prophecyresults from God forming a “created sound” or “created light” that one perceiveswhile awake, with the external senses in the objective world. He equates the“created light” with kavod, which in his model comprises every element of whatone apprehends in prophecy. Saadiah’s theory takes us into the realm of the“miraculous” appearance of physical objects, a notion that leads us away fromthe approach I have been taking throughout this book. Rather, I have beenfocusing on characterizing and developing models of prophecy as a subjectiveexperience. In this, I follow all the other medieval authors.My taking the default position that prophecy is a subjective experience also isconsistent with how I previously addressed the beings when I wrote DMT: TheSpirit Molecule. There I proposed a spectrum of “contact” experiences, with onepole consisting of consciousness-toconsciousness interactions and the other poleconsisting of body-tobody interactions. Because no beings materialized in ourresearch room and no volunteers demonstrated physical signs, such as implants orburns, I chose to build my model on the consciousness-to-consciousness platform.Saadiah’s model of the objective reality of the prophetic experience is more inline with the body-to-body perspective, which I chose to de-emphasize.All our writers except Saadiah teach that what one sees, hears, and feels in theprophetic state, its phenomenological content, consists of what one’simaginative capacities allow. Angels, beings, and other forms, while they existin the perceiver’s mind, are not their “real” form. What we see are “insensible”processes, forces, and objects existing in previously invisible realms. Theimagination’s raw materials garb or enclothe the previously invisible things tomake them apprehensible.Maimonides’ theory is that divine influence emanates on the two facultiesconsistent with their degree of perfection or development. Those with a highlydeveloped rational, but not imaginative, faculty become wise, as in the case ofphilosophers or scientists.*116 [part0037.html#ft116] When the imagination ismore perfect than the intellect, one may become a statesman, lawgiver, ordiviner. Only when both faculties are equally and highly developed is onecapable of attaining prophecy. Gradations occur in prophetic rank due togradations in development of those faculties.5 [part0038.html#fn82]All that being said, the presence or absence of prophecy ultimately depends onGod’s willing that the person experience it. In this context, our authors teachthat possessing imaginative and rational perfection makes one “qualified” forprophecy but does not ensure it. Nevertheless, the more qualified one is, themore likely it is that God will choose that person.When divine influence affects someone with highly and equally developed rationaland imaginative faculties, the stimulated rational faculty, the higher of thetwo, overflows “downward” onto the imaginative. This allows the imagination tomake “sensible” the “insensible” or formless contents of the rational faculty.The intellect then interprets and communicates the contents of the imaginationthat the imagination generates in response to this overflow of originallyinsensible information. Differences in the imaginative faculty, which iscorporeal and thus varies across individual bodies, explain why propheticvisions vary whereas their messages do not.The prophet receives an abstract notion that can’t be conveyed in concreteterms, and therefore he or she uses the imagination to present the message in apictorial or metaphorical form. Because the visions and voices of the propheticstate belong to the imagination, prophets treat them allegorically, at leastwhen the subject is a theological or metaphysical truth. The message is divine,but one cannot apprehend nor transmit it without the seen images and heard wordsfilling the imagination. Due to the allegorical nature of much of prophecy,communicating it may be as difficult as, or even more difficult than, attainingit, as the majority of Daniel’s and Zechariah’s visions attest. Nevertheless,the highly developed imagination of a prophet produces parables conveyingimportant information of their own, what Maimonides, quoting Proverbs 25:1,refers to as “silver settings” for “golden apples.”6 [part0038.html#fn83]Using this model, one may suggest that Isaiah’s vision in chapter 6 of his bookand Ezekiel’s vision in chapter 1 of his both had the same “vision” of thechariot. However, Isaiah’s superior intellect allowed him to communicate itsmeaning better than did Ezekiel. In the case of Moses, the Hebrew Bible’soutstanding prophet, his perfected intellect and imagination allowed him themost unimpeded prophetic experience: nearly entirely verbal information that hereadily communicated to his audience.THE PROPHETIC MESSAGEThe medieval Jewish philosophers laud biblical prophecy and its message; thatis, all but Spinoza, who had his reasons not to.*117 [part0037.html#ft117] Theybelieve that the prophetic message emanates from God or His intermediaries andtherefore possesses ultimate truth value. Prophecy provides unique insights andteachings about moral, theological, and natural law because its divine sourcepossesses all of this knowledge. The information one attains in the propheticstate is either inaccessible through the rational methods of philosophy orscience, or if it were, would require more time, aptitude, and training toacquire than most of us possess. This latter point is one made especiallyforcefully by Saadiah.In addition, the prophetic message presents itself in a form that the masses arecapable of accepting, if not thoroughly understanding. For example, the notionof an “angry” God, while not strictly true, because God does not have feelings,teaches obedience to laws with a divine origin that promote individual andsocial welfare.The Location of the Prophetic MessageDoes divine overflow contain the information one apprehends in prophecy? Or doesit instead simply illuminate our own latent knowledge? The medieval Jewishphilosophers discuss this issue, and while the nuances they raise are subtle, itis worth considering the general question. This is because we need to considerhow message-poor the DMT experience is relative to that of prophecy. If one ofthe outcomes of this book is the development of projects attempting to elicitprophecy or prophecy-like states by means of judiciously using psychedelicdrugs, there needs to be some way to increase the informational content of thedrug state. Therefore, understanding how the medieval Jewish philosophersconceive of the location, nature, and accessibility of the prophetic message isrelevant for our purposes.Some of our medieval authors suggest that there is no information as such indivine efflux; rather, it simply strengthens one’s faculties in order to accessinformation that the mind already possesses in some form or another. This is amodel positing the “embedded” nature of the prophetic message. Others proposethat divine overflow strengthens one’s faculties in order to apprehend themessage that the emanation contains; that is, emanation both containsinformation and enables us to comprehend it. While the particulars may differ,the consistent theme is that something—divine emanation—from outside theindividual affects him or her, resulting in attainment of the prophetic message.Canonical vs. Non-canonical Prophetic FiguresHere I would like to clarify an issue that I referred to previously. Thisconcerns the distinction between canonical prophets, such as Moses, Isaiah, andJeremiah, and non-canonical ones. The criterion for this distinction is notnecessarily the level of prophetic attainment. Both types communicate withangels or God (or both), and the message is true and highly relevant. Thesenon-canonical figures such as Abraham, Jacob, Samson’s mother, and many othersattain high prophetic stature but do not leave a book or teachings behind. If weare to assume that both types attain prophecy by means of identical metaphysicalmechanisms, divine emanation overflowing onto equally highly developed rationaland imaginative faculties, we must look elsewhere for the source of thisdifference. Several solutions are possible.The social and political circumstances of the canonical prophets differ fromthose of many of the non-canonical figures. The canonical prophets preachedduring a highly tumultuous historical era, to an often corrupt and recalcitrantmonarchy, through two catastrophic exiles. The absence of such situations facingthe non-canonical prophets may account for the lack of canonical figures, exceptfor Moses, during pre-monarchical times. Regarding Moses, his circumstances wereeven more extraordinary, in that he acted as midwife for the birth of the Hebrewnation, and was responsible for transmitting its new laws, rituals, and otherrequirements.Another place to search for an explanation of the difference between canonicaland non-canonical prophecy is in the information content of the experienceitself. If divine efflux contains information, then the information that God orHis intermediaries is communicating is more complex in the case of the canonicalprophet. On the other hand, if the divine overflow illuminates something thatthe prophet’s mind already somehow possesses, then the difference lies in theprophet’s personality, eloquence, morality, sense of social obligation, and soon.The cases of Elijah and Elisha are illustrative in this context. Both attainedto the highest rungs of prophetic experience but did not leave behind teachings,despite living during the tumultuous monarchical era. This suggests that theinformational content of the experience itself differed in their cases ratherthan personal or sociocultural factors playing the determinative role.HOW ONE BECOMES A PROPHETThe medieval Jewish philosophers debate whether prophecy is a “mission” or a“perfection.” The prophecy-as-a-perfection viewpoint posits that one trains forprophecy and then attains it. This requires possessing optimal physicalcapacities from birth, especially the brain—where the medieval Jewishphilosophers believe the imagination resides—and undergoing suitable educationand training of the rational faculty. Some commentators add the variables oflove, virtue, piety, and courage. When one has met these conditions, she or heattains prophecy.The notion of prophecy-as-a-mission proposes that God chooses someone forprophecy simply because of necessity. The time and place require God’scommunication with an individual or group. As a concession to the medievalauthors who consider prophecy a perfection, proponents of the “mission”viewpoint add that God perfects the intellect and imagination of such people tosuit the requirements of the moment.This issue has significant implications with respect to whether prophecy todayremains within our reach. If prophecy is a perfection, then we may strive forit, and some of us may attain it. There have been, and will continue to be,athletic, artistic, scientific, and political geniuses whose constitutions andtraining have allowed them to attain such heights. However, if prophecy isstrictly a mission, in the sense that God chooses whom He will regardless ofone’s qualifications, there is little we can do to experience it.In support of the view that prophecy is a mission, we read about a namelessforeign foot soldier telling his friend one morning about a prophetic dream thataccurately predicts a Hebrew military victory (Judg. 7:13–14). Amos explicitlyproclaims his lack of qualifications and the missionary nature of his career: Iam neither a prophet nor the son of a prophet, but a cattle herder and anexaminer of sycamores. YHVH took me from behind the flock, and YHVH said to me,“Go prophesy to my people Israel” (Amos 7:14–15).Most medieval authors take a compromise position and suggest that God choosesfor His mission someone who is qualified. Jeremiah’s call to prophecyexemplifies the interplay of mission and perfection. God tells him: Before Iformed you in the womb, I knew you, and before you left the womb, I sanctifiedyou. I established you as a prophet unto the nations (Jer. 1:5). This suggeststhat Jeremiah’s biological constitution at birth, the bases for his imaginativefaculty, qualified him for his mission.Jeremiah’s reply supports the idea that a suitable constitution alone isnecessary but not sufficient, for he lacks intellectual maturity: Alas my LordYHVH, see, I do not know how to speak, for I am just a youth (Jer. 1:6). Godresponds by strengthening his intellectual and verbal capacities, which werepreviously lacking, and thus Jeremiah becomes qualified: YHVH stretched out Hishand and touched my mouth, and YHVH said to me, “Behold, I have placed My wordsin your mouth” (Jer. 1:9). God then tests Jeremiah’s ability to interpret thevisions He causes him to see, and confirms Jeremiah’s new status (Jer. 1:11–14).Objections to Prophecy as a PerfectionMaimonides’ view of prophecy as a perfection, that God is more likely to choosea perfected individual, is not especially defensible. Those who attain asuperior level of prophecy may actually lack a very well developed rationalfaculty. For example, Adam and Eve, who are privy to an easy conversationalrelationship with God, thought that they could hide from Him in the Garden ofEden and thus avoid the consequences of eating the proscribed fruit (Gen. 3:8).In other words, they lacked the basic knowledge of God’s omnipresence, somethingthe medieval Jewish philosophers believe one may attain through rationaldeduction. And Abraham’s arguing with God to save Sodom and Gomorrah, if thereexisted ten righteous men within the two cities (Gen. 18:23–33), suggests thathe did not possess knowledge of God’s omniscience, also attainable through theapplication of a highly developed intellect.Spinoza refers to these and other examples in contending that what passes forprophecy in the Hebrew Bible are the utterances of individuals whose vividimaginations are more active than their intellects. Consistent with his attemptto debunk the authority of biblical prophecy—or more precisely, the revealednature of the Hebrew Bible—he offers his low opinion of the imagination relativeto the intellect in its ability to obtain truth.Spinoza points to how the imagination is more active when people are asleep,ill, dying, afraid, or otherwise reduced in their rational faculties. OpposingMaimonides, he opines that the intellect and imagination function in oppositionto, rather than in synergy with, each other. One waxes only when the otherwanes. And because the intellect can’t control the imagination, the imaginationusually is wrong. At the same time, Spinoza believes that the Hebrew prophetswere genuinely devout and moral. The combination of these two factors, apowerful imagination and virtue, led to teachings that are morally useful, buthave nothing to do with either natural or theological truths.Several medieval Jewish philosophers suggest that a high degree of moraldevelopment is also necessary for attaining prophecy. Living a pious life helpsprevent indulging in beliefs or behavior detrimental to perfecting one’sintellect and for maintaining one’s physical health that is necessary foroptimal imaginative function. However, Balaam the Canaanite prophet, despite hisrequesting and receiving regular congress with God seemingly as easily as Moses,hires himself out to a local king to curse the camp of God’s chosen people onits way to Canaan (Num. 22:2–24:25). And Moses’s volatile temper results in hissmashing the original pair of God-inscribed tablets containing the TenCommandments (Exod. 32:19). His impetuousness also precludes his entering intoCanaan, as I mentioned in the previous chapter.How then to determine whether prophecy is a mission or perfection? The stance Iam most comfortable taking in this debate is as follows: First, Hebrew biblicalprophecy exists as the text explicates it. It is communication with God or Hisintermediaries. This, of course, is the basis for the theoneurological model Iam proposing. Second, we cannot really know why God chooses whom He does. Thus,a reasonable approach is that prophecy is both a perfection and a mission. Beingqualified makes it more likely that one will receive prophecy, if God decides tobestow it.FORETELLINGThe medieval Jewish philosophers note that prediction may occur throughnon-prophetic as well as prophetic means. In the case of a “selffulfilling”prophecy, the prediction influences the future. Or there may exist only acoincidental relationship between the event and its foretelling. Sometimes ahighly developed imagination operating in the absence of a commensuratelypowerful intellect combines past events in a novel manner, resulting in anaccurate prediction. Finally, successful prediction may result from deductivereasoning by an expert; for example, a meteorologist predicts the weather moreaccurately than not.When the medieval Jewish philosophers do invoke metaphysical mechanisms forpredicting, they draw upon their understanding of God’s omniscience and will.Within God, or the Active Intellect, exists the knowledge of all possibleoutcomes.*118 [part0037.html#ft118] As one who is capable of deciphering divineefflux, the prophet captures one particular set of outcomes resulting from thepresent set of circumstances that God may will into actuality.KAVODKavod’s nature is liminal and highly dynamic. It possesses attributes andactions somewhere between, or as a hybrid of, God and Its intermediaries.Kavod’s elusive, and allusive, properties contribute to the variety ofexplanations that the medieval Jewish philosophers have developed regarding howit operates.One of the properties of kavod upon which turn mechanistic hypotheses is itsapprehensibility by the masses. It is difficult to explain how all of the Hebrewcamp qualified for prophecy, constitutionally or by training. However, Saadiah’sexplanation of prophetic phenomenology responds to this qualm: kavod is a lightor sound that God creates for a special purpose. It is an external object thatthe physical senses perceive. In a related fashion, the luminous visualproperties of kavod prompted Judah Halevi to speculate that it somehow combinesmaterial and spiritual properties. He proposes that it is a very subtlephysical, visual aura surrounding a spiritual entity, or that it is a physicalreflection of divine light, like the light of dusk from the sun. His definitionequivocates regarding whether one must be a prophet to perceive it.If we assume, however, that prophecy is solely a subjective experience, we needto fall back upon the notion of prophecy as a mission. God temporarily perfectedthe masses’ rational and intellectual faculties for a specific purpose. Kavod’sill-defined visual and auditory properties point to a lower-level, stopgapquality consistent with this expedient granting of prophecy to essentiallyunqualified individuals. Evidence in support of this latter notion is that whenkavod does manifest its “voice” to people, those who hear formed words (such asMoses and Aaron) rather than unformed sounds (as do the masses) have alreadyattained to prophetic stature.FALSE PROPHECYThe Hebrew Bible provides several self-evident processes by which false prophecymay occur, such as plagiary and deliberate fabrication. However, the medievalJewish philosophers suggest other mechanisms by which false prophecy mayoperate; for instance, cases in which the false prophet is sincere and thedetermination of the falsity of the message is more difficult.The metaphysical mechanism common to our authors’ explanations of false prophecyis that false prophets do experience visions, but the visions are not the resultof divine influence. Rather, they occur in the setting of an overactiveimagination absent of a highly developed intellect.*119 [part0037.html#ft119]Jeremiah captures this notion when, speaking for God, he says: The prophet witha dream tells a dream, but the one with My word speaks My word of truth (Jer.23:28).The other mechanism the Hebrew Bible, but not necessarily the medieval Jewishphilosophers, posits for how false prophecy works is that God Himself deliversto the false prophet a deliberately spurious message. I raise this issue onlyreluctantly, because it leads into a very murky theological quagmire. Theclassic example of this phenomenon is when God wishes King Ahab to die in a warbecause of his many sins. A “lying spirit” volunteers to deceive the king’scourt prophets. Their true prophetic reception of a false prediction of victoryencourages the king to enter the battle. Another true prophet, who has no courtaffiliation, that the king summons to validate the court prophets’ advice,notes: YHVH has put a spirit of falsehood in the mouths of all these prophets ofyours, for YHVH has decreed evil upon you (1 Kings 22:23). This is anotherexample of how subtle and complex is the notion of false prophecy."},{"pageContent":"20The Metaphysics of DMTA Theoneurological Model of ProphecyIn DMT: The Spirit Molecule, I hypothesized that DMT elicits its effects bychemically modifying the receiving characteristics of the mind-brain complex.After receiving an injection of DMT, one’s mind becomes capable of apprehendingpreviously invisible things. These things may be solely the product of themind-brain complex, or they may be external to us, existing in parallel levelsof reality. In my search for where those additional layers of reality mightreside, I first turned to the notions of dark matter and parallel universes,where modern physics is directing its attention in its search for invisibleworlds. Contemporary researchers posit the existence of dark matter, forexample, to explain how much of the universe’s mass appears to be “missing”relative to the gravitational forces that are necessary for it to maintain itsvisible form. In this manner, physics is continuing in the tradition of medievalmetaphysics, attempting to explicate mysterious, observable phenomena byinvoking invisible theoretical processes and objects.In the previous chapter, I outlined how the medieval Jewish philosopherssimilarly developed metaphysical hypotheses for prophecy, an observablephenomenon of great interest to them but for which no objective mechanisms wereforthcoming. In this chapter, I will use their theories to build a metaphysicalmodel for the DMT experience, another matter of great interest for which we haveonly a limited understanding regarding how it works. I believe I am justified inthis attempt because the similarities between the prophetic and DMT statessuggest common metaphysical mechanisms underlying them. Once we appreciate howtheir shared metaphysical and biological processes may occasion their sharedphenomenology, we may then consider how their differences, especially regardingtheir informational content, reflect different metaphysical processes.As I did in DMT: The Spirit Molecule, I will build hypotheses using generalnotions rather than review particular biomedical research findings. I will notfocus extensively on specific psychopharmacologic data regarding DMT, thebiological concomitants of spiritual experience, nor the neuroscience of theimagination and intellect. Instead, due to the extremely preliminary nature ofthis project, I wish to work with as much conceptual freedom as possible inorder to begin bridging the psychedelic drug state and prophetic experienceusing medieval metaphysics. My aim in this exercise is to broadly introduce atop-down theoneurological model for spiritual experience that provides acounterpoint to the contemporary bottom-up neurotheological paradigm. Atheoneurological model uses the vocabulary, concepts, and processes ofmetaphysics and theology while taking into account the presence and propertiesof endogenous mind-altering compounds such as DMT.One immediate effect of this new model is that it provides a novel religiousanswer to the “If so, so what?” conundrum that the biological spiritualityresearch field confronts. A less cryptic version of Dr. Freedman’s question is,“Why did nature configure the brain to provide these types of experiences?”Neurotheology provides answers within a biomedical model: Religious experienceis good for your health, good for society, and good for the species.Theoneurology provides answers within a religious context: God created andsustains our biological mind-body complex to provide a means of communicatingwith Him. By communicating with God and following His guidelines, we draw nearerto Him and thus fulfill His wish for closeness with us. The theoneurologicalmodel complements the neurotheological one by providing a higher level ofabstraction. It places the origin, message, and purpose of the state external tothe individual and species while basing itself on a religiously oriented andtheocentric worldview.DMT AND THE PROPHETIC STATENow that I have demonstrated convincing evidence regarding similarities betweenthe phenomenology of the prophetic and DMT experiences—their perceptual,emotional, somatic, and other properties—it is possible to state clearly whatthis suggests at the biological level. The similar subjective effects ofbiblical prophecy and the DMT experience suggest similar brain activity in bothsyndromes.This comparable biology may reflect the presence and activity of elevated brainlevels of DMT. On the other hand, elevated brain levels of DMT may not be themost immediate proximate cause. That is, DMT administration in the volunteersmay elicit a “downstream” biological effect, say “process X,” that is ultimatelyresponsible for the subjective experiences they described. Those downstreameffects may take place in prophetic figures as a result of a proximate causeother than endogenous DMT; in other words, something other than DMT may initiate“process X” in prophetic states. Nevertheless, for the purposes of thisdiscussion, it is much easier to focus on DMT because its effects in theresearch subjects and descriptions of biblical prophecy are so similar. Ourworking hypothesis is that elevated endogenous DMT may mediate the features ofthe prophetic experience that it shares with the experimental DMT effect.IMAGINATION AND INTELLECT, PHENOMENOLOGY AND MESSAGEThe similarities between the prophetic and DMT states are less compelling whenwe examine their respective messages, especially those of the canonicalprophets. Using the medieval Jewish philosophers’ system of metaphysics, thesefindings suggest that DMT administration stimulates or strengthens theimaginative faculty, the locus of the phenomenological contents of both sets ofexperiences. However, DMT appears to exert little effect on the rationalfaculty, where the information content manifests. Let’s look more closely at theimplications of such a hypothesis.The metaphysical model posits that in prophecy, God’s or Its intermediaries’influence emanates onto equally highly developed rational and imaginativefaculties. Either this influence first affects the intellect and then theimagination in a qualified individual, or it first emanates directly onto theimaginative faculty. In either case, the intellect extracts comprehensible andcommunicable information from the contents of the imagination. The criticalelements here are that in prophecy (1) the source of this activation is externalto the individual and is divine and (2) both faculties are similarly and highlydeveloped.If endogenous DMT were involved in the workings of the imaginative faculty inprophecy, it is in the service of transmitting God’s influence to the experient.The divine overflow bestows perceptible form to fundamentally imperceptibleinformation by using the imagination to generate more or less recognizableobjects that are intended to convey that information. Then the intellect more orless accurately interprets and communicates the message that the imaginativecontents represent.After administering DMT in a research setting, the same putative elevation ofbrain levels of the compound may exist as in the prophetic state. However, inthis case, DMT is stimulating the imagination “from below,” as it were, not“from above.” In addition, it is not affecting the rational faculty in anysignificant manner. The relative paucity of the DMT state’s message may thenreflect a difference in what catalyzes elevated brain DMT levels. Divine effluxstimulates the imagination—perhaps through DMT—as well as the intellect, whereasDMT only activates the imagination.If divine efflux contains information, rather than only illuminating what themind already possesses in some form or another, this would be another reason whythe DMT state’s message is so sparse. The substance itself does not containinformation; rather, the contents of the imagination that DMT generates reflectintrinsic personal and not extrinsic Godly influences.Let’s now look at the idea that stimulating the imagination by drugadministration “from below” is functionally analogous to what may occur in trueprophecy. There are many examples in the Hebrew Bible of certain circumstancesleading to the prophetic state, which I discussed in chapter 8, Prophet andProphecy. They include fasting, prayer, delicious food, loneliness, despair,music, proximity to death, sexual abstinence, certain body postures, meditation,and particular geographic locations. These all affect the body, which themedieval Jewish philosophers teach is the basis of the imaginative faculty.Thus, these exigencies may make prophecy more likely by temporarily enhancingthe imagination’s activity. They also may lead to increasing endogenous levelsof DMT through enhanced stress-related synthesis.*120 [part0037.html#ft120] Thequality of the resultant prophetic state, now manifest because of theDMT-mediated enhanced imagination (in a true prophet), would then depend on thecorresponding ability of the rational faculty to extract information from theimaginative contents.Here I wish to reiterate the notion of being “qualified” to receive divineefflux. God chooses whom He will to experience prophecy. At the same time, it ismore likely that God will choose someone who is qualified, the most basicrequirements being highly developed rational and imaginative faculties.Endogenous or exogenous DMT may temporarily elevate the function of theimagination and thus make one more qualified in that regard. However, it wouldhave no effect on increasing the intellectual faculty’s state of readiness. Andit does not automatically ensure Godly efflux.THE EMBEDDED NATURE OF THE PHENOMENOLOGY AND OF THE MESSAGEOne “neurotheological” way to conceptualize the process I have been outlining isthat prophecy and the DMT states represent the stimulation of a reflex thatresides in the mind-brain complex. In other words, both phenomenologicalsyndromes are embedded within us, waiting for the appropriate catalyst: DMTinjection or hypothetical self-induced stimulation from below, or externallyinduced stimulation by divine efflux from above. At the same time, we mustrecognize how interdependent is the relationship between the information theexperience contains and the phenomenological contents of the experience. Thesecontents convey the message.This led me to wonder if the prophetic message also is embedded in the brain,waiting for its appropriate trigger. This notion is consistent with the teachingof those medieval Jewish philosophers who believe that Godly emanation does notcontain information but simply sheds light on what the mind already contains. Inprophecy, the prophetic state is the trigger for attaining to the propheticmessage. Why shouldn’t the DMT state, to the extent that it shares biologicalfeatures with prophecy, similarly occasion apprehension of the propheticmessage?After some consideration of this idea, I again found the answer in the notionthat prophecy affects both faculties, whereas DMT affects only the imaginativeone. Activation of the imaginative faculty alone, either from above or frombelow, doesn’t strengthen one’s ability to understand or communicate thecontents of that faculty, regardless of the source of its stimulation.THE TRUTH OF THE MESSAGERecall that DMT volunteers’ insights sometimes were consistent with those of theprophetic message. If DMT works primarily on the imaginative faculty, minimallyaffecting the rational one, how might this occur? We can approach this problemby pointing to the idea that the rational faculty works with the contents of theimagination regardless of their origin. The intellect asks, “What do thesecontents mean?” and operates on them according to its abilities. Thetruthfulness of the message the intellect extracts from the imagination’scontents, strictly speaking, is not dependent on their source. This is analogousto how a non-prophet may arrive at the same truths as a prophet, although bynon-prophetic means; for example, through deduction or intuition.There is a danger, however, in equating the message one receives in anon-prophetic state of heightened imagination with true prophecy and thusclaiming spiritual authority. This is false prophecy inasmuch as the personclaims prophetic inspiration but is arriving at his or her conclusionsnon-prophetically. Endogenous or exogenous DMT may contribute to theimaginations’ heightened function, but the information does not derive from adivine source.In cases of divine efflux solely affecting the imaginative but not the rationalfaculty, the contents of the imagination reflect true things because theirsource is divine. However, if the intellect is poorly developed, it maymisinterpret what it apprehends in the imagination. This misinterpretation oftrue images also may qualify as false prophecy. If one recognizes the phenomenonfor what it is, however, benefits may still accrue, as Maimonides points out inthe case of statesmen or diviners. But it is not prophecy.THE URIM AND THUMMIMIn chapter 8, Prophet and Prophecy, I described how the Urim and Thummim restedin a compartment behind the Hebrew High Priest’s breastplate. The breastplatecontained twelve stones of different colors, each of which sat in a metalsetting and each of which represented one of the twelve Hebrew tribes, whosenames a craftsman had engraved on the stone. The High Priest in an inspired orprophetic state would inquire of the Urim and Thummim, and they provided ananswer. These questions were usually simple, in which a “yes” or “no” response,or the selection of a particular Hebrew tribe for a specific task, sufficed.The etymological relationship between urim and light*121 [part0037.html#ft121]suggested to some medieval Jewish philosophers that the breastplate stones litup in specific patterns that represented the answer to the question. Might ithave been the case that in a prophecy-like state resulting from mildly elevatedlevels of endogenous DMT, modified visual function made the stones seem to“glow”? And if the prophecy-like state truly represented Godly efflux, therational faculty of the priest would provide the correct interpretation of theglowing stones’ pattern.THE WORLD TO COMEThe concept of a “new world” following the “end of days” or other similartransitions has been and continues to be the subject of tremendous speculationand hope. The medieval Jewish philosophers have written extensively on thetopic, perhaps in part because the Hebrew Bible’s references are vague orcontradictory.Maimonides, for example, differentiates between a messianic era and a world tocome.1 [part0038.html#fn85] In the former, all the laws of nature exist exactlyas they do now. The only difference is that all Jews live in Israel and are freeto study and practice their laws without other nations’ enmity. He adds thatduring the messianic era, bodily resurrection takes place.†122[part0037.html#ft122] After resurrection, lifespans are extremely long, similarto those we encounter in the early generations of humanity that Genesisdescribes, in the range of one thousand years. The messianic era exists in thisworld as the first stage of a more ideal life after the material world. Thismore ideal life Maimonides calls the “world to come,” an incorporeal state inwhich disembodied souls exist eternally after the body’s death.When descriptions in the Hebrew Bible refer to fundamental changes in nature, inparticular non-corporeal forms and other psychedelic-like characteristics, Iwould like to propose a role for endogenous psychedelics. This should not comeas an entirely surprising suggestion because I have already demonstrated how theworld to come resembles in some ways the DMT experience.I began considering a role for endogenous DMT in the world to come after thediscovery of the DMT-synthesizing gene in humans and other mammals. This gene isresponsible for the enzyme that attaches two methyl groups onto tryptamine, thusforming di-methyltryptamine, or DMT. We are only beginning to understand theregulation of this gene, what turns it on and off. Researchers have inserted thehuman version of this gene into a virus, and when that virus infects mammaliancells in a test tube, those cells produce DMT.2 [part0038.html#fn86]Consider the following scenario: At the onset of the world to come, there is thesudden and profound burst of activity of the DMT-synthesizing gene in allorganisms that contain it.*123 [part0037.html#ft123] This is the tumultuoustransition to the world to come, which then opens up before all of us. Thestimulus for such an activation of the gene, of course, remains even morespeculative than the activation itself. However, we may consider somepossibilities.External forces such as magnetic field shifts, massive gamma ray bursts, andother large-scale geo-celestial perturbations may act as the trigger for thewidespread activation of the DMT-synthesizing gene. Alternatively, the workingsof an internal genetic clock might provide the stimulus. This latter mechanismwould preclude one’s being able to shield oneself, so to speak, against thistransitional event, whose universal nature is one of its definingcharacteristics.Remember that these are mechanistic speculations regarding the nature of andtransition into the world to come. They do not address the ultimate cause of itsexistence nor of the transition into it. As with prophecy in general, God isthat ultimate cause.It is of interest to consider how the imaginative faculty contributes to thisscenario. Because the imagination is a corporeal function, there may be noimages or feelings associated with “life without a body.” All the sights,sounds, and emotions we have learned to associate with the transition tophysical death—the near-death experience—may occur at the transition point, butafter physical death and the removal of any corporeality from the equation, wehave no idea what is in store.4 [part0038.html#fn88]PROPHECY, DMT, AND THE BEINGSThe beings may be viewed in several ways. They may be thoroughly objectivethings, or they may be sensible representations of either subjective orobjective forces or processes.As subjective things, the beings might represent our own psychology, in whichcase their nature would be like that of a dream’s contents. At the mostsuperficial level, they may represent residual feelings or thoughts that linger,barely consciously, in the backs of our minds. At a deeper level, they may besymbolic renditions of more significant emotional dynamics that had beenpreviously completely unconscious. For example, a healing being may represent ahealth-care provider for whom we have strong feelings that we cannot express ineveryday life. These psychological notions draw on the implicit assumption ofthe term psychedelic defined as “mind-manifesting.” Our apprehension of thebeings reflects the workings of our minds.As objective things, we might understand the beings as residing in alternativelevels of reality such as dark matter or parallel universes. Modifiedconsciousness resulting from elevated brain levels of DMT, endogenous inprophecy or exogenous in my research subjects, allows someone to peer directlyinto those realms and thus view their inhabitants. One approach to assess theobjective nature of the beings we perceive in the DMT and prophetic states wouldbe to develop instruments that allow us to capture images of what exists in darkmatter or parallel universes. By comparing these images to descriptions of theprophetic and DMT states, we would be able to determine how closely theyresemble each other. If they do, we could more confidently posit an “external”location of the phenomena.Finally, the beings may be sensible representations of essentially insensibleprocesses or forces. For example, the beings appear to consist of light.However, this may not be their true nature but only the visible manifestation ofa particular process, akin to how a flame visibly expresses the operation ofcombustion or light represents our perception of electromagnetic radiation. Ourperceptual apparatus, as it were, can see only what it is capable of seeing.Now, I’d like to expand the field of the term psychedelic to include how ourminds apprehend forces that are externally, not internally, existent. I believedoing so allows us to interpret the beings as representing previously invisibleexternal objects or forces. However, rather than suggesting that the mindgenerates those images, this notion proposes that the mind affects how weperceive external objects or forces, how they manifest in our minds.We apprehend the beings in a more or less clear manner depending on the degreeof overlay from our own psychology, constitution, training, and education. If wepossess highly developed rational and imaginative faculties, we apprehend in asunadulterated a manner as possible those external things. The lesswell-developed these faculties, the more we muddy our observations of thoseexternal things with our own internal workings, our wishes, hopes, conflicts,ignorance, and so on. That muddying results in our subjective experience beingmore of a mirror and less of a window.What are the external forces that the beings may represent? They may includehealing and illness, strength and weakness, love and hate, evil and good, wisdomand folly. Using the medieval Jewish philosophers’ metaphysics, these are whatone might consider God’s intermediaries, the vehicles through which Godly effluxworks providentially. For example, the angel Raphael may represent healingforces, and Gabriel the force of strength. These world-affecting forces manifestin apprehensible visual, somatic, and other modalities using the repertoire ourminds possess.This model of the beings adds an additional level of sophistication to ourdiscussion of their objective, externally existent nature. That is, they may notbe “inhabitants” of other levels of reality, but rather omnipresent forces thatexist outside of ourselves that we observe by means of our subjectiveconsciousness. If this is the case, then our “invisible worlds camera,” ratherthan capturing images of localized objects, may capture images of more pervasiveforces exerting local effects.On the other hand, our hypothetical instruments might be unable to capture anyimages of these external forces or objects—discrete, localized, or localrepresentations of omnipresent forces—because perceiving them requires aninteraction between them and our minds. In the case of a local manifestation ofomnipresent forces, we might say that lifeless machines cannot apprehend divineefflux; it is simply too subtle to be objectively recorded.DMT, CONSCIOUSNESS, AND THE NATURE OF REALITYThe more we learn about DMT’s role in consciousness, the instrument by whoseagency we perceive and think, the more blurred such distinctions between innerand outer become. In chapter 3, I referred to studies demonstrating activetransport of DMT across the blood-brain barrier. This suggests that DMT may benecessary for normal brain function. And normal brain function means normalconsciousness. In other words, the brain appears to require an endogenouspsychedelic substance to maintain normal consciousness.Recent studies are homing in on additional roles for endogenous DMT in mediatingour experience of the world. Experiments in primates have demonstrated that thegene that makes the DMT-synthesizing enzyme is highly active in the retina, andlevels of the enzyme itself are correspondingly high in this visual organ.5[part0038.html#fn89] This suggests that our visual perception of the world alsomay be under the influence of an endogenous psychedelic substance. It should beevident by now that research examining the relationship between endogenous DMTand altered and normal consciousness is a matter of utmost importance to thefields of neuroscience, consciousness, epistemology, philosophy, andspirituality.While these possible roles for DMT in mediating our worlds of vision andconsciousness complicate any definitive answers regarding the “reality” of thebeings, this uncertainly has little effect on how they impact one in theprophetic and DMT states. For those who engage with them, they exert tremendouseffects, as real, profound, and meaningful as anything we may ever encounter inour lives. We see and hear them, and they see and hear us. In the case of theHebrew Bible, the messages that the beings related have resonated for millenniaand underlie half of the world population’s religious beliefs and practices,leaving their indelible imprint on nearly every Western social, scientific,political, and artistic institution."},{"pageContent":"> Part V> > The Past, Present, and Future of Prophecy"},{"pageContent":"21The End of ProphecyWe now are in a position to take a long view of prophecy. I have discussed howmy psychedelic drug research with DMT led me to the Hebrew Bible’s notion ofthis paradigmatic Western spiritual experience, reviewed salient features of theHebrew Bible’s structure and contents relevant to prophecy, and characterizedprophecy’s features and compared them side by side with those of the DMT effect.This comparison demonstrated that the two states display striking perceptual,emotional, cognitive, and other phenomenological similarities. It also revealedthat the prophetic message, especially in the case of the canonical prophets, ismuch more abundant, sophisticated, and highly articulated than that of the DMTexperience. While the messages of the non-canonical prophetic figures arequantitatively more modest than those of the canonical prophets, theynevertheless contain more truth value and impact than the information acquiredby the DMT subjects.I have reviewed the medieval Jewish philosophers’ metaphysical models for howprophecy works and attempted to relate them to the DMT state. Joining the twoseemingly disparate phenomena of prophecy and the DMT experience using thebridge of medieval Jewish metaphysics has been one of the primary goals of mytheoneurology model. The essential feature of this model is that it proposesthat God communicates with humans through the agency of the mind-brain complex.DMT may be a critical component in this exchange.Now that we have learned what prophecy is and how it may come about, what do theHebrew Bible and the Jewish tradition say about its presence in our times? Asusual, we find opposing views. One opinion is that prophecy has simply continuedin much the same form as it did during the biblical era. Moses predicts: Aprophet from your midst, from your brethren, like me, shall YHVH, your God,establish for you—to him shall you listen (Deut. 18:15).On the other hand, prophecy may “end.” This end may occur in one of two ways.The more sanguine alternative is that in the distant future everyone willprophesy. Thus, prophecy as a unique phenomenon, different from normalconsciousness, will cease to exist. This is one of the features of the “nextworld” that I previously discussed. As God tells the prophet: My spirit which isupon you and My words that I have placed in your mouth will not be withdrawnfrom your mouth, nor from the mouth of your offspring, nor from the mouth ofyour offspring’s offspring . . . from now until forever (Isa. 59:21).The other “end” of prophecy is a true cessation. No one receives andcommunicates God’s message anymore. The psalmist states: Our signs we have notseen, there is no longer a prophet, and none among us knows how long (Ps. 74:9).Similarly, Ezekiel foretells: They shall seek vision from a prophet, butteaching shall be lost from the priest, and counsel from the elders (Ezek.7:26).One qualifier of this rabbinic proposition modifies the end of prophecy bylimiting it to a particular type. The Second Temple prophets refer to the“earlier prophets” as distinct from themselves. Zechariah states: They did nothearken to the teachings and the words that YHVH of Hosts had sent through Hisspirit by the earlier prophets (Zech. 7:12). However, all the canonical prophetsspeak in God’s name and teach essentially the same message. While the form ofthe message varies across time, place, and personalities, this is the casethroughout the entire biblical record. Perhaps these later prophets are alludingto the end of a specific type of a general phenomenon; for example, preaching toIsrael’s kings.However, rabbinic authorities who inherited the mantle of Jewish leadershiparound the beginning of the common era were more consistent in pronouncingprophecy’s actual end. They taught that this happened during the early SecondTemple period, in the fifth century BCE. The earliest stratum of rabbinicteachings exists in the Talmud, so let’s look at a few representative Talmudicstatements that make this assertion. Because traditional Judaism is essentiallyrabbinic, and rabbinic Judaism is essentially Talmudic, we will see how therabbis laid the groundwork for the two-thousand-year-old Jewish tradition thatprophecy has disappeared.The Talmud states that after the destruction of the First Temple, “only childrenand fools prophesy” (Bava batra 12b), and “the wise are superior to theprophets” (Bava batra 12a). The Second Temple lacked, among other things, “thespirit of prophecy” and the Urim and Thummim prophetic tools (Yoma 21b). Legalacumen now trumped prophecy; for example, determining correct propertyboundaries without reference to previous rabbinic rulings is “nothing butprophecy” (Bava batra 12a). And in the spirit of historic revisionism, theTalmud interprets certain biblical references to prophets as “really” referringto legal scholars (Shabbat 119b).How could prophecy have ended? Did it cease to exist because of some biologicalchange in humans? Or were there perturbations in the theological-metaphysicalrealms? Did the authorities simply legislate away prophecy? Or did it never end?METAPHYSICS AND THEOLOGYAn End to ProphecyThe medieval Jewish philosophers propose several reasons why prophecy ended,none of which stand up to biblical scrutiny. For example, Judah Halevi, whowrote when no significant Jewish population inhabited Israel, believes thatprophecy can exist only in Israel because its geology and geography possessunique metaphysical properties. Without Jews living in Israel, prophecy couldnot occur, but once they return in the future, prophecy will also. However, theHebrew Bible refutes Halevi’s assertion that prophecy can take place only inIsrael. Ezekiel and Daniel prophesied in Babylonia and Jonah did so in Assyria.Maimonides posits that prophecy requires an optimal constitution and training,and God’s will. He suggests that prophecy ended because of the sorrow of theexile, with depression making prophecy less likely because of its negativeeffects on the imagination. The Hebrew Bible contradicts this assertion:Jeremiah prophesied for decades in a state of near-continuous despondency. Thus,one needs to discard both these explanations—the presence of despondency andresiding outside of Israel—for why prophecy “ended.”As a way out of these and other contradictions, the medieval Jewish philosophersoffer a solution to the problem of prophecy’s end, if indeed there was one, byplacing much greater emphasis on God as the ultimate arbiter of the phenomenon.This is a difficult solution for the Aristotelian Maimonides, who while wearinghis scientist-philosopher’s hat, notes that God does not stint, saying, “Godwill never withhold from any creature that which it deserves,”1[part0038.html#fn90] and “The laws of nature demand that everyone should be aprophet” when the proper conditions are met.2 [part0038.html#fn91] At the sametime, as a Jewish rabbi and community leader, Maimonides cannot go againstcenturies of rabbinic tradition regarding the end of prophecy. Thus, he proposesthat the absence of prophecy in his day is supernatural; one cannot explain itscientifically. It is a miracle: the “miracle of withholding.” Despite the lawsof nature, one can be qualified and yet not attain prophecy if God so decides.Spinoza and the End of ProphecySpinoza’s analysis of prophecy turns on his defining it as any apprehension ofthe truth through the intellect. Therefore, anyone who attains a truthfulcertainty about anything experiences a measure of prophecy. Because, accordingto Spinoza, the Hebrew prophets were wrong about so many natural and theologicallaws, he writes that they possessed a lower degree of prophecy than many of us.Thus, we can’t really say that Spinoza confirmed or denied that prophecy endedbecause of his unique definition. Prophecy as he defines it has always existed.However, prophecy as those who believe in the literal truth of the Hebrew Bibledefine it, never existed, at least qua prophecy.Nevertheless, Spinoza did effectuate an end to prophecy in a very real sense. Hestruck a mortal blow against it as a legitimate area of rational investigation.3[part0038.html#fn92] Because biblical prophecy isn’t really “prophetic,”scientific inquiry into its nature is akin to studying a mirage. In the case ofa mirage, we can study heat, radiation, light, and even people’s sense that theyare perceiving water, but there is no water. Similarly, for Spinoza, there is noprophecy in the Hebrew Bible. It is also a phantom. The study of “real” prophecyas he defines it is epistemology, the science of how we know things. And if theHebrew Bible contains any miraculous revelation, such as the Golden Rule, itsmiraculous nature precludes its being an object of rational analysis. ForSpinoza, how revelation works is fundamentally unknowable.Spinoza’s treatment of biblical prophecy resulted in the Hebrew Bible becoming abook like any other book. We may understand it within its historical context asa text solely human in origin and not as a product of revelation. One gainsinsights into psychology, archaeology, literature, and so on by studying thetext, but it is not a record of real prophecy, just as a mirage is not theperception of real water.Spinoza also drove a stake into the heart of any attempt to reconcile sciencewith prophetic experience. Because the Hebrew Bible contains little if anythingprophetic, the text instead became poetic, social, political, anthropological,and psychopathological. No longer was it respectable to consider prophecy—as hadthe medievalists before him—as a system of intellects, agents, spheres, God, andhuman mental faculties. Studying prophecy’s shadows and reflections replacedinquiry into its essence.Metaphysical approaches to the text gave way to modern bible studies, secularWestern philosophy, and ultimately psychology. Psychiatry is still workingwithin this paradigm. We see this in Freud’s writings about religion being apathological product of unconscious mental processes,4 [part0038.html#fn93] aswell as in the more recent phenomenon of neurotheology. In this contemporary, ifmore benign, iteration of Freud’s reductionism, neurotheology teaches thatreligious experience similarly “serves a function,” but now it has become anadaptive brain state rather than a way to sublimate unconscious incestuous andmurderous impulses. Spiritual experience enhances our physiological, emotional,and social lives. It is good for us, rather than being how God communicates withus in order to draw us nearer to Him. Those interested in studying prophecy fromthe top down now were seen as reactionaries, saddled by irrational tradition,faith, or even obscurantism. They were not welcome at the table of high-levelscientific or philosophic debate. Any attempt to bring a theocentric metaphysicsof prophecy back within the purview of contemporary philosophic and scientificdiscourse had become pseudoscience.BIOLOGYJulian Jaynes in his book on the “bicameral mind” suggests how the experience ofhearing a spoken voice arose and fell in the course of human evolution.5[part0038.html#fn94] For millennia, those existing in small tribal groupsperceived an “outside” voice advising, admonishing, and otherwise guidingindividuals who faced various decision points. The spoken voice served as theprototype of self-consciousness and introspection. Jaynes theorizes that thisvoice was the subjective experience of communication between the brain’s rightand left cerebral hemispheres.He proposes that several thousand years ago, certain geo-cultural forces exertedselective pressure on the brain in such a manner as to gradually eliminate thisphenomenon. The combined effects of volcanism-induced mass migrations and theestablishment of large city-states influenced the evolution of brain structuresmediating this exchange between its two hemispheres. A new “unified”consciousness emerged that was more adaptable to the increasingly complexphysical and social environments. Jaynes considers the prophets as the lastexemplars of “bicamerality,” a trait that finally died out with them and whoseremnants we observe in those experiencing hallucinatory psychoses. He presentsliterary and archaeological evidence supporting his views, but the physicalanthropological data, evidence of structural brain changes in physical remainsof ancient humans, are lacking.My own contribution to possible biological bases of the “end” of prophecyinvokes endogenous psychedelics. If these compounds mediate elements of theprophetic state, decreased activity of this system would result in thedisappearance of those experiences. This diminished activity might relate to thesynthesis or breakdown of, sensitivity to, or relative proportions of differentpsychoactive molecules. However, as in Jaynes’s case, I know of no data eithersupporting or refuting this hypothesis.HISTORY AND POLITICSThe most cogent arguments I have found for the rabbinic declaration thatprophecy ended are political ones.6 [part0038.html#fn95] That is, it didn’t end,but it was expedient to say that it had. Prophecy “ended” because theauthorities told us so, and we believed them.Various explanations exist for the rabbis’ pronouncing the death of prophecy. Alikely reason pertains to the birth and early growth of Christianity, whichtemporally and geographically coincides with their edict. The earliestChristians, many of whom were Jews, attempted to convert other Jews to this newreligion by claiming that Jesus was a Jewish prophet, if not the promisedmessiah. By retrospectively proclaiming that prophecy had ended severalcenturies before Jesus, the rabbis implied that he possessed no propheticstature.We can see how the rabbis’ response to Christianity affected their attitudetoward prophecy when examining their postbiblical writings. There are six timesthe number of references to the canonical prophetic books in the New Testamentcompared with the contemporaneous rabbinic Mishnah.*124 [part0037.html#ft124]7[part0038.html#fn96] Both of these works were competing for legitimacy among thesame groups, and the quantity of Christian references to prophecy indicates howimportant it was in supporting Christian contentions of the messianic status ofJesus. To counter these claims on the part of Christianity, the rabbis respondedby extirpating prophecy from their competing version of normative Judaism. Therabbis delegitimized contemporary prophecy and prophetic authority in an attemptto delegitimize Christianity’s authority.Prophecy rails against the corruption of those in power. Perhaps the rabbiswanted prophecy to end in order to maintain the precarious safety of the Jewsliving within Roman-occupied Judea. They marginalized anyone who claimedprophetic rank as the basis for criticizing the occupying government. Thisfunction overlapped with that of refuting anyone’s claim to being the messiah,one of whose roles is to redeem the Jewish people from subjugation by othernations. The rabbis had exercised this function throughout the years of theRoman occupation beginning in the first century BCE, not only during the earlyyears of Christianity. If the Jewish religious establishment labeled asimposters those whom the masses considered messianic prophets, the authoritiesmight be more tolerant of eccentrics making overblown claims than they would beof revolutionaries. In fact, the rabbis could claim a greater love for theirco-religionists than that of the prophets or so-called messiahs, for the lattertwo sets of individuals consistently questioned whether the Jews deserved tosurvive because of their continual transgressions against God’s word.In a related manner, the rabbis may have taught that prophecy ended because ithad never been effective and the people no longer needed it. The prophets hadnot prevented the Jews’ exiles to Babylonia and Assyria centuries before, andtheir continued destabilizing presence would only lead to their destructionagain, this time by the Romans. In addition, the kings of the independentnations of Israel and Judea had disappeared. Therefore, the most important andinfluential audience to whom the prophets preached no longer existed. Theprophets’ time had passed.The rabbis also used the canonization of scripture to promulgate the notion thatprophecy was no more. By closing off the Hebrew Bible, a prophetic text, to anyadditional books, they implied that no contemporary individual’s utterancesqualified as prophetic and therefore worthy of inclusion in the canon.Canonization also suggested that people no longer needed prophecy to know God’sword because of its ready availability in an authorized text. If the “newIsrael,” the nascent Christian religion, could not tack on their “prophetic”narratives to a sealed canon, they had no claim to prophetic authority, at leastnot within the Jewish stream.DID PROPHECY REALLY END?Contrary to their general declaration, the early rabbis conceded that prophecycontinued in their time. They referred to people in Israel who are “if notprophets, then the sons of prophets” (Pesachim 66b). If one awakens from a dreamand a verse of scripture “falls into one’s mouth,” this is a “small prophecy”(Berachot 55b). Some sages sought answers in dreams or nighttime visions toquestions they could not solve in normal waking consciousness, and consideredthese answers prophetic (Bava metzia 107b). Rabbinic lore is replete withreferences to the bat kol, the “daughter” or “echo” of a “voice.” This auditoryphenomenon transmits God’s word to its recipients, usually one or several rabbisinvolved in solving a moral, exegetical, or legal dilemma (Yoma 9b). Halevi,among the medieval Jewish philosophers, states that the Talmudic sages composed“with God’s help.”8 [part0038.html#fn97]All of these examples lead to the conclusion that the “end of prophecy” pointsto the end of a particular type that belonged to a group of prophets whose ranksincluded Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel. The rabbis seem to have legislated theend of canonical prophecy, but they tacitly accepted the continuing existence ofthe non-canonical type among their ranks.PROPHECY AFTER THE PROPHETSDuring the late Second Temple period and afterward, those outside theinstitution of the rabbinate continued to claim prophetic stature, and theJewish population of Judea regarded them in that light. As Rebecca Gray, authorof Prophetic Figures in the Late Second Temple Jewish Palestine, notes: “Peoplesaid and did in Josephus’*125 [part0037.html#ft125] time very much the same sortof things classical prophets said and did.”9 [part0038.html#fn98] In addition,“prophetic” books continued to appear; in particular, the Apocrypha andPseudepigrapha. Both are collections of works by Jews and early non-JewishChristians, who for the sake of authoritativeness, attributed them to ancientbiblical personalities, such as Moses and the twelve sons of Jacob.10[part0038.html#fn99] Some of these works found their way into the New Testament,but the redactors of the Hebrew Bible did not include them. The content andstyle of the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha are similar, and are replete withtypical prophetic features, describing an “almost psychedelic world.”11[part0038.html#fn100]Certain rabbis who lived after the Talmudic and Second Temple eras also attaineda prophetic reputation.12 [part0038.html#fn101] Even our medieval Jewishphilosophers admitted to their own prophetic or prophecy-like experiences. Inhis commentary to the verse, Rashi tells us how he arrived at his interpretationof Exodus 28:4: “I don’t know but my heart tells me.” And Maimonides notes howhe attained to a certain insight: “These ideas presented themselves like aprophetic revelation.”13 [part0038.html#fn102] We most often associatepost-Maimonidean spiritual practices and states with the thirteenth-centurySpanish kabbalist Abraham Abulafia.14 [part0038.html#fn103] Soon thereafter, thehighly visionary kabbalistic school of Isaac Luria rose up in Ottoman Palestinein the sixteenth century.15 [part0038.html#fn104] The eighteenth century founderof the Hassidic movement, the Baal Shem Tov, recounted numerous propheticexperiences quite similar to those we find in the Hebrew Bible.16[part0038.html#fn105]SUMMARYFrom a naturalistic point of view, concluding that prophecy ended—or survivesonly as an impulse for good, beauty, or knowledge17 [part0038.html#fn106]—is nottenable. I see no reason to assert that the biological and metaphysicalmechanisms we’ve discussed, excluding the miraculous withholding of prophecy, nolonger operate much as they always have. Perhaps, then, it is more accurate toframe the discussion by saying that while canonical prophecy ended millenniaago, non-canonical prophecy has continued, albeit standing much more at theperiphery of normative Judaism than it did in the distant past.If, on the other hand, one wishes to believe that no manner of prophecy existsany longer because God has decided to withhold it, there is nothing preventingus from doing everything possible to bring about its renewal. On the contrary,we read repeatedly in the Hebrew Bible that following God’s guidelines willresult in humanity’s redemption, one of whose features is widespread prophecy.By thoroughly understanding prophecy’s nature and mechanisms, we may use thatknowledge to make ourselves more qualified for prophecy if and when the timecomes that God chooses to grant it again."},{"pageContent":"22The Once and Future ProphetAn early subtitle for this book contained the word birthright, as in prophecybeing our birthright. I composed this subtitle with the notion in mind thatprophecy is a type of spiritual experience to which we all have access, despitenormative Judaism claiming it disappeared thousands of years ago. I laterdecided to remove the word from the book’s subtitle because prophecy and how itworks are much more complex than I first envisioned. I now see certain elementsof prophecy as a birthright but not the experience itself. By removing the wordfrom this book’s subtitle, I wished to forestall any simplistic interpretationof the term to suggest that we somehow “deserve” prophecy.THE IDEA OF A BIRTHRIGHTA birthright is a right, privilege, or possession one receives by virtue ofbirth or at the time of birth. It may be extrinsic to a person, such as wealth,or be intrinsic, such as race. The word also relates to an inheritance. One mayassume a birthright at the moment of birth, after attaining a certain readinessor maturity, or after crossing a threshold. That threshold may require effort onour part to cross; for example, succeeding in an academic or spiritual course ofstudy. Or it may come to us simply by attaining a particular biological state,such as sexual maturity or a specific age. Reaching the appropriate milestoneindicates a greater likelihood of receiving, understanding, or utilizing one’sbirthright.We may be unaware of our birthright, passively allowing it to exert itsinfluence, both positive and negative, on us. Others learn about and takeadvantage of its various elements in order to excel in ways otherwiseimpossible. We might reject our birthright or exchange it for another.One element of prophecy that I believe is our birthright is its form: itsvisions, voices, emotions, and other phenomenological elements. The brain-mindcomplex that nearly all of us possess at birth appears to contain these forms ina latent and easily and reliably accessible manner, as the DMT researchconvincingly demonstrated. We can stimulate the imaginative facultypharmacologically in order to occasion prophetic phenomenology. Thephenomenology is the body of prophecy, so to speak, its outward appearance.However, the soul of prophecy, its essential feature, is the prophetic messageand is not so easily accessible. According to the medieval Jewish philosophers,other factors are at work: the operation of the rational faculty and God’s will.Another element of prophecy that is the birthright of those born intoAbrahamitic religions or cultures is the Hebrew Bible. This is the paradigmaticprophetic text of all major Western religions, one that permeates Westerncivilization at a nearly cellular level. Those born and raised within culturesso infused by the Hebrew Bible may not like this fact, or may even beunconscious of it. Despite one’s ignorance of or resistance to the Hebrew’sBible’s influence, the prophetic model of spirituality is much more a birthrightto such an individual than Asian religious models or Latin American shamanicones. Adopting these foreign systems is instead an estrangement from thousandsof years of collective memory.The possibility of our becoming qualified for prophecy constitutes anotheraspect of a birthright. We have determined that the prophetic state requireshighly developed rational and imaginative faculties. One’s state of readiness toreceive overflow from God or His intermediaries is based on the condition ofthese faculties. While the final decision to bestow prophecy lies with God, wehave within our means the ability to enhance the quality of our minds’ function,which in turn makes prophecy more likely.What then are the implications of the Hebrew Bible’s model of prophecy forcontemporary spiritual seekers? In particular, how might the theoneurologicalmodel, which evolved from my study of the endogenous psychedelic substance DMTand medieval Jewish metaphysics, influence the renaissance of a contemporarystream of prophetic experience? In the material that follows, I suggest that inour effort to become qualified for prophecy, we consider the judicious use ofpsychedelic agents such as DMT to enhance the imagination. And in order todevelop our rational faculty, we study, learn, and practice the propheticteachings that the Hebrew Bible contains.THE IMAGINATIONAccording to the medieval Jewish philosophers, the imaginative faculty is themore physical, or corporeal, of the two relevant mental functions. Therefore, inaddition to an optimal genetic endowment, other factors such as good health,diet, and avoidance of toxins will optimize its operation. Toxins includephysical substances as well as negative emotions and actions, such as hatred,envy, theft, lying, and exposing ourselves to violent and otherwise degradingentertainment.In addition to maintaining the health of the imaginative faculty, we also maywork toward enhancing its function. A more highly developed imagination willcontain more cogent or intelligible raw materials with which to manifest Godlyemanation. Such an enhanced imagination also may provide a more suitable matrix,and thereby increase one’s readiness, to receive that emanation in the firstplace. Therefore, the Hebrew Bible provides guidelines for maximizing physicaland social health through the diet as well as cultivating piety and virtuousemotions and actions such as love, modesty, charity, and empathy. It alsoencourages exposing our external senses to beautiful and uplifting input.As the imagination is the more physical mental function, it is logical tointervene in its operation using physical substances such as DMT and otherpsychedelics. The overwhelming similarities between the imaginative componentsof the prophetic and DMT states bespeak the rational basis of such a suggestion.DMT’s effects on the imagination, while profound, do not account for the entirespectrum of the imaginative characteristics of prophecy; i.e., itsphenomenology. Let’s look at two examples of this lack of fit.The Spoken WordMost of us assume that when a biblical figure experiences prophecy, he or shehears a spoken voice originating outside the head. If this were the case, itwould differ from the DMT experience, in which the verbal exchange usually butnot always occurred telepathically, mind to mind and not mouth to ear. Among themedievalists, only Saadiah proposes that God creates a sound in the objectiveworld that one hears with the external ears. All the other authors understandthe prophetic experience as subjective, something that the mind’s eye sees andthe mind’s ear hears. However, if the Hebrew Bible is referring to words thatsomeone hears outside the head, are there endogenous compounds that reliablyinduce this experience?One such family of pharmacological agents is the anticholinergic compounds.These substances block the effects of the ubiquitous neurotransmitteracetylcholine and include atropine, scopolamine, and belladonna. At high doses,such agents produce auditory hallucinations, including that of the spoken voice.Anticholinergic compounds occur in many plants and make up part of thecontemporary pharmacopeia for the treatment of medical conditions such asurinary bladder problems and movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease.Endogenous anticholinergic substances occur in mammals, including humans.1[part0038.html#fn107]However, these voices occasioned by anticholinergic substances occur in thecontext of a delirium, a state of profound confusion and fluctuating levels ofconsciousness. Maintenance of mental clarity is the rule in prophecy, and thismilitates against a role for similar endogenous substances in propheticexperience. However, there are several subtypes of the central nervous systemreceptor that anticholinergic drugs influence, and it may be that some mediateconfusion and others affect audition. Future research will help shed light onthis subject.KavodWhile descriptions of the visual properties of kavod—God’s glory—and those ofthe typical DMT experience do overlap, those of kavod do not possess acomparable degree of complexity. In addition, kavod’s “cloudlike” nature withwhich one may merge or “become one with” also alludes to its uniqueness. Theseproperties suggest that another DMT-like compound may contribute to kavod’sphenomenology. A strong candidate is 5-methoxy-DMT (5-MeO-DMT), an endogenousmammalian and plant psychedelic substance with profound subjective effects.While no rigorous scientific data exist, anecdotal reports indicate that5-MeO-DMT administration elicits a rapidly developing, intense, physicallyimmobilizing, and dissociative state much like that resulting from DMT. Inaddition, 5-MeO-DMT appears to elicit several kavodlike experiences more oftenthan DMT, such as the visual apprehension of a formless white light, loss of thesense of self, and a highly unitary state of absorption.2 [part0038.html#fn108]It is of great interest to compare the phenomenology of the DMT and 5-MeO-DMTexperiences in the same people, as well as comparing descriptions of the lattercompound with those of kavod. It also may prove valuable to compare 5-MeO-DMT’seffects to descriptions of other religious traditions’ mystical-unitiveexperiences, Western and Eastern. If research demonstrates significant areas ofoverlap, we may propose a role for this endogenous compound in those states aswell.Kavod is the only prophetic phenomenon that appears to the masses. While we knowthat stress raises levels of DMT and 5-MeO-DMT in rodents,3[part0038.html#fn109] it may be that less stress is necessary to stimulateproduction of the latter compound than the former. If this were so,5-MeO-DMT-mediated experiences in the masses would be more likely than thosethat DMT mediates.THE RATIONAL FACULTYThe theoneurological model proposes that DMT primarily affects the imaginativefaculty, and this is most likely why it elicits an experience with relativelyhigher aesthetic than informational content. How might we enhance the capacitiesof the rational faculty to maximize our attaining to the prophetic message? Hereis where the role of education, study, and training come to the fore. Indeed,Maimonides believes that the greatest boon of the peaceful reign of the messiahis that it will allow us to engage in these activities undisturbed in order toperfect our rational faculties and thus qualify for prophecy.4[part0038.html#fn110]The medieval Jewish philosophers believe that the rational faculty is moreamenable to education and training than the imaginative. Study strengthens anddevelops the intellect through a process of transforming potential knowledgeinto actual knowledge. Education is part of a positive feedback mechanism. Itincreases the function of the intellect, which then in turn is more capable ofattaining to additional knowledge. Such training helps us recognize, understand,and communicate prophecy’s content more effectively.Studying the Hebrew Bible occupies the highest rank in the hierarchy ofintellectual pursuits, but our medieval authors additionally advise mastery ofgrammar and philology, mathematics, philosophy, astronomy and astrology, andother areas of natural science. Expertise in these fields helps us comprehendthe scope of God’s creation. As a result, we draw closer to Him—that is,approach prophecy—through love for and awe of His creating and sustaining thisunfathomably complex universe.Biological options also exist and deserve future research; for example,identifying and utilizing compounds that stimulate the rational faculty. Suchsubstances may increase one’s readiness to receive genuine divine overflow andincrease the intellect’s ability to interpret and communicate the contents ofthe imagination resulting from that efflux. Molecules affecting dopamineneurotransmission are likely candidates, and dopamine-related exogenous andendogenous stimulants impact some of the previously discussed cognitivecharacteristics of prophecy.5 [part0038.html#fn111]Interestingly, early clinicalresearch combined stimulants with psychedelics to enhance, prolong, and augmentthe latter’s effects, particularly in psychotherapy.6 [part0038.html#fn112] Thispoints to the potential value of modifying imaginative and rational faculties intandem when using biological means to draw down Godly influence.Enhancing the rational faculty pharmacologically, however, raises the questionof the source of the prophetic message, an issue that I previously discussed. IfGodly efflux simply shines a light on information that the mind already somehowpossesses, then such biological interventions may potentially elicit trueprophecy by similarly accessing embedded information. However, if the messageresides in the emanation itself, whatever information someone receives while inthis enhanced state would not be prophetic, even if it were true.HASTENING THE ENDPsychological, spiritual, and especially biological attempts to attain prophecyby our own devices raise the notion of “hastening the end”; that is,precipitating the salvific end of days that I have referred to throughout thisbook. Widespread prophecy is one of the hallmarks of this future world. Thus,accelerating the end means accelerating the establishment of widespreadprophetic experience. Since it appears that the world to come also sharesfeatures with a non-corporeal DMT-like state, hastening this transition has evengreater implications. That is, rather than simply catalyzing widespreadprophecy, we may also find ourselves attempting to accelerate a mass entranceinto a nonphysical plane.The Hebrew Bible’s attitude toward hastening the end is highly ambivalent. Itconsistently encourages us to act and believe in accordance with God’sguidelines, as this will speed the onset of salvation. At the same time, itinculcates patience: Let not the believer expect it soon (Isa. 28:16), andpoints out the merit of patience: [Why] . . . disturb the love while it stillgratifies? (Song of Songs 8:4). The text also suggests a mixture of patience andurgency, as God tells Isaiah: In its time, I will hasten it (Isa. 60:22).Similarly, Habakkuk notes: He shall speak of the end, and it shall not fail.Although it tarry, wait for it, for it shall surely come. It shall not delay(Hab. 2:3).It therefore appears that if we merit it, God will hasten the end. If we do not,it will occur at its appointed time, whenever that may be! One way to merit theend, when prophecy is universal, is to be deserving of it. While the HebrewBible advises adherence to God’s precepts as conducing to that time, medievalJewish philosophers expand upon this concept by teaching that we becomedeserving by perfecting our imaginative and rational faculties. Up until now, wecould hasten the end only through study and virtue. Now we have the additionaltools of psychedelic pharmacology and biology.It is likely that at some point in the future we will have obtained as detailedas possible an understanding of the biological changes conducing to prophecy, tothe extent that they actually do so. A further step in the direction of makingprophecy and other spiritual experiences universally available would then bethrough genetic engineering.7 [part0038.html#fn113] We may be able to turn onthe production of endogenous compounds that stimulate the imaginative andrational faculties. The religious, ethical, and moral questions that thistechnology would raise are myriad, but it is not too early to begin consideringthe implications of such a project. If we can modify brain function in thismanner, we will, and doing so wisely and for the greatest good will be more of achallenge than accomplishing the science itself. The question then is not: Canwe perfect our faculties by whatever means at our disposal? Rather, it is: Towhat purpose?*126 [part0037.html#ft126]PRACTICAL APPLICATIONSNow that we have examined the possible mechanisms, both biological andmetaphysical, that may underlie the prophetic and DMT states, let’s turn ourattention to the practical implications of the theoneurological model.In the Research CenterA rich research agenda emerges from the above discussion. One avenue is tocharacterize the effects of endogenous and exogenous psychoactive compounds onthe rational and imaginative faculties using state-of-theart biological andpsychological methodologies.Another avenue of inquiry is to determine the role of endogenous DMT and relatedcompounds in those experiencing prophecy-like states resulting from any method:study of the Hebrew Bible, dreams, prayer, ritual observance, chant, dance, andkabbalistic meditation. If such individuals demonstrate greater DMT activitythan that found in normal waking consciousness, such data would support a rolefor this endogenous psychedelic compound in mediating the states these methodselicit.In addition to establishing how particular agents modify the imagination andintellect, the more salient issue is to determine to what extent they actuallyelicit prophecy-like experiences and not simply their individual constituents.To answer this question, it will be necessary to develop suitable metrics fordetermining how “prophetic” a particular state is. Maimonides’ hierarchy ofprophecy that I noted in chapter 8, Prophet and Prophecy, may help researchersaddress this question.Approaching this issue from the other direction, we may wish to more rigorouslydetermine the “psychedelic” properties of prophecy. One approach to this task isto apply the rating scale I developed in quantifying the DMT effect to recordsof biblical prophetic experience. This would involve using the same statisticaltests of reliability and validity we applied to the DMT data. In the context ofour project of reclaiming prophecy, both these sets of data comparing the DMTand prophetic states will aid in designing research intended to develop theimagination and intellect so as to make prophecy more likely.It is important to reiterate that similar phenomenology is not equivalent to asimilar message, despite the phenomenology being necessary for the transmissionof that message. Maimonides’ hierarchy and my rating scale both emphasizeelements of the imaginative faculty and not the information content of theexperiences. The goal of this project is not to resurrect a certain set ofexperiences but rather to reestablish access to the reservoir of informationthat flows through true prophecy. Here the metrics for the “true” and “false”prophetic message are considerably less quantifiable. This is a potentiallyfruitful area of collaboration for scientific researchers and enlightenedclerics.Finally, in the context of clinical research that directly elicits spiritualexperience, we may build on historical precedent. The Good Friday Experiment atBoston University’s Marsh Chapel in the 1960s demonstrated that psilocybinadministration to divinity school students brought about mystical experiencesmore often than did a placebo.8 [part0038.html#fn114] A more sophisticated studyrecently replicated these findings.9 [part0038.html#fn115] However, both groupsemphasized mystical-unitive states rather than interactive-relational ones.Future studies must look for and characterize differences in phenomenology,message, and impact between these two types.In the House of WorshipA house of worship refers to any religious environment: a synagogue, church, ormosque; a site of communal study; or one’s private quarters. In this context,one is seeking a deeper understanding of the prophetic text contained in theHebrew Bible.PSYCHEDELICS IN THE HOUSE OF WORSHIPUsing psychedelics to strengthen the imaginative faculty while studying theHebrew Bible may provide access to more cogent and highly articulated imaginalexperiences of scripture than would occur in normal waking consciousness. Thisenhancement of imaginative forms—visual, auditory, emotional, and others—mayprove useful in working with the entire text and not only with records ofostensible prophetic experiences. This material includes law, ritual, prayers,songs, wisdom, and even the seemingly banal genealogies and narratives.*127[part0037.html#ft127]Here, the principle of dose and response will play an important role. Lowerdoses of a psychedelic substance may allow someone to sit in a chair, read thetext, associate new meanings with it, and converse with study partners or fellowcongregants. Higher doses would necessitate laying down the text and attendingto the visions it has elicited in a more private, internalized manner.Judicious use of psychedelics also may aid in the effectiveness of otheractivities one engages in with the intent of drawing down divine influence. Forexample, most of the prayers of the Jewish liturgy were composed by rabbis in aninspired, prophecy-like state; thus, using a psychedelic substance during prayermay bring one closer to that state. This is conceptually akin to the use ofpsychedelics to aid meditation, another spiritual technology. However, ratherthan meditating on the nature of the mind, body, or phenomenal existence inorder to free oneself from the cycle of birth and death, one prays to YHVH ofthe Hebrew Bible for mercy, love, healing, and wisdom.The Hebrew Bible ranks the Sabbath, Friday sunset to Saturday sunset, as theholiest day of the week. It is a time of rest, rejuvenation, prayer, study, andcommunal activities, all intended to increase one’s intimacy with God. Just ascertain places may be more conducive to spiritual experience, includingprophecy, certain times may be as well.10 [part0038.html#fn116] The Sabbath andits associated activities, in addition to other holy days in the Jewishliturgical calendar such as the New Year and Day of Atonement, may thus be anespecially auspicious time for working with the psychedelic drug experience.The mitzvot*128 [part0037.html#ft128] are the behavioral and attitudinalprecepts that the Hebrew Bible records God instructing us to perform. They serveto demonstrate and strengthen our love and awe of God, in addition to providingintrinsic social and individual benefits. In the social sphere, they revolvearound the Golden Rule. With respect to our relationship with God, their intentis to abolish idolatry. The rabbis have added many mitzvot to those already inthe Hebrew Bible, such as lighting the Sabbath candles, celebrating the holidayof Hanukkah, and using the traditional prayer shawl.The mitzvot are concrete examples of the prophetic message “in action.” JudahHalevi believes that they affect the soul, and we feel this subjectively. Wemight consider enhancing our subjective experience of performing mitzvot throughthe psychedelic drug state. Doing so may allow us to approach closer toprophecy, inasmuch as those who received these precepts did so through the aegisof that spiritual experience.RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN PSYCHEDELICS AND WORSHIPTwo syncretic religions in the West with U.S. government protection now use apsychedelic sacrament within a model that includes biblical notions andsensibilities. These are the Native American Church, in whose ceremoniesparticipants consume the mescaline-containing peyote cactus,11[part0038.html#fn117] and the Brazilian Christian-spiritist syncretic churches,which use DMT-containing ayahuasca.12 [part0038.html#fn118] These two churches,neither older than two hundred years, amalgamate Christian and indigenousreligious beliefs and practices and have begun to bridge psychedelicconsciousness with Western spirituality.The next stage in this evolution of joining Western religious models with thepsychedelic drug experience would more explicitly incorporate these substancesinto an extant Western religion, rather than developing a new tradition aroundthe substance. Within the context of our project, this could occur in anestablished Jewish denomination in which crucial clerical and scholarlyexpertise in text, history, ethics, and rituals would be available. In addition,such a modification of preexisting Jewish religious practice would be moreamenable to peer-review and consensus development than creating a new religionout of whole cloth.In the FieldMost people take and will continue to take psychedelic drugs, including DMT, innon-research and non-religious settings. From my observations, it appears thatthese substances’ effects on the imaginative function are channeled primarilytoward hedonic purposes such as increasing aesthetic, emotional, and relatedexperiences. The minority who do attempt to utilize these drugs’ potential toelicit spiritual effects do not have access to a suitable Western intellectualscaffolding—a Western psychedelic theology—upon which to stand for this task. Touse the metaphysical concept, their rational faculty lacks proper notions. As aresult, they have turned to Eastern religious or Latin American shamanicsystems, or they may invoke a mélange of New Age ideas, combining them with asimilarly eclectic infusion of psychotherapeutic concepts and practices.The ideas this book contains provide an alternative model. I encourage those whotake psychedelic drugs for spiritual purposes to turn to the Hebrew Bible forguidance in strengthening their rational faculty in order to infuse therelatively message-poor but imagination-rich drug state with additional meaning.This Western prophetic text presents a culturally resonant model, employingWestern “indigenous” concepts, vocabulary, narratives, and figures. One may viewthe contents of the psychedelic state through the lenses of the Golden Rule andits corollaries, God’s nature and activities, the events at Mount Sinai, Adamand Eve’s experience in the Garden of Eden, and so on. With respect to“psychedelic wisdom,” Proverbs, Job, and Ecclesiastes may similarly engage theWestern mind at a more culturally resonant level than analogous Buddhistphilosophical texts.While recognizing the shortcomings of Buddhism for providing a fully cogentmodel for the spiritual properties of the psychedelic state, it is alsoimportant to acknowledge the value of Eastern religious meditation practices quapractices. They may assist our attempts to attain prophecy with or withoutpsychedelic drug augmentation by helping us concentrate and step away frompersonal preoccupations and temporary upsets that interfere with a clearapprehension of any experience.The prophetic model of the Hebrew Bible also may help us incorporate and evolvebeyond shamanism’s invoking and manipulating non-corporeal spirits and forces ofnature. This, for example, would provide the basis for asking a being we beholdwho is its God, or seeking healing and wisdom from the highest possible source,the creator and sustainer of that spirit. In addition, the Hebrew Bible provideswelcome ethical and moral guidelines regarding how to apply the powers andinsights resulting from these states, something the shamanic model to a greatdegree presently lacks.Dream interpretation is another potentially fruitful application of this methodthat combines knowledge of prophecy with the ability of psychedelic drugs tostimulate the imaginative faculty. While such work might take place in aresearch setting or a religious one, it is broad enough to include in ourpresent discussion. The Hebrew Bible and the medieval Jewish philosophersconsider accurate dream interpretation to be a variety of prophecy; i.e., Godcommunicating His message to humans. As Joseph states, when beginning tointerpret the Egyptian king’s dream: It is God who will respond to Pharaoh’swelfare (Gen. 41:16). If psychedelics help us attain a prophecy-like state, theymay thus facilitate our ability to interpret dreams more accurately.RISKSAttempting to restore the prophetic stream by utilizing the psychedelic drugstate is not without potential risks. These risks are clinical, legal, andspiritual.Clinical and LegalPsychedelic drugs are extraordinarily powerful mind-altering substances, andtheir use can lead to serious psychological problems,13 [part0038.html#fn119]even in religious settings.14 [part0038.html#fn120] While it is possible tominimize the occurrence of these adverse effects with careful screening,preparation, supervision, and follow-up of drug sessions, it is impossible toavoid them entirely. Thus, it behooves anyone embarking on this venture toprepare to the utmost extent to maximize potential benefits and minimizepotential risks.15 [part0038.html#fn121] And except for a very small number ofresearch projects and religious settings, possession of these drugs is illegalin most of the world.False ProphecyWhile clinical and legal adverse effects may result from possession or misguideduse of psychedelics for spiritual purposes, their adverse spiritual effects aremore subtle. These lead us again into the realm of false prophecy, a notion thatsomehow we simply cannot avoid. If we are to use the power of the psychedelicdrug state for prophetic purposes, we need guidelines to determine the truth orfalsity of the message we receive, either from our own experiences of“experimental prophecy” or those of others. Are we apprehending God’s overflowupon us or our wishful thinking and projections? If there are elements of both,which will most likely the case, how do we distinguish between them? Becausemedical scientists know as little about prophecy as religious authorities knowabout DMT, false prophecy, like the true variety, is a critical point of sharedconcern and collaboration.While the Hebrew Bible and the medieval Jewish philosophers give examples oftrue and false prophecy, provide guidelines in assessing the putative prophetand his or her message, and speculate regarding mechanisms, there areunfortunately no hard and fast rules for distinguishing between the two types.One critical factor all agree on is the nature of the message. Is it consistentwith the ethos pervading the Hebrew Bible? In particular, does it conform to thetext’s two primary messages? These are the practice of the Golden Rule, theessential revealed teaching of the Hebrew Bible. The other is the love and aweof God and God alone; that is, the abolition of idolatry. Various intellectual,cultural, and spiritual forces have lulled many of us into moral and spiritualrelativism; for example, “right and wrong are relative” or “God is simply oneexperience among many.” However, the prophetic message is anything but insipid,and its contemporary application anything but facile.16 [part0038.html#fn122]We must also examine carefully the character of anyone, including ourselves, whoclaims prophetic inspiration. What are the person’s motivations, the degree towhich that individual wishes to serve him- or herself or the larger world? Andhow consistent is that person’s life with the message he or she is expressing?"},{"pageContent":"23Concluding RemarksTwo related questions motivated me to write both DMT: The Spirit Molecule andDMT and the Soul of Prophecy: What is the DMT effect? And why does the DMT statematter? The first question led me to “enlarge the discussion” regarding the DMTexperience. However, enlarging the discussion by taking it into the furthestreaches of science did not immediately answer the second question, which we mayalso express by our familiar refrain: “If so, so what?” To determine the meaningof the DMT state, I needed to expand the scope of my investigations even furtherthan I had anticipated. This then led me to the Hebrew Bible’s notion ofprophecy. There I found a solution to the task of determining the personal andsocial meaning of the results of my drug studies as well as novel metaphysicalmechanisms to explain them. Both charges combined to push me out of the familiarand relatively well-circumscribed confines of the scientific worldview and intothe religious one that takes such a prominent place in this book.My initial intuition that the Hebrew Bible contained the model I was seekingimpelled me to pursue various topics as they appeared. Some were dead ends, andothers resulted in valuable discoveries, either in and of themselves or forwhere they subsequently pointed. During the course of this project, I haveimmersed myself in the twenty-four books of the Hebrew Bible; learned theastonishing power of the biblical Hebrew language; and gained insights into thesocial, historical, theological, and metaphysical worlds of both the originaltext and the medieval Jewish philosophers who labored so mightily to explain it.The final outcome has been the development of a new model—theoneurology—for aparticular type of spiritual experience with striking similarities to the DMTeffect: Hebrew biblical prophecy. In this model, the contemporary scientific andthe medieval metaphysical- religious worldviews meet as equals. It provides atheoretical framework for certain practical applications for students of theHebrew Bible and for those who use psychedelic drugs for spiritual purposes.Let me now close this book by summarizing its main findings. 1. The effects of administering the endogenous psychedelic substance DMT in a controlled clinical research setting replicated many of the features we read about in the Hebrew Bible’s accounts of prophetic experience. These resemblances are especially pronounced in the perceptual sphere, but emotional, physical, cognitive, and volitional similarities also are quite striking. 2. The interactive-relational properties of the two states also are highly congruent. In this they differ profoundly from the unitive-mystical state which has become the default position for much of contemporary clinical research into spirituality as well as the goal for those who use psychedelic drugs for spiritual purposes. 3. While the informational content of the DMT and prophetic states overlap to some degree, that of the canonical prophets is much more highly articulated, profound, and meaningful. We can easily determine this by noting the enduring and pervasive effects of the prophetic message on world civilization. While the message of the non-canonical prophets is substantially less voluble, it also possesses a truth value that also far outshines the DMT one. Herein lies the essential meaning of any spiritual experience, prophetic or psychedelic. That meaning resides in the truth and beneficial effects of its message. 4. Utilizing the medieval Jewish philosophers’ model of God, God’s intermediaries, emanation, and the rational and imaginative faculties of the human mind, I have proposed mechanisms by which to explain the similarities and differences between the DMT and prophetic states. The DMT experience predominantly reflects enhancement of the imaginative faculty, whereas the prophetic one also includes the operation of a highly developed rational faculty as well as God’s will to bestow the state. 5. This model suggests both pharmacological and educational approaches to enhancing the likelihood of contemporary prophetic experience. Study of the Hebrew Bible and the natural sciences will enhance the rational faculty, and the judicious use of psychedelic drugs will enhance the imaginative one. True prophecy—bestowal of divine emanation—is more likely to take place in someone who is qualified, one in whom exists the highest possible development of these two vital mental functions.For an educated, contemporary Western secularist, the most challenging aspect ofthe theoneurological model’s reliance on medieval Jewish metaphysics is the rolethat God plays in it. According to this model, God created and sustains all thenatural and moral laws of the universe, and prophecy is nothing other than adirect relationship with that God. Any model for prophecy that relies on theHebrew Bible must either accept this theocentric orientation or not. Byrejecting it, the text immediately becomes metaphoric, and the medieval Jewishphilosophers rarely approach the text metaphorically to derive theirsophisticated metaphysics. The value of their model is that, paradoxically, wecan study it using modern science.Thoughtfully grafting the medieval model on the biological one leads to aGod-based theoneurology that provides a counterpoint to a brain-basedneurotheology. The biological concomitants of prophecy are how God communicateswith us, rather than how the brain creates the impression of that communication.A faith-based individual may find confirmation of his or her beliefs in such aproposition, whereas a secularist may find it of value to conduct a thoughtexperiment exploring the implications of such a model.The disproportionate aesthetic features of the psychedelic drug state relativeto its intellectual ones is of critical importance, as it reflects its primaryeffects on the imaginative rather than the rational faculty. While biblicalaesthetics are at least as impressive as those of the DMT experience, it is theprophetic message that has exerted the more profound and enduring effect on theworld. The verbal teachings of the Hebrew Bible’s God and His angels gave birthto and continue to sustain Western law, theology, ethics and morality,psychology, natural and social science, history, finance, and government. Incontrast, a uniquely psychedelic influence on these foundations of Westerncivilization as yet is nowhere near as visible.This minimal non-aesthetic impact may be due to the relative paucity of thepsychedelic experience’s message or the lack of a culturally appropriatereligious and intellectual model for understanding and communicating it. Thetheoneurological model provides potential solutions to these challenges. Itsuggests strengthening the rational faculty through appropriate education inaddition to using the Hebrew Bible’s vocabulary and concepts to mine thepsychedelic state for its message.For those intent on attaining a deeper understanding of the Hebrew Bible,studying it with the judicious assistance of the psychedelic drug state mayprovide greater resonance with the mind out of which the text emerged; that is,the mind of prophecy. And for those seeking an intellectual and religiousfoundation upon which to interpret and apply the contemporary Westernpsychedelic drug experience, Hebrew biblical prophecy, sharing as many featuresas it does with the DMT state, may provide just that foundation."},{"pageContent":"AppendixSacred Texts: Translations, Commentaries, Philosophical Works, and ScholarsI have organized the three sections of this appendix chronologically.

Babylonia is present-day Iraq.*3 [part0007.html#rt3]. Hebrew for “living things.”†4 [part0007.html#rt4]. The convention “Book X:Y” refers to a particular book,chapter, and verse in the Hebrew Bible (the “Old Testament”). Here the notationindicates Ezekiel, chapter 1, verse 1, to chapter 2, verse 1.‡5 [part0007.html#rt5]. This volunteer’s pseudonym is “Saul” in DMT: The SpiritMolecule, but because Saul is also the name of a biblical figure, I changed hispseudonym to “Leo.”*6 [part0007.html#rt6]. (DMT, pg.) refers to my book DMT: The Spirit Molecule,followed by the page number on which these excerpts appear.*7 [part0009.html#rt7]. Lysergic acid diethylamide*8 [part0009.html#rt8]. The psychedelic experience, with its uniqueconstellation of effects, may result from non-drug methods. These includedrumming, chanting, prolonged hyperventilation, fasting, sleep deprivation, andothers. However, the psychedelic drugs are the most reliable means of inducingthis syndrome. How any of these non-drug methods affect endogenous psychedelicchemistry is a critical research question.*9 [part0009.html#rt9]. Interpretation of text, especially biblical.†10 [part0009.html#rt10]. I later learned that Dr. Freedman did considerreligion a more useful discipline than psychiatry in understanding and utilizingthese drugs’ effects.3 [part0038.html#fn5]*11 [part0009.html#rt11]. For example, my speculations that elevations ofendogenous DMT occur in dreams and near-death states, that DMT and the pinealgland play a role in attaining “personhood” during fetal development, andothers.*12 [part0009.html#rt12]. My exclusive attention to Hebrew Bible prophecy andits subsequent explication by Jewish thinkers is not a sign of disrespect for ordisinterest in Islamic and Christian prophecy. It has taken me many years tobegin understanding just the Hebrew Bible and Jewish views of prophecy. PerhapsI will address Islamic and Christian prophecy in future editions.*13 [part0010.html#rt13]. The dictionary upon which I primarily rely is the Funk& Wagnalls Standard Dictionary of the English Language, International Edition(New York: Funk & Wagnalls, 1963). Because the meanings of words may change overtime, I also have referred to the Random House Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary,2nd ed. (New York: Random House Reference, 2005) and The American HeritageDictionary of the English Language, 5th ed. (New York: Houghton MifflinHarcourt, 2011). It is reassuring to note how minor the differences are amongthe three dictionaries’ definitions, even across the span of forty to fiftyyears.*14 [part0011.html#rt14]. In addition, fascination with the newly describednear-death experience contemporaneously drew attention to yet another highlyaltered state of consciousness, albeit one under much less voluntary control.1[part0038.html#fn10]*15 [part0011.html#rt15]. Other drugs sometimes receive the name psychedelic butare not technically members of the “classical” compounds. MDMA (“ecstasy”) is amethamphetamine derivative with qualitatively different psychological andpharmacological effects than those of LSD, psilocybin, and DMT. Ketamine and theclosely related drug PCP, as well as Salvia divinorum, share subjective effectswith the psychedelic drugs, but their pharmacology is distinct.†16 [part0011.html#rt16]. Neurotransmitters are chemical substances that providecommunication among nerve cells and between nerve cells and adjacent tissues,such as muscle or endocrine glands. For an in-depth discussion of these issues,see chapter 1 of DMT: The Spirit Molecule.*17 [part0011.html#rt17]. Conservative Judaism is one of the three major sectsof contemporary Judaism. It occupies the middle ground between Orthodoxtraditionalism and Reform liberalism. Newer sects include Reconstructionist andRenewal.*18 [part0011.html#rt18]. As I discuss in chapter 5, the interactive andrelational psychedelic-like visions resulting from meditation are not Buddhism’sfinal goal. This became clear to me only after some years of study and practicewithin Zen.†19 [part0011.html#rt19]. Zen is a sect of Japanese Buddhism, arriving by way ofChina more than nine hundred years ago. Chinese Buddhism originated with theinflux of Indian teachers five hundred years earlier.‡20 [part0011.html#rt20]. This glimpse of enlightenment, or bodhicitta, is themost important stage in Buddhist training.5 [part0038.html#fn14]*21 [part0011.html#rt21]. See chapters 3 and 4 of DMT: The Spirit Molecule foran in-depth discussion of the possible role of the pineal gland inconsciousness.†22 [part0011.html#rt22]. 5-methoxy-DMT is a close chemical cousin of DMT,endogenous, and highly psychoactive. I will discuss this compound in chapter 22.‡23 [part0011.html#rt23]. We now know that DMT occurs in the mammalian pinealgland.7 [part0038.html#fn16]*24 [part0011.html#rt24]. DMT is orally inactive because enzymes in the gutbreak it down nearly instantly. In ayahuasca there is, in addition to aDMT-containing plant, another plant possessing inhibitors of the gut’sdestructive enzymes. These inhibitors are called beta-carbolines. Thebeta-carbolines inhibit the function of monoamine oxidases, the enzymes thatbreak down DMT in the stomach, blood, and liver. This combination of plants inayahuasca provides an orally active DMT formulation.*25 [part0011.html#rt25]. Psychedelics reside in the Controlled Substances Act’sSchedule I. This category includes drugs that have no known medical use, arehighly abusable, and are not safe even under medical supervision.*26 [part0012.html#rt26]. Beta-endorphin is functionally similar to opiatenarcotics and plays a role in endogenous pain and pleasure mechanisms; cortisolis a stress hormone made by the adrenal glands; prolactin regulates breast milkformation and secretion as well as sexual drive; vasopressin is similar tooxytocin, a hormone with pronounced pro-social and bonding effects; ACTH is astress hormone that triggers the production of cortisol.*27 [part0012.html#rt27]. This instrument, the Hallucinogen Rating Scale (HRS),demonstrated outstanding sensitivity to various doses of DMT. As furtherevidence of its utility, additional research groups have used this scale instudies of many other psychoactive drugs. As of 2013, more than forty scientificpapers have documented its use.*28 [part0012.html#rt28]. We used a water-soluble form of the drug, DMTfumarate. Typical psychedelic effects began at a threshold dose of 0.2 mg/kg(milligrams per kilogram) and our high dose was 0.4 mg/kg. As there areapproximately 2.2 pounds per kilogram, the maximum dose for a 150-pound, or70-kg person, was about 28 mg.*29 [part0012.html#rt29]. In this and my previous work, I use the term “beings”to describe these objects. While some volunteers referred to them as “aliens,”no one saw the typical four-foot-high, bug-eyed, gray-skinned humanoids popularin the “alien contact” literature. I prefer the term “beings” as its genericquality avoids the connotations “alien” may carry.*30 [part0012.html#rt31]. See chapters 17–20 of DMT: The Spirit Molecule.*31 [part0012.html#rt32]. Sean and Elena, discussed in chapter 16 of DMT: TheSpirit Molecule.*32 [part0012.html#rt33]. I use the terms apprehend and apprehension in theirmeaning of “laying hold of, or grasping, mentally.” Apprehending shares featureswith perceiving, but I like its greater inclusiveness, which takes into accountideas, thoughts, and beliefs, and not simply sense impressions. I am not usingapprehend in the sense of “expecting with anxious foreboding” or “to arrest orseize in the name of the law,” two other common definitions.*33 [part0012.html#rt34]. For a more in-depth discussion of these speculations,see chapter 21 of DMT: The Spirit Molecule.*34 [part0013.html#rt35]. Spiritual beings with particular characteristics suchas love, compassion, courage, energy, and so on. One may invoke their aid byprayer and other rituals.*35 [part0015.html#rt36]. For details, see chapter 20 of DMT: The SpiritMolecule.*36 [part0015.html#rt37]. Less valuable and prone to damage than a sickle.*37 [part0015.html#rt38]. A Middle Eastern language family, as well as thepeople who share both that language family and geographical proximity.†38 [part0015.html#rt39]. Judea in turn is the name of the Southern Kingdom ofIsrael. The Northern Kingdom was Samaria, or “Israel,” the home of ten of thetwelve tribes of Israel whose exile by the Assyrians in 722 BCE resulted in the“ten lost tribes of Israel.”*39 [part0015.html#rt40]. Or Tanach. Both the “ch” (or “kh”) is pronounced as aguttural throat clearing like the Scottish word loch.†40 [part0015.html#rt41]. The ancient Greek translation of the Hebrew Biblerefers to the Torah as the Pentateuch, meaning “five cases” or “five rolls.”‡41 [part0015.html#rt42]. “Minor” refers to the length of the individualprophet’s book, not his importance.*42 [part0015.html#rt43]. In this project I found great assistance in two Hebrewbiblical dictionaries: Davidson, The Analytical Hebrew and Chaldee Lexicon; andBrown, Driver, and Briggs, A Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament.*43 [part0015.html#rt44]. Astrology possessed a higher rank and reputability inmedieval times than it does today. It was an applied science consisting of anamalgam of early astronomy with psychology, medicine, and history.*44 [part0015.html#rt45]. In fact, the Jewish community excommunicated Spinozatwice for heresy, the first time while he was in his twenties.†45 [part0015.html#rt46]. Often spelled “Saadia.”*46 [part0015.html#rt47]. Or “spirit and form”—his commentary on Isa. 38:19.*47 [part0015.html#rt48]. Sometimes Guide for the Perplexed.*48 [part0016.html#rt49]. I have already noted how the versification of the textdiffers between Jewish and non-Jewish translations.*49 [part0017.html#rt50]. Where the “ch” sound is a guttural throat-clearing.*50 [part0017.html#rt51]. Plural of chozeh.*51 [part0017.html#rt52]. Pronounced ooreem and toomeem, with the accent on thesecond syllable of each word.*52 [part0019.html#rt53]. “Set” refers to the individual in whom the experienceis occurring. It includes the biology, psychology, state of mind, expectations,previous such experiences, and so on. “Setting” refers to the environment inwhich the experience takes place, such as indoors or outdoors, and recreationalor research, as well as the set of those in the immediate environment.*53 [part0019.html#rt54]. I call this category somaesthesia in our scientificpapers.†54 [part0019.html#rt55]. We also developed an Intensity category, which to alarge extent reflects to what degree changes occur within the other five. Italso assesses an overall, integrated impression of the strength of the drugeffect. I do not believe this category is as relevant to our purposes as it wasin the DMT work and will not include it in treating the prophetic state.*55 [part0019.html#rt56]. Note that I have not subjected the biblical data tothe same statistical analyses that we performed with the data from the DMTstudy. Such a project would be of great interest.*56 [part0019.html#rt57]. A goal we incidentally never find in the Hebrew Bible.*57 [part0020.html#rt58]. In DMT: The Spirit Molecule her name was Sarah, alsothe name of a biblical figure. In order to avoid confusion, I have changed hername here to Brenda.†58 [part0020.html#rt59]. The other is Enoch (Gen. 5:24).*59 [part0020.html#rt60]. The Hebrew Bible mentions “a Satan” or “the Satan” ina few rare instances: here and in 1 Chronicles, 1 Kings, and Zechariah. In eachcase, it refers to an accusing, adversarial, or enticing being.*60 [part0020.html#rt61]. “Jeremiah” in DMT: The Spirit Molecule.†61 [part0020.html#rt62]. All volunteers received a low dose of DMT before thehigh, fully psychedelic one. This was in order for them to learn about theexperimental setting and for us to be alert to any unusual sensitivity to thedrug, especially with respect to blood pressure elevation.*62 [part0020.html#rt63]. Any unreferenced DMT excerpts are from my researchnotes that did not get included in DMT: The Spirit Molecule.†63 [part0020.html#rt64]. A Hebrew word for a fiery angel whose three-letterHebrew root S-R-F means “to burn” or “to flame.” Seraphim is the plural ofseraph.‡64 [part0020.html#rt65]. For example, Ben (DMT, 198).*65 [part0020.html#rt66]. This is in contrast to the nausea, vomiting, anddiarrhea that may occur after ayahuasca consumption. These symptoms most likelyresult from the beta-carbolines in the brew rather than the DMT itself.*66 [part0021.html#rt67]. “Round things.”†67 [part0021.html#rt68]. More accurately “diviner.”‡68 [part0021.html#rt69]. Interestingly she saw Samuel but did not hear him,while Saul heard but did not see him. This may be an example of a less thanentirely successful “transfer” of prophecy from one to the other, a phenomenon Idiscussed in chapter 8, Prophet and Prophecy.*69 [part0021.html#rt70]. This is the first Hebrew word of the verse and means“Listen!”†70 [part0021.html#rt71]. Even here, the Hebrew word more accurately means“delighted in” or “desired” rather than “beloved.”*71 [part0021.html#rt72]. Leftover grapes on the vine after the harvest.*72 [part0022.html#rt73]. The Hebrew word kol (pronounced “coal”) could meaneither “voice” or “sound.”*73 [part0022.html#rt74]. Like Ofanim, but perhaps more spherical thanwheel-like.†74 [part0022.html#rt75]. Approximately three feet.‡75 [part0022.html#rt76]. Sometimes spelled Cherubim. It is the plural of cheruv(or cherub), an angelic figure.*76 [part0022.html#rt77]. Possibly a type of angelic being.†77 [part0022.html#rt78]. Eli in DMT: The Spirit Molecule.‡78 [part0022.html#rt79]. A deep, pure blue gemstone or the color of that stone.*79 [part0022.html#rt80]. “Aaron” in DMT: The Spirit Molecule.*80 [part0022.html#rt81]. A very large, treelike cactus of the Sonoran Desertpossessing mostly upright, cylindrical “arms.”*81 [part0022.html#rt82]. A name for God.*82 [part0022.html#rt83]. A “shining white” substance.*83 [part0022.html#rt84]. Gumby is a figure that first appeared in 1950schildren’s television. The show’s producers molded green clay over a wire,humanlike figure and bent it into various postures, using stop-motionphotography to give the impression of movement.*84 [part0023.html#rt85]. We checked the size of subjects’ pupils by using areference card held next to their briefly open eyes.†85 [part0023.html#rt86]. We inserted an intravenous line into each arm beforesessions began, one for administering the drug or placebo and one from which wedrew blood samples.*86 [part0024.html#rt87]. These issues may underlie both our findings and thoseof other research groups that the volitional category of the Hallucinogen RatingScale is generally less sensitive to various drug effects than are the othercategories.*87 [part0024.html#rt129] Ruach, whose “ch” is pronounced gutturally.*88 [part0024.html#rt88]. The Hebrew word for “face” and “faces” is the same.*89 [part0025.html#rt89]. For example Brenda, DMT: The Spirit Molecule, pages213–14.*90 [part0025.html#rt90]. As I will discuss later, the predominance of the“spoken voice” in biblical prophetic experience distinguishes it from the DMTstate. One solution to this apparent disparity is to consider most, if not all,the verbal exchanges the Hebrew Bible describes as taking place telepathically.*91 [part0025.html#rt91]. Hosts usually refers to the “heavenly hosts”; that is,the celestial bodies comprising the moon, planets, stars, constellations, andspheres.*92 [part0025.html#rt92]. Sarah’s original name.*93 [part0025.html#rt93]. Suffer the same fate, even though they don’t deserveit.†94 [part0025.html#rt94].

The rational principle developing and governing theuniverse.*98 [part0026.html#rt98]. Prayed for their welfare.*99 [part0027.html#rt99]. The Hebrew root is K-N-A, and the exact definition ofspecific K-N-A–related words depends upon context.*100 [part0027.html#rt100]. Usually “creating,” but “forming” lends moreaccuracy to the act.*101 [part0027.html#rt101]. By following God’s guidelines.*102 [part0027.html#rt102]. Ancient Native American ruins in New Mexico thatpossess spiritual significance for many contemporary spiritual seekers.*103 [part0027.html#rt103]. The French exegete Rashi proclaims in his commentsto these verses that the Golden Rule is “the Torah’s great principle.” TheSpaniard Nachmanides says in his commentary to the Golden Rule: “This is anexpression by way of an overstatement, for a human heart is not able to accept acommand to love one’s neighbor as oneself.” His solution follows ibn Ezra’sexegesis: that the rule means to love your fellow’s well-being as much as youlove your own well-being. Buber suggests that the Golden Rule tells us to act“as if” we love our fellow, which then may lead to actually establishing a moreloving relationship with that person.3 [part0038.html#fn67]*104 [part0028.html#rt104]. Literally, “circumcise your heart.”*105 [part0028.html#rt105]. That is, in the world of the living.*106 [part0028.html#rt106]. Most likely small clay idols.†107 [part0028.html#rt107]. Of a ritually slaughtered animal, in search ofanatomic patterns indicating the proper course of action.*108 [part0028.html#rt108]. A medical term referring to a sign or symptomuniquely characterizing a particular disease or condition.*109 [part0030.html#rt109]. Resulting in new insights or a deep intellectualrealization.†110 [part0030.html#rt110]. Denoting the inadequacy of words to characterize thestate.*111 [part0030.html#rt111]. Alternatively, “His spirits.”†112 [part0030.html#rt112]. These terms are interchangeable.‡113 [part0030.html#rt113]. The Active Intellect is the earth’s most proximateintermediary and thus exerts the most direct influence upon it.§114 [part0030.html#rt114]. I use imaginative faculty and imaginationinterchangeably.*115 [part0030.html#rt115]. I use the terms rational faculty, intellect, andintellectual faculty interchangeably.*116 [part0030.html#rt116]. This is most likely how he would have conceptualizedthe state of Zen enlightenment, when the field of the imagination becomes emptythrough the practice of meditation and the rational faculty alone is operativeat a high level.*117 [part0030.html#rt117]. Spinoza’s goal in writing his TractatusTheologico-Politicus,7 [part0038.html#fn84] in which he lays out his theories ofprophecy, was to wrest from the clerics of his day the authority to legislateand police proper thought, speech, and behavior. Spinoza realized that clericalpower, both that of the Church and that which he believed Maimonides’ writingsimplied, relied on the assumed divine nature of prophetic scripture. Bybelittling the vast majority of biblical prophecy and placing what he did findmeritorious in it, such as the Golden Rule, outside of philosophic andscientific discourse, Spinoza sought to undermine abusive clerical power thatrelied on prophetically inspired scripture as its justification.*118 [part0030.html#rt118]. In this model, God “knowing” the future doesn’tnecessarily affect it.*119 [part0030.html#rt119]. Ironically, this definition is consistent with whatSpinoza believes is the mechanism for nearly all of Hebrew biblical prophecy.Thus, his definition of a biblical prophet might be Maimonides’ definition of afalse prophet with virtue.*120 [part0031.html#rt120]. I discuss possible catalysts for raising endogenousDMT in DMT: The Spirit Molecule, especially pages 70–77. However, no data yetexist to confirm or refute the hypothesis that endogenous DMT levels rise inthese contexts.*121 [part0031.html#rt121]. The Hebrew word for light is ohr, whose three-letterroot is the basis for the word urim, one translation of which might be “lights”or “things that light up.”†122 [part0031.html#rt122]. While resurrection’s origin is supernatural—outsidethe realm of scientific scrutiny—the actual processes by which resurrectionmanifests within the natural world may be as amenable to explication as anyother observable phenomenon.*123 [part0031.html#rt123]. Maimonides does not believe animals have a share inthe world to come.3 [part0038.html#fn87] However, the ubiquity of DMT in theanimal kingdom points to the opposite notion.*124 [part0033.html#rt124]. The earliest part of the Talmud.*125 [part0033.html#rt125]. A Jewish military leader and historian who wroteduring the early first century CE. The occupying Romans destroyed the SecondTemple in 70 CE.*126 [part0034.html#rt126]. In Olaf Stapledon’s novel Last and First Men, theauthor chronicles two billion years of human evolution, beginning with thepresent day. One human species, simply a massively proportioned brain that theprevious race develops through genetic engineering, fails to survive not becauseof its lack of knowledge but due to its lack of empathy.*127 [part0034.html#rt127]. Josephus believes that only a true prophet iscapable of being an accurate historian. Thus, even the narratives andgenealogies in the Hebrew Bible reflect the activity of a prophetic mind.*128 [part0034.html#rt128].
