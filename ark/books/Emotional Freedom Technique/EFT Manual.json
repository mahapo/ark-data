Fortunately, that goal has been reached as EFT has dramatically reduced therapy time from months or years dow n to minutes or hours. Along the way, we kept notici ng that profound physical healings we re also taking place. Vision improved, headaches disappeared, cancer pains and symp toms subsided and so on. The reason for this, we found, is that EFT addresse s causes that Western Healing Pr actices have largely ignored. Medicine, for example, pays ve ry little attention to disruptions in t he body’s energy meridians nor does it give much weight to emotional causes. These causes, of course, are t he centerpiece of EFT. Thus it is no wonder that EFT pr oduces benefits where the medical pr ofession has thrown up its hands. The reason is simply because we are taking aim at causes that others have largely disregarded. This EFT Manual was written bef ore I realized the profound and wides pread nature of the physical healings. Accordingly, it stresses the emotional healings and doesn’t cover the physical healings in nearly as dramatic a fashion as they actually occu r. Because it has proven to be such an effective teaching manual, however, I have decided to leave it as is rather than modify it to emphasize physical healings. It is the emotional and energetic causes that we need to understand and those are profusely illustrated in these pages. As a reminder, though, I am sprinkling reference to t he physical healings througho ut this manual. Also, nothing contained herein is meant to replace qualified medical advice. Note to therapists, physicians, ministers and other members of the healing professions: This course represents a radical departure from conventional techniques. Properly used, it should multiply your abilities several fold. However, please know that it is aimed at professionals and lay people alike and so is written in a casual, easy to understand style. The author has taken great pains to bring this remarkable healing tool to the public in a practical way and has purposely avoided the somewhat stod gy, hard to understand image of an official text book. That notwithstanding, the accuracy and complet eness usually demanded by the professional has been maintained, even though it has been interwov en between metaphors and clip art. This is unconventional, of course, but so is Emotional Freedom Techniques. If you are looking for convention, you came to the wrong place."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" The Easy Way to Take This Course This section is important. It will save you a great deal of time and increase your efficiency with EFT. It is understandably human (I'm guilty of this t oo) for newcomers to glance at this manual to get a few highlights and then dive directly into those enticing vi deos. This, in the long run, will cost you because you are experiencing the course out of order. For example, it may seem to you that I am violating in the later videos what I preach in this manual. Not so. I am simply using effective shortcuts (they can cut the time involved by more than 50%) and am building on concepts developed in previous portions of th e course. Further, important terms such as \"aspects\", \"psyc hological reversal\" and \"ene rgy toxins\" cannot be prope rly understood without the requisite background. All of this is develope d and unfolded in an easy to understand manner if you take the course in the proper order. I spent two years and a boat full of money putting EFT together and did so in a way that makes it easy to learn. So ... let me make the strong suggestion that the EFT course be taken in the order it is presented . That’s the easy way. Doing it out of order is the hard way. It is like reading a book by firs t viewing chapter 1, then chapter 8, then chapter 4 and then ignori ng the rest of the chapters fi guring you know the rest anyway. Enough said. The Easy Way to Take the EFT Course Part I - The Basics 1. First, read the PART I section in the manual, going through the sections in order. This is important even if you are an experienced therapist beca use the later portions of the course build on the ideas and terminology contained in these pages. The main chapter in Part I is en titled \"The Basic Recipe.\" It covers in detail EFT's fundame ntal healing routine and is the pad from which everything else in EFT is launched. As you will learn in Part II, however, you rarely need to do the entire Basic Recipe . Various shortcuts almost always suffice. Nonetheless, you need to know the full Basic Recipe as a foundation so that you can best us e the shortcuts and master the art of EFT. When you finish reading Part I, don’t go direct ly to Part II. That comes later. Important Note to those downloading this manual free from the internet: This Manual refers to videos and audios (below) that are in cluded in the much more compr ehensive EFT Course. The entire EFT Course, including the videos and audios, is available at https://www.emofree.com/eftstore However, this manual provides all the basics. The videos and audios are not unnecessary unless you want to expand your skills beyond beginner status. Also: If you haven’t already done so, please subscribe to our free EFT Insights Newsletter at http://www.emofree. com/subscribe.asp 2. Next, study the Part I videos. There are three of them and they are recognizable by the blue print on their labels. Video 1a augments Part I of this manual and show s you each of the tapping points a nd all the routines involved in The Basic Recipe. Video 1b contains a session that uses the full Basic Recipe to address, and resolves an intense fear of water for a ma n named Dave. Please note that this is the only time in the entire EFT course that the full Basic Recipe is used. This is done solely in the interest of giving you a complete look at the foundational routine. All the rest of the sessions in this course use the shortcuts. Dave's fear of water is a complicated case in"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" that there are several aspects to deal with before the problem disappears. Th is makes it ideal for your education. Even though the entire session takes only one hour (inc luding an extensive interview before the EFT process begins) it is, by EFT standards, tedious. By using the shor tcuts, the case could have been completed in a fraction of the time. Videos 2a, 2b and 3 further your education by le tting you look in on a works hop and numerous individual sessions. Here you see more of the power of EFT as you watch the shortcut versions of The Basic Recipe in action on a wide ranging array of problem s. The, shortcuts are not yet explai ned, however. That comes in Part II. 3. Next, review pages 43 through 45 in this manua l (about the audio recordings on DVD) and then study these audios for more case histories, and comment s. The purpose of these recordings is not to teach you how to do The Basic Recipe. That is done elsewhere in the course. Rather, the purposes ar e: (1) to give you more experience with the wide variety of the issues which EFT addresses, (2) to give you a sense for th e role that \"aspects\" often play in this process and (3) to a llow you to experience the varying respons es people give to these procedures (anywhere from enthusiasm to cautious disbelief). Part II - Advanced 1. First, read the Pa rt II section in the manual, going through the se ctions in order. He re you will be introduced to the Impediments to Perfection (inc luding Energy Toxins), Shortcuts and ot her helpful tips for getting the most out of EFT. 2. Then study the Part II videos. There are 8 of them and th ey are recognizable by the red print on their labels. Video #I of Part II serves as a bridge between Part I and Part 11 and is impor tant to watch. The rest of the Part II videos reveal live sessions and discussi ons that display the art of EFT. Thes e are real sessions just like the ones you face with yourself or clients and are a treasure chest filled with examples of EFT in action. They profusely display the art of EFT and should be studied several times to get the most out of them.

Part I The basics of EFT and a step by step procedure for putting it into action.

There's a light rain outside making gentle noises on the window. After two years of writing and filming, EFT is complete. We are almost ready to \"go to press.\" And five minutes ago the tears came rolling down my face. And then I knew why I authored this course. What I mean is, I always knew why...but I didn't know how to say it. And now I can put it in words. Here's the story. Five minutes ago I was reviewing a video that my associate, Adrienne Fowlie, and I made at the Veterans Administration in Los Angeles. We spent 6 days there using EFT to help our Vietnam vets get beyond the horrible memories of war. You will see that DVD as part of this course. They had Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) which is among the most severe forms of emotional disorders known. Every day these men relive the catastrophes of war....like being forced to shoot innocent civilians (including young children)....burying people in open trenches....and watching their own dear friends die or become dismembered. The sounds of gunfire, bombs and screams ricochet in their heads day and night. Sometimes only drugs ease the ever present aches of war. They sweat. They cry. They have headaches and anxiety attacks. They are depressed and in pain. They have fears a nd phobias and are afraid to go to sleep at night because of their nightmares. Many have been in therapy for 20 years....with very little relief. I still remember how thrilled I was when the VA invited Adrienne and me to bring EFT to our soldiers. They gave us free rein to counsel with these men in any way we wanted. This would be the ultimate test regarding the power of EFT. If all it did was make a modest, but noticeable, difference in the lives of these severely disabled men, most people would have considered it successful. In fact, it did much more. The VA didn't pay us. They didn't have a budget for outside help like this. In fact, we had to pay for our own air fares, hotel bills, meals and car rentals. But we didn't care. We would have paid much more just for the opportunity. So anyway, this video I was watching was a summary of what happened during those 6 days. One section was all about Rich, who had been in therapy for 17 years for his PTSD. He had: **Over 100 haunting war memories, many of which he relived daily. **A major height phobia....aggravated by having made over 50 parachute jumps. **Insomnia....it took him 3 or 4 hours to get to sleep every night -- even under quite strong medication. After using EFT with him, every trace of those problems vanished. Like most people, Rich had a hard time believing that these rather strange appearing procedures would work. But he was willing to give them a try. We started with his height phobia and after about 15 minutes with EFT, it was gone. He tested it by going several stories up in a building and looking down over a fire escape. To his amazement, he had no phobic reaction whatsoever. We then applied EFT to several of his most intense war memories and neutralized all of them within an hour. He still remembers them, of course, but they no longer have any emotional charge. We taught the techniques to Rich (just as you are being taught through this course) so he could, by himself, work on the rest of his war memories. Within a few days they were all neutralized. They no longer bothered him. As a result, the insomnia went away and so did the insomnia medication (with the supervision of his physician). Two months later I spoke with Rich on the phone. He was still free of the problems. That's real emotional freedom. It's the end of years of torment. It's like walking out of a prison. And.... I had the privilege of handing him the keys!!! Man....what a feeling. This is the promise of EFT. Master it and you can do for yourself, and others, what happened for Rich. Then there was Robert, Gary, Phillip and Ralph who all had traumatic war memories. In minutes, EFT"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 2 provided relief for the memories we worked on. To see the smiles and hear the gratitude was a form of joy that only tears can express. And then came the video interview with Anthony. Anthony was so frightened by his war experiences that he was afraid to go into a public place....like a restaurant....for fear a Vietnamese soldier would come in firing an AK47. He would freeze up at the mere thought of it. He knew, of course, it wasn't logical but that didn't make the fear any better. That's what PTSD is like. After using EFT, Anthony went with us to a crowded restaurant and, in his words, he \"didn't have a nickel's worth of anxiety.\" The three of us, Adrienne, Anthony and myself, casually laughed and joked while we had a leisurely dinner in this restaurant, crowded with over 200 people. Anthony was completely relaxed. The fear was gone. What movement! What a feeling to be able to make such a difference in someone's life. Then, in the interview on camera, he paused a minute and said, \"God has blessed me, I swear. I think it was my time to meet you guys.\" And there...sitting in my living room...is when those happy tears went rolling down my face. The human value in this course deserves its own mountain top. You can lift yourself to new levels with it. And, if you wish, you can use it to help others and magnify your self worth in the process. How many thank you's would you like? No greater reward could I give you. So now I hope you know my motivation for writing this course. It is because God has blessed me, I swear. It is my time to meet you! Together we will build within you a bridge to the land of personal peace. Once built, this bridge will become a lifetime skill that you can use to spread emotional freedom...and joy....from yourself to others. And....it's permanent. Like gold... it doesn't rust or tarnish or become obsolete. It will always be there for you. You and I may never meet face to face so I may not be able to see you and know your warmth, as I did with Anthony. Our only connection may be limited to this course. But that's OK. Wh enever people join for the purpose of healing, they are doing God's work. Love fills the space in between (however large) and helps it happen. God does not require that we meet face to face. You and I are about to travel together on a journey toward emotional freedom. It will be like nothing you have experienced before....I promise. It is not a mythical ride on a magic carpet that ends in illusion. It is a real ride destined to give you real results....just like it did for our veterans. You will, indeed, develop the ability to discard your fears, phobias, traumatic memories, anger, guilt, grief and all other limiting emotions. And it won't take years and years of painstakingly slow and financially draining sessions either. Often, even the most severe negative emotions vanish in minutes. But I'm getting ahead of myself. You will see all the proof you need as you learn this course and apply these techniques to yourself. You will also learn of their limitations. EFT doesn't do everything for everyone. But what it does do will astonish you. It still astonishes me and I've been doing it for years. EFT, by the way, does far more than what is covered in this letter. I've just opened the lid a little here and let you peek in. The rest of it will unfold as you turn these pages.  My Best Regards, Gary H. Craig P.S. As a reminder, please recall from our opening comments that the emotional and energetic releases brought about by EFT frequently result in profound physical healings. "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 3 A Priceless Gift A special dedication...a than k you...for those pioneers whose efforts have he lped launch EFT. “We are on the ground floor of a Healing High Rise” You and I have been given a priceless gift. Unfortunately, we will never meet some of our benefactors because their essential contributions were made over 5,000 years ago. These brilliant people discovered, and mapped, the centerpiece of EFT, namely, the subtle energies that course throughout the body. These subtle energies are also the centerpiece of acupuncture and, as a result, EFT and acupuncture are cousins. Both disciplines are growing rapidly and, as time unfolds, they are destined to have a primary role in both emotional and physical healing. In more recent times, some other dedicated souls have advanced our use of these anci ent techniques. Principal among them is Dr. George Goodheart and his many fine contributions to the field of Applied Kinesiology, a forerunner to EFT. Dr. John Diamond’s work gets exceptional applause because, to my knowledge, he was one of the first psychiatrists to use, and write about, these subtle energies. His many pioneering concepts, together with the advanced ideas from Applied Kinesiology, has formed the foundation upon which this new Healing High Rise is being constructed. Dr. Roger Callahan, from whom I received my original introduction to these procedures, deserves all the credit history can give him. He was first to bring these techniques to the public in a substantial way and did so despite open hostility from his own profession. As you might appreciate, it takes heavy doses of conviction to plow through the ingraine d beliefs of conventional thinking. Without Roger Callahan’s missionary drive, we might still be sitting around theorizing about this “interesting thing.” It is upon the shoulders of these giants that I humbly stand. My own contribution to this rapidly expanding field has been to reduce the unnecessary complexity that inevitably finds its way into new discoveries. EFT is an elegantly simple version of these procedures that professionals and laypersons alike can use on a wide variety of problems. We are on the ground floor of a Healing High Rise and thus we have much to learn. Accordingly, I am indebted to the many EFT practitioners that have tirelessly contributed their innovations to our web site ( www.emofree.com ). They are taking us to new levels.

I went for various personal reasons but I didn't go to have my fear of heights resolved. It didn't even occur to me I could get rid of that fear until Gary asked if there was anyone in the room who was afraid of heights. I raised my hand and instantly got nervous, started to sweat and shake. I had a horrible fear of heights and couldn't even stand on a chair comfortably. Well, an amazing thing happened. He helped me through the EFT procedure and my fear dissolved almost instantly. So quick in fact I am still having a hard time believing it. As you know, you and I went upstairs to look out a window and it didn't even phase me. The next day at work I looked over a second story balcony and that didn't bother me. Even more amazing is the fact that I have only been on a Ferris Wheel maybe 3 times in my whole life and I went to the Sonoma County Fair yesterday and rode on one and wasn't even scared!!! That was the real test! The other times I was on one I was petrified. I couldn't breathe. I would hyperventilate, sweat, shake, it was unreal how I felt. Yesterday, I was totally relaxed and comfortable. It was truly a miracle. My kids were shocked! They know how real my fear used to be and now it's like it was never there. By the way, I've only had to do the EFT procedures one other time since the time Gary helped me and it was a few days before I went to the fair. I didn't even do it the day of the fair!

COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE I N C O R P O R A T E D Mr. Gary Craig c/o Adrienne Fowlie Emotional Freedom Techniques™ 1102 Redwood Boulevard Novato, CA 94947 Dear Gary, I was one of the people who attended the Los Angeles seminar you hosted for the National Veterans Foundatio n last month where you demonstrated EFT to us. The statement \"all negative emotions are ca used by an imbalance in the body's energy system\" is a bold statement. The notion that tapping the body to produce rapid changes in these emotions really asked a little more of my belief system than I could give without proof. To say that phobias could be cured almost immediately or positive results could be achieved in sports, business and addictions by using EFT was somewhat difficult to believe to say the least. After witnessing the extraordinary results you achieved with the people you worked with in your seminar I used EFT to attempt to improve my golf score. To my amazement and delight the immediate result, after three applications of the technique, was to lower my golf score by ten (10) strokes from mid nineties to mid or low eighties. I am now, and have been since using your technique, staying consistently in the low eighties on most courses. I am now looking forward to similar results in the next application of your technique which I choose for myself. Thank you for this interesting fun tool.  Best Regards, Gray DeFevere  Gray DeFevere 1554 South Sepulveda Boulevard Los Angeles, CA 90025"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 8 The Legal Stuff Important...please read carefully Common sense would suggest that you wouldn't expect much in the way of negative side effects from EFT. This is because there are: No surgical procedures. No needles. No pills or chemicals. No pushing or pulling on the body. Instead, there are just a few seemingly harmless procedures that involve tapping, humming, counting and rolling your eyes around in your head. By now over 100,000 people have u sed EFT and the number of complaints are well under 1%. Once in awhile someone might report feeling a little nauseous and, on occasion, a few people report “feeling worse.” Because these reports are so infrequent it is unknown whether or not EFT actually caused the problem. Some people, by the way, feel nauseous or “get worse” at the mere mention of their particular problem. They will do so whether or not EFT is introduced. EFT is still in its beginni ng stages and we have much to learn. Thus it is possible that using EFT could be deleterious to someone. Accordingly, you should assume that we are still in the experimental stage and use EFT with appropriate caution. Along these line I include below an important message that I provided for the EFT email support list. It should be read carefully. Don't go where you don't belong Hi Everyone, This is an important message and I have spent many hours writing and rewriting it to \"get it right\". Fortunately, what I have to say here is obvious common sense and 99% of you already understand what I have to say. The bottom line here is that we need to use common sense with EFT and NOT apply it to people with serious issues UNLESS we have the appropriate experience to do so. While our fascination with these procedures gives us much cause for enthusiasm, we must weigh that enthusiasm against some common sense caveats. Let me explore both sides of this issue. First, one of the delightful aspects of EFT (and its many cousins) is that, for the vast majority of people, it can be applied with little or no pain. Its gentle nature has prompted numerous psychologists to write books on the topic so that the lay pu blic will have access to these procedures. And why not? Why deny the public access to tools that are so often transformative on so many issues...and...for most people is gentle and easy to apply? Consider, for example, that.... Therapists are routinely teaching the process to their clients for use at home. Teachers are learning it for use with their students. Coaches are learning it for use with their athletes. Parents are learning it for use with their children. Physicians are learning it for pain management with their patients. Massage practitioners are blending it with their existing procedures for longer and more lasting results. Spiritual leaders are applying it to those in need. Chiropractors, acupuncturists and homeopathy practitioners are augmenting their practices and teaching it to patients for self use. And so on it goes... I don't know for sure how many tapping enthusiasts are now using these procedures in behalf of others but I would estimate that it exceeds 100,000 and it has probably been applied over 1 million times worldwide. This wouldn't happen, of course, unless (1) substantial results were being received and (2) perceived dangers, or negative side effects, were minimal. While no experienced EFT'er can deny seeing substantial results, not everyone is aware that, infrequently, there CAN BE negative side effects-- sometimes severe. Let me explain. Some people have been so badly traumatized and/or abused in their lifetimes that they have developed severe psychological problems.... such as multiple personalities, paranoia, schizophrenia and other serious mental disorders. While EFT has been helpful even in such severe cases, IN THESE INSTANCES IT SHOULD ONLY BE APPLIED BY A QUALIFIED PROFESSIONAL WITH EXPERIENCE IN THESE DISORDERS. Why? Because some of these patients experience \"abreactions\" whereby they go out of control. During abreactions they can be harmful to themselves and others and may need to be sedated or hospitalized. This, obviously, is no place for the novice....no matter"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 9 how enthusiastic one might be with the tapping procedures. Incidentally, we don't know yet whether tapping actually causes such abreactions or if it is just the memory of one's troublesome issues that precipitates such problems. Nonetheless, if you have no experience in these areas, please don't go where you don't belong. How often do these abreactions happen? In a psychiatric hospital they are common. In everyday society they are rare. I recently called several proficient tappers that have dealt with a wide variety of emotional problems and learned that less than 1 in 1,000 clients had experienced such a severe abreaction. This minimal percentage is given for perspective only It is not to suggest that EFT'ers should \"play the odds\" and \"go where they don't belong\". On the contrary, a novice EFT'er should use common sense and NOT TRY TO ALLEVIATE AILMENTS THAT ARE BEYOND THEIR CAPACITY OR TRAINING. I am well known for the phrase \"Try it on everything!\" This phrase appears in the EFT manual, The EFT Course and on our web site. Its purpose, of course, is to open up our mi nds to EFT's possibilities. It is not meant as a license for irresponsible actions. Fortunately, people interpret this within a reasonable context and do not, for example, use EFT to get someone to fly off the Empire State Building. On some occasions, people undergoing EFT have normal tears or other forms of distress that accompany the recalling of their troublesome memories. On other occasions some physical pains \"get worse\"--at least temporarily. The proficient and experienced professional will greet these responses as norma l and appropriately apply EFT for their resolution Again, when these responses occur, common se nse must prevail. If the EFT'er is in over their head, they should refer the client to someone with more experience.

Onward."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" 10 What to Expect From This Course Emotional Freedom -- Simplicity -- Healthy Skepticism Case Histories -- Repetition Emotional Freedom Perhaps I should be a bit more humble about it, but I think EFT will dramatically change your world. I know it seems like a bit of a stretch at this point but these techniques may compete in importance with the Declaration of Independence. For some, they are the Declaration of Independence. By independence I mean freedom from negati ve emotions. That is, freedom that allows you to blossom and rise above whatever hidden hurdles keep you from performing to your capacity. I mean freedom from years of self doubt...or call reluctance...or grief over the loss of a loved one...or anger...or negative memories involving rape or other forms of abuse. I mean freedom to earn that greater income, make those business calls, start that new business, improve your golf score, lose that weight, approach people with ease or become a public speaker, singer or comedian. I mean freedom from the anxiety that causes you to take those pills, drink that alcohol, smoke those cigarettes or raid that refrigerator. I mean freedom to express love easily and walk upon this planet with grace and confidence. I mean freedom from intense fears...or phobias...or anxiety...or panic attacks...or post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)...or addictive cravings...or depression...or guilt ...or...or...or... Like I said, I think EFT will dramatically change your world. **There is no long, drawn out, \"tell me your life story\" feature to EFT. **There are no pills. **There is no painfully reliving past traumatic events. **It doesn't take months or years. **It takes a fraction of the usual time and is often done in minutes. People simply get beyond their emotional luggage, usually permanently, and go about their lives more effectively. EFT is based on the discovery that imbalances in the body's energy system have profound effects on one's personal psychology. Co rrecting these imbalances, which is done by tapping on certain body locations, often leads to rapid remedies. By rapid, I mean, most of the problems vanish in minutes!!! ( This is especially so when you reduce the problems to specific negative events in your life. More on this later.) This is demonstrated repeatedly in the case histories and live sessions that are included with this course. A few problems take longer....m aybe two or three brief sessions. The most difficult ones tend to require anywhere from a few days to several weeks. Fortunately, these are in the minority. Simplicity This course does not purport to teach you every intricacy regarding these discoveries. That would take hundreds of pages and require you to delve into such highly technical areas as quantum physics and morphogenetic fields. We cut through all of that here and provide a simple, highly workable version for the everyday citizen. Taking this course is like learning to drive a car. You don't have to know all the physics, chemistry, engineering and mathematics of an automobile in order to learn how to drive it. But you do need to know about the gas pedal, the brake, the steering wheel and the gear shift lever. With those basics you can drive on most roads with ease. My purpose here is to reduce a very complex subject to a few simple, easy to understand procedures (gas pedal, brake, etc.). The shorter, and more concise I can make them, the easier they will be to learn and use. And an easy to use, powerful procedure for enhancing your personal performance is what you paid for. Accordingly, this course is peppered with easy to grasp examples, pictures and metaphors so that every piece of the EFT process will be clear and obvious. "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 11 Healthy Skepticism A new innovation usually meets with skepticism because it violates people's beliefs. And EFT flies in the face of just about every belief there is about psychology and emotional healing. Rapid remedies for \"difficult\" emotional problems are, in some circles, considered impossible and anyone who purports to do them rapidly is labeled a charlatan. \" After all \", the belief goes, \" these things are deeply ingrained in people and therefore they must take a long time to remedy. \" Beliefs are very powerful. We fight wars over them. We build monuments to them. Medicine, psychology and political systems are built on them. But, alas, sometimes they aren't true. We just think they are. Sometimes we believe in fairy tales. If your reaction to the promises made in the preceding pages includes an \"it's too good to be true\" attitude...or anything like that...then I have probably already violated your beliefs. This is healthy and to be expected. New ideas should be subject to rigorous scrutiny. It lends them strength in the long run. You hold in your hand a major innovation. As you will see, it is based on the soundest of scientific principles. But because it is so dramatically different from \"conventional wisdom,\" it is consistently, and understandably, greeted with skepticism. EFT is not alone in this. Other innovati ons have met with similar attitudes. Here are a few quotes from history: \"Heavier-than-air flying machines are impossible.\" Lord Kelvin, President Royal Society \"Everything that can be invented has been invented.\" Charles H. Duell, Director of U.S. Patent Office, 1899 \"Sensible and responsible women do not want to vote.\" Grover Cleveland, 1905 \"There is no likelihood man can ever tap the power of the atom.\" Robert Milikan, Nobel Laureate in Physics, 1923 \"Who the heck wants to hear actors talk?\" Harry M. Warner, Warner Brothers Pictures, 1927 But even if you have no skepticism whatsoever and soak this up quickly and enthusiastically...like I did...I guarantee that you will run into major skepticism from others that you try to help with it. How do I know this? Years of experience. This skepticism is not to be criticized, however. But it does need to be understood because there are some unique features to it regarding EFT. Here's an example. On many occasions I have demonstrated these techniques (to newcomers) from the stage with 5 or 10 volunteers from the audience. Within a few minutes at least 80% of them have obvious major reductions...or outright eliminations...of physical and emotional problems. Fears subside, headaches go away, breathing clears up and emotional trauma disappears. I then ask the audience, \" Who here is skeptical about this? \" and, invariably, at least half of the hands go up. I then ask them if they think the changes these people made were real and...yes...they always agree that the changes were real. After all, the people who made the changes are usually strangers to me and friends of the audience. They know the people are reporting honestly. \" So why are you skeptical?\", I ask. And then I get a barrage of reasons as to why it worked.... **I am told that I hypnotized the people . This is interesting because I don't know the first thing about hypnosis...and neither do the people who offer the reason. **I am told that it is just positive thinking. Even though they have never before seen positive thinking make these kinds of changes this fast . **I am told that the people just wanted to get over their problems. It was simply a case of \"mind over matter.\" Then why didn't they get over the problems before they came on stage? **I am told that it won't last because there is no such thing as a \"quick fix.\" Yet they take drugs like penicillin to \"quick fix\" other ailments. **I am told that the tapping techniques were distractions that took people's minds off their problems. This ignores the requirement that people \"tune in\" to their problem for EFT to work. It is the exact opposite of distraction. Now here's what's really fascinating about this phenomenon.... none of the reasons given include EFT. EFT is somehow excluded from the list of possibilities!! What an odd reaction. You would think people, after seeing these unmistakable benefits, would bombard me with questions as to how the techniques worked so they could better understand the process. Instead, they tend to ignore the process and offer other explanations . They don't ask me what happened. They tell me instead. They each reach into their own bag of knowledge and experience and link what just happened to what No Trespassing Behind this wall are my existing beliefs"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 12 they already \"know\" to be true. EFT isn't in that bag (yet) and so they have difficulty making the link. Now I know how our scientists of several centuries ago felt when they tried to tell flat earth believers that the world was round. Hardly ever, does anyone say to me, \" Oh...it's like you said. You balanced their energy system while they were tuned in to the problem and thereby eliminated the cause.\" Yet that is what happened. And it is exactly what I spent the previous half hour telling the audience would happen. It is the only thing that happened during the few minutes these people were on stage and it is the only thing that brought about the changes. I used to be critical about this and thought people were being belligerent, stubborn or stupid. \" Why can't they see the obvious? \", I would say to myself. But then I realized that people weren't being belligerent, stubborn or stupid because this reaction came from people from all walks of life. It didn't matter whether they were bus drivers or PhD's. Some of my closest friends would simply \"explain away\" these stunning results and snicker a bit at the \"silliness\" of the process. Often even the people making the changes will credit something else for creating the change. And it's usually something totally unrelated like a recent earthquake or a raise in pay they just received. Mind you, they don't deny the change occurred or that it happened while doing EFT . They just aren't able to link it with the tapping techniques. To them it doesn't compute. It doesn't make sense. There must be some other explanation. Dr. R oger Callahan, from whom I received my initial introduction to these procedures calls this the APEX problem. Again, it is not to be criticized. But it is important to observe and understand because it does happen with great frequency. In fact, most people experience it and, there is a high likelihood you are among them. That's why I am telling you this. If you are not aware of it you may \"explain it away\" and turn your back on your ticket to emotional freedom and all the lifetime benefits it offers. Another reason for skepticism is that EFT looks weird. I mean really, really weird . These techniques will have you talking to yourself, rolling your eyes around in your head and humming a song while tapping on various parts of your body. They don't even remotely resemble psychology as most people know it and may be waaaay outside your belief system. However once you understand the logic behind them, these techniques become obvious. And you may wonder why they weren't discovered earlier. That being said, here's an interesting aside. You do not have to believe in these t echniques for them to work. Some people mistakenly concl ude that EFT gets results simply because people believe in it. That is a particularly strange conc lusion because it is usually made by those who are skeptical. The fact is, people rarely believe in these techniques at first. They are almost always skeptical...at least to a degree. Despite the usual lack of belief by newcomers the results obtained by EFT occur undiminished. People make their improvements in spite of their skepticism. Case Histories As a child I was quite taken by the game of baseball and I used to dream about playing center field for the New York Yankees. Batting looked so easy to do. Just stand up there at the plate and hit the ball when it is thrown to you. Hitting baseballs, of course, is a skill and it takes experience to become proficient at it. The more fast balls, curves and sliders you see the better you become. The same is true with EFT. Memorizing the mechanics of EFT is easy. Applying it is almost as easy and you can become proficient with the mechanics after just a handful of tries. However, if you wish to master it you will need to diligently study the DVDs in the EFT Course (and our other DVD sets) and use it on a wide variety of problems (fast balls, curves and sliders) to perfect your skill. In short, you will need more training and experience than what you are receiving with just this manual. Perhaps the biggest limit you will encounter in using EFT is not recognizing how much you can do with it. That is one of the reasons I am swamping you with case histories in this course. You will find them written up in this manual. More importantly, there are hours of them on the videos and more hours of them on the audios. These DVD sessions are critical to your mastery of these techniques because they bring EFT “off the written page” and display their effectiveness in real life. Please study them in detail. They are actual cases...done with real people and real problems...so you can broaden your horizons. You will witness some people getting over lifelong problems in moments while others require persistence. You will hear EFT applied to some severe emotional problems and hear them melt away right on the audio. You will also witness some partial relief that doesn't go away completely. In short, these audios give you a rainbow of actual experience, a necessary background if you wish to graduate from mechanical EFT to mastery. Another reason I am immersing you in so many case histories is that I want to expose you to so many people"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" 13 with dramatic changes from using EFT that you can't possibly be skeptical. Even the most entrenched sk eptic will not be able to withstand this barrage of obvious evidence. EFT is everything I say it is....and more. Repetition I am a great believer in repetition. It is the most time honored teaching tool on the planet and I use it relentlessly. The more you are exposed to something the better you learn it. That's why you will hear me come at these ideas from many different angles in this course. I visit the same concepts repeatedly in this manual, the videos and the audios. If you grow weary of hearing an idea repeatedly...be thankful. That means you have learned it so well that it now bores you a bit. That is far better than being exposed to an idea only once and not have it take root in your memory. Because of the major importance of these techniques to the quality of your life, I do you a shameful disservice if I don't drum these crucial ideas home. So...I repeat. Expect repetition in this course. P.S. As a reminder, please recall from our opening comments that the emotional and energetic releases brought about by EFT frequently result in profound physical healings. "},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" 14 The Science Behind EFT An engineer looks at the science of psychology -- The body's energy system Dr. Callahan's first experience The Discovery Statement -- The 100% overhaul concept An engineer looks at the science of psychology This course is written by a Stanford engineer. I'm not a psychologist with a long list of initials behind my name. People call me Gary and not Dr. so and so. If you are a conventional thinker, that might bother you. After all, what business does an engineer have intruding into the field of psychology? The physical sciences and the mind sciences appear to have nothing in common. True. But 40 years ago I realized that the quality of one's life was directly related to their emotional health. Emotional health is the foundation beneath self confidence and self confidence is the springboard to achievement in every walk of life. This is not a new idea, of course. Virtually everyone agrees with it and the self help section in every major bookstore is burgeoning with books on the subject. Most people take this idea for granted and read a book or attend a seminar on it now and then. But I took it seriously...very seriously. As long as I'm going to spend a few decades on this planet I might as well make it a joyous experience for myself and others. So I went on a 40 year search to find tools that would help people in this regard. I read all those books (by the hundreds) and spent thousands of dollars on seminars and tapes. I chased down every lead I could find with the enthusiasm of a newspaper reporter on the hunt for that \"big story.\" I talked to psychiatrists and psychologists and psychotherapists of every kind to find what worked. And EFT, by far, is the most fascinating, most rewarding, most effective tool I have ever found for personal improvement. It lives up to its name and does, indeed, provide freedom from negative emotions. But I'm getting ahead of myself. I want to trace through some of the milestones of my search because they form an important base on which to build your introduction to this ingenious discovery. First, please understand that I have never formally used my training as an engineer. I have always chosen people oriented professions and have, at the same time, always pursued my true passion as a Personal Performance Coach. But that doesn't mean I wasn't influenced by my scientific training. Indeed, that training led me to many useful personal performance tools. You see, engineering is an exact science. It is very practical. Two plus two must equal four. There is a reason for everything. Logic tends to rule in the thinking of an engineer. So, when I set out to find personal improvement tools I took that mindset with me. To me a tool had to make sense...it had to be practical...it had to be scientific. In short... if it didn't work in the real world I wasn't interested. So I began reading those books and attending seminars on psychology. It was the \"logical\" thing to do. But psychology was a puzzle to me. I was looking for the same logic and precision that I was used to as an engineer but it didn't seem to be there. After many years of probing the institution known as psychology I can assure you that the science of engineering and the science of psychology bear little relationship to each other. On the surface, psychology seems to be very scientific. There are laboratories in nearly every major university in America dedicated to research on psychological issues. Theories are put forward and rigorously tested. \"Controlled\" studies are done to assure the findings are valid. These studies then form the basis of carloads of professional papers written by the most highly esteemed practitioners in the field. It all seems very impressive and, in many ways, it is. All this research does uncover many valuable aspects to our thinking process and our behaviors. They are used effectively in sales and advertising and many other fields. But the vast majority of them do very little to give people rapid, long lasting relief from their emotional problems. I know that sounds a little irreverent and I mean no one disrespect. But by an engineer's standards...that is a very true statement. There are some exceptions, of course, but the vast majority of the conventional techniques have poor track records."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" 15 Please understand, this is not a criticism of psychotherapists. I find the members of that profession to be among the most dedicated people on earth and I count many of them as my personal friends. They are very caring individuals who have great concerns for their patients. They work long hours and are constantly seeking new ways to improve on the tools they have been given to work with. EFT is a new tool for their \"people helping toolbox\" that contains a distinctly scientific component. That scientific component would satisfy even the most demanding engineer. It has to improve any therapist's performance. Some people undergo therapy for months or years for relief from their fears, anger, guilt, grief, depression, traumatic memories, etc. and make little or no headway. So they switch therapists in hopes someone else has \"the answer.\" The results are often the same. They switch again...and again...and again. They spend money. They spend time. They go through emotionally painful sessions. But if anyt hing positive happens for most of these people, it doesn't appear to be much. I found this rather curious. To me there was something obviously wrong with the methods used because (1) they weren't working (at least by my standards) and (2) they were painfully slow. So I asked therapists and patients, \" Why does it take so long to do so little? \" The answers varied, of course, but generally speaking they went something like this.... **\" Well, the problem is deeply ingrained \" or **\" It is a deep scar \" or **\" We don't know for sure...we are dealing with the mysteries of the mind, you know. \" My engineering mind tossed these answers out immediately as convenient ways to explain away, or rationalize, methods that just didn't do much. But to most people they sounded good. They sounded reasonable. So they were accepted and pursued. Besides, what else could be done? Real answers weren't available. Also, I don't mean to imply here that no one gets any help or relief from therapy. That just isn't so. Some do. But in general it is among the slowest, most ineffective sciences on earth. To this engineer the only scientific laboratory that counts is the real world and there is only one criteria for whether or not a given psychological theory is valid. Namely.... does it work for the client? If an engineer designs a computer, for example, it had better work in the real world and work perfectly. Otherwise, consumers will return it promptly for a refund and may send a nasty letter to boot. In emotional health, however, if a new method seems to work once in a while (and as long as it is not too radical) it is often heralded as a breakthrough and the discoverer of the method gets rich by writing books and giving lectures. Interesting...but that's the way it is. In the early years of my search for personal improvement tools I considered getting degrees in psychology. But the more I was exposed to that field the more I concluded that to do so would work to my disadvantage. Why? Because I would have to learn about methods that didn't work...at least by my standards. I just couldn't see the merits in going through all that schooling to learn something that, to me, was of questionable value. It would, paradoxically, distract me from my true goal of finding personal improvement tools that work. As the years went by I discovered a list of helpful tools that I used for myself and taught to others. None of them, incidentally, came from psychology text books. They were all well received and effective when properly applied. One of the tools that I thought was quite helpful was Neuro Linguistic Programming (also known as NLP). I dove into that head first and became quite proficient at it. I became certified as a Master Practitioner and helped a lot of people with it. I recommend anyone study it who is interested in personal improvement. Then my search for reliable personal improvement tools took a mega jump to a new level. I was told about a psychologist in Southern California, Dr. Roger Callahan, who was giving people relief from intense fears (phobias) in minutes. So , ever the eager beaver, I called him immediately to inquire of his methods. He told me that his methods weren't limited to just phobias. They applied to all negative emotions. That included depression, guilt, anger, grief, post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and any other negative emotion I could name. Furthermore, the method usually only took minutes to perform and the result was usually permanent. On the one hand I was enthusiastic about his claims. But I must also admit to a fair amount of skepticism as well. The statement sounded a bit grandiose...even to me. But I was still listening. Then he told me the method consisted of tapping with the fingertips at the end points of the body's energy meridians. \" You mean meridians like in acupuncture? \", I said. \" Exactly, \" he replied. \" Hmmm”, I thought, “That’s a little far out.” Here was a PhD making some startling claims and trying to explain them in terms of the subtle amounts of electricity that circulate throughout the body. Psychology and electricity seemed rather far apart to me"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" 16 but I bought some of his videos anyway so I could see a demonstration. I was stunned by what I saw. Clearly and obviously people were getting beyond the most intense of emotions and they were doing so in moments and...the results were long lasting. I had never seen anything close to this....anywhere. I still didn't see the connection between emotions and the body's energy system but it did have a scientific ring to me. Perhaps I was about to find a truly scientific approach to psychology. Indeed, that is what I found. The true cause of negative emotions , it turns out, is not where everyone thinks it is. It is not where psychologists have been looking. That's why they haven't found it. They have been looking in the wrong place. The cause of all negative emotions is involved with the body's energy system . This is an important, paradigm shifting concept...even though it sounds a bit strange. But the proof is in the results. For me, the only laboratory that counts is the real world and that is where these techniques excel. You will see that repeatedly throughout the live recordings included with this course. The speed, efficiency and long lasting nature of these techniques is far beyond anything I have come across in 40 years of intensive searching. This discovery is the engine that runs EFT. Without it, this course wouldn't exist. So to better build your understanding we need to focus a bit on that vital energy system. The body's energy system Our bodies have a profound electrical nature. Any beginning course in anatomy covers this. Shuffle your feet across a carpet and then touch an item made of metal. Sometimes you can see the static electricity that is discharged from your fingertip. This wouldn't be possible unless your body had an electrical nature to it. If you touch a hot stove you will feel the pain instantly because it is electrically transmitted along the nerves to your brain. The pain travels at the speed of electricity and that is why you feel pain so quickly. Electrical messages are constantly sent throughout your body to keep it informed of what is going on. Without this energy flow you would not be able to see, hear, feel, taste or smell. Another obvious bit of evidence regarding the existence of electricity (energy) in the body are the electroencephalograph (EEG) and electrocardiograph (EKG). The EEG records the electrical activity of the brain and the EKG records the electrical activity of the heart . These devices have been used by medical science for decades and are the ones you see in TV hospital dramas hooked up to dying patients. When the screen stops \"blipping\" the patient is dead. Our electrical systems are vital to our physical health. What could be more obvious? When the energy stops flowing....we die. Ask your doctor about this. No one disputes it. In fact, civilization has known about this for millenniums. About 5,000 years ago, the Chinese discovered a complex system of energy circuits that run throughout the body. These energy circuits...or meridians as they are called...are the centerpiece of Eastern health practices and form the basis for modern day acupuncture, acupressure and a wide variety of other healing techniques. This energy courses through the body and is invisible to the eye. It cannot be seen without high tech equipment. By analogy, you do not see the energy flowing through a TV set either. You know it is there, however, by its effects . The sounds and pictures are your ever present evidence that the energy flow exists. In the same way, EFT gives you striking evidence that energy flows within your body because it provides the effects that let you know it is there. By simply tapping near the end points of your energy meridians you can experience some profound changes in your emotional and physical health. These changes would not occur if there was no energy system. Western medical science tends to focus on the chemical nature of the body and has not paid much attention to these subtle, but powerful, energy flows until recent years. However, they do exist and are attracting an expanding group of researchers. Read the following for more details: **Becker, Robert O. and Selden, Gary. The Body Electric. Morrow, NY, 1985 **Becker, Robert O. Crosscurrents. Tarcher, NY, 1992 **Burr, H.S. Blueprint for immortality: the electric patterns of life. Neville Spearman, London, 1972 **Nordenstrom, B. Biologically closed electric circuits: clinical, experimental and theoretical evidence for an additional circulatory system. Nordic, Stockholm, 1983. A growing number of health practitioners are finding ways to use this vital energy system to help physical healing. Acupuncture, massage therapy and chiropractic are but a few of them. Bookstore shelves"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" 17 are loaded with books on energy meridian techniques to promote good physical health. Dr. Callahan's first experience The science behind EFT was not developed like many other discoveries. That is, it was not created in a laboratory and then tested in the real world. Instead, a stunning turn of events in the real world pointed the way first. Here's the story. In 1980 Dr. Roger Callahan was working with a patient, Mary, for an intense water phobia. She suffered from frequent headaches and terrifying nightmares, both of which were related to her fear of water. To seek help, she had been going from therapist to therapist for years....with no material improvement. Dr. Callahan tried to help her by conventional means for a year and a half. He didn't make much headway either. Then one day he stepped outside the normal \"boundaries\" of psychotherapy. Out of curiosity, he had been studying the body's energy system and decided to tap with his fingertips under her eyes (an end point of the stomach meridian). This was prompted by her complaint of some stomach discomfort. To his astonishment, she announced immediately that her phobia was gone and she raced down to a nearby swimming pool and began throwing water in her face. No fear. No headaches. It all went away....including the nightmares. And it has never returned. She is totally free of her water phobia. Results like that are rare in the field of psychotherapy...but commonplace with EFT. The Discovery Statement Now, with this in mind, here's the essence behind EFT. We will refer to it henceforth as the \"Discovery Statement.\" Let's put this in terms of Mary's water phobia. When she was experiencing her fear, the energy flowing through her stomach meridian was disrupted. That energy imbalance is what was causing her emotional intensity. Tapping under her eyes sent pulses through the meridian and fixed the disruption. It balanced it out. Once the energy meridian was balanced the emotional intensity....the fear....went away. Therein lies the most powerful thing you are ever going to learn about your unwanted emotions. They are caused by energy disruptions. Now, let's examine the discovery statement in more detail. First, notice what it does not say. It does not say that a negative emotion is caused by the memory of a past traumatic experience. This is important to recognize because that presumed connection of traumatic memories to negative emotions is a mainstay in conventional psychotherapy. In some circles, it is the accepted practice to “treat the memory” and, in the process, ask the client to repeatedly relive some emotionally painful event. EFT, by contrast, respects the memory but addresses the true cause....a disruption in the body's energy system. People call me from all over the country for help over the telephone. Without my asking, they invariably start telling me in detail about their past traumas. That's because they mistakenly belie ve I need all these details to help them. To them, these memories are the cause of their problems. I care deeply about helping people who needlessly carry around all these emotionally charged memories. That's why I created this course. But it always seems strange to people when I tell them they don't need to painfully relive all those horrid details for EFT to help them. These memories may contribute to an unwanted emotion (you'll see how later), but they are not the direct cause . Accordingly, we don't need to spend time painfully dwelling on them. It is superfluous to do so. Thus there is relatively little emotional suffering involved with EFT. It is relatively painless. You will be asked to briefly recall your problem (there may be some discomfort in that), but that is all. There is no need to relive the pain. In fact, with EFT, generating prolonged emotional discomfort is frowned upon. This is but one example of where EFT is a radical departure from conventional methods. As a further aid to your learning, it might help if you compare the energy flow in your body to that of a TV set. As long as the electricity flows through your TV normally, the sound and picture are both clear. But what would happen if you took off the back of the TV set and poked a screwdriver amongst all that \"electronic spaghetti?\" You would, quite obviously, disrupt or reroute the flow of electricity and an electric \"zzzzzt\" would occur inside. The picture and sound would become erratic The Discovery Statement “The cause of all negative emotions is a disruption in the body’s energy system."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" 18 How a negative emotion is caused Distressing Memory Ste p 1 Ste p 3 Step 2 The Intermediate Step “zzzzzt” A disruption in the body’s energy system Negative Emotion and the TV would exhibit its version of a \"negative emotion.\" In the same manner, when our energy systems become imbalanced, we have an electrical \"zzzzzt\" effect going on inside. Straighten out this \"zzzzzt\" (by tapping—sometimes skillful artistry is necessary—see the recordings) and the negative emotion goes away. It's that simple. I'm well aware of how strange this may sound and how difficult it can be to believe....at least at first. I wouldn't believe it myself if I hadn't seen so many marvelous changes in people after applying these techniques. The intermediate step...the missing piece. Once you accept it, though....once you \"let it in\"....its logic becomes undeniable. It becomes obvious and you begin to see all the weaknesses in other methods. For example, the \"treat the memory\" method mentioned above becomes glaringly erroneous in the light of these discoveries. It is assumed, in that method, that the past traumatic memory is the direct cause of the emotional upset in someone. It is not. There is an intermediate step...a missing piece...between the memory and the emotional upset. And that intermediate step, of course, is the disruption in the body's energy system. It is that disruption, the \"zzzzzt\", that is the direct cause of the emotional upset. This is portrayed graphically below. Please note that if step 2, the intermediate step, does not occur then step 3 is impossible . In other words... if the memory does not cause a disruption in the body's energy system then the negative emotion cannot occur. That is why some people are bothered by their memories and others are not. The difference is that some people have a tendency for their energy systems to become imbalanced under such a memory, while others do not. With this in mind, it is easy to see how the \"treat the memory\" method misses the mark. It addresses step 1 and ignores step 2. This is why some people tend to get worse when conventional psychology aims for the memory and not its cause (the energy disruption). Addressing step 1 by requiring someone to vividly relive a distressing memory serves to induce more disruption in the energy system. And that means more pain, not less. It can, and often does, aggravate the problem. If step 2 was addressed instead of step 1, then there would be relatively little pain. The energy system would be balanced (by appropriate tapping) and internal calm would replace the negative emotion. The result would be rapid relief because the true cause was being addressed. This happens repeatedly with EFT. Now back again to the \"Discovery Statement.\" Please notice that it is all inclusive. It says, \"The cause of ALL negative emotions is a disruption in the body's energy system.\" This includes fears, phobias, anger, grief, anxiety, depression, traumatic memories, PTSD, worry, guilt and all limiting emotions in sports, business and the performing arts. That's a comprehensive list and covers just about every restrictive emotion we can experience. Differently stated, this means that all these negative emotions have the same cau se....an electrical \"zzzzzt\" in the body. It also means... they can all be relieved in a similar manner. Thus, grief has the same basic cause as trauma, guilt, fear and a baseball player's hitting slump. So the same general method can be used for all these problems. This \"one cause\" idea is also a blessing for mental health professionals. They are accustomed to an endless, ever changing number of explanations for the seemingly countless emotional concerns of their clients. To learn that there is only one cause greatly simplifies their efforts. Can you diagnose for energy imbalances? Yes, t he existence of any energy imbalance can be detected using some unique muscle testing diagnostic techniques. Anyone skilled in these techniques could"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" 19 discern which energy meridian(s) were out of balance and would then know precisely where to tap—at least that’s the theory. You need to know, though, that muscle testing requires a great deal of practice and very few become skillful at it. An end run around diagnosis. However, you don't have to know anything about diagnosis to have success with EFT. This is my contribution to these discoveries. EFT creates an effective e nd run around diagnosis. This is not to say that the ability to diagnose is unimportant. In fact, I teach an elegant version of diagnosis in our DVD set, “Steps toward becoming The Ultimate Therapist.” Professional therapists, especially those dealing with clinically disturbed patients, will want to go this extra step. However, the \"100% overhaul concept\" (described next) works admirably as a s ubstitute. Diagnosis is not necessary for the majority of issues with the majority of people. The 100% overhaul concept To understand how this end run works, let's go back to our TV set analogy. Suppose your TV picture is fuzzy....there is a \"zzzzzt\" somewhere inside....and you want it repaired. Now suppose further that your TV repairman has no tools with which to diagnose the problem. He has no way of telling whether you need something major like a new picture tube or something minor like a new capacitor. How then, does he repair your TV? Here's the answer: In order to fix your TV... he overhauls the whole thing-- just as an auto mechanic might overhaul an entire engine. He replaces every electronic gizmo in sight....the picture tube, the resistors, all the wires, every capacitor, etc. Is he overdoing it a bit? Oh sure!. But the important question is, \"Is he likely to fix the problem?\" Oh sure again! In fact, since he is replacing everything, his odds approach 100%. Of course the overhaul will be of limited help if the TV is located in a poor reception area where interference is present. But that's usually not the case. By the same token, a few people (less than 5%) have energy systems that are subject to substantial interference by allergic type reactions. We will discuss more on this topic later. The Basic Recipe . The 100% overhaul concept is EFT's end run around diagnosis. We overdo it. We use a memorized process called The Basic Recipe with which we apply enough tapping procedures to overhaul the whole energy system. This way, our odds of fixing the specific energy imbalance, or \"zzzzzt,\" are greatly enhanced....even though we have no ability to diagnose. The only difference between the TV repairman and EFT is that our overhaul takes only a few minutes.....not days. Therefore it is very practical to do. The 100% overhaul concept requires that you tap near the end points of numerous energy meridians without knowing which of them may be disrupted. In this way you \"overtap\" and will, in the process, tap on some energy meridians that are flowing normally. You might wonder if this does any harm. The answer is no. Thus \"overtapping\", as EFT requires, has the same effect as overhauling a TV set. No harm done....and you'll probably fix what's wrong. Summary so far. To this point we have covered some basic background and discussed what to expect. We have also developed the science behind the techniques and have learned that, \"The cause of all negative emotions is a disruption in the body's energy system.\" This is a radically new discovery and requires thinking outside the normal boundaries to be truly appreciated. We also learned that diagnosing for energy imbalances can be important but is impractical, and unnecessary, to teach in this course. Fortunately, diagnosis can be avoided in a great majority of cases by using the 100% overhaul concept. The 100% overhaul concept requires a memorized tapping procedure. This procedure is the centerpiece of EFT and is referred to as The Basic Recipe. It is your primary tool and \"best friend\" for emotional freedom. You now have the necessary background to appr eciate its power. We cover it next. P.S. As a reminder, please recall from our opening comments that the emotional and energetic releases brought about by EFT frequently result in profound physical healings. "},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"20 The Basic Recipe Like Baking a Cake -- The Setup The Sequence -- 9 Gamut Procedure -- The Sequence (again) The Reminder Phrase -- Adjustments for Subsequent Rounds Like Baking a Cake Our end goal in this course is to equip you with an easy to use recipe for expanding your emotional freedom. I call it The Basic Recipe and the pages that follow are dedicated to its development. A recipe, of course, ha s certain ingredients which must be added in a certain order. If you are baking a cake, for example, you must use sugar instead of pepper and you must add the sugar before you put it in the oven. Otherwise....no cake. The Basic Recipe is no exception. Each ingredient must be performed precisely as described and they must be introduced in the proper order. Otherwise....no result. Although I am going to some length to describe it in detail, The Basic Recipe is very simple and easy to do. Once memorized, each round of it can be performed in about 1 minute . It will take some practice, of course, but af ter a few tries the whole process becomes familiar and you can bake that emotional freedom cake in your sleep. You will then be well on your way to mastery of EFT and all the rewards it provides. Let me interject here that various shortcuts are available and described in Part II of this manual and on Video #1 of Part II. I am describing the full Basic Recipe here because it provides an important foundation to the whole process. However, the proficient practitioner may want to use the shortcuts because they cut the average time involved by at least half. The full Basic Recipe consists of four ingredients...two of which ar e identical. They are: 1. The Setup 2. The Sequence 3. The 9 Gamut Procedure 4. The Sequence They are each treated in detail below. Ingredient #1...The Setup Applying The Basic Recipe is something like going bowling. In bowling, there is a machine that sets up the pins by picking them up and arranging them in perfect order at the end of the alley. Once this \"setup\" is done, all you need to do is roll the ball down the alley to kn ock over the pins. In a similar manner, The Basic Recipe has a beginning routine to \"set up\" your energy system as though it was a set of bowling pins. This routine (called The Setup) is vita l to the whole process and prepares the energy system so that the rest of The Basic Recipe (the ball) can do its job. Your energy system, of course, is not really a set of bowling pins. It is a set of subtle electric circuits. I present this bowling analogy only to give you a sense for the purpose of The Setup and the need to... make sure your energy system is properly oriented before attempting to remove its disruptions. Your energy system is subject to a form of electrical interference which can block the balancing effect of these tapping procedures. When present, this inte rfering blockage must be removed or The Basic Recipe will not work. Removing it is the job of The Setup. Technically speaking, this interfering blockage takes the form of a polarity reversal within your energy system. This is not the same thing as the energy disruptions which cause your negative emotions. Another analogy may help us here. Consider a flashlight or any other devi ce that runs on batteries. If the batteries aren’t ther e, it won’t work. Equally important, the batteries must be installed properly . You’ve noticed, I’m sure, th at batteries have + and - marks on them. Those marks indicate their polarity . If you line up th ose + and - marks according to the instructions, then the electricity flows normally and your flashlight works fine."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"21 But what happens if you put the batteries in backwards? Try it sometime. The flashlight will not work. It acts as if the batteries have been removed. That's what happens when polarity reversal is present in your energy system. It's like your batteries are in backwards. I don't mean you stop working altoge ther....like turn \"toes up\" and die....but your progress does become arrested in some areas. This polarity reversal has an official name. It is ca lled Psychological Reversal and represents a fascinating discovery with wide ranging applications in... all areas of healing and personal performance. It is the reason why some diseases are chronic and respond very poorly to conventional treatments. It is also the reason why some people have such a difficult time losing weight or giving up addictive substances. It is, quite literally, the cause of self sabotage. An entire course could be dedicated to its uses and it is covered in detail in Part II of this course. For now, however, we need only know some foundational things about Psychological Reversal that apply to EFT and...more importantly...how to correct it. Psychological Reversal is caused by self defeating, negative thinki ng which often occurs subconsciously and thus outsi de of your awareness. On average, it will be present...and thus hinder EFT...about 40% of the time. Some people have very little of it (this is rare) while others are beset by it most of the time (this also is rare). Most people fall somewhere in between these two extremes. It doesn't create any feelings within you so you won't know if it is present or not. Even the most positive people are s ubject to it....including yours truly. When it is present it will stop any attempt at healing, including EFT, dead in its tracks. Therefore... It must be corrected if the rest of The Basic Recipe is going to work. Being true to the 100% overhaul concept we correct for Psychological Reversal even though it might not be present . It only takes 8 or 10 seconds to do and, if it isn't present, no harm is done. If it is present, however, a major impediment to your success will be out of the way. That being said, here's how The Setup works. There are two parts to it... 1. You repeat an affirmation 3 times while you... 2. Rub the \"Sore Spot\" or, alternatively, tap the \"Karate Chop\" point (these will be explained shortly). The Affirmation Since the cause of Psychological Reversal involves negative thinking it should be no surprise that the correction for it includes a neutralizing affirmation. Such is the case and here it is. Even though I have this _____________, I deeply and completely accept myself. The blank is filled in with a brief description of the problem you want to address. Here are some examples. **Even though I have this fear of public speaking , I deeply and completely accept myself. **Even though I have this headache , I deeply and completely accept myself. **Even though I have this anger towards my father , I deeply and completely accept myself. **Even though I have this war memory , I deeply and completely accept myself. **Even though I have this stiffness in my neck , I deeply and completely accept myself. **Even though I have these nightmares , I deeply and completely accept myself. **Even though I have this craving for alcohol , I deeply and completely accept myself. **Even though I have th is fear of snakes , I deeply and completely accept myself. **Even though I have this depression , I deeply and completely accept myself. This is only a partial lis t, of course, because the possible issues that are addressable by EFT are endless. Please note that in the videos and audios included with this course, Adrienne and I apply various forms of this affirmation. You may hear us use affirmations like... "},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"22 **\"I accept myself even though I have this_________.\"  or **\"Even though I have this ____________, I deeply and profoundly accept myself.\"  or **\"I love and accept myself even though I have this_______________.\" All of these affirmations are correct because they follow the same general format. That is....they acknowledge the problem and create self acceptance despite the existence of the problem. That is what's necessary for the affirmation to be effective. You can use any of them but I suggest you use the recommended one because it is easily memorizable and has a good track record at getting the job done. Now here are some interesting points about the affirmation... **It doesn't matter whether you believe the affirmation or not....just say it. **It is better to say it with feeling and emphasis but saying it routinely wi ll usually do the job. **It is best to say it ou t loud but if you are in a social situation where you prefer to mutter it under your breath....or do it silently....then go ahead. It will probably be effective. To add to the effectiveness of the affirmation, The Setup also includes the simultaneous rubbing of a \"Sore Spot\"....or.... tapping on the \"Karate Chop\" point. They are described next. The Sore Spot There are two Sore Spots and it doesn't matter which one you use. They are located in the upper left and right portions of the chest and you find them as follows: Go to the base of the throat about where a man would knot his tie. Poke around in this area and you will find a U shaped notch at the top of your sternum (breastbone). From the top of that notch go down 3 inches toward your navel and over 3 inches to your left (or right). You should now be in the upper left (or right) portion of your chest. If you press vigorously in that area (within a 2 inch radius) you will find a \"Sore Spot.\" This is the place you will need to rub while saying the affirmation. This spot is sore when you rub it vigorously because lymphatic congestion occurs there. When you rub it, you are dispersing that congestion. Fortunately, after a few episodes the congestion is all dispersed and the soreness goes away. Then you can rub it with no discomfort whatsoever. I don't mean to overplay the soreness you may feel. It's not like you will have massive, intense pain by rubbing this Sore Spot. It is certainly bearable and should cause no undue discomfort. If it does, then lighten up y our pressure a little. Also, if you've had some kind of operation in that area of the chest or if there's any medical reason whatsoever why you shouldn't be probing around in that spec ific area then switch to the other side. Both sides are equally effective. In any case, if there is any doubt, consult your health practitioner before proceeding....or....tap the \"Karate Chop\" point instead. The Karate Chop Point The Karate Chop point (abbreviated KC ) is located at the center of the fleshy part of the outside of your hand (either hand) between the top of the wrist and the base of the baby finger or....stated differently....the part of your hand you would use to deliver a karate chop. Instead of rubbing it as you would the Sore Spot, you vigorously tap the Karate Chop point with the fingertips of the index finger and middle finger of the other hand. While you could use the Karate Chop point of either hand, it is usually most convenient to tap the Karate Chop point of the non- dominant hand with the two fingertips of the dominant hand. If you are right handed, for"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"23 example, you would tap the Karate Chop point on the left hand with the fing ertips of the right hand. Should you use the Sore Spot or the Karate Chop point? After years of experience with both methods, it has been determined that rubbing the Sore Spot is a bit more effective than tapping the Karate Chop point. It doesn't have a commanding lead by any means but it is preferred. Because The Setup is so important in clearing the way for the rest of The Basic Recipe to work, I urge you to use the Sore Spot rather than the Karate Chop point. It puts the odds a little more in your favor. However, the Karate Chop point is perfectly useful and will clear out any interfering blockage in the vast major ity of cases. So feel free to use it if the Sore Spot is inappropriate for any reason. You will notice on the videos that I often instruct people to tap th e Karate Chop point instead of rub the Sore Spot. That's because it is easier to teach when I'm on stage. Stepping Through It Now that you understand the parts to The Setup, performing it is easy. You create a word or short phrase to fill in the blank in the affirmation and then... simply repeat the affirmation, with emphasis, 3 times while continuously rubbing the Sore Spot or tapping the Karate Chop point. That's it. After a few practice rounds, you should be able to perform The Setup in 8 seconds or so. Now, with The Setup properly performed, you are ready for the next ingredient in The Basic Recipe....The Sequence. Ingredient #2...The Sequence The Sequence is very simple in concept. It involves tapping on the end points of the major energy meridians in the body and is the method by which the \"zzzzzt\" in the energy system is balanced out. Before locating these points for you, however, you need a few tips on how to carry out the tapping process. Tapping tips: You can tap with either hand but it is usually more convenient to do so with your dominant hand (e.g. right hand if you are right handed). Tap with the fingertips of your index finger and middle finger. This covers a little larger area than just tapping with one fingertip and allows you to cover the tapping points more easily. Tap solidly but never so hard as to hurt or bruise yourself. Tap about 7 times on each of the tapping points. I say about 7 times because you will be repeating a \"reminder phrase\" (covered later) while tapping and it will be difficult to count at the same time. If you are a little over or a l ittle under 7 (5 to 9, for example) that will be sufficient. Most of the tapping points exist on either side of the body. It doesn't matter which side you use nor does it matter if you swit ch sides during The Sequence. For example, you can tap under your right eye and, later in The Sequence, tap under your left arm. The points: Each energy meridian has two end points. For the purposes of The Basic Recipe, you need only tap on one end to balance out any disruptions that may exist in it. These end points are near the surface of the body and are thus more readily accessed than other points along the meridians that may be more deeply buried. What follows are instructions on how to locate the end points of those meridians that are important to The Basic Recipe. Taken together....and done in the order presented....they form The Sequence. **At the beginning of the eyebrow, just above and to one side of the nose. This point is abbreviated EB for beginning of the E ye B row. **On the bone bordering the outside corner of the eye. This point is abbreviated SE for S ide of the E ye. **On the bone under an eye about 1 inch below your pupil. This poi nt is abbreviated UE for U nder the E ye. **On the small area betwee n the bottom of your nose and the top of your upper lip. This point is abbreviated UN for U nder the N ose. "},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"24 **Midway between the point of your chin and the bottom of your lower lip. Even though it is not directly on the point of the chin, we call it the chin point because it is descriptive enough for people to understand easily. This point is abbreviated Ch for Ch in. **The junction where the sternum (breastbone), collarbone and the first rib meet. To locate it, first place your forefinger on the U-shaped notch at the top of the breastbone (about where a man would knot his tie). From the bottom of the U, move your forefinger down toward the navel 1 inch and then go to the left (or right) 1 inch. This point is abbreviated CB for C ollar B one even though it is not on the collarbone (or clavicle) per se. It is at the beginning of the collarbone and we call it the collarb one point because that is a lot easier to say than \"the junction where the sternum (breastbone), collarbone and the first rib meet. \" **On the side of the body, at a point even with the nipple (for men) or in the middle of the bra strap (for women). It is about 4 inches below the armpit. This point is abbreviated UA for U nder the A rm. **For men, one inch below the nipple. For ladies, where the underskin of the breast meets the chest wall. This point is abbreviated BN for B elow N ipple. As discussed below, this point has been added for this edition. **On the outside edge of your thumb at a point even with the base of the thumbnail. This point is abbreviated Th for Th umb. **On the side of your index finger (the side facing your thumb) at a point even with the base of the fingernail. This point is abbreviated IF for I ndex F inger. **On the side of your middle finger (the side closest to your thumb) at a point even with the base of the fingernail. This point is abbreviated MF for M iddle F inger. **On the inside of your baby finger (the side closest to your thumb) at a point even with the base of the fingernail. This point is abbreviated BF for B aby F inger. **The last point is the karate chop point....which has been previously described under the section on The Setup. It is located in the middle of the fleshy part on the outside of the hand between the top of the wrist bone and the base of the baby finger. It is abbreviated KC for K arate C hop.  BN"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"25 The Setup The Sequence (Bread) 9 Gamut (Ham) The Sequence (Bread) The abbreviations for these points are summarized below in the same order as given above.

That is, each tapping point is below the one before it. That should make it a snap to memorize. A few trips through it and it should be yours forever. Also note that the BN point has been added since the making of the videos that accompany this course. It was originally left out because it was awkward for ladies to tap wh ile in social situations (restaurants, etc.). Even though the EFT results have been superb without it, I include it now for completeness. Ingredient #3...The 9 Gamut Procedure The 9 Gamut Procedure is, perhaps, the most bizarre looking process with in EFT. Its purpose is to \"fine tune\" the brain a nd it does so via some eye movements and some humming and counting. Through connecting nerves, certain parts of the brain are stimulated when the eyes are moved. Likewise the right side of the brain (the creative side) is engaged when you hum a song and the left side (the digital side) is engaged when you count. The 9 Gamut Procedure is a 10 second process wherein 9 of these \"brain stimulating\" actions are performed while continuous ly tapping on one of the body's energy points.....the Gamut point. It has been found, after years of experience, that this routine can add efficiency to EFT and hastens your progress towards emotional freedom....especially when sandwiched between 2 trips through The Sequence. One way to help memorize The Basic Recipe is to look at it as though it was a ham sandwich. The Setup is the preparation for the ham sandwich and the sandwich itself consists of two slices of bread (The Sequence) with the ha m, or middle portion, as the 9 Gamut Procedure. It looks like this... To do the 9 Gamut Procedure, you must first locate the Gamut point. It is on the back of either hand and is 1/2 inch behind the midpoint between the knuckles at the base of the ring finger and the little finger. If you draw an imaginary line between the knuckles at the base of the ring finger and little finger and consider that line to be the base of an equilateral triangle whose other sides converge to a point (apex) in the direction of the wrist, th en the gamut point would be located at the apex of the triangle. Next, you must perform 9 different actions while tapping the Gamut point continuously. The 9 Gamut actions are: 1. Eyes closed. 2. Eyes open. 3. Eyes hard down right while holding the head steady. 4. Eyes hard down left while holding the head steady. 5. Roll eyes in a circle as though your nose was at the center of a clock and you were trying to see all the numbers in order. 6. Same as #5 only reverse the direction in which you roll your eyes. 7. Hum 2 seconds of a song (suggest Happy Birthday). 8. Count rapidly from 1 to 5. 9. Hum 2 seconds of a song again. The Ham Sandwich"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"26 Note that these 9 actions are presented in a certain order and I suggest that you memorize them in the order given. However, you can mix the order up if you wish so long as you do all 9 of them.... and ....you perform 7, 8 and 9 as a unit. That is, you hum 2 seconds of a song...then count...then hum the song ag ain, in that order. Years of experience have proven this to be important. Also, note that for some people humming Happy Birthday causes resistance because it brings up memories of unhappy birthd ays. In this case, you can either use EFT on those unhappy memories and resolve them...or...you can side step this issue for now by having them hum some other song. Ingredient #4...The Sequence (again) The fourth...and last...ingredient in The Basic Recipe was mentioned above. It is an identical trip through The Sequence. The Reminder Phrase Once memorized, The Basic Recipe becomes a lifetime friend. It can be applied to an almost endless list of emotional and physical problems and provides relief from most of them. However, there's one more concept we need to develop before we can apply The Basic Recipe to a given problem. It's called the Reminder Phrase. When a football quarterback throws a pass he aims it at a particular receiver. He doesn't just throw the ball in the air and hope someone will catch it. Likewise, The Basic Recipe needs to be aimed at a specific problem. Otherwise, it will bounce around aimlessly with little or no effect. You \"aim\" The Basic Recipe by applying it while \"tuned in\" to th e problem from which you want relief. This tells your system which problem needs to be the receiver. Remember the discovery statement which states... \"The cause of all negative emotions is a disruption in the body's energy system.\" Negative emotions come about because you are tuned into certain thought s or circumstances which, in turn, cause your energy system to disrupt. Otherwise, you function nor mally. One's fear of heights is not present, fo r example, while one is reading the comic section of the Sunday newspaper (and therefore not tuned in to the problem). Tuning in to a problem can be done by simply thinking about it. In fact, tuning in means thinking about it. Thinking about the problem will bring about the energy disruptions involved which then....and only then....can be balanced by applying The Basic Recipe. Without tuning in to the problem....thereby creating those energy disruptions....The Basi c Recipe does nothing. Tuning in is seemingly a very simple process. You merely think about the problem while applying The Basic Recipe. That's it....at least in theory. However, you may find it a bit difficult to consciously think about the problem while you are tapping, humming, counting, etc. That's why I'm introducing a Reminder Phrase that you can repeat continually while you are performing The Basic Recipe. The Reminder Phrase is simply a word or short phrase that describes the problem and that you repeat out loud each time you tap one of the points in The Sequence. In this way you continually \"remind\" your system about the problem you are working on. The best Reminder Phrase to use is usually identical to what you c hoose for the affirmation you use in The Setup. For example, if you are working on a fear of public speaking, The Setup affirmation would go like this.... Even though I have this fear of public speaking , I deeply and completely accept myself. Within this affirmation, the underlined words....fear of public speaking ....are ideal candidates for use as the Reminder Phrase. You may notice that Adri enne and I sometimes use a bit shorter version of this Reminder Phrase when dealing with people on the recordings included with this course. We might, for example, use \"public speaking fear\" or just \"public speaking\" instead of the somewhat longer version above. That's just one of the shortcuts we have grown accustomed to after years of experience with these techniques. For your purposes, however, you can simplify your life by just using the identical words for the Reminder Phrase as you use for the"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"27 affirmation in The Setup. That way you will minimize any possibility for error. Now here's an interesting point that you will most certainly notice on the audios and some of the videos. When Adrienne and I are helping people with EFT we don't always have them repeat a Reminder Phrase. That's because we have discovered over time that simply stating the affirmation during The Set up is usually sufficient to \"tune in\" to the problem at hand. The subconscious mind usually locks on to the problem throughout The Basic Reci pe even though all the tapping, humming, counting, etc. would seem to be distracting. But this is not always true and, with our extensive training and experience, we are able to recognize whether or not using the Reminder Phrase is necessary. As stated, it is not usually necessary but.... when it is necessary it is really necessary and must be used . What's beautiful about EFT is that you don't need to have our experience in this regard. You don't have to be able to figure out whether or not the Reminder Phrase is necessary. You can just assume it is always necessary and thereby assure yourself of always being t uned in to the problem by simply repeating the Reminder Phrase as instructed. It does no harm to repeat the Reminder Phrase when it is not necessary and will serve as an invaluable tool when it is. This is part of the 100% overhaul concept mentione d earlier. We do many things in each round of Th e Basic Recipe that may not be necessary for a given problem. But when a particular part of The Basic Recipe is necessary... it is absolutely critical. It does no harm to include everything...even what may be unnecessary...and it only takes 1 minute per round. This includes always repeating the Reminder Phrase each time you tap a point during The Sequence. It costs nothing to include it....not even time....because it can be repeated within the same time it takes to tap each energy point 7 times. This concept about the Reminder Phrase is an easy one. But just to be complete, I am including a few samples below: **headache **anger towards my father **war memory **stiffness in my neck **nightmares **craving for alcohol **fear of snakes **depression Subsequent Round Adjustments Let's say you are using The Basic Recipe for some problem (fear, headache, anger, etc.). Sometimes the problem will simply vanish after just one round while, at other times, one round provides only partial relie f. When only partial relief is obtained, you will need to do one or more additional rounds. Those subsequent rounds need to be adjusted slightly for best results. Here's why: One of the main reasons why the first round doesn't always completely eliminate a problem is because of the re-emergence of Psychological Reversal...that interfering blockage that The Setup is designed to correct. This time, Psychological Reversal shows up in a somewhat different form. Instead of blocking your progress altogether it now blocks any remaining progress. You have already made some headway but become stopped part way toward complete relief because Psychological Reversal enters in a manner that keeps you from getting any better still. Since the subconscious mind tends to be very literal, the subsequent rounds of The Basic Recipe need to address the fact that you are working on the remaining problem . Accordingly, the affirmation contained within The Setup needs to be adjusted as does the Reminder Phrase. Here's the adjusted format for The Setup affirmation: Even though I still have some of this __________, I deeply and completely accept myself. Please note the emphasized words ( still & some ) and how they change the thrust of the affirmation toward the remainder of the problem. It should be easy to make this adjustment and, after a little experience, you will fall in to it quite naturally. Study the adjusted affirmations below. They reflect adjustments to the original affirmations shown earlier in this section. "},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"28 **Even though I still have some of this fear of public speaking , I deeply and completely accept myself. **Even though I still have some of this headache , I deeply and completely accept myself. **Even though I still have some of this anger towards my father , I deeply and completely accept myself. **Even though I still have some of this war memory , I deeply and completely accept myself. **Even though I still have some of this stiffness in my neck , I deeply and completely accept myself. **Even though I still have some of these nightmares , I deeply and completely accept myself. **Even though I still have some of this craving for alcohol , I deeply and completely accept myself. **Even though I still have some of this fear of snakes , I deeply and completely accept myself. **Even though I still have some of this depression , I deeply and completely accept myself. The Reminder Phrase is also easily adjusted. Just put the word remaining before the previously used phrase. Here, as examples, are adjusted versions of the previous Reminder Phrases. **remaining headache **remaining anger towards my father **remaining war memory **remaining stiffness in my neck **remaining nightmares **remaining craving for alcohol **remaining fear of snakes **remaining depression This completes the features of The Basic Recipe. You now need two things to be effective with it. You need to memorize it and you need a few tips on how to apply it . Those tips are next. Tips on How to Apply EFT Testing • Aspects -- Persistence Pays -- Be Specific Where Possible The Generalization Effect -- Try It On Everything -- EFT in a Nutshell EFT is remarkably simple to apply. Just customize the 1 minute Basic Recipe with a Setup affirmation and Reminder Phrase that aims at your problem. Then do as many rounds as necessary until the problem is gone. This easy process can be used, with persistence, to literally re-engineer your system. It will unload the fears, anger, grief, depression and other negative emotions that cause people to drive through life with their brakes on. And....along the way....it may give you relief from headaches, asthma, pain and a seemingly unending list of physical ailments. This section of the course adds a few tips...some useful insights...so you can make better use of EFT. It takes you behind the scenes and helps you build a firmer foundation beneath your new skills. Testing You will notice on the videos and audios that Adrienne and I are constantly asking people to evaluate the extent of their problem on a scale of 0 to 10 (where 10 represents maximum intensity and 0 represents no intensity whatsoever). This provides a benchmark against which to measure your progress. You might start at a 6, for instance, and then go to a 3....and then a 1....and finally to 0....as various rounds of The Basic Recipe are applied. You should always measure the intensity as it exists NOW....as you think about it....and not as you think it would be in the actual situation. Remember, The Basic Recipe balances the disruptions in your energy system as they exist NOW while you are tuned in to the thought or circumstance. Here's an example of how it works. Let's say you have a fear of spiders that you would like to put behind you. If there is no spider present to cause you any emotional intensity"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"29 then close your eyes and imagine seeing a spider or imagine a past time when a spider scared you. Assess your intensity on a scale of 0 to 10 as it exists NOW while you think about it . If you estimate it at a 7, for example, then you have a benchmark against which to measure your progress. Now do one round of The Basic Recipe and imagine the spider again. If you can get no trace whatsoever of your previous emotional intensity then you are done. If, on the other hand, you go to, let's say, a 4 then you need to perform subsequent rounds until 0 is reached. Aspects You might wonder at this point if getting to 0 while just thinking about a spider will hold up when you are actually confronted with a real spider. The answer is usually.... yes!! In most cases, the energy disruptions that occur while thinking about the spider are the same as those when you are in the presence of a real spider. That's why the original energy balancing tends to hold in the real circumstances. The exception to this is when some new aspect of the problem comes up in the real situation that wasn't there when you were just thinking about it. For example, you may have been thinking about a stationary spider that didn't move. If that movement is an important aspect of your fear and...if it was absent from your thinking when the original rounds were done...then that part of the fear will arise when you see a moving spider. This is a reasonably common occurrence and it doesn't mean that EFT didn't work. It simply means there is more to do. Just apply The Basic Recipe to the new aspect (moving spider) until your emotional response goes to 0. Once all aspects have been eliminated your phobic response to spiders will be history and you will be perfectly calm around them. The notion of aspects is an important one in EFT. As in the spider example above, some problems have many pieces...or aspects...to them and the problem will not be completely relieved until all of them are addressed. Actually, each of these aspects qualifies as a separate problem even though they seem to be all lumped together. The fear of a stationary spider and the fear of a moving spider, for example, would seem to be lumped together. In fact, they are separate problems and need to be addressed separately by EFT. Different aspects are possible with just about any problem you want to address with EFT. Sometimes they take the form of a series of traumatic memories such as memories of war, abuse or rape. Each of those memories may be a separate problem, or aspect, and needs to be addressed indi vidually before complete relief is obtained. Please understand that where several aspects of an emotional problem are present, you may not notice any relief until all aspects are re duced to 0 by The Basic Recipe. This becomes very clear when you compare it to its counterpart in physical healing. If, for example, you have a simultaneous headache, toothache and stomach ache, you will not feel healthy until all 3 are gone. The pain may seem to shift but it is, nonetheless, still pain. So it is with emotional issues that contain different aspects. Until all aspects are gone you may not feel you are getting relief even though you have taken care of 1 or more aspects. Persistence Pays As a newcomer to EFT, you may lack the experience to be able to identify sp ecific aspects and address them individually with The Basic Recipe. That's okay. You need only go with whatever feeling you are having and address that feeling with The Basic Recipe. Your subconscious mind knows what you are working on. You might address this \"feeling\" with a Setup affirmation that goes... \"Even though I have this feeling , I deeply and completely accept myself\" and a Reminder Phrase that says... \"this feeling.\" Please understand that the majority of the problems The Basic Recipe addresses are not laden with numerous aspects. Most problems are easy to identify and just as easily relieved. But just in case you happen to have one of tho se more involved problems and you are unable to identify specific aspects of it, then I suggest you do 3 rounds of The Basic Recipe for \"this feeling\" or \"this problem\" once per day (that's about 3 minutes per day) for 30 days. Your subconscious mind has a way of bringing up what is necessary and you should have relief long before the 30 days are up. EFT, as you can tell, is... a very flexible process... and will often make progress on problems that are outside your awareness."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"30 Be Specific Where Possible It is best, of course, to be specific whenever you can. That way you can efficiently zero in on an exact fear, pain, memory etc., and eliminate it from your limiting baggage. Sometimes we lump together a number of specific problems under a larger heading. This can handicap your progress with EFT. For example, most people would like to have a better \"self image\" but don't realize that the term is a general label which serves as a catchall phrase for numerous specific problems (e.g. memories of abuse, rejection, failure and/or fears of various kinds). Someone who has been subject to severe rejection as a child is likely to feel inadequate in many areas of their life. This contributes to their poor self image by causing energy disruptions (and hence negative emotions) when they face potential rejection. Accordingly, they consistently feel \"not good enough\" when given opportunities and tend to stay stuck where they are in life. When lumped together with other negative emotions, self image problems become more widely generalized and the person feels stopped in even more areas. I use a metaphor to put self image and other general emotional labels into proper EFT perspective. I liken the general problem to a... diseased forest in which each of the underlying specific issues is a negative tree. The forest, at first, is so densely populated with trees that it may seem impossible to find your way out. To some, it may even seem like a jungle. When we neutralize each specific negative event in our lives with The Basic Recipe we are, effectively, cutting down a negative tree. Continue cutting down these trees and, after a while, the forest will have thinned out so you can walk out of it rather easily. Each toppled tree represents another degree of emotional freedom and...if you are persistent with The Basic Recipe...you will gradually find your negative responses subsiding. You will find yourself at ease...and calm...when faced with new opportunities and you will be guided by a new sense of adventure rather than by a fear of not being \"good enough.\" One very helpful concept here is to break down problems into the specific events that underlie them and use EFT on each such specific event. For example, if you have anger because your father abused you, apply EFT to specific events like, ”When Dad hit me in the kitchen at age 8.” This is often superior to using EFT on the more global issue of “My father abused me.” Perhaps the biggest mistake made by newcomers is that they try to use EFT on issues that are too global. They may make good headway with persistence but they are less likely to notice the results right away. As a result, they may quit too soon. Break the problems down into specific events and you will notice results on those specific events right away. Doing this also addresses the true cause and is usually more efficient. The Generalization Effect That being said, I want to acquaint you now with a fascinating feature of EFT. I call it The Generalization Effect because, after you address a few related problems with EFT, the process starts to generalize over all those problems. For example, someone who has 100 traumatic memories of being abused usually finds that after using EFT... they all vanish after neutralizing only 5 or 10 of them. This is startling to some people because they have so many traumas in their life they think they are in for unending sessions with these techniques. Not so...at least not usually. EFT often clears out a whole forest after cutting down just a few trees. For an example of this Generalization Effect review the case with Rich, the first Veteran on the “6 Days at the VA” video included with this course. Try It On Everything!! This course is replete with case histories. Their purpose is to imbed within you how EFT works in the real world. There's a whole section on them in this manual and the videos and a udios contain many more. They span issues... **from the fear of public speaking to intense war memories, **from chocolate cravings to insomnia and **from hiccups to multiple sclerosis. I know of no limit to the emotional and physical problems which can be addressed by EFT. Accordingly, I TRY IT ON EVERYTHING!! and urge you to do the same. People are forever asking me, \"Will it work on _____?\" and I always respond with, \"Try it!\" I have given up being surprised at the results. Headway is usually gained. However, this “Try it on everything” idea must be interpreted with common sense. It’s purpose is to expand your awareness of EFT’s possibilities. It is not a license to act irresponsibly. Accordingly, you should not try EFT on serious mental illnesses or anything else UNLESS you are properly trained or qualified in that area.

Their questions are openly enthusiastic. Others don't quite know how to respond because EFT violates most of their beliefs about personal improvement. Their questions contain an element of caution...as though they are semi-open but still need to protect their existing beliefs. Whatever their source, these questions are important to your education in EFT because they help fill in any gaps you may have in your understanding. For this purpose, I am displaying in this section the answers to the standard questions I have received over the years. Q. How do EFT results differ from a \"quick fix?\" The label \"quick fix\" carries with it a negative connotation and is often used to label the questionable healing techniques of huckste rs and cheats. The term goes hand in hand with the term \"con man\" and, when used, often brings about thoughts of suspicion and caution. EFT offers rapid relief from numerous emotional and physical ailments without meriting the negative label \"quick fix.\" This is obvious to any observer of the case histories in this course and is even more obvious to those students who have experienced the results first hand. I use the term rapid relief instead of \"quick fix\" to put across the same id ea but without the negative connotation. Now here's an important note: Throughout history healing techniques of various kinds have usually been slow and inefficient until someone finds the true remedy for the ailment. When the true remedy is found, everything changes and the old methods become relics of the past. Polio is a case in point. Until the Salk Vaccine was discovered, Poliomyelitis was considered incurable and all manners of medications and therapies (including the Iron Lung) were employed to help the sufferers. They didn't do much, of course. They helped ease some of the discomfort and limited some of the long term damage caused by the disease. But that was about it. And then came the Salk Vaccine. It did away with all the antiquated, inefficient attempts at curing Polio and replaced them with a true remedy. It was, indeed, a \"quick fix\" without the negative connotation. The eradication of Polio is only one example where inefficient methods give away to true remedies. Penicillin, for instance, has been another \"quick fix\" miracle drug that has provided instant cures for illnesses ranging from respiratory diseases to gonorrhea. The examples go on and on, of course, but the point is that these procedures are replacing all the inefficient techniques used in behalf of emotional health. The fact that they give rapid relief to seemingly difficult emotional problems is impressive evidence that they represent the true remedy. If they took forever to do very little then they should simply take their place among the other ho hum techniques of the past. But they don't. They hit the bulls eye and perform as a true remedy should. Quickly, easily, permanently. Q. Does it last? This question is usually a companion to the above \"quick fix\" question. After all, the \"logic\" goes, any problem that can be relieved that fast must be temporary. Lasting results, at least in the minds of most people, must take time to produce. Not so. EFT's results are usually permanent. The case histories in this course are filled with people who have had lasti ng results...even though the problem was relieved in moments. This is still more evidence that EFT is addressing the true cause of the problem. Otherwise, the remedy would not be so long lasting. Please remember, however, that EFT doesn't do everything for everyone. Some problems seem to reappear and that is usually caused by different aspects of the original problem showing up at a later time. The experienced student of EFT will recognize this and simply reapply The Basic Recipe for this new aspect. The experienced student will also break the problem down into specific events and apply EFT to those underlying causes. In time, after all aspects and specific events have been addressed, the problem usually goes away completely and does not return. Q. How does EFT handle emotional problems that are very intense and/or have been with a person for a very long time? The same way it handles every other emotional problem. To EFT, the intensity of a problem or how long it has been around is immaterial. The cause is always a disrupted energy system and using The Basic Recipe to balance it gives relief...regardless of its severity."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"34 This question usually comes about because of the belief that intense and/or long resident problems are more \"deeply ingrained\" than other problems. Therefore it should take more effort to relieve them. This seems very logical when viewed through conventional approaches because conventional approaches don't directly address the true cause. Conventional approaches tend to take aim at one's memories or other mental processes and ignore the energy system (where the true cause lies). When slow progress is being made it is convenient to blame the problem because it is presumed to be \"deeply ingrained\" or otherwise difficult to deal with. In this manner, conventional approaches can...and do...explain away ineffective results. When EFT requires persistence it is NOT because of the intensity or resident length of a problem. It is usually because of a problem's complexity. Complexity, to EFT, means the existence of several aspects to a problem each of which must be relieved before total relief is felt. The notion of aspects is covered repeatedly in this manual, the videos and the audios. Note: The above comments may or may not apply to serious mental illness. The application of EFT to such disorders has proven helpful but it should only be applied by a professional skilled in this area. Q. How does EFT deal with one's need to understand their problem? This is one of the most astonishing features about EFT. A shift in a person's understanding of their prob lem happens simultaneously with the relief. After EFT, people talk about their problem differently. They put it in a healthy perspective. The typical rape victim, for example, no longer carries a deep fear and distrust of men. Rather, she considers her assailant(s) to have the problem and in need of help. People who use EFT for relief from guilt no longer take blame for whatever event gave rise to the guilt. Anger turns to objectivity. Grief turns to a healthy, more peaceful perspective about the death of a loved one. Notice how you and others respond to your former problem and you will see what I mean. Your understanding shifts right along with the relief. Here's a final note on how powerfully EFT shifts understanding. In the hundreds and hundreds of people Adrienne and I have helped with EFT not one of them...ever...has made any re quest to better understand their problem. Why would they? There was no need. Q. How does EFT deal with stress and anxiety? In EFT, stress and anxiety have the same cause as all other negative emotions...a disruption in the body's energy system. Accordingly, they are addressed with The Basic Recipe the same as any other emotional issue. Anxiety has a specific meaning in clinical psychology. It refers to an intense fear or dread lacking an unambiguous cause or a specific threat. In EFT, however, we give it a much broader definition to include that general state of uneasiness which is more commonly known as anxiety. Under that definition stress and anxiety fall into the same category. Stress and anxiety tend to be ongoing problems because the circumstances that create them are ongoing. An abusive family situation or a stressful job environment are but two of a long list of possibilities. EFT does not do away with the circumstances, of course, but it is an important aid to reducing your anxious responses. In most cases, EFT will need to be used persistently (most likely daily) because the stressful circumstances tend to show up every day. After a while, you should notice that your responses to difficult events is much calmer. Things just don't get to you like they used to. You smile more. Your health improves and life seems easier. Q. How does EFT help with sports performance? Ask any accomplished athlete and they will tell you emphatically that their mental set is critical to their performance. The difference between good days and bad days for the athlete is almost always due to emotional causes. Barring sickness, the athlete always brings the same highly skilled body into the field of battle. The only thing that changes is the effect that emotions have on the body. Everyone, including athletes, has their share of negative thoughts and self doubt. By now you are quite familiar with the fact that those negative states of mind disrupt the body's energy system and cause negative emotions. These negative emotions show up in the body in a variety of ways (pounding heart, tears, sweat, etc.) and this includes some tension in the muscles. In athletics, timing is everything and even the slightest tension in the muscles affects it. Hitting a baseball, tennis ball or golf ball requires perfect timing and being off by just 1/8 of an inch is the difference between hitting a home run and flying out...or...hitting a killer serve or one that hits the net...or...making or missing a putt. And so it goes. Athletes are well aware of this problem and many hire sports psychologists to help them in this regard. Any negative emotion...even the mild ones and the subconscious ones...can be critical to an athlete's performance."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"35 EFT provides a remarkably effective solution to this problem. The purpose of The Basic Recipe is to neutralize negative emotions and their effects. One of the most common responses to it is that people feel relaxed which, by the way, is another way of saying that the tension has left their muscles. This is ideal for the athlete because it neutralizes any unnecessary emotional tension in the muscles without affecting the rest of their athletic ability. It allows their potential to flow through without being hindered by any resistance in the muscles. Q. Why does EFT give surprisingly good relief from physical problems? This is easy to understand in light of the emerging attitudes toward the existence of the mind-body connection. EFT provides striking evidence of this connection. What more obvious proof could one want than to watch changes in both mind and body occur as a result of tapping on the body's energy system? But the evidence goes even deeper than this. Applying EFT for emotional issues often brings on the cessation of physical problems. Breathing problems go away. Headaches vanish. Join t pains subside. Multiple Sclerosis symptoms improve. I have witnessed this phenomenon for years. The list of physical improvements brought about by EFT is endless. The logical inference from this is that EFT effectively addresses any emotional contributors to one's physical symptoms. Once the emotional contributors are out of the way the symptom subsides. There are those, of course, who believe that one's emotions or mental processes are the only cause of their physical diseases. I don't know how to prove or disprove that notion but I offer here the rather obvious fact that emotions, at the very least, substantially contribute to one's physical health. And EFT is an efficient tool for relief in this regard. One final note on this. You might wonder what is happening \"behind the emotional scenes\" when you apply The Basic Recipe directly to a physical symptom (such as a headache) without zeroing in on a specific emotion. Stated differently, if the physical symptom is caused by some emotional issue then why does the physical symptom experience relief when no specific emotion was addressed? I don't know for sure. There is much to learn about these techniques and the future, I'm sure, will bring us some exciting revelations on many fronts. For now, I believe that the subconscious mind brings up whatever emotional issue is contributing to the cause of the physical symptom. Applying The Basic Recipe automatically addresses that emotion. Q. How can I keep up to date with the latest advances in EFT? Although you can generate impressive results with EFT, you must recognize that you are just beginning. EFT is capable of far more than what you are learning in this course.

They demonstrate EFT in action on a wide variety of problems and give you an invaluable sense of what to expect. Please read them all...even if some of them do not appear to directly apply to you. There is a lot of overlap in how these techniques work and what applies to one problem may also apply in another. Further, an important part of your EFT education is to recognize the various APPROACHES that can be used on a wide variety of ailments. EFT applies to almost every emotional and physical ailment known to mankind and the procedure itself is basically the same for each ailment. However, the APPROACHES can vary widely. While the following case histories give you some sense of the varying approaches, the videos accompanying this course are much more useful in this regard. We are limited in what we can do on the printed page. Case history #1 - Fear of public speaking Sue had a speech impediment that resulted in an advanced fear of public speaking. She attended one of our workshops and asked Adrienne and me for some help during the lunch break. She showed us a scar on her neck where an operation for throat cancer had been performed. As a result of her operation, she could not speak normally and it was difficult to understand her. She was understandably terrified of public speaking and...to make matters worse...she was a Sergeant in the Army and had to \"public speak\" frequently in front of her troops. We applied 2 rounds of The Basic Recipe and she overcame the fear in a few minutes...at least while thinking about it. When the workshop reconvened, I asked her to come up on stage to test her fear of public speaking. As she walked to ward the stage she reported that her fear was upon her again but it was \"only a 3,\" she said. This was much less than the 10 she usually felt but, obviously, there was still some left. This is prime evidence that some new aspect of her fear was emerging that wasn't present in her thinking during the break. We applied one more round of The Basic Recipe on stage (while she faced the audience) and the fear fell to zero. She then grabbed my microphone, asked me to sit down and enchanted this audience of 100 people as she told the story of what happened over the break. She was filled with calm and poise. The speech impediment was still there, of course. But the fear was gone. Does eliminating the fear of public speaking make someone a great speaker? No, of course not. Public speaking is an art and takes practice to perfect. What it does do, though, is remove the pounding heart, dry mouth and other fear symptoms so that one is free and comfortable in developing their public speaking skills. Case history #2 - Asthma Kelly sat in the front row at one of my presentations. Her asthma was obvious as I could hear her labored breathing throughout my talk. It was severe enough to sound something like a mild snore and clearly annoyed some of the people near her. After the presentation, she asked me to help her with her fear of public speaking. Interesting, she did not \"get\" that EFT could relieve asthma so she didn't ask for help on this obvious problem. To her, nothing but medicine could help. So we addressed her fear of public speaking. About 3 minutes into the EFT procedures she remarked, with a bit of astonishment in her voice, that her breathing had eased. And indeed it had. There was no sign of asthma. We often get \"bonus results \" like this. Balancing the body's energy system can pay great dividends."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"37 As of this writing, I have only addressed a handful of problems (maybe 8 or 10) that involve asthma, breathing or sinus related problems. I have seen clear progress in each case. I mean by this that there was immediate relief every time EFT was applied. I'm not saying, however, that EFT eliminated the problem forever, as is often the case with emotional issues. Sometimes the breathing problem comes back and requires additional rounds of EFT. Please understand that I apply EFT to more people than I can count and it is impractical for me to follow up on all of them. So I don't know how many need to repeat the procedures to relieve asthma symptoms. I only know that there is a high likelihood for relief. If you are an asthma sufferer, you have an excellent chance of gaining relief from your problem. Please do this with the aid of your physician, however. Case history #3 - Sexual abuse Bob was repeatedly subjected to sexual abuse as a youngster. His memories of it were very intense and created great anger within him. The abusive events were almost 30 years ago and he knew, logically, that retaining the anger was costing him his peace of mind. Emotionally, however, he couldn't seem to shake it. It took two unusual sessions to give him relief on this issue. I say unusual because it was done in a workshop environment in front of other people. He understandably didn't want to discuss this with others so I helped him apply EFT to the memories while he maintained privacy in his own mind. This is easily done with EFT because all that is required is that the client \"tune in\" to the problem while performing the tapping techniques. The \"tuning in\" can be done privately. I ran into Bob about a month later and he said he \"didn't think about it much any more.\" This is a typical response after using EFT. Even the most intense issues tend to fade away. Sometimes people report that, after EFT, they can't even think about the memory. That is inaccurate. But it does seem that way. The memory doesn't really go away because, when I ask them to describe it, they can still do so in great detail. What happens is the emotional sting vanishes and thus the memory doesn't come up in the same way. It is now a mild event from the past. It just seems like they can no longer think about it because it is missing a previously powerful ingredient. This is what you want, of course. We are looking for emotional freedom here...not amnesia. EFT was not 100% successful in this case, however, because Bob still had occasional, relatively mild, bouts with the memories. But it's nothing like it was. He can probably eliminate it completely if he persistently uses these techniques over time. Case history #4 - Anxiety and fingernail biting Susan had an ongoing level of anxiety and chose to do EFT frequently throughout the day. She did this for several months and, as her anxiety level subsided, she quit biting her fingernails (a lifelong habit)....without even trying. She picked up her guitar one day and noticed that her fingernails were too long to play it. EFT sometimes works in subtle ways and positive side effects like this often happen outside your awareness. When your life returns to normal in some area (like anxiety) it seems well....uh....normal. There are no bells and whistles...just relative peace. Often you don’t even notice the change until someone brings it to your attention. That's what happened with Susan and her fingernails. EFT subtly, but powerfully, reduced her anxiety to the point where biting her fingernails was no longer necessary. Case history #5 - Fear of spiders Molly became very intense when just thinking about spiders and had nightmares about them 5 nights a week. She got completely over her fear in just two sessions with EFT. In the first session, Adrienne used EFT to reduce Molly's fear to zero while she was just thinking about spiders. Often this is enough and the fear stays at zero even when confronted with a real spider. But to make sure, Adrienne took Molly to a pet store to see a tarantula. Molly, once again, became very fearful and ran crying out of the pet store. This was not the fault of the first round of EFT. Rather, it was an indication that the real spider brought up new aspects of the fear that weren't present when just the thought was going on. After a few more minutes with EFT, Molly went back into the pet store and calmly viewed the tarantula. The fear was gone. A few days later Molly called Adrienne to report that she was at a girl friend's house who owned a pet tarantula (it had been surgically rendered harmless)."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"38 She said they took the spider out of the cage and Molly let it crawl on her. Here is a classic example of the power of these techniques. Even people without a noticeable fear of spiders would not let a tarantula crawl on them...even if it was no longer dangerous. But Molly was perfectly relaxed about it and had less fear than the normal everyday citizen. Please note, however, that EFT does not make people stupid. Molly would not have let the spider crawl on her if it was, indeed, dangerous. EFT removes the irrational portion of phobic fears but does not reduce normal caution. Months later, we spoke with Molly and the fear still had not returned. In addition, she no longer had nightmares about them . Case history #6 - Coffee addiction Joe quit drinking coffee. He attended one of my workshops and observed me applying EFT to someone else who wanted to get over their cravings for coffee. He tapped along with us, although he did it in the background, and his coffee cravings went away....permanently. That was the last cup of coffee he had. EFT, in this case broke the addiction in one application. Just so you know...that doesn't usually happen. EFT is a marvelous tool for getting over immediate cravings and is t hus a major help in relieving withdrawal symptoms. But it usually requires many repeated applications before the addiction disappears. About 5% of the people have Joe's response. The rest take longer. Along these same lines, however, Susan, a psychotherapist, got over an addiction to soft drinks in one two minute session and Robb did the same thing for chocolate. Case history #7 - Alcoholism Aaron got over his addiction to alcohol. This, of course, is a much more serious addiction than coffee, soft drinks or chocolate. He went to bed drunk every night and spent his days with a hangover. In his words, \"Alcohol was my God. \" We needed several sessions with EFT and he performed the routines several times per day. As a result, withdrawal was easy. In the early stages of his recovery, he walked by his formerly favorite beer at the supermarket with a sense of pride. And now, one year later, he finds it repulsive. He has no cravings for alcohol whatsoever. He has his life back. He even passed up a New Year's Eve party because he \"didn't want to be around a bunch of drunks.\" Here's a note of common sense. Once an addiction is broken, that doesn't mean you can't become re- addicted. Once you get by your addiction to alcohol, or anything else, stay away from it or you will need to break the addiction again. EFT does not allow you to \"have a little now and then\" of your addictive substance. Case history #8 - Grief Alicia carried such grief over the death of her brother that, even after 2 years, she still couldn't speak about it. Her emotions were too intense to get the words out. I was asked to give a workshop at a convention she was attending and was allowed to apply these techniques to a handful of volunteers the night before the presentation. Alicia volunteered and we worked on her grief in a 15 minute session that included 7 other people. The next morning, midway through the workshop, she voluntarily stood up in front of 80 people and expressed her amazement that she could talk calmly about her brother's death. It still wasn't her favorite subject....but the grief was gone. By the way, everyone in that small group made progress during the 15 minute session. One lady got over a height phobia (she tested it several minutes later by looking over a high hotel balcony....no problem), one man got over anger at a past situation and the others got noticeable relief over a variety of emotional issues. Case history #9 - Fear of needles Connie was very anxious around needles. She would become nauseous and would often faint when it was necessary to have her blood taken. This was limiting, indeed, if she was to have regular physical examinations and maintain good health. Adrienne applied EFT to her for just a few minutes. The fear went away and her next exposure to needles was without any fear whatsoever. "},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"39 This is typical, especially with phobic responses like this. Usually just a few minutes with the techniques creates a lasting result. This is true even if the object of the phobia (needles in this case) is not present at the time. In those few times where the actual situation still brings on some of the fear it usually only takes another round or so of EFT to eliminate it permanently. Case history #10 - Addi ction to \"peanut M&M's.\" Nancy was facing surgery and her doctor advised her to lose weight so that the surgery would go more smoothly. Part of her challenge in losing weight was passing up \"peanut M&M's.\" She had been addicted to them for years. She used EFT to reduce her immediate cravings and, to her surprise, had the experience of totally severing the addiction in about 3 minutes. This \"bonus result\" happens now and then. After that, Nancy had no difficulty walking by \"peanut M&M's.\" Addictions are linked to, and caused by, various forms of anxiety. If you address the anxiety, which is done so powerfully with EFT, then the need for the addictive substance subsides. Case history #11 - Physical pain Lea attended one of the workshops I did for hypnotherapy students. She told me before the workshop that she had a lot of tight muscles and physical pain. I walked her through EFT for relief of the pain around her neck and shoulders. It subsided within two minutes. About an hour into the 3 hour workshop, I asked her if the pain in her neck and shoulders had come back. She said no and then said that the rest of the pain in her body had subsided but was not gone completely. Here's another example of how we address one problem with EFT and other healings occur along the way. In Lea's case, the relief we gave to her neck and shoulder pain spilled over to the rest of her body. We then did another round of EFT and the balance of the pain went away....and it stayed that way for the rest of the workshop. Pain like this is often caused by emotional distress and that's why EFT can be so effective in addressing it. However, new emotional stresses may bring the pain back. If so, repeated uses of EFT will likely give relief. Case history #12 - Low back pain Donna is another example along these lines. She, too, attended one of my workshops and had such severe lower back pain that she didn't think she could stay for the entire one day workshop. \"I just can't sit that long,\" she said. I helped her with EFT and her back did not bother her for the entire day. Case history #13 - Guilt and insomnia Audrey is a severely disturbed woman whom I met with at the request of her therapist. She had been abused physically, mentally and sexually all her life and had a long list of emotional problems that were a challenge to any therapist. I only met with Audrey for 45 minutes. In that time I learned that she carried great guilt over the burning down of her house. It seems she fell asleep one night with a candle going. Her cat subsequently knocked over the candle which, in turn, started the fire. While it may seem obvious that guilt is not in order here, that was not the case with Audrey. She couldn't speak about it without tears. She blamed herself for the entire episode. I walked her through EFT and her guilt appeared to go away. To test it, I let about 20 minutes go by while changing the subject to other things. Then I asked her to tell me the story about her house burning down. To the surprise of her therapist she said, matter of factly, “ It wasn’t my fault” and went on to another subject. No tears. No emotional intensity. The guilt had simply disappeared....in minutes. I tell you this to illustrate a point. EFT can be so powerful that the changes often feel very normal. Accordingly, you may not \"feel any different\" when using EFT for certain problems (like guilt). But listen to what you say about it over time. You will tend to dismiss the problem and it will cease to occupy any of your emotional space. It will vanish without any fanfare. That is powerful, indeed, and is precisely what you want. It is the ultimate in emotional freedom. Audrey also had a problem with insomnia . She slept very little...maybe two hours per night...and had to take drugs to do that. At the end of our session, I had her lay down on a table in her therapist's office and applied EFT to her for sleeping. Within 60 seconds she was sound asleep. I stayed to speak with the therapist for another 30 minutes and, at the end of that time, Audrey was snoring loudly. She was \"gone.\" No drugs, no pills, nothing but tapping on a badly disrupted energy system. Case history #14 - Constipation Richard had been constipated for 25 years. He was taking Metamucil twice a day and still had difficulty \"being regular.\""},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"40 I taught him EFT for this problem and he performed the routine diligently several times per day. After two weeks, there was no noticeable improvement. I told him to be persistent and keep at it. Sometimes these things take more time. I spoke with him two mont hs later and things had improved materially. He was now taking Metamucil only twice a week instead of twice a day. As a student of EFT you must understand that sometimes persistence is important. Emotional problems are often disposed of rapidly and the same is true of many physical problems. However, some situations just take longer and it isn't easy to predict which ones they are. If Richard had given up after two weeks he would not have made this headway. The message?....hang in there. Case history #15 - Body embarrassment Adrienne and I met Bingo at a workshop we gave in Los Angeles. He was a body builder and had shaped himself so magnificently that fitness magazines frequently offered him several thousand dollars to pose for photographs. But Bingo often turned down these offers because he had intense emotional discomfort about revealing his body in public. He was of Asian descent and explained that, in his family, showing off his body was a shameful thing to do. He came up on stage to try to get beyond this problem and became very nervous right away. In fact he said, \"If you make me take off my shirt, I'll kill you.\" Of course he didn't mean it literally but it was certainly an indication of how strong his emotions were about it. After 3 or 4 minutes with EFT, he smiled and calmly took off his shirt to an enthusiastic applause from the audience. A day or two later he accepted an offer to pose for a magazine for $3,000. However, I don't think he got totally beyond his problem. He made some obvious progress but when he took his shirt off he held it in his hands as though he might like to put it back on. He didn't just throw it aside. Chances are, he needed a few more rounds of EFT to get rid of the problem completely. But please remember, this was done under the most adverse circumstances possible....on stage. To make as much headway as we did, which I judge to be about 70%, is remarkable given the setting. Case history #16 - Lupus Carolyn was my first major surprise at how well these techniques can work with physical problems. She attended one of my one day seminars during my early years with EFT. I only spent an hour hitting the highlights of how it worked and helped a few people get over their height phobias (including Carolyn) and their immediate craving for chocolate. What I didn't know was that Carolyn had lupus, a serious degenerative disease. I was simply too busy dealing with many people at once to notice that her hands and feet were swollen from the disease. In fact, she told me later that she couldn't wear normal shoes because of the swelling. During the seminar I taught a shortened version of what you are learning in this course. Carolyn decided to tap several times per day for her lupus condition and, to her surprise, her symptoms all subsided. She came to another presentation of mine two months later and told me what had happened. The only thing she did differently was EFT. She showed me her hands and feet and reported that the swelling had gone completely away. She also said that her energy level had risen to a point where she went dancing frequently. This is something she couldn't do before. So....does this mean EFT will cure lupus? I'm not saying that, although it is very hard to ignore what happened. It obviously helped with her symptoms. I offer this stunning example as evidence of the power of EFT and encourage you to apply it even for serious diseases. But please, please do so with the supervision of your physician. As a follow up, I called Carolyn several months later to see how her lupus was going. She had stopped doing her daily tapping and the symptoms began to reappear. Sometimes physical problems go away completely with no more tapping and sometimes not. This is a case of sometimes not. What is important to recognize here is what did happen...not what didn't. Serious symptoms definitely subsided while balancing the energy system. That is not to be ignored. Case history #17 - Ulcerative colitis Here's another case with a serious disease. Dorothy had ulcerative colitis and was taking heavy medication that had many negative side effects. Ulcerative colitis is a painful disease of the colon and, in Dorothy's case, it was severe. When her doctors inspected it they reported, using lay terms, that it was \"90% infected.\" She worked with Adrienne and did two things: (1) she became a vegetarian and (2) she began using EFT"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"41 daily for her disease. She began to feel much better within a few weeks and chose to slack off on her medication. (Note: we never advise anyone to discontinue medication without consulting with their physician.) About 6 months later, her doctors examined it again and reported it as \"10% infected.\" That was 3 years ago and she has had little or no trouble with it since. In fact, a year ago she gave birth to a child. Now what do you suppose caused her disease to subside? Was it the vegetarian diet....or EFT....or both? There is no way to tell for sure. People often try several healing methods simultaneously and so it is hard to say which contributed the most. Once you have more experience with EFT you may conclude, as I have, that it should always be included as one of the healing techniques. Case history #18 - Panic attack Kerry called Adrienne from a Lake Tahoe hotel in the midst of a panic attack. If you are familiar with panic attacks, you know of the overpowering terror they bring on. People who are in the midst of a panic attack often think they are going to die. Such was the case with Kerry. She called Adrienne with obvious panic in her voice and immediately gave her room number in case anyone needed to come and find her. Adrienne walked her through EFT over the phone and got her over the serious part of her panic within a few minutes. By contrast, sufferers of this condition often endure this intense fear for several hours. To take the edge off within minutes is a welcome relief indeed. In Kerry's case, another 20 minutes was required to bring it way down. Case history #19 - Fear of elevators Ellen used EFT to eliminate her fear of elevators. She approached me during a break in one of my seminars and asked me if I could help her with this lifelong fear. She was understandably timid and cautious about her request as are most people who suffer from intense fears like this. Conventional psychology often requires phobics to confront their fear head on. The fear laden person is typically asked to grit their teeth, clench their fist and get on that elevator. In this way, the logic goes, the fearful person becomes \"desensitized\" or \"gets used to\" the f ear. To me that's a well meant, but unnecessary, practice that, compared to EFT creates unjustifiable pain. It often serves to scare people out of their socks and gives them yet another fearful trauma to overcome. Such practices are no longer necessary. Since EFT is about as pain free as these things get, I told Ellen that we wouldn't go near an elevator until she felt totally comfortable about it. So we stayed in the seminar room and spent 3 or 4 minutes applying EFT. She then said that she had never been so relaxed about elevators before and was ready to go on one. Fortunately, we were in a hotel and were about 30 steps from an elevator. Normally, as a caution, I would have stopped Ellen before going on the elevator and repeated the tapping procedures. In this case, I didn't get a chance because she quickly entered an open elevator and began pushing the buttons with an obvious sense of glee. I got in with her just as the doors were closing and we spent the next 10 minutes in that elevator. We went up, down, stopped, resumed, opened the doors, closed the doors and tested her fear in every way we could. She was totally relaxed....no fear whatsoever...not even a trace. Her lifelong fear vanished. Once again I had the privilege of handing someone the keys to emotional freedom....just like I did for our Vietnam veterans and in the other case histories you have been exposed to in this course. You are on your way to gaining the same ability. To expand your understand ing of EFT, this course includes still more case histories on the videos and audios. An important description of those Part I items follows.... "},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"42 The Video Recordings on DVD For Part I (For easy reference, all EFT videos a re also summarized in the Appendix) Important Note to those downloading this manual for free from the internet: This Manual refers to videos and audios (below) that are included in the much more comprehensive EFT Course. Those videos and audios are available at https://www.emofree.com/eftstore However, this manual provides all the basics. The videos and audios are not unnecessary unless you want to expand your skills beyond beginner status. Also: If you haven’t already done so, please subscribe to our free EFT Insights Newsletter at http://www.emofree.com/subscribe.asp Note: Originally, there were 3 videotapes in Part I. Subsequently, the videos were put on DVDs (which dramatically lowered the cost). This necessitated breaking up the somewhat lengthy videotapes 1 and 2 into Videos 1a, 1b, 2a and 2b. It was not necessary to break up video 3. It is on a single DVD. Video 1a In this video Adrienne a nd I augment this manual by visually showing you each tapping point and how to perform each step of The Basic Recipe. We assume in this segment that you have already read the manual. It is vitally important that you follow along with Adrienne and me and review this segment until you have memorized the whole one minute process. Once memorized, it is yours forever. Video 1b This is a complete demonstration of the entire Basic Recipe with a delightfu l gentleman named Dave, wherein we help him overcome a lifelong intense fear of water. Study this episode. Watch it several times. It is an excellent instructi onal session because it illustrates the handling of aspects so well. Video 2a This video contains the highlights of a live workshop where the theory behind EFT is explained and then EFT ia applied to two groups of people on stage. One group is dealing with fears and the other with pain . Video 2b In this video we show you more case histories of EFT in action. Here are highlights of what you will see: **Larry: He overcomes intense claustrophobia while undergoing what would normally be his most tension filled circumstance....riding in the back seat of a small car in the busy traffic of San Francisco. **Pam: A chocoholic no longer wants her chocolate. **Becci: Her fear of rats makes her hands sweat at the mere thought of one. She ends up having a live rat lick her fingers and says, “I don’t believe I’m doing this. I am doing this.” **Stephen: A 6 year old boy is taught these techniques by his father and quits biting his fingernails . **Adam: This is my son who uses EFT to knock 14 strokes off of his golf score . **Cheryl: She shows up at one of our workshops and describes how she used EFT with me for the fear of public speaking . Our original session was performed over a year ago and she has not had the fear since. **Jackie: She had an accident 10 years ago which left her unable to raise her arm any more than a few inches without having intense pain in her shoulder . In a few minutes on stage she gets complete relief from the problem and can lift her arm at will without pain. This session shows our conversation after the workshop where we discuss this “miracle.” **Cindy: Like Jackie above, Cindy had an accident 3 years ago and has not been able to lift her arm without pain . She has seen numerous physicians and therapists without any material result. In a few minutes with EFT, she lifts her arm as high as she can with no pain whatsoever. **Veronica: Starts with a heavy desire for a cigarette and then uses EFT to eliminate the craving. She then undergoes strong emotions about being raped by her father . After this one session (which you will watch in its entirety) she gets completely over this traumatic memory. **Norma: She is dyslexic and has always needed to read things 4 or 5 times before she could understand them. She gets over that in minutes and gets a new job that requires her to read out loud to people."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"43 Video 3 This video is entitled “6 Days at the VA” and shows the highlights of our visit to the Veterans Administration in Los Angeles to help the emotionally disabled veterans of the Vietnam war. This puts EFT to the ultimate test because most of these soldiers have been in therapy for over 20 years with little or no progress. You will watch thei r emotional intensity melt away in moments. Nowhere is there a greater testimonial to the power of what you are learning. I mention this touching episode in my “Open Letter” at the start of this manual. Important note Please note that throughout Videos 2a, 2b and 3, Adrienne and I use various shortcuts that we have learned over the years. With our extensive training we know when to shorten the process and we always do so in the interest of efficiency. Remember, we are usually dealing with skeptical strangers and are often doing so under the most difficult of circumstances....on stage. Accordingly, we use shortcuts (described in Part II of this course) whenever possible and rarely do the entire Basic Recipe. Rest assured, however, that if we had taken the time to perform the more thorough process you are learning in Part I of this course, we would have achieved the same results. It would have taken a few seconds longer per round...that's all. The main purpose of these sessions is to give you a head start in the direction of experience by showing you how these techniques work in the real world...with real people...over a wide variety of problems. They take you out of the classroom and show you how these techniques are administered and how people respond. Also, in some cases, some of the tapping has been edited out so that the session \"moves along\" on film. This allows the wider experience to come through without being burdened by the constant repetition of the procedures you have learned elsewhere in this course. I am not teaching The Basic Recipe here on videos 2a, 2b and #3. That is done rather thoroughly in the earlier parts of this manual and on vide o 1. Videos 2a, 2b and 3 are all about experience. The Audio Recordings on DVD For Part I Here's what's in them To further widen your experience with EFT, I have included several hours of case histories on the audios. As in the videos, you won't be just listening to theory. These are real people with real problems. You will hear some people get over lifelong problems in moments while others require persistence. You will hear Adrienne and me apply EFT to some severe emotional problems and listen to them disappear right on the audio. You will also hear some partial relief for ailments that doesn't go away completely. In short, these audios add to your rainbow of experience, thereby giving you a useful background that you can use when applying EFT. Read these points before you listen to them. **These audios contain a series of telephone sessions conducted by my business associate, Adrienne Fowlie, and me. They are a collection of authentic sessions recorded with a desktop tape recorder. While the sound quality is certainly adequate, the recordings were obviously not made in the pristine atmosphere of a recording studio. **Some of these sessions are with people who are actually undergoing EFT. As you listen in, you will literally be a first hand “observer” as people apply these techniques to a wide variety of emotional and physical problems . This will give you an invaluable “feel” for what you can expect when you apply EFT to yourself and others. **Other sessions are with people who have used EFT in the past and are telling about their experiences since then. This gives you a good sense of the lasting nature of these techniques. **The purpose of these audios is to expand your experience of these techniques. It is not to teach the tapping processes themselves. That is done by the manual and Video 1a. Thus, as in videos 2a, 2b and 3, I have edited out much of the tapping so you can focus on people’s responses and the other details involved in the techniques. **You will be listening in on some highly personal problems and you will be doing so with the permission of those involved. They did it so others (like you) could benefit from"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"44 these marvelous techniques. We owe them all a thank you. **Repetition is very important in learning. Accordingly, you will hear me repeat some important points, from different angles, many times during these audios. This is not to bore you. It is to embed important concepts into your thinking. **These sessions are for your education and not your entertainment (although some of them are very entertaining). I could have made them short and snappy...editing them to make a couple of quick points each time...and then moved on. Doing so would rob you of some of the “feel” and “depth” to these processes. On the other hand, some conversations get off the subject and delve into areas outside the interest of this course. In editing these audios for your education, I have drawn a blend between these two extremes always erring on the side of including as much useful information as I can. **Please note that the tapping you do hear on these audios will seem different than what you are being taught. It is not, in fact, different. It is simply shorter and takes a somewhat different form. As I mentioned in the section on the videos, Adrienne and I are advanced practitioners of these techniques and have been doing them for many years. Accordingly, we use some of the same short cuts previously mentioned. But there's another technique that is used in the audios. Adrienne and I have invested the time and money to learn Dr. Roger Callahan’s Voice Technology in an effort to better assess the tapping points, existence of Psychological Reversal, etc. We used this form of diagnosis on these audios to save time but are, at all times, using the same tapping points that you are learning. When I first learned Voice Technology I thought it was a major aid in applying these procedures. After years of experience, however, I no longer believe it adds any extra value and have discontinued using it. I have developed a more useful diagnostic technique which is taught in great detail in our video set “Steps Toward Becoming The Ultimate Therapist.” Those interested in this advanced training should consult those videos. As previously stated, diagnosis is beyond the scope of this course. The Basic Recipe (using the 100% overhaul concept) is being taught instead because it is an adequate substitute for the vast majority of cases. It takes a few seconds longer per round to perform and you may need to do a few more rounds (persistence) to get the same results. In any event, we are talking extra seconds or minutes here (per problem)...not weeks or months. Notice in these audios not only what people say but also the differences in their voices before and after using EFT. Also notice that many times people emit a very relaxed “sigh” after tapping. This evidences the release of emotional burdens. On a few of the audios you will hear a “thump, thump, thump” in the background. This is the result of a malfunction in my tape recorder and is not someone’s heart beating. You may be tempted to look at the \"Session by Session Summary\" below and go right to “your issue” on the audios. That’s human nature, I suppose, but please don’t ignore the rest of these audios just because they don’t seem to apply to you for the moment. They contain valuable insights that will magnify your abilities with EFT. Session by session summary 1. Barbara through Paulette Barbara (7 min 35 sec): Relief from a traumatic memory (hitting a windshield), a headache and insomnia . Del (9 min 56 sec): He stands on a rooftop with a cellular phone and overcomes a lifelong, very severe, height phobia . The phobia is eliminated so completely that he goes skydiving. Neck and joint pains also subside. Mike (3 min 28 sec): With graduate degrees in psychology, he finds this process astonishing. He gets over love pain (breaking up with his lady friend) very rapidly....but finds it hard to believe. "},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"45 Ingrid (9 min 23 sec): She has had nearly constant irritable bowel syndrome , headaches , \"burning eyes,\" and constipation for many years. She gets substantial relief from all of them and becomes quite humorous about her constipation toward the end of this session. Paulette (4 min 40 sec): Lifetime fear of flying disappears. After EFT she takes two flights with no anxiety at all. 2. Buz through Bruce Buz (9 min 10 sec): A sufferer of a severe case of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) . Listen as he tells his most intense war memory as though it was a shopping trip. Donna (1 min 35 sec): She uses EFT to help with her vision . Kieve (9 min 45 sec): Pay particular attention to this one. Kieve learned these techniques just as you are learning them and applied them to 150 people with astonishing results. He tells of just some of the people he has helped with phobias , PMS , migraine headaches , hip pain , corn pain and other problems. Master these techniques and you can do the same. Cathy (7 min 23 sec): This lady suffered from daily back pain since an automobile accident 24 years ago and has been through every imaginable method for relief...with no real help. She tells how it completely subsided after using these tapping techniques. She also dramatically improved her daily anxiety and insomnia . Bruce (11 min 22 sec): He has had multiple sclerosis for 7 years and gets noticeable resurgence of strength in his legs . He is confined to a wheelchair and stands up during the session. He gets feelings back in his hands and feet and reduces back pain and a sleeping disorder . 3. Geri through Bonnie Geri (10 min 15 sec): This professional psychotherapist had a major fear of dentists . As it turns out, she had more fears than she thought.

What follows is the advanced portion of EFT. Here we get behind the inner workings of EFT Part I and expand our skills with this unique technique. In this section we will... Explore the impediments that sometimes inhibit EFT and learn what to do about them. Take The Basic Recipe apart and learn some shortcuts for faster results. Thoroughly expose you to the art of EFT through countless video demonstrations on a wide variety of issues. There is much to be gained in these advanced areas and it is every bit as fascinating as what you have learned so far. But before going further I want to make sure that I have established a vital perspective regarding EFT Pa rt I. Namely...The Basic Recipe is an extraordinarily powerful device even without the advanced details ...and... ...if you will persistently apply The Basic Recipe while being \"tuned in\" to your problem, there is a good likelihood that the problem will fade away. Although the advanced concepts are importan t for you to know, persistence with The Basic Recipe will often do the j ob. The Basic Recipe is a gi ft and is a condensation of many years of experience. Please keep this ever present in your mind as you expand your knowledge in this section. "},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"48 The Impediments To Perfection Even in the hands of relatively proficient newcomers, The Basic Recipe produces effective results about 80% of the time, particularly when applied to specific negative events in one’s life. This is an extraordinary success ratio and few, if any, conventional techniques can make the same claim. However, an even higher success ratio is possible when you know how to handle the impediments to perfection. There are four such impediments which can hinder the results of The Basic Recipe. They are: 1. Aspects 2. Psychological Reversal 3. Collarbone Breathing Problem 4. Energy Toxins. Impediment #1 Aspects No need to spend much time here on aspects because they have been covered earlier. I include them here under impediments even though they are not actually impediments. They are apparent impediments because they seem to impede progress. Each aspect is simply a new portion of the problem which needs addressing before complete relief is gained. It is handled with The Basic Recipe just as if it is a separate problem (which, in a way, it is). You will see this demonstrated repeatedly in the numerous EFT Part II videos. If none of the other impediments are in the way, persistence will frequently neutralize the aspects. Impediment #2 Psychological Reversal EFT Part I introduced you to The Setup as a label for the more technical phenomenon known as Psychological Reversal (a term coined by Dr. Roger Callahan but originally brought to the public by Dr. John Diamond). This is a fascinating discovery on its own and deserves special treatment in this course. Did you ever wonder why... ....athletes get into slumps? This defies normal logic. There is no physical reason for them to perform so far below par. The athlete is the same highly trained person before, after and during the slump. But all athletes go through this many times in their careers. Why? ....addictions are so hard to overcome? After all, the addict usually wants to be free of their destructive patterns. They know, and will often admit, that their addiction is costing them their health, their relationships and even their life! Yet they continue with it. Why? ....depression is so hard to correct? It is one of the most difficult psychological issues to handle. If one goes for conventional therapy to get over depression they are usually in for years of expensive procedures. And progress, if any is made, is usually accomplished in baby steps. Why? ....we sometimes self-sabotage ourselves? When we try, for example, to lose weight or read faster we often manage to \"stop ourselves\" and fall back into our previous \"comfort zones\" with little or no real progress. Why? ....healing sometimes takes so long? The lingering cold that just won't go away, the sprain or broken bone that takes forever to heal, the headache or pain that stays and stays. Sometimes things just don't heal normally. Why? The reason is in the body's energy system. It is the actual cause of what is commonly called self sabotage. It is the reason why we sometimes seem to be our own worst enemy and don't reach those \"new levels\" we truly want. In addition to the above examples, it is also why people often try in vain to make more money and fall short in countless other pursuits even though they know they have the ability to achieve them. It is also a contributor to psychological blocks (like \"writer's block\") and learning limitations (like dyslexia). Before this discovery, peop le's seeming inability to make progress in areas that are obviously important to them was blamed on such things as \"lack of will power\", \"poor motivation\", \"spacing out\" or other forms of supposed character defects. But this isn't so. There is another cause....and it is correctable."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"49 Psychological Reversal (PR for short) is that cause. It is an immensely important and practical discovery that is finding its way into several disciplines. It is vital in psychology, medicine, addictions, weight loss, and countless fields of endeavor including sports and business performance. Where PR is present, little or no headway will be made. It... literally blocks progress. What is Psychological Reversal? Everyone experiences it. It occurs when the energy system in the body changes polarity and it usually happens outside your awareness. You don't ordinarily \"feel\" it happening. It is a literal polarity reversal in your body's energy system and is like having your \"batteries in backwards\" as explained in EFT Part I. Interestingly, it often takes the form of what psychologists call “secondary gain or loss.” For example, the person who consciously believes that they want to lost weight will often have an unconscious “stopper” such as, “If I lose weight I will only gain it back again and that will cost me a lot of money in changing my wardrobe.” This person is psychologically reversed against losing weight. How was PR discovered? Psychological Reversal has its roots in a field known as Applied Kinesiology. One of the tools of this discipline is known as muscle testing. Here the patient rigidly extends an arm straight out from the side of his or her body while the doctor pushes down on it to assess the patient's strength. The doctor then has a dialogue with the patient and pushes down on the arm as the patient makes statements. If there is a subconscious disagreement with the statement, the muscles go weak and the arm is easily pushed down. Otherwise, the arm remains strong. This allows the doctor to \"talk to the body\" and thus help diagnose where problems might reside. Dr. Roger Callahan was using this procedure with a lady who wanted to lose weight. For perspective, here is how he tells it in his book, \"How Executives Overcome the Fear of Public Speaking and Other Phobias.\" \"There is not a therapist practicing who has not encountered a patient who simply cannot be cured, no matter how effective the therapy ordinarily is or how diligently the patient and therapist apply themselves to the task. This resistance to treatment is a frustration to therapists and a trial to their patients. It has been called by many names, such as: death instinct, the loser syndrome, self-defeating behavior or negativity. These troubled patients are called by many names: recalcitrant patients, negative personalities, self destructive individuals -- but their situation is always much the same, they seem to resist all help -- no matter what approach is used. They claim they want to be cured -- but they do not respond to treatment. While I was working with an overweight woman who professed to want to be thin, I encountered this negative block. She had been dieting with little success for years. Yet, in spite of her failure to cut down on eating, she insisted that she wanted to lose weight. Using the muscle test, I asked her to picture herself thin, the way she said she wished to be. The result startled me. When she succeeded in picturing herself minus her extra weight, her arm tested weak. We were both surprised. Yet, in spite of the negative results, she insisted that she did want to lose weight. So I tried a different approach. I asked her to picture herself 30 pounds heavier than she was. Now she tested strong. I restated the question even more directly. I had her say aloud, 'I want to lose weight.' The test suggested that her statement was not true. Now I had her say, 'I want to gain weight.' This time she tested strong. Obviously, there was a discrepancy between what she said she wanted and what the test indicated she wanted. Curious, I tried this same test on six other clients who had been dieting for months or years without success. They all showed the same pattern. What they said they wanted was the reverse of what they were shown to want when I tested them using the same muscle test. This was, certainly, not the first time I had encountered resistance to treatment. But now I had a tool with which to identify it and possibly overcome it. To have the name of this condition also be a description of it, I called it Psychological Reversal. ....Now I began to test all my other clients with reference to their major problems (ie: 'I want to get over my anxiety attacks,' 'I want to get a better relationship with my wife/husband/lover,' 'I want to overcome my frigidity/impotence/premature ejaculation,' or 'I want to be a successful and/or fine actor/singer/musician/composer,' etc.). In each case, I also had the patient make a reverse statement (ie: 'I do not want to get over my anxiety attacks,' etc.). And each time I tested, using the arm test. I was flabbergasted at the results of these tests. I found to my chagrin that a large number of my clients got weak when they thought of getting better and stronger when they thought of getting worse. No wonder psychotherapy is so difficult....\" What causes PR? The principle cause is negative thinking. Even the most positive thinkers among us carry around subconscious negative, self defeating thoughts. PR is the usual result. As a general rule, the"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"50 more pervasive this type of thinking, the more prone we are to becoming psychologically reversed. With some people it is an all pervasive phenomenon. It stops them just about everywhere they go. You can usually tell who these people are because nothing ever seems to work for them. They complain a lot and consider themselves a victim of the world. People with this \"across the board\" form of reversal are called massively reversed. PR is also a chronic companion of those who suffer from depression. Depression, negative thinking and PR live in the same house. Please understand, PR is not a character defect. These people, unknowingly, suffer from a chronic reversal of the electrical polarity in their bodies. Their energy systems literally work against them. As a result, they are stymied just about everywhere they go. It is not the world that is against them....it is their own energy system. Their batteries are in backwards. Most people know, at least intuitively, that negative thinking blocks thei r progress. That's why there are so many books and seminars on positive thinking. However, up until now, no one has been able to explain how negative thinking creates these blocks much less provide a way to correct it. Psychological Reversal does both. With most people PR shows up in specific areas. A person may do very well in many areas in their life but giving up cigarettes, for example, seems to be out of their reach. They may consciously want to quit and may want to do so badly. In fact, they may even give the habit up for awhile. But eventually, if they are PR, they will sabotage their own efforts and start smoking again. They aren't weak. They are PR. The energy in our bodies must flow properly if we are to perform up to our potential. Psychological Reversal is one of the important ways in which it becomes interrupted. PR is also correctable and the correction, which is called The Setup in EFT, only takes a few seconds to do. This process is covered in detail as part of The Basic Recipe. PR is possible in any human endeavor. There are literally thousands of possibilities. But just to illustrate, here are a few examples. Some examples of Psychological Reversal Learning difficulties. Writer's block and most learning difficulties are often a direct result of PR. A student, for instance, can do well in all subjects except one (like chemistry) and the odds are high that PR is behind the poor subject. Students don't know they are psychologically reversed because, until now, they didn't even know the phenomenon existed. But they do tend to give reasons for their \"inadequacy.\" They may say, \"I' m just not cut out for chemistry,\" or \"I can't seem to concentrate on it,\" or \"I hate it.\" These reasons are usually inaccurate. The real reason is usually PR. When they think about their poor subject, their polarity reverses and performance suffers accordingly. Correct the PR and the grades will usually improve. Some students are PR about school in general. This is a major contributor to poor grades and it often goes unaddressed. The students are considered \"slow\" or \"learning disabled.\" What a label to carry through life unnecessarily! Health. PR is almost always present with degenerative diseases such as cancer, AIDS, multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, lupus, arthritis, diabetes, etc. From an EFT point of view, it is one of the main impediments to healing. In time, I suspect western medical disciplines will recognize this fact and integrate PR into their other techniques. Unreversing oneself (aiming The Setup at a particular ailment) appears to allow the body's natural healing processes to work more fluidly. This makes sense when you consider the importance of the proper flow of energy throughout the body. Broken bones seem to heal more quickly when your \"batteries are installed properly\" and physical ailments of many kinds make greater progress. Physicians, acupuncturists, chiropractors and other health practitioners whose patients are making unsatisfactory progress might wish to teach their patients to unreverse themselves. It may release more healing force and speed up the recovery. Athletics. It's a good bet that people are PR whenever they are stymied in some area of progress in their life. Athletes are prime examples of this. The great basketball player who is lousy on the free throw line is almost certainly PR about shooting free throws. Correcting for the reversal will likely bring about a dramatic improvement. The same goes for field goal kickers, high jumpers, baseball hitters and athletes of all types. Owners and"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"51 coaches of professional sports teams could make stunning use of this easy concept. Dyslexia. If you think about it, dyslexia is a classic example of reversal. In fact, reversal is its major symptom. Among other things, people transpose numbers and letters and thus have difficulty learning. Annie approached me after one of my seminars and asked me if I could help her with the dyslexia she had lived with since childhood. She was 49 years old. She told me she couldn't write down telephone numbers accurately. \"I get the first 3 numbers right\", she said, \"but I mess up the last 4.\" I then recited 10 telephone numbers to her and asked her to write them down. Sure enough. All 10 were wrong. I helped her correct her PR and then recited 10 more phone numbers. This time she got 9 of them perfect ....and it was effortless. I don't want to leave the wrong impression. We may not have totally eliminated her dyslexia. What happened was that we got her Psychological Reversal temporarily out of the way and, with it gone, she performed normally. That is a stunning example of the power of PR. In the case of dyslexia, the PR will likely reappear in time and with it will come the dysfunction. Annie has more to do. But without an understanding of PR, her progress will most likely be very slow if, indeed, there is any progress at all. PR blocks progress. Of particular importance with EFT is that... when PR is present the tapping procedure won't work. Remember, PR literally blocks progress and that is just as true with EFT as it is with any other technique. I have many friends who are psychotherapists and they all have numerous clients that just don't respond to even the best of techniques. Until they learned of Psychological Reversal, this blockage was a mystery to them. After years of experience with EFT we now know how often PR shows up. PR is present in about 40% of the issues that people address with EFT. In some issues, however, PR is almost always blocking progress. Depression, addictions and degenerative diseases are the main examples. For most issues, however, PR may or may not be present in a given individual. One person may be PR for relieving asthma, for example, and another may not. How will you know if you are experiencing PR? You won't. That's why The Basic Recipe includes an automatic correction for it (The Setup). It only takes seconds to perform and does no harm to correct it even if it isn't there. So, unless PR is corrected, your success ratio with these methods will suffer dramatically. That's why the correction for PR is built into The Basic Recipe. Impediment #3 Collarbone Breathing Problem In a few cases...maybe 5%...a unique form of energy disorganization occurs within the body that impedes the progress of The Basic Recipe. It's details are well beyond the scope of this course but I can show you how to correct it. I call it the Collarbone Breathing Problem not because there is something wrong with one's collarbones or one's breathing. Rather, it is named after its correction...the Collarbone Breathing Exercise. This correction was developed by Dr. Callahan and need only be \"thrown in\" in cases where persistence with The Basic Recipe is not showing results. It takes about 2 minutes to perform and may clear the way for the normal operation of an otherwise impeded Basic Recipe. Although I describe it verbally below, you are advised to consult the videos for EFT Part II for a live demonstration. Collarbone Breathing Exercise While you can start with either hand, I'm going to assume you are starting with the right one. Keep your elbows and arms away from your body so that the only things touching are your fingertips and knuckles as described. Place two fingers of your right hand on your right Collarbone Point. With two fingers of your left hand, tap the Gamut Point continuously while you perform the following 5 breathing exercises: **Breathe all the way in and hold it for 7 taps. **Breathe half way out and hold it for 7 taps. **Breathe all the way out and hold it for 7 taps. **Breathe in half way and hold it for 7 taps. **Breathe normally for 7 taps. Place the two fingers of your right hand on your left Collarbone Point and, while continuously tapping the Gamut Point, do the 5 breathing exercises. Bend the fingers of your right hand so that the second joint or \"knuckles\" are prominent. Then place them on your right Collarbone Point and tap the Gamut Point continuously while doing the 5 breathing exercises. Repeat this by placing the right knuckles on the left Collarbone Point. You are now half way done. You complete the Collarbone Breathing Exercise by repeating the entire procedure using the fingertips and knuckles of the left"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"52 hand. You will be tapping the Gamut Point, of course, with the fingertips of the right hand. How do you use the Collarbone Breathing Exercise? First, assume you don't need it and proceed as normal with The Basic Recipe. This is a logical assumption because this problem doesn't impede EFT for very many people. But if you have used The Basic Recipe persistently and your results are either slow or non existent then start each round of The Basic Recipe with the Collarbone Breathing Exercise. You may find that it \"clears the way\" and allows dramatic relief. Impediment #4 Energy Toxins We live in a sewer I opened a new bar of soap this morning and read the label. It has 8 chemicals in it I never heard of. They all get on my body when I shower. My shaving cream has 7 such ingredients and my hand lotion has 13. These go on my body too. My toothpaste didn't show any ingredients but I'm sure it has several chemicals that no doctor would advise me to eat. Yet they seep into my system through the sensitive membranes in my mouth. Then there is my underarm deodorant that has 9 foreign chemicals in it. And, if I was a woman, I would be subject to numerous cosmetics. Eyeliner and lipstick to name but two. I wonder how many noxious chemicals find their way into our bodies through such things as facial creams, hair spray, cologne, perfume, shampoo and hair conditioner. It has to be an intimidating list and, so far... we haven't even left the bathroom. The water that comes out of our faucets contains another list of toxic substan ces. Yet we bathe in it, cook in it and make our morning coffee with it. Chemical residues from the laundry soap in which we wash our clothes come in contact with our bodies all day long. We sleep between sheets that have these same residues. There are chemical air fresheners and deodorants in our homes and offices that smell nice, but do so at the expense of filling our air with foreign substances. We eat rancid popcorn at movie theaters that is loaded with salt. We drink \"soft drinks\" that are nothing more than chemical cocktails. We consume massive amounts of refined sugar. Our foods are laden with a list of dyes, preservatives and pesticides that would compete in size with a small telephone book. We ingest alcohol, nicotine, aspirin, antihistamines and countless drugs. We breathe fumes from our cars, industrial smokestacks and the insulation in our homes. In short, we face an army of chemical intruders 24 hours a day. Like I said, we live in a sewer. A different kind of \"allergy\" Our bodies are designed to ward off the effects of toxins and, all things considered, they do an admirable job. But enough is enough! Sooner or later, this onslaught shows up in our health. Allergies are among the most common reactions we have to all these toxic substances. Sores, rashes, and a host of sinus problems are but some of the allergic symptoms from which we suffer. Allergies are commonly thought to be chemically caused. That is, these toxins cause chemical reactions in our bodies which are, in turn, responsible for our irritating symptoms. An energy system \"allergy.\" But there is a different kind of allergy that needs to be introduced here. It doesn't necessarily irritate our internal chemistry and so it doesn't fit the classic definition of an allergy. Rather, it is like an allergy in that it irritates our energy system. For lack of a better term, we call them “energy toxins.” Ways to avoid energy toxins If you have repeatedly tried EFT with little or no success AND you have exhaustively addressed all the aspects of the issue AND you have applied EFT to the specific events that may be underlying the problem, then a possible culprit is some form of energy toxin that is irritating your energy system and thus competing with these procedures. It is not because EFT doesn't work. On the contrary, it works marvelously given the proper environment. There are several ways to avoid the effects of energy toxins even if you don’t know what specific toxin may be effecting you. I list these ways below: Energy toxin avoidance method #1 -- Move from where you are. Sometimes there is something in your immediate environment that is causing the problem. It could be an electronic device like a computer or TV or it may be fumes from a plant, your carpet or your ventilation system. Perhaps you have some sensitivity"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"53 to the chair in which you are sitting or maybe the room you are occupying has been newly painted. So....just the physical act of moving can remove you from some offending item. You might want to stand up and go elsewhere in the room. If that fails go to another room or go outdoors. Since EFT takes so little time to perform, you can move to several different places and try it out. If you find success by moving, then rest assured you have removed yourself from some toxin to your energy system. If you still have no luck then use.... Energy toxin avoidance method #2 -- Remove your clothing and take a thorough bath or shower without soap . The clothes we wear have chemicals on them that may interfere with our energy system. The fabrics themselves may cause sensitivity as may the various chemicals with which they are manufactured. The chemicals used by laundries and dry cleaners as well as the residue from your laundry soap can also irritate your energy system. You may have residues on your body from numerous other substances. Perfume, shaving cream, soap, cosmetics, hair spray, shampoo, conditioner, etc. My experience has shown that sometimes even a very minute amount of a toxic substance is enough to cause a problem. Please remember that a substance that is toxic to your energy system may not be toxic to someone else's. Energy toxins have very individualized effects. So, in case any of these things is interfering with your progress you will need to take a bath or shower and scrub vigorously with a soap free washrag. Make sure you include sensitive areas such as underarms and the genitalia. Be diligent around areas where you may have applied perfume or cosmetics. Rinse your hair thoroughly. Don't use soap or shampoo in the process as it can leave a residue of its own. Doing these things will usually remove the chemicals on your body. Then start fresh with EFT. But this time....do it in the buff. I know that sounds a little odd but this will often do the job. This way all chemicals are off your body and you minimize the chance of th em interfering with your energy system. Make sure you stand up so that you avoid contact with chairs or beds or other possible offending substances. You w ill be barefoot, of course, and it would be best if you stood on a hardwood floor or a board or a piece of plastic. This way you avoid your carpet and any chemicals that may be on it. If the above procedure results in success with EFT, then an energy toxin was likely in your way. However, if you make no headway despite this effort then use.... Energy toxin avoidance method #3 -- Wait a day or two. If methods #1 and #2 don't allow you the result you are looking for then, chances are, the energy toxins aren't on you. They are probably in you. This means that the toxins were ingested. You either ate or drank them. If you wait a day or two, you allow the ingested toxins to be eliminated. And, once eliminated, they are not around to compete with these techniques. If the ingested toxin is something you consume consistently, however, your system will, at best, have only small windows of time within which EFT can be successfully administered. If, for example, coffee is an energy toxin to you, then your everyday consumption minimizes the opportunity for EFT to work. It is forced to compete with an ev er present enemy within. We are often addicted to the things we consume consistently and thus gi ving them up presents a problem. EFT provides a valuable aid for those who want to get beyond their addictive cravings. This is covered elsewhere in this course. This brings us to an interesting point. Energy toxins are not always things that are commonly known to be bad for you. French fries, for example, fail to make the \"healthy foods list\" of just about every nutritionist in the country. But that doesn't mean that they interfere with your energy system. On the contrary, I often find that french fries are not in the way of these techniques. That still doesn't make them advisable to eat, of course. On the other hand, otherwise healthy foods can be very bothersome to your energy system. As a general rule, things you consume a lot of will tend to be energy toxins to you. This is true even for the healthiest of foods....even lettuce. Lettuce, like all other plants, develop their own internal toxins to ward off predators. It is a natural form of self preservation. We ingest these toxins, of course, whenever we eat the host plant. Normally, our bodies handle these toxins with ease. But if we eat a lot of lettuce then we begin to overload our systems with these \"lettuce toxins.\" These excess toxins then become bothersome to the body and, in particular, can irritate the body's energy system. This goes for potatoes, peas, plums and any other food that we eat. In short, foods we overdo become candidates to be energy toxins. It would be advisable to"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"54 cut back on their consumption. While virtually anything could be toxic to your energy system, there are some items that show up with some frequency They may or may not be toxins to you but they are common. I list them below: Perfume Refined Sugar Alcohol Herbs Coffee  Nicotine Wheat Tea Dairy Corn  Caffeine  Pepper  And how will you know which foods may be irritating your energy system enough to inhibit The Basic Recipe from working? You won't. But if you will eliminate all of the above substances from your diet for a week the chances are excellent that The Basic Recipe will start working its wonders. If that doesn't do it then ask yourself intuitively what it might be. Your intuition is often accurate. Everyone experiences toxins but that doesn't mean they will interfere with these techniques. On the contrary, most people are not bothered enough by the energy toxins to infringe on these marvelous procedures. On the other hand we must also be mindful that some ailments are caused by allergens or other forms of pollution. This is just common sense. Nonetheless, we are often able to relieve the symptom even though its cause is from the environment. In fact, we can sometimes collapse the allergic reaction itself by using EFT. For example... Even though I am sensitive to wheat... Even though I am allergic to my cat... Even though my soap causes a skin rash... And so on. I’ve seen many cases where allergic reactions completely disappear with the use of EFT. This is not always the case but it is certainly worth a try. Let me also mention that, in some cases, simply removing a given substance from someone’s diet or environment can provide dramatic healing results. For example, one friend of mine had bouts of depression for many years. She took prozac and all the drugs and had no real relief...only temporary masking of the problem. She eventually discovered that she was sensitive to wheat and, upon eliminating wheat from her diet, the depression lifted entirely. No pills, no EFT, or anything else. Just the cessation of wheat in her diet. The Value of Persistence I started EFT Part II with the following reminder... ...if you will persistently apply The Basic Recipe while being \"tuned in\" to your problem, there is a good likelihood that the problem will fade away. Persistence, by itself, can serve to sidestep the effects of many of these impediments. With persistence you will be performing The Basic Recipe at different times of the day...indoors and outdoors...at the office...in the home...while wearing different clothes...and while enjoying different diets. This means your toxic environment will be constantly shifting and you are likely to find one or more time windows where energy toxins (assuming they represent a problem for you) are not in your way. Also, the Collarbone Breathing Problem is not consistently present. It comes and goes and persistence will probably find a time window for you where the Collarbone Breathing Exercise is not necessary (assuming it was necessary in the first place). And with persistence you are repeatedly performing The Setup and addressing Aspects thereby routinely handling most problems presented by these phenomena. My point here is that... persistence pays. Diligently and persistently apply The Basic Recipe to whatever problem interests you and you will likely raise your success ratio without having to dwell on the technicalities of these impediments. Your success ratio will be even higher if you apply EFT to all the specific events in your life that may contribute to whatever problem you are addressing."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"55 Shortcuts Since The Basic Recipe only takes one minute to perform you might wonder why I would introduce the idea of short cuts. After all, how much shorter than one minute do you need to get? Although it is possible to skip this section altogether and still be very effective w ith EFT, delving into short cuts gives you two advantages: 1. You can deepen your understanding of The Basic Recipe because most of the shortcuts involve taking the process apart and detailing the individual pieces. 2. Therapists, physicians and other people helpers will appreciate the time efficiencies involved. You can often get by with a 15 or 20 second version of The Basic Recipe and that time saving really adds up if you are dealing with many patients. Let's start by revisiting The Basic Recipe. It takes the form... The Setup Sequence 9 Gamut Sequence If we can eliminate any of these steps or make them shorter then, obviously, we gain some time efficiency. Shortening The Sequence The Sequence is the workhorse in The Basic Recipe. It is the main contributor to knocking down those emotional bowling pins after The Setup has done its job. But while we can't eliminate it, we can usually shorten it. As it turns out, the energy meridians that circulate through the body are all interconnected and, through experience, it appears that tapping on one meridian will often affect another. Thus, through trial and error, I have found that tapping on fewer meridians will usually do the job. I start with EB (beginning of the E ye B row) and stop with UA (under the A rm). Continuing on by tapping on the points of the fi ngers and hand is usually not necessary. You will see me do this repeatedly on the videos. I rarely do the entire Sequence. For clarity, the short cut version of the Sequence looks as follows: EB = Beginning of the E ye B row SE = S ide of the E ye UE = U nder the E ye UN = U nder the N ose Ch = Ch in CB = Beginning of the C ollar B one UA = U nder the A rm Eliminating The Setup Please recall that Psychological Reversal is almost always present in depression, addictions and degenerative diseases and thus The Setup, in these instances, is almost always necessary to perform. But in other cases, PR only appears about 40% of the time. This leaves an obvious 60% where The Setup isn't necessary. Do we dare eliminate it and risk failure on the 40% where PR is present? Sure. There is a way to do it. However, I usually include The Setup routinely because it only takes a few seconds to do. But if I choose to omit The Setup there is a procedure that allows me to know quickly if I need to go back and do it. I start with the Sequence (the short cut version which only takes 10 seconds) and then stop and assess if any progress is made. I ask the person if their intensity has dropped from the original number of, let's say, an 8. If they say yes then I know The Setup wasn't necessary and I continue on with The Basic Recipe. How do I know The Setup wasn't necessary? Simple. I know that PR blocks progress dead in its tracks...and...since progress was made in this example, PR could not have been there. If, on the other hand, no progress was made whatsoever, then I must suspect that PR was in place and start The Basic Recipe over again...this time starting with The Setup. With experience, you will find that some people have little or no PR to deal with. It's a delight to discover this because you can usually zip right through their issues with incredible speed. Eliminating The 9 Gamut Procedure The 9 Gamut Procedure is not always necessary either. In fact, it is only needed about 30% of the time. It too, can sometimes be eliminated. I often eliminate it simply because 70% of the time it is useless. If I'm not making the progress I would like, I can always put it back in. If it was necessary, progress should resume. The Floor to Ceiling Eye Roll This is a useful short cut when you have brought the intensity of the problem down to a low level...like a 1 or 2 on a 0 to 10 scale. It only takes 6 seconds to perform and, when successful, will take you to zero without having to do another round of The Basic Recipe."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"56 To perform it, simply tap the Gamut point continuously (while holding your head steady) and take 6 seconds to slowly move your eyes from hard down to the floor to hard up to the ceiling. Repeat the reminder phrase while you do it. This process is demonstrated for you on the videos. Adrienne shows you how to do it in the shortcut section of the first video in the Part II video series. The Art of Doing Short Cuts Because there is some art involved, it is difficult to put down on paper how these short cuts are to be used in real situations. That is one reason I have included numerous video demonstrations with this course. You will watch me use these short cuts in numerous situations and can then get a feel for how to proceed. Experience is the best teac her when it comes to using short cuts. This section simply acquaints you with the fundamentals. Please remember, however, that The Basic Recipe only takes one minute to perform. You don’t really need to do the shortcuts. They are faster and more convenient, that’s all. The Video Recordings on DVD For Part II (For easy reference, all EFT videos and audios (on DVD) are also summar ized in the Appendix) Important Note to those downloading this manual for free from the internet: This Manual refers to videos and audios that (below) that are included in the much more comprehensive EFT Course. Those videos and audios are available at https://www.emofree.com/eftstore However, this manual provides all the basics. The videos and audios are not unnecessary unless you want to expand your skills beyond beginner status. Also: If you haven’t already done so, please subscribe to our free EFT Insights Newsletter at http://www.emofree.com/subscribe.asp Video 1 - Overview This video is a bridge between Part I and Part II wherein Part I is recapped and many of the new concepts included in the Part II manual are reviewed. Here we discuss the impediments to perfection, shortcuts and the forest and trees metaphor. Video 2 - Audience Examples The rest of these videos contain a condensed combination of two 3 day seminars. This video starts at the beginning of those seminars and explores a wide variety of issues...both emotional and physical...and lends an invaluable perspective to the far reaching power of EFT. It discusses issues such as the fear of public speaking, agoraphobia, anxiety, migraine headaches, physical pain, fear of flying, depression, fibromyalgia and high blood pressure. There is also a discussion from the stage of The Discovery Statement and some important demonstrations of Psychological Reversal. These latter demonstrations are critically important for you to study. Video 3 - Emotional Issues I There are three sessions on this video. The first is with Jason who works with anger and betrayal as a result of his wife leaving him and issuing a restraining order that prohibited him from seeing his daughter. The second session is with Veronica. You will recognize her as the lady who used EFT for being raped by her father in the second video in Part I. She appears here, 3 or 4 months later, and still has no emotional problems with that specific issue. This is incontrovertible evidence of the power of EFT under even the most intense of issues. On this video, she works on an entirely different issue. She has obviously intense emotions about being abandoned , alone and not being loved as a small child. Our session with EFT eliminates the problem and she comes back the next day to report that she feels \"light as a feather.\" The third session is with Sandhya who works through her emotions regarding the experiences her father had during the World War II Holocaust. Video 4 - Emotional Issues II There are two sessions on this video. In the first session, Marlys uses EFT to get over \" love pain \"...an obsession over the loss of romantic relationships. As this EFT session unfolds, several aspects show up and the issues shift in a daisy chai n fashion. It eventually evolves into the fact that her mother didn't love her and, after using EFT, she laughs about it. In the second session, Kathy has three issues: (1) a fear of being touched (hugged), (2) a traumatic incident where her mother threw boiling water on"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"57 her and (3) a sore shoulder which is related to her having to fend off beatings. She responds beautifully to EFT and The Setup (Psychological Reversal) is not necessary even though numerous rounds of EFT are performed. Video 5 - Physical Issues There are four sessions on this video. First, Connie J. has tightness in her jaw that comes from clenching her teeth at night. The clenching is so severe that she has to wear a bite plate at night to protect her teeth. With EFT, she achieves complete freedom from this problem in minutes even though it has been with her for 2 or 3 years. She also had a headache which she eliminated on her own using EFT. Second, Patricia came on stage with an episode of asthma from which she had suffered for over 10 years. She gets dramatic relief with EFT and reports that it is still gone the next morning. She also experiences major relief from a back problem even though she has herniated discs. Dorothy came on stage with an irregular heartbeat which is an ailment for which EFT had never been used. Since we try it on everything , we applied EFT to it with excellent results. Connie M. uses EFT for her neck pain which, according to her, came about because of emotional issues. She gets complete relief. Video 6 - Addictive Cravings This session starts with two ladies who run an eating disorder clinic. The concepts in this conversation lead into the causes behind all addictive behaviors, including eating disorders. Then follows (1) an important discussion of the causes of addictions and (2) an entire session where EFT is used on a group of people to overcome the immediate cravings for chocolate, cigarettes and alcohol . Video 7 - Energy Toxins, Phobias & Persistence This important video emphasizes the effect of energy toxins and the value of persistence when using EFT. The first part is an interview with Todd who gets nowhere during the seminar because energy toxins are in his way. He then comes back, a month later, to tell the members of another seminar about the dramatic effect a change in his diet had been on his sleep disorder , eye pain and depression . Next is an unusual session where several people experience improvement on their snake phobias . However, even though the improvements are dramatic by conventional standards, they are considered slow and relatively ineffective by EFT standards. This is due to suspected energy toxins within the room. Persistence is required to generate relief for most of these people. Finally, we show the value of persistence in a session with Grace who was beset with intense depression and many other issues. We make little headway on stage but her persistence and attention to her diet in the following weeks creates major improvement in her emotional well being. She tells of this enthusiastically in a phone conversation. Video 8 - Common Problems and Q&A This is a catch-all video that explains EFT's use in such areas as sports (golf), business , public speaking, procrastination, self image and relationships. It also entertains numerous common questions from the audience to round out your understanding."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"58  Appendix Articles written by Gary Craig on... Using EFT on Fears and Phobias Using EFT on Traumatic Memories Using EFT for Addictions Using EFT for Physical Healing Using EFT to Enhance Your Self Image Summary of the EFT Vide os and Audios on DVD "},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"59 Using EFT on Fears and Phobias About 10% of the population suffers from one or more phobias. They can cause intense fear and often severely limit the lives of those who have them. There are hundreds of possible phobias and EFT can be effective on all of them. I include below some of the more common ones: Public speaking Heights Snakes, spiders and insects Claustrophobia Dentists Needles Driving Elevators Flying Bridges Rejection Sex Water Speed The telephone Marriage Men Failure Disease Dogs Computers Bees Being alone What is a phobia? For our purposes, a phobia is any \"excess fear\" over and above normal caution or concern. Let me explain.... Our fears are essential...to a point. They are important to our survival. Without them we might walk off the tops of tall buildings, eat arsenic or play tennis on the freeway. They are automatic mechanisms that kick into place when danger is afoot. They step on the brakes for us and keep us from harm. But sometimes fears overdo their function. They go well beyond the normal boundaries of caution and create an unnecessary fear response. It is one thing, for example, to be cautious when you see a snake or a spider. Some of them are dangerous and could cause you harm. But it is quite another thing to experience a pounding heart, headache, nausea, vomiting, sweat, tears or a long list of other excessive fear symptoms. These latter responses are useless in that they contribute no more to your safety than does normal caution. They are \"excess fear\" and serve only to create misery for the phobic person. It is that \"excess fear\"....the useless part....the part that is above and beyond normal caution or concern...that we define as a phobia. What is fascinating about EFT in this regard is that it eliminates the phobic part of the fear but leaves the normal caution or concern alone. People are often amazed at how quickly a lifelong phobia vanishes. But the process doesn't make them stupid. They don't suddenly jump off of tall buildings or kiss grizzly bears. What is interesting, though, is that people who eliminate a phobia with EFT tend to have less fear than the general public with regard to that phobic circumstance. Almost everyone, for example, has some phobic response to heights. Ask 100 people to look down from the top of a tall building and most of them will feel a little queasy. That's a phobic response, of course, but for most people it is rather mild. It doesn't cause them any real problem in their day to day living. By contrast, those who completely eliminate a height phobia with EFT don't even feel queasy. They are left only with normal caution and could spend the day calmly looking off that building. It doesn't matter how intense the phobia is or how long you have had it either. That's a big surprise to many people because conventional wisdom has told us for decades that long standing, intense phobias are \"deeply ingrained\" and must take months or years to eliminate. Not so with EFT. Some phobias take longer to resolve than others but that’s not because of their intensity or longevity. Rather it is because of their complexity, i.e. the number of aspects involved. If a phobia is being “stubborn” with EFT, try using EFT on the specific events that may underlie the fear. Examples might be.... **Even though that snake bit me when I was 8.... **Even though I fell off the school roof in the 4 th grade... **Even though the class laughed at me when I forgot the words to my speech..... And so on. With that in mind let's apply what you learned in the earlier parts of this manual. Please recall the discovery statement upon which EFT is built: "},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"60 \"The cause of all negative emotions is a disruption in the body's energy system.\" All phobic responses are negative emotions and are thus caused by a \"zzzzzt\" in your energy system. That means the solution to your problem is conceptually very easy. Just eliminate the \"zzzzzt\" and the phobia will fade to zero. No headaches. No pounding heart. No problems whatsoever. The emotional intensity will be neutralized. Our tool for this is The Basic Recipe. A few trips through it should eliminate the problem forever. How many trips you need, however, depends on how many aspects there are to the phobia. Aspects are important. Aspects, as discussed earlier, are different parts of the phobia that contribute to your emotional intensity. Let's revisit the height phobia example for clarification on this idea. Most height phobics have had many specific events in their lives where they were up high and their phobic responses left them with distressing memories. For example, one gentleman I helped with a height phobia had a fearful memory (aspect) of sitting on a water tower when a little boy. There was no way to get down and it scared him to death. Memories like this are separate aspects of a height phobia if, when separately recalled, they produce a fear response. Since most phobias only need one aspect addressed, just 1 to 3 brief trips through The Basic Recipe will usually do the job. You will be rid of the problem in a matter of minutes and, in most cases, it will never return. At this point, neither you nor I know how many aspects of your phobia need to be addressed. That notwithstanding, we can still proceed very effectively. All we have to do is assume you have several aspects that need addressing and address them, one by one until you have no more emotional intensity. When your emotional intensity has vanished you will know that you are done and all relevant aspects have been addressed. Questions and Answers Q. Once the phobia is eliminated, is the result permanent? Yes. However, if it appears to “come back” that is almost always because there are new aspects that weren’t properly addressed the first time. If you quiz the client on what is going on with them you will usually hear them speak about the fear differently. For example, the snake phobic might discuss his/her adverse reaction to the moving tongue of a snake. If this aspect didn’t come up while using EFT, then it remains a problem. Using EFT on the moving tongue should eliminate that aspect and provide complete relief from the phobia unless, of course, there is yet another unaddressed aspect. In other cases, a brand new traumatic experience could start the phobia all over again. In this case, you need only repeat the process again as if it was a brand new phobia (which it is). Relief should be moments away. Q. What do I do if I have several phobias? Address them one at a time. For example, make sure your spider phobia is totally neutralized before you address your claustrophobia. Then make sure your claustrophobia is totally neutralized before you address your driving phobia, etc. Some phobias are labeled complex in that they are several phobias wrapped into one. The fear of flying is sometimes like that because it can also involve (1) claustrophobia, (2) the fear of falling, (3) the fear of dying, (4) the fear of turbulence, (5) the fear of taking off, (6) the fear of landing, (6) the fear of people, etc. If you can isolate them in your mind, they qualify as different aspects and should be addressed separately. If you have a complex phobia, but are unaware of it, persistent use of The Basi c Recipe should still do the job. But it may take many trips through the process until all \"zzzzzt's\" are neutralized. The intensity may rise and fall as the different aspects are handled \"behind the scenes.\" Using EFT on Traumatic Memories (Including War, Accidents, Rape, Post Trauma tic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and all past abuses.) This section is in stark contrast to all conventional approaches. In it we lump a nearly endless list of emotional problems into one category (traumatic memories) and handle them all as if they were identical. In fact, they are identical because they all have the same cause...a disruption in the body's energy system. Traumatic memories generate a wide variety of emotional reactions when people recall them. Some become very intense. They get headaches or stomach aches. Their hearts pound. They sweat. They cry. They may have sexual dysfunction, nightmares, grief, anger, depression and any num ber of other emotional and physical problems."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"61 Let's begin by applying what you learned earlier. Please recall the discovery statement upon which EFT is built: \"The cause of all negative emotions is a disruption in the body's energy system.\" Thus every negative emotion you have regarding a traumatic memory is caused by a \"zzzzzt\" in your energy system. That means the solution to your problem is conceptually very easy. Just eliminate the \"zzzzzt\" and the emotional impact will fade to zero. No more nightmares. No more headaches. No more pounding heart. No more problems whatsoever. You will still have the memory, of course. But that is all. The emotional charge will be neutralized. Our tool for this, of course, is The Basic Recipe. A few trips through it should give relief. How many trips you need, however, depends on how many aspects there are to the memory. Aspects are important. Aspects, as you recall, are different parts of the memory that contribute to your emotional intensity. Most traumatic memories have only one main aspect. Thus 1 to 3 brief trips through The Basic Recipe will usually suffice. You will be rid of the problem in a matter of minutes and, in most cases, it will never return. Some traumatic memories, though, have several aspects. They require more time because more trips through The Basic Recipe are needed. But even if extra trips are necessary, we are usually only talking minutes here. Maybe 20 or 30 minutes instead of 5 or 6. What we need, obviously, is a way to locate these aspects. Once located, it is a simple matter to address them one by one until every aspect of the memory has been neutralized. We can do this rather efficiently by using the \"short movie in your mind\" concept. A short movie in your mind. Consider a traumatic memory as a short movie that runs in the theater of your mind. There is a beginning. There are main characters and events. And there is an end. Usually, the \"movie\" plays in a flash and ends in a familiar unwanted emotion. Because the movie plays so fast, we are unaware that it may have different aspects that are contributing to the negative emotion. It seems to come from the movie as a whole. If we could run the movie in slow motion, the different aspects could be located and then addressed. So that is what we do. We run the movie in slow motion. Narrate the movie. The best way to do that is to narrate the movie OUT LOUD. Tell it to a friend, or a mirror or a tape recorder. And, most importantly, tell it in detail. This automatically slows the movie down because words are much slower than thoughts. As you tell it in detail, each aspect will make itself known to you. Stop as soon as you feel any intensity (remember, we minimize pain here) and perform The Basic Recipe on it as though it was a separate traumatic memory. Actually, it is a separate traumatic memory. It just got lost within a larger movie. Then continue through the aspects, bringing each to zero, until you can tell the whole story with no negative emotional impact whatsoever. As stated, most traumatic memories only have one aspect. Others have 2 or 3. Rarely is there more than 3 but it could happen. If so, be persistent. Relief is not far away. Questions and Answers Q. What do I do if I have several traumatic memories? Address them one at a time. Take your most intense memory first and bring it to zero before going on to the next one. Follow this pattern until all of your traumatic memories are neutralized. In the process of putting your traumatic memories \"in the bag\" you will likely feel a freedom that may border on euphoria. It is an incredible gift to unload useless baggage like this. Some people (like war veterans) have hundreds of traumatic memories. If you are among them, you can expect the generalization effect to work for you. For example, if you have one hundred traumatic memories, you probably only need to address 10 or 15 of them. After that, you are likely to have difficulty getting any emotional intensity over the remaining ones. The generalization effect will have neutralized them. Q. Doesn't the rapid elimination of emotional problems \"rob\" someone of the importance of exploring the problem in depth and \"getting to the bottom of it?\" Conventional methods presume that the cause for these \"deep set\" emotional problems resides in some recess of the mind which must somehow be discovered and unraveled. To do otherwise is to \"cheat\" the client and leave the problem unresolved. EFT ignores this idea totally. I have helped hundreds of people with traumatic memories...some of them extrao rdinarily intense. After using EFT, not one pers on....ever....has shown any interest in exploring it further or \"getting to the bottom of it.\" To them, it is completely resolved and they are gratefully relieved of its burden. In my experience, EFT does get to the bottom of the issue and does so very powerfully. People's attitudes change almost instantly about the memory. They talk about it differently. Their words shift from fear to understanding. Their demeanor and posture evidence a"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"62 dramatically shifted disposition about the memory. They don't even bring it up any more because it has been put in perspective. All this happens when EFT removes the offending \"zzzzzt\" from the energy system. That's because the \"zzzzzt\" is the true cause."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"63 Using EFT for Addictions (Rethinking the cause of addictions) Addictions are a mystery to most professionals. Addicted people come to them for help and want....really want....to be free of their addiction. But despite their good intentions and despite spending a great deal of time and money, they usually revert to their former behavior. And even when someone kicks one addiction they somehow manage to pick up another in its place. Most people who give up cigarettes, for example, usually gain weight because they substitute food for cigarettes. Likewise, people who get beyond alcohol often revert to heavy uses of cigarettes and coffee. In these cases the addiction is not overcome....it is merely shifted. The reason for the poor performance of most addiction treatments is that they do not address the true cause!!! If they did, people w ould not need to substitute one addiction for another. So what is the true cause of addictive behavior? Let's start by listing what it is not. It is not what conventional methods have tr ied to make it for many decades. For example: It is not a bad habit. It is not inherited. It is not because it runs in the family. It is not because the addict is weak. It is not a lack of will power. It is not because the addict has a \"secondary gain.\" In my experience, these \"causes\" are put forth because they seem to be expl anations for this unwanted behavior. There seems to be some logic in them and that, of course, is why they are pursued. However, they all have one thing in common...a poor record for relieving someone of their addiction. What is needed here is the true cause....not a list of seem-to-be's. The true cause of all addictions is anxiety....an uneasy feeling that is temporarily masked, or tranquilized, by some substance or behavior. To many, this is a refreshing \"Aha\" because it unveils a cause they didn't know how to articulate. Inwardly they have always known that their need to smoke, drink, overeat, etc. is propelled by their need to tranquilize a level of uneasiness. But they didn't directly link that feeling with the true cause of their addiction. If you think about it, this link becomes obvious. For example: Addicts often refer to their addictions as nervous (anxious) habits and, Addicts accelerate their use when under increased stress (anxiety). Take away an addict's substance (tranquilizer) and they will get very fidgety (anxious). In fact, they will often become anxious at the mere threat of taking the substance away. Listen to addicts when they talk about their addiction and you will often hear them say, \"It relaxes me.\" This is the most obvious clue of all. Why would they need to relax unless they were feeling some form of anxiety? What else would they need to relax from? Let's examine this further by looking at the false idea that addictions are just \"bad habits.\" While there may be some habitual behavior involved, addictions are more than just bad habits . This is evident because habits, by themselves, are very easy to break. Here is an example. I have the habit in the morning of putting on my right shoe before my left one. If I wanted to change that habit it would be very easy to do. I would simply put a note by my shoes that reminded me to put my left shoe on first. After a few repetitions of this process, my habit would change and the note would no longer be necessary. Changing a pure habit like this is easy because there is no anxiety involved. But this same method would fail miserably if it were applied to the \"habit\" of cigarette smoking. Merely placing notes around to remind one not to smoke is a useless exercise. Those notes are powerless in the face of someone with an anxiety driven craving. When addicts have cravings they seek out a favorite substance (cigarettes, alcohol, etc.) to tranquilize their anxiety. They do so, of course, in an effort to relax, calm their nerves, take their mind off of things, take a break, etc. All of these reflect different forms of anxiety which are driving them toward the addictive substance or behavior. So addictive behavior is not simply a bad habit. It is an anxiety driven need that begs for relief. The real problem for the addict here is that their substance or behavior only relieves their anxiety temporarily. It merely masks the problem for awhile. That's why it is a tranquilizer. When the effect of the tranquilizer wears off, the anxiety surfaces once again."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"64 This is clearly so. Otherwise, one use of the addictive substance or behavior would permanently relieve the problem. As is well known, this never happens. Instead addicts must repeat their behavior for relief. They then grow dependent and end up associating anxiety with their tranquilizer. This becomes, of course, a vicious circle in which they become trapped. Often, their anxiety beco mes even more intense when they are deprived of their tranquilizer. This increases their withdrawal symptoms and builds a barrier against giving up their addiction. The pain of withdrawal becomes too great a price to pay. They much prefer the risks of their addiction. The withdrawal problem This brings me to an attractive feature of EFT. It dramatically reduces the pain of withdrawal and often eliminates it entirely. This is but one of many features that sets EFT apart from all other methods. Withdrawal consists of both physical and emotional factors. When people discontinue an addictive substance, the physical need for it usually leaves within 3 days. This is a natural process wherin the body rids itself of unwanted toxins. But the emotional factor (anxiety) tends to persist for weeks or months and sometimes it never leaves. In my experience, anxiety is the biggest part of withdrawal. This is obvious when you apply EFT because the anxiety usually subsides to zero in a matter of moments. And as the anxiety leaves, so do most of the withdrawal symptoms. Let's turn now to the solution. We will begin by applying what you learned in the earlier parts of this manual. Please recall the discovery statement upon which EFT is built: \"The cause of all negative emotions is a disruption in the body's energy system.\" Since anxiety is a negative emotion, it follows that it is caused by a disruption in the body's energy system. And that, of course, is easily addressed with The Basic Recipe. Eliminate the \"zzzzzt\" and you eliminate the craving. It's almost as simple as that. I say almost because, to be complete, I must discuss another important barrier in your way....Psychological Reversal. To emphasize its importance, I devoted an entire section to PR in an earlier part of this manual. I urge you now to read it again because it applies in a major way to addictions. Please remember that PR is the cause of self sabotage. It is the reason people thwart their own efforts and behave in a manner contrary to their own best interests. All addicts know their addictive behavior is heading them in the wrong direction. Many try repeatedly to overcome it and, even if they make progress, they eventually defeat themselves by slipping back into their previous behavior. This is a classic example of PR. PR occurs in over 90% of all addictive behaviors. That is why we find it so difficult to put addictions behind us. Our energy systems change polarity and subtly work against our otherwise well meant efforts. That is also why we can eliminate addictive cravings and still find it hard to discontinue our addictive behavior. I know that may seem strange...but it happens consistently. If you have repeatedly failed to put an addiction behind you, I guarantee that PR was a major factor. To be effective, then, we must eliminate both the immediate cravings and the Psychological Reversal. The Basic Recipe will be our tool, of course. It is particularly well suited to the task because it contains The Setup....a built in correction for PR. How to address the addiction This is straightforward. Just aim The Basic Recipe at the addiction and repeat it throughout the day. It will help reduce any anxiety that is driving the addiction as well as correct for any Psychological Reversal. However, we must remember that The Setup does not eliminate PR permanently. PR usually comes back and, in the case of addictions, does so frequently. Thus...and this is important...you will need to perform The Basic Recipe a minimum of 15 times per day. 25 times per day is recommended. This will keep your anxiety (and thus your cravings) at a low level and will continually keep the subtle (but damaging) effects of PR out of your way. In time, the PR should fade and diminish as a problem. The 25 time per day recommendation should be spaced so that the tapping is done throughout the day. To do this you could (1) get a watch that beeps every 1/2 hour to remind you or (2) do it along with habitual daily routines such as... When you get up in the morning. When you go to bed at night. Before each meal. Every time you walk into the bathroom. Every time you get into or out of a car. Every time you hang up the telephone. Every time you sit down. Every time you stand up. Every time you enter or leave your house. Every time you go through a doorway."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"65 Obviously, people have different routines and some of the above may not be practical for you. They are listed to give you the idea of it. Customize your own list for your circumstances. Sometimes you will find yourself in social circumstances (like parties or restaurants) where doing The Basic Recipe may cause others to doubt your sanity. In that case, excuse yourself and go into the bathroom or out to your car or anyplace else convenient. How to address the craving If you follow the above precisely, it is unlikely that you will have much in the way of withdrawal or cravings during the day. But, if you do, you must perform one or more rounds of The Basic Recipe until the craving subsides. This is in addition to the recommended 25 repetitions for the addiction. Addressing specific events that cause your anxiety While the above routine, if followed diligently, should assist you in breaking an addiction, I must also, in the interest of thoroughness, urge you to address the specific events underlying the anxieties that addictive behaviors strive to tranquilize. Seemingly, this can be a daunting process because most people are not aware of the specific events that directly contribute to the addictive behavior. So, without that awareness, how can they apply EFT? Also, depending on the person, there may be an endless list of such specific events. Fortunately, there is a solution to this that I placed on the EFT web site. It is called The Personal Peace Procedure. It’s value here is to systematically collapse every specific event in your life that causes anxiety, addictions, or limits of any kind. Here, for your review, is a copy of The Personal Peace Procedure. The Personal Peace Procedure Hi Everyone, The Personal Peace Procedure that I'm about to unfold for you is not just a way to \"feel a little more peaceful.\" Properly understood, this technique should be the healing centerpiece for every person on earth. Every physician, therapist, spiritual counselor and personal performance coach in the world should be using it as a leading tool for helping others (and themselves). In essence, the Personal Peace Procedure involves making a list of every bothersome SPECIFIC EVENT in one's life and systematically EFT'ing their impacts out of existence. By diligently doing this we can pull out every negative tree from our emotional forests and thus eliminate major causes of our emotional and physical ailments. This, of course, propels each individual toward personal peace whic h, in turn, contributes mightily toward world peace. Here are some uses.... 1. As \"homework\" between sessions with a physician or therapist. This is certain to accelerate and deepen the healing process. 2. As a daily procedure to clear out a lifetime of accumulated emotional debris. This will enhance self-image, reduce self-doubt and provide a profound sense of freedom. 3. As a means to eliminate a major contributor (if not the sole cause) of a serious disease. Somewhere within one's specific events are those angers, fears and traumas that are manifesting as disease. By addressing them all, you will likely cover those responsible for the disease. 4. As a useful substitute for finding core issues. If you neutralize all the specific issues you will have automatically included core issues. 5. As a means for consistent relaxation. 6. To become an example to others as to what is possible. This simple concept should shift the entire healing field. I can state it in a sentence... MOST OF OUR EMOTIONAL AND PHYSICAL PROBLEMS ARE CAUSED (OR CONTRIBUTED TO) BY OUR UNRESOLVED SPECIFIC EVENTS, THE VAST MAJORITY OF WHICH CAN BE EASILY HANDLED BY EFT. "},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"66 Not bad for a mere engineer, eh? That sentence, if adopted by every healing practitioner and patient, would likely (1) dr amatically increase our healing rates while (2) precipitously dropping our costs. Please note that this idea completely ignores chemical causes such as those propounded by the medical model. That's because I have repeatedly seen improvements in clients where drugs and other chemical solutions have failed miserably. This is not to say, however, that drugs, proper nutrition and the like don't have their place. Indeed they do. They can often be vital. In my experience, however, our unresolved specific events are nearer the foundational cause for illness than anything else. Thus they deserve our primary attention.. How obvious! Experienced EFT'ers are well aware of EFT's ability to cleanly wipe the negative specific events off of our mental walls. This is the area wherein our highest success ratios appear. To date, however, we have focused our efforts on those negative specific even ts that underlie a given ailment such as a phobia, headache or traumatic incident. This is good...very good...and we should continue doing so. On the other hand, why not use EFT on ALL the other specific events that are behind our more gene ralized (but VERY important) issues such as (to name a few).... Self-image Anxiety Depression Persistent insomnia Addictions Compulsions Feelings of abandonment As you eliminate the emotional baggage from your specific events you will, of course, have less and less internal conflict for your system to deal with. Less internal conflict translates into a higher level of personal peace and less emotional and physical suffering. For many, this procedure will likely result in the comple te cessation of lifelong issues that other methods have not touched. How's that for peace in a paragraph? The same applies to physic al ailments as well. I'm talking here about everything from headaches, breathing difficulties and digestive disorders to AIDS, MS and Cancer. It is becoming more widely accepted that our physical maladies are caused (or contributed to) by unresol ved angers, traumas, guilt, grief and the like. I have had many discussions with physicians in recent years and more and more of them echo emotional strife as a major cause of serious diseases. Until now, however, there hasn't been an effective way to eliminate these health bandits. We can mask them with drugs, of course, but true cures have been hard to find. Fortunately, EFT and its many cousins now provide easy and elegant tools that will aid the serious health practitioner in killing the root causes of disease...instead of the patient. What I share here is NOT a substitute for quality EFT training NOR is it a substitute for quality help from a masterful EFT practitioner. Rather, it is a tool that, properly applied, is capable of wide ranging relief (qua lity training or quality assistance will add to its effectiveness). Its simplicity and far reaching effectiveness give it candidacy as a mandatory method for anyone seeking help for even the most difficult of problems. I know that's a bold statement but I've been at this for over a de cade now and have seen so many impressive results ove r such a wide variety of issues that this statemen t is easy, if not essential, to make. The method here is simple (I'm assuming you already know how to apply EFT)..... 1. Make a list of every bothersome specific event you can remember. If you don't find at least 50 you are either going at this half-heartedly or you have been living on some other planet. Many people will find hundreds. 2. While making your list you may find that some events don't seem to cause you any current discomfort. That's OK. List them anyway. The mere fact that you remember them suggests a need for resolution. 3. Give each specific event a title....as though it was a mini-movie. Examples: Dad hit me in the kitchen--I stole Suzie's sa ndwich--I almost slipped"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"67 and fell into the Grand Canyon--My third grade class ridiculed me when I gave that speech--Mom locked me in a closet for 2 days--Mrs. Adams told me I was stupid. 4. When the list is complete, pick out the biggest redwoods in your ne gative forest and apply EFT to each of them until you either laugh about it or \"can't think about it a ny more.\" Be sure to notice any aspects that may come up and consider them separate trees in your ne gative forest. Apply EFT to them accordingly. Be su re to keep after each event until it is resolved. If you cannot get a 0-10 intensity level on a particular movie then as sume you are repressing it and apply 10 full rounds of EFT on it from every angle you can think of. This gives you a high possibility for resolving it. After the big redwoods have been removed, go to the next biggest trees. 5. Do at least one movie (specific event) per day...preferably three...for 3 months. It only takes minutes per day. At this ra te you will have resolved 90 to 270 specific events in 3 months. Then notice how your body feels better. Note, too, how your \"threshold for getting upset\" is much lower. Note how your relationships are better and how many of your therapy type issues just don't seem to be there any more. Revisit some of those specific events and notice how those previously intense incidences have faded into nothingness. Note any improvements in your blood pressure, pulse and breathing ability. I ask you to consciously notice these things because, unless you do, the quality healing you will have undergone will seem so subtle that you may not notice it. You may even dismiss it saying, \"Oh well, it was never much of a problem anyway.\" This happens repeatedly with EFT and thus I bring it to your awareness. 6. If you are taking medications, you may feel the need to discontinue them. Please do so ONLY under a qualified physician’s advice. It is my hope that the Personal Peace Procedure becomes a worldwide routine. A few minutes per day will make a monumental difference in school performance, relationships , health and our quality of life. But these are meaningless words unless others (you) put the idea into practice. Personal Peace to all, Gary What to expect As you apply EFT as directed above, your cravings should be dramatically reduced on the first day and they should get milder and less frequent as the days roll on. Eventually, you should have no cravings whatsoever and any addictive substance involved will actually seem repulsive. You will be free. Your attitudes toward it will change and you will wonder what you ever saw in the addiction in the first place. These are healthy signs, of course. When you reach this point you should continue with the entire daily routine for a few days to \"lock it in.\" Once the addiction is broken, however, you are still not immune from being re -addicted. Avoiding any future temptation is advised. This is true, of course, with any addiction recovery. Questions and Answers Q. How much time will it take to get over my addiction? This varies widely. In my experience, addictions to relatively mild substances like chocolate, coffee, soft drinks and various foods are often gone in a few days. They actually become repulsive to the addict. I just finished helping a lady who overcame addictions to soft drinks, bacon, onion rings, chocolate, gooey type candies, and french fries with one or two trips through The Basic Recipe for each substance. She is no longer tempted by them. Other people take longer, of course. Addictions to stronger substances like cigarettes, alcohol, cocaine, etc. usually take longer....maybe a week or two. I worked with one man who eliminated his several year addiction to alcohol in 3 or 4 trips through The Basic Recipe. This result is not rare but it's also not the kind of thing I can predict for you. There are no hard and fast rules here. It is over when it is over....and you will know when that is because you simply won't want it any more. Withdrawal symptoms should be nominal. "},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"68 Q. Can I address several addictions with the same trip through The Basic Recipe? No....you can only address one addiction at a time. Do not combine two or more addictions into the same trip through The Basic Recipe. Use a separate trip for each addiction. Don't be surprised, however, if diligently pursuing one addiction breaks other addictions along the way. This happens sometimes because the tapping drops one's anxiety in such a manner that nothing is required as a tranquilizer. There's no way to predict this rather delightful phenomenon but it does happen. Q. How does EFT help with weight loss? If you want to lose weight you must address the foundational cause. And that cause is an addiction to food which is driven by anxiety...just like any other addiction. In fact, the number one addictive substance in America is food. It has a way of temporarily masking anxiety in a manner similar to tobacco, alcohol, etc. How many times have you raided the refrigerator when you weren't really hungry? Why did you do it? To mask a feeling of anxiety? You may not have called it anxiety. You may have called it boredom or \"nervous eating\" but it was, nonetheless, a form of anxiety. The anxiety that drives an addiction to food...or any other substance or behavior...can come from many places. It can come from the stress in the family or workplace or it can come from abusive childhood experiences or traumatic memories. To lose weight, obviously, you must eliminate the anxiety that drives the overeating behavior. What better tool to use than EFT? In addition to The Personal Peace Procedure (described above), persistently apply (25 times per day) The Basic Recipe to your overeating behavior so that the underlying anxiety subsides. Use it again to reduce the unnecessary food cravings when they arise ( Even though I crave that pie... ) and, over time, the cause of your food addiction...and thus your overweight condition...should leave."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"69 Using EFT for Physical Healing Nowhere is there more obvious evidence for the existence of the mind-body connection than EFT. By now you have witnessed (and I hope experienced) dramatic physical healing on several levels. Here is a beginning list of the physical ailments which have been addressed by EFT with either partial or complete success: Headaches, back pain, stiff neck and shoulders, joint pains, cancer, chronic fatigue syndrome, lupus, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, asthma, allergies, itching eyes, body sores, rashes, insomnia, constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, eyesight, muscle tightness, bee stings, urination problems, morning sickness, PMS, sexual dysfunctions, sweating, poor coordination, carpal tunnel syndrome, arthritis, numbness in the fingers, stomachaches, toothaches, trembling, multiple sclerosis. There are many, many more. A complete list is several times as long. Try it on everything. I try EFT on every physical ailment presented to me and am repeatedly astonished at the results. I don't have 100% success (who does?) but often EFT will give startling relief where nothing else seems to work. There are thousands of physical ailments that befall human beings for which the healing sciences have developed a wide array of remedies. These remedies range from a laying on of hands to drugs & surgery to fasting to mental imagery. They all seem to show results for some of the people some of the time. But none of them work for all of the people all of the time. EFT, in my experience, works so well that it should be included in every healer's tool bag. And I'll go a step further. I think it should be one of the first tools the healer uses. Here are the reasons: The relief from symptoms is usually immediate. It often works where nothing else will. It is easy to apply. It takes very little time. It is not habit forming. I don't know any other healing technique that can make all these claims. Do you? Nonetheless, EFT does not replace medicine or any other healing practice. It is best to work with other healing practitioners. That EFT deserves a prominent place in the physical healing hall of fame is undeniable. Even the most casual observer must greet the results with great respect. But the obvious question is...why does it work? Why, if its original design is to address emotional issues, does the identical pr ocess work so remarkably well on physical problems? There are many mysteries surrounding the healing sciences and that is why research in this field is an unending process. EFT is no exception. Just as the proper flow of blood throughout the body is vital to one's physical health, so is the proper flow of the body's energy. Thus, balancing it with EFT is bound to promote physical healing. It is undeniable that negative emotions contribute to physical ailments. To the extent that EFT neutralizes those negative emotions, the physical symptoms appear to subside. Questions and Answers Q. How long will it take to get relief? There is no hard and fast rule on this. Symptoms often fade away in a matter of minutes although, occasionally, there is a delayed reaction for a few hours. Relief from the underlying disease could take days, weeks or months. So....be persistent. And be su re to consult with your physician. Many people are tempted to discontinue medication as healing takes place. This should only be done with the guidance of your physician. Q. Can I address several symptoms at a time? No! Use The Basic Recipe on each symptom independently. Start with the most severe symptom and work down. Don't be surprised, however, if working with one symptom generates relief for the others. This happens frequently. Q. Can I really expect results from EFT for long standing, severe diseases? I am quite aware that conventional wisdom suggests that many long lasting diseases are permanent fixtures in one's health profile. Accordingly, to suggest that they can be measurably reduced or eliminated by methodically tapping on the energy system is radical indeed. It is outside the beliefs of almost everyone I have met. But I have seen, first hand, many startling examples of this and am remiss if I don't report them to you. Q. How often should I apply The Basic Recipe to my problem? For symptoms such as headaches, pain,"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"70 upset stomach, etc....perform The Basic Recipe whenever you want relief. For the underlying disease, it should be done 10 times per day until you are satisfied with the results. The 10 daily trips through The Basic Recipe should be spread throughout the day. A good way to do this is to develop the habit of doing them by linking them to your own habitual routines...such as: When you get up in the morning. When you go to bed at night. Just before each meal. Every time you use the bathroom. It is also important to apply EFT to every specific event that may be causing the physical ailment. Applying The Personal Peace Procedure will help as well. Q. Will you please discuss some of your experiences with various physical ailments? Sure. But please remember that the examples listed below represent a tiny portion of the possible ailments which EFT can address. Back pain I know many people who have significant damage to their backs and the reasons fo r their pains are evident in their X-Rays. Nonetheless, after a few minutes of EFT their pains faded dramatically. This doesn't appear to make sense until you recognize that stress shows up in the muscles which, in turn, exert abnormal strains on our joints. Relaxing the muscle tension, through EFT, thus reduces unnecessary stress on the joints. The result is less pain. I have lost count of how many back pains I have seen subside. Some pains vanish completely and never come back while others require a daily tapping routine to keep the pain away. Headaches and stomachaches I estimate that at least 90% of the cases I have witnessed regarding these symptoms have responded very well. Most of them faded away completely within a few minutes of using The Basic Recipe. Carpal tunnel syndrome I had a business dinner one evening with Anne, whose carpal tunnel wrist pain was at a 7. After less than 2 minutes into The Basic Recipe, the pain disappeared altogether and didn't come back for the rest of our meeting. Needless to say, she was astonished since nothing else had ever given her relief. Our paths have not crossed since then, so I don't know how long it lasted. This is the type of problem, however, that tends to come back and so additional tapping would likely be necessary. Psoriasis Donna's psoriasis was so bad that she had difficulty wearing shoes. Her medications were not helping. She tapped routinely for a few days and 90% of it went away. Allergies These usually respond well. I have watched many people eliminate sinus drainage, itching eyes, sneezing and a host of other allergy related symptoms. Constipation Results vary widely here but, in my experience, success is usually achieved. One experienced an instant and permanent relief with one tapping session. Others needed to tap daily for a few weeks before years and years of constipation subsided. Please remember that you will not always get immediate relief from your physical ailment and sometimes the tapping will not appear to work. Be patient....and persistent. All you are expending is time. The odds are in your favor if you keep with it. This applies to all ailments....not just constipation. Eyesight I have seen many people improve their eyesight with EFT....at least temporarily. People come up on stage with me, do The Basic Recipe for eyesight, and then report noticeably clearer vision. I have not carried through on this and cannot report on any permanent changes. I suspect, however, that permanent improvement is possible with persistence. Arthritis Arthritic pain often reduces under The Basic Recipe. I've seen this many times. Because of the underlying condition, however, it does tend to return. Thus you must address the symptoms and the underlying disease. Can you reverse arthritis and get rid of it forever with EFT? I don't know because no one, to my knowledge, has persistently used these techniques for these purposes. Conventional wisdom tells us that arthritis is not reversible. It cannot be cured. It can only be arrested. However, I was diagnosed with arthritis in 1986 and have no sign of it today. I didn't use EFT at the time because I didn't know about it. It left as a result of fasting and changes in my diet, lifestyle and frame of mind. I'm convinced that EFT would have hastened my cure. "},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"71 Using EFT to Enhance Your Self Image The cause of a poor self image The term \"poor self image\" refers to a generally negative feeling about one's self. Authorities on the subject have not developed a precise definition for it nor have they pinpointed an exact cause. Accordingly, there is no agreed upon way to handle it. EFT, by contrast, is much more precise in its approach and pinpoints an exact cause. Here it is: The cause of a poor self image is an accumulation of negative emotions about one's self. This is self evident and is stated here because, in these terms, EFT makes eminently good sense. If we eliminate the negative emoti ons then we eliminate the cause. And without the cause the poor self image fades away. And what better tool to eliminate the negative emotions than EFT? Poor self image may be the world's number one ailment. It is so prevalent that almost everyone carries around some degree of it. Our self image is often equated with our self confidence. We tend to \"radiate\" it through our mannerisms, posture, words and gestures and others \"pick it up\" whether we want them to or not. Accordingly, it has a major effect on our business, social, and personal performance. Sometimes jobs, promotions and sales are won or lost depending on how we radiate our inner thoughts to others. Friendships and romantic encounters can flourish or die depending on how we project our feelings about ourselves. The lower our self image, the easier it is to get upset and the more intense become our anger, guilt, jealousy and other emotional responses. When our self image is low we tend to stay stuck in one place. We don't venture into that new business or get out of that abusive relationship or try something new. Some parts of our lives can be very dull and depressing. In short, our self image is the centerpiece of our emotional strength. The quality of our lives often depends on it. Go to the self help section of any major bookstore and there you will find countless books with solutions to the self image problem. In general, they emphasize positive attitudes and give exercises for looking at the brighter side of life. They encourage focusing on your strengths rather than your weaknesses and some emphasize visualization and affirmations to help you achieve these things. I applaud them all. I'm in favor of anything that helps and many of these approaches do help people improve their self images. The results are a bit spotty, however. An improvement here. A new attitude there. Rarely does anyone achieve an across the board, dramatically improved self image with these tools. The reason so many of these techniques fall short is that they do very little to neutralize all the self doubt and negative feelings that make up the poor self image. Rather, they try to overwhelm them with megadoses of positivism. This is a laudable effort, of course, but one's established self doubts and negative feelings can be rather stubborn. If your journey through life is like a bus ride, then these self doubts and negative feelings are passengers on your bus. You are at the wheel and they are your \"back seat drivers\" who think they own the front seats. Conventional methods won't move them much. EFT offers a refreshing new approach to this problem where dramatic, across the board changes do occur. I have seen people totally transformed by these techniques. Their mannerisms, posture, words and gestures all change to reflect a more positive, self assured person. Their friends and co-workers comment on the \"new\" person that has evolved before their eyes. Rather than try to install new attitudes and perspectives, as conventional methods tend to do, EFT effectively liberates one from their self doubts and negative feelings. They loosen those unwanted passengers from their front seat positions and kick them off the bus. Once off the bus, they no longer contribute to a poor self image. The self doubts and negative feelings that make up a poor self image are forms of \"negative emotions\" which, of course, are what EFT was designed to handle. Remember the discovery statement upon which EFT is built... \"The cause of all negative emotions is a disruption in the body's energy system.\" With this in mind, the process to improve your self image is simple. Just perform The Basic Recipe on every negative emotion you have. One by one they leave and, as they do, the balance between your positive and negative emotions shifts inevitably toward the positive. A refreshing and confident new self image bubbles up to the surface. The baggage has been thrown off your bus."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"72 This is a perfect place to use the previously mentioned Personal Peace Procedure. It automatically addresses all those negative specific events that intrude upon an otherwise healthy self image. The forest and trees metaphor Here's a metaphor that will further help your understanding of this concept. Consider each of your negative emotions or specific events as a tree in a negative self image forest. They might be reflective of things from your past like rejections, abuse, failures, fears, guilt, etc. There may be hundreds of them and they may be so thick as to resemble a jungle. Let's assume, though, that there are 100 diseased trees in your self image forest. If you cut one of them down (by neutralizing it w ith EFT) you still have 99 left. While you will get some noticeable, and much appreciated, emotional relief from removing that one tree, you still haven't made much of a dent in the self image forest. But what would happen if you methodically cut down one tree per day? Gradually, the forest would thin out. You would have more room to move within it and it would be a freer place in which to reside. Eventually...with persistent use of EFT...all the trees disappear and in their place is a much more emotionally free you. The world looks different when the forest (or jungle) is gone and a new self image emerges. Generalization Fortunately, you will not have to cut down all 100 trees to get your result. That's because using EFT to neutralize a few negative emotions of a given type will tend to generalize over the remaining negative emotions of that same type. For example, assume that in your forest you have a clump of 10 trees known as \"abusive experiences.\" Take the biggest (most intense) trees in that clump first and cut them down with EFT. Once you have done 3 or 4 of them, you will usually find that the remaining 6 or 7 fall on their own. Balancing the energy system for some trees then spreads to other trees of the same type. You can then repeat this generalization concept with other clumps that might be called \"failures\" or \"rejections.\" In this way, a 100 tree forest might be cleared by cutting down approximately 30 trees. Be an observer With EFT, shifts in self image come much faster and much more powerfully than with conventional methods. But the shifts don't happen as rapidly as with phobias and distressing memories. EFT frequently handles those in moments whereas complete self image changes often take weeks. This is because the shifts in self image are the result of the time consuming elimination of numerous negative emotions (trees)....one at a time. When I say that complete self image changes often take weeks, I do not mean that nothing is happening in the meantime. On the contrary, with each tree that is removed from the forest a shift in one's self image takes place. However, the immediate emotional freedom that comes from the removal of that one tree does not usually make a noticeable change in the much larger self image problem. But the cumulative change that comes from removing several trees is noticeable if you become an \"observer\" of what is happening. The changes that happen within you are gradual, subtle and powerful. They feel so natural that you don't even realize that the shift is taking place. Eventually, your friends will comment on your changes and then you will have incontrovertible proof. But, until then, you need to be an \"observer\" and tune yourself into what is going on. Notice, for example, how you handled a recent rejection more matter-of-factly than before. Observe how you speak up more often and how you are taking better care of yourself. Listen to how the tone of your own conversations are shifting toward the positive. Watch the reactions of others toward you as you radiate a more assured self image. Being an \"observer\" is important because, without it, you might conclude that nothing is happening and give up on the process. How to proceed The method here is simple. It is the essence of The Personal Peace Procedure. There are only two steps: 1. Make a list of every past negative emotion you can think of. Include every time you had fear, rejection, guilt, anger, abuse, tears or any other negative emotion. Include both the big ones and the little ones but put the big ones on top. This is because you want to neutralize them first. Don't concern yourself if you can't think of every one of them at first. You can add to the list as they occur to you over time. 2. Then use The Basic Recipe everyday to \"cut down a tree\" from your list. Do this daily until no more negative emotions (trees) exist. Be sure to \"observe\" your progress along the way. You may do this more than once per day if your schedule permits and you may cut down more than one tree per session. However, you must handle each tree separately. Don't lump them together in the same trip through The Basic Recipe."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"73 After a few days into the process, you will notice that the \"big trees\" you started with don't seem to show up in your life any more. That is typical and there is a lot of freedom in that. Enjoy it. Summary of the EFT Videos and Audios on DVD Note: The EFT videos and audios are discussed and su mmarized in various sections of this manual. To avoid the cumbersomeness of flipping through the manua l to reference a particular taped session, they are being summarized here once again. Important Note to those downloading this manual for free from the internet: This Manual refers to videos and audios (below) that are included in the much more comprehensive EFT Course. Those videos and audios are available at https://www.emofree.com/eftstore However, this manual provides all the basics. The videos and audios are not unnecessary unless you want to expand your skills beyond beginner status. Also: If you haven’t already done so, please subscribe to our free EFT Insights Newsletter at http://www.emofree.com/subscribe.asp The Videos For Part I Note: Originally, there were 3 videos in Part I. Subsequently, the videos were put on DVDs (which dramatically lowered the cost). This necessitated breaking up the somewhat lengthy videotapes 1 and 2 into DVD Videos 1a, 1b, 2a and 2b. It was not necessary to break up video 3. It is on a single DVD. Video 1a In this video Adrienne a nd I augment this manual by visually showing you each tapping point and how to perform each step of The Basic Recipe. We assume in this segment that you have already read the manual. It is vitally important that you follow along with Adrienne and me and review this segment until you have memorized the whole one minute process. Once memorized, it is yours forever. Video 1b This is a complete demonstrate of the entire Basic Recipe with a delightfu l gentleman named Dave wherein we help him overcome a lifelong intense fear of water. Study this episode. Watch it several times. It is an excellent instructi onal session because it illustrates the handling of aspects so well. Video 2a This video contains the highlights of a live workshop where the theory behind EFT is explained and then EFT is applied to two groups of people on stage. One group is dealing with fears and the other with pain . Video 2b In this video we show you more case histories of EFT in action. Here are highlights of what you will see: **Larry: He overcomes intense claustrophobia while undergoing what would normally be his most tension filled circumstance....riding in the back seat of a small car in the busy traffic of San Francisco. **Pam: A chocoholic no longer wants her chocolate. **Becci: Her fear of rats makes her hands sweat at the mere thought of one. She ends up having a live rat lick her fingers and says, “I don’t believe I’m doing this. I am doing this.” **Stephen: A 6 year old boy is taught these techniques by his father and quits biting his fingernails . **Adam: This is my son who uses EFT to knock 14 strokes off of his golf score . **Cheryl: She shows up at one of our workshops and describes how she used EFT with me for the fear of public speaking . Our original session was performed over a year ago and she has not had the fear since. **Jackie: She had an accident 10 years ago which left her unable to raise her arm any more than a few inches without having intense pain in her shoulder . In a few minutes on stage she gets complete relief"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"74 from the problem and can lift her arm at will without pain. This session shows our conversation after the workshop where we discuss this “miracle.” **Cindy: Like Jackie above, Cindy had an accident 3 years ago and has not been able to lift her arm without pain . She has seen numerous physicians and therapists without any material result. In a few minutes with EFT, she lifts her arm as high as she can with no pain whatsoever. **Veronica: Starts with a heavy desire for a cigarette and then uses EFT to eliminate the craving. She then undergoes strong emotions about being raped by her father . After this one session (which you will watch in its entirety) she gets completely over this traumatic memory. **Norma: She is dyslexic and has always needed to read things 4 or 5 times before she could understand them. She gets over that in minutes and gets a new job that requires her to read out loud to people. Video 3 This video is entitled “6 Days at the VA” and shows the highlights of our visit to the Veterans Administration in Los Angeles to help the emotionally disabled veterans of the Vietnam war. This puts EFT to the ultimate test because most of these soldiers have been in therapy for over 20 years with little or no progress. You will watch thei r emotional intensity melt away in moments. Nowhere is there a greater testimonial to the power of what you are learning. I mention this touching episode in my “Open Letter” at the start of this manual. Important note Please note that throughout Videos 2a, 2b and 3, Adrienne and I use various shortcuts that we have learned over the years. With our extensive training we know when to shorten the process and we always do so in the interest of efficiency. Remember, we are usually dealing with skeptical strangers and are often doing so under the most difficult of circumstances....on stage. Accordingly, we use shortcuts (described in Part II of this course) whenever possible and rarely do the entire Basic Recipe. Rest assured, however, that if we had taken the time to perform the more thorough process you are learning in Part I of this course, we would have achieved the same results. It would have taken a few seconds longer per round...that's all. The main purpose of these sessions is to give you a head start in the direction of experience by showing you how these techniques work in the real world...with real people...over a wide variety of problems. They take you out of the classroom and show you how these techniques are administered and how people respond. Also, in some cases, some of the tapping has been edited out so that the session \"moves along\" on film. This allows the wider experience to come through without being burdened by the constant repetition of the procedures you have learned elsewhere in this course. I am not teaching The Basic Recipe here on videos 2a, 2b and #3. That is done rather thoroughly in the earlier parts of this manual and on vide o 1. Videos 2a, 2b and 3 are all about experience. The Video Recordings on DVD for Part II (8 videos) Video 1 – Overview This video is a bridge between Part I and Part II wherein Part I is recapped and many of the new concepts included in the Part II manual are reviewed. Here we discuss the impediments to perfection, shortcuts and the forest and trees metaphor. Video 2 - Audience Examples The rest of these videos contain a condensed combination of two 3 day seminars. This video starts at the beginning of those seminars and explores a wide variety of issues...both emotional and physical...and lends an invaluable perspective to the far reaching power of EFT. It discusses issues such as the fear of public speaking, agoraphobia, anxiety, migraine headaches, physical pain, fear of flying, depression, fibromyalgia and high blood pressure. There is also a discussion from the stage of The Discovery Statement and some important demonstrations of Psychological Reversal. These latter demonstrations are critically important for you to study. Video 3 - Emotional Issues I There are three sessions on this video. The first is with Jason who works with anger and betrayal as a result of his wife leaving him and issuing a restraining order that prohibited him from seeing his daughter."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"75 The second session is with Veronica. You will recognize her as the lady who used EFT for being raped by her father in the second video in Part I. She appears here, 3 or 4 months later, and still has no emotional problems with that specific issue. This is incontrovertible evidence of the power of EFT under even the most intense of issues. On this video, she works on an entirely different issue. She has obviously intense emotions about being abandoned , alone and not being loved as a small child. Our session with EFT eliminates the problem and she comes back the next day to report that she feels \"light as a feather.\" The third session is with Sandhya who works through her emotions regarding the experiences her father had during the World War II Holocaust. Video 4 - Emotional Issues II There are two sessions on this video. In the first session, Marlys uses EFT to get over \" love pain \"...an obsession over the loss of romantic relationships. As this EFT session unfolds, several aspects show up and the issues shift in a daisy chai n fashion. It eventually evolves into the fact that her mother didn't love her and, after using EFT, she laughs about it. In the second session, Kathy has three issues: (1) a fear of being touched (hugged), (2) a traumatic incident where her mother threw boiling water on her and (3) a sore shoulder which is related to her having to fend off beatings. She responds beautifully to EFT and The Setup (Psychological Reversal) is not necessary even though numerous rounds of EFT are performed. Video 5 - Physical Issues There are four sessions on this video. First, Connie J. has tightness in her jaw that comes from clenching her teeth at night. The clenching is so severe that she has to wear a bite plate at night to protect her teeth. With EFT, she achieves complete freedom from this problem in minutes even though it has been with her for 2 or 3 years. She also had a headache which she eliminated on her own using EFT. Second, Patricia came on stage with an episode of asthma from which she had suffered for over 10 years. She gets dramatic relief with EFT and reports that it is still gone the next morning. She also experiences major relief from a back problem even though she has herniated discs. Dorothy came on stage with an irregular heartbeat which is an ailment for which EFT had never been used. Since we try it on everything , we applied EFT to it with excellent results. Connie M. uses EFT for her neck pain which, according to her, came about because of emotional issues. She gets complete relief. Video 6 - Addictive Cravings This session starts with two ladies who run an eating disorder clinic. The concepts in this conversation lead into the causes behind all addictive behaviors, including eating disorders. Then follows (1) an important discussion of the causes of addictions and (2) an entire session where EFT is used on a group of people to overcome the immediate cravings for chocolate, cigarettes and alcohol . Video 7 - Energy Toxins, Phobias & Persistence This important video emphasizes the effect of energy toxins and the value of persistence when using EFT. The first part is an interview with Todd who gets nowhere during the seminar because energy toxins are in his way. He then comes back, a month later, to tell the members of another seminar about the dramatic effect a change in his diet had been on his sleep disorder , eye pain and depression . Next is an unusual session where several people experience improvement on their snake phobias . However, even though the improvements are dramatic by conventional standards, they are considered slow and relatively ineffective by EFT standards. This is due to suspected energy toxins within the room. Persistence is required to generate relief for most of these people. Finally, we show the value of persistence in a session with Grace who was beset with intense depression and many other issues. We make little headway on stage but her persistence and attention to her diet in the following weeks creates major improvement in her emotional well being. She tells of this enthusiastically in a phone conversation. Video 8 - Common Problems and Q&A This is a catch-all video that explains EFT's use in such areas as sports (golf), business , public speaking, procrastination, self image and relationships. It also entertains numerous common questions from the audience to round out your understanding."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"76 The Audio Recordings on DVD For Part I To further widen your experience with EFT, I have included several hours of case histories on the audios. As in the videos, you won't be just listening to theory. These are real people with real problems. You will hear some people get over lifelong problems in moments while others require persistence. You will hear Adrienne and me apply EFT to some severe emotional problems and listen to them disappear right on the audio. You will also hear some partial relief for some ailments that doesn't go away completely. In short, these audios add to your rainbow of experience, thereby giving you a useful background that you can use when applying EFT. Read these points before you listen to them. **These audios contain a series of telephone sessions conducted by my business associate, Adrienne Fowlie, and me. They are a collection of authentic sessions recorded with a desktop tape recorder. While the sound quality is certainly adequate, the recordings were obviously not made in the pristine atmosphere of a recording studio. **Some of these sessions are with people who are actually undergoing EFT. As you listen in, you will literally be a first hand “observer” as people apply these techniques to a wide variety of emotional and physical problems . This will give you an invaluable “feel” for what you can expect when you apply EFT to yourself and others. **Other sessions are with people who have used EFT in the past and are telling about their experiences since then. This gives you a good sense of the lasting nature of these techniques. **The purpose of these audios is to expand your experience of these techniques. It is not to teach the tapping processes themselves. That is done by the manual and Video 1a. Thus, as in videos 2a, 2b and 3, I have edited out much of the tapping so you can focus on people’s responses and the other details involved in the techniques. **You will be listening in on some highly personal problems and you will be doing so with the permission of those involved. They did it so others (like you) could benefit from these marvelous techniques. We owe them all a thank you. **Repetition is very important in learning. Accordingly, you will hear me repeat some important points, from different angles, many times during these recordings. This is not to bore you. It is to embed important concepts into your thinking. **These sessions are for your education and not your entertainment (although some of them are very entertaining). I could have made them short and snappy...editing them to make a couple of quick points each time...and then moved on. Doing so would rob you of some of the “feel” and “depth” to these processes. On the other hand, some conversations get off the subject and delve into areas outside the interest of this course. In editing these audios for your education, I have drawn a blend between these two extremes always erring on the side of including as much useful information as I can. **Please note that the tapping you do hear on these audios will seem different than what you are being taught. It is not, in fact, different. It is simply shorter and takes a somewhat different form. **As I mentioned in the section on the videos, Adrienne and I are advanced practitioners of these techniques and have been doing them for many years. Accordingly, we use some of the same short cuts previously mentioned. But there's another technique that is used in the audios. Adrienne and I have invested the time and money to learn Dr. Roger Callahan’s Voice Technology in an effort to better assess the tapping points, existence of Psychological Reversal, etc. We used this form of diagnosis on these audios to save time but are, at all times, using the same tapping points that you are learning. When I first learned Voice Technology I thought it was a major aid in applying these procedures. After years of experience, however, I no longer believe it has any material value and have discontinued using it. I have developed a more useful diagnostic technique which is taught in great detail in our video set “Steps Toward Becoming The Ultimate Therapist.” Those interested in this advanced training should consult those videos. As previously stated, diagnosis is beyond the scope of this course. The Basic Recipe (using the 100% overhaul concept) is being taught instead because"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"77 it is an adequate substitute for the vast majority of cases. It takes a few seconds longer per round to perform and you may need to do a few more rounds (persistence) to get the same results. In any event, we are talking extra seconds or minutes here (per problem)...not weeks or months. **Notice in these audios not only what people say but also the differences in their voices before and after using EFT. Also notice that many times people emit a very relaxed “sigh” after tapping. This evidences the release of emotional burdens. **On a few of the audios you will hear a “thump, thump, thump” in the background. This is the result of a malfunction in my tape recorder and is not someone’s heart beating. **You may be tempted to look at the \"Session by Session Summary\" below and go right to “your issue” on the audios. That’s human nature, I suppose, but please don’t ignore the rest of these audios just because they don’t seem to apply to you for the moment. They contain valuable insights that will magnify your abilities with EFT. Session by session summary 1.
