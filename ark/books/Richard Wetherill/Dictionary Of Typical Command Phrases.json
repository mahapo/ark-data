What they mean is that we think our way into trouble. Most of us are proud of our brainpower, but we are not proud of our ability to get into trouble. That is something we do in- advertently until we understand. The process by which we do it is extremely subtle. Lust, for example, is an emotion that has the effect of driving a person in a wrong direction while reducing his intelligence. He is busy with consideration of what he wants. Therefore, he does not realize what he is doing to his mind. As everybody who understands the law of abso- lute right is aware, he is in stalling distortions of logic. What is a distortion of logic? It is a wrong idea ac- cepted as a right idea, an unt ruth accepted as a truth, an emotional command to self. Once installed, it operates as if by compulsion. “If ever I get the chance,” a young person might say to himself, “I’ll certainly take advantage of it!” He or she may suppose he is engaged in harmless but pleasant reverie; instead, he is moving into a mental trap. He may assert that by today’s standards sexuality is no sin, and he may argue that fantas izing about it has no really harmful effects, but such c onsiderations are beside the point. The point is that he has deprived himself of volition on that topic. 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"When the chance for a sexual approach arrives and there are no stronger compulsi ons controlling him, he may engage in what is popularly known as sexual harassment— in the workplace or in social encounters. Or he may propo- sition a willing partner. A single command is enough if it happens to fit the situation and does not happen to be contradicted effec- tively. The prevalence of sexual harassment and sexual promiscuity is testimony to th e prevalence of such com- mands. Sexual behavior is by no means the only kind of com- pulsive behavior. Command phras es of distortions of logic make compulsive smokers and drinkers who would like to stop smoking or drinking but know they can’t. Their trou- ble may go back to childhood when they pretended to like smoking or drinking although they didn’t, pretended their smoking or drinking was necessary to their enjoyment of life when it wasn’t, and pretended they thus proved matur- ity when they didn’t. People have problems they ca nnot solve, and the condi- tion is so general that it is c onsidered normal. Every person suffers from an unending succession of preventable frustra- tions in addition to a wide variety of mental, emotional and physical illnesses and afflictions of various other kinds. Each person is able to detect flaws and faults in others, and because their flaws and faults are so obvious to him, he tends to criticize them freel y. Because his own flaws and faults are nearly always con cealed from him, he is puzzled by their criticism of him. Quite naturally he feels that he doesn’t deserve it. The result of that frustrating situation is just what we see in this world on all side s: unsolved human problems. 4"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"What we need is not the ability to see flaws and faults in others. We have that. We need the ability to see flaws and faults in ourselves. More important, we need to enable everybody to acquire th at ability. Most important, we need to communicate the ability to persons who have assumed the tasks of leadership in ev ery field of human betterment. The story of humanetics offers that and more. It offers the remedy for afflictions of ma ny kinds. It offers a totally new approach to family life, the conduct of business and meaningful personal relati onships. Everybody who studies this book until he understands th e information will realize that it does, in fact, offer all that has been stated. The statement that understanding the information called humanetics enables a person to solve many kinds of prob- lems can be justified in a few words: People think their way into trouble; therefore, they can think their way out. Any- thing that enables a person to think his way out of trouble is a technique of humanetics. It used to be popular to say that people were honest. Now that various examples of widespread public and pri- vate scandal have been expos ed and described in detail, people are at last able to f ace the fact that dishonesty is rather universally practiced. It is even more widespread than the public yet suspects; much dishonesty still remains hidden. Exposing dishonesty in public activities may be rather easy, but consider the difficulty of exposing the dishonest thinking by which an outwardly virtuous person commits many wrongs in his heart. Humanetics does not work by public exposure. It works instead by private exposure. It gives each person an aston- 5"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"ishing mental cleansing that enables his activities to make complete sense. It provides him with purpose in life. Every distortion of logic is installed when the individ- ual turns his mind in a wrong direction while his intelli- gence is reduced by emotion. He may invent the command phrase, or he may copy the phrase from someone else. He may adopt it merely because he somehow picks it up while he feels emotion that may have little or no relation to the words of the command phrase. His contribution may be di- rect or indirect, but it always includes rebelli on against life. By rebellious thinking a pers on forms his distortions of logic. Each distortion is desc ribed by its command phrase. Each command phrase contains a statement of the com- mand that must be obeyed in various situations where it applies, and also eith er states or implies what situations call for obedience to the command. Bo th the statement of the command and the statement of the situation demanding obedience are obvious in the phrase, “If ever I get the chance, I’ll certainly take advantage of it!” Sometimes the command and situation demanding obedience are less evi- dent, but always they are either stated or somehow implied. Consideration of the cause -and-effect sequence by which a person gets into trouble clearly shows that he does not need to do the wrong thinking consciously to get a wrong result. But he does need to be rebellious. When he is rebellious, all the thinking he does and all the concepts by which he is influenced tend to distort his thinking. If he is emotional, even a statement of truth becomes fixed, rigid and inflexible. It gets used in ways in which it does not ap- ply. For example, when the words “I have to be right” are installed as a distortion of logic, they force the individual to 6"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"be very unreasonable and under a compulsion to think he is right when, because of the distortion, he is not. From the foregoing, an alert- minded reader can discern the basic fact that every comma nd phrase of a distortion of logic holds the seed of a punishment that continues until the command phrase is released. Persons who understand know that when the command phrase technique is used, a change occurs within the mind that causes a spontaneous cha nge otherwise unexplainable. They know that anyone who makes the specific change from wrong to right thinking, whether he knows about hu- manetics or not, will get a rele ase, just as he can use an electric switch without understa nding electricity. They also know that the importance of this information is its ability to teach people how to induce n eeded corrections by direct intent. Consider the compulsive pe rson who tells himself, “If ever I get the chance, I’ll certainly take advantage of it! “ By forming a command containi ng those words, he gives himself a compulsion to obey th e words in later situations where they would apply. Thus he thinks his way into trou- ble. He does it by one sudden flash of thinking, completed in an instant. He can think his way out of th e trouble, also in an in- stant, just by finding and reversing the precise thought that he used to get himself into the trouble. The words of the command are his key to escape from his mental jail. He uses the key by running the same words through his con- scious mind once again, but this time seeing how they dis- tort his thinking, realizing that they deceive him, or other- wise deciding that he is willing to drop them and stop act- ing in accord with them. One quick emotional decision is 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"enough to get him into trouble; one quick unemotional de- cision is enough to get him out of trouble. By making the decision that gets him into trouble, he loses integrity and volition on the topic of the decision. By making the decision that gets him out of trouble, he gains integrity and volition on the topic of the decision. By pro- gressively making the decisions needed to correct his dis- torted thinking, he progressive ly acquires integrity and vo- lition and stops his trouble. If you understand the foregoing explanation, you are aware of the process by which people think their way into trouble. The act happens in a flash. Under emotion, every con- cept that is formed becomes the command phrase of an- other distortion. Almost at once, in most cases, the victim of a new command phrase promptly forgets he ever thought such words. Therefore, he quite unwittingly accumulates command phrases in profusion over the years. Many of them go back to childhood and even to infancy, a fact that persons who participated in our behavioral research discov- ered. Everybody who investigates sees the evidence. It is generally assumed that we live in the age of reason, and so we do. But it is a sad fact that often we reason from untruth instead of from truth, which is another way of say- ing we reason from the comma nd phrases of our distortions of logic. That explains why there are such amazing exam- ples of irrational behavior reported in the daily news. The fact is that by people’s widespread dishonesty they convict themselves of having relied on the pow er of the lie, rather than the power of truth . They may think they can avoid trouble by deviations fr om honesty, but the study of 8"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"humanetics shows that each pi ece of dishonesty carries a hidden price that dwarfs what ever seeming advantage the dishonesty might seem to gain. Next the kernel of humane tics is going to be stated again for purposes of review. People invite trouble by fo rming or adopting commands in their moments of emotion. T hus they distor t their think- ing by allowing a subtle influen ce to reach into their minds and make them illogical. But just as they have invited trou- ble by thinking, they can end it by unthinking exactly the same thoughts—merely giving them a quick flash of un- emotional attention. The wording of each emotional thought is known in humanetics as the command phrase. That is not the usual pro cedure for ending trouble. Usu- ally a person would resist wr ong behavior by resolution, as by saying to himself “I’ll contro l my urges” without realiz- ing that he is merely gi ving himself another command phrase to contradict those alr eady automating him. As part of the process of going from bad to worse, he might add “I’m hopelessly out of control” and thus give himself a ten- dency to become so. By positive thinking and also by nega- tive thinking, he automates hi mself for increasing trouble. As soon as a person understands what he is doing, he starts to deprogram himself by applic ation of the information of humanetics. The conventional procedure is to “bring up” command phrases. That is a kind of me ntal recall occurring easily when a person honestly attempts to solve his problems. He can begin by using this book. As he reads each command phrase, he can think his way through to recognition of the sort of trouble it can cause. He can try the command phrase on himself, so to 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"speak, to see if it fits his own pattern of thinking. When necessary, he can tailor it to ma ke it fit. Every time a per- son finds or detects one of his command phrases and gives it the least unemotional attenti on, he corrects a distortion of logic. Often he may find hi s imagination providing com- mand phrases very different from those given in this book. In each case he will be able to make an additional correc- tion. A thousand command phrases may contribute to a sin- gle compulsion, and this book is replete with examples in 1008 alphabetical categories. If you want a quick look at the kinds of trouble that can be caused by command phrases, riffle through some of the headings. By reading the book repeatedly, a person develops the ability to apply th e technique. Presently he finds himself bringing up command phrases easily, and he or she un- thinks his way out of trouble and into a productive, new life. 10"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"A Abhorrence: I abhor the thought of what might happen as I become older. I shrink away from every disagreeable task. I can’t make myself thi nk about anything that is ab- horrent. If I give in, I’m sure the consequence will be too terrible to face. I can’t stand facing facts. The whole idea of having to take care of a whining child fills me with horror. Work is abhorrent to me. I hate to think of what will hap- pen if I don’t get my problems solved. I abhor complainers. Ability: My ability is so great that I needn’t try. I ha- ven’t a bit of ability. I get bad marks in school, so I lack ability. I haven’t the ability to manage my life successfully. Nobody would want a person with my abilities. I’m not one of the talented members of my family. I don’t have the abil- ity to learn anything new. I simp ly can’t stay out of trouble. When I try to perform in public, I get excited and lose all my ability. I have abilities most people are too stupid to understand. My abilities make me superior to the rest of my family. Abnormality: I’m not a bit like anybody around me. I’m going to have some kind of difference to set me apart. I am going to get attention whatever way I can. I have an ab- normal appetite and it makes me abnormally fat. If I’m normal, I’ll be sure to get lost in the crowd. I can capitalize on abnormalities. I demand much more than anyone else, and I get it. I’ve got to be different. Abortion: When anything becomes a drag, I get rid of it. I never see anything through to its conclusion. I’ll never carry anything around with me. Everything I really want, I lose. I can’t go full term. I’ ll not let anything weigh me down. I’m going to lose all my excess baggage. All my 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"plans just die. Nothing ever works out for me.

My sins keep coming to the surface. My enthusiasm is infectious. My problems keep pushing out. Absenteeism: I need a day off to catch up with my homework. If I don’t get some rest, I won’t get anything done anyhow. I have to change what I’m doing every day. No one misses me when I’m ab sent, so I may as well stay home. I’m a sucker to obey the rules. Any time I take a no- tion to stay out, I just do it. I can avoid doing wh at I hate if I’m not here. I need a couple days to myself. Absentmindedness: I’ll never be able to remember. Nothing stays with me. My mother has no brain for re- membering, and that’s my trouble too. I never remember a thing unless I write it down. I forget all the things I dislike. My brain is like a sieve. Every piece of information goes out of my mind the mi nute after I hear it. Someday I’ll have the time to sit down and think, but not now. I’m going to postpone the inevitable someho w. I can’t keep anything in mind. Abuse: If I know I can get away with it, I’ll abuse any- body who comes near me. The abuse I have suffered has permanently scarred my life. I can abuse my body as I see fit. I can’t make progress ar ound here without abusing my privileges. I have to accept abuse for the sake of my princi- ples. When I know I’m in cont rol, I’ll be tough on anyone 12"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"who crosses me.

If someone starts giving me a hard time, he’ll get back more than he gives. I can’t tolerate abusiveness. I’m always tak- ing insults, arguments and back talk from my relatives. I won’t stand for criticisms and unfair scoldings. People al- ways pick on me. I’ll make th em wish I weren’t here. I wouldn’t touch him, but I’ll find some tricky way of mak- ing him wish he were dead. Acceleration: I have to accelerate my pace to keep up. I’m going to show my dad he can’t keep ahead of me. When I have to go, I have to go fast. I’ve got to get going in a hurry to keep up. I’m going to keep things moving at a rapid pace. I can’t resist step ping on the gas when I see a clear road ahead of me. Nobody is going to get going faster than I do. Unless I speed up, I’ll ne ver get anywhere at all. I keep trying to speed up. Acceptance: I can’t accept a new idea until everybody accepts it. I can’t accept discipline except from my parents. I won’t accept a fact just beca use it’s true. I will accept as true everything I learn in church. I can’t accept people of other races in my circle of friends. I’ll accept any new idea if it will make my wife happy. My acceptance depends on what my friends do. I can’t accept anything without first putting up a stiff battle. Accidents: I never do a thing in a rational way. I can’t have an accident because I’m always very careful. Every time I try to do something new, I get hurt. I can get through any tight place. If I must be careful to stay out of accidents, life isn’t worth much to me. I’m going to do whatever I want to do, and I don’t care about the consequences.

Nobody wants accurate de- tails. I don’t care to be accurate. When I’m accurate, it al- ways makes someone mad at me . I hate to be pinned down to an exact answer. I’m tired of trying to be accurate. Accu- racy never gets me anywhere. Accusing: If I ever get in a bad spot, I’ll blame the other kids. Somebody is always putting me on the spot. I get blamed for everything. I’m constantly being accused of acts I do not commit. If you accu se people, you keep them off your back. Accuse first and prove later. I can get away with most accusations. Someday I’ll get back at the persons who have accused me. If I blame someone else, I avoid suspicion. I enjoy accusing others. Aches: When I get sick, I ache in all my joints. My life is nothing but aches and pains. I am aching to speak my mind, but I’m afraid. Ever sin ce my wife died, my life has been an aching void. My work is painfully dull. When you get older, you have to expect aches and pains. I’m aching to get into the sort of work I like. My troubles are the kind that don’t show. I have ever ything worse than anyone else. My aching back gets me down. Achievement: I won’t stop trying until I achieve my ends. I can’t rest until I achieve my ambition for my chil- dren. It takes competition to achieve results. My achieve- ments are the most important things in my life. I never can achieve peace of mind. If my achievements are small, they will not be noticed, and neither will I. I must make sure my achievements are credited to me. 14"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Acidosis: Everything I eat turns to acid in my stomach. I have to put myself to the acid test.

Acidosis runs in my family. When I lose my temper, I always get acid indigestion. Acid food upsets me. Acne: I’ve got to break out. I am going to have atten- tion. The world is breaking out all around me. I’ll make people look at me somehow. Pe ople are always very rough on me. As soon as I’m old enough to do it, I’ll break out. I have to keep my badness just under the surface. Nothing can be hidden. Cleaning my face always makes me sore. I can’t keep the badness in. Acquiescence: I have to accept the inevitable. If I don’t give in, I’ll be in trouble. I’l l do what they ask me to now, but when I grow up, I’ll do what I please. I have to give in to others. I’m going to give in to him so I can keep him happy. There is no use having any desires of my own. I’ll say what they want and I’ll think what I please. If I don’t give in to him, he won’t give out to me. I always give up when I’m pushed. Acrimony: I have a temper shar p as a razor’s edge. When I criticize someone, I want to see him suffer. My tongue is as sharp as a two-edged sword. When I talk to her, I can’t keep the bitterness out of my voice. I like to make stinging retorts. I cannot resist a caustic answer when I’m sure I’m getting overheard. Acid drips from my tongue. I’m bitter so I intend to let ev eryone know about it. I like to make people cringe. Acting: I have to act a part al l the time. No one would be interested in a dull person, so I’ll ham it up.

An actress has to act up. I’ll act as if I like it. Action: I have to arouse plenty of action. I refuse to take action on any new idea unless it’s endorsed by a church. Action is too much annoyance for me. When somebody wants action, I’ll show it to him. Action calcu- lated to change my thinking is out. I’ll not take any action without long deliberation first. What action I take is my own business. I’ll bring all action to a standstill unless I get what I demand. I’m an action person. Addiction: I’m just addicted to trouble. Once I start something I can’t stop. The only way I can relax is to take drugs. Everything gets a hold on me. I’m a dope addict. The only way I can forget is to get stoned. I’m not strong enough to give up the things that are bad for me. Dope keeps me full of excitement. I can’t help myself when I have an addiction. I’m a work aholic and am addicted to expensive things. Admiration: I admire the man who doesn’t get caught. I admire a person who does what he pleases. I admire spunk in a person. I’m not happy unless I’ve somebody’s admiration.

It hurts to admit my mistakes. Nobody’s going to make me admit the truth. Adolescence: I sure hate the t hought of growing up. When I start to grow up, I’ll get out from under my mother’s control. When I get in my teens, I’ll assert myself. My parents just don’t understa nd kids. Everybody has trou- bles when he gets into his teens. I can’t stand changes all the time. New experiences make me nervous. As I get older, my troubles get more se rious. My first twenty years are sure to be the hardest. I’m going to prove I’m grown up. All teenagers get pimples. Adultery: I’m free to have anything I want. What someone else has always looks better to me. I am going to show her other women are attracted to me. All’s fair in love and war. I like to try other people’s merchandise. If my husband doesn’t give me what I want, I’ll find it elsewhere. I am entitled to take what I want. I find there is nothing more exciting than trying to seduce somebody who can’t be seduced. I’ll do what I please about sex after I’m married.

Advice: I just can’t control my affairs unless I get my father’s advice. I need advice from a sympathetic woman. When someone tries to give me advice, I rebel. I always do the opposite to what they say. Free advice is worth exactly what it costs. It burns me up to be told what they think I should do. I can’t take advice. When I see someone with a problem, I show my superiority by telling him what to do. I can’t decide anything unless I get the advice of experts. I can’t take advice from relativ es.

If I don’t at- tack first, he’ll win. I’ll be first with the most. I always come in swinging. Aging: Aging starts when you’re born. Age demands respect. The older I get, the more my infirmity bothers me. When I get past forty, I’ll grow flabby and old-looking. Burdens come with age. I want to be like Granddaddy. As I age, I’ll run down. If I hurry and get old, I can do what I want sooner. No one can boss me when I have white hair. The aging process is accelerated in my family. I’m old be- fore my time.

No one can do this job as well as I can. I can’t succeed unless I’ve got implicit faith in myself. I like myself the way I am even if no one else does. Egotism in others makes me sick. Ego- tistical people drive me crazy. No one else has faith in my 84"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"ability, but I have. When I hear an egotist talking, I shut my ears and think about something else. I won’t stay and listen to an egotistical person. Egotis m’s a cover-up for an inferi- ority complex.

I need lots of energy to do my work. Enjoyment: I’ll quit if I can’t enjoy what I’m doing. I have no enjoyment in my routine. I don’t enjoy hearing about my faults.

If I get too enthusiastic, they may make me stop. I have no enthusiasm for my job. When I believe in something, I get very enthusiastic about it. I can’t get enthused by her plans.

Epidemics: Nobody’s going to ge t anything I don’t have. I want to be like everyone around me. I’ve got to keep up with the gang. If everyone is going to be out, I’d like a few days off too. I’m one who never does things by halves. I get anything that is going around. Nothing escapes me. I like to follow the leader. I want what everyone else has. I’d hate to be left out of anything big. I’m sick of not getting what they have. Epilepsy: When I get upset, I go out of my control. When I blank out, I don’t have to face the truth. Too much bossing around gives me a fit. One way to get attention is to throw a fit. Whenever she makes me mad, I shake all over. I can’t help it when I react. I’m the only one who is going to exert control of my body. If I don’t get what I want, I’ll throw a fit. I’ll do a nything to get attention. When I fall asleep, I have to wake up again right away to learn if I’m really asleep instead of dead.

Ethics: When anything is legal, it’s safe. I must stick with my own group. It’s all ri ght if you can get away with it. Ethics are for the other fellow. My ethics cannot be questioned. I have no ethics. You can’t be ethical and get along in this world. It does not matter what you do if peo- ple think it’s all right. I have to live by my own code of eth- ics. I don’t care if it’s ethical, just so it’s legal. I’ve no time for ethics. I can’t be ethical and continue to succeed in my business. Evasiveness: I never let anyone pin me down to direct answers. I have to be evasiv e or get into a ruckus. I can evade an issue by changing the subject. When someone tries to pin me down, I wiggl e loose. When someone backs me into a corner, I can evade by returning the attack. It’s hard to evade trouble. I’ll evade the truth whenever I can. I have to learn to be evasive.

Exaggeration: I couldn’t stand my life if I had to ac- cept it as it really is. If I ex aggerate, I can’t be criticized for that. No one wants to listen to facts. I can’t tell a story without exaggerating the details. I have to embellish the truth. I always exaggerate to shock my listeners. It is more interesting if it is exaggerated. I don’t believe what he says to me because he always exa ggerates. I take anything she says with a grain of salt. I am a born storyteller. Examinations: I worry that I’m going to fail my ex- ams. I get panicky every time I think of taking a test. I can’t stand tests—they make me si ck. No use studying; I know I’ll flunk. I get petrified when I know an examination is to be taken. Examinations are worse than nightmares for me. I can’t do anything right with every one of my movements being watched. I can’t stand being examined. Before an examination, I stay awake half the night. Thinking of ex- aminations makes me get cold and clammy. Exasperation: It exasperates me to see the way my children waste money.

G ood excuses are better than smart answers. I don’t make excuses for myself, and I won’t accept anyone else’s. If I have a good enough ex- cuse, I can get out of anything. If I get sick, I’ll have a good excuse to get out of work. I make up such good excuses no one can blame me. Everybody offers excuses; so will I. I try to expose anybody who hides behind an excuse. You’ve got to have an excuse when you fail. Exhaustion: I’m too tired to go on. The slightest exer- tion leaves me exhausted. I f eel all gone. I’m always tired out. If I do anything at all, it is more than I have energy for. I can’t refresh myself. I’ve never had enough energy to work for a living. I’m all in. It ’s just too much trouble to try.

My eyesight is terrible. I can get out of doing the things I hate if I can’t see right. My ey esight is getting worse from the close work I do. I inherited my parents’ bad eyesight. My eyesight worsens, the older I get. I can’t see past the end of my nose. If I can’t see, they’ll have to take care of me. I’m afraid to look. What I can’t see, I don’t have to reason from. There are certain th ings I refuse to look at. I choose what I’m willing to see. I’m blinded to my faults. F Face: I’ll do anything I can to save my face. My face tells all my secrets.

If I put something in my mouth that I don’t like, it makes me sick. Anybody who wears false teeth has trouble with his gums. I’ll never be sa tisfied with anything except my own teeth.

Fanaticism: Unless I go all out, I won’t be able to con- vince anybody. I must go overboard to be sure they com- prehend. The best way to become famous is to be fanatical. I’m a fanatic on the subject of salvation. When someone claims he has new information, I know he’s a fanatic. If I sound different, they’ll notice me.

I can make a nyone cringe by saying what’s wrong with him. I can tell a nybody how to improve. I take people apart in my mind. Favoritism: The people I really like can take liberties. When I ask something from a friend, I’m likely to get it. It pays to be friendly. I can al ways take advantage of friend- ship. I refuse to let anybody play favorites in my presence.

When I’m big, I’ll stay away from water. Female Trouble: I can’t ever be sa tisfied unless I do a thing to excess. Women have more ways to go bad than men. Women never do things right. When I get angry, I re- fuse to function. I’ll show my husband how much trouble he’s caused me. I’m always running on. Women suffer more than men. I need some excuse to take a rest now and then. I’m forced to do all the suffering for this family. Now the whole bottom is falling out of everything for me. Fever: People burn me up. When I want to get ahead, I turn into a ball of fire.

Someday I’ll be the boss, and then I’ll fire him. Flattery: I like to be told I’m good. I won’t do what they say unless I know they lik e me. I exist on approval. I can get people to help by buttering them up. As soon as I hear flattery, I freeze up. I’m a sucker for a kind word. I let people know they can’t woo me by feeding my ego. I thrive on flattery. I never look for a wrong motive. I was taught to see only good qualities in people. Nobody can flatter me because I don’t respect their opinion.

The more indignant I be- come, the more likely I am to have my way. My father’s indignation is bound to show up in me. I get indignant when I see something I dislike. I don’t have to put up with something that’s wrong. I’m going to make sure people know exactly how I feel. People should get up in arms and change what they know is wrong. Inefficiency: I can’t take time to be careful. It makes me sick to try to be efficient. If I’ve got to be efficient, I’ll quit. My work keeps piling up on me, and I can’t get it done. If I’m too efficient, I’ll be out of a j ob. I don’t care how I do my work, just so it gets done. I’m just not an effi- cient person. I’m inefficient and it doesn’t hurt me. I leave efficiency to the experts. I take things as they come. Infection: Everything is poison to me. If I don’t make it bleed, I’ll get an infecti on. I’m forever catching some- thing.

I’ve got a bad spot inside that won’t heal. Inferiority Complex: I can’t be very smart or I wouldn’t have so many problem s. Everybody does a better job than I do. I’m never going to measure up to standards set by my parents. I just can’t do a good job. I’m a flop. Everybody has a low opinion of a person like me. I’m not bright. All my experience tells me I can never do anything well enough to attract favorable attention. If I ever get an outstanding result, it’s by accide nt. I’m inferior. I’m not as good as people assume I am. I have no real ability of any kind. I’ll never be able to equa l my brothers and sisters. Infidelity: I’ll do whatever it pleases me to do and ex- plain my actions to nobody. Af ter I have someone, I don’t want him. When my wife ignor es me, I’ll find my pleasures elsewhere. I can’t be true to anyone for long. I want new fields to conquer. I simply must maintain my contacts. When I stay close to home, I lose interest. As soon as he starts to criticize, I’ll find someone who appreciates me. I’m going to be a gay blade all my life. One is not enough to satisfy me. I’m a person who needs variety. Inside me there’s a powerful force I don’ t understand, and I have to do all the things it makes me do. Inflammation: I’m seething inside. It doesn’t take much to burn me up. I’ll die if I don’t get rid of this in- flammation. I feel as though my insides are on fire. I get inflamed over what I read in the newspapers. I break out in a rash when I think of politics. I have an inflammatory atti- tude, but only because I’m doing the Lord’s work. I try to keep my passions aroused as a driving force. Inflexibility: I’ll never give in.

Everybody is trying to influence me. No one is able to sur- vive without influence. I’ll us e my influence to get my way.

I have influenza ev ery winter. If a flu bug is around, I’m sure to get it. When I catch a cold, I’m in for a bad time. Flu epidemics get me down. I’ll probably die from flu just like my mother did. I can’t get away from my family’s tendency to get influenza. Cold weather bugs me. Inhibition: I’m sure I have few if any inhibitions. After three drinks I lose my inhibi tions. I get inhibited easily. When I do anything, I never let my inhibitions get in the way. I have to keep myself under control at all times. I’m afraid to say what I think. I haven’t the courage to do the things I want to do. I’d be in trouble all the time if I didn’t have a few inhibitions. I’m ne ver able to be myself. My inhibitions get in my wa y. Strangers inhibit me. In-laws: I’m always glad to see my wife’s relatives go home. No one can take the pl ace of my own family. Noth- ing I do pleases my in-laws.

My wife ought to take my side against them. I can take my in-laws only in very small doses. Among my husband’s relatives, I like myself best. Insanity: I’d look out of place in this world if I were sane. I don’t feel sure of anything. If I’m pushed far enough, I’ll go crazy. If I have to take any more orders, I’ll go nuts. My boss is driving me out of my mind. I can’t do anything right. I feel completely confused. My mind is muddled. I’m insanely jealous. I get attention by going out of control. No one is able to restrain me once I’ve made up my mind. If I go insane, they’ll ha ve to take care of me. I want to blank out every problem. Everybody’s crazy except me. Insects: I’m expected to treat everybody, even the bugs. Bugs make me sick. Bug bites poison me. I can’t stand spiders. Whenever I think of bugs, I get itchy. If I find an insect in my food, I’m sick for a week. I hate bugs. A caterpillar gives me the creeps. I’m scared to death of bugs. I can’t stand bugs in my house.

When I lose a friend, I can’t go on. I haven’t anybody to turn to for help. It would take a pile of money to make me feel secure. I’m not safe. 134"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Insomnia: I can’t ever get to sleep. As soon as I get into bed, my problems crowd into my mind. I think I should be working all the time.

All I do is turn and twist. Insults: I take every criticism as a personal affront. Nobody gets away with insulting me. I don’t dare murder anybody, but I sure can talk back. The person who insults me will get a bigger insult in re turn. I like to torture people with one insult after another. If I insult him sweetly, I can hurt him without giving him an excuse to hurt me. I’m crippled by the insults I’ve had to swallow. Integration: I don’t want to be take n in. I can’t stand to mix with people of other races. No one can force me to in- tegrate. I’ll never mingle with anyone I judge is below me. I’m not a good mixer. I want to choose the people that I rub elbows with. There is going to be trouble if they try to mix the races.

When I do something, I put everything I have into it. I don’t like to stint myself. The reason I do so much drinking is that my tensions need so much release. Interrupting: I’ve got to get a word in now and then. I have to cut in when I want attention. I won’t let anyone fin- ish his sentence. When I hear something mispronounced, I immediately correct it. I like to put in my two cents. I’ll throw a monkey wrench in the works. I can’t stand an inter- ruption from anyone. I say what I think the instant I think of it.

Intuition is a process of feminine reasoning that’s too complicated for males. I depend on intuition. When a hunch contradicts my reason, I go with the hunc h. Anybody who lives by hunches is a fool. The hunch has no place in science. It takes a ra- tional decision to impress me. I refuse to believe in hunches. Invalidism: Someday I’ll go to bed and let other people wait on me. I can’t help myself. I have to be sick to get their attention. I’ll just sit in a chair and make everybody do my work. I’ve waited on them long enough, so it is their turn now. The place I feel safest is in bed. The only time they’ll take care of me is when I’m sick in bed. I can’t take care of myself. I’m absolutely helpless. I am sick all the time. I’m going to take to my bed and see how she likes that. Irrationality: I can’t manage my thoughts. I’m losing my sanity. Things are moving so fast, I can’t help getting mixed up. I am going off the beam. Being rational is too much trouble. My mind keeps wandering. I don’t care how I sound. I can’t keep my thinki ng under control. My mind roams all over the place when I talk.

I have to wake people up to what’s happening. Nobody can get any sleep when I’m around. I like to start the day off with a bang. People can’t ignore you when you scream. The louder I am, the better I like it. I can make more noise than anybody. If I talk loud, everyone can hear. Love: I can’t live without love . Love makes up for any- thing. Love is the greatest emotion you can get when you grow up. I’m supposed to love everyone even when I don’t want to. Love is a pain. All’s fair in love and war. Falling in love started all my troubles. In the spring, people’s fancy lightly turns to thoughts of l ove. If anyone says anything against love, he’s crazy. Love makes the world go ’round.

I’m going to stir every- thing up. If the words don’t s ound right, then I can’t form them. I can’t make any sense out of this situation. Sensible people bother me. I can’t do anything the usual way.

Lumbago: I’m all bent over from this weight. I can’t straighten out my life. I’ve got to go to a warmer climate to get rid of this pain. Dampness always hits me in the lower back.

I can’t get any reli ef from my problems. I al- ways have to back down. Lumps: Nothing can stop me once I get started. I have to build myself up.

I’d lose my job if I didn’t lie once in a while. I can’t survive in the business world if I don’t lie occasionally. I’m used to lying and I can’t change at this late date. I can avoid punishment by making up lies. I like to i nvent stories. Lying around makes me nervous. I can lie my way out of a compromising situation. It’s more fun to lie than tell the truth. M Madness: Someday I’ll get so mad I’ll never be the same. I’m mad about guys. Loud noise drives me crazy. I’m so mad I could scream. If I fly into a rage, they’ll do anything to quiet me. When a nyone crosses me, I get so mad it leaves me exhausted. It makes me mad to be told there is something wrong with my thinking. I am too angry to speak.

Make-believe: I like to live in a dr eamworld. It’s fun to play make-believe. I have to act out everything. I like to pretend I’m someone else. It pains me to be who I am.

Being forced to live in a foreign land makes me sick. I have ups and downs. Malice: I don’t need any r eason for hurting someone. I’ll be spiteful to him before he does something to me. If I feel like doing something nasty I do it. If a person happens to get in my way, I do whatever I must to get rid of him. When I get an idea, I carry it out and pay no attention to the results. I like to make people suffer. I’m not the kind of person to be squeamish about what I do to other people. I’m a malicious gossip. Malnutrition: Nothing nourishes me. I never get enough food.

I like being marri ed. Marriage is the way to make sex legal. I’ll be a good husband and father and work all the time to educate the children. I’m going to be a good wife if it kills me. Martyr Complex: I suffer for my high ideals. I’m cru- cified just for trying to be right. Nobody has any respect for my convictions. I’m the one who gets imposed on because I’m the only one who doesn’t fight back. I mistreat me. Someday God will reward me for the suffering I’ve done at the hands of others.

My imagination plus what I think I see gives me a thrill. I get a thrill out of looking at what I’m not supposed to see. No one lets me look around home. I like to look when people are not aware that I’m looki ng. I ought to see everything before I die. Perfection: I won’t consider anyt hing less than perfect in myself or my family. If a thing isn’t perf ect, it’s no good. It makes me sick to have anyone see my imperfections. I’ll make everything perfect. I have to be right. Nothing is per- fect in this world. When I ma ke anything that’s not perfect, I throw it out. I’m perfect in their eyes. I’m a perfect exam- ple of politeness. I’m a perfectionist. Pernicious Anemia: I’ve got bad blood, and the quicker I get rid of it the be tter. I haven’t got enough blood to keep going. My life’s blood is being drained out of me by my relatives. I’m never going to be a red-blooded American. I’d like to die and be an angel. I despise the blood I inherited from my mo ther. My blood is no thicker 178"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"than water. There won’t be any blood for them to suck out of me after they’ve drained me dry. Perplexity: Things are too deep for me. I get perplexed all the time. I don’t understand half of what is happening. Nobody could solve my problems. Everything is puzzling for me. I can’t figure out what is expected. The state that I am in makes me perplexed. This is too much for me. I don’t know what’s coming next. Trying to figure out this life is too hard. I don’t see how I can know which way I should go. I can’t figure out what to do next. I don’t see how I can keep going. Persecution Complex: Everyone’s against me. He keeps taking pokes at me. Nobody understands me. I am the victim of a plot. Everybody’ s out to get me. My family likes to see me suffer. The whol e world is out to defeat me. Everyone’s talking about me. If I’m going to be like Jesus, I must suffer persecution. I’ll suffer in silence. My teachers are trying to persecute me. Persistence: No matter what happens, I won’t stop. I’ll persist if it kills me. I’m sure to succeed if I persist. I don’t have enough sense to quit. I’ll persist until they give in. The best way is to be persiste nt. If I don’t persist, I won’t reach my goals. Persistence gets the job done even if you don’t know how to do it. People notice you if you’re persis- tent. The only way to reach a lofty objective is to persist. I haven’t enough sense to know when I’m licked. Perspiring: I have to sweat out every difficult problem. I perspire when the heat’s on. It helps me to work up a sweat. As soon as somethin g goes wrong, I get hot under the collar. I’m always dripping wet. The harder I work, the more I sweat. I have to get al l the poisons out of my sys- tem. When I’m frightened I break into a sweat. I drain my- self dry for them and get no than ks. I have to sweat for all I 179"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"earn. Anybody who perspires a lot will be healthy. I drink a great deal too much. Perversity: I insist on getting my own way. When somebody tells me what to do, I do something else. I’ll prove I have a devil in me. I won’t let them order me around. Nobody can tell me what to do. I’m not going to do anything right. I’m going to be my own boss. Nobody can tell me what is right. I’ll neve r do anything they want me to do. It makes me happy to see them rant and rave. Pessimism: I’ll never be a success at anything. I always fail at the thing I want most. I can never do anything right. Very few of my decisions turn out right. I don’t see how to make my life improve. I may as well crawl in a hole and pull the top in over me. I mi ght as well not try because nothing I do pleases him. I’ll never get anywhere. Just when I think I’ll get ahead, my hopes are dashed. I’m hope- less. My thinking is bogged down. Pets: Dogs terrify me. Barking dogs drive me nuts. I feel bad when I think of lost animals getting no care. I’m sick and tired of working for this animal. When I get mad, I can take it out on my pet. I was raised a pet. It breaks my heart to see an animal abused. I like animals, but when I’m around them, my asthma acts up. When I grow up, I’m go- ing to have all the pets I pleas e. I can’t stand to be alone with nothing to pet. I can’t be happy unless I have a pet to cuddle and care for. Petting: I was raised to pet. I’m going to learn just what petting feels like. I’m going to try it without going the whole way. As I find more ways , I like it more. After all, it’s only nature. If I don’t do it, he’ll think I’m square. It’ll be all right for me this time. Everybody does it. This is na- ture at its best. I’ ll pet in the dark and no one will know. I 180"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"want to be petted like a kitten. You aren’t popular if you don’t pet. I’d do anything to be popular. Philandering: I play the entire field. I’m a big tomcat. Variety is the spice of life. I won’t be fenced in. I can’t set- tle down. Men are polygamous. I’ll never stay with one person. I’m going to try everything. I want to share myself. I have to keep moving. I won’t try to restrain myself. My ideas just don’t fit the common standard of morality. I’ll bet everybody else does it w ho gets the opportunity. I’m going to do all the things my father did. I’m going to let my lower nature have its way wh en it looks safe. Nobody is going to be aware of what’s going on. I’m no angel and I can’t act like one. Phlebitis: When someone hurts me, it goes through me like a knife. I’m blocked at every turn and it gives me a pain. Everything I do is in the same vein. I work and work but I’m blocked in the end. All my work is in vain. I’m all clogged up. I need a break. When I get in trouble, I know things are going to get hot. Something has to open up soon. I’m entirely blocked. Phobias: Fire really scares me. I’m scared to death of water. If I get closed in agai n, I’ll never break clear. I won’t tolerate pettiness. I can’t stand small places. I’ve got to get back as quick as possible. Unless I see a light somewhere, I can’t sleep. Someday when I’m up in a tall building, I’ll jump off. I’ll die if I am rest rained. My fears overcome my good sense. Pimples: When spring breaks ou t, I blossom, too. The badness shows up on me. I love to pick on something. Every time I get upset, I get pi mples. Things are coming to a head. I’ll find some way of getting noticed. I’m sore all over. Everything wrong with me always shows in my face. 181"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"When I eat sweets, I get more pimples. I’ve got to be like all the other kids. I’m facing a bumpy future. Pity: I feel sorry for myself. I deserve to be pitied after all I’ve been through. They exp ect my pity all the time. Everyone pities you when you ar e poor. If you can’t help someone, at least you can pity him. I’d like everyone to show me some pity. I have to pity those who have less. No one is going to pity me if I can help it. If people knew my troubles, they would pity me. Self -pity is better than pity by others. I want someone who will pity me and let me lean on him. Plagiarism: I can steal anything an d get away with it. Nobody is able to protect an idea. I have a right to help my- self to things I need. Others ’ ideas are better than mine. What’s yours is mine. No one can prove I stole it if I change it. I like to steal ideas and alter them so that I can get praised for them. Steali ng from many sources is re- search. The commandment about stealing has nothing to do with ideas. I can steal ideas from anybody without getting caught. After all, there is nothing new under the sun. Play: It’s more fun to play than to work. I’ll never take my life seriously. Everything seems like play. Once I’m grown, I won’t be able to play. I have to play all the time or she’ll ask me to do chores. I never learned how to play. I make play out of everything I do. I can work only so long, then I take time out to play. I can’t be pinned down. If you don’t learn to play when you are young, you can’t learn later. Pleasing: I keep doing the things I think others will like. I have a hard time pleasing anyone. Nothing pleases me. I like to do things that please me. The more I please others, the better off I am. I try to be just what he wants. If I please my mother, she’ll be nice to me.

Pleurisy: I can’t get my breath except in painful gulps. I would rather die than suffe r this way. Each breath is a painful effort. Just when I think I am getting a chance, someone knifes me. Life is too painful to keep going on. I can’t get this off my chest. I think this pain might be the end of me. I’m bound not to say wh at they want me to. This painful situation will keep me home and out of trouble. Pneumonia: I’ll keep everything to myself if it kills me. I’m up to my neck in troubles. I don’t see my way out. I can’t get this to come up. All my troubles settle on my chest. I’m filled up inside. I am drowning in my own spit. I can’t make myself clear. My failures knock the breath out of me. I hope I choke. Polio: I want a very long rest. Everything is at a stand- still in my life. I like it this way. I’m not going to let any- one else get something I don’t have. I’d like someone else to do my work.

I have so many burdens I can’t hold my head up. I always do the opposite to what she tells me. I’ll walk the way I please. My troubles weigh me down, a nd I can’t stan d thinking about them. Nobody is going to order me around. They pushed me down so hard I’ll ne ver stand up to them ever again. I look smaller if I slouch. I’m trying to be very in- conspicuous. I’m not strong e nough to hold up my head. I can’t get that monkey off my back. Pouting: When somebody hurts my feelings, I pout. I’ll show them when I’m not happy. When they scold me, they’ll be sorry. I’ll make people see I’m annoyed. I am going to get my own way. When I show my feelings, they won’t force me. I’ll show I’m unhappy. I pout like a baby. I’m going to stick out my lips whenever I please. I can get my way if I pout. I’ll make them think I’m about ready to cry. Poverty: I’d do anything to keep from being poverty- stricken. No matter how much money I have, it isn’t enough. I’ve always lived in poverty, and I assume I always will. When poverty comes in the door, love goes out the window. I can’t make ends meet with what I earn. I have to struggle for whatever I get, a nd it isn’t worth it. I’ll never be able to have what I want. I can’t win. Practicality: I have to be realistic at all times. It’s no fun to be practical. It pays to be practical. I have to be prac- tical about spending money. I al ways keep my feet on the ground. The practical way is the only way. If it’s practical, it’s safe. It’s dangerous if it is n’t practical. I’ve got to be 184"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"practical to make ends meet.

Practice is a waste of time. If I don’t prac tice, I’ll never be a success. Practice makes perfect. I’ll practice when I want to but not when I’m forced. The more I practice, the worse I get. I need hours of practice to succeed. I don’t have the patience to practice. I’ll practice forever. I hate to practice. Praise: Praise is the one thing I work for. I have to know I’m appreciated. I do twice as much when I’m praised. I like to have a pat on the back. When I’m praised, I do better work. If I praise pe ople, they’ll like me. Praise goes to my head. There’s no use doing anything if I’m not praised for it. I’ve got to k eep telling people how good they are so they’ll do their best. I hate to try unless people show appreciation. I won’t praise a ny man unless he praises me. I hate people who are stingy with their praise. Prayer: I have to tell God what I need. Prayer is my only salvation. I always pray if I want something special. Prayer is something I turn to when I’m in trouble. I don’t believe in prayer. I can’t pray. God never answers my prayers. Prayer soothes my soul. If I don’t go to church, I can’t expect God to listen. Praying accomplishes nothing. Praying is a sign of weakness. I can solve my problems by myself. The whole idea of pray ing is primitive. I won’t tol- erate superstition in my life. My mother prays for me. I put God to the test by prayi ng, and God didn’t respond. Preference: I have to express my preferences. I like to pick and choose.

I can put it off until later. I’ll do exactly as I please. If I know somebody is in a hurry, I deliberately force him to wait. Nothing is important enough to do right away. If I wait long enough, I can get out of doing it. I w on’t do a thing until somebody makes me. I just can’t get myself started. I’m a procrastinator. There’s no real use in rushing.

I do th ings that are wrong, but for me, they’re all right. I know it’ s not right to cheat, but if I can beat the government out of tax money, that’s not cheat- ing. I know it’s wrong to lie, but whenever I say what’s right, she punishes me. I ne ver do anything really wrong. It’s their fault if I have to do what they don’t like.

I don’t feel lik e getting rid of all my reac- tions. I have to react. I can’t control my reactions. All my reactions serve a purpose. My every action brings an equal and opposite reaction I don’t ex pect. People react automati- cally like machines. If I didn’t react, I’d have to bottle up my emotional pressure.

I’m going to prove reality wrong every chance I get. Reasoning: I have great respect for my reasoning pow- ers. When I do anything, I have to reason it through first.

I have a vio- lent nature. Life is nothing but one violent confrontation after another. I’m going to die a violent death. I live by the code of the jungle. When I get mad I get violent. Nothing is ever accomplished without viol ence. When things displease me I blow up. My activities are based on violence. Once I make up my mind to be viol ent, nobody can control me. 256"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"Virus Infection: I get everything everyone else has. I have to have the unusual. Bugs bring me all sorts of trou- ble. I like bugs. Virus infections are hard on me. Every time I get a fever, I’m sure it’s a virus. Each new infection lays me low. If I get tired and rundown, I’ll be sure to get a vi- rus. I get what my friends ha ve. I am very good at catching cold. My immune system can’t handle viruses anymore. Vision: I can’t see anything in this world for me. I don’t want to see anything ugly. I take a dim view of what is going on all over the earth. My whole life is out of focus. The situation I’m in is too frightening for me to look at. I can’t see any future in my job. If I were nearly blind, they wouldn’t scold me for being clumsy. I’ve spent my years looking for truth without ever finding it. I take after my mother who had bad vision. I don’ t see my way clear to do anything. If I don’t look, I won’ t see. There is no use look- ing for what I can’t see. I’d like to get to the stage where I see no evil. Visions: I don’t believe in a spiritual sense. The more I try, the less I can visualize. I can believe no more than what I have experienced. I can’t s ee a thing in my mind. Visions are the bunk. I can’t do any of the things I really most want to do. I think vision s are spooky. Saints get visions but I’m not a saint. I can’t picture a th ing. The idea of visions is scary. I want nothing to do with hallucinations. A thing has to be down on paper before I’ll look at it. Only schizo- phrenics have visions. I’m a person of vision. Vocation: I put my career ahead of everything else. I’m married to my job. My job mean s more to me than my mar- riage. I can’t do a job that doe sn’t suit me. The most impor- tant thing in my life is my vocation. I’m not going to be tied down to my job. I can’t d ecide on the ri ght vocation. My vocation is the only important part of my life. My fa- 257"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"ther selected my job, and I don’ t like it. If I can’t do what I like I’ll do nothing. Voice: I have no voice. If I’m going to work like a man, I’ll sound like one too. My voi ce is my bad luck. I can’t control my volume. I’ll neve r have a voice around here. When I’m emotional my voice cracks. My voice in the government is my most prized possession. If I lose my voice, I don’t have to take a stand. I get a deep voice when I get tired. My voice never counts. Vomiting: If I see someone getting sick, I also get sick. I have to bring everything up. In order to please her, I’d have to spill out my guts. The sight of blood makes me barf. I’ll get rid of everything so I can start fres h. I have to bring up everything I don’t like. The smell in a hospital makes me ill. When I eat too much, I throw up. A dirty house makes me sick in my stomach. I must bring up eve- rything to be safe. Vulgarity: I like to say things that make their hair curl. I want to sound like my boss. I’m going to say the things that make me sound like a big shot. People like me when I’m down-to-earth. I’m dirty and I don’t care who knows it. I know nothing but the seamy side of life. I can’t have fun without being vulgar. I have to act tough. I haven’t learned to control my tongue. I have a dirty mind. I’m vulgar when it gets me my way. W Walleyes: I try to keep my eye on everyone at once. I must see everything. Things never remain in the same old spot with me. I have to look at everybody I talk to. I can’t make my eyes behave as they should. Nothing can get out- side my vision. My eyes keep darting back and forth. I 258"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"can’t let my eyes remain idle. I need eyes in the back of my head. To get anywhere, I must travel along two different paths at once. Wanting: I’ll do the things I want to do. I want for nothing. Nobody wants me. I just want to get my way. I see no reason why I shouldn’t satisfy my wants if I can. I want more than I have. My wants are simple. I’ll get what I want by wanting. I can want ha rder than anybody I know. I’m always wanting what I can’t ha ve. I won’t be deprived of my wants. I want what I want when I want it. I never get the things I want. I can’t stop my habit of wanting things. I have been wanting all my life. All I want is everything, and I’ll get it. I want more all the time. War: If I ever go to war, I won’t come back the same. I get paralyzed thinking about a nother war. War frightens the life out of me. If a war comes, I’ll be left alone. A war gives people good jobs. I’ll never be able to see why we have wars. The thought of wa r makes me depressed. I’m deathly afraid of the bombs. I wish we would have a war so we’d know where we stand. Th e constant threat of war keeps my nerves on edge. I’ll be glad when wars are no more. Warts: If I pick up a toad, I’ll get warts. My hands are full of lumps. I’m going to have a wart on my chin like my mother. I’m a worrywart. I’ll grow all my own things. I’m going to have something I can pick at. I’ve got to have eve- rything other people have. A ll my bumps come up to the surface. All our family has wart s. I have to get my bumps the hard way. My troubles are always little ones. Washing: I don’t care how dirty I am. I hate to wash. It’s too much trouble to wash, especially behind my ears. If I don’t get clean I’ll be scolded. If I don’t wash my neck, I’ll have ring around the collar. If I don’t scrub until I dam- 259"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"age the skin, I won’t get clea n. I’ll keep washing all the time. When I grow up, I’ll neve r wash. If I wash my face often enough, I’ll be beautif ul. Every twenty years the world gets washed down in blood. Wastefulness: I can’t afford to wa ste a thing. I’m wast- ing away. I’ll waste my life if I want to. I’m careless about money. I’m wasteful and I can ’t stop being wasteful. I’m forced to be wasteful by the system. The more I waste, the better I like it. I can’t cons erve on anything. I can’t be happy if I have to be careful a ll the time. I have so much I can afford to waste it. I won’t try to be sparing of anything. I’ve got nothing better to do with my life. Wavering: I can’t quite make up my mind. My mind is always in a dither. I’m never su re where to turn. I have to keep going back and forth. I’m neither here nor there. I have to be sure to get on the side of the winning team. My mind keeps vacillating. I’ll refrain from making any defi- nite decision. I’m deathly afra id of making a mistake. It’s hard for me to make a deci sion. I can be popular by staying on the fence. I like to keep people guessing. Weakness: Sickness takes all my strength. I’m a weak character. Weakness is a female thing. Everybody grows weaker as he grows older. I’ve got a weakness for women. They won’t expect me to work if I’m weak. When I get up to talk, my knees get weak. I’m as weak as a kitten. My diet makes me weak. My resolve weakens when I see the fun other people have. Laughter leaves me weak. My weak- nesses will be the death of me . I’m always weak about say- ing no. Wealth: Someday I’m going to be rich. The only thing that’s important is to become financially independent. I’ll pile up enough money to earn respect. After I make my pile, I’ll think about bei ng unselfish. If I have enough 260"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"money, I can afford to be sick. Money is my god. No amount of money could really sa tisfy me. I give 10% to the church so I’ll get more prosperous. I’ve got a wealth of problems. Weariness: By evening weariness descends on me like a cloak. If I work all day, I’m cer tain to be tired at night. I grow weary of hearing people co mplain. I’m so weary of it all I could lie down and die. I’m tired of living. I’m weary in well-doing. I get weary of lis tening to people’s hard luck stories. Motherhood is a wearis ome job. I get sick and tired of their bickering. I get a lot of pity when I’m worn out. When I’m weary, I have to go to bed. Much study is a wea- riness of the flesh. Weather: After a long hard wint er, I need time to re- cover. As soon as the weather gets warm, I get restless. I decide how I feel by the weathe r. I can’t breathe when it’s excessively hot and humid. Wh en there’s dampness in the air my aches and pains come back. Gloomy weather gets me down. It scares me when bad weather sets in. Talking about the weather is always sa fe. I always get sick when there’s a change in the weather. I can weather any storm. Weeping: Funerals make me weep. I have to shed some tears to prove I’m sorry. I’m a crybaby. When I’m sore I weep. I’m a born weeper. My bladder is behind my eyes. When I’m criticized it makes me burst into tears. I cry eas- ily. I have to cry my eyes out before I get attention. It’s a woman’s privilege to weep. Sad music makes me weepy. I cry at sad movies. It doesn’t take much to turn on my wa- terworks. I started weeping at birth, and I haven’t been able to stop. Wet Blanket: I won’t let anyone have fun at my ex- pense. Wet blankets give me a chill. What other people think is fun looks stupid to me.

Somebody always tries to curb me when I’m having a high old time. If I don’t stop him he’ll get into real trouble. I’m the only one who displays any brains in this cr azy crowd. I’ll put a damper on everybody’s fun. I hate to see anyone get too happy. Whining: I never get my way unless I whine. I have to keep begging and whining all the time. I can avoid work if I whine and complain. No body pays attention to me until I start to whine. If I don’t whin e, they’ll forget I’m here. I can make him give me my wa y by whining. If I whine, she’ll do anything to shut me up. I want to annoy them all I can. If I whine, they’ll leave me alone. I’m a born whiner. Widow: Widows are fair game. I won’t be the same without a husband. I can’t face the world alone. A widow doesn’t have a chance. Guys take advantage of a widow. Everybody feels sorry for a widow. Nobody cares to in- clude a widow. A widow is always the odd person. I’ll never get invited to parties. I’m all alone in this world. I’m never going to make this adjustment. I won’t live alone. I’ll have to find somebody else. I hate being a widow. Wife: My wife has to wait on me hand and foot. My wife will never tell me what to do. A wife should be a credit to her mate. A wife is what your sweetheart becomes after you marry. I’ll be a perfect wife. I’m afraid I didn’t get the right woman. My wife is my crutch, and I couldn’t get along without her. My wife operates me like a machine. She never does a thing right. No w that I have a wife, I need an excuse for whatever I say or do. My wife can’t tell me what to do. She’ll do as I say. I’ll get the upper hand. My wife can’t stop my fun. Willfulness: I am the master of my fate. I’ll make cer- tain that I get what I want. I’m going to impose my will on 262"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"others. I’m a person who decides what he wants and goes after it. I try to use willpower. I’ve got to be very strong- minded. I’ll change everything around to satisfy me. I’m going to show everybody who’s the boss. I’m going to sat- isfy my motives. I am the captain of my soul and I won’t let them forget it. Wisdom: Wisdom is for the aged. I’m wise. A word to the wise is sufficient. The ol der I get the wiser I’ll become. I never show any wisdom in my decisions. I’m completely lacking in wisdom. I have the wisdom of Solomon. I’m a lot wiser than anybody recognizes. I like to spout words of wisdom. I’ll get wise when I’m as old as my father. I’m a wise guy. I’m not going to rely on anybody’s wisdom if it doesn’t give me what I want. Wisecracking: I love to raise a laugh somehow. I’ll show people I’m smart. I hate wisecrackers. I have to wise- crack to protect myself. It’s fun to make people laugh. I have to wisecrack to be a big shot. I have to crack wise. I must keep proving to everybody I’ve got a great sense of humor. I have to top my brother. I’m expected to be funny. Wisecracking makes me feel lik e I’m one of the in crowd. If I ever shut up I’d lose my place. Women: You can’t argue with a woman. Women get all the advantages. I love being a woman. I can’t trust women. I am going to put women out of my life. I’m a woman-hater. I owe my su ccess to a woman. If you ever give in to a woman, you’ll live to rue the day. I’ll never suit my woman. No woman is going to outsmart me. Women cause all my trouble on the job. I have to be polite to women. Women act as if they’re superior. I love females. Women talk too much. I’ll never trust any woman enough to marry. I go crazy around the ladies. 263"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"Won’tfulness: When I turn on my won’t, I can’t be budged. Nobody can make me do what I decide not to do. I won’t be a part of anything I don’t consider right. I won’t give up even if it kills me. I’ll knock aside anyone who tries to tell me how to live. I won’t cooperate. Nobody will get me to change. I won’t let a woman tell me what to do. I will not follow orders. I won’t conform even if they try to force me. I like to be stubbor n. I’m the balkiest person alive. Woolgathering: My mind likes to go its own way. I am apart from reality. I don’t like to try to control my thinking. I do a lot of fantasizing when I’m alone, and I can’t stop when I’m with people. My mind always wanders. I’m go- ing to escape to my dream world. I can’t keep my mind on any subject. My dreams are with me all day long. I’ll be a dreamer all my life. All I can do is use my imagination. I’m always chasing rainbows. Work: I have to keep working all the time. Nothing works out right for me. Work is something to skip when- ever possible. I hate work. If I can’t see results right away, I’ll quit. Work makes me sick. I’ll always have to work for a living. Work is never easy. Nobody works the way I do. Woman’s work is never done. I’ve worked my fingers to the bone and now I have arthritis. The more work I do, the less I accomplish. All work and no play makes me dull. I have to work all the time. Worms: I need something to help digest my food. I’ll get worms if I eat pork. I feel itchy as if there’s something crawling around inside me. If I get mad enough, I’ll eat worms. I’m a bookworm. I’m not going to miss out on a thing. I inch along each day like a worm. I feel wormy in- side. 264"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"Worry: When I have nothing else to do, I can always worry. I’m a worrywart. I’m worried sick about my mother. Worry is something I have to live with constantly. I have great concern for everyone. I worry all the time about what to do for single parents. My children are my biggest worry. If anyone tells me he doesn’t worry, I know he’s lying. My health always worries me. Once I start worrying, I can’t stop. I couldn’t get anything done without worrying. If I didn’t worry about money, I’d never do any work. I get my problems solved by worrying ov er them. If I didn’t worry, I’d be worried that something is wrong. Unless I’m worry- ing, I feel very guilty. Wrinkles: I’m trying to look as if I’m deeply con- cerned. The older I get, the more wrinkles I find. I can make myself look older if I wr inkle my forehead. As soon as I get into my 60’s, I’ll sh rivel. Working outdoors makes my face wrinkle. I’m a prune face. My face will never wrinkle because I’m just a big baby. When I screw up my face, I get their attention. Pe ople without wrinkles have dull personalities. As I age I look more and more like my mother. Wrongdoing: No matter what I do it’s wrong. Wrong- doing comes naturally to me. It ’s easier to be wrong than right. I’m afraid to be right; it’s more fun to be wrong. I’m never right. I’m going to be wrong for spite. I might as well be wrong as right. I’ll do as I please. If I take wrong action that’s my affair. I can’t be bothered whether I’m wrong if I get what I want. If I get up on the wrong side of the bed I’ll be a grouch all day. Wrongness: Everything keeps going wrong for me. Everybody’s wrong but me. I’ve been wrong all my life and she won’t let me forget it. The only way I get her atten- tion is to be naughty. Nothing I do turns out right. There is 265"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"no wrong way to do anything I want to do. Nobody can change his mistakes at my ag e. I’m more wrong than right. I always get out on the wrong side of the bed. I’ll never admit my wrongness. If there’s a wrong thing to say I’m sure to say it. Murphy’s law describes my life. Y Yearning: I yearn for things I can’t have. Yearning ex- asperates me. I yearn for new horizons. I yearn for the good old days. I have a burning desire to gain security. I can’t let go of old ideas. If I want something, I’m obsessed until I get it. My mind stays on a desi re to go back to where I was born. I always want to be where I’m not. I yearn for a place in the sun. I don’t know what makes me feel so driven to succeed. Yellow Jaundice: I’m yellow and I don’t care who knows it. This will make people notice me. I’m not going to try to hide my fear any l onger. I have to look the way I feel. I’m yellow inside and out. I’ve always wanted to change my color. I lead a colorful existence. I’m like a chameleon. I’m going to let them know I’m in trouble. Yielding: I always have to give in first. Unless I yield to his advances I’ll be sorry . I won’t yield even when I know I should. Getting a girl to yield is my biggest kick. If I yield I know he’ll talk. Ev eryone wants me to yield in some way. I know I won’t gain anything by holding out. I refuse to yield any ground under pressure. Yielding leaves me feeling guilty. In yielding I always win a victory. I’m the kind of person who yields bad fruit. Youthfulness: I’m too young for anything. If I looked older, I’d get a better job. My youthfulness is against me.
