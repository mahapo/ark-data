Be- cause the author could not find a publisher willing to go out on a limb for honesty and right action during that period, the manuscript was filed away among his voluminous pa- pers. Since his death in 1989, the manuscript has been given careful editing. Some obviously dated material was elimi- nated, but the principles of right behavior that he put into words are ageless. They are all preserved. Richard W. Wetherill, during his lifetime, was often de- scribed as a person who was sc ores of years ahead of his time. His associates and members of his research group think that his day has finally come. Increasingly it is be- coming fashionable to be honest and right. RIGHT IS MIGHT tells the reader how honesty and rightness are achieved in a person’s private and public life. It also describes the exciting developments in the lives of persons who are applying the formula for successful living explained in the pages that follow. ii"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Introduction A Message of Optimism and Hope Much is right in the world, but also much is wrong. This book is mostly concerned w ith what is wrong. It is not a book of criticism and condemnation. It is one of explana- tion, optimism and hope. It promotes the doctrine that we, as individuals, can save our world. It advocates procedures with which each person can start by improving the satisfac- tions and rewards of his own life. Little is wrong in the world except what is caused by people’s intentional or uninten tional misdeeds. True, there are occasional earthquakes, floods, windstorms or famine. But the seasons go along in reasonably orderly succession, and the vegetation renews itself each year without fail. That has been true in the past, and although the pattern may change at any time, it will presumably be true in the future. So it is clear that nature is not the culprit. Most of every- one’s suffering is caused by people. There is no use dodg- ing that basic fact. This book rests on certain a ssumptions that are widely accepted today. One of those assumptions is that society sadly needs relief from the wrongs caused by men. Another is that there cannot be the ne eded relief without a moral awakening that will open new channels of individual and mass thought, leading to a giga ntic swing in private and public opinion. Another is that th ere must be reliable yard- sticks and procedures for dia gnosing those ills, for prescrib- ing their cures, and for seeing that the cures are made effec- iii"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"tive. This book is one man’s effort to define those yard- sticks and procedures. Doubtless what follows will include much that is un- conventional. There is a reason for that. The reason is that the conventional procedures have not worked. They have led or allowed people to drift into what is now recognized as a critical and sorry estate . Even the modern and most advanced procedures have not stemmed the negative tide. The retrogression of recent years, in fact, suggests that many of those modern and most advanced procedures are negative in themselves. First, if conventional proce dures have not worked, what is needed is unconventional procedures. That necessarily means society needs procedures that are tried and proved effective but are not yet popular. It seems best to start with the problems that exist by reasoning first to their causes, then to their solutions. That is the approach that was used in the studies that led to this book. Some readers may conclude that this book advocates a sort of idealism that may be impossible to achieve, but such is not the case. My dictionary defines idealism as “seeing things as they should be instead of as they are.” That kind of idealism is necessary to check idealism against reality and note the differences. When you do that, what you get is the objective for a practical plan of action. To deride that use of idealism is to say that things should be as they are instead of as they should be, no matter how terribly wrong they are. By that line of r easoning, people excused feeding Christians to lions and sending Jews to death camps when it was fashionable. Obviously the long-term trend of humanity has been toward improvement. The light of truth has burned brightly in occasional spots on this earth and may be burning iv"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"brightly in unsuspected spots today. There have been many lost generations when, for th e most part, that light had burned dimly at best. We should not let this present genera- tion become one of those that is lost. Many persons think that present predicaments demand a mental and emotional housecl eaning all over the earth. We need a new system of reasoning that is different from what we have had. At least, we need new tools of reasoning that will change the answers we get in dealing with a con- siderable proportion of our basic problems. To accomplish that, human nature being what it is, we must also make certain that using those tools does not in- volve self-sacrifice on the part of those persons who use them. Few persons have demonstrated any willingness to advance humanity while retarding themselves, even when there is ultimate personal gain to be had as a result. There- fore, we need tools that will benefit the individual user be- fore they benefit humanity as a whole. This book will un- dertake the task of supplying those tools. Some of those tools may seem utterly new, but, in real- ity, there is little that is ne w about them. Nevertheless, in combination, they provide a set of keys that will unlock the deep, rich secrets of an enlightened life for every person who seriously uses them. Many persons will doubtless recognize in those tools the framework of a formula that is almost as old as re- corded history. Some of our sa ges have put portions of that formula into words. Religious writings are filled with such words. I feel that the formula represents what every enlightened person has long desi red to say and will be glad it is at last being said. Occasional enlightened persons will say that the basic tenets of that formula are so simple they are hardly worth v"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"mentioning. Except for the fact that they are so generally disregarded, that may be so. But perhaps we have got our- selves into trouble because so many have forsaken the ob- vious. Clearly, if that is true, the obvious must be retold to humanity. In searching for a formula that will solve people’s basic problems, we must find one that combines workability with simplicity. Often it is said that life has become too complicated to understand. It is not life that has become complicated, but rather, the mechanisms of life. Almost every new push- button device introduces new si mplicity into the process of living. So we normally leave the technicalities behind those push-buttons to the experts who devise, produce and ser- vice them. If we don’t get simple r living as a result, that is our fault. Perhaps it is true that our social problems have become too complicated for the layman to understand. But experi- ence has taught that, thus far, the experts have not acquired sufficient ability that we can entrust them with our social problems as we do our problems of electronic and me- chanical devices. An amateur social planner may feel that he can outdo the professionals, and, in importa nt respects, he can. It is only an occasional person who thinks he can fix his own television set better than an expert. Part of the reason may be that the amateur social planner detects flaws in the work of the experts, whereas the TV repairman quickly proves that he knows what he is doing. This book is not intended to be hard on the experts. We all recognize, as especially do th ey, that the social sciences have lagged far behind the phys ical sciences in the amount of research given them and in the results that research has vi"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"disclosed. One reason is that a person cannot patent and directly profit by the results of social research as he can in the electronic, mechanical, chemical and other physical fields. Consequently there is less incentive to support and conduct effective social resear ch programs. Another reason is that most of our research techniques were developed es- sentially to permit physical studies, and many of the basic research methods are ill-ada pted to nonphysical studies. There are other important reasons that cannot be given di- rect attention here. Clearly we need a vast simp lification of today’s broad social problems as faced by the average person if we expect to resolve them. The right formula will be seen to involve procedures that let people go on working and amusing themselves as they do now. It will, however, change their manner of working and playing. It will enrich their personal lives and, therefore, will be attractive to them. At the same time, it will get people out of the dilemmas that threaten to engulf them. I repeat, a purpose of this book is to supply that for- mula. It cannot be described briefl y, but I have tried to waste no words. The formula cannot be put into capsules and sold in the manner of popular drugs. It must be read and di- gested. Once a person grasps the formula, it is hard to imagine that he will fail to st art putting it to work. He will start having more opportunities, more rationality and more freedom from trouble. He will be the first to benefit. His success will be in proportion to his making the formula work, and it will work if those things he craves are right. Preparation of this book ha s involved certain troubles with our language. Many abstract words are used that often vii"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"mean different things to di fferent people. Moreover, our common nontechnical language contains no word to ex- press an exact meaning that is required. Sometimes that ne- cessitates detailed explanations to make intended meanings clear. In grasping those meanings, the common dictionary definition rather than a speci alized technical usage should always be assumed. There is only one problem that proved so difficult to solve that special expl anation is required. Repeatedly this book uses the term “average person.” That term is in disrepute, because it represents a statistical image that has no counterpart in real life. But it is a con- venient term if its meaning is understood as intended. There seems no recourse except to say that it is used in the gen- eral connotation of an earlie r day. It signifies the middle one third of our population w ho most nearly approximate what is average in relation to the quality under discussion. When that quality is negative, as is a specific form of dis- honesty, the quality will be considered common to both the middle and lower thirds of our population. When it is posi- tive, as is a specific form of honesty, the quality will be considered common to both the middle and upper thirds. In either case, the boundaries represent only a rough approxi- mation. Thus, in every case, the term will ascribe a quality to roughly two thirds of our population—important because they constitute a working majority who can do much to control society’s destiny. The term average person is still a statistical monstrosity, but defi ning and using it in the fore- going sense will save confusion later on. viii"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Contents I NTRODUCTION : A M ESSAGE OF O PTIMISM AND H OPE .......

People don’t need to be told that there is nefarious plotting among na- tions, that governments are in fested with graft and corrup- tion, that business .and industry are honeycombed with sharp practices, and that all too many individuals are out for themselves first, last, and all the time—to the detriment of others. Nor do people need to be told that they face many serious environmental problems and dilemmas that are not being resolved. Too few people recognize any connection between their wrongs and the troubles they cause. Among all the lessons taught by history, the most im- portant is that the forces of right ultimately triumph in every long-continued struggle. The forces of wrong are doomed to ultimate extinction, as is evident in the lives of every past oppressor and tyrant who ever trod this earth. A person needs to be afraid only to the extent that he is wrong. People instinctively know it—at least people who are not blinded by cupidity, excessive ambition or other destructive drives. Just as would-be conquerors have striven to gain con- trol by aggressive action, so have innumerable men and women chosen dishonest, immoral shortcuts to their objec- tives, trying to stack the cards in their favor in the game of life. But right has a way of ultimately succeeding as well as a definite short-term and immediate value. The easiest way to gain true advant age is to be right. 2"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"This book will advance and pursue the thesis that most of society’s serious problems and dilemmas have arisen from persistent wrongs practiced by a majority of people. It will not be concerned with th e rights and wrongs of smok- ing, drinking, gambling or sex; it will seldom deal with fine distinctions of any sort. Instead, it will deal with the sort of wrongs that virtually every unbiased and objective observer would agree at once are bot h wrong and indefensible. It will show that behind almost every wrong there are one or more persons who caused and support it. It will show that almost every wrong is an expression of inten- tional or unintentional dishonest y on the part of those per- sons who caused and support it. It will show that masses of people are dishonest, both i ndividually and collectively, and that there is dishonesty on virtually every level of soci- ety. It will show that society needs to practice fundamental honesty in its activities as a prelude to revolutionizing hu- man thought. It will show that until people establish their thinking on a new plane of honesty their basic problems cannot be solved. It will be establis hed that honesty is the way to correct our human problems and that there is no other. Thus this book will pinpoint the exact nature of a de- lusion that has captured the minds of billio ns of people, some who think there is nothing amiss and others who know that something is amiss but do not know what causes their fear and frustration. It will e xplain how to correct delusions people do no t know they have. It will demonstrate that the result will not only be the elimination of trouble but also the openi ng of hitherto unsuspected ho- rizons of spectacular opportunity. It will describe the tools needed to spread the good word everywhere. 3"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"If you believe in honesty not me rely as an ideal but as a daily reality, you are going to like this book. If you believe that it is wrong to lie, steal, cheat, neglect your responsibili- ties or hurt your fellow men, th is book contains no basic assertion you will resent. But if you are like the average person, you had better prepare your self for a few shocks. At first, some of those shocks may be unsettling. Have the courage to look facts in the face. If you do, you are going to get several interesting a nd profitable surprises. Clearly, I am dealing with a touchy subject. If you want to know how touchy it is, select almost any person you know and accuse him of being dishonest. I am going to show that the majority of people are ha- bitually dishonest in severa l unnoticed but important ways. I am going to show that many are dishonest on purpose for selfish gain and others for reasons they consider little short of holy. And I am going to show that those who are dishon- est only for what they consider good reasons are just as dishonest and detrimental to human welfare as those who are dishonest only for selfish gain. For a person keenly conscious of his own past mistakes, it has taken courage to make th e assertions you have been reading and more courage to make the assertions to come. But be assured that I do not feel cocky about them, because I learned what happens when you make mistakes by the simple process of making them. Sometimes I think I have learned from almost every mistake that a person can make, and often it has taken more th an one repetition to make the lesson clear. Nevertheless, I ha ve determined to write about what I have learned. When certain individuals read these pages, they may be reminded of the scriptural injunction, “Let him who is 4"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"without sin cast the first stone .” I don’t propose to cast any stones, but I do propose to tell the truth. If Diogenes were here with his lantern today, I think he would find as few honest people as he found in ancient Greece. In the twenty-three centuries since Diogenes, people have made great progress in dealing with physical things. They have learned to collect innumerable natural resources and convert them for human use. They have given the pub- lic all manner of products and devices—even developed a nuclear arsenal. Most of th e progress has occurred in the physical realm while in the nonphysical realm, the rate of development is much less significant. Most people have not even solved the problems of or dinary dealings with one an- other, but as many people are saying, we had better solve them if we intend to survive. That people may be able to solve them, there is consid- erable hope. To do it, what is most urgently needed is a greater proportion of incorrupt ible people. As those incor- ruptible people gain influe nce, everybody’s troubles will diminish. And when the facts get abroad, incorruptible people are likely to turn up on all sides. There are good rea- sons for expecting that to happen. Most persons would agree th at every individual wrong is likely to be detrimental to society as a whole and that a world in which individual good damages the common good does not make sense. This book will make clear that every wrong is detrimental to the individual who causes and sup- ports it. It will make clear that resort to widespread honesty will bring most of the universal troubles to an abrupt halt. More important, it will make clear that resort to honesty on the part of one individual a nywhere will do much to stop trouble for him, without regard to what is done by others 5"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"whom he cannot influence or control. There is just one sort of person for whom that will not be true. He is a person whose wrongs have already done irrevocable damage from which he cannot escape. It cannot be denied that ther e is great evil occurring in the world. Examples of obvious wrong are publicized every day, on every level of society everywhere. To miss seeing those wrongs, a person would have to close his eyes to most current events. That is a sad commentary on human affairs, but people may as well face the facts. Otherwise their minds are certain to be th rown off the paths of logic, and no more time should be wasted in confusion. The average person (by average person I mean the ma- jority of all persons) has made so many compromises with his personal integrity that he hardly knows what real integ- rity is. So persistent have people’s dishonest habits become that they usually go unrecognized. They have become em- bodied in our systems of public , private and business life. There is no need to name specific people. It is enough to define the four general gr oups that people fall into: 1. Those who like and grow fat on an existing devious system. (This book will show that they are not so fortunate as they assume.) 2. Those who feel caught in the system’s vicious toils and consider it practic al to go along. (When the sys- tem is changed, they’ll heave a sigh of relief.) 3. Those who have broad moral scruples and try not to compromise them. (They represent vital landmarks pointing to a better world.) 4. Those who are too blind to know what is going on. (Of- ten they give their support to members of the first group.) Whether a person likes it or not, that is the situation; and the evidence is that the first group, the di shonest element, is in the ascendant. 6"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Now that I have left no doubt regarding my opinion of society’s mass depravity, let us turn to another side of the picture. Perhaps you noticed that the foregoing information is presented quite dispassionately. Customarily displays of dishonesty and wrong are denounc ed indignantly. But in- dignation serves no useful purpose. As will be shown, it is only another form of wrong. In addition, the person who is wrong is in trouble. He needs he lp. He needs it a great deal more than he needs condemnation and criticism. It is not rational to imagine that a person would pur- posefully get himself into trouble. That would be like a per- son’s banging his head against a stone wall in the belief that such conduct improves his well-being. When a person understands why people get into trouble, it generates more sympathy than bitterness and makes him feel inclined to- ward help rather than recrimination. There are no bad people. There are only people who make bad mistakes. Many of those who cause our most serious troubles are really well-meaning individua ls who are quite unintention- ally dishonest in ways they do not suspect. Some are know- ingly dishonest in ways that they justify by means of ra- tionalizations and noble motives. It is true that there are others who, without conscience , are out for th emselves; but it all adds up to the same result. They are making trouble for themselves and for others. When they understand what they are doing, they will stop. I am optimistic enough to think that the change will come in the present generation. Certainly it is not too much to hope that we can reverse the trend. There are a thousand concepts I should like to present all at once, but they will have to be presented in sequence. 7"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"What I am trying to do is to build a case that should al- ter the mass thinking of the human race, and to do that, it is necessary to proceed in small steps. It causes me to make various statements that, at first, a person may be inclined to challenge, but there is no other way. If he follows the steps laid out in this book, he will pe rceive the path to a better life. Some persons may think I am expecting too much. It must be admitted that altering the mass thinking of the hu- man race will take a bit of doing, and to accomplish it, I will need a great deal of help from the people who thought- fully read this book. As they understand, I predict their help will be wholehearted and enthusiastic. In addition to those who read this book, there are many individuals who, in their own way, have made substantial contributions to the general movement of which this book will become a part. There are leaders and writers who are both vocal and articulate in advancing the cause of right. Usually their remarks are tied in with specific topics relat- ing to problems that have been mishandled. Often they are just as outspoken as I. They should be pleased to learn that the basic component of all prob lems is being presented so that solution for antisocial behavior of all kinds can be made known. This book is not for ever ybody. There are plenty of people who will not read it. There are some who will read a few pages and toss the book as ide. There are others who will read straight through what most directly applies to them without realizing the connection. But I think there will be enough who digest its contents and put those con- tents to practical use. They w ill apply what they learn in their own lives and be better off for it. Many of them will 8"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"exert influence in the lives of others and thus spread im- provement far afield. If there are just ten thous and of those people, that would be enough to start a movement that could change the world. In the process, their so rt of thinking would gain con- trol of the world’s business. That would benefit everyone. But it would benefit the te n thousand people first. I count on a vast amount of help from women, because many of them are in a position to influence at least one man. That they will do it in many cases, I have no doubt. A woman could hardly find a surer way of getting her hus- band or male friends advanced in their careers and earn- ings. Thus she can combine a moral crusade with practical considerations—and benefit in both respects. I also expect much help from the younger generation, although it will doubtless take time for their influence to make itself impressive. There are two reasons why their help is vital. One, their minds are not as cluttered by misin- formation and prejudice that must be corrected and dis- lodged. The other reason is that soon they will be running our affairs. A few associates advised me, “Write to the person with a ten-year-old mind. He is th e person you must persuade.” That approach could not be right. The person with a ten- year-old mind is not reached by writing to him. Nor can I simplify a complicated presentation to suit his powers of absorption. But that is an acad emic matter, because the av- erage ten-year-old can’t or w on’t read anything important or serious even if put into his hand. After eliminating the people who can’t or won’t read anything serious and important, there are perhaps twenty- five per cent of the population left—unless I am too opti- mistic. That group contains the people of influence who set 9"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"much of the pattern for what is accepted by others. The bulk of the job must be done th rough them if it is to be done at all. As movement toward right thinking gains mo- mentum, that influential group will be infused with ideas and plans of approach that will make their influence effec- tive. By practical experience, I have learned that the lowest worker in the economic scale (including the person who reads least) is receptive to these ideas when skillfully pre- sented. I have learned that he is often more quickly recep- tive than the person of greater emotional and intellectual maturity. He will usually not be a problem so long as there is someone willing and able to talk to him. That I can say with the voice of experience. Techniques of dealing with those persons will be embodied in chapters to come, afford- ing help to teachers, clergymen, business and industrial ex- ecutives, personnel managers and others in a position to make their leadership effective. Often it is said that nobody can change human nature. Perhaps not, but we can ch ange people’s thinking, and through that, their behavior can be changed. For sufficient reason, their thinking can be changed almost at once—on a mass scale, too. There are two ways to cha nge people’s thinking. One is by persuasion, and the other is by force. Force is not a suit- able tool. I am reminded of the quotation “A man con- vinced against his will is of th e same opinion st ill.” There is a kind of force though that doe s get results. But first, I should like to discuss persuasion, because that is the basic approach of this book. The simp lest kind of persuasion re- sults from setting a good example. The person who does thereby gives himself a bette r foundation for the stronger kinds of persuasion. 10"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"The purpose of persuasion is to induce volun tary action. Therefore, persuasion must offer attraction toward per- sonal advantage and gain or toward the opportunity to avoid trouble and loss. When those rewards are held forth and the other person is convinced, directly or indirectly, that the action suggested will give them to him, he will surely cooperate. Succeeding chapters will define the important rewards of honesty. Those rewards can briefly be indicated by say- ing that the person who understands and applies the princi- ples described in this book will open unimagined opportu- nities. He will have a perfect formula for achievement and success. He will understand that right will eventually pre- vail. Succeeding chapters will also define the penalties of dishonesty—even unintentional or so-called noble dishon- esty. It could be said that th e person who rejects this infor- mation will thus deny himself his best opportunity to grow and prosper. Such a person inevitably remains his own worst enemy. Only as he becomes convinced that he has reduced his effectiveness and that his troubles are mainly his own fault will he start seeking improvement. Such are the available t ools of persuasion. Properly used, they have almost the e ffect of force. By analogy, let me cite a practical example. If you were standing on a ra ilroad track and a friend were to shout, “A train is coming!” you would accept his word and get off. If the shout came from a stranger, you would probably still respond even though you had no basis for judging his veracity. But suppose you didn’t know that you were standing on a track? Y ou would instinctively look for the track and then for th e train. When you saw them no 11"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"matter who provided the warni ng, friend or foe, you would get off the track. The victim of wrong thinking is in much that position. As the message unfolds, he will see the vision that can change his life, and he will seek that change. Just in case you need it as badly as I did, I am going to shout, “A TRAIN IS COMING!” In effect, I am going to describe another place to jump to when the danger in which society is living is seen by th e reader who realizes that there is no other choice. I w ill show how that danger gener- ates a negative force that can be replaced by a dynamic positive force that can make him invulnerable, take the ef- fort out of his exertions, a nd enable him to do what he wants to do—to the exclusion of what he does not want to do. Earlier I promised to discuss how to change people’s thinking by force. The easy way to force a change in another person’s thinking is to deprive him of a desired opportunity unless or until that change is made. Often that will force him to change through sheer economic necessity. It is a delicate procedure, both to avoid unfai rness and to a ssure a success- ful outcome, and there are many ways to apply it. A person can withdraw his patronage from a store, withhold his vote from a candidate or refuse to carry out dishonest instruc- tions of his employer. It is true that his action counts as only one factor, but it is surpri sing how often that factor is decisive. Much dishonesty succeeds only because it is supported and protected by people in surrounding positions. Only mass dishonesty could perpetuate many of those situations, and some of them will be easy to break up by use of honest techniques to be described. Within any group, you need 12"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"convert only enough people to alter the balance of power, and it is usually easy to gain recruits for any clearly stated, sound moral cause. There are situations in which nobody’s decision is valid except your own. That is the case when the other fellow wants an advantage or opportunity that only you are in a position to withhold or provide. Another way to force a change is to start direct compe- tition with the dishonest person. When that competition is made effective, the result will be one of two things: either the dishonest person will change his thinking, or he will be replaced. In many practical s ituations, the implication of force is clear. Whether the average person has ever considered it, it is far easier to compete successfu lly with the person who is on the wrong track than with the person who is not— provided you are on the right track yourself. Besides when a person gets the habit of doing it that way, he discovers that direct competition, even in a capitalist economy, is no longer a necessary part of success. All right purposes can be served without it. The person likely to resist that approach, it seems to me, is one who has convictions for which he has repeatedly gone on record. Perhaps he has interests to protect. In such a case, he may be almost irrevocably prejudiced against the logic herein employed. We can hope only to surround the prejudiced person with patterns of influence and example that will demon- strate a better way of life. If need be, influence and exam- ple can be supplemented with stronger devices such as withdrawal of support. When a large number of persons actually participate in a movement of that sort, whether or- ganized or spontaneous, those who refuse to change will inevitably ensure their own downfall. 13"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"It will be demonstrated that no aggressive action is needed to secure a victory for the forces of right. And in the meantime, those who have provided the patterns of good influence and example will find that their lives have flow- ered as a result.

But above all, people were slaves to th e need for a source of continu- ing income. What is said and done, in large measure, is dic- tated by that need. It was a little like discovering I was an anteater and could not get a m eal except by grubbing in the dirt. It didn’t seem right. I wanted freedom from such slavery. So I started look- ing for someone who had turned the trick. I didn ’t find him. Lacking opportunity to copy a successful practitioner, I de- cided to strike out for myself. At first, I got into a certain amount of confusion, but as a re sult, I also learned how to be free by embracing a surprisingly simple concept. If you make up your mind to it, you can do what you want to do, and you can do it to the exclusion of doing what you don’t want to do. It has been many years since I first phrased that con- cept. To say that I have lived by it ever since would not be truthful, but I have come a great deal closer to it than you might expect. The effort to do it led to an astonishing se- quence of discoveries. One of the first discoveries was that there are strings at- tached to the concept. A person cannot constitute himself or herself sole arbiter of his de stiny without regard for the consequences of his behavior in the lives of others. I am not 15"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"referring to legal entanglement s. I am talking about entan- glements that are essentially moral, and why it is necessary to avoid them. Avoiding moral entanglements, it turned out, puts no restrictions on anybody’s freedom . Instead, the techniques of avoiding moral entanglement s are exactly the techniques that make genuine freedom possible. Those techniques are embodied in a simple formula that I gradually learned to use, and its implications go far beyond the welfare of the individual. To apply that fo rmula, you need common sense rather than unquestioning faith. When you turn the switch th at feeds power to a light bulb, it goes on. You don’t have to understand what you are doing, you don’t have to know a nything about electricity, you don’t have to have faith in the result. The light goes on nevertheless. You take the re sult for granted because you have seen it happen so often. Besides, you know you get the same result if you turn the switch by accident. You don’t get conceited over your prowess in producing light, because you know that a monkey could turn the switch and get the same result. Your only advantage over the monkey, perhaps, is that you know th e location of the switch and what it is for. In the next pages, I am going to locate a switch that will produce enlightenment and give you the advantages that are presently benefiting only a fortunate few. It has often been said that on this earth there is all that is needed to enjoy a veritable Garden of Eden, where peo- ple could live replete with happiness and freedom from want. That is true. There is an easily mastered formula by which so fortunate an estate could be achieved, and it is the formula we are about to disc uss. The wonder is that so 16"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"many centuries have passed while mankind has neglected to bring that formula into focus and see it for what it is. The safety of everybody depends on adoption of that formula by the masses. That may be hard to induce. But whether it is finally induced or not, the average person can create a private Garden of Ed en, replete with happiness and freedom from want. The formula is the key. Only by adopting that formula can the individual make himself free and invulnerable . Only thus does a person make a proper contribution to freedom and invulnerability for society as a whole. In other words, by opening the door to abundance for himself, he also opens the door—if only a crack—to abundance for all other fellow beings. Do not be surprised that the formula is simple, for sim- plicity is a natural characteristic of every basic concept that has motivated humanity. Here are the words of the formula that can transform your life: Always think, say and do what is right. Refuse to think, say or do what is wrong. To a certain few people, that formula comes as no sur- prise. And I’ll tell you something about those people. In a world filled with conflict and tribulation, those people function calmly. They aren’t seeking peace of mind be- cause they have it. Nor does it resemble a quiet somnolence that comes from ignoring the troubles of society and pre- tending that all’s well with th e world. Those people are re- alists. They know what is going wrong, and they are doing something constructive about it. They want to act instead of relax; they want to work instead of play; they want to meet life head on because th eir skills, energies and ingenuity are constantly challenged by the opportunities and events of life. 17"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"There is something else about those people. They are doing exactly what they want to do. No vocational troubles plague them. Whatever they attempt works out. Their lives open before them and present them with every opportunity they need. They never have to serve contradictory purposes or interests, never have to be two places at once, never suf- fer from anxiety or depression—not while living in accord with that formula. But tell that formula to the average person, and you may be rebuffed. At once, a dozen objections ar e likely to tumble forth. “But I always do the right th ing,” one may say. He does? Then he is different from al most any person I have ever met. As a matter of sober fact , I am not sure that I know anybody who can clearly disti nguish between right and wrong in all decisions. Why that is, I shall discuss in chap- ters to come. In the light of that knowledge, I shall explain exactly what a person has to do to develop the ability to make unerring right choices. “Sometimes it doesn’t pay to do the right thing,” an- other may say. The simple fact is that doing the right thing always pays, and that the only way to get into trouble is to do the wrong thing. The stat ement that wrong action can lead to right results, or that right action can lead to wrong results is a contradiction in te rms, although it is true that right action handled in a wr ong way can cause trouble be- cause an element of wrong was introduced. To say that it doesn’t pay to do the right thing is to say that right is not e xpedient. That is untrue. Except under a common distortion of thought, th e terms right and expedi- ent are identical in meaning. The reason there are two words to describe the same c oncept is that so many persons are unaware of the truth. For it is a truth that is known only 18"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"to persons who are spiritually enlightened, and it is a truth everybody should learn. There will be skeptics who dispute the basic assertion that literal right is always e xpedient. Those skeptics tend to pride themselves on their intelligence and on their applica- tion of logic to all their prob lems. The next point should give them pause. The value of logic is that it affords a system of exact reasoning. Perhaps the most widely understood device of logic is the syllogism: All men are mortal; I am a man; therefore, I am mortal. Here is a syllogism that puts my point across: What is right, according to William James is what works; what works, according to the dictionary, is expedi- ent; therefore what is right is expedient. Who dares to say that right is wrong? Who could deny that right is expedient? I have met people who have done both. Logical reasoning, I have learned by experience, is not enough to satisfy dissenters to truth. They labor the question interminably, often in resentment and sometimes in outright anger. Yet some of those people have great in- fluence, and in proportion to their influence, they are a threat to society’s welfare. When logic leads those people into a trap that refutes their preconceived notions, they forsake logic and resort to emotion. They are reluctant to accept what they have never considered, because it is inconsistent with many misguided events of their past. Have th ey no confidence in logic, the science of exact reasoning? Have they more confidence in the prejudiced promptings of their emotions? Unfortu- nately, they have! Even in the commonest parlance, what is not expedient is wrong. It cannot work, so it cannot be right. Therefore, 19"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"only what is expedient is righ t. In any parlance, only what is expedient can work. If it works, it cannot be wrong. Therefore, only what is expedient is right. Thus we come out with the same conclusions: What is right cannot be inexpedient or wrong. A dozen past compromises with right may spring to the mind of any reasonably honest pe rson. All logic to the con- trary, he considers those co mpromises to be expedient. How can he justify them? It is not enough to say that he cannot. He may insist on his poi nt despite all the contradic- tions of logic, so he must be given no room for doubt. If possible, he must be convince d. In view of the history of human affairs, that may not be easy—even though he knows that the basic tenets of our broad social policies have brought human affairs to th eir present sorry estate. Always do the right thing. Ri ght action leads to right results. Wrong action leads to wrong results. Right action cannot lead to wrong results. Wrong action cannot lead to right results. Right can never contradict proper duty; all are identical by definition. These statements are clear and distinct, inarguable and obvious; it is strange that any person would question them. Here I should like to say why I have emphasized the es- tablishment of what most peopl e instinctively know. If you are puzzled that I have so heav ily stressed the identity be- tween right and expedienc y, let me explain why. For many years I have been bur sting with the ideas that fill these pages and have discussed them with a wide vari- ety of people. Most of them ha ve resentfully disagreed that right is always expedient. On no other subject have I en- countered such frequent and serious skepticism. 20"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"There are many who have rejected the truth in the past, are rejecting it today and, unless we put a stop to their folly, will reject it in the future—to our cost as well as theirs. Occasionally, however, I discovered somebody who raised his eyebrows in surprise that the point should be ex- pressed at all. “I thought ev erybody knew that,” he would say. “Why all the fuss about anything so obvious?” The sharp distinction between the two groups, at first, was puzzling. But those who ag reed provided stimulation, while those who didn’t provided a challenge. The stimula- tion kept me on the job, and the challenge taught me the arguments that must be met. Point by point, I have learned the objections so that today I think I can answer them all. In recent years I have tested the answers by trying them on the skeptics, and those skeptics are just as prevalent now as when I started. But there is a big difference. The skeptics do not remain skeptical. Instea d, they say, “I hope you get that story across. It’s exactly what this sick society needs.” Of course, there are some w ho will resist the whole phi- losophy of these pages. I do not envy them the positions they must take to make thei r arguments appear convincing or even to state them. In effect, those people must work from the assumptions that wrong is right and that right is wrong. That is as impossible as proving that up is down. Their hairsplitting ingenuity may capture temporary adher- ents, but their logic is specious and cannot endure. Many persons may have to condition their thinking be- fore they can accept all that fo llows. But there is evidence that the only person who will reject the basic tenets is the one who consciously thinks it is expedient and profitable to do what is wrong and has adopted a policy to that effect. If such people there be, their howls may go up to heaven, but those howls will be aimed in the wrong direc- 21"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"tion. So, perhaps, will be the people who utter them unless they mend their ways. There may be skeptics, but nobody can justify wrong to an intelligent listener except when that listener is a fellow conspirator. The case for right stands up under the most rigorous and logical analysis. To present that case demands no oversimplification of a complicated set of ideals hedged in by if’s, and’s, and but’s. The presentation is based on irrefutable truth. Adoption of any opposite assumption as the basis of action is crime against humanity. Only because that crime is so perpetually committed have human affairs come to their present perilous state. Skeptics there may be, but the day will come when it is realized that the principle of absolute right is the crux of man’s relation to man, and also of man’s relation to God. At the time of this publica tion, it may be difficult to recognize the person who espouses absolute right. He sel- dom talks about it. He has learned that people who hear his theories expounded silently accuse him of claims to saintli- ness and judge him critically. He has learned people seldom realize his behavior is controll ed by recognition of a natural law. Instead they may decide he is trying to get away with something. It is a popular condemnation of the literal moralist that he “sees the world in black and white; to him there are no grays.” Recognize that gray is compounded of black and white, and the comparison becomes more valid. Let us return to our consideration of the objections that arise when the formula for successful living is put into words. “Right and wrong are relative qualities,” someone may say. “One thing is more right but less wrong than another. 22"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Often a thing is partly wrong a nd partly right. There is sel- dom a clear-cut distinction.” Under analysis a person discove rs that situations consist of elements, some of which are wrong and others right. If he sorts out and examines t hose elements, truth is easily separated from error. Some tasks of sorting are more diffi- cult than others, but only because they are more compli- cated. They have more elements; therefore, they take more time to analyze, or perhaps the individual lacks knowledge of how to deal with them. Often it is hard to collect all the pertinent facts. Some facts must be filled in by speculation, and here it is impor- tant that the speculation be done by a scrupul ous person. If those analyses are continued long enough, there finally emerges a clear pattern of distinctions between right and wrong. Those who act before a clear pattern emerges are the persons whose irresponsibility is causing much of soci- ety’s trouble. There are other characteristic objections, and there is an answer to each. “What is right is what is generally sanc- tioned.” If approval is the crit erion, moral va lues could be fixed by flexible whims. “What is right is determined by custom.” If we are to judge right by what people do, there would be no point in seeki ng improvement. “Right depends on your viewpoint and interests.” If that were true, the end justifies the means. “What is right in this place will be wrong in another.” Then do it he re but not there. “What is right today will be wrong tomorrow.” Then do it today only. “What is right for one person will be wrong for an- other.” Let him do it for whom it is right but not for others. Such are the comments that have greeted the simple formula: Always think, say, and do what is right. Refuse to think, say, or do what is wrong. People who make those 23"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"comments are living in clouds of delusion. Right is clear and distinct. It is a positive quality. There is no such thing as an indefinite dividing line. There are only people who do not perceive the truth, and that is why humanity does not have a Garden of Eden today. As children, all of us learne d to handle the problems of ordinary arithmetic. There are vital lessons in arithmetic that we generally overlook. Firs t, the easy way to solve a problem necessitates breaking it down into its simple and obvious steps. Second, each step constitutes a minor prob- lem in itself to which there is an easy answer. Third, when you put together the right answers to the minor problems, you get the right answer to the problem as a whole. The procedure can be proved by a dding a column of figures; every competent person who adds the same column gets exactly the same answer. In handling the more comp licated problems of life, people often are too negligen t to be thorough. They use slipshod methods that leave too much to the imagination. Instead of confining themselves to the facts, they let emo- tions creep in. They get answers they want rather than an- swers that are right. When someone challenges them, they feel obligated to prove the correctness of their decisions, quibbling and splitting hairs. For the problem that is really broken down into its es- sential elements, the hair-splitting can be skipped, because every distinction be tween right and wrong becomes easy. It can be made by the person di rectly involved or by any ob- server in possession of the f acts. In rational moments prac- tically everybody realizes that. If you want to experiment, select an adult at random and question his ability to tell right from wrong. If he isn’t too angry to talk, he will give you a stiff argument. 24"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The fact is that everybody has the ability to choose what is right, and he knows it. But it may also be true that he is often confused. In his confusion he may erect elabo- rate defenses for his wrong deci sions. In effect, he may say to himself, “This is the time when it is right to do the wrong thing.” The temptation to form such a concept should in- stantly show that he is off the track—provided he knows anything about logic. I have introduced the word temptation on purpose, for every normal person can tell right from wrong except when temptation somehow undermines his reason. Let him learn to recognize and resist tempta tion. Let him learn the areas in which he is competent to make sound moral choices and then extend those areas. That will give him more freedom, because he won’t get into troubl e. But he should be given no more responsibility than his existing stage of moral ma- turity enables him to manage for the common good, espe- cially if he becomes one of our elected officials. Then eve- rybody will have more freedom. 25"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 There Is Never an Exception The topic really being discussed is the basic morality of society. People tend to think of morality as something con- nected with the rights and wrongs of sex, which may be part of the general theme, but morality consists of recog- nizing and doing what is right and recognizing and refus- ing to do what is wrong. Morality is often thought to be very complicated, but in reality, it is not. Much of the average person’s morality reflects what his parents and teachers taught hi m as a child. Some reflects his religious training. In my family that involved a Chris- tian Sunday school and churc h. Many people are somehow prejudiced against the morality of scripture, but I have no- ticed that they are usually the ones who have spent the least time reading it. If it will co mfort them, I didn’t learn these points from scripture. I learned them from life. Only later did I find that the Bible apparently contains them all— which ought to comfort the others. It is worth noting that thus far in this country neither Christianity nor any other re ligion is being practiced on a national scale. When it is pr acticed by individuals, they find it a source of infinite sa tisfaction and an excellent guide to behavior. By their conduct, those persons have raised our average standards of behavior. At this writing, people seem inclined to re gulate their lives by reference to surveys. For example, there is the Kinsey Report, touted as a scie ntific treatise for the eyes of doctors, but advertised and sold in large volume to the gen- 26"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"eral public. Many magazine ar ticles and books were written about that report. The burde n of the Report’s findings seems to be that since people are sinful about sex perhaps our standards of behavior shoul d be lowered to match what people actually do. That is an amazing reaction until you remember that there are multitudes of people who make no effort to distinguish between right and wrong. Suppose the average person has sinned? Does that jus- tify sin? Suppose the Kinsey Report had investigated steal- ing rather than sex behavior? What person could claim that he has never stolen, even onc e? Is the average person, therefore, a thief? Should we lower our standards to sanc- tion thievery? By the same reasoning, should religion be discarded because it teaches a morality that few people practice? What is needed is a realisti c approach that is based on intelligent choices rather than on desire. People need to sharpen their ability to make distinctions between right and wrong and to do it from the facts of any given situation without reference to surveys that report what others do. The question of how to sepa rate right from wrong can be made very complicated, and it can also be simplified. It will be shown that most of life’s problems are free from fine distinctions of any sort. For example, consider the s ubject of truth. For all prac- tical purposes, a true statement is on e in accord with the facts. The answer to one plus one is two. Any other answer is wrong. Now consider the matter of right and wrong as ex- pressed in human behavior. A little wrong is as wrong as a big wrong, because ei- ther wrong is absolutely wrong. In the field of human rela- tions, for example, it is as wrong to chop off a man’s finger 27"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"without just cause as it is to chop off his head. It is as wrong to steal one cent as to steal a million dollars. One wrong may lead to more serious consequences than another and thus entail greater responsibility; nevertheless, any wrong is wrong. Follow the same reasoning a bit further, and put it in reverse. If it is wrong to chop off a man’s head or his finger without just cause, th e reason is that the act unjustly injures him. Therefore, it is as wrong (though less serious) to sub- tract from his happiness, to add to his misery, to injure his health, to reduce the esteem in which he is held by others, or even to cause him annoyan ce, again assuming that the action is taken without ju st cause. Moreover, a wrong caused by negligence is as wrong as one caused by inten- tion. Thus it is clear that pe ople should not conduct them- selves irresponsibly to the detriment of others. It is also clear, when a person measures the foregoing principles against the daily behavior of any randomly chosen persons, he finds that there are few of them who live in conformity with the principle of absolute right. When the mass of peo- ple learn of this principle a nd start guiding themselves by it, we will have a vastly better world. The preceding chapter gave a formula that constitutes a virtually infallible rule of human behavior. That formula has a moral and religious aspect as well as one that is prac- tical. Nearly every civilized religion preaches some form of the Golden Rule, but religion too often is summed up in that precept: “Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.” The same may be said of the whole problem of human relations. “Why read a book on how to succeed with 28"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"people?” I have been asked. “When you have the Golden Rule, you have the whole thing.” Do you? Without belittling one jot or tittle of that piece of scrip- tural guidance, I should like to suggest that Jesus had a great deal more to talk about than the Golden Rule. So did the Prophets. So does anyone w ho seriously addresses the subject today. It might reasonably be said that the Golden Rule is a sort of abridged rule-of-thumb for everyday guidance of the person who cannot remember th e other details. Even as such, it is often forgotten, and among those who do not for- get, it is often abused. Consider the following: “Did you consider it right to fix that man’s traffic ticket?” I once asked a small-time politi- cian. “Sure I did,” he said. “I t’s just a matter of applying the Golden Rule. That’s what I’d want him to do for me. Besides, it’s practical. In a few weeks I’m going to want him to vote right. That’s how we keep the party in power!” Maybe that politician thought he was virtuous. Maybe he had his tongue in his cheek. Maybe he was just stupid. I don’t know. But I do know he was not practicing the scrip- tural Golden Rule. From the foregoing, it is eviden t that the Golden Rule is not an infallible guide to righ t behavior, at least, not by it- self. But it is both implied and included in the deeper ad- monition: think, say and do what is right; refuse to think, say and do what is wrong. That admonition could keep a person out of troubles he never suspected he was in. It would keep everybody out of trouble if everybody would properly apply it. “Work on the politicians first,” people say. But that evades a basic fact. The right place for every person to be- 29"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"gin is with himself. He who does is the first to benefit. And now I am going to make several statements that need not be accepted because you assume that I am a reliable reporter, but because you see the reality of their correctness. There is one method by which to check: Apply to yourself the pro- cedure I shall describe. Application provides the evi- dence—the reality. Let us talk about several pe rsons who were in trouble. We should recognize that trouble , especially serious trou- ble, is usually compounded of big and little wrongs and mistakes. Past offenses, provide d they did not cause irrevo- cable damage, are less importa nt than the wrongs and mis- takes to come. They should be prevented. Each of those persons in trouble was given a formula. The conversation was something like this: “There is a way out of your dilemma. You can find it in a surprisingly short time. Nobody can give it to you; you must find it for yourself. If you do what I ask you to do and refuse to do what I ask you to avoid, your life will start im- proving at once. “Doubtless you will be astonished by the changes that will occur. Your problems will be solved. Your ills will be relieved. Your attitude w ill improve. Your energy and courage will grow and enable you to meet and master every task. Somehow life will start to organize itself. But don’t take my word for it. Apply the formula, and judge for your- self. “Whatever your aims in life, don’t let them dominate your thinking. Let your mind be dominated by these words: Think, say and do what is right. Refuse to think, say or do what is wrong.” When it is a person’s intent to live by that formula if he is in doubt, he should take time to ponder. He should not 30"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"act until he know s; then doubt will vani sh. Events will open before him, his problems will work out, and his needs will be met. He will easily do what earlier seemed impossible, because any task done right is easy to perform. He will re- alize that fatigue, negative emotion, controversy and unre- warding struggle—such things as these—are signs of fric- tion. They show that he is forcing his way against resis- tance. Our conversation continued, “A s a result of all this, you can expect a succession of events that look like miracles. You may not be able to connect a desirable result with its true cause and may recognize the cause only by the fact that no such miraculous happenings had previously oc- curred in your life. You may recognize the cause because I tell you that the same thing has already happened for others to whom I have given this same formula. For them, such happenings are now routine. They can be for you, too.” What sort of results? Those who needed money sud- denly received it, usually from an unexpected source. Those who suffered from conflict and abuse at the hands of others found their relationships suddenly altered for the bet- ter. Those who couldn’t sleep at night found rest. Those whose lives were tangled in to complexities beyond belief discovered that their problems started untangling of their own accord, seemingly with little or no direct attention. I know of no person who did not get a spectacular result by faithfully applying the foregoing formula: Think, say and do what is right; refuse to think, say or do what is wrong. The logic behind those examples will take time to un- fold, but I shall describe a basic element of that logic for anyone whose skepticism demands immediate evidence. Consider a common situation faced by almost everybody. 31"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Each person has a more or less conscious group of ob- jectives that dominate his life, and they change from time to time. Persons who must earn a livelihood likely include among their objectives a desire to advance their careers. Often that becomes a person’s dominating motive—held forth because society respects it. But what sins are commit- ted in the name of that motive! The person’s definitions of right and wrong somehow base themselves on what advances or retards his or her ca- reer. At once, the person suffers a degree of moral blind- ness that blanks out part of his intelligence. The very fac- ulty that must be used to chart a successful course and ad- vance his career loses part of its usefulness. Automatically competitors become enemies, he compromises his con- science to suit an unprincipled superior, he seeks unfair ad- vantages that will bring prom otion, perhaps he shields the talents of others who may outshine him, and he may in- dulge in numerous other shar p practices often considered smart. Those are some of the reasons why there are so many persons whose daily lives contradict the teachings of their religion, why so many persons have enemies, and why people fall into errors they cannot understand. When a person suddenly develops the courage to face life honestly, even as an experi ment, all those troubles start correcting themselves. A new light shines in his eyes, a new spring rises in his ste p, a new buoyancy results from the shedding of conscious and unconscious burdens. The rewards are beyond belief. Why? Because the right thing to do is the expedient thing to do. And a successful life free from trouble is the reward of right thinking and right ac- tion. 32"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Of all the vital faculties available to man, the ability to base one’s life on the principl e of absolute right is the ability that underlies all the rest. The person who bases his life on that principle finds th at all things are added unto him. Always think, say and do the right thing. That sentence is a thousand times more complicated than may seem evident at first. For twenty years it has been one of my basic pursuits to lear n why people fall into error. As a result, I am convinced that what I have learned is of vital consequence to each and every person. However, in another sense, that sentence is also a thou- sand times simpler than it may appear. While at times the ability to distinguish right from wrong may seem the most difficult of human virtues to ac quire, it is easy to apply. In- deed, its application becomes quite natural and instinctive, effortless and exhilarating to the person who can cut through all the superficialities of a complicated life and de- cide, “Hereafter, I shall inte ntionally do what is right!” Anyone who makes that decision—and means it—gets a series of additional surprises. So does everybody who knows him. Consider a specific situation. Can you imagine yourself facing a crisis unlike any that you have previously encountered and yet find yourself re- sponding instantly to what th e occasion requires? If you think about it, you will realize that you have done precisely that, more than once. What strange power came to your rescue? Surely not your education nor your experience. Education is for what can be expected; experience is for what has happened be- fore. You didn’t have time to th ink it through. You just had time to do the right thing. A nd, if you kept your head, you 33"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"did it. Probably you didn’t think much of the accomplish- ment then nor realize what had happened. Despite any contradictory opini ons, in a crisis, the indi- vidual is able to focus his attention onto the foundations of absolute right and solve the problem that confronts him. It happens on occasion to practically everybody. There is nothing strange or remarkable a bout it. What is strange is that people give so little recognition to this phenomenon. What is stranger is that this great power, so readily avail- able in a crisis, is absent in our less crucial moments. There is a reason for that. In a moment of crisis, one does not have time to plan. A person proceeds on instinct or not at all. In that moment of crisis, so long as one keeps his head, right thought and right action are almost synonymous. When there is time to calcu- late every move, all sorts of choices may arise. Is it not true that what a person can do in a crisis he can also do when no crisis exists? What is there in a crisis to elevate his abilities to such heights? It is evident that a crisis tends to draw on an individ- ual’s highest energies, give him strength, and produce a quick concentration of faculties. But it does more. Because it demands immediate action, it excludes a great deal of extraneous thought. It keeps hi m from exploring his fears and undermining his faith in himself and his capabilities. It keeps him from considering hi s selfish interests, seeing how he can squeeze the maximum profit out of his act, or otherwise confusing his inherent knowledge of what is right. It holds his faculties on the only consideration that counts—the consideration of wh at will resolve the crisis— what is right. And it makes him forget the extent to which society reveres education, experience, ambition and de- 34"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"tailed planning. Not that ther e is anything wrong with those things when appropriate. What all this means is that, in a crisis, the importance of right action becomes dominant. It dwarfs all other issues. And what this also means is that when no crisis exists, thought and action are too of ten conducted without the same foundation of safety. By our very opportunity to be thorough, we often defeat ourselves. We do it by forsaking our reference to absolute right. How often have you gone through crucial situations that taxed you to the utmost? How often have you succeeded instinctively in doing the right th ing? There is a feel to that experience, an emotional sens ation not so much of moral rectitude as of safety and i nvulnerability. You can get that feel in every act of life. When you have it, no matter how great your problem, you will come through to success. It would be foolhardy to suggest that you gain that feel by the process of confronting you rself with a series of cri- ses just to test yourself. I disc overed there is an artificiality about such testing that thro ws thinking off the track. Be- sides, there are enough crises in daily life to afford all the opportunity needed. What is learned from meetin g crises directly with a cool head and instinctive resort to right is that much of our daily planning is confusing and unnecessary. Pursue that knowledge far enough, and a person dis- covers that he can enter almost any situation, however complicated, and quickly produce order. He can do it with- out advance planning and almost without effort. He discov- ers that often it is easier to do it than to refrain from doing it. That is an exciting pi ece of knowledge—perhaps the most exciting a person can possess. 35"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 People Really Want To Be Right It is a popular saying that the average person is honest. That saying is generally accepted and believed and passed along from one person to anot her as though it were true. I first heard it from a teacher who said, “Many people say that the average person is dis honest. Don’t believe it. If you do, you will become a cynic. If you expect him to do the right thing, he usually will.” Of all my childhood lessons, that has been one of the most disastrous. For years I took it literally, and the story of what it cost is too long to tell here. I can say that it led me into two traps. One, I assumed that dishonest people were honest, which enabled them to delude me. Second, I adopted certain false standard s, which had the effect of teaching me to do what I saw others doing who later proved to be dishonest. I no longer believe that statem ent; it wasn’t true thirty years ago, and it isn’t true today. Perhaps you think I have become the cynic my teacher predicted. No, I have confiden ce in the basic integrity of the average person. In a sense, he is just as honest as my teacher said; yet, in another sense, he is decidedly dishon- est. You have to go very high on the ethical scale to find a person who lives by the principle of absolute right. The fact is that the average person is hone st part of the time, is nei- ther honest nor dishonest part of the time, and is dishonest the rest of the time. 36"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"What I realize today is that the average person has stan- dards of conduct that he is not willing to violate, so there are certain dishonest acts that he will not perform. He will not pick your pocket. He will not rob your house. Perhaps he will not falsify his income tax return nor lie under oath. He will not commit a dishonest offense that might land him in jail. But I am cynical e nough to believe that fear of jail is not what deters him. There is something deeper. The examples I have cited typify a string of offenses that are clearly against the la w, because they are almost universally regarded as dishonest and detrimental to the general welfare. But the averag e person has more than fear of jail to consider. He knows th at he has to get along with people and that he cannot unle ss he suits them reasonably well. He knows he cannot suit people if he disregards the almost universally accepted standards of decent behavior. He will not risk conviction in a court of law, but neither will he knowingly risk convicti on in the courts of public and private opinion. Therefore, he does not do what he knows his friends and associat es strongly disapprove of, even though the act violates no formal law. I shall show that such standards give him mu ch latitude in the direction of dishonesty and allow many dishonest policies to be prac- ticed and advocated quite generally. Fear of jail and of adverse public opinion seldom enter the average person’s mind. He has other deterrents that work before those fears have a chance to surface. Those other deterrents are his own pe rsonal standards of behavior. Those standards may go an inch beyond the law or a mile, but whatever they are, they ordinarily determine what the average person does or does not do. In a sense, fear of punishment under the law or at the hands of others is supplement ed by fear of punishment of 37"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"the wrongdoer by himself. That suggests a consideration of conscience. By discreet questioning, I have learned that many adults do not seriously acknowledge a conscience. They call it a superstition inherited from fo rebears. But conscience is there, and it works. If you doubt it, just suppose no member of the human race had a cons cience. What would life on this planet be like? Conscience has been likened to an imaginary inner compass by which a person finds the direction he should travel, much as a pilot might steer his ship. However, that likeness does not really de scribe the conscience. The person who follows his conscience knows that it is an instrument of infinite precis ion. In the opinion of its crit- ics, apparently their primary objection is that it is not scien- tific. “The conscience cannot be relied on,” said a scientist, “because its promptings are subjective.” Then he excused himself, remarking that he was hungry, and he hurried out to lunch. I wonder how he knew? Perhaps the lie detector affo rds the most objective sci- entific evidence that conscience really does exist. The lie detector measures physiological symptoms and translates them into evidence that can be read on a chart. It shows changes in such functions as respiration, perspiration and pulse rate. It verifies the great emotional burden a dishonest person must sustain. The burden springs out of the neces- sity to carry hidden lines of thought, representing the truth and his effort to conceal it. At the same time, he fabricates a spoken line of thought that is false. In the process his in- genuity is taxed, and he is bur dened with fear. At the same time, his excitement is increased. The whole performance is met with emotional resistance. You can call that resistance anything you choose. I call it conscience. 38"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Ordinarily conscience is not needed for deciding the proper direction of travel. No r is it a device for choosing between right and wrong. Those functions belong to the brain. I think conscience is an instrument for encouraging the person who knows what is right and wants to do it as well as an instrument for deterring or punishing the person who knows what is wrong but insists on doing it. And, because I hold that conscience is a vital human force, I am going to make the blunt assertion that ordinarily the average person does not invite the displeasur e of his conscience by doing what he knows is really wrong. Neither does he do it by failing to do what he knows is really right. At least, not unless he is first placed under great temptation. Temptation that is resisted strengthens character. Temp- tation that is not resisted erodes character. The person who ignores his conscience finds that over a period of time, it becomes desensitized—a characteristic malady of our age. The person who has allowed his conscience to become desensitized needs no thing more urgently than to embark on a program to sensitize it agai n. That is not difficult. It consists of listening for the right inner promptings and at- tempting to respond to them no matter where they lead. I never met a person who said he got into trouble by that procedure, but I have met many persons who were afraid to try it. In the foregoing, two functions of conscience were de- scribed, but there are more. Conscience tells a person to do what he knows is right, and it also tells him not to do what he knows is wrong. The person who uses his brain to distinguish between right and wrong thus charts his path of action. Soon he discovers unexplainable occasi ons when his conscience ex- 39"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"ceeds the foregoing functions and actually furnishes a guid- ing impulse on its own account. The person who has learned to receive those impulses has an inspired guide for perfect motivation. Anyone who does not know th at should withhold pass- ing judgment. I say that to give pause to the person who might otherwise persuade someone else to reject a correct idea. Rather than deride the truth, he would do well to start seeking and following inner guida nce. After he starts doing that, he collects evidence that is convincing. Medical therapists have desc ribed an emotional disease called overconscientiousness. It is not for me to say that there is no such disease, but some persons have used re- ports of it as justification for relaxing self-discipline. Be- fore relaxing, there is some point in speculating. Taking your troubles more seriously th an someone else thinks you should may indicate that natu re has selected you for ac- complishment. Isn’t it true that a person perfects his per- formance only by trying to perfect his performance? A person should not moderate the functioning of his conscience until he knows what he is doing. Unless a person has an actual emotional disease, he should try giving his consci ence complete freedom. He may discover that so-called overconscientiousness is noth- ing of the sort. The problem results from the individual’s resistance to his inner promptings. Let him recognize and act on those promptings and resistance will subside. Simul- taneously his life will flower and prosper. Sometimes a person thinks the promptings of con- science are contradictory. That just indicates he has not learned to sort out right from wrong. The person whose employer insists that he violat e his moral scruples, for ex- ample, cannot expect his consci ence to accede. There is no 40"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"contradiction of conscien ce no matter how a person may wrestle with himself. Under analysis, every such situation is found to have right on one side and temptation on the other. In the early part of this chap ter, I said that the average person seldom knowingly risks punishment by others or himself. I discussed conscience sufficiently to show the bases of my reasoning. I showed that the average person wants to be right, that he wants it with good reason, and that he has more reason for wanting it than he imagines. But I did not exhaust the reasons why the average person will not knowingly do what is wrong. Above and beyond punishment by himself and others, the average person intuitivel y knows that wrong action is both immoral and inexpedient. He intuitively knows that right action is both expedient and good. He wants to be right when he can. He wants to be right so uniformly that he cannot ordinarily take wrong action without first con- vincing himself that, in this instance, it is right. In other words, he wants to be right. It is a primal urge that he will gratify whenever he can. From the foregoing statements, it follows that the aver- age person not only wants to be right, but he is also con- vinced that he is right. He believes that what he does is fair and honest. When he isn’t convinced, he changes his be- havior simply to live at peace with himself. It is true that under sufficient temptation, the average person may cross the line of what he ordinarily considers honest. But he somehow rationa lizes his act—before, dur- ing and after its occurrence. He may have to struggle to do it particularly if someone challenges him. Sometimes that takes a lot of ingenuity, but he tries to come up with a plau- sible story. Often the fact that he protests too much gives 41"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"him away. If you confront him in an indefensible position and destroy his carefully fabr icated explanation, you inflict emotional wounds that may cause him to dislike you for a long time. The reason is that he is ashamed of his dishon- esty; it is a reflection of the fact that he wants to look right, especially in the eyes of others. That is another way of sayi ng that it is dangerous to question openly any person’s honesty. And it leads me to state that I have no intention of questioning anybody’s. That is his job, not mine. But if he learns as much by ques- tioning his as I have learned by questioning mine—an act, I think, too few people pursue—he ’ll certainly be glad he did. Not only does the average person want to be right and to feel convinced that he is ri ght, he also has an instinctive desire to see his in ner convictions justified by the events of life. He wants to see right win out. He is somehow dissatis- fied with a novel or movie in which right does not triumph. At this point, I would add a word of caution that anyone who gets his knowledge of right and wrong from novels and movies has wide areas of misinformation. Despite all these tendencies of the average person to be right, he often falls into error. If you closely observe practi- cally anyone during a reasonable length of time, you will see clear-cut violations of honest y within the strict terms of this book; some of those terms have yet to be defined. However, they are not so strict but that a victim of such dishonesty would invariably ag ree with the terms, provided only that he is sufficiently aware of what occurred. You will see examples of dishonesty that seemingly violate the perpetra tor’s own expressed standards of con- duct. What those examples of inconsistency show is not that he lacks standards of conduct. He has them whether he 42"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"realizes it or not. So far as he is aware of them, he is usu- ally proud of his standards even when they are erroneous. Often he is quite frank in discussing them. He almost al- ways lives by them, whatever they are. That brings us to the statem ent that the average person is usually scrupulous about observing the generally recog- nized standards of conduct c onsidered sound, and he is equally scrupulous about obser ving his additional personal standards, whatever they are. He would be ashamed to do otherwise, and his shame is enough to keep certain dishon- est urges in check. But you have doubtless observed that there is a wide variation in the personal standards of con- duct among different people. What one person does easily is outside the pale for another. As stated, the average person will not pick your pocket. He might pick your mind. He will not bear false witness against you. He might cop off the glory for one of your ac- complishments. It all depends on what his standards permit. There is another kind of inconsistency that afflicts the average person. He has one set of standards for his friends, another and lower one for strangers, perhaps a still lower one for “soulless” corporations, and his lowest is reserved for the people he dislikes, especially his enemies. Most people think that attitude is natural. For anybody who con- siders it good practice, I should like to suggest that he keep his mind open on the subject. Since I have shown why I f eel optimistic about the av- erage person’s ability to live up to his standards of behavior whatever they are, in the ne xt chapter, I shall paint the other side of the picture. 43"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Chapter 5 Many Individuals Are Confused Once I parked my car in a nearby city while I delivered a lecture. When I returned to the car, it bore a ticket for il- legal parking. “Stop in at City Hall,” the ticket warned, “and pay your fine.” I did. A week later I went to the same city and appeared be- fore the same audience. During my talk, I casually men- tioned the parking ticket. A member of the audience spoke up. “Why didn’t you bring the tick et with you tonight?” he asked. “I could have saved you some money.” Other members of the group were not to be outdone. Ability to fix a traffic ticket, it seemed, was not unusual. I asked the group, “How many of you could have fixed that ticket for me?” As far as I could see, every hand went up. To make sure that my eyes were not deceiving me, I put the question in reverse. “Is ther e anyone in this room who could not have fixed that ticket?” Not a hand went up. That was an audience of intelligent and well-educated men. Many were executives, at tending a meeting sponsored by a prominent religious organization. Each one, I feel sure, would have instantly resented any aspersion on his personal integrity. According to the definition used in this book, those men were not honest. I realize that there are ma ny persons who see nothing wrong in using political pull to avoid a fine. Many are proud of their ability to do it and consider it smart. They would be genuinely astonished to hear anyone suggest that 44"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"they are the sort of people who are putting the skids under our national freedom. Maybe you think I am magnifying a trivial point. But, quite definitely, the point is no t trivial. It shows a flaw in our national character; one that should be corrected. If occasionally a person has a traffic ticket fixed, he should forsake that convenienc e in the future. In doing so, that particular practice will be replaced with a concept far more valuable than money. While you are reading what is to come, it is helpful to remember that the average pe rson who does what is wrong is more a victim of error than a miscreant. What he needs, therefore, is help, not censur e. Keeping that fact in mind helps a person to avoid some emotional shocks. These theories and principles have been more than twenty years in development. During that time, I discov- ered and corrected many habitu al errors in my own think- ing. How many, I could not say; I am still finding them. One reason is that, in my student days, I had teachers who quite unintentionally taught me concepts that were not true, resulting in conclusions that were false. Similarly the average person has numerous unsuspected false notions that he reasons from daily. Th ey continue to deliver wrong conclusions until they are corr ected. It necessarily follows that those uncritically accepte d false notions distort think- ing in considering the topics to which they relate. I am go- ing to write frankly about that problem; and in developing my subject, I shall talk about ethics. Several friends and advisers recommended that I should not write about ethics because it is a dull, academic subject and people are not interested. Nonetheless it is included because ignoring ethics is what is keeping society locked in many kinds of trouble. 45"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"If ignoring the study of ethi cs meant only that people were turning their backs on a dull subject, ethics could safely be overlooked, but that is not the case. Ignoring eth- ics leads to a sort of ignoran ce that threatens our whole way of life. Personally, I am an ethics zealot, because I am certain that virtually all our public and private problems are basi- cally ethical in nature. What does the word “ethics” really mean? The dictionary defines ethics as the discipline that treats of morals and right behavior. I should like to repeat a few principles that elaborate on that definition. They are the same principles earlier cited th at are supported in the next several pages. Here are those principles: Right cannot be wrong. Wrong cannot be right. Right action cannot lead to wrong results. Wrong action cannot lead to right results. Wrong action has to lead to wrong results. Right action has to lead to right results. There- fore, everybody owes it to himself to think, say and do what is right and to refuse to think, say or do what is wrong. The reason so many people di spute those principles is that they think they have seen exceptions to them. Person- ally I never have, although I have seen what looked like exceptions. Analysis of many hundreds of those seeming exceptions revealed that ther e were none. What I did learn as a result of those analyses was astonishing. One thing I learned is that refusal to accept those state- ments leads to personal confus ion. The following is a small example: Recently I submitted an article on human relations to a national magazine. When it came back with several pas- 46"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"sages crossed out, I discussed them with the editor. He commented that the indicated passages were not about hu- man relations but about ethics, and they were off the sub- ject. That thinking is commonly shared. One of the reasons for difficult human relations is the belief that ethics has nothing to do with the subject. In reality, ethics is a prime consideration, because the basi c point is usually a moral one. Yet if you go into almost any institution of learning, you discover that human relati ons, in certain phases, is taught in a manner that contradicts sound, commonly ac- cepted ethical points. Those cont radictions are seldom chal- lenged. Consider salesmanship, for example. Who can deny that millions of salespeople are trained to advance the strong points in a presentation while con- cealing the weak ones? There are people who believe that such practice is the essence of salesmanship. I remember being taught to ta ke the weakest point in an article of merchandise and c onvert it into the strongest. When the price is too high, say, “It pays to spend a little more and get the best.” When cheap construction has been used, say, “Our engineers have devised a way of getting more strength with less material.” There are other tricks, and many salespeople utilize them when necessary to land an order. Indeed, such tact ics are considered smart. Consider debating. My own training included the following rather astonish- ing statement: A good debater is one who can get on either side of a question and win. Those people say that such is the essence of debating. I ha ve watched debaters advance arguments they knew were specious and accept applause from an audience who knew that sound ethics had been dis- 47"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"carded. I submit that no debate can be honest unless each participant is wholly sincere; yet the sincere approach is often considered not practical. Does the average person prefer sophistry? Consider advertising. A manufacturer of hosiery took out some threads from his product, leaving the original thickness only in the heel and toe. Then he advertised that the heel and toe were rein- forced. To his friends, he frankly admitted that his advertis- ing was a lie, but it did increase sales to unsuspecting con- sumers. That sort of deception is not only taught in schools of advertising, but I have known th em to use the same sort of dishonesty in seeking enrollments. Consider public relations. Many experts assert that the purpose of public relations is to mold public opinion to be favorable to a company, a product or an individual. The ri ght approach is to analyze whether the company, product or individual is sound; then to take stock of weaknesses and errors; correct them; and finally see to it that the public gets an accurate impression of the facts. Certainly it is ri ght to correct errors in the pub- lic mind, but is that the way public relations are handled? I have often seen them handled, seldom in that way. The usual procedure is more like the approach em- ployed by a supervisor of schools quoted in a newspaper column, “Sing the strengths of the school and its teachers always.” It is generally agreed that our schools, colleges and uni- versities should not present te achings that contradict the known principles of ethics. But how can a person invaria- bly distinguish betw een right and wrong? My analyses in- dicate that distinctions betw een right and wrong are ordi- 48"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"narily clear-cut, but I have analyzed many in which the confused person was victimized by his own wrong thoughts. This is a typical example. Recently I talked with a ma n whose intelligence I re- spect. In his special field, he knows how to solve problems and get things done. He told me of a speaker he had heard whose topic had been “Preserve the American Way of Life.” My informant said, “That speaker was good. He spoke of how much graft and corruption infest our government. He cited examples. He named names and described the sort of bait and deals that he lp swing an election.” As my informant described the ovation accorded that speaker, I wondered how many other listeners, when it seemed to their advantage, ha d resorted to the dishonesty they condemned. I knew my informant was not blameless. Several months earlier he had told me how he had ob- tained a building permit. “If you walk into City Hall with your hat in hand, you’ll see a politician reading a newspa- per behind his desk. He’ll let you stand and wait for a while before he hears your request. Then, if he has any reason to deny your request, he’l l do it. But someone tipped me off to the right procedure. You ca rry a book under your arm and put a bill in it for a bookmark. Y ou let the end of the money stick out where the politician can see it. Even if there are several people ahead of you, the politician will beckon, get you aside, and find out what you want. You tell him. While you are telling him, you put the book where you can’t see it, but he can. Pretty soon he gives you what you want; you take your book and leave. When you get outside, you find the money is gone.” 49"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"My informant had chuckled in obvious delight. “I tried it, and it worked!” It is a curious anomaly that this man could have been so inconsistent in his thinking. I sa id that I respected his intel- ligence, but that respect is confined to the areas in which his intelligence is valid. In ot her areas, I fear his stupidity. Especially I fear the results of the same sort of stupidity on the part of millions of people, all bent on using shortcuts in getting their way, pursuing their special interests while condemning others who employ the same shortcuts while pursuing theirs. For people in the mass, there is a sharp difference be- tween what is practiced and what is preached. The unfortu- nate result is that what is practiced is embodied in our sys- tem of doing business and our system of government. Some people resist the dishone st system as did the head of a construction firm. He went into that same City Hall. In a loud voice, he told every politician who blocked him, “If you try to deny that permit, you are violating the law. I’m entitled to it, and it’s your duty to provide it. If you do not, what am I to think except th at you want a payoff from my company? Do you want to make an issue of it?” He got what he needed a nd saved thousands of payoff dollars that previously had been routine. I have reported that story part ly to show that the person who insists on what is right an d refuses to accept what is wrong can use that approach to advance his interests. As a matter of fact, it is the right thing to do. Another example of this seemingly honest head of a construction firm shows his unsuspected departure from right. Some years ago he wanted to make a long train trip. Because all the accommodations were sold out, he sneaked into a sleeping car on the train he wanted to take, locked 50"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"himself in a drawing room and went to bed as fast as he could. When the holder of the correct ticket arrived, he couldn’t get in. By the time the conductor was summoned, the train was under way. When the conductor knocked, the occupant was indignant, threat ened to report the conductor and have his company boycott th at railroad in the future. The conductor was only too glad to settle the matter by tak- ing advantage of a drawing room left vacant by a patron who had missed the train. The proud construction man continued, “Next morning there was a different conductor. When he saw me, he was mad as a hornet, but I was al l apologies. I told him I had been so tired and in such a hurry that my judgment must have deserted me. Then I gave him a generous tip, and when he left, we were like old friends.” Many conflicting ideas went through my mind during the foregoing recital, and there were several things I wanted to say. I decided to try one. “C ould it be that your generous tip was a bribe?” I asked. “Oh, no. It would’ve been a br ibe if I’d given it to the conductor in advance. I woul dn’t do that. I don’t condone bribery!” What shortsightedness could so distort the thinking of an obviously intelligent man? We are coming to that. Consider next the case of a prominent law firm headed by a congressman. A client w ho had overparked brought in a parking ticket with the request that it be handled. In a rou- tine way, the congressman turned the ticket ove r to an as- sistant. As soon as the clie nt was gone, an onlooker who disliked such practices voiced his objections and asked if anything could be done to stop it. “The practice is wrong,” said the congressman, “and should be stopped. I’ll join and support any movement to that effect, but under present 51"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"conditions, there is nothing I can do about it. Every law firm in the city fixes traffic tickets for its clients. Most know it is wrong. But every lawyer knows that if he refused to do it, he would simply hand the business to his competi- tors.” I could go on with a long series of such cases, but there is no need. The average person knows about them. How- ever, not everybody realizes that society is cau ght in a vi- cious mental trap that needs to be exposed. 52"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Chapter 6 Masses of People Are Dishonest The purpose of this chapter is to show that masses of people, individually and coll ectively, are dishonest. We shall start with a discussion of stealing. If anyone should think stealing an inconsequential form of dishonesty that few people practice, he will st op thinking it before finishing this chapter. One reason we are going to talk about stealing is that it represents dishonesty in one of its more spectacular forms. Another is that the person w ho commits a direct act of stealing can hardly be thought unconscious of that dishon- esty. But the main reason is that the person who steals thereby demonstrates a willingness to steal. If he will steal, it is reasonable to assume that he will engage in other forms of dishonesty with a less recognized flavor of wrong than stealing—of which there are many. Here are a few basic facts: There are laws against robbing your neighbor’s house. Thus laws formalize a prohibitio n against an act that every- body knows is wrong, and no matter what the moral aspect, those laws were established for the public’s protection. If people everywhere were honest, such laws would not be necessary. In the moral sense, the thing that is wrong about rob- bing your neighbor’s house is not that it is against the law. The law merely recognizes a principle and tries to force people to live by that principle. The same principle is given other forms of legal recognition. It is illegal to rob any- 53"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"body’s house. It is illegal to rob a pedestrian, a train, a cor- poration, a government, or any other individual or group. That is, it is illegal to rob by the direct physical act of steal- ing any of a person’s tangible possessions. What is wrong about stealing? Discard the legal as- pects, and think only of moral considerations. By stealing, you get somethi ng to which you are not en- titled. At the expense of somebody else, you get something you have not earned nor paid fo r in toil or wealth. You de- prive someone of a possession that is rightfully his and compel him to make a sacrifice against his will. To do any of those things is morally wrong as is recognized by nu- merous laws. The laws specifically define and forbid stealing, but there are also many apparently unrelated laws that, in a sense, are prohibitions agains t stealing. They prohibit sub- tracting from the rights of othe rs, against taking something of tangible or intangible value to which a person is not enti- tled and that he can get only by detriment to someone else. It is easy to see the conn ection to stealing with laws against bribery or graft. But reflect on laws against barking dogs that prevent people from stealing their neighbors’ sleep and peace of mind; laws against parking that prevent a motorist from stealing space more urgently needed for another purpose; laws favoring public health that prevent one person’s negligence from stealing, perhaps, the health of an entire city. Analysis of many laws shows that the principle that stealing is wrong is somehow involved. Many forms of stealing are illegal, but there are oth- ers that are not. Yet the prin ciple against stealing extends beyond those laws. By definition, a prin ciple is a universal truth. Therefore, the principl e applies equally to the other 54"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"ways of stealing in which no in fraction of man-made law is involved. People instinctively know it. They also know that there are people who have made themselves rich by taking advantage of opportunities to steal within the law. There are people who will steal whether it is legal or not. The more intelligent they are and the more they know about the laws and their legal loopholes, the more danger- ous those people will be. Then there are people who w ill not steal because it is wrong. No laws are needed to hold those people in check; they can be trusted with the keys to your car and house. But society has not yet developed means for protecting itself against the people who will st eal when stealing is legal. What is needed is a way of raising those people to the moral level of those who will not steal because it is wrong. That would give us a moral ut opia so far as stealing is con- cerned. Before me is a news c lipping quoting a group of bank- ers praising the honesty of th e average citizen. Those bank- ers call him honest because he seldom fails to repay a bank loan. If the clipping represents their real view, they misun- derstand what fundamental hon esty implies. I presume their remarks come under the head of public relations. When an average person borrows from a bank, unless he is already known to the loan officer, he is investigated. Unless he is proved financiall y responsible, he doesn’t get the loan. Therefore, the bankers should praise their ability to select borrowers who can and will repay, for that is what the repayment statistics really mean. How much confidence a bank has in the average person is partly shown by the check protectors it uses, the surety bonds it requires on its employees, the watchmen and 55"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"guards it employs, the locks on its doors and vaults, the burglar alarms and theft insurance that protect its assets, and the chains on the pens in its lobbies. Those things do not reflect on the bankers. They reflect on the average per- son. Under the usual safeguards our society has set up, it is perhaps true that few persons would commit an outright theft. But the lock industry is founded on the fact that there are enough thieves to make people’s possessions unsafe unless they are protected. In a really honest society there would be no lock industry, no credit agencies, no detec- tives, fewer laws, fewer jails and fewer policemen. Subway exit turnstiles are so constructed as to prevent dishonest patrons from entering through them to evade payment of fare. Slot-machine turnstiles are made with a magnifying glass window so that a slug is more easily de- tected. The cashier is enclosed in a grilled compartment to prevent patrons from reaching in and stealing coins. When a passenger boards a railroad train, he is sup- posed to have a ticket purchased from a ticket agent. He gets it through a small hole in a wall protected by a metal grille so that nobody can reach into the hole to grab a hand- ful of money. After boarding the train, the conductor is supposed to see that he really hands in th e ticket instead of saving it to use on the next trip. Maybe the average person is honest, but riding on a lo- cal train, I have often seen passengers taking advantage of opportunities to save their tickets. I have seen holders of commutation tickets slyly picking up the bit of cardboard punched out by the conductor to fill the hole so the same square can be punched again. Over the years, no less th an thirty people have sug- gested that tricky procedure to me. It was done with an air 56"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"of letting me in on a profitable secret. None of them would have picked my pocket, robbe d my house or cheated me in an ordinary business deal. But all of them thought it proper to cheat the railroad company. “After all,” said one, “they have lots of money.” I know a restaurant where you figure your own bill. On the way out, the diner tells the cashier what he owes and pays it. That restaurant made a reputation out of trusting its patrons. I ate there once and di scovered how far that trust goes. When I stated the amount of my bill to the cashier, he· called out the figure in a voice that could have filled a large auditorium. Why? My guess is that he was instructed to give the patrons a chance to check up on each other’s honesty and also to shame a diner if he needed it. If people must be shamed into honesty even in a minor financial transaction, they are not honest. Clearly our soci- ety is not geared to an assu mption that the average person is honest. It is geared to an assumption that he is not. Even if a person accepts the belief that the average per- son will almost always do the right thing, he takes precau- tions. He habitually counts his change, keeps an eye on his possessions, takes out burglar y insurance and keeps his valuables in a safe deposit box. There are prudent motorists who seldom drive anywhere without locking themselves in their cars. I am one of them . The locked doors are to pre- vent someone from forcing his way into my car to steal it, my money and my life while I am waiting at a traffic light. That sort of thing is being done. Let us next consider ho w many people will commit the act of stealing when the usual safeguards are down. Once I stopped at a little restaurant in a rural commu- nity. Just before I arrived, a tr uck loaded with chickens had upset several hundred feet down the road. The damaged 57"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"crates were strewn across an open field, and chickens roamed all over the countryside. Soon a line of cars collected. Motorists got out to help the driver capture chickens. They had a field day. With few exceptions, those motorists put the chickens they caught into their own cars. The operator of a nearby gasoline sta- tion herded several into hi s washroom. The restaurant owner collected some in his cellar. The truck driver re- gained less than half his original load. A druggist put an umbrella into one of his telephone booths for the explicit purpose of testing his customers’ honesty. Twenty times during the first day, he caught a cus- tomer in the act of leaving with that umbrella. To avoid embarrassment that might have wrecked his business, the druggist had to discontinue his experiment. Consider two more cases: A student lost his trunk. On e year later it was discov- ered in a college dormitory wher e it had been left when he transferred to another school . Only two unattractive items were in it. Shortly afterward, he called at his old dormitory, visiting among his former frie nds. He said nothing about the trunk, but he saw his alar m clock, typewriter, tennis racket, several books and various items of his clothing in possession of his former fellow students. An air force officer shot down over enemy territory, unexpectedly returned sometime later to discover that all his possessions had been redist ributed. Even his wallet, of- ficially turned in for safekeeping, was missing several hun- dred dollars. He is a bit cynica l about what his buddies will do when their honesty is put under the strain of tempting opportunity. The examples just given are not questionable cases. Each involved stealing. They involved dishonesty that is 58"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"punishable under law when it is proved. They involved a number of culprits. They show that even the dishonesty of stealing can and does occur on what amounts to a mass ba- sis, and also what the average person may do when he sees the chance to get away with it. However, there are many kinds of widespread dishonesty that are harder to detect. Consider the person who pockets money he finds with- out seeking its owner, the person who mails personal letters at his employer’s expense, who accepts an excessive amount of change when making a purchase, or who drives away from a car he has damaged while parking. Consider the tradesman who overcharges , the waiter who gives short change, the repairman who bills you for work not done, the professional who takes advant age of people’s ignorance to sell unneeded services, or the one who makes his services seem complicated to justify an exorbitant f ee. All those practices are dishonest. There are also kinds of dishonesty that the average per- son does not consider dishonest. When he thinks they will advance his cause, he has no hesitation about using them. Consider the person who pushe s ahead in a line of pa- trons at a store or restaurant, the automobile driver who parks double or squeezes ahead at a traffic light, the person who demands extra service and chisels on the price, the person who makes a promise he cannot keep, and the per- son who plays all the angles and works both ends against the middle under an assumption that he is using his head. It would be easy to fill a book w ith common examples of that sort of dishonesty. Probably nobody could read ve ry far without recogniz- ing various kinds of dishonesty that he has occasionally practiced himself. I can’t, and I am not proud of that. When we do such things, it is easy to delude ourselves that one 59"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"individual is hardly important. But it isn’t a case of one in- dividual. Such things are done by millions of people every day. The resulting chaos in our mass character is frighten- ing. It is almost correct to sa y that the only reasonably hon- est person is the one who will admit that he has been re- peatedly dishonest, with himsel f and others, and has done it so habitually that he has long since ceased to notice it even in his own mind. There are people who will defend and justify their dis- honesty because it is minor and infrequent. But the person who is ninety-eight percent honest is still two percent dis- honest, and that is enough to throw his whole life off the track. Nobody is dishones t all the time, not even the most hardened criminal. Perhaps this discussion would lead a reader to suppose that I have gone about looking for examples of dishonesty. Occasionally I have. “Of course,” he may say, “anyone who looks for dishonesty will fi nd it.” That is true. But it is also true that dishonesty ca nnot be found where it does not exist. The truth is that it can be found almost anywhere. Consider some additional cases. The manufacturer who produces dishonest or dangerous merchandise. The salesman who tricks a prospective cus- tomer’s mind. The union that makes jobs where no jobs exist. The person who concocts an explanation of a failure that was due to his personal negligence, who takes or ac- cepts credit for somebody else ’s achievement, who under- mines his competitors or who damages the interests of per- sons he considers opponents or enemies. The employer who improperly takes advantag e of extra work or special ability or unfairly restrict s an employee’s earnings, who denies opportunities to a promis ing subordinate for fear of 60"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"his competition. The yes man who says only what he thinks his superiors want to hear. The worker who neglects his responsibilities, creates a false impression of knowledge and ability, gets by on inferior work, demands more than he is worth or otherwise fails to live up to the obligations im- plied in any working relationship. Maybe you don’t think such things occur very often, but I could write a book about any of the foregoing exam- ples just by telling what I have seen. In fact, I’ll expand one of them through another couple of paragraphs. Workers often complain over unfairness from manage- ment, but what workers occasionally do to their employers is equally unfair. Consider the worker who instead of quit- ting gets himself fired after he has planned a vacation or accepted a position with another employer so that he can collect severance or vacation pa y or fill in a few weeks’ gap with unemployment payments. Workers have developed an appalling number of de- vices for taking advantage of their employers. In almost every business organization, it is customar y for workers to start late and quit early. When employers recognize that human tendency by giving a few minutes’ leeway, the lee- way is immediately added to the loss already suffered. When a rest period is provided during the day, the result is only that there is a new opport unity for early quitting and late starting. The condition is so general that the average employer will sputter when he hears the subject mentioned or perhaps shrug his shoulders in resignation. Consider also the innumerable cases of individuals who will betray a public trust: The medical intern or policeman who robs drunken or unconscious accident victims on the way to the hospital, the 61"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"politicians who settle a brush w ith the law, contractors who “buy” municipal jobs, and politicians who “sell” them. The office seeker who makes unreasonable campaign promises or who makes reasonable promises he does not keep. The voter who disregards public good and casts his ballot in return for dishonest advantage, and the politician or demagogue who tempts him to do it. The pressure groups formed to establish false programs, and the legisla- tors who cringe before thei r organized selfishness. The masses of voters who raid our public treasury, and the leg- islators who dare not raise objections for fear of losing out in the next election. By any reasonable definition, those people are all dis- honest. But by no means have I exhausted the possible list. I have hardly scratched the surf ace of the dishonesty of our public servants, coroners, judge s and magistrates, tax col- lectors, legislators and govern ment administrators. I have discussed briefly the graft of petty politicians but have not shown how that graft is magnified on a national scale. I have not discussed what is dishonest about the management of corporations and unions, although every reader knows that those topics are both im portant. They have been omit- ted because including them would delay this book and make it too large for the average person to read. There is only one formula that can rescue society from its mass dishonesty. Everybody should think, say and do what is right and refuse to think, say and do what is wrong. 62"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Part II Distinguishing Right From Wrong 7.

The Great Cost of Being Wrong 63"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Chapter 7 How To Determine What Is Right The underlying thesis of this book is that dishonesty is wrong; dishonesty is wide spread; dishonesty produces wrong action and frustrates ri ght action; dishonesty de- stroys the effectiveness of human intellect, blinding peo- ple to the causes of individual and collective ills; dishon- esty is the basic threat to so ciety’s welfare and way of life and that it is time something was done to correct it. It is an obvious thesis, but the average person has not been moved by it or correction would have been made long ago. Instead, people have the delusion that problems and troubles are caused by other factors. To explain that delusion, le t us review the methods by which a person learns to di stinguish betw een right and wrong. Let us consider those me thods as they are and as they should be in a society suffi ciently versed in scientific method to have developed the atom bomb. So far as we know, a child comes into this world with- out knowledge. At first, he lives completely under the man- agement of his parents. A duty of his parents is to transfer that management, by gradual steps, to the child himself. The process begins in the fi rst years of life and normally continues through his teens. Duri ng the process, specialized help is obtained from outside training agencies, notably schools. It is presumed to be a simple duty for parents to provide knowledge of self-man agement techniques that en- able the child to develop nor mally and become a productive member of society. 64"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"As a part of that process, whether by accident or design, the child acquires standards of moral behavior. Parental supervision includes seeing that proper standards are pro- vided, that improper standards are kept from developing, and seeing that outside influen ces leading to error are coun- teracted. The child who is taught a sound moral code en- joys a favored existence and avoids much trouble. When parents fail to teach proper standards, they find themselves confronted with what is known as a problem child. It has been argued that there are no problem children but only parents who have neglected a basic duty and are themselves problem parents. But that seems unfair to par- ents, because they tend to pass along a version of what they had been taught in the same general way. If that version is sufficiently flawed, we have both problem parents and problem children. The root cause then becomes problem ancestors. Broadly speaking, no child or te en is responsible for his wrong behavior. Parental and ancestral delinquency should divide the responsibility. The child becomes responsible only as he learns standards of right behavior. If he must de- vise those standards for himself, it seems unreasonable to expect him to do it while still a child. The child should be taught st andards of behavior that keep him out of trouble. To achieve that, those standards must be sufficiently comprehensive that they also prevent his causing trouble for others. Parents sometimes neglect to instill the familiar standards, but, more serious, they lack knowledge of standards that ar e sufficiently comprehensive to serve. That is not the fault of the parents. They simply pass along portions of an incomplete inheritance. 65"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"It is time to break up that sort of thing. It is time to in- sist that suitable standards of behavior be found and put into general circulation. Some experts claim that the average person never grows up. That is, he never matures morally, emotionally and intellectually. It is argued that people are not supposed to mature intellectually, and with that I agree. To mature, according to my dictionary, means to attain full growth. In that sense I hope to mature intellectually for many more decades. What those experts mean is that the average person stops growing intellectually before he stops growing physi- cally. When that happens, it is certain that he also stops growing morally and emotionally. Unless he has already reached moral and emotional ma turity, cessation of intel- lectual growth is calamitous. While nature takes care of a person’s physical growth, moral and emotional developmen t is largely delegated to him. The continued use of intell ect is essential, because the person who stops growing intell ectually before he is mor- ally and emotionally mature becomes a moral and emo- tional cripple who then destroys much of the intellectual growth he had already attained. In this book, I am not concerned with physical growth, but I am concerned with mora l growth. To reach moral ma- turity demands the knowledge of comprehensive and reli- able standards of behavior th at automatically protect the individual against moral error in every area of his life. Insofar as I have been able to develop such standards, they are embodied in this book. It is my conviction that all those standards are undebatabl e and inarguable and that their general adoption would transform society’s way of life. 66"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"I know how much work it took to produce those stan- dards, and I had the advantage of what I consider sound moral training to get me started. The principle of absolute right is based on a natural la w of behavior that I discov- ered while working out my own moral code. The lack of widespread knowledge of that law is why there is individ- ual and collective dishonesty on a mass scale. That is also why I am not inclined to blame anybody. The child who is unknowingly guilty of an antisocial act would not be blamed for it by an understanding parent. The adult who is unknowingly gui lty of an antisocial act would not be blamed for it by an understanding contempo- rary. But when either one is knowingly guilty of outright dishonesty, he should be held accountable. First, consider how the average person actually gets his standards of behavior in cont rast with the way he should get them. To a small child, right is perhaps what Mother wants him to do: go to bed at bedtime, eat his food, brush his teeth, and such things as those. Wrong is what Mother doesn’t want him to do: engage in forbidden mischief, take dangerous risks, lie to her, and so on. Unless Mother over- taxes her wisdom, much is likely to be satisfactory about the standards of right and wrong thus established. In any event a small child quickly lear ns that right is what you are supposed to do and wrong is wh at you are not supposed to do. He absorbs an incl ination to be right, in that sense that lasts throughout life. In proportion to the ex tent he flouts it, he is made miserable. At first, the penalty for wrong action is trouble with Mother, and similarly the reward for right action is Mother’s approval. Gradually the child learns that failure to 67"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"be right leads to trouble with nature, and that lesson is the beginning of wisdom for him. He learns that di stinctions between right and wrong are not arbitrary expressi ons of maternal authority based on the fact that she is big enough to enforce her author ity. At least, that is what he learns if Mother is conscientious and ma- ture. If she selfishly allows he r emotions to decide what is right, the child never learns that natural distinctions of right and wrong are self-enforcing: attempted violations of gravity bring bumps, bruises and broken bones. He needs to learn that dishonesty naturally brings impair- ment to his intellect. There is one basic reason why Mother must interpret the distinctions between right and wrong for her child. She saves herself trouble by insis ting on good behavior, and she also saves the child from possi ble risk of a fatal lesson. The fatal lesson may come later in adult life, because the penal- ties of wrong action are inexorable, and ignorance is no ex- cuse. Mother’s job is to prot ect the child ag ainst that igno- rance until he has learned to protect himself. If there are brothers and si sters, property rights are likely to be understood early. Hu man nature being what it is, a child learns that he can expect consideration for what is his only if he gives consid eration for what belongs to others. When he gets into trouble, it is oftener because he failed to respect other persons’ ri ghts than because he failed to remember his own. It is helpful if he has brothers and sisters to remind him. Few av erage adults have failed to learn the principle of propert y rights as ch ildren, although later they may fail to respect that knowledge. There is a prevalent theory that most emotional trouble in adults springs out of the frustrations of childhood. Ap- proached carefully, frustration can be used to encourage a 68"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"child’s development. The child who is shielded from frus- tration may fail to learn how to deal with it. A person can argue the pros and cons of early frustra- tion, but he cannot argue the pros and cons of teaching a child to be honest. The child who never learns to be honest is in for trouble that inevita bly he will share with those around him. The child who learns to be honest deals with his early frustrations by extracting their value. Medical research papers are dotted with case histories of people who got into trouble because they were dishonest in their private thoughts. Ind eed, certain kinds of dishon- esty have been classified, given high-sounding names, and called emotional diseases. If we call them what they are, we can eliminate them, and the best time to start is in child- hood. The basis of intellectual dishonesty is the lie. Lying requires creative ingenuity. The child who lies, and every imaginative child has done it many times, knows that he is lying at the time. Childhood affords ample opportunity for a parent to expose more than one lie to the ch ild and to let him know that the parent knows he has lied. It affords the opportunity to discuss temptations to lie and to see that ly- ing evokes proper attention. The child who suffers frustration may blight his de- velopment, which I question, but the child who lies im- pairs his intellect. If people would cu t in half the time spent on preventing frustration and use the time saved to frustrate the habit of lying, they wouldn’t need so much mental health attention in later years. There is a reason why I have singled out lying for the foregoing rather drastic attenti on. It is that children gener- ally are told not to lie by their parents, but simultaneously 69"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"through force of example, they are taught to lie by the same parents. One of the reasons why it is less usual for children to steal than lie is because parents usually hide from their children that example of dis honesty. Children lie despite their parents’ expressed objections because most parents lie in the presence of their children often enough to contradict their own teachings. They are so accustomed to lying that they do it quite automatically. What they accomplish is to train their children to believe that a lie is wrong only when a person gets caught. As a result, children learn to increase their negative ingenuity to avoid getting caught. While it is thought that the average child gets his moral training by direct inst ruction, that is only partly true. Most of his moral training he ge ts by force of example. Example consists in what the child sees other people do. He gets examples from his peers, many of which should be counteracted, and he also ge ts examples from his elders. Since his elders are naturall y imposing and more experi- enced, the child usually accepts uncritically what he ob- serves. When he sees dishonesties that seem to work, he tends to adopt those practices. It puts the child in an anoma- lous position to find himself being punished for copying the behavior of his elders. No lect ure on honesty is likely to be heeded when it flies in the face of example. Example constitutes the most universal training me- dium for behavior, and it consists largely of what most people do. No thoughtful person would disagree that a per- son cannot learn what is righ t by observing what most peo- ple do. In addition, such observation often provides only half the lesson. When a child obs erves one of his elders in the performance of a wrong act, usually he sees only the act. Whenever possible, the pe nalty is concealed. Parents 70"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"usually take pains to see that trouble resulting from· their wrong action occurs in the child’s absence. Most often, the parents do not realize there is even any connection between the wrong act and the resulting trouble. If parents, by force of example, teach wrong action to their children, it is only fair to show the child every result- ing penalty. Parents who live up to that obligation become cautious about getting into trouble, which is to say that they learn to do what is right and avoid doing what is wrong. What people generally do constitutes a definition of custom. It is obvious that custom is a device by which dis- honesty has been transmitted from one generation to the next, passed along in the form of behavior and conversa- tion. It is also passed along in th e form of specific training which generally carries a flavor of improvement over cus- tom. The improvement comes out of the fact that home, school and religious training often disapproves of certain elements of custom. So the child learns that custom affords no infallible standards for what is right. He may learn that custom modified by what is approved by the people he re- spects affords a better standard. That is still not a reliable guide as it allows wide gaps in standards of behavior. Often it allows a person to be taught wrong behavior, because it leaves the subject of approval open to individual interpretation by fallible adults. Society needs fixed standards. Standards so elemental that when understood can be interpreted as easily by a child as by an adult. There are certain arbitrary st andards that are acceptable. In this category are the rules of a game arrived at by com- mon consent or a rule book. So long as the rules apply equally to every participant, they are fair. So long as they make the game interesting, they serve their purpose. In the 71"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"final analysis, whether they are right or wrong is not a moral question. When a child learns the rules of a game, he also learns to respect rules in various other forms by implication. He learns to respect the rules of a school, later the rules of a business organization, and similarly to respect local and national laws. There are two things wrong with that sort of moral training. First, as children ar e learning to respect rules and laws, they are also observing apparently successful infrac- tion of those rules and laws by the adults to whom they look for guidance. Second, it is difficult to allow for the fact that often the rules and laws themselves are partly or wholly wrong. Wrongness in a rule or law may occasionally compel a person to do what is forbidden to stay out of trouble. For example, I once avoided an automobile accident by disre- garding a red traffic signal. However, it is true that few laws and rules tend to prevent right action. It is more likely that unfair laws and rules exact a penalty. For example, a person may be forced to pay an unfair income tax. There is nothing he can rightly do to pr otect his interests until fair- ness is injected into the law. Those two examples show that rules and laws are only an expression of fallible minds attempting to convert moral ri ght into practical forms. By attempting to obey parent al instructions, the child learns early that man-made la ws and rules are often unjust. He would be less confused if more parents admitted their fallibility in establishing rules. He would learn more quickly that man-made laws and rules are an effort to inter- pret natural rules and laws. He would then be better able to understand that occasionally he must satisfy an unreason- able teacher and later an unreasonable boss if he under- 72"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"stood that they also are prone to error. Above all, he would learn that natural rules and laws are basic, and that he should look beneath the man- made version for the real thing. Natural law rather quickly impinges on childish con- sciousness. Such things as burned fingers, bumps, barked shins and broken toys bring hi s first knowledge of physics. Success and failure in dealing with people bring his first knowledge of human relations. With a minimum of paren- tal guidance, he learns that wh at is right gets good results, while what is wrong gets bad results. Under that sort of guidance, the child qu ickly learns that trouble is caused and does not just happen. Dishonesty is not an inherent trait. The child learns other things more eas ily than he learns dishonesty. That is obvious from the fact that his first efforts at dishonesty are naively crude, and only with practice does he become adept. Certainly his creative ability deserves higher use, for dishonesty is a prostitution of that creative ability to de- structive use. He can easily be shown that pretending a hot stove is cold does not prevent his getting burned when he touches it. From that simple beginning, the seeds of basic honesty begin to germinate. Dishonesty is always a pretense that things are different from what they are, and that is exactly why dishonesty confuses the person who uses it as a tool of thought. He tends to believe his own pretenses. Often it is said that small children show greater ability to distinguish right from wrong than adults. Perhaps that is because the small child has not had time to develop his dis- honesty. It should be emphasized that the process of devel- oping dishonesty consists of just two things: ability to fool other people and ability to fool oneself. When a person 73"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"tries to fool the law of gravity, he gets hurt, and the same is true in relation to a ny other natural law. It is established that one way to be right is to behave in strict accord with natural law. It might be that a person does not know all the natural laws, but he gets into trouble mostly by flouting the laws that are known. Natural law says that one plus one equals two. Any other answer is wrong. Any person who tries to establish another answer is trying to es tablish what is wrong. Clearly the act of trying to establis h what is wrong constitutes wrong behavior. The person who does it is attempting to misrepresent a fact. If this book convinces people of the wisdom of refusing to misrep resent facts, society would achieve greater intellectual growth than could be imagined. From the simple expedient of direct honesty, let us move to an entirely differe nt approach. There are many ways to determine what is right that seemingly have little to do with honesty as such. In a national political sense, for example, what is right is assumed to be what puts one’s party into office and keeps it there. But if there were any similarity between the outcome of an election and what is right, it would be be- cause enough honest voters made their honesty effective. America is a democracy. In a democracy, it is said that the majority rules, but that is only partly true. Those who do not vote could alter the out come of almost any election, because many voters customarily do not go to the polls. Moreover, a disproportionate percentage of voters tend to have dishonest incentives, because the lure of selfish gain is stronger than the desire fo r good citizenship. Despite all that, the candidates and issues able to collect the most votes win elections. Enough unprincipl ed voters could turn an 74"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"election into a vict ory that is both immoral and wrong, im- posing their negative will on others. Let us examine another example. At least in theory, our count ry is run by laws. Laws are made by legislators who are elected. Many powerful groups are interested in those laws. They stand to gain or lose de- pending on how the legislation is handled, and they have various ways of making th eir wishes known. They could state the facts and lobby to see that right thinking prevails. Instead many such groups raise large treasuries, send out propaganda, enlist public support, magnify every evi- dence that their cause is right while, at the same time, minimizing every evidence that their cause is wrong. If possible, they threaten wit hdrawal of political support at the next election. They may even resort to outright bribery and other forms of dishonesty. They constitute what is known as pressure groups, and everybody knows that pres- sure influences the outcome of many legislative delibera- tions. So the fact must be acknowledged that dishonest pressure often becomes a means for deciding what is right. Even a schoolchild recognizes that dishonest voting and dishonest efforts to influence legislation are morally wrong, but many adults do not. Existence of a pressure group is almost prima facie evidence of one purpose: to substitute personal force for logic. It is a device for winning desp ite the facts, and its use tends to destroy all recourse to the facts. In this society, the person with right on his side does not need personal pres- sure. Any temptation to use pe rsonal pressure should be his signal to check up on his morality and his logic. The pres- sure is in the impersonal facts of the situation; those facts speak for themselves. 75"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"The foregoing information may be difficult for a well- meaning person to accept. There are numerous militant groups waging incessant campaigns in favor of what they believe is right. Their leader s might ask, “What about pres- sure in favor of right?” That is a good question, and it has a good answer. In practically any field of human relations, meeting pressure with pressure gives an advantage to the side with greater deviation from facts. That side will be more devi- ous, and other things being equa l, will exert more pressure. That is why our network of pressure groups is counterpro- ductive and does not really re solve our pressing problems. There are many different kinds of pressure groups, and each apparently considers its cause little short of holy. Starting in the political scene with the most ruthless dicta- tor, you can work your way down to the family scene in which the small child takes a toy away from a baby. What makes a pressure group dangerous is the element of unfair persuasion by which it seeks to capture a decision. Remove the pressure and you remove the danger—a state- ment exactly as logical as it sounds. In a national political sense, pressure can be defined as the outward expression of or ganized control over others. The way to eliminate pressure is not to counter it with pres- sure. It is to use logic and present solid facts. The group working for public good by honest procedures is not a pressure group and does not need to be militant. What I have described are two criteria by which people determine what is right. They let opposing groups collide and argue with the aid of political and economic force until one side develops enough pre ssure to collect enough votes to get a decision. The two sides may be Republicans and Democrats, management and labor, capitalists and social- 76"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"ists, religious or racial o pponents, and any other combina- tion of groups having what th ey consider to be opposing interests. Pressure groups are always at least partly wrong. They are formed to gain or perpetuate special privilege or to pre- vent the same things from be ing done by others. Pressure thrives on specious arguments, concealment of truth, col- lection of fraudulent political support. It is almost always wrong to create, support or yi eld to pressure. The only rea- sonable purpose of pressure is to counteract pressure that is unfair as when a policeman arrests a holdup man. When no infraction of law is involved, counteracting pressure is ac- complished by simple exposure of truth. “Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free” is a wise teach- ing. Unfortunately the temptation to create pressure is greater than the desire to counteract it, and often the oppo- sition may not speak up for fear of reprisals. All those difficulties and more tend to surround every expression of organized pressu re, and most people know it. In view of that, it takes a mighty strong case to justify per- sonal pressure for any cause whatever. The lesson is that society should neither tolerate nor support any form of such pressure, and that lacking clear-cut evidence, the voters and legislators should ignore organized pressure in favor of de- cisions dictated by logic and solid facts. In that event, our public issues could be approach ed on a basis of logical and honest reasoning. Pressure afflicts more than the political scene. There is also the pressure of personal authority in any form. People know what it is like to yield to an arbitrary decision made by a negligent or insincere pers on in a superior position. An executive may take unfair advantage of subordinates, and 77"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"an organized group representi ng a pocket of entrenched dishonesty may impose its will on others. When people are subjected to unfair treatment, human nature is such that they are tempted to fight back. But fight- ing is only another e ffort to substitute force for logic. At best, it is an attempt to use might to enforce right, and I must admit, it is often done. When a person’s life is in danger, it is difficult to justify an assumption that he should sacrifice it rather than fight, on either an individual or na tional basis. Most people think that it pays to be ready to defeat an enemy who threatens your extermination. The rights and wrongs of killing an en- emy who threatens your life do not come within the scope of this book, so until somebody comes up with a logical reason against it, I shall cont inue to support preparedness. But I do think that it is wrong to fight when better means of establishing right are available as almost invariably they are. Nevertheless, because of countless examples that start in early childhood and continue throughout our lives, fight- ing seems to be one of the pr ocedures for deciding what is right. But fighting, like any other kind of pressure, is usu- ally a way of handing the victor y to the strongest and most unscrupulous adversary. Instead of fightin g, intelligent right action would lead to a satisfactory outcome, an d it is well to remember that whenever temptation to fight arises. Fundamentally fight- ing is wrong as will be dem onstrated in a succeeding chap- ter. Therefore, when fighting begins, the person who was right no longer is right—not completely. The result? He misses his opportunity to profit by the fact that right is might, whether you are talking a bout an individual or a na- tion. 78"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Chapter 8 Defining Honesty and Dishonesty From the foregoing discussion, it is evident that the av- erage person does not have properly established procedures for distinguishing between right and wrong. A young per- son is confronted with so much contradictory instruction and evidence that he grows up confused. Too often without knowing it, he continues to grow more confused as he ma- tures. It is generally recognized that comprehensive princi- ples are needed to dispel th at confusion, and the purpose of this chapter is to present information about those principles. Essentially this is a chapter of definition. Therefore, it is fitting that we turn to the dictionary for guidance. Four words call for attention. Honesty: adherence to the facts; freedom from deceit; fairness; straightforwardness. Dishonesty: lack of truth or inte grity; disposition to de- fraud or deceive. Right: in accordance with tr uth, justice or law; con- forming to facts or truth; not mistaken; real, proper, fair, honest; genuine; correct. Wrong: deviating from facts; injurious; unfair; some- thing immoral, unethical; that which is contrary to right, justice, goodness, equity or law; incorrect. The dictionary also gives enlightening synonyms for honesty: sincerity, fairness, inte grity, probity, uprightness, rectitude, with the following further definition: Honesty is that quality of a person that s hows him fair and truthful in 79"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"speech, implying a refusal to lie, cheat, steal, or deceive in any other way. Uprightness is that quality in man that carries him along a straight path of honesty and duty. Integrity emphasizes the wholene ss of man’s moral na- ture; he is sound, incorruptible, and particularly strict about fulfilling the trusts reposed in him by others. Probity is virtue which has been put to the test and never found wanting; adherenc e to the highest principles and ideals; it can be said that probity is demonstrated in honesty beyond a person’s mere care for the property of others; he regards their good name, their every concern with the same conscience as he would his own. Those are all common-sense definitions. In certain scientific circles, common sense has taken a drubbing in recent years. It is said that there are higher lev- els of intelligence than common sense, and that I do not doubt. But it may be observed th at when scientists neglect common sense, they get into the same trouble as other peo- ple, indicating the need to live on a plane of common sense before deserting it to go higher. Among other things, I am referring to William James’s assertion that truth is not necessarily what is in accord with fact. Despite the insight of his philosophy of pragmatism, I am going to assert that by adva ncing the theory that right is what works, James laid the foundation for a lot of unrecog- nized dishonesty in people’s minds. It would be better to say that what works is what is right, and to make it clear, wh at is not right will not work without some kind of detrimen t. Further, when a person asks an honest question, he de serves an honest answer. And to all practical purposes of ordinary life, an honest answer 80"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"is factually correct. It is on th at level of common sense that this chapter is written. It hardly seems necessary to say that dishonesty is wrong. If proof were needed, it could be found in the fre- quency with which dishonesty causes problems and trou- ble; but this book is written for persons who do not dispute the point. In addition, it is wri tten to reveal the cause and effect of dishonest action when people attempt to violate a natural behavioral law: right action gets right results, whereas wrong action gets wrong results. As a young person, developing his moral code, I was confronted with a trick question: A seriously ill woman asks about her son who has had an accident. She doesn’t know it, but the son is dead. Any sudden shock could cause her death, too. Should you kill her by telling the truth, or should you protect her life by lying? That type of question has thrown a lot of young minds into confusion. I am not going to say how it should be answered; only that the moral answer is bot h expedient and true. And I should add that never, except when asked that sort of hypo- thetical question, have I been confronted with so compli- cated a choice. Ordinarily lif e confronts the average person with situations that would re quire greater ingenuity to con- coct a wrong answer than to choose the right one. I have seen a lot of people get into trouble by lying. Never have I seen anyone get into trouble by telling an in- telligently managed truth. The person whose situation seems to call for a lie has made a wrong turn somewhere earlier. He did or said a wrong thing he feels obligated to protect. He should backtrack to make a correction, not add a lie to his earlier blunder. 81"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"There is also the question of diplomacy. When presen- tation of an unpalatable truth is required, the job should be done without friction and emotional damage. That may take careful thought. Resorting to a lie only shows lack of abil- ity in handling human relations. It does not show that ly- ing in that particular circumstance is right. Lying is dishonest; therefor e, it is wrong to deceive. The usual tool of deceit is the lie. A lie is an incorrect, false or untrue statement. It is untrue because it is not in accord with fact—with reality. But not every untrue statement is necessarily deceitful. Fiction, poetry and parables are all means for presenting ideas in imaginative form, and if the ideas are true to life, no d eceit is involved. Nor is deceit involved in a clearly fictional story told for interest or amusement. It is wrong to deceive by creating a false impression, by use of misleading words, by twisting the meanings of words, by concealing one side of a controversial issue, by exaggeration or understatement, or by misrepresentation of any sort. There are other ways of deceiving, and some of them do not involve speech. It is wrong to create a false impression by implication or by deed, by obscuring vital truth, by failure to provide essential information, by hy- pocrisy, pretense, insincerity or sham. To create an unintentional false impression is as wrong as to do it on purpose. In either case, the result is deception. Therefore, it is wrong to permit a false impression to be created by negligence. It is also wrong to let a false impres- sion go uncorrected. To sum up, it is wrong to cause or permit deception by creating or failing to correct a false impression. Those issues that have no consequence to the deceiver, to the person deceived or to an innocent victim of the deceit can be eliminated. As stated, hair-splitting is sel- 82"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"dom essential to practical app lication of the principle of absolute right: always think, say and do what is right; re- fuse to think, say and do what is wrong. In accord with the foregoing definitions, here are ex- amples of dishonesty: the yes man who conceals informa- tion his boss might resent, th e teacher who switches to a lesson that will show her to advantage when her supervisor enters the classroom, the driver whose direction signal shows turns that are not made , the person who varies facts according to what he is trying to prove, the debater who uses humor or ridicule to c onfuse issues or opponents, the politician who misrepre sents a public issue. Negligence and irresponsibility might be described as unintentional dishonesty. There may be disagreement that unintentional dishonesty is precisely as wrong as inten- tional dishonesty, but analysis will demonstrate that it is. Provable negligence in an accident case is actionable in court. Disastrous negligence by an employee is accepted as cause for discharge. Those are man-made regulations; for another point of view, let us turn to nature. When a person strikes the pavement at the base of a tall building, does na- ture adjust the penalty in accordance with whether he fell or jumped or was pushed purposely or by accident? The an- swer explains why negligen ce and irresponsibility are wrong. What is wrong about negligence is that the irresponsible person places someone’s welfar e in the control of chance. Once that has been done, nobody can influence the out- come. By no stretch of imagin ation can that procedure be called right or honest, whether it is done intentionally or not. Consider another s ituation. If a motori st drives through a crowd of pedestrians, chance decides whether anybody 83"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"gets killed. The law may pena lize him heavily if a death results and lightly if it doesn’t , but the wrong is exactly as wrong as when nobody is hurt. If this example seems far- fetched, carry it into the next step. The chance-taker is someone with a habit of taking chances. If no damage results on one occasion, he feels relatively safe. Consider the ga me of Russian roulette. The rules are simple. The chance-taker puts one cartridge into a revolver, gives the barrel a sp in, points the muzzle at his temple and pulls the trigger, trusting to chance that the car- tridge is not in firing position. If it is, he loses his life. If he uses a six-shooter, he has five chances to one of surviving. Among other things, the law of chance says that if a person keeps taking chances, he will get caught. Therefore, the habitual chance-taker, by th e simplest sort of elemen- tary logic, stands convicted as an irresponsible person. He is not safe, and if he controls the welfare of others, they are not safe. There are other kinds of irre sponsibility: failing to live up to obligations and discharge proper duties, dealing with money or figures carelessly, undertaking serious responsi- bility without proper qualif ications, rushing through dan- gerous episodes without considering possible conse- quences, failing to give proper attention to people and con- ditions, permitting needless waste, allowing an inequity to persist or refusing to right a wrong. Perhaps the most prevalent kind of dishonest irre- sponsibility is expressed in ordinary conversation. It is dishonest to handle facts or figures loosely, to make irresponsible statements, to gloss over the dangers of a serious situation, to establish false assumptions as tools of thought, to advance or defend an unsound judgment or po- sition, to employ trickery or chicanery, to be arbitrary or 84"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"bigoted, to neglect logic or co mmon sense, to compensate for lack of merit by use of pressure, to brush aside mistakes or refuse to admit error, to favor your interests unduly, to make an irresponsible promis e, to neglect a responsible promise once made, to blame your troubles on others, to justify yourself and your habits without regard to the facts, to betray a trust, to bear false witness or spread malicious gossip. One never knows when casual conversation will lead to serious results, and th ese days there is great need for seri- ous national and international conversations. Unfortunately some of that conversation comes from dishonest, misguided and malicious people. Perhaps the most dangerous persons in our midst are those who argue and plot for irresponsible changes in government policy or economic system or who lead us into traps set by unfriendly nations. What I am suggesting is no abridgment of free speech; it is a moral rather than a legal consideration. Remember that freedom of speech also permits freedom of dishonesty in speech. People had better learn to detect it when they encounter it. The easiest way is for a person to notice his own dishonest thoughts, c onversation and conduct. Honesty is being right instead of wrong in what a per- son thinks, says and does. Honesty comes from sensitizing the conscience and learning to follow it, and that is an intel- lectual process. Dishonesty is using wrong thoughts, words and meth- ods to advance personal motives. Dishonest words and deeds spring out of dishonest and distorted thoughts, and that puts a burden on the honest person to be aware in his mental processes. He should stop impulsively speaking or acting without checking, and he should continue checking until he has acquired habits of intellectual honesty. For the 85"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"person who aspires to be invul nerable, there is no other way. In the final analysis, it proves easier to be honest than to be dishonest. Moreover honesty is the essential key to every other virtue. Therefore, honesty should head the list of everybody’s personal assets. An honest person calculates his remarks and acts so that complete fairness results, avoids risks, makes important decisions responsibly, in- forms himself as to what is going on and is accountable. He conditions his responses so th at right performance becomes natural and instinctive. He cultivates and obeys every in- centive he knows is right and has confidence in the result that develops. He gives his hone st intent stimulation by es- pousing right action as it ar ises in his affairs. An honest person learns right techniques and masters the pertinent principles in every field where he makes im- portant decisions. When a choice is required, he resorts to honest principles instead of personal choices; principles are impersonal and infallible. He bases decisions on distinc- tions between right and wrong and stands uncompromis- ingly on the side of right. He postpones vital decisions until he knows what is right; then he proceeds without hesitation. Each person should search out examples of inadvertent dishonesty and get the habit of admitting shortcomings and mistakes, especially to hims elf. He should never pretend nor put up a bluff nor knowi ngly mislead. He should curb negative urges, control resent ment, stay calm, and not act nor speak in anger. He should refuse to reason from his emotional reactions, his pocketbook or desire for selfish gain. He should correct bad habits and stop doing what he thinks is wrong even when alone and unobserved. He should regard temptation as a time to practice self- discipline and train his consci ence to stand guard over his 86"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"behavior. By doing so, he develops a sound resolve against dishonesty in every form. The kinds of dishonesty unde r discussion may be diffi- cult to correct, but the person who corrects them takes a long step toward intellectual and emotional maturity. If so- ciety has to wait until the av erage person becomes mature, the present generati on should get busy. It is true that a per- son gains the full benefits of absolute right only when he has gone the whole way, but it is also true that correcting obvious abuses substantially improves the way his life un- folds. Obviously it is wrong and, theref ore, dishonest to steal. A person steals when he takes or accepts what is not his, even when he does it without committing an outright theft. That is a broad definiti on, but in the next lengthy sen- tence, I am going to make it broader. In essence, it is steal- ing to do any of the following: gain a reward under false pretense, pay too little for what is received, charge too much for what is sold, sell inferior merchandise to an un- suspecting consumer, keep what is found without seeking the rightful owner, accept or give an actual or implied bribe, fail to pay for dama ge you caused, unreasonably consume another person’s time and attention, pay a worker less than he earns, do less than is paid for, demand what you are not entitled to receive, fa il to give proper credit for a suggestion or an intangible benefit, pick a person’s mind to appropriate his ideas, defraud by deceit or chicanery, take unfair advantage or unr ightfully deprive anybody of a benefit of any sort. In other words, it is steali ng to appropriate an unearned and undeserved item unless, in fact, it is a gift. It is wrong to steal even for a good cause and equally wrong to accept or buy what someone else has stolen. 87"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"If a person thinks I was unduly harsh with the definition of stealing, he should reread the preceding paragraphs and ask how many of those things he would like done to him. Earlier in this chapter, I discussed the kind of dishon- esty that results from careles sness, negligence and irrespon- sibility. Next I shall discu ss the dishonesty of unbridled ambition. Basically there is nothing wrong with ambition. The world’s constructive work is done by ambitious people, but we have to eliminate unbrid led ambition. What is wrong about unbridled ambition is that its possessor bases his dis- tinctions between right and wrong on what he thinks will advance or retard his personal aims. He is ambitiously out for himself, and he puts what he considers his profit and advantage ahead of others’ welfare. When his self-chosen motives contradict the comm on good, somebody gets hurt. His thinking is twisted so that his unbridled ambition seems to justify whatever means he can effectuate. He may pursue his dishonest ambitions constantly or only occasionally. He may be dishonest in a thousand ways or in only one or two. To the precise extent a person seems to succeed by dishonesty, he renders his life unsafe. To the extent that he is dishonest, he succeeds only among dis- honest people. If his dishonest acts are frequent, they sen- tence him to associate with pe ople he cannot trust—a fact he does not learn until after he becomes honest. In the meantime, he is constantly on guard to protect his selfish interests. Here are examples of unbridled ambition: the customer who boorishly pushes ahead in lin e, the driver who tries to pass everything ahead of him, the traveler who arrives last but wants to board first, the arguer who insists on having the final word, the bragger who does all the talking and 88"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"wants all the applause, the vic tim of inferiority who inces- santly discusses his worth, the idea pirate who tries to grab the credit and profit from ever y joint endeavor, the associ- ate who kills every good idea he did not originate unless he is its prime beneficiary, the fellow worker who advances his career by sacrificing othe rs’ interests, the employee who substitutes talk for work, the fawn who flatters the vanity of superiors, the ma nager who surrounds himself with subordinates tacitly swor n to advance his ambitions despite the general good, the executive who misuses his authority for personal advantage. A person’s unbridled ambition may be observed in any or all such performances. Ofte n he confuses the issue by mixing honesty with his dishone sty, thereby disclosing that he has the capacity for honesty. He would do well to start exercising that capacity all al ong the line. Even the person who stoops to dishonesty only occasionally is easy to rec- ognize, because his dishonest procedures are transparent to detached observers. They do not take his lapses seriously, partly because they are often guilty of similar lapses and partly because our society is so thoroughly infested with sharp practices that people’s sense of honesty is somewhat dulled. I know persons who are sincer ely trying to base their lives on the principle of absolute right, and they testify that their lives are greatly improved as a result. They have dis- carded the dishonest tactics of unbridled ambition. People need to learn that only honest right action can bring invulnerability. Then th ey discover that duty and desire are truly identical, that pursuit of duty brings de- sired happiness and well-being, and that real freedom comes from thinking, saying and doing what is right. Un- 89"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"til that lesson is learned, peopl e continue to have more and more crises and catastrophes. Clearly the honest person refu ses to take or profit by any form of unfair advantage. He drops selfish ambitions and works for the common good. In doing so he discovers the secret of the ages, for he finds that calamity ignores him and visits the person who continues trying to get his own way. He understands that an ev ildoer can hurt only another doer of evil—a lesson difficult to discern only because so few persons have tested it. The principle of absolute right is no idle dream. It is based on a natural law. It is practical. I have seen enough people conform to it to know th at it is valid. I have also seen people reject it and c ontinue defending their biased definition that right is what favors them. Society has had to set up safeguards to confront those people with resistance. Often such persons meet that resistance by digging in for what they consider self-protection and thus become partici- pants in group dishonesty. If there is anything more da ngerous than individual dis- honesty, it is group dishonesty, because group dishonesty leads to organized dishonest y. There are pockets of organ- ized dishonesty everywhere—in governments, unions, business and industry, sports, professions as well as in every criminal activity that infests our social systems. The purpose of organized di shonesty is to substitute wrong for right. Chicanery, subterfuge, deceit and pressure are used to establis h a counterfeit right determined by dis- honest leaders to satisfy greed and build or perpetuate dis- honest advantage and power. Just as a bribe cannot be ef- fectuated unless there is a ta ker, organized dishonesty de- pends on cooperative action. Organized dishonesty is de- veloped and perpetuated by a network of reciprocal fa- 90"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"vors, by graft and corruption of officials, but above all, by the support and connivance of dishonest people. People don’t have to stand fo r organized dishonesty or allow it to exist. But they do. They countenance and often support it. The dishonest pers on is rewarded and his dis- honesty is made profitable. I know highly re spected men, pillars in their churches, who reward dishonest persons by giving them special privilege. In bestowing those privileges they must close their eyes to what they know is wrong. Occasionally a dishonest pe rson is given the opportu- nity to amass inordinate weal th. He is promoted for his cleverness, is voted into office, is patronized, and his enter- prises made profitable. T hus his dishonesty becomes a source of gain, which encourag es others to adopt similar ways to get their share of dis honest profit. Clea rly this sort of support for dishonesty shoul d be brought to a halt as quickly as possible. The truth is that a greate r number of average persons should stop supporting or contributing to the success of or- ganized dishonesty in any form, accepting advantages and favors of any dishonest group, becoming members of a pocket of organized dishonesty; and if they find themselves in one, to get out. There is no use trying to be hone st in a den of thieves. It can’t be done. A person either succumbs to temptation and makes himself a party to dishonesty or he gets out. When a person sees dishonesty, he should not move over and make room for it. Even loyalty to an employer or spouse does not demand that he support lies and double dealing. If he can- not think of any other remedy, he could change his loca- tion. 91"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"It is best to do what ought to be done and say what ought to be said to bring dishonest practices out into the open. Dishonesty does not thrive on publicity. The person with courage to tell the truth in the right way, provided he is not e xposing a dishonest group so strongly entrenched that he can be silenced, gets his way. He need only tell his story to people who are honest. When he cannot do that, he can tell it to people who want to be honest. With reasonable support, he can defeat any adver- sary forced to publicly defend a position that every honest person knows is wrong. I speak from considerable experience, having investi- gated many unfair business situat ions. None of which went uncorrected when the facts came to light. There is a philosophy of group action that keeps every- one out of trouble. Think, say or do nothing that works against the honest, common good—never neglect the rights of a single person. Seek the deci sion that is morally right. Every such decision is universally fair, and it automatically serves everybody’s proper interests. Wh en a person cannot find that decision, he is not qua lified to handle the problem. Every person has one true standard, and that standard is absolute right. To reason from another standard is dishonest. No per- son has a right to expect another to be dishonest. If he suc- ceeds, the other person becomes a part of the conspiracy. Collaborative or cooperative dis honesty is exactly as wrong as individual dishonesty, and no one can participate in or cooperate with dishonesty without being dishonest himself. In applying this knowledge, everybody is able to suit everybody, except those who pit their dishonest purposes against the common good. Nobody can suit them without becoming a dishonest partner. If a person cannot deal with 92"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"someone honestly, he is wise not to deal with that person at all. When enough people take that attitude, people’s dis- honesty will become unprofitabl e in every sense of the word. Perhaps the most clearly visi ble sign of organized dis- honesty is the constellation of symptoms that surrounds a pressure group. It was stated pr eviously that pressure is a substitute for facts and usua lly indicates that somebody is trying to advance a wrong cause . Pressure by government, industry, unions, polit ical parties, lobbyi sts, or any other special interest group is a sign of apprehension to settle an issue on its merits. Pressure is once removed from vio- lence, and both are poor substitutes for honesty. Every- body should know that individual s or groups resorting to pressure thereby convict themselves of dishonest intent. At the very least, they convict themselves of inability to use logic with good effect. There was a day when virtually all arguments were set- tled by pressure and conflic t: warfare, duels, kidnapping, murder and the like. As society became more civilized, courts were established so that disputes could be settled on their merits. When an unbiased court handles a dispute in- telligently, the result is good. Th e courts, however, are also subjected to dishonest pressure and whether they have pro- gressed or retrogressed over the years is questionable. Pressure is not needed to esta blish a valid point, at least, not when a fair hearing can be had. But is it possible to get a fair hearing on any vital public issue? Procedures for do- ing it are discussed later, and manifestly they should be ap- plied on a broad scale in our country and everywhere. 93"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Chapter 9 The Importance of Being Right Preceding chapters stated and inferred numerous rea- sons why it is important to be right. Right is what works without detriment of any sort, it encourages other people to get on the side of right, and it serves the best interests of everybody properly involved. It keeps a person out of trouble and gives him the courage of honest conviction. It provides a virtually infallible rule of conduct that guaran- tees high ethical standards in every phase of human rela- tions and, in fact, in every phase of life. It brings a person influence, progress, happiness, peace of mind. It draws on his highest faculties and best energies in every decision and every action he takes. It gi ves him appropriate words for every situation and pulls him through any crisis, but it does more than that. It prevents th e occurrence of a crisis result- ing from negligence or failure. The right thing to do is always the best, safest, and most expedient thing to do. When a person is right, he does not have to use force, pressure, pull, scheming or any other artificial method for winning hi s point. Because right action is to the best advantage of everybody involved, it is easy to facilitate. Doing what is wrong makes a person vulnerable. A wrong decision normally has to be reversed when the facts come to light, whereas a right decision is difficult or impossible to upset. Many serious crises result from people’s conflicts; therefore, this chapter will be devoted to that topic. I am going to discuss group conflict, especially the sort of group 94"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"conflict that has given us difficu lt labor relations. But, first, I shall present certa in fundamentals that can best be ap- proached by reference to individual conflict. If pressure is dishonest, so is conflict. Except for out- right physical self-defense, conf lict is generally a procedure of meeting opposition with wrong. That procedure is inde- fensible. The reasonable solution for conflict is to meet wrong with right. Because people trying to be right reason from the same reference points, conflict is not possible until wrong is somehow introduced. Except for solely physical combat, the tools of conflict are dishonesty, harassment, put-downs, slander, insults, such things as those. The object of fighting is to hurt. Obviously it is wrong to hurt a person, to damage his in terests, to injure his repu- tation, or even to abuse his em otional welfare. It is wrong to be discourteous, malicious, irresponsible, predatory or overly aggressive. It is wrong to create or perp etuate an in- equity, to arouse negative em otion, to stimulate a useless controversy, to substitute pers onal force for logic or to de- fend a wrong position. It is wr ong to hate, nurse a grudge, seek revenge, express anger or jealousy or to let negative emotion supplant intelligence. What is meant is that it is wrong to start a dispute, wrong to let a dispute start, wrong to keep a dispute alive and let a dispute continue. Practically all conf licts are caused by injustice or mis- understanding. Conflict starts when somebody is wrong in thought, word or deed. The wrong may be intentional or accidental; it may be real or imagined. An accidental or imagined wrong can cause as much damage as an inten- tional wrong, because any wrong is wrong. 95"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"If a person is cautious about preventing what is wrong, he does not get into conflicts. Instead he gets his life on the right track, and his plans flower and lead to accomplish- ment. Perhaps his success produces jealousy in others so that jealous persons may try to interfere. A jealous person cannot interfere until he has found an opening. By an open- ing, I mean a point on which th e other person is vulnerable, and the only way to be vulnerable is to be wrong. Until someone is wrong, there is no reason to fight. It is an old story that it takes two to fight. You may think that the person who does not fight when affronted must take a lot of pushing ar ound. That is not true. Popular assumption seems to be that when a person tu rns the other cheek, he invites another blow. He doesn’t. The person willing to turn the other cheek does not receive the first blow. Nobody is tempted to strike him because, on the whole, the person who does not fight does not invite attack. If he knows how to handle his human relations, he neither pushes nor is pushed. He can win or avoid an argument with any person who is off the track, and he does it by applying th e principle of absolute right. He knows that the sure way to defeat wrong is to hold right in contrast to wrong, that honesty defeats dishonesty, and that even a small group of right thinkers can defeat a large group whose might is supported by dis- honesty. People need to learn that the way to persuade is not to judge that an opponent is an adversary and then launch an attack. There are better ways. Start by giving yourself an objective viewpoint. Do not oppose a person; instead, op- pose only what is wrong. Dislike what he says, if you must, but do not dislike him. Recognize that it is not nec- essary to fight for right—only to state it. Set into motion 96"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"the forces of corrective actio n by recognizing and speaking the truth. No person can long withstand the continued on- slaught of carefully presented truth. It will finally compel recognition of error. It will fi nally reconcile the causes of misunderstanding and correct what is wrong. When a person engages in a fight, it is an admission that he has not lear ned a better way to manage his interper- sonal affairs. But there are stronger reasons for avoiding conflict, and I shall express them in elementary terms. If an opponent can be defeated, there is no need to fight. If he cannot be de feated, fighting is foolish. Unless a person is careful, he finds that he takes a licking even in the process of defeating an opponent. Despite these truths, the average person finds himself engaged in conflict at fre- quent intervals. There is a sequence to every conflict that is duplicated monotonously every day all over the earth. Few persons understand that sequence, but the person who does, so far as his own life is concerned, puts a stop to conflict. Conflict can be stopped before it starts and after it starts. It can be stopped at a ny step. Either adversary can stop it by simply resorting to friendly and honest responses rather than unfriendly and dis honest reactions. The first one to stop the conflict shows himself to be enlightened. The situation of conflict aris es when a person gives of- fense. That is most likely to happen after someone else in- vited offense, but conflict does not materialize until offense is taken. Here, then, is the formula to prevent conflict: Don’t give offense; don’t invi te offense; don’t take of- fense. The easy way to give offense is to make trouble for somebody, and the easy way to ma ke trouble is to think, say or do what is wrong. Maybe it is only emotional trouble 97"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"that is caused, but emotional trouble is what produces con- flict. Maybe it is only another person’s wrongness that in- vites someone to make troub le, but the person who is wrong needs help rather than to be attacked. That help is given by aiming high instead of low when dealing with people. Look for a way to reduce troubl e, not to in crease it. One summer day while entertaining fr iends, including my boss, my wife and I wanted to make favorable impressions, but the unexpected happened. The boss, resplendent in a white suit, picked up a wide smear of green paint from a ga rden chair. I saw it happen, saw him notice it, and tried to restrain my panic as he mut- tered a quiet word of chagrin. Then without attracting atten- tion from the other guests, he got up and started toward the house. Hurriedly, I followed. When I caught up, he realized I knew of his predicament. At once the response of a good friend came forth, “I’m certainly glad that happened to me and not someone else.” The person who does not take offense never gets into fights. The person who tries to conduct his relationships on that basis does not get into fights. As will be discussed later, trying is virtua lly equal to succeeding. Long experience has demonstrat ed that there are times when a person has to resist s udden temptation: to react to a slur with a scornful retort, to puncture someone’s ego, de- flate him and put him down. Often that can be done so that bystanders laugh and applaud. But take out the rush of ideas to bring laughter and appl ause, and what is left is rather ugly. The scornful reto rt upsets the other person’s reason, causing him to behave in a belligerent manner so that the sequence of conflict is then in full swing. Conflict 98"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"is avoided by understanding treatment from either or both participants. A popular fallacy has it that when a person is struck, he is entitled to strike back. The fact is every blow invites a stronger blow. Immediately each opponent must get even, and his idea of getting even is to hurt his opponent more than he was hurt. The thrusts and counterthrusts may fall in rapid succession or may be as widely spaced as the moves in a chess game played by mail. There is only one outcome. The conflict runs its full course until one antagonist ga ins sufficient advantage that he loses interest, loses his nerv e and retreats, or is dead. In other words it continues until one antagonist believes he has won and the other has lost. Fighting is no way to settle a moral issue. In fact, it is an invitation to the less sc rupulous antagonist to do his worst. In addition, each thrust a nd counterthrust invites bad feeling. Even when a person is right at the outset, indigna- tion and temper soon cloud the mind. There is no such thing as truly righteous indi gnation, for when a person loses his temper, rationality goes along. The next step is to meet wrong with wrong, and to that extent, a person becomes vulnerable. After that, personal force is needed to carry his cause, and that cannot be done in the face of honest opposi- tion. Therefore, what is called fo r is a return to rationality. The sensible procedure is to break off the conflict and let right prevail. Either antagonist can do it. When it is done, the antagonist who is wrong finds his position un- dermined. Rightness wins the point. Recently I was driving through an unfamiliar town in heavy traffic, searching for a certain side street. Conse- quently I stayed to the extreme right and passed three con- secutive streets before I found my turn. A patrol car pulled 99"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"up beside me and forced me to the curb. I got out and ap- proached the policeman. “Evidently I did something wrong,” I said. “You can say that again,” he grumbled. “Let me see your license!” While producing it, I took my time so I could think about what I might say. “Let me explain what I was doing,” I said, “and I think you’ll unde rstand. I was looking for the Y.M.C.A., and I knew it was off to the right on one of the streets I passed. Perhaps you t hought I was trying to pass traffic on the right.” The officer’s attitude underw ent a complete change. He became friendly and helpful. In a few words he told me where to find the Y.M.C.A., apologized, and we parted friends. What this story illustrates is that the person who is tak- ing right action needs only to st ate his case. In dealing with any fair-minded person, he gets what he should without ar- gument. The only time such tactics do not cause right to prevail is when wrong is deeply entr enched or strongly organized. Then a person needs support from a judge and jury honest enough to see that right purposes are served. Telling the truth does it, and the response is much like what happens when a hungry crowd is called to dinner. Failure occurs only when a person cannot get a hearing from honest peo- ple. With the foregoing as a preliminary, let us devote the next few pages to the topic of conflict in labor relations. Often I have had to settle disputes between industrial workers and management. There is only one procedure I have ever followed: Talk to the key individuals, and get everybody’s complete story. Wh ile each person is blowing 100"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"off his emotional steam, collect all the facts. Find out what is right and what is wrong in the situation. Find ways to prove what is right or wrong. With that knowledge, get all the individuals to recognize an d correct errors in their thinking. As a result, only one answer has ever emerged, and it is an answer that is acceptable to everybody. By using that procedure, I have never had to act as judge or jury, never had to pose as attorney for the prosecu- tion or defense, never had to arbitrate, and never had to en- force a decision. Every decisi on was arrived at voluntarily and enforced itself by unanimous mutual consent. The foregoing routine was applied hundreds of times to hundreds of problems with no exception in the result. A dispute starts when a person, perhaps more than one, is wrong. It is corrected only when those who are wrong become right. There is a key point that makes every decision easy: A person instin ctively wants to do what he knows is right. If that statem ent seems incorrect, it is only because few persons have had the opportunity or patience to go through such analyses themselves. Afte r having seen that routine work consistently, I have complete confidence in it. Of course, any dispute is so mewhat confusing at first. Perhaps there are as many sides as participants and many fallacious arguments. But underl ying all the verbiage there is a thread of basic truth that is convincing to everybody once it is exposed. Seldom must a person expose it himself. By asking intelligent questions, the truth gradually is brought out. If anyone hampers another’s progress toward what is right, his embarrassment can progressively be increased until he is willing to face truth. If he resists what is reason- able, he can be asked, “Do you want to do what is right?” I 101"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"have met many people whose emotions were difficult to manage but none who was willing to answer by saying no. I have learned that few disputes are settled by others with the procedure just desc ribed. In many disputes, no ef- fort is made to collect all th e facts. Instead, disputes are won by the disputants able to exert greatest pressure and are lost by the disputants who lack strategic advantage. The truth is a dispute should not be won or lost; it should be resolved. That is accomplished by the direct application of honesty. No participant in conflict is likely to accept the fact that conflict is resolved by the simp le application of honesty on both sides. But it is true. The reason is that conflict grows out of intentional or uninte ntional dishonesty and cannot thrive unless the dishonesty is allowed to persist. Uncon- sciously each side tends to pe rpetuate its dishonest stance. The simplest way to resolve group conflict is to bring in a truly impartial mediator whose objective is to see that the facts become clear to everybody involved. His job is to see that right prevails, and that is his only job. To do that, he must expose error, exagge ration, misunderstanding, false statements and truth. He does it without stating any issue under dispute, leaving that to the disputants themselves. It often helps to ask questions: “Are you trying to do the right thing?” “Will you accep t the right answer when it emerges?” Such questions impel disputants to declare their intention to be fair. Similarly statements of principle generate fairness and confidence: “When the right answer is found, it will suit everybody involved.” “The person who makes a mistake needs help more than he needs to be hurt.” 102"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"A true mediator never takes sides. If he does, he adds pressure to what the opposing si de thinks it must defeat. No longer is he a mediator; he is party to the dispute. I have used the foregoing procedures for settling nu- merous labor disputes, involving unions and companies known to be tough. After emotions cooled, never have they failed to bring a satisfactory solution to everybody in- volved. The reason is twofold: An impartial questioner dis- closes information that shows error whether it results from misunderstanding or from intent; second, almost nobody will openly convict himself of being dishonest. He is not willing to say, “I know I’m wrong, but I insist on my point anyhow.” Those principles refer to la bor disputes, and the same principles apply to negotiati on of most labor contracts. With contracts, the dispute is artificial in nature. It does not arise from a local situation of real or imagined wrong- ness, injustice or misunderstan ding as in the case of a dis- pute between a worker and hi s foreman. Instead, one side sets up demands and the other side sets up resistance, re- sulting in conflict that is almost always settled on the basis of pressure. The conflict could be resolved by exposing what is right and letting it prevail—so long as the dispu- tants’ representatives are willing to be honest. Sometimes an honest result is not acceptable to all the representatives’ constituents, and then it has to be regarded as a “mutually unsatisfactory” result. I have seen that sort of result develop more than on ce, and it is the only conces- sion that is morally right, because it is a concession to hon- esty. The trouble is that people seldom employ collective bargaining procedures that ach ieve the kind of honest set- tlement described in these pages. 103"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Some persons may scoff at that statement. “What about fact-finding committees?” they may ask. The answer is that even when the fact finders ar e right, a fact-finding commit- tee ordinarily is used for exer ting pressure. That pressure is resisted by everybody in a position to resist. “What about impartial umpi res?” may be another ques- tion. The answer is that an umpire makes a binding deci- sion, which a fact-finding committee usually cannot, and as a result, it is virtually impo ssible to get an umpire ap- pointed. The disputants are se ldom willing to surrender use of their pressu re tactics. “What about arbitrators?” may be a third question. The answer to that question is more complicated to explain. It is my observation that an arbitrator too often is one who makes an arbitrary decision. He tries to give a piece of the victory to each contestant on the theory that if each gets a concession the arbitrator may be hired again. His usual function is to mark out the area of a dispute at the time he enters it; then he finds some way to give mutu- ally satisfactory concessions until no dispute remains. Thus contradictory pressure finally decides the outcome, and the arbitrator is only a shock reducer. What is right rarely has anything to do with the outcome. A right decision is not reached by appeasement, by horse-trading, by compromise or by concessions. It is reached by exposing the facts and letting them control. It must be done in a way that enables each disputant to recog- nize the facts for himself. They cannot be jammed into the mind of a person who is so ex cited he cannot distinguish right from wrong. I think that conventional pr ocedures for settling labor disputes are wrong. I hold that when every party to a dis- pute is properly represented and all the facts are clear in 104"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"everybody’s mind, the right decision goes with the facts. Only when one or more of the disputants is willing to be publicly dishonest and to seek support for his dishonesty do decisions go wrong. Several years’ experience with both unions and man- agement and with executives and labor convinces me that the foregoing program is entirely practical. And that it is not just an ivory- tower dream. I have been involved in many labor disputes and numerous negotiations of labor contracts, and every one of th em was settled in the manner described. Everybody needs to know that the most important thing in this world is to be right. The second most important thing is to get others to be right also. Right can always be defended, can hardly be criti- cized, can seldom be overru led. But wrong makes you vulnerable, undermines the stre ngth of your position, in- vites others to knock you down, and provides the very tools for doing it. The benefit of right thought and right action is limitless. The penalty of wrong thought and wrong action is destruc- tion. A person who lives by the principle of absolute right bears a charmed life. When a person gets on the wrong track, life becomes complicated and impossible to manage; but when he is on the right tr ack, his activities succeed. It is as simple as it sounds. I have cited enough benefits to assure that it is wise to be right, but I have saved th e greatest benefit until last. Earlier it was stated that c onforming to the principles of absolute right enables a person always to do what he wants to do to the exclusion of doing what he does not want to do. Perhaps that seemed to be a selfish philosophy. It is. But at the same time, it is wholly unselfish—which seems contra- 105"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"dictory until the meanings of those two words are under- stood. Right is an exact quality, and on every basic issue, there is an identity between what benefits the individual and what benefits humanity as a whole. When people learn to reconcile selfishness with unselfishness, we will have our better world. The perfect way of accomplishing that reconciliation is to conform to the principle of absolute right. Surely that must be the meaning of the admonition, “Love thy neighbor as thyself.” Love not more nor less, but as thyself. Right and expediency are identical. So are right and might. So are unselfishness a nd selfishness. The person who comprehends those truths is the one who improves our world by improving his own. He always has plenty of in- teresting and productive things to do, because the opportu- nity to do what is right is in bountiful supply in our world today. To do what is right, therefore, is the natural for- mula for having a spectacular career and fulfilling exis- tence. 106"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Chapter 10 How To Make an Honest Decision This chapter presents an approach to right thinking that many persons will find helpful in opening dramatic oppor- tunities. Of all the concepts in this book, what follows is most likely to be thought controve rsial. It is open to skepti- cism on the ground that its valid ity is not confirmed by the average person’s experience. There are two ways to con- firm its validity: one is to check its logic, and the other is to put it to use and gain that experience. Previously I asserted that the sum total of a person’s duty is to think, speak and act in conformity with the prin- ciple of right because it is based on a natural law: right ac- tion gets right results; wrong action gets wrong results. I asserted that the person who bases decisions on distinctions between right and wrong does wh at he wants to do, because then there is an identity be tween what he wants to do and what is right. His life is protected, and in this chapter, it will be shown that sincere intent to do what is right is all that is required. The average person does not know that freedom of choice consists of the ability conscientiously to think, say and do what is right. In this nation, pe ople are allowed to exercise that freedom, and the only time they lose it is when they do what is wrong. Few persons know that, con- sequently few take advantage of that freedom. People are restrained by fear ful thoughts, so they think they dare not quit their jobs, although many would be wise 107"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"to branch out for themselves. They think they dare not en- gage in competition, although ma ny would find they have no competition. They think they dare not speak their minds, although they would find that truth cannot be assailed. They think they dare not ac t on honest purposes, although they would discover that honest purposes succeed. When making decisions, the average person fails to ask himself what is right. Instead he asks himself what would please him. He thinks with his pride, his prejudices, his pocketbook. When selfish ambition is the basic ingredient of a decision, he gets a wrong answer, leading to a wrong result. Despite the wrongness of that result, he may set out to prove his decision was right. That explains how a person gets into much of his trouble. Freedom of choice implies ability to make voluntary decisions, but that ability is he dged in by a vital restriction. The individual should not act on wrong decisions. Every question has many possible wrong answers and only one answer that is right. To the person who lives by absolute right, the right question determines the right answer. The right answer is predestined. Asking the right question, therefore, is vital and leads to another illuminating discov- ery. A complicated problem is not solved readily until the problem is captured in an accu rately stated question. Often the question so clearly predesti nes the answer that the an- swer is obvious at once. Just as the right question predes- tines the right answer, the pr oblem predestines the right question. The problem predetermines the question, and the ques- tion predetermines the answer. Therefore, the sequence be- gins with the problem a nd not with the question. 108"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Suppose, for example, a house were on fire. That would constitute a problem, and it woul d give rise to several ques- tions. In one way or another, those questions would con- cern what to do. Several answer s in combination would be right. Call the fire department, save whatever valuables you rightly can, start fighting th e fire and so on, depending on conditions. But the facts of the fire and the local conditions determine both the questi ons and the answers. What this means is that re alistically a person does not make a decision. Instead, he finds it. He collects, analyzes, and interprets the facts. Those facts are captured in cor- rectly worded questions. Then the answers are found. The decision is the result. By fo llowing correct procedure, any two persons in the same situation get the same decision. The foregoing example provides a principle, a universal truth: Right decisions are found, not made. The principle applies to every problem no matter how complicated, al- though often it may be difficult to trace out in detail. In the field of human relations, for example, that prin- ciple is only the confirmation of an earlier statement that when handling labor problems, it is essential to find the facts and assure that they control. The person who accepts the reality of the principle and allows for it discovers a vast improvement in the management of any problems he is called on to solve. Every right answer is deter mined by a right question, and every right question is dete rmined by correct interpre- tation of a problem. Seemingly the sequence of analysis begins with a prob- lem, but only for a person who lets his problems be selected by the vicissitudes of life. Such a person is not truly free; his problems, questions, and answers (if effectively han- dled) are predetermined by f actors beyond his control. The 109"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"way to escape and gain freedom from such problems is to select project problems. As many successful inventors or creative thinkers have learned, that creates a rewarding oc- cupation. There is a simple procedure for converting the forego- ing paragraphs into action. Cons tantly search out important project problems, and capture them on paper in specific form as a normal part of living. When the opportunity arises, select one for treatment. Select the problem project you think you can handle: envi- ronmental, social, political, or relationship problem. Be sure that the selection combines complete selfishness with complete unselfishness. Convert the project problem into the question that is dictated by it, then convert the question into its correct answer. Enough persons doing that repeat- edly would change the world. In following the foregoing procedure, a person never has confusion over what to do next. He gradually discovers that his life begins expressing a natural plan. To others his life may look extremely complicated, but to him it looks simple. He sees a clear path of action stretching ahead that makes sense, therefore, he follows it. That procedure gives anybody’ s path of life a high de- gree of purposeful strength. Pe ople who might seek to deter or dissuade may consider su ch persons stubborn perhaps, which only shows their lack of similar understanding. Any- one who finds the perfect formula that combines maximum self-interest with maximum serv ice to others could not be dissuaded nor deterred. The fact is that in the ideal life there is an identity be- tween selfishness and unselfishness; therefore, by implica- tion, there is an identity between predestination and free will. 110"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"By exercising his freedom of choice, the individual un- erringly follows the path of ac tion that is best for him and for humanity as a whole. In th e final analysis, that is what determines his choice. In doing so he achieves a grand pre- destination in his affairs by working from an assumption that his will is free. He also discovers what freedom really means: The person who chooses to be right is free, and any other so-called freedom ac tually is a form of unsus- pected slavery. That slavery is explained in later pages. Perhaps the strongest point expressing the concept of free will is the individual’s consciousness of freedom to make choices. Because serious thinkers, through the centu- ries, have argued the subject of predestination versus free will, I shall devote the next few pages to its consideration. Consciousness is the awaren ess of our surroundings. It is also the ability to remember and to deal in abstract con- cepts. Perhaps consciousness serves its highest function in relation to decisions, and a rriving at a right decision is perhaps the best example of a free will at work. If the will were not free, w hy would a person need to be conscious? If decisions were automatic, why would he need any more consciousness than a calculator? Surely con- sciousness is not provided mere ly so that people could en- joy and suffer. Instead, consciousness epitomizes people’s ability to discern choices in the practical situations of life. In a very real sense, consciou sness is the stuff of life. The person who decides to live under an assumption that his will is free is, from that moment, conscious of free- dom. He increases that consciousness of freedom by exer- cising it. Soon he discovers that free functioning of his conscious ability to choose what is right brings whatever he needs. He discovers that money and materi al things are as free as wa- 111"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"ter and air, and that only self-a pplied restrictions in the past use of his freedom have denied him what he needed. From this, a person can deduce that feelings of frustration are a sign that he is not exercising his freedom. Consciousness is evidence of free will and evidence of opportunity to make free choices. Therefore, it is evidence of the ability to choose between right and wrong. He who chooses wrong loses his freedom . That information narrows freedom of choice; only the choice of right will do. There- fore, people are free to choose right but not wrong. Thus consciousness is limited so that only the right thinker per- petuates and extends his freedom. Freedom is the opportunity to choose what is right. If life is viewed as an unceasing series of problem situations, then freedom is the opportunity to get the right answers. When life is conducted in accordance with a long series of right decisions, that has the effect of giving life a perfect destiny. The destiny is not necessaril y fixed in advance, for one wrong decision destroys that destiny, and then a new one is established. The destiny is an ideal rather than a literal pre- determination. It represents th e individual’s path of perfect opportunity, and if he finds a nd acts on right decisions all along the line, he fulfills life’s destiny for him. Once a person sees the reasoning behind those con- cepts, he tends to absorb them into his pattern of life. Some things are predestined by nature such as the fact that the morning sun appears on the eastern horizon or that winter follows autumn. But a person often takes a hand in destiny himself. He may take action that predestines, for example, the time of his death, he may toss a ball into the air and predestine its return to earth, or predestine his size by the amount and kind of food he eats. It is a matter of 112"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"cause and effect. Establish a natural cause, and the effect arises in due course. If life is a series of ch oices in accordance with the principle of absolute right, th en each person has a perfect path of life stretching out before him. Given the opportu- nity, his life plans itself. What if he gets off the right track? If he does, the same is true. He continues to experience an unending series of opportunities for right choices. His path may be different, but it will still be a perfect path. His task is to find it. Unless hi s wandering involves irrevocable damage, all he loses is time. That loss in itself is irrevoca- ble, but it does not necessarily change the nature of his fu- ture. His perfect future is found by getting on the right track and staying there. It is a human tendency to be lieve in deta iled planning. People are instructed and encouraged to set goals and work out plans for achieving them. To achieve the perfect life, people do not need detailed blueprints made up in advance. In fact, to set a goal beco mes more than a device for achieving that goal. It becomes a device for causing any other goal to be inadmissibl e. There may be other goals more useful and inspiring. Few persons of greatness have claimed they planned it all in their youth. I have shown that the pers on who constantly searches for opportunities, who at each new step selects the most important opportunity for treatment, and who then makes right choices surrenders his de stiny to natural forces. He should check his decisions with common sense as he goes along, but in doing so, his common sense may get some shocks. He finds that nature is a better planner than a per- son. 113"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"He discovers that he knows what to do next, has what- ever abilities and facilities he needs, and finds they come with little or no forethought on his part. Every person who tries the life of right choices accumulates his own proof of those assertions and concludes that nature is a more vital force than he supposed. He soon realizes that this world’s troubles result from the fact that people try to conduct their lives as though they were omniscient and sometime s omnipotent. Thereafter he is content to entrust his destiny to a power higher than him- self, knowing that incessant right choices will lead him wherever he should go. He has no qualms about the future. For me, the preceding information settles the age-old argument over predestination and free will. But whether the will is free is a somewhat academic question. The answer makes little practical difference, though what a person thinks is the answer makes a great deal of difference. What he thinks determines his conduct. If he thinks he can be of service to others and to hims elf by exercising his free will, he will exercise it. While the foregoing pages may be considered contro- versial, the reason for including them is that they could help readers to aim toward high accomplishment with suf- ficient confidence to hurdle the obstacles. What is coming next, I thi nk, is not controversial. The purpose of this chapter is to show how decisions should be made. It helps to know that decisions are prede- termined by relevant facts. It is also necessary to have a sound procedure for collecting and understanding those facts. The next few pages will discuss such a procedure. The first step is to determine when a decision is appro- priate. In that connection it he lps to recognize that the aver- age person seldom makes a complicated decision until he is 114"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"driven to it. He lets most deci sions go by default, and that is true whether the benefits woul d be his or society’s as a whole. In addition, most of the average person’s decisions are based on impulse rather than reasoning. No matter what is said, he continue s doing it that way. Fortunately impulse is frequently as good a basis for ac- tion as reasoning if certain considerations are observed. When a decision is demanded, it should not be ne- glected. If the facts are clea rly understood and the decision falls within the individual’s normal scope of operation, an impulsive decision will suffice. An impulsive decision is readily checked for accuracy, an d the habit of checking it can be made instinctive. The procedure for doing it is sim- ple: Determine that the decision is based on an honest impulse in touch with reality. For the most part, only the reason behind the decision is vital. Find that reason and inspect it. If it is what the situa- tion calls for, the decision will be honest. If it is honest, it will be right. To check the honesty of a decision, consider these ques- tions: Does the decision disr egard others’ rights? Does it contradict duty to self? Does it truly satisfy the best inter- ests of all persons properly involved? To check the honesty of the action based on the decision, try this question: Will the action benefit me, others, or a combination of every- body involved? An honest answer to that question often inspires an improvement in the decision at once. Wrong decisions are based on false premises or on dishonest personal motives. A decision calculated to effec- tuate wrong invariably leads to wrong results. That is true if the decision is based on a desi re to appear smart, get even, take unfair advantage, to hurt, or to do anything else classi- fied as dishonest in Chapter 8. Honest decisions made in 115"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"conformity with the principles of right behavior will nec- essarily be right. No person who is careless, irresponsible, slipshod or thoughtless in approaching problems can expect to get right decisions. Nor can a person whose motives and habits of thought are biased. But everyone becomes both cautious and unbiased when he starts th inking in terms of absolute right. He solves his problems on the basis of simple distinc- tions between right and wrong, because he perceives those distinctions. When he experi ments by dealing with prob- lems within his scope of experience, he finds that he is vir- tually infallible. Then he discovers that he can extend his virtual infallibility to other areas of his life. He should intend to be right in all his big and little deci- sions. An easy way to approach that degree of right intent is to espouse right moral causes in daily affairs. Gradually life itself assumes the nature of a right moral cause. That will bring help of the most valuable sort from other people who also are trying to be right. What has already been expl ained simplifies most of life’s decisions to a point of understandability. There are, however, certain complicated problems that will be dis- cussed next. At first glance, some problems appear easy to solve while others appear difficult. A difficult problem is diffi- cult only when a person is not able to manage it readily. If he keeps trying to understand the problem, it will become easy. He starts by locating the essential points, making them so obvious and clear th at any unbiased observer or listener would agree with them. By the time a person has done that with every essentia l point, the problem becomes as easy to handle as multiplying numbers, and he feels as- sured of the correctness of the result. 116"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Consider the worker who must decide whether to resign his position and go into busine ss for himself. Consider the executive who must decide whether or not to fire a subor- dinate. Consider the great pub lic problems that must be solved by our national leaders. All those problems could be handled in the manner described. Often it is said that there is no such thing as a perfect solution to any problem. Suppose the problem is to put a car in a garage, to arrive on time for an appointment, to add a column of figures? Suppose the problem is to find the sum of one and one? The answer is two. Could Einstein do better? There is a perfect solution to every ordinary problem, and the task is to find it. To accomplish that task, the analy- ses must be simple and understandable. The way to be right is to collect and interpret the ap- propriate facts. Get them all. Then making a decision is only a matter of defining the problem, putting it into the form of a question, and finding the answer to the question. The procedures of arithmetic really tell the story. Every problem should be reduced to the simplest de- gree of understandability. Until it is, no pe rson is qualified to deal with it. In addition, if other people’s welfare de- pends on the outcome, attempting to do so shows irrespon- sibility. Here is a procedure that embodies the foregoing sug- gestions: 1. Recognize your probl ems as they arise, record them on paper, arrange them in sequence of importance, and give them treatment in a systematic manner. 2. Reduce each problem to one or more specific questions that allow for every vital fact, then impr ove their wording until they define the problem exactly. 3. Collect all the facts, princi- ples, ideas and other pertinent data that are needed to an- 117"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"swer the questions, and discar d the rest. 4. Combine, rear- range, organize, and simplify th e data until the combination that arouses greatest confid ence is found. 5. Convert that combination into a specific plan of action and execute it. Some persons may think I have oversimplified the pro- cedure of making a decision. Many decisions, they may say, are more complicated than that. Not the vital decisions. It is years since life has conf ronted me with any decision more complicated than the av erage bridge hand. While my bridge decisions are not vital, I attach great significance to every decision that may alter the course of my life. Those decisions, I have found, are simple when one’s intent is to think, say and do what is right. Some choices are absolute, as is a choice between right and wrong. When a person faces such a choice, it should be made without equivocation. Bu t other choices are between good and bad, and some are between bad and worse. The basis of those choices is a standard of comparison. The standard of comparison is illustrated by the markings on a ruler or on the scale of a thermometer. The average person makes up his own scale ordina rily, but he should adopt a scale made up from life. An existing standard may pr ovide a suitable basis from which to work, but if a person wants a method that is better, quicker, cheaper or fairer, for example, he has to measure comparative values. The better method should be adopted, and it should be the best method that can be found. Above all, it should be an honest me thod with the distinctions be- tween right and wrong that are clear-cut. When a person gets an answer that gives him confi- dence from the moral viewpoint, he is invulnerable to trou- ble. Either he has that confid ence or he does not. When he doesn’t, he needs further analys is and experiment. When in 118"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"doubt, it is best for him to continue cautious analyzing. No- body should take an irrevocable step until he knows he is safe. That procedure protects the best interests of every- body involved, and it constitutes a good definition of hon- esty in handling important problems. At this point, I am going to add a touch of philosophy. There is a giant sleeping within the average person that is a genius. Perhaps the average person thinks he cannot do much to increase his intelligence as such, but he can in- crease his honesty and get much the same result. Thus he awakens the sleeping giant which gives him the effect of genius, too. A genius is a person who know s how to be right. That makes all his decisions sound. Several times in foregoing pa ges, I have indicated that the individual is capable of virtual infallibility. I have said that the intent to be right is virtually equal to the actuality, and next I shall explain those assertions. A person should expect a perfect performance from himself and be disappointed wh en he doesn’t get it. Too often the average person shrugs off mistakes with a remark to the effect that it is human to err. Too often he denies or defends his mistakes. That attit ude is an invitation to self- deception. The fact is that a person cannot be totally accurate in all details of his thoughts and speec h. He cannot be perfect in all he does. His job is to be right as comprehensively as he can, and there is no more that anyone can do. He cannot afford to be slipshod about trying. Every time he excuses, denies or defends a mistake, he paves the way to additional mistakes of the same kind. Those mistakes fall into catego- ries, built up by a long series of excuses, denials and de- fenses. Nobody should kid himself about that. 119"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"Once a habitual mistake is discovered, it is easy to cor- rect, and the correction puts an end to that series of mis- takes. While it is true that a pers on cannot be perfect in every detail of his thoughts and their expression, he can be right in the fundamentals. When he is right in the fundamentals, which means when he is honest about every consideration that comes along, surprising results develop. He finds that life does not demand perfection. A person does not have to be perfect to get the effect of perfection. That may seem like a strange concept, but it stands up un- der analysis. When a person is dealt a bri dge hand, he is confronted with the need to make a deci sion. He must pass or make a bid on which he will shortly stand or fall. That kind of situation seldom arises in life. Usually the process of mak- ing a decision can be protecte d by preliminaries so man- aged that they cause no irrevocable harm. A person can ad- just and readjust his actions as he proceeds. By constantly edging himself in the direction of what is right and check- ing himself at frequent interv als, he stays out of trouble. Other people, seeing his intent to do what is right, tend to make allowances for any mistakes that may occur. Unless they have wrong motives, they help him to stay on the right track. The right solution to any problem is one that is honest, fair and satisfactory to ever y person involved, and in reach- ing that solution, there is usually adequate margin for unin- tentional error. Nature has tolerance for well-meaning mistakes: A scrape or cut heals itself. That same tolerance is shared by every right-thinking person. It is read on every blueprint of a manufactured product: The parts do not have to be perfect 120"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"but must only fall within the required fraction of an inch. If they do, that is acceptable. To all intents and purposes, the product is perfect. Approaching the solution of a problem is somewhat analogous to the situation of a ferryboat entering its slip. The boat may approach from upstream or down, it may be pointed toward dead center or off to one side, it may scrape against the pilings on either si de, it may move slowly or at maximum safe speed. If necessary adjustments are made during the process of docking it, the boat eventually as- sumes the right position so that proper mechanical cou- plings are made. Ordinarily the ferryboat pilot must be clumsy indeed to get into trouble. The same is true of everybody in virtually all the ordinary situations he faces. The person who gets into frequent trouble is someone who is not trying to do what is right. His mind is on get- ting his way, and that takes his thinking off the track. His task is to stop trying to get his way and instead to find the right track and stay on it. Then no matter what his past mis- takes, so long as none is ir revocable, his life begins to straighten out. He is wise to correct any past mistakes or, at least, to compensate for them when he can. That lets him forget them, and his life becomes blameless and free. 121"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Chapter 11 The Great Cost of Being Wrong In many persons’ minds, the impression prevails that dishonesty can be made profitable. If this book accom- plishes its purpose, it wi ll correct that impression. Dishon- esty benefits nobody. At best , it is a trick for obtaining something of seeming value in exchange for what is priceless. It is easy for a person to believe he has gained by taking wrong action. If he conducts a successful burglary, for ex- ample, he can spend the proceeds on whatever he wants. He can do the same with profits fr om any dishonest action if he is not caught. No doubt about th at. But there are other ways to get what a person wants, involving less risk. Occasion- ally books are written by criminals who have made that discovery by turning honest. Most people would like to believe that wrong action that violates the law doesn’t pay, but despite its logic, there are some who scoff. “I know a dishonest man,” one may say, “whose dishonesty made him rich. While his victims struggle financially, he thumps his chest and brags about how smart he is. What can be said about that?” There are three things to say. First, or dinarily nobody can cheat persons who are honest ; dishonest persons profit by appealing to somebody’s cupidity. Second, dishonest persons cut themselves off fr om the good life in ways al- ready explained. If they live long enough, the quicksands of dishonesty swallow them. Thir d, it is almost universally agreed that a person’s success is due to what is right about 122"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"his methods rather than what is wrong. The fact that people mix wrong with right only s hows how much further they could have deviated in their quest for profitable advantage. Invariably the wrongdoer is one of his victims. Seldom does he realize it, and because of that fact, he is led astray by a gigantic delusion. Seldom is he resentful over his own misdeeds, but when he is their victim, he deeply resents the misdeeds of others. First, he must admit he is in trouble, and for that reason, he should turn the tables and consider his own misdeeds. That is what I propose to demonstrate in this chapter. Words and deeds are under c ontrol of the brain. There- fore, the wrongdoer is a wrong thinker. No matter how successful he appears to be, the wrong thinker is a slave to his wrongness. He makes many plans that cannot work out. He is torn between duty and desire. His life is filled with tension and internal friction. He cannot achieve iden- tity between selfishness and unselfishness. He can rarely do as he pleases. To meet the requ irements of life, he must of- ten do what he would rather avoid. One of his problems is that other people tend to deprive him of opportunities. When hone st people get his number, they ignore or frustrate him. Honest people do not associate with him on free and easy terms, and usually they tactfully conceal that fact from him. There are individuals who go through life as failures because they have thus destroyed other people’s confidence in them, and most of them never know why. Intent to be honest permits easy detection of dishonesty in others. Figuratively it dest roys the blinders on a person’s eyes so that he can identif y a dishonest person by the way he runs a business, the way he deals with people and man- ages his personal affairs. Th ere are people who have been 123"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"so habitually dishonest that a discerning stranger can read the evidence in their faces and demeanor. That is a high price to pay for questionable gain. It is possible to recognize dishonesty in a person’s con- versation by the contradictions he voices. It is recognized in exhibitions of jealousy, expressions of self- aggrandizement, attitudes of resentment or defense, efforts to conceal motives and displays of aggression. The dishonest person is likely to invite dis putes and to have trouble in getting them se ttled. Therefore, one of the penalties of dishonesty is a succession of arguments, con- troversies and conflicts. Along with inviting disput es, the dishonest person makes wrong decisions, having adverse effects on the in- terests of others. However, when the facts come to light, a wrong decision practically co mpels its own correction. The way to avoid wrong decisions is to adopt the in tent to be right, and the way to do that is to be honest. Conscience must be brought into full play. It must be sensitized and used. There is no such thing as too much honesty nor too much conscience. The drive of conscience is emotional. The person who disregards that drive may think he can somehow nullify its force. He cannot. The force will exert itself somewhere, and unless it is used as nature intended, the result is harm- ful. The person who tries to i gnore his conscience is con- stantly confused between duty and desire. Consequently he suffers endless frustration and inner conflict that under- mines his emotional well-being. The fully honest person is emotionally secure. He withstands emotional strains. He lives without fear. His in- tent to think, say and do what is right makes him invul- 124"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"nerable to other people’s trou ble, and he doesn’t cause trouble for himself. A generation ago, almost any doctor would have scoffed at the idea that physical illness has emotional ori- gins. Today many of them agr ee that a large proportion of sicknesses have emotional origins. That conclusion is con- firmed by several formerly sickly persons of my acquaint- ance who have learned to satisfy the promptings of con- science and regained their health. It is a tired joke that the person who needs a doctor has something wrong with him, and the person who needs a psychiatrist ought to have his head examined. But the evi- dence is that when people learn to be honest, their doctors become less overworked. Such are the emotional and physical problems of dis- honesty, and the benefits of the person who cleanses his mind of wrong thoughts. Earlier I stated that conscious guilt tends to alter a per- son’s conduct and demeanor so that his dishonesty is ob- servable. Though harder to detect, unconscious guilt is just as obvious to the discerning eye. Unconscious guilt results from dishonest thinking, dis- honest words, and dishonest action. Dishonest thinkers are persons who blame other peopl e for their troubles, be- cause they fail to recognize it is their thoughts and emo- tions that lead to their wrong results and trouble. Dishon- est thinkers have difficulty di stinguishing right thoughts from wrong thoughts; consequently they have no easy method for solving problems. Unless they change, they are destined to spend their days in confusion without un- derstanding the cause. The fact that a person beha ves intelligently does not mean that he is intelligent, and the fact that he behaves stu- 125"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"pidly does not mean that he is stupid. The average person often does both. Every normal person, whether he behaves stupidly or not, is intelligent. He has the same mental facul- ties as his contemporaries. I have high regard for what the average person could do, but low regard for what he actually does; it is often far inferior to what he could do. He fails to utilize the benefit of his intelligence, and that is important to society, because it determines how he handles his obligations and responsi- bilities. It is equally important to him, because it deter- mines how he handles his pe rsonal affairs. Beyond those considerations, it also determines the esteem in which he is held by others. Their judgments of his character and ability are based on his actual perf ormance—not on what he could or should do. The remainder of this chapter expresses the concept that caused me to decide years ago that ultimately I would write this book. It is seldom noticed, but di shonesty is a way of seeking something for nothing. Even when successful, getting something for nothing destroys the precious asset of self- reliance. That argument, I fear, may leave the average per- son cold. All his training convinces him that getting some- thing for nothing is attractive, but what comes next should destroy that conviction. While the average person is alert to every chance to get something for nothing, that alertness causes him to be mentally restricted. He becomes victimized by a moral blackout that also distorts his logic. A person caught in that trap cannot achieve his full potential, whereas the person who escapes it becomes outsta nding. That is a real oppor- tunity, and the person who avails himself of that opportu- nity is the one who makes greatest vocational and social 126"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"progress. His activities consis tently put him ahead of the crowd. Therefore, even when a person does not get what he seeks, the person who seeks something for nothing pays a higher price than the person who pays the proper price. In the sense we are using the term, there is no such thing as a person with inferior mentality. Perhaps a person who has wrestled with a dull child is puzzled by that re- mark, but this book deals with the faculty that permits dis- tinction between right and wrong. Everybody has that fac- ulty, and I have found that it is a most vital aid to intelli- gence. By developing and exercising that faculty, a person markedly improves his intelligence. As a student my IQ was 105, whereas twenty years later, my test scores were in the top one percentile of the population. Among average persons, there are no dullards. There are only some who have consigned themselves to dullness by their dishonest thoughts. Th ey use dishonest means to seek advantage in relation to other people and often to blind themselves to their own shortcomings. They think that ad- vantage is genuine, but I shall explain why it is counterfeit. Perhaps you have encounter ed average persons who behave so stupidly that you wonder why. The reason is that they do not use their faculty to distinguish right from wrong. Instead, they habitually favor themselves and their interests in their thinking, a nd that causes them to favor their pocketbooks and their images. “But everybody does that,” a person may say. “It’s normal.” Perhaps so, but it isn’t right and should not be thought normal. The habitually dishonest person bases much of his thinking on false premises, and to that extent, his conclu- sions are wrong. When a conclusion backfires, he may ad- just it into more acceptable form in an effort to preserve his 127"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"distorted illusion that he is righ t. So far as his private think- ing is concerned, that is lik e cheating at solitaire. When welfare of others is involve d, it is more like cheating at bridge. In any case it is dishone st, and because it is dishon- est, it is wrong; and because it is wrong, it gets wrong re- sults. The dishonest person is a menace to everybody except to the person who lives by the principle of absolute right. Most of all, the dishonest pe rson is a menace to himself as his continued dishonest thinki ng keeps his thinking apart from reality. Once I visited a scientific chicken farm and was taken into a building that housed thousands of chicks. Each chick wore a pair of tiny red spectacles. The manager explained, “Every chick will peck at a spot of blood,” he said. “Soon the bloody chick will be dead. Without those glasses, the slightest injury is fatal.” We entered another building illuminated by red lights. “In this light,” he said, “we are hoping to get the same ef- fect at less cost.” The habitually dishonest person is like the chick in red spectacles. He cannot see what ever things his particular brand of dishonesty conceals. He is blind to certain of his mistakes, and also to certain of his opportunities. Since every decision he makes is mi ssing a few vital facts, it is not surprising that his behavi or often looks stupid to some- one else. He is not stupid. He is morally handicapped. And that is true whether his dishonesty is intentional or not. While such persons are like chicks with red glasses, the world we live in is more like the second chicken house. People figuratively live under colored lights that tend to blind them to dishonesty. Ther e are almost universal prac- 128"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"tices of dishonesty that are taught to children, used openly among adults and often pointed to as practical, diplomatic and good business. Small wonde r if most people adopt those dishonest practices. Small wonder if society has prob- lems it cannot solve. Among all the people I have known, few were genu- inely stupid, but there were many whose dishonesty had thrown their minds off the track and afflicted them with mental dullness. Think about some stupid performance of a person you know. Ask, “Isn’t that a ki nd of trouble he could easily have avoided?” What causes trouble for a person is less a lack of intelligence than a lack of honest thought. Those mental blinders are removed simply by applying the principle of absolute right . Then a person discovers that he is not stupefied by the deceptive lights of dishonesty. Over the years I have watched an occasional executive solve a new and perplexing problem without confusion or disaster. I watched as he stre amlined and systematized the procedure so that it became easy to teach. Finally I watched him spend months trying to tr ain another person who only awkwardly carried out the rou tine. Often the trainee was intelligent and educated, but the difference was in the de- gree of his moral blindness more than anything else. From one year to the next, the average person never ut- ters a profound thought unless he is quoting someone. He seldom displays real initiativ e or creative ability, because he does not use good tools of t hought. He has those tools, but their value is canceled by his dishonesty. His ingenuity is consumed in efforts to create false favorable impressions and to hide impressions to his discredit. That is why dis- honest advantage demands more ingenuity than honest suc- 129"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"cess. When the average pers on unshackles his mind of its dishonesty, he makes various illuminating discoveries. It may be true that honesty by itself is not a touchstone of success, but honesty releas es a person’s creative ability and gives it a right direction. Creative abil ity with wrong direction enables him dishonestly to contrive and protect a lie. Whether the lie is thought, st ated or lived, its result is always wrong. The individual who cleanses himself of dishonesty and wrong thinking thereby releases use of higher faculties. The person who fails to cleanse himself, to that extent, works against himself. Wrongdoing results from wr ong thinking. Wrong think- ing leads to wrong words and wrong action. Nonetheless, the average person has an instin ctive desire to be right. He wants to be known as right by others, but, above all, he wants to feel he is right in the recesses of his own con- science. So strong is this natural desire that he cannot do what is wrong without first convincing himself that the wrong is somehow right. He justif ies it often by resorting to extremes of fantasy. The more of that sort of thinking he does, the more he mixes wrong information with right data in his ordinary thought processes. The exception is the person who listens to reason, who admits wrongness the moment it is brought to his attention, who is diligent about finding his mistakes on his own ac- count, and who never advances or defends what is wrong. He is a person worth knowing and one who bears watching. When given an opportunity, he handles it well. When given an obligation, he discharges it conscientiously. He finds satisfactory solutions to problems as they come along. 130"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Part III Rewards Are Beyond Ordinary Belief 12. Temptations to Wrong Thinking 13.

How Fear Really is Conquered 131"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Chapter 12 Temptations to Wrong Thinking Preceding chapters have cited many examples of indi- vidual dishonesty, but there is an unfortunate thing about an example. It has the effect of associating the discussion only with the specific situation described. Even after the point is abundantly proved, people say, “Well, I guess you are right about the dishonesty in that in cident, but what about other incidents?” The fact is that if they were all analyzed, it would be discovered that dishonesties were present in all of them. In discussing the incentives to dishonest, wrong think- ing with its consequent wrong words and wrong action, consider the following: First, there is a kind of dishonesty so prevalent nobody can shrug it off—lying. Within the definitions of Chapter 8, lying is certainly as wrong as stealing, and each is entirely wrong. One kind of lying is as wrong as any other kind, for the same reason. The average parent does not want his children to lie any more than he wants them to steal, but the average parent does both when confronted with enough temptation. If you ever operated a laundry, you would find that lost articles were generally bought la st week and were very ex- pensive. “Nobody ever loses anything old or cheap,” a laundry owner once complained. His remark shows that lying and stealing are often two forms of the same thing, and it refers to a sort of trouble that burdens more people than laundry owners. 132"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Every person who settles disputes, interviews appli- cants for employment, listens to personal appeals or stories told by people seeking opport unities of any so rt knows that it is wise to look behind a speaker’s words for the real truth. Unless the interviewer is well acquainted with the petitioner and has confidence in him, he knows the story virtually always is slanted in the petitioner’s favor. It is cal- culated to credit him or he r with wisdom, knowledge, abil- ity or experience, popularly known as “selling yourself.” The astute listener can detect conversational dishonesty even on trivial subjects just by noticing facial expressions, gestures and physical posture. He can do it without even hearing the spoken words. The fact is that when personal interests are heavily involved, more conversations are dis- honest than honest. Most executives I have known so habitually make al- lowances for conversational di shonesty that, although they do not always know it, they become cynical. The executive who accepts the average stranger’s word on vital matters seldom remains an executive, and the successful executive knows this so well he may pass up promising opportunities just to be safe. The practice of discounting conversation is so general that even the honest person must often prove his points or have them rejected. Seasoned employers instinctively do that sort of discounting, but why confine the practice to them? Most people do it, becau se they have learned that otherwise they may be embarrassed or hurt by accepting misinformation. Conversational dishonesty is so prevalent that it is taken for granted—often not noticed. People become in- ured to conversational dishonest y by exposure to it in thou- sands of conversations, begi nning in childhood. When it is 133"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"noticed, it may be called exa ggeration, which is a polite way of describing deviations from truth. People need a term harsh enough to carry real oppro- brium so that dishonest conve rsation is not overlooked and excused. They should call it wh at it is—lying, and realize that conversational dishonesty is as destructive to intelli- gence as any kind of dishonesty. The basic temptation to dishonesty is the average per- son’s desire to favor himself, his interests and ambitions in everything he thinks, says and does. He wants to present himself to advantage and get the maximum tangible and intangible rewards he can. From infancy, a person is surrounded by people who take dishonest shortcuts in order to satisfy their urges. They do it automatically and unthinkingly from force of habit and example, without ever stopping to consider the damage their dishonesty may cause. The average child copies those dishonest examples because fe w other examples are set be- fore him. Gradually his use of dishonest technique becomes as automatic as it is to his elders. He continues using it unless, somewhere along the line, he gets a shock that causes him to change. There is no reason why he should not advance his inter- ests if they are honest. By advancing them, he benefits both himself and society. He benefits neither himself nor society by basing any portion of his progress on dishonesty. Best results develop if he realistical ly and honestly looks at life and its problems, knowing that unless he do es, vital por- tions of his intelligence are rendered impotent. There is only one way to be realistic: Deal in terms of absolute honesty and absolute right. I didn’t make the rule, I can’t change it and ne ither can anybody else be- cause the rule exists in nature. 134"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Absolute refusal to lie keeps a person out of situations that later may seem to call for a lie. For example, he is less likely to exceed speed limits when driving his car once he has denied himself lying as a way out if he is challenged. Refusal to lie is one of the things that puts people on the path of right and keeps them there. Similarly his refusal to exa ggerate compels him to de- velop his talents and to act responsibly, making exaggera- tion unnecessary. At first, perhaps that makes things more difficult. If he has been operating on partial dishonesty, he loses that op- tion. He is like a reformed counterfeiter who decides to spend only genuine money which means he then has to get a job. At first, the change seems a sacrifice, but one change is pure gain. When he eliminates the dishonest money- making, unless his past catches up to him, he ends all the risk that goes with counterfeit ing. That relief soon compen- sates for any temporary sacrifice. There is another difficulty that results from a switch to absolute honesty. Since people li ve in a dishonest society, most people cannot imagine that another person is genu- inely honest. After people disc ount what they consider to be exaggeration from his honest remarks, there may not be much left. I learned that by experience and, at first, it was discouraging. Later I learned a more important lesson: Honesty automatically develops abilities in the average person that he never knew existed. As his abilities de- velop, they establish him favorably in the minds of others. Here is what the foregoing information means to the average person. If he is scr upulously honest in all his con- versations, he finds himself te nding to satisfy the principle of absolute right in all areas. But it pays to be alert, as 135"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"temptations to dishonesty are frequent and strong, for rea- sons I shall describe. Underlying every dishonest performance is one or more of these typical temptations: The desire to get one’s way, to get something for nothing, to stay out of trouble, or the de- sire for competitive advantage or revenge. Temptation is increased in proportion to these factors: The size of the ad- vantage to be gained, the opportunity to gain it without get- ting caught, and the force of ex ample set by other people’s dishonest practices. Consider a hypothetical case. Suppose a person is given the chance to secure enorm ous dishonest wealth. Suppose the wealth would enable him to prevent or correct serious trouble, free him from heavy responsibilities, enable him definitively to defeat his competitors and enemies. Suppose the opportunity for those ill-gotten gains is thrust upon him so that nobody will ever uncover the dishonesty involved and that it is the sort nearly everybody uses every day. How many people would refuse that temptation? How many would gleefully decide the millennium had arrived? There is something wrong with that picture. The wealth to be gained is dishonest which means that it would cost more than it is worth. Honesty is priceless. Some people would object to that statemen t and consider the foregoing case to involve gain with out loss. Does it? No! For one thing it involves loss of integrity. I am not na- ive enough to believe that the average dishonest person puts a high value on integrity, so the prospect of losing in- tegrity is a weak deterrent. Rather, he must feel threatened by something he wants. The fact is that what a di shonest person sacrifices re- lates to his ability to think rationally. Would a person knowingly buy wealth at the pric e of his sanity? Only if he 136"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"were already partly irrational at the time because of past dishonesties. Something else is wrong with that picture. The person who establishes his life on an honest basis acquires all the opportunities and possessions the dishonest person is tempted to pursue. As for wealth, he has all he needs. As for trouble, he is freed from it and in no danger of getting into more. As for re sponsibilities, he has those he wants, no more and no less. As for competitors, he has none. As for enemies, if he has any, they are persons trying to advance wrong causes. As for opportunities, he has an open road ahead with plenty of incentive to carry him for- ward. As to whether someone might publicize his actions, his life is an open book. As fo r temptation to dishonesty, he knows it points to dange r. His intent always is to think, say and do what is right, and his reward is that whatever he does has a way of succeeding. Safety experts have coined the term “accident prone.” It indicates a person who has a hi story of frequent accidents, so judging by his history, he is the one most likely to have continuing accidents. Experience has demonstrated the term to be sound. The next few paragraphs will develop the theory that the accident-prone person is usually suffering from habitual but perhaps unsuspected dishonest y. To the extent that such is the case, he is also dishonesty prone. That is not to say that every dishonesty-prone pe rson is also accident prone; at least, not if you define an accident in th e sense of physi- cal injury or property damage. But there are other kinds of accidents, and if you in- clude them in your thinking, you will discover that the dis- honesty-prone person is also accident prone in the precise fields of his dishonesty. 137"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"He gets into frequent argum ents, finds it hard to win others’ confidence, often lose s their confidence once it is gained, habitually runs out of money, misses rides and ap- pointments, has poor health, his coworkers gossip about him, he invites long runs of misfortune and blames his troubles on bad luck or other people. A person needs to learn that virtually all trouble is preventable by the in dividual himself. If readers do enough experimenting, they, too, will dis- cover that the accident-prone person is also dishonesty prone and that dishonesty is th e root of the trouble. When a person learns to be honest, he demonstrates the truth of what I have said because his various accidents come to an end. I have seen it happen to others, and it has happened to me. While I cannot describe here the reasons why a person is dishonesty prone, I can descri be some of the types. They will be recognized as typical of people everyone knows. There is the person who is physically and mentally lazy. Lacking proper motivation, he cannot meet his needs unless he supplements his efforts with dishonest tactics. He is the person who copies the original work of others and passes it off as his own, who, literally and figuratively, blows his horn to attract attention, or who seizes every dishonest ad- vantage that comes along. The mentally lazy person, how ever, tends not to be very dangerous. He does not use enough ingenuity to be danger- ous in ways within the law. Therefore, he is less a threat than the person whose dishonesty springs out of excessive ambition and the strong drives that ambition can generate. If his conscience permits, the excessively ambitious person engages in every dishonest practice th at helps to promote his plans. He seeks every means to perpetuate and 138"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"extend his power and resorts to unfairness to win the ad- vantage. He tends to hurt his competitors, because he re- gards them as enemies. He slanders them and assassinates their reputations in an effort to undermine and block their progress. His antisocial behavior is the product of his urges which are measured against his standards of conduct. Where no right standard prev ails, his cons cience is non- functional. Perhaps nobody is more dangerously dishonest than the person who is strictly out for himself. He expresses his selfish urges and tendencies until he is restrained by lack of opportunity, by force or un til he is more compellingly restrained by enlightenment. Next, there is the type of person who is dishonesty prone because he lacks a sense of responsibility. He doesn’t exert his brain to make right de cisions, and he doesn’t exert his body to get things done right and prevent trouble. He doesn’t correct the trouble he causes unless somehow forced. In a discussion he doesn’t check the accuracy of his facts and rattles off nonsensical remarks with an air of au- thority. He is careless of ot her people’s interests and wel- fare and perhaps also of his own. There is the person who feels inferior; therefore, he tries to prove superiority. He uses every occasion to dem- onstrate his imagined qualities without understanding that every real quality expresses itself in his behavior more clearly than it is debated. There is also the person whose mind is closed. He talks decisively about every topic among his special interests, and nobody can give him the correct information he needs because he has judged that he already knows it. 139"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"There is the person who is prejudiced. On those sub- jects, all his opinions reflect false premises that guarantee false conclusions. There is the person who has to dominate every discus- sion. He blatantly varies his arguments to support whatever he is trying to prove. Then there is the smart aleck who uses wisecracks and jokes to smother someone’s sound opposition under laugh- ter, capturing the attention of listeners who fall for his stratagem. It becomes obvious that the dishonesty-prone person is the one who puts selfish desires above the intent to be right in what he th inks, says or does. He may try to gratify his desires often or seldom, but whenever he does, he ex- poses himself to trouble. He becomes vulnerable. To be- come invulnerable, a person needs only to adopt the intent to become right. Unless he has already done irrevocable damage, he can make that cha nge in a flash by deciding to be right. However, he must live up to his decision, for he destroys his invulnerability ever y time he slips back into an old dishonest practice. The sooner a person starts, the better for his body, soul, mind and general welfare. He makes no more sacrifice than the potential burglar who re frains from robbing a house. Anyone who considers that a s acrifice has changes to make in getting his thinking straightened out. So has the person who does not apply the principl e of right action to dishon- esty in every form. The person who universally ap plies that principle dis- covers that his selfish desires begin to merge with what is right. Invariably he discovers that what is right works and satisfies the need of every situation at the same time. That 140"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"is another basic principle known only to the honest person who intends to think, say and do what is right. I think the foregoing demonstrates that masses of peo- ple are dishonest and that thei r dishonesty is the main cause of their troubles and of the world’s troubles, too. There is no possibility of correcting t hose troubles until people cor- rect the dishonesty that causes them. Our next chapter will discuss a pernicious human ten- dency toward mass dishonesty that is almost never ana- lyzed correctly so that support for it continues unabated. 141"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Chapter 13 Exposing Organized Dishonesty At certain times and under certain conditions, various kinds of dishonesty become fashionable. The Prohibition era produced fashionable dishonesties of bootlegging, hi- jacking, gangsterism, speakeasies, bribery of officials, ille- gal distribution and use of al coholic beverages. Wartime shortages produce the fashiona ble dishonesties of black markets, whereas peacetime shortages drive prices sky high on products already in stock and on the shelves. Fashionable dishonesty arises when large numbers of people are simultaneously confronted with the same temp- tation. Those without conscience yield at once and get in on the ground floor. Those who originally demur, notice what is happening, and the less timid join the parade. Presently the person who still refrains begins feeling sorry for him- self because he isn’t getting his share, and he succumbs. By that time the dishonesty has become so general that it would be impossible to jail all the offenders, even if the courts were so inclined. In any case the participants in that sort of dishonesty feel secure because mass dishonesty pre- vails. Sometimes that sort of thing happens in a restricted area as when service men and women bring home loot from for- eign countries and get their pi ctures published, not for their dishonesty but for their accomplishments. Consider the false and misleading statements made to the citizenry during wartime by public officials. Because there is so much misinformati on and because it is not fash- 142"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"ionable to question it, most of their statements go unchal- lenged. But fashionable dishonesty is not confined to war- time nor is it always national in scope. Consider an example of what is repeatedly observed by persons working in an industrial organization. Any number of employees filch small items like paper, pens, stamps, pencils, and often materials and tools that are rather expensive. They know it is wrong, because they take great pains to conceal their thievery. When caught, a person may defend the practice because it is so general that failure to do so seems like forfeiting a right. How far the trouble can go is suggested by the fol- lowing case. A company manufacturing radi os discovered that its in- ventory was short by a quarter million dollars. After inves- tigating, the company posted a notice which read: “Our parts inventory has recently dropped sharply. Investigation shows that company parts are be ing used to build radios at home. Hereafter, lunch boxes wi ll be searched as employ- ees leave. During the next thirty days where we have evi- dence that parts were stolen, homes will be searched.” The notice added significantly, “No employees’ lunch boxes will be searched on entering the plant.” Shortly a new inventory check disclosed that most of the missing parts had been returned to stock. Next, I shall describe a somewhat complicated illustra- tion that every industrial engi neer will recognize as a com- mon occurrence when opportunity arises. Consider a company where production is handled on a piecework basis. Time-study men are employed to set the workers’ rates. Often a worker intentionally delays a job while it is being measured. But those time-study men are experienced and allow for an amount of intentional delay. 143"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Being human, however, they make mistakes. Consider a mistake that is typical. A job is measured to include certain operations. One of the workers discovers a shortc ut. Using that shortcut, he could turn out twice as many pieces, but he doesn’t do that. Instead, he takes it easy. He turns out only half the number of extra pieces and makes extra money. Time-study men learn that he is “running away with the rate.” They watch him, but he conceals his actions. Unless they discover the shortcut and embody it in the manufactur- ing procedure, the union contract stipulates that the com- pany may not alter the rate. The worker knows this, and that is why he keeps hi s shortcut to himself. A fellow worker discovers the slick operator’s secret and does the same thing. More and more operators get in on what they consider a good thi ng, and they conspire to pro- tect their secret. Some persons may think such things are common with laboring men, but I have spent much time with laboring men and have found them basically no different from other workers. The same sort of th ing is often done where profes- sionalism is usually assumed. Consider the profession of teaching. . To provide incentive for its teachers, a board of educa- tion established a new classification labeled “superior” teacher. The board set up the qualifications and announced that any teacher meeting them would receive a substantial pay increase. Those who could easily do so qualified at once. The others grumbled. When any sort of extracurri cular work was to be passed out, ordinary teachers got in to the habit of saying, “Give that job to a superior t eacher. I’m not good enough.” 144"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Many were less outspoken, but the superior teachers were soon earning their extr a pay by doing all the extra work. The result? The board wa s forced to classify all teachers as superior regard less of their qualifications. Those teachers changed the functioning of their eco- nomic unit, which is not unusual. Once a change becomes fixed, it is difficult or impossi ble to restore the original condition so that what starts as an abused privilege be- comes a vested right. Suppose a company announced that employees would be paid for periods of illness to taling thirty days a year. As many companies have discovere d, that can lead to unex- pected consequences. Soon employees exert pressure to change the policy. Some arguments have enough logic that occasional excep- tions are made. Each exception becomes a precedent. Be- fore long, the company is forced to give everybody thirty free days each year in add ition to his annual holidays and paid vacation. In addition, vi rtually every employee takes that time off whether he is sick or not. The final result is that if an employee gets sick, he does it on his own time, because he has gained a vested interest in his extra time. From the vi ewpoint of this book, it is a dishonest system—which does not relate in any way to the merits or demerits of sick leave. In describing those manifest ations of fashionable dis- honesty, I also described something that is known as the gravy train. The mechanism is that one person sees another gain un- fair advantage. He feels cheated, so, in seeking to right the wrong by imitating the dishonest procedure or finding a substitute, he takes the wrong st ep. Others see what is go- ing on and join in. Soon a gra vy train has formed. But note: 145"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"No person gets on a gravy train unless he personally chooses to be dishonest. The defense for such action is weak: Others are doing it, and everybody is entitled to his share. Unfortunately, that weak defense often looks strong, because penalties cannot be applied on a mass basis. Life provides the penal- ties, but society cannot directly protect itself against mass dishonesty until each person lear ns to protect himself from himself. That takes a return to morality and to the properly functioning conscience. Not being a candidate for public office, I intend to state what people often are afraid to say for publication. Getting something for nothing, even when legal and fashionable, is dishonest. Ge tting too much for too little, even when the opportunity exists , is also dishonest. It is dishonest to seek that sort of gain and dishonest to accept it if successfully sought by others on your behalf. Having ac- cepted it, it is dishonest to keep it. It is evident that no gravy train is established out of love for its passengers. The purpose of the political gravy train is not to distribute gra vy. It is to collect votes. Let me repeat that the average person wants to do things right. He is convinced that he is right. Where he is shown that what he is doing is wrong, he changes. Few are willing to be wrong on purpose, especially when they are aware of what it costs them and others. There is only one way to change a person from wrong to right: Bring his thinking into conformity with what is right. When someone sees he is di shonest, that his dishon- esty is visible to others, and that his dishonesty is costing him more than he is gettin g out of it, he changes. Getting enough such people to change would wreck the various gravy trains. 146"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Much trouble springs out of the fact that political lead- ers feel compelled to serve tw o masters: the party and the public. A national administration, in its desire to provide for the general good, must also keep a constant eye on the supporters who voted the part y into power. To be more specific, the President is seldom free to have a differing opinion about matters of prime interest to the block of vot- ers who got him elected and presumably can keep him there. On those matters, his thinking is likely to be adjusted to theirs. That kind of mental pressure is destructive to in- telligence, no matter whose intelligence is involved. To a considerable extent, society is expected to live by dishonest techniques. Over the generations, those dishonest techniques have been refined and taught. Masses of people have discovered that they ge t results so do not question their honesty. It may be true that people were as dishonest in earlier generations, but only this generation has had enough inge- nuity to develop such an or ganized network of dishonest techniques that our dishonesty is finally at a point of en- gulfing us. People should be reminded th at there are plenty of hon- est techniques. Those honest techniques achieve more than dishonest techniques can achieve. A small proportion of people using honest techniques can defeat a large propor- tion who do not. There are people w ho already know this and are putting their knowledge to good use. What we need is millions more. When we have them, no political party would dare advance a program of pandering to individual or mass dishonesty for petty reward. No honest person would be willing to sacrifice his integrity when he under- stands how a dishonest mess of pottage keeps him from his natural birthright. 147"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Chapter 14 How Fear Really Is Conquered Society is groping for someth ing to help people out of their present crises. There is increasing recognition in nu- merous newspaper and magazine articles that we need men- tal, emotional and spiritual rebirth. Virtually any intelligent private or televised discussion of national or international affairs refers to the need for moral choices. You hear it from Republicans and Demo crats, people in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, and the Middle East, from lead- ers in high positions and low. It is slowly but surely pene- trating the public ’s consciousness. This book is issued to help that movement along. In the foregoing pages, I made a number of strong as- sertions. For example, I asserted that complete honesty makes the individual invulnerable, causes his life to open before him, confronts him with unending opportunities and constructive plans, and rightfully crowns his efforts with success. I said, virtually all of life’s problems are solved by simple and obvious choices between right and wrong. When those choices are honestly made by a major- ity of people, most troubles will cease. One troublesome situation after another could finally be resolved by resort to the principle of absolute right: Think, say and do what is right; refuse to think, say and do what is wrong. This nation affords an excelle nt social climate in which broadscale honesty can thrive . Americans are favored with freedom that, more than anything else, prov ides the oppor- 148"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"tunity to choose right instead of wrong. We have opportuni- ties in abundance that should be intelligently shared. Americans are confronted with economic and career opportunities that have never existed. They have every incentive to make the most of those opportunities, and the way to do it is honestly to think, say and do what is right. It is often argued that society needs more and better laws. Personally, I do not agree, and I disagree with the popular assumption that we ca nnot legislate morality. On the other hand, I’d rather not live in a society where nobody can make a decision without consulting a lawyer nor among people who need such laws. I want to live among people who are trying to do what is right and who are not penalized if they make a well-intentioned mistake. Their wrong result would guide their minds back to the right track. In the final analysis, honest y is an individual matter. Each person must individuall y decide to make his own choices between right and wrong. However, the results of dis honesty are more than indi- vidual in scope. When masses of people make wrong deci- sions, especially when wrong decisions are made by public officials, the effect is deva stating indeed. When group dis- honesty shapes national thinki ng, it causes national and in- ternational conflict and injusti ce. Even when we do not re- alize it, group dishonesty ha s a way of injuring people where it hurts the most. When people realize that group dishonesty causes national and international troubles, those troubles can be corrected. There is only one way to do that—correct individual di shonesty. The most influential individuals to reach are those in positions of strategic lead- ership, but everybody is important. 149"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Each individual doing what he knows is right and re- fusing to do what he knows is wrong ensures a secure fu- ture. Let him do it in his vocational, public and private life. That is the way to solve our local, national and interna- tional problems. At the time of this writing, it has never been tried on a broad scale. Because the absolutely right way of life has been al- most entirely rejected, society lives in fear. In modern times, no generation has been so anxious, so frightened, so confused. People are afraid of war, economic recession, ecological disruption, fuel shortages, racial injus- tices and so on. Most of th eir fears are misdirected. A twelve-year-old boy said to his mother, “You know, Mom, I wish I were forty years old.” “Whatever gave you that idea?” “Because I heard that everybody will be killed when the bombs go off. If I were over forty, I’d have had my life, and I wouldn’t care!” Do you fear nuclear destructio n? I don’t. The reason is partly that I cannot control use of the bombs. Since fear is nature’s prod for stimulati ng constructive action, that makes fearing it nonproductive, bu t there is a deeper rea- son. Nuclear weapons are dangerous only if handled irre- sponsibly; they are dangerous if exploded in our midst—by an enemy or accidentally by us . Natural fear would be di- rected at the enemy or the military rather than the bomb, and that is a fear we can do something about. Fear of nuclear weaponry is really fear of the political and military leaders having it. It is fear of how those lead- ers may deal with one another. Despite any futility a person may feel, that is something he can influence. 150"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"It is done by making certain that every decision he makes is an honest decision to take and s upport right ac- tion. I once heard an ex-congressman address a large gather- ing of industrial executives. He discussed the shortcomings of our government and said our government is riddled with dishonesty and corruption. No pe rson in the audience tried to deny it. Our government, according to that ex-congressman, is spending its way into bankruptcy, reelecting itself by prom- ising unearned handouts, crippl ing industry by taxation, socializing us beyond our means, sapping the self-reliance of individual citizens by tr aining them to depend on gov- ernment, and otherwise progressively undermining the American system of free enterprise. There is no need to identif y that ex-congressman. I had heard the same speech thirty times before, idea for idea, though not word for word. Every such talk elicited thun- derous applause; never did any listener raise a word of dis- sent. Do you fear those conditions that ex-congressman de- scribed? I don’t, and the r eason is that I cannot control those conditions. Again, th at makes fearing them nonpro- ductive. But insofar as the assertions are justified, I fear the persons who caused them. And th at is also a fear people can do something about. Each person does his part by basing every decision on an honest decision to live by th e principle of absolute right. Many important problems beset society. It is common knowledge that there is corrupti on in our national, state and local governments. Every dis honest decision a person makes gives his tacit support to rackets, graft and dishonest leadership. What is needed is a majority of persons who 151"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"habitually distinguish between right and wrong and use their consciences to move in the direction of right. Those people will improve their lives at once, and when there are enough of them, society will be led into unimagined na- tional and international peace and prosperity. Once I rode downtown with an other driver. I was in no hurry, but the driver was. Sudde nly he saw a chance to save two seconds by squeezing between two fast-moving cars. “That was tight,” I said. “Was it?” “Didn’t you see it?” I asked. “No,” said the driver. “When I see a tight squeeze com- ing, I close my eyes.” Needless to say, that was my last ride with that driver. Whether we like it nor not, we are being taken for the same sort of ride every day of our lives by irresponsible and dishonest local, state and national leaders who were not trained to develop personal in tegrity of the sort demanded by life. There is no use ignoring th e situation, we face many crises. Our leaders are constantly squeezing through tight places, taking corners on two wheels, blindly screeching through dilemmas, and encountering potential disaster. They are doing the driving, and we are passengers who can’t get out. Consider another figure of speech. Society is sitting on a pile of nuclear bombs while sinis- ter strangers finger the tri gger mechanism. People are struggling toward financial s ecurity while inflationary forces and “deficit drain” suck the wealth out of their in- comes and savings. People are trying to succeed under the free enterprise system while fuzzy-minded radicals use acts of terror and threats of war to meddle with that form of 152"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"government. People are trying to vote intelligently while dishonest politicians sacrifice the public’s future welfare to favor their own political ambitions. There is no sense pretending that such things are not happening. To ignore them is to emulate the proverbial os- trich and hide our heads in th e sand. There also is no sense in thinking nothing can be done about it either. Something can be done. What, precisely, is being done? Our leaders are making emphatic statements and accu- sations to those people who al ready agree with them. That is as much as most leaders are doing. Most other people, as a matter of fact, are doing much less. They are taking men- tal sedatives: watching television, following the sports news, going to vacation spots, conducting business as usual, fiddling while Rome burns. To quiet their fears, other people turn to literary sedatives: learning to cultivate happiness, overcome fear, be number one and acquire ex- cellence along with peace of mind. By reading books that tell readers how to be happy de- spite society’s troubles, the public is trying to relieve a na- tional anxiety complex. Those books are not relieving the anxiety. Society needs something more in the nature of a purgative; it needs a turn to honesty. The trend toward mental sedatives is understandable. In the face of local, national and world conditions that are so tense and potentially volatile, it seems a relief to be di- verted by fantasies and comic offerings of the entertain- ment world. People can read “how to” books, apply them and go on suffering—unless they face up to one basic fact. The fact is that peace, constructive action and prosperity develop as the result of thinking, saying and doing what is right. 153"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"There is an unfortunate eff ect about the peace-of-mind approach to life. It is not dynamic. It palliates instead of energizing. This is an age for progress if ever there was one. Besides, people do not r eally want mental and emo- tional ease. People are built fo r action. They crave excite- ment. Watch them on the highway, at the race track, cheer- ing sports events, doing action things that are intended to stimulate the good life. While the average person may think he wants mental and physical rest, what happens when he gets it? He is bored. He looks for something to do. He wants action. Most of all, he enjoys the thrill of achievement. Akin to the desire for peace of mind is the average per- son’s passionate desire for ha ppiness. That, too, is overes- timated. The thoughtful person understands that happiness loses significance when it is bought by appeasement of an unprincipled person or any other compromise. The average person may cringe because he generates emotional tensions of fear and unhappiness. But all ten- sions are not negative. Ther e are constructive tensions. A constructive tension is an em otional force to be used for constructive action. It can be considered an unsatisfied drive toward a right result. If people seek artificial means of relieving those tensions, they lose their stimulus and value. By learning the knack, negative tensi ons can be re- lieved by simply giving effectiv e expression to constructive action. Tensions could be compared to a tightly wound clock spring that releases its stored-up energy in useful work. In the final analysis it will be discovered that con- structive tensions result from honesty and negative ten- sions result from dishonesty. There is an easy way to build constructive tensions, and th e same expedient converts 154"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"negative tensions: Conform with the principle of absolute right. Think, say and do what is right; refuse to think, say and do what is wrong. The person who applies that principle of behavior finds that his tensions dr ive him to choose ri ght instead of wrong. He achieves invulnerability a nd an exciting, new way of life. Such a person conquers every fear. For purposes of this book, fear can be divided into two general categories. First is fear that arises from the individ- ual’s own sense of personal inadequacy as when he feels unequal to his problems. Second is fear that springs out of social conditions that loom threateningly as when the cards of life seem to be stacked against him. There is a single procedur e for overcoming both those fears. It happens when the individual exerts himself to do what is right. The more resist ance he encounters in himself, the greater the opportunity to develop physical, emotional and mental power. The very c onditions that engender fear provide a challenge. It is intelligent to meet that challenge rather than to accept defeat. Start taking right action and fear diminishes. Keep moving in the right direction and fear dissolves. The person whose life is based on taking steps to satisfy right objectives experiences pe riodic peaks of great happi- ness. That happiness provides enough satisfaction to keep him safely exhilarated, alt hough there is also enough natu- ral dissatisfaction to keep him surging ahead. With every forward step, he adds to his capacity for happiness. He overcomes fear. He learns that fear springs only from failure to deal with the situations of life. He learns that the person who accepts the demands of life without rebelling is too busy to be afraid. He also learns 155"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"that running from those demands generates fears he cannot vanquish. The way to conquer fear is to deal with every situation in complete honesty. Each constructive step reduces bore- dom and generates enthusiasm for the next. The person who takes an unending series of constructive steps has in- tervals of rest and diversi on that give him happiness and deep satisfaction. Those intervals only recur as he contin- ues inviting them by thinki ng, saying and doing what is right. I have been discussing the essential objective of honest, right action. No matter how di scouraged a person feels, he can boost his spirits by helping that cause along. Each time he adds an impulse to the cause for right action, he gets the thrill of a good job well done. Perhaps a reader might still be inclined to question, “What can I do?” I suggest that he or she recognize the challenge of to- day’s world and meet life head on. Square himself with his conscience. Do what he can to improve conditions. See that every personal decision is co mpletely honest. If a person does that, he can face the future unafraid. He does it by waging an intentional campaign of aggressive honesty. No- body can do it by following the commonplace custom of pretending that problems don’t exist or that there is nothing to be done about them. I have stated again and again that a life lived in accord with the principle of absolute right will be a life of satis- faction and achievement. That is true. The person who lives such a life benefits every body on earth. He will bene- fit posterity. Before he benefi ts anyone else, he benefits himself, because he has a dy namic formula for successful accomplishment. It is a fortunate fact that the formula is 156"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"not open to abuse. He cannot cause trouble for other people nor for himself by using it. Neglecting to use the formula is what causes trouble for them and for him. Virtually every religion teaches that present in our uni- verse there are two basic oppos ing forces. They are the forces of good and evil. Those forces are symbolically ex- pressive of God and Satan. It is the good force that causes people to follow the right path, and it is the evil force that causes them to follow the wrong path. Whether a person accepts the religious explanation or not, it should be clear that every right choice releases a force for good, whereas every wrong choice releases a force for evil. The choice of wrong thoughts, words and action results in trouble, but the consistent choice of right thoughts, words and action result s in unlimited benefits for the person, his countrymen a nd the people of the world. It is worth something to recognize that what is wrong in life is based on emotiona l unreality and is temporary. What is right in life is part of the reality that unfailingly endures, establishing the principle that right is might. 157"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Appendix Summation of Fundamental Concepts Chapter 1: Right Will Eventually Prevail Among all the lessons taught by history, the most im- portant is that the forces of right ultimately triumph in every long-continued struggl e.

Thus this book will pinpoint the exact nature of a de- lusion that has captured the minds of billions of peo- ple, some who think there is nothing amiss and others who know that something is amiss but do not know what causes their fear and frustration. There are no bad people. There are only people who make bad mistakes. Persuasion must offer attraction toward personal ad- vantage and gain or toward the opportunity to avoid trouble and loss.

The principle of absolute right is based on a natural law of behavior that I di scovered while working out my own moral code. Natural distinctions of right and wrong are self- enforcing: attempted violations of gravity bring bumps, bruises and broken bo nes. A child needs to learn that dishonesty natura lly brings impairment to his intellect. The child who learns to be honest deals with his early frustrations by extracting their value. The basis of intellectual dishonesty is the lie. The child who suffers frust ration may blight his de- velopment, which I question, but the child who lies impairs his intellect.

The process of developing dish onesty consists of just two things: ability to fool other people and ability to fool oneself. Existence of a pressure gr oup is almost prima facie evidence of one purpose: to substitute personal force for logic. The pressure is in the impersonal facts of the situa- tion; those facts speak for themselves.

To the precise extent a person seems to succeed by dishonesty, he rend ers his life unsafe. People need to learn that only honest right action can bring invulnerability. Then they discover that duty and desire are truly identical, that pursuit of duty brings desired happi ness and well-being, and that real freedom comes from thinking, saying and doing what is right. Organized dishonesty is de veloped and perpetuated by a network of reciprocal favors, by graft and cor- ruption of officials, but above all, by the support and connivance of dishonest people. Every person has one true standard, and that standard is absolute right. Pressure is once removed fro m violence, and both are poor substitutes for honesty. 164"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"Chapter 9: The Importance of Being Right Right is what works without detriment of any sort, it encourages other people to get on the side of right, and it serves the best inte rests of everybody properly involved. The right thing to do is al ways the best, safest, and most expedient thing to do. Because people trying to be right reason from the same reference points, conf lict is not possible until wrong is somehow introduced. An accidental or imagined wrong can cause as much damage as an intentiona l wrong, because any wrong is wrong. The person willing to turn the other cheek does not receive the first blow. Do not oppose a person; inst ead, oppose only what is wrong. Dislike what he says, if you must, but do not dislike him. Recognize that it is not necessary to fight for right—only to state it. No person can long withsta nd the continued onslaught of carefully presented truth. It will finally compel rec- ognition of error. It will finally reconcile the causes of misunderstanding and correct what is wrong. If an opponent can be defeat ed, there is no need to fight. If he cannot be def eated, fighting is foolish. 165"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":" Here, then, is the formula to prevent conflict: Don’t give offense; don’t invite offense; don’t take offense. Fighting is no way to settle a moral issue. In fact, it is an invitation to the less sc rupulous antago nist to do his worst. A dispute starts when a pe rson, perhaps more than one, is wrong. It is corrected only when those who are wrong become right. The truth is a dispute shoul d not be won or lost; it should be resolved. That is accomplished by the direct application of honesty. Ask disputants: Are you trying to do the right thing? Will you accept the right answer when it emerges? When the right answer is found, it will suit everybody involved. The person who makes a mistake needs help more than he needs to be hurt. A right decision is not re ached by appe asement, by horse-trading, by compromise or by concessions. It is reached by exposing the fa cts and letting them con- trol. Right can always be defend ed, can hardly be criti- cized, can seldom be ove rruled. But wrong makes you vulnerable, undermines the strength of your position, invites others to knock you down, and provides the very tools for doing it. 166"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":" Right is an exact quality, and on every basic issue, there is an identity between what benefits the individ- ual and what benefits humanity as a whole. To do what is right, therefor e, is the natural formula for having a spectacular ca reer and fulfilling exis- tence. Chapter 10: How To Make an Honest Decision Right action gets right results; wrong action gets wrong results. The average person does not know that freedom of choice consists of the ability conscientiously to think, say and do what is right. Every question has many possible wrong answers and only one answer that is right. Right decisions are found, not made. Every right answer is dete rmined by a right question, and every right question is determined by correct in- terpretation of a problem. The person who chooses to be right is free, and any other so-called freedom actua lly is a form of unsus- pected slavery. 167"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"Perhaps consciousness serves its highest function in relation to decisions, and arriving at a right decision is perhaps the best example of a free will at work. Consciousness epitomizes people’s ability to discern choices in the practical situa tions of life. In a very real sense, consciousness is the stuff of life. Consciousness is evidence of free will and evidence of opportunity to make free choices. Therefore, it is evidence of the ability to choose between right and wrong. Freedom is the opportunity to choose what is right. If life is a series of choices in accordance with the principle of absolute right, then each person has a per- fect path of life stretching out before him. Given the opportunity, his life plans itself. Nature is a better planner than a person. Decisions are predetermi ned by relevant facts. Determine that the decision is based on an honest im- pulse in touch with reality. Wrong decisions are based on false premises or on dishonest personal motives. Honest decisions made in conformity with the princi- ples of right behavior will necessarily be right. 168"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"A difficult problem is difficult only when a person is not able to manage it readil y. If he keeps trying to un- derstand the problem, it will become easy. The way to be right is to collect and interpret the ap- propriate facts. Every problem should be reduced to the simplest de- gree of understandability. A genius is a person who knows how to be right. That makes all his decisions sound. A person does not have to be perfect to get the effect of perfection. The person who gets into frequent trouble is someone who is not trying to do what is right. Chapter 11: The Great Cost of Being Wrong Dishonesty benefits nobody. At best, it is a trick for obtaining something of seemi ng value in exchange for what is priceless. Invariably the wrongdoer is one of his victims. No matter how successful he appears to be, the wrong thinker is a slave to his wrongness. The way to avoid wrong decisions is to adopt the in- tent to be right, and the way to do that is to be honest. 169"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"The fully honest person is emotionally secure. His intent to think, say and do what is right makes him invulnerable to other people’s trouble, and he doesn’t cause trouble for himself. Dishonest thinkers have di fficulty distinguishing right thoughts from wrong thoughts; consequently they have no easy method for solving problems. Unless they change, they are destined to spend their days in confusion without understanding the cause. While the average person is alert to every chance to get something for nothing, that alertness causes him to be mentally restricted. The habitually dishonest pe rson bases much of his thinking on false premises, and to that extent, his con- clusions are wrong. Most of all, the dishonest person is a menace to him- self as his continued dishonest thinking keeps his thinking apart from reality. What causes trouble for a pers on is less a lack of in- telligence than a lack of honest thought. It may be true that honesty by itself is not a touch- stone of success, but honest y releases a person’s crea- tive ability and gives it a right direction.

The person who fail s to cleanse himself, to that extent, works against himself. Chapter 12: Temptations to Wrong Thinking Conversational dishonesty is so prevalent that it is taken for granted—often not noticed. The basic temptation to dishonesty is the average per- son’s desire to favor himself, his intere sts and ambi- tions in everything he thinks, says and does. There is only one way to be realistic: deal in terms of absolute honesty and absolu te right. I didn’t make the rule, I can’t change it and neither can anybody else because the rule ex ists in nature. Honesty automatically devel ops abilities in the aver- age person that he never knew existed. Honesty is priceless. A person needs to learn that virtually all trouble is preventable by the individual himself. Perhaps nobody is more dangerously dishonest than the person who is strictly out for himself. He ex- presses his selfish urges and tendencies until he is re- strained by lack of opportunity, by force or until he is more compellingly restrained by enlightenment. 171"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"It becomes obvious that th e dishonesty-prone person is the one who puts selfish de sires above the intent to be right in what he thinks, says or does. Invariably he disc overs that what is right works and satisfies the need of ever y situation at the same time. Chapter 13: Exposing Organized Dishonesty It is evident that no gravy train is established out of love for its passengers. The purpose of the political gravy train is not to distribut e gravy. It is to collect votes. When someone sees he is di shonest, that his dishon- esty is visible to others, and that his dishonesty is costing him more than he is getting out of it, he changes. A small proportion of people using honest techniques can defeat a large proportion who do not. No honest person would be willing to sacrifice his in- tegrity when he understand s how a dishonest mess of pottage keeps him from his natural birthright. Chapter 14: How Fear Really Is Conquered Complete honesty makes the individual invulnerable, causes his life to open before him, confronts him with unending opportunities and co nstructive plans, and rightfully crowns his efforts with success. 172"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Think, say and do what is ri ght; refuse to think, say and do what is wrong. Americans are confronted with economic and career opportunities that have ne ver existed. They have every incentive to make the most of those opportuni- ties, and the way to do it is honestly to think, say and do what is right. When people realize that group dishonesty causes na- tional and international troubl es, those troubles can be corrected. Each individual doing what he knows is right and re- fusing to do what he knows is wrong ensures a secure future. What is needed is a majority of persons who habitu- ally distinguish between right and wrong and use their consciences to move in the direction of right. The fact is that peace, constructive action and pros- perity develop as the resu lt of thinking, saying and doing what is right. A constructive tension is an emotional force to be used for constructive action. It can be considered an unsatisfied drive toward a right result. In the final analysis it will be discovered that con- structive tensions resu lt from honesty and negative tensions result from dishonesty. 173"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":" 174 Think, say and do what is ri ght; refuse to think, say and do what is wrong. Start taking right action and fear diminishes. Keep moving in the right direction and fear dissolves. The way to conquer fear is to deal with every situa- tion in complete honesty. A life lived in accord with the principle of absolute right will be a life of satisfaction and achievement. The person who lives such a life benefits everybody on earth. He will benefit posterity. Before he benefits anyone else, he bene fits himself, because he has a dy- namic formula for successful accomplishment. It is worth something to re cognize that what is wrong in life is based on emotional unreality and is tempo- rary. What is right in life is part of the reality that un- failingly endures, es tablishing the principle that right is might."}]
