You will discover how duty and desire become one, why pursuit of duty brings happiness and that real freedom comes from pursuing the Right-Action Ethic. You will learn what Richard W. Wetherill discovered as teacher, lecturer, author and management consultant to leaders of business and industr y for more than six decades. During that period, he wrote best-selling management ma- terial, including the first book on industrial foremanship, Management Techniques for Foremen , published by Na- tional Foremen’s Institute, Inc. Other titles, published by D. Van Nostrand Co., include: How to Succeed with People, How to Put Your Ideas Across and How to Get Leadership and Influence. Wetherill made the study of human behavior his life’s work, culminating in his trai nees’ giving birt h to a highly successful business, based on those principles. Wetherill Associates, Inc. (WAI) of Royersford, Pennsylvania has grown from $1 million in sale s in 1980 to about $80 mil- lion in 1992, by applying princi ples of right action. The re- sult has brought deep personal satisfaction, job security and prosperity to hundreds of me n and women whose lives he touched. They want to share the formula with everybody. The fundamental premise of We therill’s formula is that there is an objective moral Re ality (capitalized to distin- guish our use of the word from the more limited definition). This Reality, in Wetherill’s thinking, resides in an all- powerful, natural law and is carefully differentiated from subjective, personal reality. Much like the force of gravity, the law of absolute right simply IS—invisible and imper- iv"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"sonal, perhaps, but exerting mighty influence on our lives, whether we recognize it or not: Right action gets right re- sults, whereas wrong action gets wrong results. The good news is that Reality, as Wetherill defines it, is full of human possibility—possibility for change, for growth, for making reliable deci sions, for creating a better world—so long, Wetherill says, as we recognize its abso- lute power in our lives. Those people who have rec ognized the power of this objective, moral Reality (as opposed to their own self- centered, subjective reality) have been able to create lives and careers based on taking “right action.” As a natural consequence, they are getting “right results.” As you read this book, you will embark on a voyage of self-discovery that may shoc k you, but it will also present a vision for you, for America and for the whole world com- munity. In the process, you will be helping to put America on the right track! v"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Introduction Many popular writers warn that something in America has died. Perhaps so. But the leadership spirit of America will impact the whole wide world when business managers apply the leadership principles stated and illustrated on the pages of this book. While it is true that America is at peace, the Cold War is over and the USSR is defunct, it is equally evident that, individually and collectivel y, choices are being compro- mised, prejudices preserved an d financial hardships con- tinue unrelieved. The good news is that there is a shaft of light piercing the gloom—a light that will l ead Americans into a new day of world leadership. This book is about that shaf t of light. It is about performance, and wh en you read this book you will find it full of solutions based on principles as old as time itself but as new as the moment you live in. Readers will learn that what underlies family values and ethical be- havior as well as financial success are basic principles guaranteed to work in every situation. This book is not about a famous person or celebrity. You will not find famous quotes from well-known per- sons—past or present. It is a book about the experiences of ordinary people who are applying principles for successful living and, as a result, are en joying huge success in their careers, with business associat es, family members and one another. These principles were learned from Richard W. Wetherill, a man whose vision helped shape the lives of these ordinary people, and whos e insights have shed a great light on the corporate pathway. It was his contact with real- vi"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"ity that gave Wether ill the wisdom, couns el and ethical val- ues that shaped his own life and the lives of his students. Everybody can apply these princi ples to achieve an as- tonishing intellectual breakthr ough. The principles of the Right-Action Ethic are the keyst one of what is today a mul- timillion-dollar corporate success story: Wetherill Associ- ates, Inc. (WAI) of Royersford, Pennsylvania. This book shows you how taking right action creates personal joy, emotional health and professional success, and how ethical behavior by in dividuals raises the quality of life for businesses, families, communities, America and the world. I am personally indebted to my friend and mentor Rich- ard W. Wetherill for his insp iration, kindness, foresight and the principles he taught me. I want to pass along his in- sights into successful living to my own and the next genera- tion, who will use these insights to provide leadership for a nation that is crying out for relief from its gripping prob- lems. At WAI, our management is strengthened by Mr. Wetherill’s observation: “No pe rson can long withstand the continued onslaught of carefully presented truth.

(W AI) in Royersford, Pennsyl- vania, you are surrounded by a sense of calm and tranquil- ity. Missing is the air of frantic hustle and bustle, of tension and indifference. There is a curious air of innocence and unhurriedness as one is greete d by two young-at-heart la- dies, seated at high-tech cons oles with headsets—one in her late seventies, the other in her eighties—handling with complete calm a constant stream of calls. Their faces and body language show they are re laxed and happy in their work. Their smiles are real and their greetings to strangers are genuine and warm. You know they care about you and they care about the company they work for. This is not the corporate America found on Market Street or Madison Avenue or the Chicago Loop. It is a kind of corporate America built on and directed by principles that most Americans know about, somewhere in their hearts and minds, yet fail to apply. Wetherill Associates, Inc. (WAI), is a quintessential success story based on a drama tic growth pattern with a profitable bottom line in a time of financial recession. It demonstrates how the intent to do what each situation calls for—just because it is right—gets a successful result. It also allows employees from 18 to 90 to be a part of that success and enjoy its financial stability. WAI is a modern-day cor- porate success story, with a unique approach to leadership. 2"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"How It All Began Wetherill Associates, Inc., began in 1978 when a woman from suburban Philadelphia, E. Marie Bothe, and others in Richard Wetheri ll’s Behavioral Study Group, pooled their resources and se t up shop as manufacturers’ representatives for several major companies. In one bold move, WAI entered the rough- and-tumble world of the American automobile aftermarket industry where shady deals were often the norm. But these people were prepared. For a number of years, the original 34 employees had li stened to and absorbed the Right-Action Ethic of Richard W. Wetherill, their mentor and friend. In fact, for 20 year s Bothe had been his right- hand assistant in bringing t ogether members of his Behav- ioral Study Group. Now they were ready to put theory into practice in a business situation. Wetherill, a longtime mana gement consultant, first formed this Behavioral Study Group in 1950 to counter what he had seen as the disa strous consequences of wrong thinking, leading to wrong act ion and wrong results in the business world and in people’s personal lives. Over the next quarter of a century, he wo rked with his associates and taught them to reason from reality rather than from their likes and dislikes when making decisions—a kind of scien- tific method applied to behavior. On July 21, 1978 Wether- ill Associates, Inc., was incorporated at King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, 20 miles northwest of Philadelphia. The per- sonnel was composed of senior citizens and middle-aged adults, but mostly of young people, barely out of their teens. The fruits of Wetherill’s labors were finally being real- ized. The seeds he had planted had germinated and had 3"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"sprung into life as Wetherill A ssociates, Inc., a name that was chosen to honor Mr. Weth erill and provide incentive for all employees to perform at the highest level. Reflecting on those early year s, Bothe, president of WAI, admits that the compa ny “fell” into the automotive aftermarket business because one member of the Study Group had had some experience in that field. In addition, research associates in other locations needed an employ- ment opportunity so they could join Mr. Wetherill in the Philadelphia area. The irony of their choice of business should not be lost. The automotive remanufacturi ng industry grew out of the junkyard business after Worl d War II and was not known for its high ethical standards. Yet undaunted, the personnel had confidence in Wetherill’s teachings and practiced the Right-Action Ethic against al l odds. They enforced a no- gifts-accepted policy, refused to give kickbacks and, with the intent to do th e right thing, dealt with customers hon- estly. From their modest offices, the young sales staff began selling automotive parts by te lephone. With virtually no telemarketing experience or tr aining in modern sales tech- niques, they soon found themselves caught in a dilemma. Many of the companies WAI represented did not properly support their sales efforts. For example, WAI would pro- vide customers quotes on parts, prices and delivery times, but the manufacturers they represented would not follow through as promised, and some companies were not sup- portive in other ways. More serious, several times WAI was forced to resort to the courts to be paid their commis- sions. “To solve the problem, we be gan to stock our own parts and became distributors as well as representatives,” Bothe 4"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"recalls. As a result of that decision, the company began to grow and moved to larger quarters in King of Prussia—a converted warehouse that had once been a Lubin movie-set location where Toonerville Trolley and Marie Dressler comedies had been filmed in the 1920’s. Bothe describes this kind of business expansion as “management by reality.” “As the reality called for expan- sion in warehouse space and number of employees to fill the needs of our customers, we expanded. It wasn’t a goal we had set. Reality pushed us into it. That’s why in 1986, we had to move to much larg er quarters and developed a major warehousing operation in Royersford.” With its in-depth market re search and technical training program, WAI connected custom ers and suppliers with at- tractive price structures by means of long-term, high- volume buying. Again when quality parts often could not be obtained in a timely fashion to supply its customers, WAI added a manufacturing capability to assemble starters and alternators on site. The company went from $1 million in sales in 1980 to $17.6 million in 1985. Then, during a period when most businesses were downsizing, sales soared to nearly $70 million in 1991. By the third quarter of 1992, WAI realized a 22 percent increase over 1991! It is now one of the largest suppliers in its market. Bothe recalls with nostalgia the company’s first pur- chase order in 1980 of $5,000 for bearings. Present pur- chases of bearings are in excess of $12 million yearly. The company also became part of the international business community, importing and expor ting products from and to the Far East, Australia, Brit ain, Europe, North Africa, South and Central America an d Canada. In addition, WAI also established Regional Distribution Centers (RDC’s) 5"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"near Los Angeles, Atlanta, Chicago and Dallas to provide more timely delivery to its customers nationwide. Sophisticated Engineering, Quality Control, Graphic Arts and Technical Training Departments were created and are now major departments in the corporation. Engineering and inspection detail documentation is currently being im- plemented for most of the 6,000 parts in the company’s product line. WAI is privately owned yet 100 percent of its profits are funneled back into the bus iness to fund advanced re- search, inventory and equipment as well as to provide addi- tional facilities, pe ople, training, and em ployee benefits, to become debt-free and to s upport local and national chari- ties. From a start-up group of 34, the company grew to nearly 300 employees in 1992. As a part of his enlightened approach to corporate duties, Wetherill taught that while the science of accounting has no ledger pages for things such as jealousy, competition, company politics, empire building, snits, depression a nd frustration, these human conditions and activities are si gnificantly responsible for corporate prosperity or failure. In all departments, WAI’s position is that if a contem- plated wrong action such as lying would appear to give profitable results, then app earances are deceiving. (The long-term consequences would resemble what our national economy suffers from.) Convers ely, if a right action would appear to produce a wrong resu lt, again appearances are deceiving. (Long-term benefits would reflect the same eco- nomic strength as shown by WAI.) Company policy re- quires that employees take right action and not knowingly take wrong action. Every effort is made to debunk the fan- 6"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"tasy that in the long-term net profit can result from wrong action or that net loss can result from right action. Company Treasurer, Kevin Kr aft, says, “We do not di- rectly try to make profits or avoid losses. Instead, we try to take righ t action as best we know how; the profits are a natural by-product.” Corporate Secretary and Dir ector of Human Resources, Margo Callis, recognizes that he r department is responsible for monitoring the quality of corporate life at WAI and that responsibility is cons idered fundamental. “Cooperation is emphasized. Wrong behavior is given the same careful attention as defective product. Any low- quality behavior is treated as a mistake that is correctable with training and counseling, ” Callis observes. She also points out that prospective employees are screened for their ability to work well in an ope n, cooperative environment as well as for their professionalism or technical competence. WAI has effectively met the challenge of expanding growth and profitability in recessionary times by using the Right-Action Ethic. With pub lication of this book and oth- ers written by Richard W. Weth erill, it is now poised to provide help and instruction on how to develop a similar result for the management and operation of any business or industry. Management Philosophy At the time the first phone calls were made by the young manufacturers’ representa tives at WAI in 1978, their thinking and training had been infused with the manage- ment methodology and teachings of Richard W. Wetherill. For over half a century Wether ill had written books, taught management courses and conducted training seminars for 7"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"some of the nation’s top companies, none of which ac- cepted the whole package of ri ght action and total honesty. At age 72, his influence and trai ning in its entirety was fo- cused directly on one company—WAI, where the Right- Action Ethic became its guiding light. At a time when most of hi s contemporaries had retired from their business careers, Wetherill acted as the com- pany’s management consultant and training executive. For the first time, he was given th e opportunity to demonstrate what constitutes truly successful leadership in the business world. His associates provide d a corporation with a man- agement team that put his behavioral principles into prac- tice and began showing how the Right-Action Ethic inevi- tably works. In a Quality Assurance Manual the company published in 1990, a year after Wetheril l’s death, his Right-Action Ethic is articulated in a three-fold formula for success: • First, let every decision be made by consensus among the persons involved in accord with the dictates of re- ality and not by consensus of personal opinions. • Second, eliminate all considerations of personal ambi- tion and private profit for a few. • Third, make sure that all th inking is centered on con- siderations of what is right for everybody—what will benefit the company as a whol e, its customers, its sup- pliers, its employees and the community. Taken far enough these benefits would encircle the earth. All of the above reasoning is applied to everyday life at WAI and has won the respect and attention of WAI’s cus- tomers in the automotive rebuilding industry here and abroad and of co-suppliers who are also competing for their business. 8"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"In subsequent chapters, the principles of the Right- Action Ethic Wetherill taught ar e given specific attention.

Wetherill Right Is Might 10"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Chapter 2 Doing the Right Thing During the 1980’s, America plunged into a decade of avarice and acquisitiveness. Interest rates soared, prices for commodities and housing skyrocketed. The financial future looked stable, but with the approach of the 1990’s, fear set in. Banks and brokerage houses failed, corporations crum- bled nearly overnight. A few i ndividuals made billions of dollars, but in the process, the economy was weakened and upper management and middle management alike found themselves scrambling to seek other employment. This economic downturn ushered in a period of down- sizing. Bankruptcies soared, both personal and corporate, and millions were laid off as companies went under. The result was a recession described by some analysts as the worst since the Great Depression of 1929. The truth is that the princi ples Richard Wetherill taught and that are WAI’s guiding light might have prevented what has come to pass if they had been implemented across the nation when they were presented decades ago. Unfortu- nately they were not. Now America is facing economic decline, upheaval in its major cities, natural disasters and crises in health care. We must ask: Is there a set of principles, a management approach that can bring about economic and social healing and put America on the right track economically and mor- ally? The answer is yes—it is the Right-Action Ethic . Richard Wetherill postulated that among all the lessons taught by history, the most important was that the forces of 11"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"right ultimately triumph in every long-continued struggle . He taught that the forces of wrong are doomed to ultimate extinction as is evidenced in the lives of every tyrant and oppressor who ever trod this earth. But on a sm aller scale, wrong action is also evident in the wrong results that peo- ple live with in their pers onal and professional lives— wrong results they blame on outside forces of one kind or another, because they cannot understand their own role in causing them. The first step toward creating a successful and produc- tive life is the willingness to do the right thing, to face life honestly and, in doing so, to face your own dishonesty. If you agree that it is wrong not only to lie, cheat and steal but also to neglect responsibilitie s, justify wrong behavior, try to manipulate others, insist on your way or do anything to hurt others, then you must look at yourself squarely and admit that you are doing some of those things. If you are willing to become conscious of your own mistakes and make the decisions that follow, your life will dramatically change, and you will be led in to an extraordi- narily rewarding series of events: Be honest—take full re- sponsibility for your own ac tions and face the truth about yourself—that is what matters. It is important for indi- viduals to take this responsib ility because ev ery individual wrong has a detrimental effect on the common good. A world in which individual good in any way damages the common good does not make sense. The first lesson Wetherill taught for successful living and a successful business then is this: If you, as one indi- vidual, are prepared to be honest in every decision you make, without compromise, you will lead the way into the benign revolution toward total honesty in our society. You 12"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"will, as a natural consequence, benefit yourself and assume a leadership role in putti ng America on the right track. To understand total honesty as an ingredient for doing the right thing, we should firs t discuss what stands in its way: dishonesty. Sadly, there are a number of people whose wrongs have done irrevocable damage from which there may be no escape. Many of us have, at the very least, made so many compromises that our view of total honesty has become distorted. In our so ciety, dishonest habits such as justifying angry outbursts , criticizing and putting people down or projecting a false imag e have become so ingrained that the average person hardly knows what total honesty is. What is more revealing is th at so many dishonest practices are now embodied in our public , private and business af- fairs. Happily most of us have the opportunity to change that destructive state of a ffairs by doing the right thing. Wetherill stated that people fa ll into one of four general categories. Perhaps you will se e yourself in one of them. • First, there are those who like and grow fat on the cor- rupt system of political graft and profits-at-any cost that already exists. If you know one such person, you will discover, before you read much further, that he is not so fortunate as he thinks. • Second, there are those who f eel caught in the system’s vicious coils and consider it practical to go for the short-term advantage. But if the system changes, they will breathe a sigh of relief. • Third, there are those who ar e indifferent and too cal- lous to care what is going on. They invariably give sup- port to the first group. • Fourth, there are those who have broad moral scruples and try not to compromise them. They represent vital landmarks pointing to a better world. 13"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Realistically we ar e in a situation where the first group, the dishonest element, is firmly entrenched in our society. Moreover the indications are th at violence, corruption and financial scheming and ch icanery are on the rise. If you feel, after r eading this, that the situation seems utterly hopeless, don’t despair. When you understand why people get into trouble, you will feel more sympathy than bitterness towards them, and ther efore feel more inclined to help than to condemn them. The truth is: There are no bad people. There are people who make bad mistakes. There are also well-meaning people who are uninten- tionally dishonest in ways they do not suspect. For exam- ple, they may think it is right to fight for peace or do vio- lence in support of a noble cause. They do not understand that it is always a mistake to fight and do violence, even for a cause that seems right. Wetherill found that there are more effective ways to right the wrongs of society. Doing the right thing always has the best possible long- term outcome, but it may sometimes seem more difficult in the short term. For example, when WAI first entered the business community, it was regarded with derision and suspicion. Managers of othe r companies in the industry could not believe that honest y and right action were com- patible with a healthy bottom line. The Right-Action Ethic was regarded by some as a gimmick or a ploy of subtle de- viousness to gain market shar e. Those were the short-term obstacles, but the long-term rewards have been the good will, trust and respect WAI now enjoys in the domestic market as well as in countries as far away as Australia. If you are called a goody-goody or hear rumors spread about the Right-Action Ethic, do not despair. WAI did nothing to defend itself against the wildest accusations, but instead continued to study cust omers’ needs and to respond 14"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"honestly with improved service, literature, quality—in other words to do the right thing. The long-term result is that WAI is a happy place to work, has enthusiastic cus- tomers, cooperative suppliers, friendly competitors, and a broad reputation for integrity and “having it all together.” In addition, its executives and managers are free of the typical burdens that seem insu rmountable in most corpora- tions. While it may be true that you cannot change human na- ture, we do know it is possible to change people’s thinking, and through that, their conversation and behavior so that, by doing the right thing, total honesty can be achieved. To do that, in his book Right Is Might , Wetherill specifically describes two ways to change people’s thinking. One is by persuasion, and the other is by force. Personal force is ruled out as part of the Right Actio n Ethic. Wetherill points out that the old adage is still tr ue: A man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still. But persuasion works, and the simplest and most effective kind of persuasion is that of good example. WAI’s business record provides an example to encourage others to tr y the Right-Action Ethic. Since persuasion is needed to inspire volun tary action, persuasion must offer some pe rsonal advantage or gain, or conversely it must enable a pe rson to avoid some personal trouble or loss. An example Wetherill often used: If you are standing on a railroad track and someone shouts, “A train is com- ing!” you would act on his word and get off the track. But if no one apprised you of your danger, the sight of the track and approaching train would cause you to jump. In other words, the reality would provide the motivation. The victims of dishonest, wrong thinking are in much the same position. They do not see its danger, and the at- 15"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"tempted warning in this book may be ignored. But if you look at the reality of what is happening on all sides, the evidence is clear that too many wrong results are bearing down on us. The good news is that applying the Right- Action Ethic will virtually stop your vulnerability to wrong results, take the effort out of your exertions and enable you to do what you want to do, to the exclusion of what you don’t want to do. Because you want to do the right thing, you are put on the right track. One persuasive method of inducing a change to right action is by depriving some one of a desired opportunity unless that change is made. So metimes that kind of change will come only through sheer economic necessity. At WAI, a condition of employment is th at employees agree to take right action and refrain from taking wrong action. If an ap- plicant needs the job, as most persons do these days, he or she will agree to the Right-Action Ethic. When mistakes occur (and they will), the employee is reminded of the right-action policy and counseled as to how that mistake can be corrected. The following example illustra tes the use of that form of persuasion: Our sales and purchasing people sometimes have to deal with irate calle rs. Right action requires them not to resist but to let the pe rson on the other end vent his emotion and state his case. There may be various reasons for the caller’s outburst that do not even relate to the trans- action. Maybe a valued worker just quit, or he learned that his wife smashed his car. Wetherill taught that such em otion can be reciprocal. If you listen for the information a nd remain calm, the caller’s emotion dies because you are not resisting or supporting it. A rational discussion can then disclose the reality, and complaints are effectively resolved. Try it next time some- 16"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"one tries to engage you in an argument. Just as you can smother a fire by cutting off its oxygen, a fire between or among people is smothered by withdrawing your emotional input. Over the years in his lectur es, Wetherill made it clear that emotional reactions work against a person’s best inter- ests. “Emotion,” he said, “destroys rationality and sends thinking off in a wrong direct ion.” But how does a person drop his emotion when it bubbles up? Wetherill provided his students with a technique which they, in turn, have passed along to others. While appearing childlike to some, it is effective. Here is the technique: When emotion wells up and swirls in your mind, picture a battleship riding on a calm sea. Throw in some moonlight so that a dive bomber be- comes visible in your mental picture. Watch while the plane drops bombs on the ship so that it explodes into thou- sands of pieces of debris fl oating on the surface of the wa- ter. Add some sound effects (s o long as it doesn’t disturb anyone near you) and enjoy the release of emotional ten- sion. Some people picture a steam valve fastened at their wrists. They turn the petcock, and the steam escapes in a hissing cloud—so does their em otion. Others visualize pop- corn kernels in their cupped hands that suddenly pop until their hands are empty. Almost any mental picture of that kind can be used to drain off emotion. As one salesperson reported, “You know, it works.” In the effort to do the right thing, you can withdraw pa- tronage from a store or withhold your vote or refuse to carry out the dishonest instructions of a superior. Your ac- tions might count as only one factor, but it is surprising how often that factor is decisive. 17"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"A lot of dishonesty in busi ness continues only because it is supported and protected by people in surrounding posi- tions. Yet even though mass dishonesty continues, WAI demonstrates that it takes ju st a few people using the Right- Action Ethic to alter the balance of power. You will find it is usually easy to gain recruits for any clearly stated, sound moral cause. Another way to handle dishone sty in direct dealings with another person is to stat e the truth. When that occurs, one of two things ordinarily happens. Either the dishonest person changes his thinking, or he is replaced. At WAI, we have learned that an honest person can succeed easily in relation to a dishonest person on the wrong track. It may require time, but honest people have the force of right working for them. Furthermore, when you get into the habit of doing the right thing, you will discover that direct competition, even in a capitalist economy, is no longer a necessary part of success. Every right purpose can be served without it . As you read further, you will understand that no ag- gressive action is needed to secure a victory for the forces of right. In the meantime, those persons who have already provided the patterns of good influence and example find that their lives flourish as a result. As Wetherill states in Right Is Might , they, and perhaps you, will have demon- strated that right will eventually prevail as the eternal ba- sis of might. 18"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"“The person who lives the Right-Action Ethic benefits everybody on eart h.

Managers are cutting ethical co rners for short-term profits; employees are stealing from their employers both in prod- uct, lost days and costly overt ime, and, worst of all, they are all rationalizing it. Top ma nagers are firing employees to pump up profits for the short term while compensation for top executives keeps spiraling upward. The tendency for doing the wrong thing has proven costly. Dozens of corporati ons are facing mandatory fines that reach into the hundreds of millions for a broad range of crimes that include antitrust violations, breaking securities and contract laws, fraud, di scrimination, unsafe practices, bribery, and money laundering. The end results are not only more and more law firms but a loss of something vital to the nation: moral consci ence, faith, and trust. Deeply troubled by the unethical behavior that he saw even fifty years ago, Wetherill, then in his mid-forties, formed a Behavioral Study Group to counter the disastrous consequences of that wrong thinking. He taught the group that under the right circumstan ces if a person follows and practices the Right-Action Et hic consistently, he can change his life: Always think, say and do what is right; refuse to think, say or do what is wrong. But there are requirements to be met. A person cannot decide he or she is sole arbiter of what is right without re- gard for the consequences of hi s or her behavior in the lives 20"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"of others. While this is not intended to relate to legal entan- glements, it does relate to beha vioral entanglements that are essentially moral. To avoid such entanglemen ts puts no restrictions on anybody’s freedom. Instead their avoidance makes genuine freedom possible. What is more important, to apply the Right-Action Ethic you need common sense, not blind or unquestioning faith. You may not live it perfectly, but it is the ideal, and if you co nsistently apply it to yourself, rather than being restricted, you will gain genuine freedom. Like an electric light switch that sends power to light up a room, the mental switch that produces ethical enlighten- ment is found in the formula: Always think, say and do what is right; refuse to th ink, say or do what is wrong. If you apply this formula, your life will be transformed, and you will be making a contribution to the freedom and safety of all other fellow beings. In a world filled with con- flict and distress, if you live by this formula, you will func- tion with complete calm. Noth ing will disturb your inner emotional balance. You won’t have to seek peace of mind because you will have it! But you will not have on mental blinders about the state of the world nor be able to ignore the troubles of society and pret end that all’s well. You will be a realist. You w ill know what is going wrong and will be doing something constructive about it. You will be living the Right-Action Ethic. You will choose to meet life head on because your skills, energies and ingenuity will be constantly challenged by the opportu- nities and events of life. Furthermore, adoption of th e Right-Action Ethic will relieve you of vocational tr oubles. Whatever you attempt will work out. Life will open up before you and present you with every opportunity you need. You will not be called on 21"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"to serve contradictory purposes or interests, be in two places at once, suffer from anxiety or depression—not while you live in accord with th e principle of absolute right found in the Right-Action Ethic: Always think, say and do what is right; refuse to th ink, say or do what is wrong. Do you want to be such a pe rson? You can. It’s a matter of choice. Do not be diverted by anyone who says, “Some- times it doesn’t pay to do the ri ght thing.” The simple fact is that doing the right thing always pays. The only way to get into trouble is to do the wrong thing. “It’s not expedient,” someone else might say. That is untrue. The terms right and expe dient are identical in mean- ing. Always do the right thing. Ri ght action leads to right results. Wrong action leads to wrong results. Right action cannot lead to wrong results. Wrong action cannot lead to right results. Right can never contradict proper duty; all are identical by definition. At this point, you may be skep tical, but the day has ar- rived when there are many people who realize that the prin- ciple of absolute right is th e crux of man’s relationship to man, and also man’s relationship to God. The members of Wetherill’s Study Group have experienced a renewal of purpose for their lives and are serving that higher purpose to do what is right as best they can. As you read this, you know in what areas you have to make sound moral choices. Once you have done that, ex- tend those areas out. That will give you more freedom be- cause then you will have fewer kinds of troubles. You will recognize that morality consists of recognizing and doing what is right while recognizin g and refusing to do what is wrong. 22"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"A true statement is one that is in exact accord with the facts. A little wrong is as wrong as a big wrong. It is as wrong, for example, to steal one cent as it is to steal a mil- lion dollars. One wrong may lead to more serious conse- quences than another, nevertheless, any wrong is wrong. Whatever your goals and desi res in life are, don’t let them dominate your thinking. Remember: Think, say and do what is right; refuse to think, say or do what is wrong. When you adopt the Right-Action Ethic, even as an ex- periment, your troubles will start correcting themselves. A new light will shine in your eyes, a new spring will rise in your step and a new buoyancy will result from shedding conscious and unconscious burdens . Even in a crisis when there is no time to plan, you w ill tend to take right action. In the crunch you will instinc tively resort to doing what is right. And that is what matters. Make the resolve: “Hereafter, I shall intentionally do what is right!” 23"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 Improving Working Relationships While lecturing, Wetherill sp elled out his ideas about how to improve working relationships, a necessary compo- nent of effective leadership. What follows is an edited ver- sion of one of his lectures. In every business or industri al situation, executives are constantly being forced to use one of two kinds of author- ity. One is technical authority, the other is disciplinary au- thority. Technical authority is the authority a supervisor or manager uses in instructing subordinates how to do their work and meet their job obliga tions. It is essentially nonbe- havioral authority exerci sed over technical activity. Disciplinary authority, on the other hand, is the kind of authority a supervisor or executive uses, in making what he or she thinks are critical correc tions in the behavior of em- ployees. As he is the boss, so is he the disciplinarian. He not only tells employees how to do their work, he must also tell them, at times, to stop and correct their wrong behavior. When technical problems arise, unintentional mistakes are the cause and are easily corrected. When behavioral problems arise, however, there is usually an intentional ef- fort on someone’s part to get th e upper hand or get out of a position that has lost its advantage. It’s important to note that a technical problem is not solved on a behavioral basis. It is solved by identifying and correcting the method or process. In the field of engineer- 24"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"ing, for example, the laws of physics strictly control how the engineering is to be done. It is in the behavioral fi eld that the baffling problems develop. Even when the problem s relate to technical mat- ters, if there is conflict, that c onflict is always behavioral in nature. A lot of conflict fi nds its way into conversation about technical matters. When that occurs, there is a split system, partly technical and partly behavioral. Wetherill taught that there is no such th ing as a purely technical con- flict. As a very young man, We therill discovered that the law of absolute right, Right action gets right results, whereas wrong action gets wrong results, applies to be- havioral problems as inevitabl y as the laws of physics ap- ply to engineering problems. For example, if an employee competes with you for the purpose of getting the upper ha nd, he may try to do the job his way to show how smart he is. At that point technical guidance is rejected and beha vioral conflict is inserted. What has happened is that a behavioral problem has complicated a technical problem because competition for control has now taken over. What is needed is to separate the technical problem from th e behavioral problem. At WAI when a technical mistake is made, a careful analysis usually reveals that the reason for it is behavioral rather than technical. Knowing this can direct your attention to the real underlying problem. Most managers, supervisors and executives in either business or vocational employment know that behavioral problems cause the greatest amount of trouble, wrecking people’s careers, sometimes ev en their lives. When this happens, it becomes the biggest human-resource tragedy in a company. 25"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"All such behavioral problems are correctly defined as conflict. They directly contri bute to other problems that arise such as excessive financial burdens, low morale, em- pire building, high employee tu rnover, stress, chronic fa- tigue, even stomach ulcers and more. Technical Counseling Technical problems can be illustrated by the making of a blueprint or in making the pr oduct that the blueprint de- scribes. Even putting a stamp on an envelope is a technical problem, so it is easy to see that the authority for technical problems is reality itself. All technical work is based on reality, or it does not succeed. Technical problems that arise out of reality will always be a part of normal business or industrial operations. When a high-tech corporation comes out with a better computer than its competitor, the competition’s staff sets about look- ing into the technical achie vements involved. Technical problems are often temporary, because each new achieve- ment is a stepping-stone to further achievements. Wrong impressions of a technical nature are relatively easy to identify and fix. Suppose, for example, that a worker is rushing to do a job, and you criticize him for his haste. When he explains that he has to be finished by 3 o’clock that day, you can correct his wrong impression by saying you meant 3 o’clock the next day. Does the worker go on hurrying the same way? Of course not. That is an ex- ample of a minor technical pr oblem. No behavioral prob- lem is at stake. Technical problems are easy to straighten out and require little attention to fix. Once the reality is seen, you can immediately take the confusion out of the situation. 26"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"It is clear that everybody uses the authority of reality in nonbehavioral problems. For instance, if a key is used to unlock a door, a simple trial de termines whether it works or doesn’t. This is using the auth ority of reality in a nonbehav- ioral way. When a person discove rs the reality that he is using the wrong key, he gives up trying to unlock the door with it. Reality is the final arbiter. Behavioral Counseling Wrong impressions are easily correctable when they re- late to technical problems, unless people let behavioral considerations inte rfere. If you are a line executive or su- pervisor, you should be free to concentrate on technical work, but at times you will be forced to devote attention to disciplinary problems. No matter how capable you are in the technical side of your work, you will have difficulty solving behavioral problems. It may take an outside coun- selor to do that. It should also be noted that when executives and super- visory staff are sidetracked into dealing with the emotional reactions that trigger behavior al problems, they become the victims of distress. This dist ress causes an emotional dis- turbance that often has the e ffect of endangering the entire company’s safety by diverting attention from the require- ments of reality that keep the business healthy. Anyone reading these pages knows that behavioral problems cause the great bulk of vocational problems. These same behav- ioral problems sink many an in dustrial ship and wreck many a promising career. For this reason, executives will find it best to turn be- havioral problems over to people who are skilled in han- dling them. These people have clear thinking and can by- 27"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"pass virtually all personality considerations. When the counselor has the proper skills and understands the situa- tion, he or she can easily dis pose of problems without being irritated by them in the way a manager may be irritated. Having applied Mr. Wetherill’ s procedures at WAI, we know that if you follow them, you can revolutionize not only your working relationships, but all your other relation- ships as well. In business and industry most behavioral problems get settled by the intervention of a person in a position of higher authority—especially if he has the po wer to fire someone who will not give i n. That higher authority does not even have to be right. That is the nature of human au- thority, and it is al ways artificial. No behavioral problem should ever be solved on the sole basis of human authority. In dealing with behavioral problems as with technical problems, we should always resort to the higher authorit y of reality. The information found in the reality should always be the deciding factor in dealing with all behavioral problems. In fact, this principle is so important that to be an effective counselor you do not need to have “official” authority at all. When an authority figure tries to be the person who deals with a behavioral problem as the counselor, his authority may actually be a handicap. When decision making is done on the basis of reality, the authority of individuals becomes irrelevant. To be fully effective, that is the way c ounseling should always be done. When personal authority is exerted, it spoils th e prospect of allowing the authority of r eality to become visible. Since most people are inclined to use personal authority in relation to behavioral probl ems, that complicates things almost every time. It becomes a battle of wills: “I want it 28"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"done my way.” “No, I’m going to do it my way.” Resorting to personal authority explains most of the conflicts in the workplace, at home and in na tional and international af- fairs. Furthermore we are going to keep on having such conflicts until the story of beha vioral reality is understood everywhere. In the behavioral field, few people want to look at the appropriate reality, and that is the reason we have behav- ioral problems. Because these problems are customarily dealt with on the basis of conflict and competition, it is not surprising they do not yield to treatment. Human authority is used in dealing with behavioral problems in phrases such as: “If you do that again, I’ll fire you,” “Stop that or I’ll smack you down” or “You’ll give in to me, or you’ll wish you had.” Human authority? Perhaps we should say inhuman authority. In any counseling situation th at you want to resolve, re- ality must be seen. When it is not clear, bus iness and indus- trial counselees should ask, “What is it that I do that makes you describe me that way?” Of course, ideally you should have carefully described the counselee’s behavior without being asked. When he or she has to ask, it demonstrates a failure to provide certain of the information that would have directed everybody’s at tention to the reality. No matter how careful the participants are, such prob- lems can and do arise; it is easy to make a mistake. If so, a mistake is easily corrected. However, when the resistance is intentional, anything can happen. If either the counselee or counselor fails to understand the contributing factors that caused the counseling to be needed, each should make i nquiries of the other. Nobody ever attempts to defend himself or herself in relation to a technical problem unless it spills over into a 29"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"behavioral problem. The technical action is either right or wrong. Attack and defense have nothing whatever to do with the outcome unless a behavioral problem intervenes. When it does, since people compete and are jealous of one another, behavioral problems almost always intrude be- cause one of the parties wants his own way. When that happens, a technical problem is turned into a behavioral problem, and the end result is trouble. Whether a problem is technical or behavioral, people, rightly or wrongly, are forced to reason from the impres- sions they have formed. They cannot do anything else. The counseling should disclose th e overlooked reality so that impressions are corrected. Wrong impressions of a techni- cal nature are read ily correctable so long as behavioral problems do not interfere to co mplicate matters. When they do, only the facts of the situa tion will resolve the misunder- standing. At WAI a situation developed during a period when the warehouse departments were being moved to other loca- tions within the warehouse. It was a hot, muggy day in early summer. Two department heads found themselves at odds over where the line should be drawn to physically separate their departments. E ach thought he needed the lar- ger space. Antagonism mounted and angry words were ex- changed until a couns elor with Wetheri ll training stepped into the fray. Without pulling rank, the counselor immedi- ately defused the emotion by stating points of reality in the situation: the need for larger space by one department, the fact that the move was a temporary step and that a safety factor was involved. The technical solution became imme- diately obvious when statements of reality removed the emotion from the discussion. 30"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Under ordinary circumstances, two good working friends could have been driv en permanently apart by emo- tional grudges aimed at each other. Instead, each one sheepishly faced his own wrong behavior, and both came out winners. So did the co mpany. Commonly most solu- tions to these problems are im posed on the basis of human authority with such words as, “J ust do as I say,” or “This is the way it is going to be,” or “There will be no further dis- cussion; my decision is final.” The truth is, that approach neither solves nor resolves an ything; it simply perpetuates problems by suppressing them. When behavioral problems arise between a person in a supervisory position and a s ubordinate, they can produce antagonistic feelings that put a blight on communication between those two persons. Wh en a supervisor is con- fronted by an antagonistic empl oyee, it is better to have a third party step in to handle the problems to avoid damage to the welfare of the business. The outside mediator can take the heat out of the disagreement between them. The way behavioral problem s are truly solved, of course, is not by technical m eans. It is by applying the Right-Action Ethic and droppi ng the wrong behavior caus- ing the problem. It is important to release persons in key positions in the company from the necessity to deal with behavioral prob- lems. Of course, in some cases the problems can be dis- posed of quickly in a sentence or two. In these cases, be- cause of the nature of the misunderstanding, almost any- body available can work out those problems efficiently and with little rancor. However, th e energies of key persons in the company should be used fo r the technical problems that relate primarily to the reality of the way the business should run. 31"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Precautions When behavioral counselin g goes astray, one or the other or both of two reasons are responsible: Either impor- tant information was left out or incorrect information was included. This happens by accidental misunderstanding or by intent. However, there is a much mo re serious problem that is nearly always present. It is so common that it is rarely seen as a problem, although it is the real reason why people have so much trouble giving and receiving counseling. It relates to something that deserves to be called “brutali ty” but is not thought of in that sense. We hear a lot today about police brutality, spousal brutality, brutality of children and sexual brutality. However, there is a thread of brutality that is woven through virtually all hum an relationships that is rarely thought of as such. Incr easingly such brutality is the rule rather than the exception in our dealings with one an- other. An example of such brutality was witnessed recently in a local sales organization—not WAI. At a meeting of the sales staff, the top salesper son was applauded, praised and awarded a prize for his high sales. When the cheering had stopped, the bottom salesperson was announced so that everybody attending the meeting could pelt that person with Styrofoam wafers provi ded for the purpose. Don’t shake your head in disbelie f—it really happened. Such methods might generate more sales in the short term, but in the long term, they impose emotional damage and scars and increase employee turnover. In a limited sense, such brutality gets carried over into every counseling session until people learn to avoid it. It tends to persist even when efforts are made to keep it out, 32"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"and it constitutes the deepest reason why most counseling fails to achieve genuine success. While the brutality re- ferred to is usually only verb al abuse, nevertheless, harsh words and tones of voice ar e inescapably damaging to working relationships. In order for counseling to be effective, it is essential to get rid of the attack tactics so prevalent in interpersonal re- lationships: belittling, putdowns , squelches, sarcastic or snide remarks. The correct proced ure is simply to fill in all the details of reality, which will have the effect of eliminat- ing the emotional details that have developed. It is easy enough to do. If you try to do it, you will do it. If you do not do it, it is because you ar e trying to do something else. Participants have to limit themselves to the require- ments of reality with no pe rsonal reactions. You have to listen to correct information; you have to listen to incorrect information. You must be prepared to reason the informa- tion to the ground, determine what the reality is and then base your decisions on that reality. People are sometimes afraid to try this approach, but fear has only one intelligent us e: to turn attention in the right direction. Everybody should be afraid to deviate from reality in any detail of his th inking or conversation or be- havior. Of course, both you a nd the counselee can make mistakes. However, a promptly corrected mistake is not serious. On the whole, emotional reactions can be used as a sig- nal that the steps required fo r successful counseling are not being followed. The moment some one begins to attack or defend his position, you will know that the counseling pro- gram has gone off the track, and it will not succeed until it gets back on the right track. 33"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Nobody will ever attack another or defend himself when he sees all the reality correctly; instead he is guided by that reality. There is no need for emotion in dealing with technical problems. Behavioral problems, on the other hand, generate emotion and are virtually impo ssible to deal with success- fully in the presence of that emotion. It can be truly said that if there is no emotion, there is no behavioral problem. You need to know that it is emotion that cl ouds a person’s intelligence, makes him eager to do something he should not do and confuses him so th at he does not see anything wrong with it. It must be understood that the same emotion that pushes a person toward wrong action b linds him intellectually so that he cannot see the wrongne ss. Typically, he does not want to see it. He wants to win his point. Since emotional reactions ha ve to be eliminated com- pletely to resolve behavioral problems, your thinking has to be based entirely on reality and not on urges based on per- sonal desires. It can be done by applying the Right-Action Ethic and letting real ity lead the way. 34"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"“Each individual doing what he knows is right and refusing to do what he knows is wrong ensures a secure future.” Richard W. Wetherill Right Is Might  35"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Chapter 5 Leadership into the 21 st Century This book is about leadership in business and indeed life itself. It is about how to develop leadership qualities, starting from a whole new set of premises that people have customarily failed to consider. You will discover that to think, say and do the right thing is as essential to leadership in the business of running a succ essful company as it is in family and community life. In recent years dozens of books on the subject of lead- ership have appeared on the shelves of the nation’s book- stores. Several have reached be stseller status. With few ex- ceptions common threads can be found woven throughout them all. They are these: There is a vacuum in leadership in America. Celebrities are not l eaders. Leaders are made, not born. Leaders have vision, wi sdom and often a personal power that is attractive and a ppealing to their followers. In this book, you will find a new approach to leader- ship—dynamic and “doable”! Richard Wetherill under- stood that true leadership is expressed when you make it your intent to let yourself be led by reality. Leadership is achieved by following the path that reality plots as you think, say and do the right thing and refuse to do the wrong thing. In this final chapter you will learn why real leaders are in such short supply. Wetheril l’s message here deals di- rectly with what constitutes leadership and the skills neces- sary to manage people. 36"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Since the Industrial Revolution, the usual model in business leadership has been hi erarchical: top-down leader- ship. Business tycoons who ama ssed great fortunes, for in- stance, were autocratic, domineering, and used personal pressure to get the job done. The end result, however, was often disgruntled employees, inferior products and the ne- cessity for labor unions. While not every business and in- dustrial leader was like that, this model prevailed in most businesses. In his book, How to Get Leadership and Influence , Wetherill shows that the basic ingredient of true leadership is a guiding standard, a standard that will carry an ordinary person to the highest level of leadership and reward him with feelings of deep sati sfaction for a job well-done. You can find that standard in the infallible formula: Think, say and do what is right. If that formula is fol- lowed, all the other requirements will fall in to place. Also present will be a sense of integrity and a kind of sixth sense to know what each situation calls for. That guiding standard of doing what is right can be found at WAI. And it works. Wetherill defines integrity as honesty with self, candor with others and maturity of attitude. Integrity is the basis of trust, which is not so much an ingredient of leadership as it is a natural product. Integrity is a quality that develops in the leader when he follows the “right” path. Wetherill understood that in dealing with reality, a per- son is dealing with the only viable force able to change people’s behavior from wrong to right action. In making that change from wrong to right, character is formed, peo- ple’s lives improve and cor porations are turned around. This kind of character is as vi tal in a leader as energy and competence. Energy and competence do not replace vision 37"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"and character. It is not e nough for a leader to do things right; he must do the right thing. Wetherill taught that to all his studen ts. Nearly all the young men and women who formed WAI initially (most of whom are still with the company) had formerly endured deeply troubled lives, many w ith ingrained and addictive behaviors that needed to be dealt with and expunged before they could be given leadership roles. Over the few months Wetherill counseled them, their lives straightened out. They stopped smoking, drinking, doing drugs, vandalizing, defy- ing authority and engaging in risky sex. Now they are lead- ers. By reasoning from realit y, they conquered their fears, self-doubts, and addictive beha viors. Today they stand as models of rectitude, humbled by past experiences, grateful for the healing in their lives, and leading a corporation that will possibly rank in the top 1000 U.S. corporations in the 21st century. Most executives today will argue that the average worker does not possess leader ship ability. Wetherill had a different view. He said that while the average worker showed little evidence of abilities to lead, he does innately possess them, and if stimulated, his leadership abilities will develop. While acknowledging that many workers do not desire positions of leadersh ip, lack ambition and would rather avoid the problems of responsibility, Wetherill makes the point that people are forced, at one time or an- other during their lives, to pl ay leadership roles. The lead- ership may only be needed to fulfill family obligations or simply participate at social gatherings, but it is there. According to government stat istics, a high percentage of American businesses employ fewer than ten workers so the majority of business owners have only a small handful of employees to direct. But if a person asks any sort of 38"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"question, he is looking to someone else for leadership. In fact, whenever you give another person guidance or offer direction (even to a family member), provide training, cor- rect people’s mistakes, induce people to try harder, stimu- late them to think more, give instructions or orders, im- prove confidence or morale, you are exercising leadership. Wetherill wrote that truly effective leadership could better be characterized as guidance . “Using the word guid- ance,” he said, “deflects the in stinct for power inherent in most relationships. People who try to exert leadership most often get into trouble. Egos clash, motives contradict and opposition from competitors is stimulated. People who di- rectly assume the title of ‘leader’ invite repercussions, and hurdles appear that could ot herwise have been avoided. Furthermore, the person who blatantly asserts his leader- ship will be tempted to focus attention on himself rather than on the action that should be taken. To be a successful leader, a person should think primarily of guiding others to do the right thing. “By using the concept of guidance, you are also less likely to impose your will on so meone else, and because it also carries no flavor of intim idation, you invite little resis- tance. Above all, it carries with it the preservation of the other person’s dignity.” As an example, Wetherill cited an instance in which, while driving up a mountain ro ad, he encountered a motor- ist trying to jack up his ditche d car. As the man worked, the jack kept driving deeper into the mud. “When I saw his di- lemma I immediately offere d to help. Methodically I started collecting stones to build a foundation for the jack. Suddenly my wife leaned out the window of our car and shouted, ‘Why don’t you get all these men to just lift the car back on the roadway?’ 39"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"‘What men?’ I snorted. “To my surprise I looked up and saw a semicircle of men watching my labors. They had left their cars and walked ahead to see what was blocking them. About a dozen immediately stepped forw ard, and we lifted the car back onto the roadway. “Here is what this story demonstrated. Let reality gov- ern the situation. Unless your guidance affords the best available means of meeting a situation, it will be easy for somebody else to supplant your leadership. Moreover, it will be to your advantage to let him do it. “By popular consent my wife had been placed in the leadership position. Because she was alert to what was go- ing on, she produced the ideal solution to the problem, and nobody resented her intrusion. Everybody benefited by the result.” From this encounter, we learn several things. The first is that the relative position or status, intelligence or author- ity of any of the participants may be irrelevant to the situa- tion. Secondly the person who gives correct guidance is in contact with reality and is the one who knows what ought to be done. Everybody else falls into line. While admittedly it may be harder to get your guidance accepted by someone who consid ers himself your superior; nevertheless when that guidance is urgently needed, care- fully conceived and well presented, it will get results. A case in point is a child who is sent to bed for obstrep- erous behavior in th e presence of guests. Thirty minutes later the child appears and says through his tears, “Even if you spank me again, I have to tell you the bathroom curtain is on fire!” This is an example of a child, in a subordinate position, exerting his will against his parents’ expressed wish. Everybody present is thankf ul for the child’s courage. 40"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"In this same way, managers should let subordinate em- ployees lead when they have the necessary information. Wetherill makes the point that a person who has a superior position in a business situation does not really need to exert his authority at all; he can get best results entirely by elicit- ing voluntary cooperation. Authority is usually understood as the right to demand obedience, and to be fully effective, it must be backed up by the threat to use force. Since au- thority in business or indus try cannot be backed up by physical force or violence, the worst you can do is to fire the person. But by firing an em ployee, you admit an inabil- ity to direct him or her. The truth is, punishment and the threat of punishment are tools of fear. They are s ubstitutes for effective leader- ship. In a sense, they are in struments of slavery and dicta- torship. If an employee suffi ciently objects, he could find another job or file a grievance. In an ideal organization no di scipline is ever used. And a leader who stimulates vol untary cooperation from his employees will inevitably get better results than one who persists in using an approach that expresses brutality. As a leader you should avoid saying and doing what your workers will resent. Inst ead find ways to stimulate their interest, imagination a nd enthusiasm. That approach will release their higher energies and creative abilities. You will discover that the worker who wants to do a good job will almost invariably prove more productive than the one who has to. Wetherill states that, in his experience, when enlight- ened management policies guided employees through lead- ership rather than “drivership,” the result was an increase in production levels by as much as 30 percent. 41"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"We can only conclude that what the average leader or supervisor urgently needs is not more discipline but more disciples . The question is, how to get them? Wetherill defined authority as the ability to command confidence and respect because you deserve them through your own competence and reliabili ty. You can use that kind of authority to get voluntar y cooperation by stimulating employees’ ambitions and pointi ng their abilities in the di- rection of constructive results. To obtain the best from your employees, your authority must rest on a sense of compe- tence and personal effectiveness rather than on raw power backed by disciplinary force. When you use the authority of competence, you can sit on the sidelines and run a business without seeming to be the boss. Wetherill recounts the story of a man who bought a business and conducted it in th is manner for almost a year before his employees found out he was the new owner. “I wanted to get a line on what was happening, and I also wanted to earn the employees’ confidence in advance, to be sure the news that I was the new chief would come as no shock.” As a leader, when your subordinates’ first desire is to please you by doing the right thing, you will have no trouble with discipline. Conventional wisdom has it that authority is the right to demand obedience based on your ability to threaten and deliver actual punishment. Authority in this sense is dele- gated by stockholders to a board of directors to the officers and executives to the lowest supervisor. Delegated author- ity of the conventiona l kind, to be effectiv e, must carry real not implied power. If you don’ t have delegated authority, don’t try to use it; somebody might call your bluff. It is good self-discipline to exercise your own ability to stimu- late voluntary cooperation, and when you can do this at 42"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"will, it won’t matter whether you have delegated authority or not. Anybody can swing a club, but it takes real leader- ship ability to get along without one. It gets great results, too! The key to real leadership is to emphasize your respon- sibilities rather than your authority, and develop your fac- ulty for carrying out those re sponsibilities well. Get people to do as they should by making them want to, and you will have a really universal tool for getting things done. In his book, How To Get Leadership and Influence , Wetherill stated that there were universal problems in hu- man relationships and univers al solutions to those prob- lems. He pointed out that if you conduct each relationship with due regard for the principles of the Right-Action Ethic, you will have little troubl e. You will, he said, create unending opportunities to succeed, not only for yourself but also for the people with wh om you deal. When you practice the Right-Action Ethic, you can expect the best of your employees, and with proper encouragement, determine what may be blocking them to release them from that blockage, enabling them to pe rform to their full capacity. WAI’s attitude is that if you channel people into the right departments you can expect great things from them. They will, in return, give you the best they can. At WAI, Callis says, “That doesn’t mean we are foolish about what we can expect from people. We stretch people; we don’t strain them. At every turn in the road, we look at the reality of the situation and let that determine our deci- sions. We try to let reality govern everything.” When someone looks at WAI, one is astounded by the fact that few of its leaders and managers have had much formal business training. Here is a corporation with sales of 43"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"$80 million, growing by leaps and bounds, run by people who have complete confidence in the Right-Action Ethic. They are not harried and work with smiles on their faces. While many of them barely made it through high school, their ability to follow the path reality has laid out for them provides the guidance they need. Some of their backgrounds would give serious pause to employment officers in majo r corporations. But WAI is different. The Right-Action Ethic Richard Wetherill taught not only gives these people a new outlook on life, it has lifted them up to levels of thinking and leadership that would make directors of business schools around the coun- try draw their breath. They are making it work, and they enthusiastically regard their da y-to-day activities as the un- folding of a master plan that will bring peace on earth as everybody learns to adhere to the Right-Action Ethic. Ms. Callis, whose life was in chaos before she met Wetherill, openly admits that he put her on her feet. And the result? She now heads th e Department of Human Re- sources at WAI and is responsib le for the smooth coordina- tion of nearly 300 people. She has taught herself how to use computers, talks confidently about settling disputes be- tween employees by directing attention to Right Action, gives confidence to the apprehensive, reassures the self- doubters, focuses employees’ strengths in areas where they are best suited and has implemented the Right-Action Ethic in her marriage as well as on the job. You, too, can become one of these Wetherill-trained leaders poised for the future. You can be strong, confident and ready, when you adopt the style of reality leadership that guarantees to maximize not only your own strengths but the strengths of those you work and live with. 44"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"In today’s corporate culture, every policy change molds the company’s style of doing bus iness. While this is often thought of as abstract and uni mportant, that style has sig- nificant impact on everything that occurs in the company. The corporate culture, therefore, can determine the com- pany’s long-term survival—or demise. At WAI the underlying culture is devoted to doing what is right and refusing to thi nk, say or do what is wrong. When the Right-Action Ethic is understood and practiced, everything else falls into place. The bottom line takes care of itself as a natural by-product. Because harmony prevails, productivity is automatically high. No one is pushing any- body—reality is the boss. The following outline on “Leadership” from Wetherill’s Management Techniques for Foremen provides guidelines for gaining a leadership role. Apply each sentence to your own situation, and you will find sidelights and implications turning on in your mind. 1. Develop your workers’ confidence in your leader- ship: A Constantly give your wo rkers training that will improve their ability B Treat each person as an individual C Let each individual know how he stands with you D Never block anyone’s progress E Treat each worker with respect F Make judicious use of criticism and praise. 2. Keep your workers feeling good about their jobs: A Show plenty of enthusiasm yourself B Set performance levels to stretch each worker’s ability 45"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"C Let each worker know that you value his ideas D Protect your workers from unpleasant surprises E Never make an unreasonable request F Hold the Right-Action Ethic as incentive for workers. 3. Go out of your way to stimulate favorable attitudes: A Think and talk in constructive, favorable terms B Build up the prestige of each worker C Make each one want to get your favorable atten- tion D Learn what your subordinates want to accom- plish; help them do it E Build their confidence in their performance F Let each worker know he can count on you for help. At all times WAI puts major focus on behavior. With the focus on doing the right thing, customer satisfaction is given a high priority. Custom er needs are met. Customer complaints are taken very seriously. With mistakes quickly acknowledged, problems are prom ptly resolved, and every- body moves ahead together. “We correct the performance, not the worker. We try never to embarrass the person, and we realize that often the most blatant forms of wrong action may be unintentional. Mistakes are treated as corre ctable misunderstandings. The thrust is to be helpful, impartial and not critical,” says Cal- lis. Wetherill’s Management Techniques for Foremen out- lines a five-step techniqu e for handling problems: Step 1 - Reduce any problem to a specific question Step 2 - Improve the wording until it defines your prob- lem exactly Step 3 - Get a selecti on of possible answers 46"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Step 4 - Choose the practical ideas that you intend to use Step 5 - Weave them into a specific plan of action. At WAI, employees are traine d to avoid making critical judgments of people, whether customers, suppliers or co- workers, which causes them to hold grudges that only hurt. Department heads try to dis tinguish between intentional problems (consistent lateness) and unintentional problems (persons with short fuses w ho blow up). Wetherill taught that everybody has the capacity to change; people just have to be shown how. In daily activities at WAI, wrong action calls attention to itself by the wrong results it gets. Right action can re- place wrong action with co rresponding right results. Threats therefore are unnece ssary. Misunderstandings are never held against people, ev erybody is treated with dig- nity, and the reality of right results makes the lasting im- pression. In business and social life, pe ople ordinarily are told to benchmark against other companies and other people. At WAI, employees benchmark against the Right-Action Ethic. This is highly reco mmended to everybody. It keeps companies and individuals reaching for top-quality per- formance in all areas rather th an being satisfied with “good enough.” To benchmark against right action also enables a person not to take himself too seriously so that he can ap- proach life and business with a sense of humor. The net result of right th inking, good nurturing and co- operation at WAI is that interpersonal stress within the company is almost nonexistent and severe illnesses are few. “When the force of right ac tion that reflects the func- tioning of the universe is follo wed,” says Wetherill, “peo- ple are in harmony with natu re, with one another and 47"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"within themselves.” The Right-Action Ethic provides a uni- fying force for all who adopt it. It makes strangers into friends, the frightened into the confident, the weak into the strong; and a true kinship am ong all members of the human family is born. That is the success story of Wetherill Associates, Inc. It can be any company’s success story. It can be your personal success story. 48"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Postscript Very often the principals of successful companies are asked questions such as: What advice would you pass on to someone else? To whom do you credit your success? Do you feel that you have a mi ssion in life? And so on. Those questions pose no difficulty at Wetherill Associ- ates, Inc. The answers are give n on every page of this book: Think, say and do what is righ t; refuse to think, say and do what is wrong. In order to do that, there is one requirement that has to be met, and it is crucial: It must be your intent in life to do the right thing at all times as best you can. When you find you can’t, look for your intent to do or be something other than to be right. Don’t make it your primary goal to suc- ceed; to be a leader; to make money; to be popular and well-liked; to be a good boss, worker, spouse, parent; to help your fellowman; or even to save the world for future generations. The simple intent to do what is right in every situation of life will give you all of those things and more. The purpose of this book is to share with you the in- formation given to us by Mr. Wetherill so that you can dis- cover why and how effective leadership is found in the un- folding reality of life when it is your intent to do what is right. The change that people desi re on America’s social and political scene will not be found by exchanging one per- son’s ideas on how to rescue the country and put people back to work for another person’s ideas. The genuine change can come only when there are enough persons with 49"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"the intent and courage to align themselves with the forces that run the universe, including the force of right. The in- visible moral force becomes visi ble in the results we get: Only right action gets right results; only wrong action gets wrong results. When we align ourselves with right action, it gives us the kind of leadership that will put America on the right track and take her into the 21st century with true liberty and justice for all.

Bob Tracy Vice President of Operations AMERICAN CARBON INDUSTRIES Steubenville, OH 54"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"About Mr. Wetherill Richard W. Wetherill was born in Old Bridge, New Jer- sey on August 3, 1906, the son of Richard Wayne Wether- ill, a civil engineer, and Mary Roberts Wetherill, a school- teacher. From 1912 to 1928 he attended public schools in the Philadelphia area, and Antioch College in Ohio. At the age of 23, he embarked on a teaching career and began giving evening classes on Public Speaking and Crea- tive Thinking at the Poor Richard Club in Philadelphia and at YMCA’s in Atlantic City, Trenton, Chester and Phila- delphia. Early on he was committed to a business life that was to be marked by the highest ethical principles. From 1929 to 1940, he continued his motivational management classes within the business and professional communities in and around the Delaware Valley. In 1928 he married a local Philadelphia girl, Lou B. Davis. They were together fo r 61 years until his death in 1989. They had no children. From 1941 to 1945 he worked for the Edward G. Budd Manufacturing Company while simultaneously publishing his newsletter, The Creative Thinker , Volumes 1 and 2 which was issued in 1941 and 1942 until the paper shortage of World War II forced its interruption. While at the Budd Company, Mr. Wetherill became their Training Executive and introduced the Wetherill Management Seminar that he had developed in the 1930’s. During his years with Budd, he compiled and wrote the first comprehensive book on foremanship under the title, Management Techniques for Foremen , along with a Leader’s Guide for teaching foremen the principles out- 55"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"lined in the Foremanship book. The books were published by National Foremen’s Instit ute in 1945. National Fore- men’s Institute also published other material by Wetherill on how to train assistants and similar management topics. In 1946, Mr. Wetherill resigned from the Budd com- pany and became a management consultant so that he could work with smaller corporations and help them grow— which they all did. For the next 13 years the Weidemann Machine Com- pany used his consulting services, during which time the company grew steadily. During hi s career as a management consultant, he also wrote th ree books under the general ti- tle, The Dynamics of Human Relations . Each was a “how to” book: How To Succeed with People, How To Get Your Ideas Across , and How To Get Leadership and Influence. The three books were publis hed on the same day in 1949 by D. Van Nostrand Co., New York and Toronto. They were placed in U.S. Military Libraries all over the world. In January 1952 Wetherill published the first book out- lining his behavioral study wh ich he called humanetics. The book was titled Tower of Babel , and later in the year, his second book on humanetics, Truth Is Power , was pub- lished. The Right-Action Ethic grew out of the humanetics study. In 1954, Mr. Wetherill delivered a number of lectures on management principles for the Cadillac Motor Car Divi- sion of General Motors Corpor ation, and in 1958, he con- ducted a weeklong series of l ectures for the Plant Manage- ment Training Division of the General Motors Institute in Flint, Michigan.

In 1959 he resumed publication of The Creative Thinker , and by 1981, he had published Volumes 3 through 21 as well as a score of books for use by members of the Behavioral Study Group. In 1978, 34 of his trainees formed the company, Wetherill Associates, Inc. (WAI), and until his death in 1989, he continued to meet with them and present training in the Right-Action Ethic for ma nagement and leadership in business and in private life. 57"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" 58 Books by Richard W.
