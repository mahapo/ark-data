You never know where you will end up or who will help.You never know what burning questions the detective work will raise as themystery deepens. More than once, I asked myself, how did I get here? Why am Ireading about iodine and syphilis in the 1800s? Why did I just buy a Civil Wariodine canteen from eBay? How can this information ever help people in thepresent day? Who cares about iodine anyway? Fortunately, the global village thatis the iodine online community cares and has created a bounty of resources thatkeeps growing. There are many to thank.The Iodine Project founded by the pioneering work of Guy E. Abraham, MD, DavidBrownstein, MD, and Jorge Flechas, MD, created the touchstone for the iodineresearch which followed. I and others express our profound indebtedness to thesephysicians for not only revolutionary thinking but for transforming so manypeople’s lives. The legacy lives on. I hope this book will exist as just one ofmany which examine the Iodine Project’s significance to medical history.Lucky for me, many other non-doctors shared my enthusiasm for chasing down thequestions: Where did Iodine come from? Why did it disappear? How can we revivethe information of The Golden Age of Iodine? We call this obsession The AbrahamEffect because Dr. Guy Abraham, the father of the Iodine Movement, infected uswith the incurable curiosity about iodine.I’m indebted to many who inspired and supported my effort to write The IodineCrisis.

Lynne Farrow has written an easy-to-read book that will helpmany who suffer from common medical ailments including fatigue, brain fog,thyroid disorders and breast disease. Ms. Farrow’s description of the benefitsof iodine therapy makes for compelling reading. Furthermore, this book describesthe long history of iodine usage in medicine and why iodine has fallen out offavor with conventional medicine.Lynne describes her own journey from becoming ill to obtaining good health.After a myriad of complaints, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. She givesher first-hand account of her experiences with oncologists and other doctors.Lynne was not satisfied with the information her conventional doctors wereproviding her. They could not answer her questions about why their recommendedtreatment plan would be the best option for her. Being a journalist, Lynne didher own research into breast cancer and found that iodine deficiency may be abig missing link into why so many women are being diagnosed with cancer. Thisbook describes that journey and presents the information about iodine and breastcancer that anyone can understand.There is a plethora of research relating iodine deficiency to breast diseasesincluding breast cancer. In fact, the research dates back well over 70 years.Yet, conventional medicine is stuck in their model of surgery, chemotherapy,hormonal therapy, and radiation, all of which have done almost nothing to changethe course of the illness in over 70 years. In fact, the only thing changingover the last 70 years is that more and more women—nearly 1 in 7—are beingdiagnosed with breast cancer. After finding the research relating iodinedeficiency to breast cancer, Lynne took matters into her own hands and startedsupplementing with iodine. She immediately felt better and had many positivehealth benefits which she describes in the book. After this experience, Lynnewas off to the races and began her quest to inform people about iodine. Thispath led her to found Breast Cancer Choices, Inc., which I have referred manypatients to.The most striking part of this book are the numerous case studies. From fatigueto psoriasis, headaches and cancer, people have sent Lynne their personal storyabout how iodine therapy improved their health. Many of the stories may seemunbelievable. However, they are not to me. I have been prescribing iodine forwell over 10 years. I hear similar stories from my patients on a daily basis.Unfortunately, for most patients their doctor has no knowledge about iodinetherapy. In fact, most doctors think iodine is a dangerous substance that shouldbe avoided. I should know. I have been writing and lecturing to doctors foryears about the benefits of iodine. I can assure you that it is difficult to geta doctor interested in iodine therapy. They don’t seem to understand that iodineis an essential ingredient—that life itself is not possible without adequateiodine levels.Over the last 40 years, iodine levels have declined over 50 percent. Theconsequences of this decline are severe—including epidemic increases inillnesses of the breast, thyroid, ovaries, uterus, and prostate. Unlessconventional medicine devotes its vast resources to searching for underlyingcauses of these illnesses we will continue to see suboptimal results with theirtherapies. Conventional medicine has truly failed us all in its lack of concernfor what is actually cusing this epidemic rise in illness. It continues to bestuck in a diagnostic and treatment mode. Ultimately, we will not makeconsistent and definitive progress against these illnesses unless we understandwhat the underlying causes behind them are. I feel the large increase in chronicillnesses could be explained by deficiencies of essential nutrients, hormonalimbalances, and an increased exposure to toxic elements.The resources section of this book tells you how to test for iodine deficiencyand how to avoid problems when taking iodine. I hear complaints from some of mycolleagues that iodine causes side effects. They are right—anything, iodinetherapy included, can cause adverse effects. However, the correct use of iodineis not associated with too many adverse effects. The information that Lynne haswritten in The Iodine Crisis can teach you how to minimize side effects withiodine. These are the same steps I recommend to my patients.I believe this book should be on every bookshelf. The information found in itcan help you and your family avoid a preventable health problem. I highlyrecommend this book to anyone interested in improving their health. —David Brownstein, M.D. www.DrBrownstein.com [http://www.DrBrownstein.com] Author of 11 books including: Iodine: Why You Need It, Why You Can’t Live Without It Overcoming Thyroid Disorders Salt Your Way to Health"},{"pageContent":"Introduction [part0005.html#rint]Everybody thinks they know what iodine is. Everybody’s wrong.—Earl FoleyIodine deficiency wrecked my life. For years I endured headaches with brain fogso bad that I lost my driver’s license for speeding through stop signs. I sleptso much my family called me Rip Van Winkle, and I could no longer work fulltime, even with caffeine and painkillers. I went from teaching college full timeto working as a journalist part time. I grew overweight from an undiagnosedthyroid disorder and finally, when I thought my life couldn’t get worse, I wasdiagnosed with a life threatening disease.By some turn of fate, Iodine came into my life at just the right time. Dr.Sherri Tenpenny, a doctor I ran into casually at a medical conference, mentionediodine for fibrocystic breast disease. I was intrigued but skeptical. After all,iodine? Surely, she didn’t mean that brown antiseptic bottle in the medicinechest? What was iodine anyway? Didn’t we get enough iodine from iodized salt?Here’s where the medical detective story starts. I decided to research iodine inthe most conservative way; I started with the bounty of medical studies buriedin the National Library of Medicine. Then, I ratcheted up the investigation andhunted down old and out-of-print medical books. I acquired antique iodineproducts from eBay, some with the instructions still intact. When a pharmacist’sledger, dated 1901, went to auction, I snapped it up. Sure enough, it was filledwith countless iodine prescriptions. Records of iodine medicine stretched aroundthe globe, going back a hundred and fifty years as a “universal medicine,” andfurther—15,000 years—in its earlier form as seaweed. Archaeology recordsdocumented how prehistoric peoples hoarded certain seaweeds. In hopes of solvingthe mystery, I began creating an Iodine Timeline to recreate the series ofevents leading up to the time iodine vanished from common use. My intention wasto recreate events leading up to the disappearance of iodine.Why didn’t somebody speak up when iodine suddenly went missing from the medicalarsenal? The plot thickened when I discovered iodine was called “dangerous” by aresearch duo in 1948. Their opinion was contradicted by all the previous yearswhen iodine was used liberally for everything from syphilis to breast cancer. Nomatter. Somehow iodine’s historic benefits were suddenly snatched from themedical text books and largely banned from human research. Why? Who stoleiodine?Why did iodine-fortified bread also disappear in the 1970s? Could something inour environment be working to purge iodine? Why do people excrete half as muchiodine in their urine now than 40 years ago? Is there a conspiracy here or justgoofy negligence? While I was sleuthing the mystery of who stole iodine, Iconcluded I’d researched enough to determine that iodine was safe to consume inlarger doses than the government-published daily requirement.One morning I started the day by swallowing 50 mg of Lugol’s iodine tablets.Boing! My brain came to life. Brain fog vanished. In the months that followed,all the other conditions plaguing me disappeared. My energy improved and myweight normalized. I was no longer so cold I needed to wear two pair of socks.Even superficial things improved. I used to slather my dry hands with handlotion, day and night. Now, I can’t imagine why my hands ever needed extramoisture. The iodine experience seemed too good to be true. If iodine was sogreat, why didn’t everybody know about it?How could one cheap nutrient reverse so many conditions? How did I get so iodinedeficient anyway? I had always eaten seafood and iodized salt. What happened tothe iodine in my food? Where was it going?Then I discovered the newly minted Iodine Project founded by pioneer iodinedoctors, Abraham, Brownstein and Flechas. Here was the mother lode of iodinedetective work! The doctors were already on the case of iodine deficiency andhad been quietly and carefully piling up documentation. On the internet, thefirst iodine experimenters started to appear. More doctors familiarizedthemselves with iodine and tried it themselves. Online groups formed to discussand investigate taking iodine.So many people reported benefits and swapped information that we tried topublish Frequently Asked Questions to lay out the information. We created onlineresources to help those new to iodine.Predictably, skepticism reared its ugly head with online hecklers predictingthat, since iodine was a “poison,” soon we would all die. Some reportedtemporary side-effects, but no one could argue with success stories and thereversal of profound medical complaints. How many others had iodinesupplementation helped? When more and more websites and doctors began to reportthe benefits of iodine, we began to realize a grass roots movement had emergedchallenging the current theory that iodine was toxic.My detective work uncovered evidence iodine had been used in one form or anotherfor 15,000 years. The long medical anthropology of iodine validated itseffectiveness. Iodine wasn’t alternative medicine, it was traditional medicinethat had been lost.The plot thickened again when I discovered the anti-iodine element, bromine, wasadded to flour at the same time iodine was removed—in the 1970s. Iodinedisappeared just as bromines came charging in. Besides bread and flour, brominechemicals became an environmental hazard as they were added to mattresses, foodsand other consumer products, purging much of our dietary iodine.So what do we have? A perfect storm for an iodine deficiency crisis. How did theperfect storm scenario manifest? For starters, thyroid and breast diseaseskyrocketed between 1970 and 2000. Lower iodine levels means IQ levels droppingand obesity rates rising. The iodine crisis made us sick, fat and stupid. Thinkthis conclusion is theoretical? Ask the people besides myself who were allthree—sick, fat and stupid. Many of their stories populate this book.The stories show exactly how people have benefited from iodine, whether it’s alittle or a lot. History tells us when you let people speak in their own words,a revolution begins. Thus, the many first-hand iodine reports carry the messagebetter than any second-hand description could. Read them. The personal storieswill touch your heart.In my role as director of a nonprofit that investigates iodine as a healingstrategy, I get emails from all over the world with stories about iodine. WendyFarrow (no relation) from Canada, a patient in the 1980s of the late iodineinvestigator, Dr. W.R. Ghent, discovered our website and we were able to puttogether lost stories. A Russian immigrant even contacted me about how iodinewas inhaled in Russia to keep germs from respiratory tracts when travelling.People email me before-and-after photographs, thermograms and mammogram films.The success stories keep piling up.We can’t let the stories of the Iodine Movement and its founders be lost to thevapors of history. Someone had to write about how the movement started and howit changed the way we think about arbitrary medical consensus. I’ve done my bestto piece together who did what and when. When Dr. Guy Abraham launched theIodine Movement, he was unaware of the significance of his feat. Many of us whowere the beneficiaries of his revolutionary thinking, believe the Nobel Prize isnot good enough for him. But we are willing to settle.Lastly, The Iodine Crisis was written because those interested in iodine need aplace to find the frequently asked questions and the answers that have developedover the years. The Iodine Crisis: What You Don’t Know About Iodine Can WreckYour Life serves as a patient-to-patient guide—lessons learned on thebarricades. The information contained in the book makes no pretense of beingmedical advice. Please take the reporting in the journalistic spirit with whichit is intended. Spread the word. Lend this book to your doctor. Let’s continueto learn from each other."},{"pageContent":"Part 1 [part0005.html#rpt01]Finding the Iodine Solution—My Journey [part0005.html#rpt01]"},{"pageContent":"Chapter One [part0005.html#rch01]Childhood Curiosity and Discovery [part0005.html#rch01]Study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent andoriginal manner possible.—Richard P. FeynmanWhen I was ten months old, my parents rented a bungalow at the New Jersey shore.They set me on the sand and gave me a yellow plastic shovel.“Dig,” they said.That was all I needed to stay transfixed for over an hour, digging in the sand,looking at the waves roll in, watching the water mysteriously sink into the sandas streaks of plant life piled up and sand crabs scurried. I remained soentranced that my parents later told me they worried I might be “slow.” Everyyear we came back for two weeks and each year I grew more curious as my littlelegs carried me farther. Eventually they gave me a yellow pail for collecting myfinds.In New Jersey, we don’t call the seashore “the beach.” It’s called the “shore”as in “let’s go down to the shore.” This is because the shore is more than thebeach of crashing waves and suntanned bathers. The shore is a terrestrialwonderland with the bays and inlets wandering into curious backwaters. Follow astream of salt water and you find tide pools and salt marshes filled with birdsand plant life so ornate, humans could not imagine them without seeing themfirst hand. With my magic yellow pail and shovel, the earth opened up to me.When I grew a few years older, going for a walk at the shore meant I never knewwhere to direct my eyes. What was the embarrassment of gifts deposited at myfeet? The bird eggs, the seaweeds in more shades of green than I had ever seen,the intricate seashells and edible mussels tangled in sea lettuce. Why did someseaweed look like red hair? I still remember what being close to the ground feltlike, examining each bit of sea-driven mystery in my hand.“You mean I can keep this shell?” I asked. “Can I take the seaweed home?” Howcould any object so precious and magical be free or just left out in nature forthe taking? Looking ceased being enough. My father started turning over what wefound along the beach. When he turned over shells, sand crabs would scurry. Hewould turn over rocks and find cases of eggs.“The Indians ate these,” my father said, when I dug up a clam.images [../images/00001.jpeg]“You can eat that,” he said when we found bladderwrack seaweed. “Lots ofvitamins.”I learned an important lesson from this second step of exploring: you didn’tneed to restrict yourself to looking, then moving on. You could turn overshells, look under rocks. Active participants can learn more than mereobservers.images [../images/00001.jpeg] My parents encouraged my curiosity and bought me a small Golden Book titledSeashores which I memorized without realizing it because I couldn’t stop lookingat the pictures. From the title I learned that the “things” I brought home fromthe shore weren’t just things, but a vast system of living beings. Where did allthese shells and seaweeds come from? How did they fit together? The book taughtme that a curiosity needn’t be idle or instant, that it could take you on a longjourney and open up far-ranging worlds. If it were possible to radiocarbon datethe beginning of my love affair with curiosity, I would write the date myparents put Seashores in my hand. Little did I know that my childhood love andobsession would lead to my eventual success in pursuing the iodine mystery.Childhood “Training” Pays Off—Curiosity Did Not Kill the CatFast forward several decades.As a grown-up, my obsession with all things marine persists, but I could neverpredict a childhood of sand-digging would reinvent itself decades later in amission to learn about iodine. Learning about anything always puzzled me. Inever knew the right way to learn, so I just waded in and tried to connect thedots. This served me well in my academic and journalism careers where Idiscovered a learnable process called “fact checking”—finding the sources ofinformation.images [../images/00001.jpeg]Wise mentors schooled me in how to ask better questions and how to push forwardfurther to ask questions of questions.images [../images/00001.jpeg] Asking, “What’s the source and function of this information?” became a skill Ihoned, a habit, even a reflex. These skills served me well. That is, until Ilost them.As a young adult, I was not well, and in my thirties I began to feel worse andworse. Headaches which had been a problem since my twenties suddenly became aneveryday occurrence. I went to a series of headache clinics around the US. Aseries of other diagnoses came in: hypoglycemia, adrenal weakness,hypothyroidism, chronic fatigue, candida, multiple chemical sensitivities,ovarian cysts, fibrocystic breast disease. I put on extra weight. I felt coldall the time and was a challenge to live with because I was always hungry orlooking for my vial of Darvocet.The chronic, mysterious complaints became very isolating to me because all myfamily members and friends seemed healthy. But in the various doctor’s offices Ivisited, I met a lot of people like me. Their individual complaints may havebeen arranged in a different order of priority, but there were a lot of sickpeople out there searching and not getting results. Some very candid doctorssaid they didn’t know how to treat us. Although they meant well, I grewfrustrated with them. On TV, every illness came with a dramatic diagnosis andinstant cure. Why couldn’t these doctors find the answer for me? How manypatients were out there coping, day-to-day, with no hope in sight?Meanwhile, I tried to impersonate a healthy person, both socially and inbusiness. Here was the stop-gap solution. I only picked jobs where I couldcontrol the amount of time I spent in public. My full-time college teaching jobonly required three days a week, but even that proved too intense with therequirement of being “on” to give lectures and then work one-on-one withstudents. I would come home and fall asleep at six o’clock. My family called meRip Van Winkle. Anyone who has chronic illness will understand you lead a secretlife, arranging your business hours around rest opportunities and findingexcuses for missing weddings or other social events.When I was working as a journalist, an editor phoned, offering me a lucrativewriting assignment that required flying to London to cover a major two-day mediaevent. I was too embarrassed to say crossing the Atlantic twice in three dayswould exhaust me for weeks. So I chirped, “sure” into the phone before Irealized what I had gotten myself into.There would be endless standing around and walking. Sensible shoes wouldn’t cutit. How would I endure standing on my feet for two days? Could I fortify myselfwith Darvocet for the headaches and caffeine to keep me going? That was as faras I got with the plan. The next night, standing in the departure line at VirginAirlines, I began counting the hours until I would be back home, lying on my ownliving room couch.My first day in London, I woke up in the hotel room, walked into the bathroomand promptly broke my toe by stubbing it on the toilet. I saw stars from thepain. Alone, lying on the bathroom floor, nausea swept over me for ten minutesuntil I composed myself. The hotel called a doctor who bandaged me up andordered, “Stay off your feet.”But the temporary physical setback provided surprising advantages. When I wentto press gatherings, I was given preference. Walking around with a big, bandagedtoe meant I got to sit while the other reporters had to stand. The sore toe gaveme an adrenalin surge and made me feisty. When I shouted out questions at thepress conference, I always got answers while the burly and pushy types wereignored. One reporter resented this and complained that “Toe Girl” was gettingmore questions answered than any of the others. My big bandaged toe had turnedwhat I thought would be a sow’s ear into a silk purse.Brain Fog AlertA few years later, I complained to several doctors that I felt “underwater.” Thedoctors called this condition “brain fog.” One doctor told me, “There are thingsworse than brain fog.” Easy for him to say. This frustrating mental impairmentwas worse than the headaches or fatigue, because thinking was the only thing Ihad been trained to do. I used to be able to think privately between naps. If Icouldn’t think straight, I couldn’t write. My brain fog caused several friendsto yelp when I drove unaware through red traffic lights. I got so many traffictickets, the state revoked my license and mandated me to attend bad drivers’school.Even now, when I read my own story it seems unbelievable, but one day from mypre-iodine days reminds me how bad brain fog can get.I had made an appointment with a respected integrative physician in New York.The day of the appointment I allowed extra time because, as anyone with brainfog knows, you tend to get lost. I was living in the city at the time, and all Ineeded to do was take the subway straight downtown from the Upper West Side toMidtown. A no brainer. Still, I allowed a full hour extra time. I dressedcarefully in a blazer and slacks, applied lipstick and headed out of myapartment building for the half- block walk to the subway. What could go wrong?As I descended the subway steps, I looked down to the bottom of my carefullypicked outfit. A pair of fuzzy pink slippers peeked out. Embarrassed, I turnedaround and returned to my apartment for actual shoes.Once more, I headed for the subway for the train downtown. I still had plenty oftime until my appointment, so I stopped in a luncheonette for a sandwich. Butwhen lunch arrived, I couldn’t pay for it because I had forgotten my wallet. Thewaitress brushed off my second embarrassment of the day, telling me I could paythe next time I came in. I was relieved but my confidence was damaged. If Icouldn’t get to the doctor’s office without two screw-ups, how was I going tofind my way home?I entered the midtown office building and took the elevator up to the office. Ichecked in with the receptionist and headed for the restroom for a bathroombreak. At least I had arrived early. I applied lipstick again and primped, readyto make a good appearance, hoping not to look as goofy as I felt. When Ireturned to the full waiting room, a white-haired man of about eighty looked atme with alarm.“Miss,” he said, “you have a hanger in your jacket.” All eyes turned.Confused, I thought he meant I had left a dry cleaning tag dangling. I reachedup and felt for the back of the jacket collar. Oh, no.It wasn’t a tag. The elderly man was right. A wooden clothes hanger poked fromunder my blazer. How could I have spent over an hour walking through New YorkCity wearing a jacket with a hanger still attached? My face went red. Thissignified a new low. I removed my jacket and placed the hanger on the officecoat rack. I tried to assume the demeanor of a normal person as I thanked theman and took my seat. But a sinking feeling came over me. What next? At least Iwouldn’t struggle to explain to the doctor what I meant by “brain fog.” I wouldjust describe my day so far.I didn’t know what to try next. My brain didn’t have the juice to figure out astrategy. Life decided for me."},{"pageContent":"Chapter Two [part0005.html#rch02]Things Worse Than Brain Fog [part0005.html#rch02]Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts.—Richard P. FeynmanI was diagnosed with breast cancer.After years of cystic breasts and countless needle biopsies that turned outbenign, the last one finally came up positive for cancer. Crap! Now I could notkeep impersonating a healthy person. I had to surrender to the fact that myhealth was out of control. All I could do was put one foot in front of theother. Somebody just had to tell me how and point me in the right direction.Surrendering wasn’t as easy as it sounded. Who exactly do I surrender to? Iremember hearing about enemy combatants during the Gulf War who wandered aroundthe desert for days looking for someone to surrender to. Surrender implies yourstruggles will end if you can just find the right person to give up to, noquestions asked. That was me.They Must Know What They Are DoingCancer … A life threatening disease. As in, you can die from that. Fear for yourlife can make you suspend all questioning and toddle behind the nearestauthority figure.images [../images/00001.jpeg]Fear can make you jump onto the first available treatment conveyor belt and plodthrough the steps assigned to you, no questions asked. Worse, fear can make youbelieve in the six most dangerous words in the English language: They must knowwhat they’re doing. Those six words sustained me for about a month.images [../images/00001.jpeg] Got cancer? Step one. Find a well-known doctor at a major Metropolitan hospital.Done. Dr. B. was smart, kind, personable, detail-oriented and open to my endlessquestions. You would think this partnership between patient and doctor wouldwork out great, right? Well, no and yes. My relationship with the famous surgeonworked out fine right up to the point when she lied to me … She then mislead me.To be fair, this arrangement wasn’t entirely her fault because it was her job topractice what they call “standard of care” medicine. She was professionallyrequired to follow “treatment guidelines” set up by a specific breast cancertreatment committee. But I didn’t know this information at the time. I didn’tknow the right questions to ask. I had zero context for even asking questions orhow to challenge the information she gave me. I had no idea what “survivalvalue” meant.That was the bad news.The good news: adrenaline cleared the brain fog, and my determination surged. Alight bulb went off. I realized that if the most charming, forthcoming surgeonin the world can legally deceive me, I better find another source of informationon breast cancer. My month of surrendering to the powers of a major metropolitanhospital was not as rewarding as I anticipated. I needed to get back in shapeand start digging. I needed to study up on how they make recommendations. Wheredo they get this stuff? Where do they keep the evidence? I needed to read up onthe official, so-called, “Breast Cancer Treatment Guidelines.”I no longer had my magic yellow shovel but I knew the principle was the same.Dig. Get the manual. Learn the rules of the game. Talk to anyone and everyone.An editor who mentored me once said, “Sometimes you just have to talk to peopleuntil they tell you to go away.” He also advised me to always carry a visiblenotebook and pen. Carrying a notebook makes people talk longer. Why is that?Maybe it gives the person you’re talking to the impression they haven’tfinished. From there on, brandishing my notebook became my best weapon againstcancer.It took me a lot of time and a lot of fact-checking, but I learned how thebreast cancer information industry works. I found kindred spirits, and weresearched together.images [../images/00001.jpeg]I learned how rare true information scrutiny was in the medical field. I alsolearned it is considered disrespectful, even treasonous, not to take anoncologist’s word for anything.images [../images/00001.jpeg]In many online breast cancer groups, members get upset when you question anyauthority’s position. When patients invest in that authority, they don’t want tosee their investment devalued or diminished by questioning.Credentials create a certain momentum of confidence that resists scrutiny.“Questioning behavior” is seen as resistance to authority, when in factauthorities should welcome the opportunity to display the authoritativeness oftheir learning if that learning is sound.The specific disease is the grand refuge of the weak, uncultured, unstableminds, such as now rule in the medical profession.—Florence Nightingale 1820–1910"},{"pageContent":"Chapter Three [part0005.html#rch03]Breast Cancer Research Leads to Iodine [part0005.html#rch03]Healing is a matter of time, but it is sometimes also a matter of opportunity.—HippocratesMost surgeons go along with the official Guidelines, thinking those doctors whowent before them must be paying attention and know what they were doing because,after all, they’re on the Guidelines Committee. Like the rest of us, doctorsalso have a tendency to believe those terrible six words about the medicalsystem: They must know what they’re doing. At a local cancer conference, I askeda question of the doctor who served as Director of Breast Cancer Services at oneof country’s major cancer hospitals.images [../images/00001.jpeg]“Does radiation therapy increase overall survival in breast cancer patients?”I asked this question because I had researched the medical literature andalready knew the answer, which was, No. I was testing him to see if hisinformation was reliable.His answer: “Radiation must increase survival because we do it at our hospital.”images [../images/00001.jpeg] I wanted to yell, Don’t you see the flawed logic in that answer? Whatever you domust be right because you do it? But I stood silent in the back of the audienceknowing I had just witnessed one of the most bizarre, arrogant moments inmedical history. And nobody screamed, not even me. We were too stunned.Thus, I began my mission as breast cancer information activist. I was not goingto keep the real evidence a secret. The evidence is available to everybodyonline in the National Library of Medicine. Medical information isn’t locked ina silver trunk anymore, where only the privileged few can access it. Is lookingup studies an alternative practice? Only if you consider locating and disclosingpeer review evidence subversive!I was trained never to share the deeper levels of my thinking with patients. Andwhen I took the Hippocratic Oath in 1989, I swore to keep my medical knowledgesecret. So until quite recently, becoming a knowledgeable, involved andmedically competent participant in one’s medical care was simply not permitted.And there is a good deal of physician resistance, resentment, and denial to theinescapable fact that the Internet is helping patients become better informed,more responsible, and more medically competent.—Alan Greene, MD, Clinical Professor of PediatricsStanford, E-patients White PaperBreast Cancer ChoicesI founded a nonprofit organization called Breast Cancer Choices, Inc. At ourwebsite, www.BreastCancerChoices.org [http://www.BreastCancerChoices.org], youcan see our organization specializes in scrutinizing the available informationabout breast cancer. Our mission contains three goals: disclosure, disclosure,disclosure. I didn’t become a breast cancer information activist because I hadtime on my hands. I had no choice. Doing my own detective work was the onlyother option, once my surrender strategy didn’t work out.I trained myself to scrutinize studies for breast cancer treatments andtherapies because I didn’t know any other way of getting the information. Mydoctors didn’t seem to be looking at the primary literature. When I asked myoncologist for the studies, she said she’d have to ask somebody where they were.images [../images/00001.jpeg]If she had actually read the primary literature, she would know that theevidence didn’t fit with the official Guidelines.images [../images/00001.jpeg] Oncologists and surgeons were too busy following the committee-generatedGuidelines to verify if they were evidence-based or not. All you need to do islook it up and you will see that in breast cancer, what they refer to asevidence-based medicine is not evidence based. It’s consensus-based. Bigdifference. Life-altering difference. Evidence-based medicine means survival wasextended within a group of studied people. Consensus–based medicine means abunch of doctors think a treatment is a good idea. Honest. Go ahead—do afact-check on this.Again, a physical setback in my life turned out to have a silver lining. Thistime it wasn’t breaking my big toe that saved me at a press conference; it wasbreast cancer, forcing me to dig deeper and not surrender to the status quo. Thethrill of uncovering hidden information is an emotion as powerful as any gatewaydrug. I was hooked and could not turn back.Digging into breast cancer research lead me to iodine. I didn’t think I couldever be more passionate about anything than I was about the dubious world ofcancer treatment. But then, one fall day, an accidental meeting changed allthat.Let me tell you how this scenario not only revived my obsession with the sea,but ignited a passion to spread the word about seaweed and iodine to whoeverwill listen.In 2005, Sherri Tenpenny, D.O., introduced herself to me at The American Collegefor the Advancement of Medicine (ACAM) conference and asked if I had heardanything about using iodine for the breast. I replied I was only aware of Ghentand Eskin’s work on iodine helping fibrocystic (benign) breast disease.Benign disease was, after all, a totally different condition than malignantdisease. Right?images [../images/00001.jpeg]I had been a breast cancer information activist for many years, going to all theconferences, networking with the most progressive doctors. Certainly if iodinewas good for breast cancer, I would have heard about it. Right?images [../images/00001.jpeg] Wrong, wrong, wrong!Only because I respected Dr. Tenpenny so much as a famous vaccine educator, didI consider her suggestion to investigate iodine more. When I returned home, IGoogled “iodine breast” and there were very few hits. So I searched the NationalLibrary of Medicine Database known as Pubmed. I found researchers in at leastfive countries had made major connections between breast tumors and iodinedeficiency. The research went back almost 50 years. I was humbled and confused.Still, the same arrogant phrase played in a loop in my head. I had studiedbreast cancer and every conceivable approach for more than a decade. I wouldhave heard about iodine if it had anything to do with breast cancer.I gave myself two weeks to read the full articles of the iodine research and seewhat I could discover. Then I had to locate some of the papers and books intheir bibliographies, so I budgeted another month of time to research. Thenanother month. I couldn’t understand how the link between iodine and breastdisease had been logged into The National Library of Medicine for 50 years andnever made it into sources I would know.Why didn’t the research scientists present their findings at medicalconferences? I was tempted to psychologize that perhaps scientists were shyerthan the rest of us, or they didn’t want to be accused by their peers ofoverstating the significance of their findings.I needed more intellectual confidence. I hadn’t yet heard of Dr. Guy Abraham …or, that there had been a virtual moratorium on iodine research for the last 50years. I was still reasoning like a conventional person and didn’t understandwhat Dr. David Brownstein calls the “Alice in Wonderland” part of contemporarymedicine.images [../images/00001.jpeg]As an independent scholar, I practice information investigation, not medicine.images [../images/00001.jpeg] I’ve discovered since, that not all research is online. You need to go out intothe real world. I began to dig up old pharmacy ledgers. I bid on old iodine“junk” at auctions; found 100 year-old veterinary pamphlets on putting iodine inlivestock feed; located a 1950s pamphlet on how to cure nymphomania byprescribing an anti-iodine drug.Now my office stands are piled with old iodine medical books stacked against thewalls. Research papers bulge from file cabinets. My iodine investigationexpanded far out from the official medical literature and into the disciplinesof geology, anthropology, neurology and archeology. This may be an unorthodoxway of doing research, but I didn’t have to account to the limitations of aconsensus-driven, peer-review committee, and I didn’t have a medical license tolose. As an independent scholar, I practice information investigation, notmedicine. So I could follow the iodine research wherever the investigation tookme and report the truth.Besides investigating medical and non-medical scholarship, I found I couldreconstruct the nineteenth and twentieth century iodine use by locating actualiodine artifacts through collectors selling antique medical items. In a layeffort at the forensic anthropology of iodine, Breast Cancer Choices managed tocollect a Civil War iodine canteen, iodine inhalation devices, various syphilisformulas, a 50 year-old iodine locket from the British Red Cross and ointmentsfor breast cysts, to name a few. We even located a can of iodine powder thatdates back to when Van Gogh raved to his brother how great iodine was forsyphilis! If Dr. Tenpenny had not sent me on the two week research project thatlasted eight years, I would not have ended up with an office that smells likemedicine. I wouldn’t have learned that iodine and seaweed can be documented asthe oldest traditional medicine or that a lost medical heirloom has finally beenfound.Launcher of the Iodine MovementIn 2005, I was still limited to reviewing the published medical literature. Dr.Guy Abraham, a retired professor of obstetrics, gynecology and endocrinology atUCLA School of Medicine, had published material challenging what is known as the“Wolff-Chaikoff Effect,” a relatively new (1961), but text book-accepted, theoryabout the “dangers of iodine.” One of his research partners, Dr. Jorge Flechas,was scheduled to speak on iodine at a conference in Los Angeles.Without hesitation, I crossed the country to hear him speak and to introducemyself. My colleagues from the cancer activist community also attended theiodine talk and were as intrigued as I was by his compelling information andbroad comprehension of iodine. Dr. Flechas’ presentation was voted the bestspeech at the conference by an informal poll done afterward. He distributeddetailed materials on Dr. Abraham’s Iodine Project and the new thinking aboutiodine. What an adventure! What a find!Visit Dr. Flechas’ website at http://cypress.he.net/[http://www.cypress.he.net/]. When I returned to the East Coast, I excitedlyreported the Abraham-Brownstein-Flechas Iodine Project information to my onlinebreast cancer group. What do you think happened? They responded the same way Idid when Dr. Tenpenny introduced iodine as a breast therapy to me a yearearlier.“Iodine?Iodine and breast cancer?Lynne, are you nuts?”So I engaged some research partners and we persevered. We began taking iodineourselves, first the traditional Lugol’s Iodine Solution which had been used forover 175 years, then a new product, a Lugol’s Iodine tablet called Iodoral. Istarted with one 12.5 mg tablet. I didn’t notice any change. After a few months,I decided to take the 24 hour urine Iodine Loading Test to measure my baselineiodine levels.The test procedure requires taking 50 mg of Iodoral in the morning and thencollecting urine for 24 hours to see how much of the 50 mg is absorbed and howmuch is excreted.images [../images/00001.jpeg]Within two hours of taking the 50 mg of Iodoral, I got a sensation some of uscall “the boing.” My brain cleared as if the dusty unused rooms of my brainsuddenly got oxygen. My thoughts grew sharper edges. I felt a burst of energy,thought faster and felt smarter even doing everyday math. I remember gettingimpatient with a store clerk because he couldn’t compute three times thirtytimes two in his mind. After several tries, he pulled out a calculator. Beforeiodine I wouldn’t have even noticed.images [../images/00001.jpeg] Some other iodine takers have reported this instant effect. Dr. William Shevinreported occasionally seeing this phenomenon in his own practice when he spokeat the first Iodine Conference in 2007. He said, “Those patients are so iodinedeficient, they are going on fumes.” Dr. Shevin also showed a video of a patientdescribing his new mental clarity on iodine supplementation. It was like toturning the dial of radio until you get the absolute clearest reception from achannel.Nobody can explain the physiology of the “boing” reaction with any certainty. Isit the thyroid? Neurologists trained in iodine deficiency would probably explainthe intellectual zap as entirely neurological. At this point, nobody knows!Bottom line: After I raised my Iodoral dosage, my brain not only snapped toattention, my weight normalized, my skin lost its lifelong dryness and severalmysterious cysts disappeared. My cold feet were now warm. I only get a headachenow if I stretch wrong. The orange Darvocet vial, my constant companion foryears, now rests in the local landfill.Other Iodine Leaders Appear and the Revolution IgnitesA small body of determined spirits fired by an unquenchable faith in theirmission can alter the course of history.—Mahatma GhandiSoon after, we at Breast Cancer Choices met Zoe Alexander, a retired professorwho started an online group to discuss iodine. The Yahoo Iodine Group (now ownedby Stephanie Buist, ND) got extremely busy. Zoe started another Yahoo onlinediscussion Group called the Iodine Research Group. When Zoe ran out of diskspace on Yahoo, she created a comprehensive, scholarly website,Iodine4Health.com [http://www.Iodine4Health.com], now revived asIodineResearch.com [http://www.IodineResearch.com] where she collected andorganized every iodine resource she could find. With the true spirit of grassroots innovation, the web site launched on an independent server created byfellow iodine advocates, Lynn Razaitis and Curt Smith.By the time The Yahoo Iodine Group reached 5,000 members in 2010, Stephanie hadearned her doctorate in Naturopathy and is acknowledged as one of the mostreliable and experienced sources of iodine information. The reputation of thegroup grew so that Stephanie needed to recruit four iodine-educatedco-moderators to help iodine beginners five days a week.The Curezone Iodine Forum, which continues to be lead by two of its threeoriginal founders, Laura “Wombat” Olsson and Steve “Trapper” Wilson, becamehugely active and well-respected as an experimental iodine users group.

The Curezoners wereinfected with the research bug acquired from the Dr. Abraham research.

The CurezoneIodine Forum logged over ten million hits, making it a testament to the power ofgrassroots medicine. Laura Olsson and Steve Wilson have become so knowledgeableabout iodine they have created their own unique and well-respected iodineproducts."},{"pageContent":"Chapter Four [part0005.html#rch04]Bromine—A Cause for Iodine Deficiency [part0005.html#rch04]Research is formalized curiosity. It is poking and prying with a purpose.—Zora Neale HustonWithin a few years, the success of the iodine users within the online groupswent viral. Thyroid and fibromyalgia groups took up the iodine cause. Motheringgroups tried it and reported success. Gradually more and more nutrition groupscould not argue with the success so many experienced. Meanwhile in the yearssince my accidental meeting with Dr. Tenpenny, I’ve dug deeper with my researchand uncovered an alarming pattern.images [../images/00001.jpeg]We’ve become iodine deficient since the 1970s because the anti-iodine brominehas purged iodine from our bodies!images [../images/00001.jpeg] Breast cancer rates have risen since the 1970s as iodine consumption decreasedand anti-iodine bromine exposure increased. I also looked at the Department ofDefense statistics on bromide exposure in Gulf War veterans. The bromismsymptoms seem to parallel other exposures, especially the ubiquitous brominatedfire retardants that we sleep on every night and sit on every day in furniture.I created a Powerpoint presentation titled The Perfect Storm Theory of BreastCancer (see Chapter 18 [part0029.html#RL0A0-93d4fd601e2c41969bad1e0d6c3e7ac4]:The Perfect Storm of Breast Cancer) which explores this phenomenon.It became clear that we aren’t just iodine deficient because we don’t eat enougheggs or seafood. We’ve become iodine deficient since the 1970s because theiodine-blocking element bromine has purged iodine from our bodies. The BromideDominance theory, explained in Appendix B[part0034.html#10DJ40-93d4fd601e2c41969bad1e0d6c3e7ac4] in The Iodine Crisis,may account for why more people are sick, IQs are dropping while thyroid andother diseases continue to worsen. Obesity may not have to do with overeating asmuch as a bromine-caused metabolic slow-down that causes weight gain.Bromine, the Evil “Holy Grail” of Iodine DeficiencyYes, the bromine-saturated environment can make you both fat and stupid.Below are six points targeting the dangers of our bromine-saturated environmentand the need for supplementing iodine as compensation. Consider these points acall to action. 1. Bromine fire retardant poisoning increases every year and takes yearsto reverse, making bromide the toxic equivalent to Global Warming. 2. Bromide pesticides and fire retardants will wind up being the new DDT,a pesticide banned in 1972, is still present in the breast tissue of women bornlater than that date. 3. If the underlying cause of thyroid, breast and other hormone-drivendiseases is iodine deficiency, then bromide dominance is the underlying cause ofthat deficiency. 4. Iodine is the biochemical “antidote” for toxic bromine but it takestime. Bromine is a persistent chemical bully. Like any bully, it has to beoutflanked, outnumbered and outwitted. The right dosage of iodine is your ally. 5. Bromine toxicity is too important to leave to the slow bureaucraticsystems of policy making. We have to teach ourselves and each other. 6. I share the goals of the Grass Roots Iodine Movement trailblazers.Let’s spread the iodine information far and wide, to our families, our neighborsand the world.image [../images/00003.jpeg]images [../images/00001.jpeg]Iodine Fast StatsThe term “Iodine” was Googled 1,220,000 times during the month of September,2012. • The World Health Organization cites iodine deficiency as the mostpreventable cause of mental retardation. Iodine deficiency doesn’t just occur inpoor countries. If babies are not born with profound intelligent defects, evenwith mild iodine deficiencies, many babies are significantly less smart thanthey could be.

[part0014.html#bqn1]Iodine is an essential micro-nutrient. This means it is needed in small amountsby every cell in the body. Iodine can be very powerful and our bodies have builtin compensation mechanisms to conserve it. That’s the good news.Then there is the bad news. Iodine deficiency has become a public health crisisbecause it’s so vulnerable to displacement by environmental toxins such asbromide, pesticides and food additives. That’s exactly what’s causing the iodinedeficiency. Bromine fire retardants surround us. Introduced in the 1970s, theyhave accumulated in our homes, cars and work places. Iodine as a food fortifierwas removed from flour around the same time, contributing to the iodinedeficiency that has grown to epidemic proportions.Is nutritional iodine the same as the iodine in the medicine cabinet?[part0014.html#bqn2]Tincture of Iodine is made with alcohol for use as a topical antiseptic. Thisalcohol form of iodine is not made for oral consumption and is usually markedwith a skull and cross bones signifying a poison. The main form of iodine usedfor the supplementation iodine we consume as a supplement is Lugol’s IodineSolution or Lugol’s in tablet form (Iodoral™). Other formulations aremanufactured but The Iodine Crisis speaks only to the Lugol’s formulation.Why has iodine become big news now? [part0014.html#bqn3]Because some brilliant doctors fact-checked the medical literature, then refutedthe recent myth that iodine supplementation was toxic. They went back in historyto when iodine was a universally used medicine and reported the information. Thedouble whammy came when tens of thousands of medical consumers triedsupplementing iodine and began reporting success stories on the Internet. TheGrass Roots Iodine Movement was born! Patient success, research andsupplementation reports continue to fuel interest in iodine.Is iodine a prescription item? [part0014.html#bqn4]Iodine is available as a nutritional supplement just as any vitamin or mineral.How was iodine used in the past? [part0014.html#bqn5]From medical records in 1906, iodine was considered The Universal Medicine” andused to treat:GoiterAtherosclerosisSyphilisUterine fibroidsMercury, lead and arsenic poisoningSwollen glandsProstatic hypertrophyScarlet feverBronchitis and pneumoniaObesityDepressionBreast painEczemaGenito-urinary diseasesMalariaOvarian cysts“Rheumatism”GastralgiaTonsilitisCoughimage [../images/00004.jpeg]As far back as 1899, the world’s best-selling medical textbook, the MerckManual, cited iodine as the most used substance for tumors. But Iodine’stherapeutic range goes much broader. In Chapter 14[part0025.html#NQU20-93d4fd601e2c41969bad1e0d6c3e7ac4]: The Buried History ofIodine, I explain how seaweed-based medicine and iodine goes back 15,000 years.But the “Golden Age of Iodine” spanned the last half of the 1800s and into thefirst half of the 1900s.Don’t I get enough iodine in iodized salt? [part0014.html#bqn6]The notion that refined iodized salt is sufficient is the most dangerousmisconception about iodine. From the time iodized salt leaves the factory untilit gets on grocery store shelves, half of the original iodide content is lost.Because once iodized salt is opened in your home, the iodine “sublimes” orescapes into the air in varying degrees, depending on humidity. After all that,when ingested, only 10 percent of the iodine in salt is absorbable. Then, afterall that, again, women should be concerned that the “iodine” in salt is actuallyiodide. Iodine is preferred by the breasts, thus a combination of iodine andiodide is generally used. Also, did I mention that cooking destroys iodine?Iodized Salt researchers, Dasgupta, et al, report on the problems of iodizedsalt in Iodine Nutrition: Iodine Content of Salt in the United States.Did I mention that common refined sodium chloride is devoid of any naturallyoccurring minerals contained in nutritious unrefined salt such as Celtic SeaSalt?So—short answer: No, you can’t get enough iodine from iodized salt because youcan’t be sure if you’re actually getting iodine—how much or what kind. The“Iodized Salt Scam” is discussed in Chapter 8[part0018.html#H5A40-93d4fd601e2c41969bad1e0d6c3e7ac4]. How Often Should I TakeIodine?, When ingested, only 10 percent of the iodine in salt is absorbable.I eat a lot of fish so I probably don’t need iodine, right? [part0014.html#bqn7]If you eat four pounds of ocean fish every day, bon appetit! Most iodineliterate practitioners would say you probably don’t have to worry about iodine,just the mercury in four pounds of fish.Is iodine safe to supplement? [part0014.html#bqn8]Iodine is safe when the right product is taken as directed under the supervisionof an Iodine Literate Practitioner.If iodine has been around so long, why aren’t people using it medically anymore?[part0014.html#bqn9]When patent antibiotics such as penicillin came into use after World War II,Iodine was considered “old-fashioned,” a cardinal sin in the medical community.Gradually, its traditional properties, other than use as an antiseptic becamevirtually unknown. But the fatal blow came when an influential medical papermistakenly claimed iodine was dangerous. A moratorium on iodine use began andiodine’s use and its benefits gradually disappeared except for antisepticpurposes. The mistake in one influential paper purged the benefits of iodine fortwo generations of Medical School students. The effect of this research paper isdiscussed in detail in the Chapters 16[part0027.html#PNV60-93d4fd601e2c41969bad1e0d6c3e7ac4], Who Stole Iodine from myMedicine? and Chapter 17 [part0028.html#QMFO0-93d4fd601e2c41969bad1e0d6c3e7ac4],Who Stole Iodine from my Food?What is iodine deficiency? [part0014.html#bqn10]There are various technical definitions of iodine “deficiency” and “sufficiency”and much disagreement among health professionals. An Iodine LiteratePractitioner would describe a patient as iodine deficient based on a combinationof symptoms and/or the Iodine Loading Test.But isn’t the iodine RDA for adults 150 mcg which I get in my multivitamin?[part0014.html#bqn11]The RDA appears to be calculated from how much iodine the thyroid needs to avoidgoiter. The requirements of the other organs aren’t factored into the number.Additionally, the effect of iodine-blocking polluters was never considered when150 mcg was established.What are the iodine deficiency symptoms? [part0014.html#bqn12]Often we don’t know which symptoms are iodine deficiency-related until theydisappear after taking iodine. Veteran iodine takers report they feel increasingimprovement as the months and years go on. Conditions such as psoriasis,coldness and even testicular cysts have disappeared in people using iodine forother reasons.Originally, we thought iodine must be helping the thyroid because that was themain gland known for storing iodine. Since then, if someone’s hearing improves,for example, we think iodine is helping the neurological system. Since everycell in the body contains iodine, we can’t know the mechanism of action. Theonly way to define what makes an iodine deficiency is by listing what symptomsiodine has benefited.In developing countries, iodine deficiency is the leading cause of goiter andmental retardation. In my own experience as well as the experience of many otheriodine-takers, even the average person experiences a boost in perception and theability to make calculations.A partial list of conditions we’ve seen that are helped by iodine:AllergiesBrain fogDry skinCysts and nodulesFatigueThyroid problemsOvarian problemsCognitive problems (unclear thinking)Menstrual irregularitiesWeight gainBreast pain/ fibrocystic breast diseaseFeeling coldGum infectionPsoriasisType 2 DiabetesHair thinningPuffy faceFertility problemsDepressionHeart arrhythmiaBlood pressureCholesterolScarsInfectionsGenital HerpesMiscarriageFibromyalgiaHearing lossProstate diseaseLung conditionsConstipationFertility (in women)Vaginal infectionsEye problemsNeck painGERDExcemaResistance to colds and virusIncreased sex driveIncreased erections and semen when applied to the testiclesCan I get enough iodine from dried seaweed or seaweed supplement products?[part0014.html#bqn13] 1.There’s a danger that the seaweed may have picked up arsenic, heavymetals, oil spill dispersants, radiation or other contaminants from ournow-polluted seawater. Also, you never know how much iodine you’re getting insuch items as kelp tablets or what the ingredients used as tablet filler andbinders do. Seaweed loses much of its iodine content after harvesting, so afterbeing reprocessed into tablets, and stockpiled in a warehouse for months, do youreally know what you’re taking? 2.The Fukushima Japanese nuclear reactor explosion seems to havecontaminated much of the world’s seaweed. This nuclear contamination has beenvirtually ignored outside Japan. Although, according to The Maritime Executivepublication, The Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safetyreported that the Fukushima disaster produced the world’s worst nuclear seapollution. Also, we’ve almost forgotten about the oil spills in the US Gulf thathave migrated far out and the dispersants used to dissolve the oil presentadditional sea life contamination problems. We don’t know how long crops ofseaweed remain contaminated.How do I know if I’m iodine deficient? [part0014.html#bqn14]The most definitive way to diagnose iodine deficiency is to be evaluated by anIodine Literate Practitioner. The results of taking the Iodine Loading Test isused to get a baseline to determine how much iodine is saturated in the tissues.What makes an Iodine Literate Practitioner? [part0014.html#bqn15]Breast Cancer Choices and the major iodine patient-to-patient online groupscustomarily define an Iodine Literate Practitioner as someone who has read allthe writings of the Iodine Project initiated by A. Guy Abraham, MD, DavidBrownstein, MD, and Jorge Flechas, MD.Additionally, an Iodine Literate Practitioner is conversant with the book,Iodine: Why You Need It: Why You Can’t Live Without It, fourth edition, by DavidBrownstein, MD. These works explain the comprehensive context of iodine therapyand how the 50 mg dose was arrived at. An Iodine Literate Practitioner will befamiliar with the necessity of the companion nutrients and will never recommendseaweed as a substitute for iodine.If a practitioner routinely prescribes for adults, an amount of iodine under 50mg; does not know why each of the companion nutrients is used (includingselenium for Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis); is unfamiliar with salt loading,auto-immune disease treatment or interpreting the idiosyncrasies of iodinepatient TSH test reports; then Breast Cancer Choices does not recommend them asiodine literate. Many doctors claim they are iodine literate but recommend kelpor very weak iodine products. Check with the patient-to-patient iodine groupsonline to make sure you are using a time-tested product or ask an experiencedpractitioner.Please check the website www.BreastCancerChoices.org/IPractitioners[http://www.BreastCancerChoices.org/IPractitioners] which is updated frequently.The website does not include every practitioner using iodine since moreprescribe iodine every day.I heard there is a quick “patch test” to see if you are iodine deficient. Whatis that test and how accurate is it? [part0014.html#bqn16]The so-called iodine patch test refers to painting a two inch square of tinctureof iodine or Lugol’s Iodine on the body and watching to see how long the orangesquare takes to fade. Theoretically, the quicker the orange fades, the hungrieryour body is for iodine. However, so many variables exist in human skin, thatthe test cannot be considered reliable or conclusive.Additionally: 1. The body may be dehydrated on that day. 2. The skin may be more or less iodine deficient than, say, the ovaries. 3. The gold standard in the Iodine Movement is to assess iodinedeficiency with the 24 hour Iodine Loading Test.Where do I get the Iodine Loading Test? [part0014.html#bqn17]Ask your doctor for a lab she prefers or look in The Iodine Loading Test sectionin Part 4 [part0031.html#TI1E0-93d4fd601e2c41969bad1e0d6c3e7ac4], Resources, ofthis book. Patients can order this test without a prescription.Do vegetarians need iodine? [part0014.html#bqn18]Yes, especially if they are not eating seaweed five times per day or in thequantities the average resident of Japan consumes. As mentioned earlier, eatingseaweeds is a risky way to consume iodine, and it loses iodine rapidly afterharvesting.Can everybody take iodine? [part0014.html#bqn19]In seven years, I’ve only met a handful people who said they could not tolerateiodine. Some gave up quickly after getting a rash, brain fog or fatigue and didnot do the salt loading protocol. Others have experienced other problems and arestill working to resolve those issues. And still others swear iodine doesn’tagree with them. Iodine is necessary to stay alive and is already in the tissueof every human being, so the people who can’t tolerate iodine need anexperienced practitioner to investigate why supplementation is causing problems.If you are allergic to the iodine contrast dyes in scans, are you allergic toiodine? [part0014.html#bqn20]The radioactive iodine in medical scans is an entirely different substance fromthe iodine in iodine supplements. The Iodine doctors have reported that only ifyou are allergic to iodized salt will you be allergic to iodine.I’m allergic to shellfish. Can I take iodine? [part0014.html#bqn21]Most people who are allergic to shellfish can take iodine supplements. Shellfishcontains a protein which is a common allergen. Again, the Iodine LiteratePractitioners find that only people allergic to iodized salt may be allergic toiodine supplementation.Is iodine just another thing that’s “good for me?” It sounds too good to betrue. [part0014.html#bqn22]Iodine is a universal nutrient in that it regulates hormones and metabolism,enhances brain development and function as well as detoxifies toxic halogens andheavy metals. Iodine works as an “adaptogen,” that is, it helps strengthen thebody’s ability to adapt to and compensate for physical disruptions.If you think iodine is just another nutrient, read the diverse success storiesin this book and decide for yourself.images [../images/00001.jpeg]Iodine Success StoriesThe iodine success stories reported throughout this book established anunexpected milestone in my iodine journey. Over the years, people had emailed metheir successes and thanked me for publishing the iodine information on thewebsite. Many other success stories were recorded by the Curezone Forum andYahoo Iodine Group. But I had never asked for stories until the final stages ofwriting this book. I only expected to document a record of iodine supplementers.But something intensely powerful happened. When I sent out three emails todifferent groups, people opened up their hearts to me and shared their strugglesand successes. It changed many lives, from allergies, to debilitating fatigue,to being able to get out of bed and go to work. Others found iodine stoppedhorrible menstrual problems. Still others found their prostates became healthyand their libidos returned. The generous outpouring of those who have sufferedmoved me in ways I’m still trying to process. I thank them all.I discovered that people who have recovered from many years of stoicism want totell their stories. They want to offer their experience in the chance thatsomeone else will benefit as much as they did. Many of us sound like evangelistsbecause the course of our lives was transformed. Iodine is not a panacea, but ithas mysteriously and powerfully altered who we are as individuals and familymembers. We want to do something with the good fortune we have received. We wantto “pay it forward” as the saying goes.Meet Kim: Her sense of well-being returned, and her hair loss stopped.Iodine changed my life.I was searching for “perfect health” and the answer was iodine. I started takingiodine in April, 2011. At the time, I didn’t know about Iodoral so I found acompounding pharmacy willing to make Lugol’s iodine for me. I had iodine-relatedbromide symptoms right away on one drop. At the time I had joined a learn-to-rungroup, and I remember the symptoms showing strongly when I tried to run. My nosedripped, I couldn’t run very far without being exhausted, and I was depressedand having dark thoughts.I tend to be quite brave about plowing through detox symptoms. I understandnatural healing and what occurs, so despite the anxiety, depression and darkthoughts, I kept going. I did a lot of salt loading that helped immensely. Myurine had a strange smell.I had a lot of clashes with my mother. I feel badly about it now but healingtakes place from the head down. I obviously had some suppressed anger and shewas the one I took it out on.I gave up using conventional deodorant and switched to a natural one. Always“needing” deodorant, when I switched, I went through a time period of heavy bodyodor. I remember one day a friend looking at me, wondering why I smelled so bad.I wish I had said, “Oh sorry, I know I stink, I am detoxing,” but I didn’t. I amthrilled to say, that period has passed and I barely need deodorant now.Seriously! I hardly need it!From the very beginning, my thyroid felt swollen and I was always looking in themirror to see if it looked strange. I don’t think it did but I was definitelyworried. The muscles around my jaw and my shoulders felt tight. I was grindingmy teeth. My skin took on a white, translucent look and my nails shone! Today Iget complimented often on my “nice tan” even though I haven’t been in the sun. Ido wonder if the iodine has made my skin a little darker.As the year progressed, I kept taking a little more and a little more iodine. Ifound out about Iodoral, and I found it so much easier than the drops. My hair,which had fallen out all my adult life, stopped falling out. I even think mygrey hair took on a tinge of colour again.There were two things I noticed that I am not sure if they were always there, orI just came out of my brain fog and finally noticed them; my tongue was sore andI had quite a few cherry angiomas.By February, I was able to take four Iodoral (50 mg) without too much trouble.This for me was a miracle. It was a long road to “no detox symptoms” for me. Oneof the most amazing things was that the chiropractor I had been seeing for yearsstarted to say “You are in really good shape.” My general aches and pains haddefinitely disappeared.At this time, however, I really did feel that my detox pathways (liver, kidneys)had had enough and needed a break. I did gain weight. I was also reading whatDr. Brownstein and Dr. Abraham were saying about lowering the dose after a year.I have two things to say about this time. One was that at the back of my mind, Ithought maybe I should go to a higher dose, and two, instead of doing what wasadvised and lowering the dose to 12.5, I stopped altogether. I can’t comment onwhat I should have done. This was my journey.I took some time to see an acupuncturist to help with my detox pathways, and atthis time, I started feeling “spiritual.” I have delved deeper into this and Inow meditate daily. The iodine had opened my “third eye” but it took stoppingthe iodine for me to see that.I stopped until recently but started back at 50mg of iodine a day with notrouble at all. I have even tried raising the dose to 100mg on and off.It is my desire to tell others about iodine. I am grateful for this opportunity.I believe that it is a great healer and has the potential to bring joy back intopeople’s lives. Be strong on your journey, you CAN heal.Meet Marty: Crippling fatigue, depression and a worsening spiral begin toresolve.Greetings, I am a 31 year old male who has been on Lugol’s 2% iodine for thepast 33 days.For most of my life I have had trouble with fatigue and brain fog, but, inhindsight, the signs were obvious because of puberty, It was at that point Ideveloped gynecomastia (breast tissue), bad scalp problems (bloody scabs fromthe itching), emotionality/neurotic behavior, poor lower jaw development, poorbeard development and much more.I’ve been labeled with many different learning and cognitive disabilities byschools and have been called lazy since around age 14 when the fatigue startedto get bad. My hair started to fall out at 17, then started to slowly turn whiteby 21, very noticeable by 25. I have never lived on my own as the fatigue hasalways crushed any attempts to pursue a serious goal. Since age 17, I’ve been onmany dreaded SSRI [antidepressant] cycles doctors prescribe as a band-aid todeeper, more fundamental issues.About a year ago, after researching something unrelated, it occurred to me thatI had some sort of hormone problem which I suspected was hypogonadism rooted ineither not enough native testosterone production, or too much phytoestrogensdisrupting normal endocrine function. Without health insurance or income, therewas no choice but to explore options other than drugs. So I tried many thingssuch as DHEA, and antioxidants such as grape seed extract and indole 3 carbinole(I3C).Nothing seemed to have an effect on the crippling fatigue, but then I cameacross the symptoms of hypothyroidism in a book my mother had. It was likereading a personal biography, a notion reinforced when I then started toresearch personal testimonials online. I came across the idea of taking iodineafter reading some articles, on Lugol’s 2% and 5%. There were many positivetestimonials there, so I went for it.The first week I was sick a lot, headaches and fatigue, dark thoughts and such.Only later I learned that salt water and the companion nutrients would havehelped that. Fortunately, my mother had all kinds of vitamin C and magnesiumtablets, and I had already been on a multi-vitamin for several months. I startedwith12.5 mg of iodine and was up to 50 by the first week. I stayed on 50 mg fora solid 10 days before trying 75 mg, and the increase in energy was quitenoticeable.About a week ago, I started consuming Celtic sea salt and so far it looks like Iam gradually getting better. Last week I helped a family member with someconstruction type work for a good three hours, which is the first time I’ve beencompelled to labor like that for many years. I came back a few days later andhelped for three straight days about four hours each, which would have been outof the question just a week or two prior.There is still some fatigue during the day, especially after I eat, but actuallyfalling asleep from it is becoming increasingly rare. In fact, there were signsof progress even in the first week, as the bloody scabs on my crown went awaythough there is still some flaking, and the hair shedding has significantlyreduced. Today I’ll be taking 125 mg to see if the progress continues.As I said, I have tried many things with depressing results. This is the firsttime I have noticed any considerable change. I am hopeful (desperate) that thisiodine protocol is the first step in turning things around for my health, andmaybe soon I will have the strength to work and not have the constant reminderof how emasculating it is not to be independent.Meet Betty: Diabetes and related stomach problem resolve.I only started using Lugol’s because I had stomach and intestinal bacterialovergrowth (Gastroparesis, a common occurrence with Diabetics where the stomachtakes 15 to 20 hours to empty). This causes many symptoms. Lugol’s worked verywell and took care of the symptoms, and the BONUS was that I no longer need totake my diabetes pills. I’ve been off them for two weeks now (in 13 years), andmy blood sugars are staying within normal levels which didn’t happen even WHILEI was taking them. I am very happy, and I want everyone to KNOW what iodine hasdone for me. I can’t tell enough people.Nice that I can get complacent, huh? One in seven American women will bediagnosed with breast cancer. I’m sure that I will not. I have experiencediodine and companion nutrients dissolving fibrous tissue.Too bad I didn’t know about this five years ago, when my sister-in-law died ofbreast cancer. She left five children behind.images [../images/00001.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"Chapter Six [part0005.html#rch06]FAQ 2Why Consider Supplementing Iodine? [part0005.html#rch06]Is Iodine a magic bullet? [part0014.html#bqn23]Iodine is not something that’s just “good for you.” The effect lies in itsprofound power to detox, normalize and nourish the cells so they can workoptimally. From an evolutionary perspective, Dr. Sebastiano Venturi suggeststhat iodine in the form of seaweed was probably the first anti-oxidant. Iodineis more of a missing link that helps the body regulate and adapt. That’s whyit’s called “the universal nutrient.” But no one should consider iodine acure-all for anything.What dosage of iodine is right for me? [part0014.html#bqn24]Most people determine their dosage by trial and error and with the support oftheir Iodine Literate Practitioner or with the support of the online IodineGroups. See The Iodine Supplementation Protocol, in Part 4[part0031.html#TI1E0-93d4fd601e2c41969bad1e0d6c3e7ac4], Resources.Which kind of Iodine is the best to take? [part0014.html#bqn25]My family and friends prefer Iodoral, a form of Lugol’s Solution compounded intablet form to protect the stomach. A single 12.5 mg Iodoral tablet contains twodifferent kinds of iodine: 5 mg iodine and 7.5 mg potassium iodide. We also keepa bottle of Lugol’s Iodine in the car and in the medicine chest for first aid ordigestive problems.Others prefer the original Lugol’s Solution, SSKI, Magnascent or other forms.It’s helpful to ask members of the online iodine forums why they prefer one overthe other. You will find some iodine “gourmets” out there who combine differentiodine formulations.Since I can only vouch for Iodoral and Lugol’s Iodine Solution as effective frompersonal experience, I can’t knowledgeably recommend other formulations.However, I would be hesitant to buy any iodine “formulations” which combinetyrosine or selenium in the same tablet. Many products have sprung up to meetthe demand of iodine-savvy consumers. Unfortunately, not all of these productsare based on a broad knowledge of iodine metabolism.How many milligrams of iodine do Lugol’s Solution drops contain? How does thatcompare to Iodoral? [part0014.html#bqn26]2 drops of Lugol’s 5% Solution contain the equivalent of one tablet of Iodoral12.5 mg. See the Lugol’s Iodine Solution Chart in the Resources section of thisbook.Is there a consensus on dosing iodine? [part0014.html#bqn27]Ask your Iodine Literate Practitioner. The usual goal for adults is to startwith 12.5 mg and work up to 50 mg or more if a medical condition is at issue.The experience of many iodine takers has shown that building up the dosegradually helps reduce side effects. It may take some time to find the rightdosage. Most people find contacting the online Iodine Groups helpful.Patient-to-patient experts with years of experience will provide information.Do I take iodine all at once or spread the dosage out through the day?[part0014.html#bqn28]Most people prefer to take iodine in the morning because of the possibility ofiodine causing wakefulness at bedtime. Others spread it out during the day.If iodine is so good at killing bacteria, won’t it kill off the beneficialbacteria in my gut? [part0014.html#bqn29]Iodine killing off gut bacteria has never been reported. Some scientists thinkthe original source of iodine from seaweed makes it protective as one of theoriginal antioxidants from an evolutionary point of view.Can I consume Tincture of Iodine instead? [part0014.html#bqn30]No. Absolutely not! Tincture of Iodine is considered toxic if taken by mouth.Can I consume Betadine? [part0014.html#bqn31]No. Absolutely not! Betadine iodine is considered toxic if taken by mouth.Can I consume Povidone? [part0014.html#bqn32]No. Absolutely not! Povidone iodine is considered toxic if taken by mouth.I don’t have a thyroid. Does my body need iodine? [part0014.html#bqn33]Yes. Every cell in the body requires iodine to function, everybody needs iodine.Where can I buy iodine supplements? [part0014.html#bqn34]Shop around on the Internet. All the major vitamin companies carry Iodoral.Always buy from a seller who has a long term relationship with the manufacturerso you get the true product, not a counterfeit, or Iodoral which has passed itsexpiration date.Full disclosure: the charity I work for, Breast Cancer Choices, sells Iodoral asour charity fundraiser. Many people buy from us because as a nonprofit we cansell iodine cheaply, and the ten percent we make on sales goes to a good cause.I do not personally profit from any iodine product.I’ve heard cabbage and the cruciferous vegetables cancel out iodine. Is thattrue? [part0014.html#bqn35]As long as you’re taking iodine, the goitrogenic (iodine blocking) vegetableswill not suppress your thyroid or block iodine uptake. If you’re not takingiodine, taking raw cruciferous vegetables or supplements made from thesevegetables may block absorption of iodine to the thyroid. Unfortunately, somebreast cancer patients have been known to take broccoli-based supplementswithout iodine, not understanding the consequences of blocking iodine.What is Magnascent Iodine? Will it work as well as Lugol’s or Iodoral?[part0014.html#bqn36]Magnascent is a magnetized formulation that is usually used in addition tostronger forms of iodine/iodide. Magnascent was reportedly the formula used byEdgar Cayce. Some people report benefits from Magnascent, but if a person isseriously ill, no Iodine Literate Practitioner would recommend Magnascent as astandalone therapy.Does decolorized (white iodine) work as well as Lugol’s Iodine?[part0014.html#bqn37]Decolorized iodine only contains potassium iodide. Lugol’s and Iodoral containboth potassium iodide and elemental iodine. Patients with breast cysts havereported decolorized iodine does not work as well as Lugol’s Iodine when usedtopically (on the skin).I take thyroid medicine. Will iodine counteract that? [part0014.html#bqn38]According to the iodine practitioners, no one has complained that iodine affectsthyroid medication. The opposite has been reported. Iodine can be a missing linkto make thyroid work better.I spilled Lugol’s Iodine on my kitchen counter. Is the stain permanent?[part0014.html#bqn39]No. Usually making a thick paste of vitamin C powder and water will removeiodine stains. One of our Breast Cancer Think Tank members reports she removed astain from her white bathroom rug by soaking the spot with Vitamin C paste, thenletting it soak and sit.What if a person has an auto immune thyroid disease such as Hashimoto’s?[part0014.html#bqn40]Originally, practitioners thought there might be a problem with Hashimoto’spatients taking iodine. Now we’ve found that so-called problem is a mythperpetrated by those promoting an incomplete iodine protocol. After much studyby the experienced iodine practitioners, it has become clear that iodinedeficiency is often the most direct cause of Hashimoto’s combined with seleniumdeficiency. Contact an Iodine Literate Practitioner who is experienced in usingiodine for auto immune diseases. If your practitioner has not trained under thesupervision of one of the major iodine doctors, he or she may not know theadditional protocols for auto-immune disease, including the necessity of theright amount of selenium.

[part0014.html#bqn41]Boys and girls seem to require the same amount of iodine until they reachpuberty. As the breasts and ovaries begin to develop, the iodine requirementgoes up for the girls. The increased requirements can take iodine away from thethyroid at this time. Goiter researcher, Dr. David Marine, found that Ohio girlsand boys experienced equal amounts of thyroid disease until the girls reachedpuberty when significantly more girls developed goiter. This discovery finallyresulted in the iodization of salt in 1924.Why do the breasts need iodine? [part0014.html#bqn42]There are many iodine receptors in the breast to keep the milk ducts and othertissue performing optimally. Iodine has been observed to detoxify fluids in thebreasts and eliminate cysts which harbor toxins.What does iodine deficiency have to do with the breast? [part0014.html#bqn43]In animals, blocking dietary iodine will cause the breasts to swell, developnodules, fibrous tissue and cysts in a way that parallels the progressivedevelopment of breast disease in women. When iodine is supplied, the fibrocysticdisease goes away. When iodine is blocked again, the breast disease returns.Do nursing women need more iodine? [part0014.html#bqn44]In nursing mothers, the body will take iodine from the thyroid if necessary inorder to make sure the baby gets enough. It’s one reason some women hold ontopost-baby weight. Less iodine going to their thyroids and more to the baby viathe breast could slow down metabolism.images [../images/00001.jpeg]Iodine StoriesMeet, Lee: Her sleepiness, lumpy breasts, menstrual problems, thyroid disorder,depression … all gone!I’m a 47–year-old mother of four. I suffered for a couple decades withhypothyroidism and each time I went for my annual checkup, I would report thesame: chronic sleepiness, brain fog, and increasing symptoms of estrogendominance such as achy, lumpy breasts, and excessive menstrual bleeding. Hewould check my TSH only and send me on my way with a new anti-depressant andlarger and larger amounts of Synthroid. I felt like what he gave me just wasn’thelping and was never quite satisfied with his explanation of why he would notprescribe Armour or other glandular therapy.I never went back and have been off all Synthroid for over a year. I went on thenet to look for a new doctor but couldn’t find one that took our insurance andwould prescribe Armour. Then I found the Yahoo Iodine Group. The more I read,the more it became clear how I must be deficient in iodine, so I ordered someand started at the basic 12.5 mg dose of Iodoral.After some mild detox symptoms, and starting the supplements and salt loading, Iwas feeling pretty good and decided to do the salt water detox protocol since Ihad many symptoms of bromide dominance. I have been on 50 mg for about a month.I am also taking over–the-counter thyroid glandular supplements. Let me say thatI do not choose to be doing so on my own without a doctor’s consult andapproval, but I have found no other option.The upside to my beginning the iodine protocol is that it has drasticallychanged my health for the better. I am now able to sweat for the first time. Mybasal temps are only a degree under normal now. My skin is much improved.I am not bleeding as much during menstruation. Last time my period snuck up onme without any PMS or achy breasts. I am not craving sweets all the time andhave lost 15 lbs. as I’m able to stick to a healthier diet. I would say the mostprofound change is the way my breasts have changed. They are smooth, soft, andnot lumpy or achy anymore. I would describe it as “comfortable breasts.” I canactually walk around without a bra and not hurt. I guess this is what it’s liketo feel “normal.” I was probably on my way to breast cancer while I was in thatcondition.I wanted to say “Thank You” to all of you at BreastCancerChoices.org[http://www.BreastCancerChoices.org] for maintaining a site that discusses thedetoxification protocol. I sure tried my best to find a doctor to help me getbetter, but, in lieu of that, I finally took charge of my own health. I willtell everyone I know to read the information about iodine. I know a lot offriends and relatives on Synthroid who are not even taking any iodine. If theyare convinced, I will send them to your site.You can share this testimonial with anyone you like and use my name also. Thanksagain for saving my life!Meet Ed: His “age-related hearing loss” drastically improves.When I was 72, I was scheduled to be fitted with a hearing aid. A few daysbefore my appointment, the hearing aid fitter called the house and needed toreschedule in five weeks because he was going into the hospital for anoperation. Meanwhile, I had been taking 25 mg Iodoral and complained to my wifethat I didn’t notice anything. She said, so take another tablet. Before thehearing aid guy got back to work, my hearing loss disappeared so I cancelled theappointment and saved myself several thousand dollars.Meet Gina from Norway: Many problems resolved from fibrocystic breasts topalpitations to candida.I am not alone anymore! Thank you; I have learned a lot. I started on Iodine oneyear ago. Ailments: long time candida, Wilson’s temperature syndrome, dry skin,FBD and so on. No doc involved; only my own research and experimental nature.I started slow; didn’t raise my dose to 50 mg until 6 months ago. Then thedetox-thing kicked in; and more so when I upped my vitamin C from 1g to 6 to7g(bowel tolerance).First noticeable changes after iodine: Nails stopped splitting in layers, skin improved. Heart palpitationsgone. Temperature went up from average 36,5C to 37 C (98,7F)!!! Allergysymptoms improved 70% (sneezing, sinus problems) Fibrocystic breasts disease reduced by 90% when I raised to 50 mg. Candida gone 90 %. I can live with the rest; it is under my control now! Sun tolerance is 100% better; combined iodine and coconut oil is thebest; no more burning for the sun-lover (I live in Norway and need it) I also supplement with selenium, magnesium, pink salt, etc. Other useful supplements: Turmeric + enzymes; helps allergy symptoms, less sneezing + betterdigestion. Borax; helps fungus related ailments/candida; combined with iodine.Meet Don: Blood pressure, cholesterol and heart rate all normalized.I have been using Lugol’s, 240 mgs daily for about six months, my blood pressureand cholesterol have gotten into the normal range, my cholesterol was 220, nowit is 180, my HDL has gone to 40, better than 35 before, my blood pressure was150 over 90, I was on a low dosage of blood pressure meds to also slow my heartrate down, iodine seems to have fixed all three.Meet Mary: 50 mg Iodine prevent genital herpes outbreaks, breast lumps,allergies, fatigue.I’m excited to tell you that so long as I take 50 mg/day of Iodoral, I don’texperience the genital herpes condition which has plagued me for many, manyyears. It hasn’t been cured, but it’s under control. I know this because I’veonly had herpes once since I started the Iodine Protocol nine months ago. Thatwas when I tried after five months to reduce my dose to 37.5mg, I suffered aherpes breakout which resolved immediately when I brought my dosage back to 50mgof Iodoral.Of course, this isn’t the only benefit I’ve experienced since starting theIodine Protocol, but it’s probably the most exciting for me. I’m sure otherswill tell you of no more lumpy breasts and allergies and endless energy. I evengive three drops of Lugol’s 2% a day to my dogs!images [../images/00001.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"Chapter Seven [part0005.html#rch07]FAQ 3What Do Doctors Think About Iodine? [part0005.html#rch07]What do most doctors think of iodine? [part0014.html#bqn45]Most contemporary doctors were taught in medical school that iodine should befeared and could damage the thyroid. This fear (which Dr. Guy Abraham refers toas Iodophobia!) was the result of a policy change based on a study that provedmistaken and misleading. Fifty years ago, iodine was widely used for everythingfrom ovarian cysts to hemorrhoids. Now the iodine information is gettingexposure as patients report benefits back to their doctors.My doctor says, “It’s a fundamental law of physiology that iodine shuts down thethyroid.” [part0014.html#bqn46]That’s what she was taught in medical school. Physiology is an ever-involvingtheoretical discipline of medicine. What your doctor learned about iodine as afundamental, unquestioned law of physiology in medical school has turned out,(1) not to be fundamental, (2) not to be a law, and (3) completely refuted. Tensof thousands of iodine users have challenged the “law” by taking iodine insignificant milligram dosages to great benefit.Be patient with your doctor. It takes years for the medical profession to catchup with new information. You may remember how long it took for Doctors BarryMarshall and Robin Warren to convince the medical profession that peptic ulcerswere caused not from psychological causes but by a specific bacterium. Theyfinally received the Nobel Prize in 2005. A lot of us are hoping Dr. Guy Abrahamwill be recognized in the same way.I wanted to try iodine but my doctor said it was just an Internet fad.[part0014.html#bqn47]Does he mean that the thousands of people have discovered something that madethem feel better should be disregarded because they discovered it on theinternet? If iodine supplementation were a fad, it wouldn’t have been usedcontinuously from the 1820s to the 1940s.Why doesn’t my doctor know about iodine? [part0014.html#bqn48] 1. Because he or she has not attended Integrative Medicine conferences. 2. Because iodine is so cheap, can’t be patented, requires noprescription and thus no drug company sales rep has come to the doctor’s officepushing it. 3. Because he or she still believes the debunked Wolff-Chaikoffconclusion, claiming iodine will damage the thyroid, is accurate.But Iodine literacy is spreading fast. At the November 2010 ACAM (AmericanCollege for the Advancement of Medicine) conference, integrative medicineexpert, Michael Schachter, MD, asked the audience doctors how many of them usediodine in their practices. Half of the audience members raised their hands.Great progress!Has the information about iodine been presented at any medical conferences?[part0014.html#bqn49]Yes. To name a few: The ACAM Conferences, The Anti-Aging Conferences, TheWeston. A. Price Conference, The Iodine Conferences and others.Are there are any medical studies I can show my doctor? [part0014.html#bqn50]It would depend on what your goals as a patient are. You may have to researchyour particular concern and bring it to the attention of the patient-to-patientexperts in the online iodine community.Where can I find an Iodine Literate Practitioner?

I was very resistant to taking the Tamoxifen. Finally, Ibought the prescription and took it home. My husband really wanted me to do whatthe doctor said. So I did try the Tamoxifen for about a week. It caused a toxicproblem for me. It created what is known as Tamoxifen-induced asthma.I was staying at a quaint and peaceful mountain cabin at the time. We were doingday hikes. I scared the bejesus out of my husband when I began having troublebreathing on one of our hikes. He and I thought I was going to die right thenand there. I had no idea that Tamoxifen could cause something like that.But by Googling Tamoxifen and asthma, I found that research was done thatidentified Tamoxifen induced asthma as a serious side effect. The next day I wason the phone with the doctor. Her solution was to take half a dose. I decided toscrew that and after just a week on Tamoxifen, I went off of it … period. Nomore asthma … period.In the meantime, I had been taking Lugol’s iodine at higher and higher doses bymouth as well as painting it on my breast. After three to four months when Iwent back to the doctor, my tumor had indeed reduced from 2.7 cm down to 0.8 cm.You could clearly feel the difference in size too. The doctor, however, cameunglued when I told her I had not taken the Tamoxifen and also that I would nottake it. She yelled at me that I would be begging her for Tamoxifen when I hadmetastases all over my body and was in great pain, etc., etc. It was afrightening nightmare that even after three years I get all stressed out eventhinking about it. The doctor said she would schedule the surgery, and Iwondered why I should have surgery at this point. Why wouldn’t I continue towork at shrinking the tumor to nothing?This was the icing on the cake. She told me that no one can do that. That anyonewho tried alternative means always ended up having to come back to her to haveit cut out! Yikes! Finally, she said that she would give me eight weeks toshrink the tumor then she would cut it out. Ha! I have yet to have surgery. AndI am alive and well. I could tell you more of the story. But the meadow iscalling.Please just start taking your iodine now. Don’t wait!Meet Connie: Uterine fibroids resolved along with endometrial liningnormalizing.I got rid of my uterine fibroids plus my endometrial lining thinned out and wasnow normal. It took about six months.Meet Raymond. His goiter shrank 90 percent. Hemorrhoids are gone.I am by no means an expert, but what I can say is that HIGH dose iodine shrankmy thyroid goiter by 90 percent, and my hemorrhoids are gone, so, it’s beenworking pretty darn well for me!I take about 130 mg a day and the companion nutrients, especially the unrefinedsea salt. I split my dose between Iodoral and Lugol’s. I figure if I do it thatway, I have a better chance of killing nasties in the stomach. If you just takethe Iodoral, it passes the stomach and goes directly to the small intestine. So,I get a one-two punch.I will not always take this much, but right now I’m trying to kill pathogens,shrink tumors, and push out bromine and other toxic halides. I had a lot ofdetox symptoms … acne, rash, sinus pain and pressure, aches and pains BUT Ipushed through to the other side and I’m doing much better now. I used saltflushes to lessen the discomfort. The first week, my thyroid goiter swelled upand it hurt. I got scared. I almost stopped BUT I knew that SOMETHING washappening with my thyroid which had to mean it was using the iodine in some way,so I gave it time and then suddenly it profoundly shrank. Other people have alsoexperienced the shrinking of goiters very quickly.Meet Carla: Her ovarian cysts and fibrocystic breast condition … nowundetectable.After my hysterectomy in 1987, the doctor told me that I had ovarian cysts.Since then, at my last exam, the doctor said there weren’t any there.

[part0005.html#rch08]How much Iodine do most iodine takers use to start? [part0014.html#bqn52]Most veteran iodine users would say start with a low dose such as 12.5 mg andbuild up. Others start at 50 mg and feel fine. Others take even more to feeltheir best. Many doctors recommend starting with the salt loading protocol fortwo weeks before beginning iodine.What is the Iodine Protocol? [part0014.html#bqn53]The Iodine Protocol is the guideline for iodine takers presented by theprincipal iodine doctors at the 2007 Iodine Conferences. The protocol covers theamounts of iodine and companion nutrients the experienced iodine prescribersfound effective. This protocol has withstood the test of time with most patientsand Iodine Literate Practitioners.Is there a test for iodine deficiency? [part0014.html#bqn54]The most reliable test is the 24 hour Iodine Loading Test. This test issometimes used in conjunction with other tests. The iodine loading test must beevaluated by an Iodine Literate Practitioner and repeated after a course ofiodine supplementation. At Breast Cancer Choices, we occasionally see peoplewhose first test isn’t so bad, but when they test a few months later aftersupplementation, the iodine saturation number drops lower discouraging them. Butit appears that the first test was misleading because the iodine absorptiontissues were so damaged or atrophied that the much of the test dosage of Iodoralpassed through the body unabsorbed into the urine.Damaged NIS symporter tissues may be compared to an old, dry sponge. Water runsright off it until it is moist.An experienced Iodine Literate Practitioner will be able to explain why theloading test results may move from high to low, then back up to high again. Thegoal is to make sure absorption trends upward after the second test. The IodineDoctors find the companion nutrients speed up the process.Takeaway info on the Iodine Loading Test: be sure your practitioner knows aboutthe need for periodic retesting until your levels are in the normal range.How does the average person begin taking iodine? [part0014.html#bqn55]See the following example:images [../images/00001.jpeg]Kathy started taking Iodine under the direction of an Iodine LiteratePractitioner. She began by drinking a quarter teaspoon of salt dissolved ineight ounces of water twice a day for fourteen days before starting with Optimoxbrand Iodoral tablets. He suggested the Iodoral because it is the mostpredictable formulation for starting iodine dosing.Her doctor instructed her to start with one 12.5 mg tablet and take it for twoweeks along with the salt water. She was also instructed to take the iodinecompanion nutrients:300-600 Mg magnesium1 tab Optimox ATP Cofactors twice a day200 mcg selenium (or selenomethionine)1,000 mg Vitamin C 3 times per day½ teaspoon of salt per day with foodAdditional ¼ teaspoon of salt twice per dayin eight oz. water.After two weeks, he asked her if she felt any reactions. She didn’t, so heraised the dosage to two 12.5 mg tablets for a total of 25 mg. After another twoweeks, she was instructed to raise the dose again and only report back if shehad side effects. If she didn’t, she was instructed to raise the Iodoral to fourtablets for a total of 50 mg.At this point, Kathy began to get brain fog and a headache. Her doctor told hershe could take the salt water twice a day but stop taking all Iodoral onweekends to flush out toxins the iodine may have dislodged. Breast CancerChoices’ “pulse-dosing strategy” caused all side effects to go away.She is now able to take 50 mg Iodoral every day but she skips one weekend everyonce in a while as per her doctor’s instructions.images [../images/00001.jpeg]Should I take iodine with food? [part0014.html#bqn56]Most people take iodine with food. However, if you are taking Iodoral which wasdesigned to be easy on the stomach, you may have no problem on an empty stomach.What time of the day should I take iodine? [part0014.html#bqn57]Iodine is usually taken in the morning. Some people have reported that takingiodine later in the day has kept them awake at night.Why did Lugol’s Iodine Solution mixed in water upset my stomach?[part0014.html#bqn58]Stomach distress has been reported many times with Lugol’s. That’s why thecoated Iodoral tablet was invented. Sometimes just taking Lugol’s on a fullstomach may help. You may find other brands of iodine which have a similarcoating. If any product is irritating your stomach, the manufacturers advise youto discontinue taking it immediately.Can I take iodine any other way than by mouth? [part0014.html#bqn59]Iodine is often applied to the skin. Some iodine gets in the bloodstream thisway. Topical application is often used by people who are hesitant to take iodineby mouth or want to slow down the absorption of iodine. Much iodine is lost byevaporation this way but it has shown to be surprisingly effective in anemergency.Historically, iodine has also been compounded into rectal or vaginalsuppositories for local use.When using iodine products such as Lugol’s Solution on the skin, the expertsrecommend mixing it with a small amount of oil in the palm of your hand first,then applying it. This method is reported to reduce the chance of irritation.Grapeseed oil, castor oil, jojoba oil or coconut oil make good “carriers” forLugol’s Solution.When can I stop taking iodine supplements? [part0014.html#bqn60]The usual advice is to only take iodine supplements for as long as you want tobe healthy (a healthcare professional’s attempt at humor in an otherwise serioussubject).Can my pet take iodine? How much? [part0014.html#bqn61]Dr. David Brownstein reports that pets have been given Lugol’s Iodine at adosage of 0.08 mg /per pound. Several reports have come in about chickens andparrots preferring Lugol’s treated water. Livestock owners may be familiar withhow iodine enhances animal health and reproduction capacities. The veterinaryuse of iodine goes back decades.Should I take tyrosine with iodine? [part0014.html#bqn62]Some practitioners suggest taking tyrosine, but others suggest avoiding tyrosineif you have any concerns about breast cancer or melanoma. These cancers are inthe same biologic family, and melanoma can be very difficult to treat. Concernsexist that tyrosine can aggravate any melanoma.What are these “Iodine Symporters” I read about on the Internet?[part0014.html#bqn63]According to iodine experts, the symporters are the tissues used by the body totrap iodine from the bloodstream so it can be absorbed by the body.Unfortunately, over time, these tissues can become damaged by pollutants (thinkrust) or become scarce, causing the body to become iodine deficient. In order toheal, the iodine absorbing tissues, supplementing iodine is necessary incombination with antioxidants.Competition for the receptors that absorb iodine is fierce. The halogen group ofelements is controlled by a mechanism called “competitive inhibition.” Bromineusually wins this competition because of its prevalence as an environmentaltoxin. But chlorine, fluorine and the lesser known astatine can knock iodine offthis very appealing receptor.As long as bromine dominates the receptors, iodine deficiency prevails, so thegoal is to overpower and displace the bromine so iodine can get absorbed.My first Iodine Loading Test came back at 75 percent saturation. Then afterthree months taking Iodine, I took another Loading Test and the saturationdropped to 50 percent. How can I have less iodine in my body?[part0014.html#bqn64]We think the initial test may reflect iodine deficiency symporter atrophy whichresolves as iodine repairs the absorption tissues.In our Iodine Investigation Project, we have collected a lot of data on breastcancer patients taking iodine. Occasionally, the loading test after three monthsreports the iodine level dropped from the first test. A 75 percent saturationmight drop to a 50 percent saturation on the second test. Then the third testresult will show an increase.At the Iodine Conference, one of the doctors mentioned this happened to his ownloading tests and some of his patients. What this seems to mean is that thetissues which absorb iodine aren’t working. So the iodine just washes right pastthe absorbers and shows up in the urine, showing a false lab value. Think ofwater flowing over a dry sponge, not absorbing until it gets more water. Theiodine absorbing tissues may atrophy until they get nourished.Once iodine and antioxidants start repairing the absorbing tissues, the IodineLoading Tests will show how much iodine is being absorbed. That will be a moreaccurate reading of iodine saturation.If a patient is clearly iodine deficient, some practitioners will not even beginto test patients’ iodine levels for three months.Is there a test that can measure whether I’m absorbing iodine efficiently?[part0014.html#bqn65]A new testing concept has been developed called the saliva/serum iodide ratiotest. Both 24 hour urine finds are compared with blood iodide levels and salivaiodide levels. Ask your doctor if you are a candidate for this test. This linkexplains the test: www.Optimox.com/pics/Iodine/IOD-13/IOD_13.htm[http://www.Optimox.com/pics/Iodine/IOD-13/IOD_13.htm]Can I apply iodine topically to my breasts? [part0014.html#bqn66]Applying Lugol’s Solution directly to the breast with a brush has been used forat least 150 years for breast pain. In a pinch, when Lugol’s Solution isunavailable, some women have applied Tincture of Iodine. Many report it helps tomix the iodine in your palm with an oil such as jojoba or grapeseed oil to helpprevent possible irritation. Tip: iodine can stain. Don’t wear your favorite brawhile using iodine topically. Lugol’s stains can usually be removed by applyinga paste of vitamin C powder.What is the Funahashi Method? (The Lugol’s–Progesterone Method)[part0014.html#bqn67]“The Funahashi Method” is an invention of the Grass Roots Iodine Movement usedto rapidly speed up the shrinking of breast cysts. It should be more accuratelycalled the Lugol’s-Progesterone Method. Dr. Funahashi has absolutely noconnection to the method named for his experiments which were proven to havesubsequently been shown in patient-to-patient communication to benefit women.Dr. H. Funahashi found progesterone enhanced the uptake of iodine to tumors inanimals which subsequently shrank. The Lugol’s-Progesteone Method should beundertaken under the supervision of an Iodine Literate Practitioner who has anunderstanding of bioidentical hormones.The Lugol’s-Progesterone Method involves applying a small amount of progesteroneto the breasts along with the topical application of Lugol’s Iodine until thecyst disappears. 50 mg of Lugol’s or Iodoral by mouth are used along withtopical applications. The uptake of iodine by progesterone has been observed inother hormone dependent tissues such as the ovaries and uterus. (See Brown-Grantand Rogers, 1972).What about the Prostate? [part0014.html#bqn68]Iodine has been used for over 100 years for prostate disease. Recent reports ofLugol’s Iodine and Iodoral reducing the symptoms of benign prostate disease(BPH) have been coming more frequent. When one five-year iodine taker, aneighty-year-old man, told his doctor he only got up once a night to urinate, shedid not believe him and said he must have forgotten, “because no 80 year-old mangets up only once.”Can local application help there also? [part0014.html#bqn69]A number of men have found an increased effect using Lugol’s Iodine topically tothe testicles with a carrier oil to avoid irritation.What is the T2T Method? (testicle-to-testicle method) is a method of iodineapplication to the skin named for online iodine activist, T2T. He experimentedwith applying 20 drops Lugol’s Iodine to one testicle one night, the othertesticle the next night, alternating in order to enhance sexual performance. TheT2T method has been modified by another activist, “G,” to add grapeseed oil tothe formulation to prevent irritation and increase absorption. Other men havetried this and reported good results. However, with all health strategies,consult your medical professional.What more can I read?

[part0014.html#bqn71]Like any nutrient, sometimes people experience side effects. It’s important tounderstand most symptoms are due to the iodine detoxing the bromine and toxinsfaster than the kidneys and liver can handle it. The Salt Loading Protocolusually addresses detoxification issues.Please see the side effects section in Resources, Part 4[part0031.html#TI1E0-93d4fd601e2c41969bad1e0d6c3e7ac4], for the Iodine RelatedBromide Detox.What are the companion nutrients and do I absolutely need them?[part0014.html#bqn72]The companion nutrients include specific amounts of Vitamin C, niacin,riboflavin, and magnesium along with the Salt Loading Protocol. Patients reportthese specific nutrients boost iodine absorption. See the Resources pages forspecific dosages.What is the difference between consuming refined salt and taking unrefined saltin the salt loading protocol? [part0014.html#bqn73]The Iodine Literate Practitioners recommend using only unprocessed, unbleached,unrefined salt, free of anti-caking and bleaching agents. It is sometimes calledCeltic Salt or sea salt. Redmond’s Real Salt is a brand many people like. Butmany “gourmet,” unprocessed, unrefined salts are available throughout all overthe world. Supplementing unrefined salt is part of the companion nutrientstrategy and different from the salt loading protocol. The supplementary saltappears to support the adrenals. Many unrefined salt-taking patients reportfeeling better, perhaps due to the many minerals in unrefined salt that are notfound in commercial, processed salt.Why did my doctor prescribe iodine tablets and never mention taking salt wateror the companion nutrients? [part0014.html#bqn74]A lot of practitioners don’t understand the Iodine Protocol. They may not evenknow there is a protocol when prescribing iodine and have not read the IodineProject Papers, the Iodine Protocol or Dr. Brownstein’s Iodine book and neverconsult the online user groups. A couple of weeks on any of the user groupswould provide good training in why taking iodine is not always as easy as takinga single pill. The biggest problem the iodine-taking community faces is thecommon belief that there is nothing to know about iodine.I have high blood pressure and have restricted salt. The salt loading scares me.Help? [part0014.html#bqn75]If unprocessed salt is taken in proportion to the right amount of water, youshould not have any problem. The water acts somewhat like a diuretic. Be sure toconsult your iodine-literate practitioner. Read Salt Your Way to Health by DavidBrownstein, MD.Do I have to keep taking iodine for life? [part0014.html#bqn76]As far as we know, you need to take iodine for as long as it takes to build upand maintain tissue stores. Given our constant exposure to bromines, this willprobably be a long time. Some people have been able to reduce their dosagesafter a few years when their Iodine Loading tests shows 90 percent saturation.The general rule is take iodine only as long as you want to be healthy andprotect yourself against the daily bombardment of toxins (such as bromines)which disrupt body functions. The importance of avoiding bromine exposure isdiscussed later in the book.What is the most important thing to know about taking iodine?[part0014.html#bqn77]You should know what is going on in your body when you supplement iodine. If youknow what the process and strategy is, you will be ready for it and know how tohandle it.The answer to that question varies with the individual. But from correspondingwith thousands of iodine takers, the salt-loading protocol (taking a certainamount of salt water periodically) has been the most helpful in relieving anddetoxing symptoms of bromide and other impurities which iodine pushes from thecells.In my family, I’ve seen salted water get rid of brain fog or a headache within ahalf hour.The salt water method has been used for over a hundred years. Most recently theUS Army used an intravenous sodium solution when the Gulf War soldiers gotbromide toxicity from Pyrodostigmine bromium medication prescribed to protectagainst a possible nerve gas attack. See “A Review of the Scientific LiteratureAs It Pertains to Gulf War Illnesses” by Beatrice Golomb, MD, PhD.images [../images/00001.jpeg]I can’t repeat this enough: at Breast Cancer Choices’ Iodine InvestigationProject, we developed the “pulse-dosing” technique to remedy detox symptoms.Pulse dosing means stopping iodine (but not the salt loading protocol orcompanion nutrients) for 48 hours to flush toxins from the kidneys.images [../images/00001.jpeg]Do I still need iodine if I take thyroid medication? [part0014.html#bqn78]Some believe thyroid medication makes the body metabolize iodine faster so it’seven more important to take iodine if you are currently taking thyroidmedication.Which parts of the body does iodine affect? [part0014.html#bqn79]Iodine inhabits every cell of the body. Some organs require more iodine thanothers but it’s hard to say which part of any individual’s body may need more,as some people may show, for example, obvious deficiencies in the breast, and inothers it will show up in the skin or other organs.images [../images/00001.jpeg]More Iodine StoriesMeet Sue: Energy returns, breasts soften, dermoid cyst disappears.I’m a 45 year-old female. I heard about iodine on the net and thought itprobably can’t hurt since so many others on the Curezone Iodine Forum web sitehad been using it for years. I tried iodine to see if it would work on my lumpybreasts. When I first took 50 mg Iodoral, I got a huge surge of mental energy.Not like caffeine, just clear thinking. I didn’t realize I had been thatslow-brained before. I’m a writer so this brain boost really came in handy. Ittook about three months before my breasts became squishy again. This is a reliefbecause I was nervous that inflamed breasts might lead to cancer. My skin alsogot clearer and a dermoid cyst I’ve had on my waist suddenly wasn’t there.Meet Mindy: Graves’ Disease symptoms improve.I was diagnosed with Graves’ Disease about a year ago and a few months afterthat, my right eye became swollen and exhibited mild exophthalmos. I recentlybegan taking 25 mg Iodoral with Vitamin C, magnesium, selenium and sea salt.I’ve noticed that my pulse has slowed down from 88 to 78 and that I don’t need 9hours of sleep anymore.Meet Frank: Prostatitus improves. Less nighttime urination. Hair regrowth.I have not posted this anywhere yet. Iodine cured my prostate problems, calledprostatitus. My symptoms were weak urine flow, starting & stopping, three ormore trips to the bathroom every night. I slowly titrated iodine from ½ mg to 50mg over a four month period, going slow to prevent detox symptoms. After 3months and iodine at 25 mg daily with required supplements, it was clear that myprostate problems were fading away.After 4 months of iodine at 50mg daily, my prostate problems are GONE. Now Ionly get up once in the night, and even last all night without getting up attimes. Urine flow is great, and life is good!Also, my hair seems to be growing in.Meet Charlene: Hypothyroid disease with autoimmune antibodies resolves, breastscan goes from a high risk level 4 to level 1.I wanted to tell you my success story, to encourage you to keep getting the newsout about Iodorol. I am hypothyroid and have been seeing a holistic MD for thepast 3 years. He put me on Iodorol (I take 50 mg/day) for my thyroid antibodies,breast health, and because I live in Michigan (the Goiter Belt).Two years ago I got my first thermoscan (infrared mammography) that was a Level4 on one side. It scared me half to death!My MD increased my iodine, had me take Calcium d-glucarate, and 6 months ofOncoplex. I am happy to report after 6 months my thermoscan down-graded to level3, and now a year and a half later, it is a level one—normal on both sides! Notonly that, the thyroid antibodies are no longer showing up in my blood work. Iam thanking the Lord, and being faithful with my Iodorol & ATP co-factors, whichI’ve also been taking for a few years.Thought you would like a success story!Meet Mary Ann: Extreme bladder issues and pain, fertility issues, low basaltemperature, history of irregular periods, fibrocystic breasts, ovarian cysts,mood and energy issues. Now on the mend.I believe that my misadventures with iodine deficiency began with early (justturned 10) menses—very painful and heavy. The next few years I had irregularperiods—no periods for months at a time—ovarian cysts—was underweight, had lowbasal temp, low blood pressure, low blood sugar, and slow heart rate.Had trouble conceiving until I finally got my weight up to 105 (age 24, 5’ 4”,medium frame). Had typical thyroid issues that follow pregnancies and breastfeeding.Had my first bladder infection at age 18—and have been in a living nightmare ofrecurrent infections, misdiagnoses, bladder neck polyps, extreme and painfultreatments, WAY too many antibiotics, and enough pain at times to make meconsider suicide.NOW I discover that bladder issues like mine are also a symptom of iodinedeficiency—and that iodine therapy not only reverses the cause but treats thebladder and infections—including urethral and bladder spasms. I can onlyimagine, but I think these spasms may be similar to prostate issues.I have had my urethra spasm so hard that it clamped down and shut off urineflow. I have had to high tail it to the ER for an immediate catheterization—orliterally face a ruptured bladder. As you might imagine, the cath bag would lookmore like blood than urine.So NOW I find that the answer all along has been iodine. And, even just ten daysinto 12.5 mg iodine/iodide therapy, I feel more comfortable with mybladder/urethra that I can remember feeling in years. Better mood and energytoo.Meet Monica: Suffering from Paget’s Disease, a kind of breast cancer affectingthe skin, it improved in three months. See Figure 3 [part0018.html#fig3].Back in 2009 my endocrinologist decided to lower my thyroid meds because of theTSH test (I am thyroidless) and consequently destroyed my entire endocrinesystem in the process. It was about the time I first reported my flakey nippleto the doctor that does my mammograms and whole breast ultrasound.Fast forward to 2012, I decided I was tired of the flakey nipple that I assumedwas eczema and went to see a dermatologist. She prescribed several differenttypes of creams over a few months. The symptoms would disappear momentarily thenreturn. It was finally decided to do a biopsy. On July 5th, 2012, the verdictwas in. I was diagnosed with Paget’s disease.Per the lab report: The S-100 stain demonstrates epidermal and dermal Langerhanscells. The Cytokeratin stain is positive. Cytokeratin-7 stain is focallypositive. The Estrogen receptor stain also focally positive. The Progesteronereceptor stain is focally weakly positive. The Gross Cystic Disease fluidprotein stain is negative. The Mart-1 stain is negative. The CEA stain isstrongly positive. The results were confirmed by a second lab two weeks later.I was sent for an MRI immediately. Nothing has ever shown up on the mammogram orultrasound. The MRI showed asymmetric flattening of the nipple with periareolaredema and contrast enhancement compatible with given diagnosis of Paget’sdisease. Retroarolar intraductal carcinoma is not seen. A round 1.1 × 0.8 cmright level one axillary lymph node is suspicious. There are scattered cysts,approximately 15. There is abnormal skin thickening and enhancement seen in theright Breast anteriorly over an area of approximately 6 cm × 4 cm in transverseand AP dimensions respectively.There is, however, no significant non-masslike enhancement in the retroarolarright breast to suggest extensive ductal carcinoma in situ.When I received my diagnosis, I was immediately sent to the surgeon. The courseof action was either partial removal of the breast with reconstruction toinclude radiation or the other option, a mastectomy.The doctor who does my mammograms wanted me to have a bi-lateral mastectomybecause I take natural hormones supplements. The oncologist had the same opinionabout removing my breast. I also had two other doctors telling me to remove mybreast, before I decided I was probably doing this alone.I do not do anything these days without researching the alternatives after whatwas done to me in 2009. It has been a long road back to health. I know from mycompromised immune system that I am still working on, radiation was not for me.I have been under the guidance of a remarkable nutritionist and a naturopathicdoctor since 2009. I had been taking iodine, but only 225 mcg. About a monthafter my diagnosis, I started taking 37.5 mg of Iodoral and then 2 weeks laterupped it to 50 mg of Iodoral where I remain today. Approximately a month aftermy diagnosis, I started painting my breasts with Lugol’s Solution at thedirection of my nutritionist.I was putting it straight on with a Q-tip to start out. Later, I learned aboutcarrier oils and now apply it after I butter up with coconut oil. My iodineloading test showed full saturation in September.The changes to my breast were amazing. At first, the area looked horrible. I hadlarge patches of dark dead skin that eventually sloughed off. Within a fewmonths, my breast looked pretty much normal, with the exception that my nippleis not the normal dark color. My hopes are that with continued use of the Iodinewith changes in diet and detoxing, that I can get this under manageable control.Only time will tell. Right now I am feeling pretty good.images [../images/00001.jpeg]image [../images/00005.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"Chapter Nine [part0005.html#rch09]FAQ 5What Happens When You Take Iodine? [part0005.html#rch09] 1. Remember that competitive situation between Iodine and Bromine? Wheniodine supplementation builds up in your bloodstream, iodine will “chase”bromine off its seats on the receptors. As they compete for the same seats,iodine chases bromine into the bloodstream. Bromine goes on the run in your bodylike an escaped rat, looking for a new place to sit. If displaced bromine isn’texcreted through the kidneys fast enough, it will seat itself in thebloodstream, thyroid, brain, skin, etc., and you may get symptoms. 2. Die-Off Detox: Iodine also possesses antibiotic, antiparisitic,antifungal and antiviral properties and can displace metals. So severaldetoxification actions can occur at the same time as bromide is escaping yourtissues as iodine chases it. 3. Bromide Sedation: Bromide is also sedating and was used in the early1900s as a sedative, so if you absorb the detoxified bromine faster than youexcrete it, symptoms such as headaches, fatigue or runny nose can occur. Brainfog or sedation may be a result of the bromine that was sequestered quietly inyour tissues suddenly getting mobilized into your bloodstream and making youfeel dopey. A more complete list of iodine-related detoxification symptoms canbe found in Part 4 [part0031.html#TI1E0-93d4fd601e2c41969bad1e0d6c3e7ac4],Resources. 4. Mood changes have been reported by some. As always, when the symptomsget uncomfortable, the iodine patient activists have found stopping iodine andusing the Salt Loading Protocol to be an effective remedy.Sometimes (not always) bromides and other toxins get “stuck.” When detoxedbromides, dead microbes and metals can’t get out of your body fast enough, theyappear to get trapped on the way out of your body. This is when symptoms occurand detox needs to be intensified to release the trapped bromides into yourbody’s detoxification pathways such as the kidneys and liver. Salt water andVitamin C have been shown to help excrete bromides. Others report that 500 mgniacin or the ATP Cofactors help. Zinc has proved helpful for skin problems.Both the Curezone Iodine Forum and The Yahoo Iodine Group have found that detoxpathways such as the liver should be cleaned up. See the iodine online groupsfor other detox strategies such as saunas, detox formulas and herbs.Remember, detoxification is a good thing. Getting rid of toxins makes the organsstronger and enhances the absorption of iodine and other nutrients. Again, noteveryone experiences detoxification symptoms.Read more about Iodine Related Bromide and Toxin Detoxification Symptoms in theResources section of this book.images [../images/00001.jpeg]More Iodine StoriesMeet Jim: Increased testosterone levels.There is no question iodine increases testosterone. I’ve raised my free andtotal Testosterone 60 percent since starting iodine 12 months ago (monthly bloodwork). Still have a ways to go to get into range for my age. I’m now taking 100mg of iodine.There is no doubt iodine has been the most important component. I took a veryconservative approach initially and started with single mg level dosages, butonly experienced noticeable changes when getting to 50 to 100 mg levels. Scaleup as quickly as possible while keeping detox manageable.I take tribulus, fenugreek, damiana, American ginseng and maca along with theiodine.Meet Howard: Heart rhythm disorder (atrial fibrillation) improves.I’ve had atrial fib for about 20 years after several bouts with Lyme Disease.After a few months of taking 50 mg Iodoral, my doctor listened and said, “Yourheart beat seems fairly even today. Are you doing anything different?” I saidtaking iodine and he brushed it off.The next time I visited he remarked that my heart was much more even again. Irepeated that the only thing I’m doing different is taking Iodoral. He said hewould investigate the relationship between iodine and afib. He took about a yearto research. Now he prescribes iodine regularly to many of his patients for manydifferent complaints. Author’s note: many studies exist associating iodinedeficiency with cardiovascular disease. For a review, see Cann, SA, (2006).Meet Grace: Wrist pain improves.I already had a C5-6 fusion surgery 10 years ago. Things were getting worseagain. The pain was getting so bad and the numbness was going more up my arm,into my elbow. However, after putting the iodine/coconut oil on my wrist, Idon’t know, I may just not even need the MRI the doctor is contemplating.Now, maybe I won’t even need anything more than the iodine! I also put some moreon this morning, and now it feels great. When at the computer and using themouse, it causes a lot of strain on my right forearm, too. Hopefully, that won’thurt so much anymore, either.I also decided that since it helped my arm that I would put some on my neck,near where they did the fusion surgery. Fatigue is the reason I originallydecided to add the Iodine Protocol to the Low Dose Naltrexone because it hadhelped so much, and others who took it had been helped by the iodine.Meet John: Allergies disappearing, cherry angiomas falling off.I have remained off of all allergy medications—using only oral iodine, Ponarisiodized emollient nasal oil, and iodized Miracell ear care oil since this pastMonday. My allergy symptoms continue to improve daily—and I need less Ponariseach day—even while the spring pollen count goes up.Even though the count is still low/medium, in the past, I would have alreadystarted to get more symptomatic. The pollen forecast here indicates that nextweek the pollen count will be very high, which will tell me even more about myallergy status. I am NOT staying indoors with the windows shut and the airsystem clearing the air. I have the windows open and am spending time outdoors.I probably will close the house and clean the air when the pollen count goesabove medium.I mentioned before that I have a few small and a very few, bigger—cherryangiomas—have had them since my mid 40s. Some of the smallest ones are drying upand flaking off now when I shower with a wash cloth. So, I have started treatinga few of the larger ones with tincture of iodine to see what happens to them.Also, in Dr. Brownstein’s Salt book, he recommends sea salt & hydrogen peroxidein bathwater to detox through the skin. I’m going to try that, too.Meet Jesse: Hair loss stopped. Body temperature normalizes.The main benefit I have noticed so far is cessation of hair loss when I wash myhair. My temp has risen to almost normal. I have excess fat on my tummy whichwas cold to touch. A Chinese medicine practitioner told me this should be warm,but I was unsuccessful in warming it up until I started the iodine. Now it istoasty warm to touch. I am hoping this means it might disappear in due course!Meet Belinda: Painful breasts, hypothyroidism, 50 pounds excess weight resolved.Thank you for introducing me to iodine. At 54, my breasts were like balls ofrocks and I was 50 pounds overweight. I was diagnosed as hypothyroid but themedication never did anything. Then I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I begantaking Iodoral because it was the main part of my integrative doctor’ssupplement protocol.I experienced a little brain fog detox when I started because I skipped the saltwater part of the iodine protocol. Then I started it and all the brain fog wentaway. Gradually, my weight just came down to normal. I was so thrilled that whenI had an all-women birthday party, I bought little bottles of Iodoral as partyfavors.

[part0005.html#rch10]How do people get rid of any side effects that occur while first taking iodine?[part0014.html#bqn80] 1. “Salt Loading” The use of the salt loading method to escort bromideout of the body fast has been used for over a hundred years. When Gulf Warsoldiers experienced bromide toxicity from the experimental use ofPyridostigmine Bromide (supposedly a nerve gas protectant) the Army used a saltsolution IV as a detox agent. Salt water “captures” the bromide so it doesn’t lodge back in thesystem. If you take the salt loading protocol, you should prevent most, if notall, of the bromide detox effect. Some doctors even recommend using the saltloading procedure before starting iodine supplementation. See the Salt Loadingrecipe in Part 4 [part0031.html#TI1E0-93d4fd601e2c41969bad1e0d6c3e7ac4], theResources section of this book. 2. Reduce the iodine dosage and build up gradually. 3. Pulse-dose That means try taking no iodine for 48 hours to flush thekidneys and other detoxification pathways—then restarting. Many iodine usershave found this tip very effective. Some report feeling a kind of euphoria afterthe 48 hour iodine detox/rest period.What is unrefined salt? [part0014.html#bqn81]Any salt that has unprocessed or unrefined marked on the label. Redmond’s RealSalt or Celtic Salt are two well known brands. Trader Joe’s also sells a nicecoarse, unrefined sea salt from France. Please read Salt Your Way to Health, byDavid Brownstein, MD, available at www.DrBrownstein.com[http://www.DrBrownstein.com] for an exciting read on why salt is a powerful andmisunderstood vital nutrient.Do I need to take ½ teaspoon unrefined salt on the iodine protocol even if I’mtaking the salt loading protocol? [part0014.html#bqn82]The extra unrefined salt is highly recommended by the iodine doctors and theYahoo Iodine Group. The extra salt supports the adrenals and helps the rest ofthe nutrients work better.What do I do if I get side effects from iodine supplementation?[part0014.html#bqn83]Make sure you have an Iodine Literate Practitioner who knows how to use saltwater and the iodine companion nutrients in conjunction with iodinesupplementation. Make sure he understands that “pulse dosing” (stopping iodinefor 48 hours) is often effective for detox symptoms. See the Salt LoadingProtocol in Part 4 [part0031.html#TI1E0-93d4fd601e2c41969bad1e0d6c3e7ac4], theResources section of this book.I felt sluggish while taking more than 12.5 mg iodine? What’s going on?[part0014.html#bqn84]If you understand how iodine supplementation works, you will be better preparedto manage any possible detox symptoms with your doctor. Review the Salt LoadingProtocol in the Resources section, Part 4[part0031.html#TI1E0-93d4fd601e2c41969bad1e0d6c3e7ac4]. Often using the saltwater recipe (salt loading protocol) combined with a two day stop from iodinewill banish any sluggishness or brain fog. Thousands of iodine takers reportthis result.I started taking iodine for breast cysts two weeks ago and my breasts arebecoming more tender. Shouldn’t my breasts be feeling the opposite?A small but measurable number of participants of Breast Cancer Choices’ IodineInvestigation Project have reported temporary breast tenderness. I’m not awareof any iodine takers whose breast pain continued after taking iodine for severalmonths if they took iodine along with the recommended companion nutrients. I’msure there must be some women whose breasts don’t respond to iodine. I justhaven’t heard from them.We think that some iodine deficient breasts accustomed to iodine scarcity expandtemporarily to trap as much iodine as possible. We’ve called this a “postscarcity effect.” Once the breasts get accustomed to a sufficient iodine supplythe swelling resolves. This is only a working theory on the basis of how thebody adapts to other types of nutrient or calorie restriction as an adaptationand survival mechanism.After a week of supplementing iodine, I got an odd swallowing sensation. What isthat? [part0014.html#bqn85]This effect has been reported in a percentage of patients. It isn’t clear if theswelling is a bromide detox effect as the tissues get reorganized, or if it isthe “post scarcity effect” of the thyroid trying to trap as much iodine aspossible, as fast as possible, in an attempt to compensate for any future iodine“famines.” Again, once the thyroid learns it will be getting a steady supply ofiodine, the swelling goes down. Check with your Iodine Literate Practitioner.After taking iodine, the ferritin level on my blood test dropped. Why?[part0014.html#bqn86]Ferritin levels dropping have been reported several times. While the exactreason is unknown, the belief is that the metabolic boost that iodine restoresmay make the body use more than its usual amount of iron. The Yahoo Iodine Grouprecommends taking a B complex vitamin plus Floradix Iron plus Herbs along withfood until ferritin levels stabilize.I took iodine for my breasts, and my family doctor said my TSH blood test showedit made me hypothyroid. [part0014.html#bqn87]Elevated TSH blood tests have been reported numerous times in peoplesupplementing with iodine. This doesn’t necessarily mean you are going hypo. TSHchanges can mean your body is changing as it accommodates this abundance of aprecious nutrient. Usually the reference range for free T3 and T4 remain normal.Elevated TSH can be another post scarcity effect as the body makes more iodineabsorber tissues to absorb the new bounty of iodine supplementation. Your doctorshould read Dr. Jorge Flechas’ article, Orthoiodosupplementation in a primarycare practice, especially paragraph five:www.Optimox.com/pics/Iodine/IOD-10/IOD_10.htm[http://www.Optimox.com/pics/Iodine/IOD-10/IOD_10.htm].The ATP Cofactors have also been used to help TSH return to normal levels.Iodine cured my painful breasts. But as soon as my family doctor saw my TSH labtests, he prescribed thyroid hormone and now my painful breasts are back. Whathappened? [part0014.html#bqn88]We hear this report occasionally, that prescribing thyroid hormones brings thefibrocystic breast disease back. It appears that prescribing extra thyroid medsspeeds up the metabolism of the thyroid, making it need more iodine. So thethyroid, the master regulator, may “steal” the iodine in the bloodstream thathad been happily going to the breasts. Dr. Flechas has reported a study oflong-term thyroid med takers where they tend to get more breast cancer (Kapdiand Wolfe, 1976). These women were not taking iodine to support the increasedmetabolism, of course, and one study is not conclusive.It raises the possibility of the iodine-stealing theory when we see painfulbreasts return once they’re exposed to too much thyroid hormone and not enoughiodine. The trick is trying to get a true picture of your thyroid status from anexperienced Iodine Literate Practitioner.images [../images/00001.jpeg]More Iodine StoriesMeet Violet, breast cancer survivor: New breast calcifications (often aprecursor to breast cancer) resolve.On my recent trip to central Australia I took iodine drops with me.I have been avoiding a mammogram due to the pain factor, around my ex-tumor bed.I was thinking of having an MRI but as I have had dreadful reactions toanesthetic pharmaceuticals in general, and breakout in a rash from something assimple as a bandaid. The thought of being injected with gadolinium scared me offthe MRI. My oncologist totally understood.I haven’t had a mammogram since around May 2009. My right breast had quite a fewclustered calcifications. Late last year my BS sent me a letter, concerning mymammo appointment that I had been avoiding.Anyway, I caved in because I understand that clustered calcifications are seenboth in benign and malignant disease. So I had my ever sooo painful mammo, whichwas a tad different to the way I was last examined. The tech actually stayed inthe room, and didn’t leave. Anyway, we got to chatting and she allowed me toview my breast images on the large computer screen. Cool!I said, “They look particularly clean, in both breasts; I can’t see anythingsinister, like calcifications, can you?”She said, “No, it all looks very clean to me. It appears that the calcificationshave all disappeared.”She then said, “Wait here, I’ll see what the radiologist thinks.” I had myfingers crossed and a huge grin.They both came back and said. “There’s no evidence of calcifications, we’ll passthese images on to your oncologist, and I’m sure his conclusion will be thesame.”IT WAS!!! He said both breasts were crystal clear … no problems whatsoever.My protocol is working for me.Thank you to BreastCancerChoices.org for their wonderful “Iodine resources”…Thank you from the bottom of my heart … xxxxx.Meet Ronnie: Varicose veins and broken capillaries healing.Not only have varicose veins started to go away, I have a tiny patch of brokencapillaries on my chin that is now disappearing.

Our family spent afortune on a dozen different treatments. I’m shocked that I had to get breastcancer and discover Iodoral to get rid of the psoriasis.Meet Wanda, suffering from painful fibrocystic breasts.A subject I take very seriously. Two years ago, I was well on my way to BreastCancer. I’d had fibrocystic breast disease (FBD) for a long time; FBD is verymuch a precursor to breast cancer. By the way, some 90 percent of American womenhave FBD, NOW. It manifests as lumps and/or breast tenderness, can be cyclical(with the menstrual period), in advanced stages, one can have pain throughoutthe month.So, I discovered iodine supplementation. The results have been amazing. I lost afull cup size of painful, swollen tissue. The texture of my breasts completelychanged; they have become very soft. I’m 95 percent done; I don’t know if thelast remaining area is scar tissue, or not. I haven’t been diligent aboutsupplementing for a while, now, I’ve gotten complacent and cocky.

[part0005.html#rch12]Reminder: since most readers of this book are not chemists, consider the termsiodine and iodide interchangeable, unless the difference is relevant to thediscussion such as the iodide in iodized salt.Similarly, the reader should consider the terms bromine and bromideinterchangeable as we discuss the power of any bromine-related chemical toinhibit iodine.What does bromine have to do with iodine deficiency? [part0014.html#bqn90]Iodine deficiency may be partly a bromide dominance disease, meaning anunderlying cause of iodine deficiency may be that we are exposed to so muchbromine-related chemicals through baked goods, fire retardants and pesticides,and other hidden sources. Bromine has bullied what little iodine we have in ourdiet off the receptors.What is bromide dominance? [part0014.html#bqn91]A bromide dominance condition may develop when bromide, acquired throughenvironmental, occupational, iatrogenic or dietary exposure, causes brominelevels in the body to rise high enough to inhibit iodine enzyme metabolism.Iodine supplementation alters the competitive bromine-iodine relationship,causing bromide excretion. Thus, bromide dominance is diminished and properiodine enzyme metabolism may be restored.What in my environment contains bromine? [part0014.html#bqn92]In my opinion, the worst exposure to bromine comes from brominated fireretardant chemicals called BFRs. They are located in rugs, cars, mattresses,upholstery, electronics, children’s pajamas, draperies and other items includingchildren’s toys. Bromide dust drifts out of the items, is inhaled and gets intoour bloodstream.I read labels. How am I exposed to bromide in foods? [part0014.html#bqn93]Bromated flour is the norm in baked goods as a dough conditioner. Unless thelabel specifically reads “unbromated flour,” assume the flour is bromated. Alocal baker told me she was unable to obtain unbromated commercial flour. Lookfor bromide on labels as “BVO,” which stands for brominated vegetable oil. Somesodas and sports drinks contain bromide. Mountain Dew is the best known beveragefor containing brominated vegetable oil (BVO).If you have ordinary toast with breakfast, a sandwich and Mountain Dew forlunch, and then drink a brominated sports drink after your five o’clock jog, youhave medicated yourself all day long with bromine and helped purge iodine fromyour tissues.See Part 4 [part0031.html#TI1E0-93d4fd601e2c41969bad1e0d6c3e7ac4].

The UK banned bromate in bread in1990. Canada banned bromate in bread in 1994. Sweden is particularly aggressivein banning bromide fire retardants. Since the ban, much less bromide is measuredin mothers’ milk in Sweden.

But the outside-in painting goes direct to theorgans in a profound way.I have painted 20 drops of 5% elemental iodine (Lugols should work too) on oneside of the testes and perineum and then the next night, on the other side,making sure that 48 hours separates the same side painting. That way no sunburneffect happens.A slight burning occurs momentarily when painting takes place, but is verytolerable.Incredible results occurred regarding erections. Also, the amount of semenincreased.Erections became even more responsive when I added the oral supplements K2 mk4.When I added 15 mg, the erections improved in a profound way, several minutesafter ingesting the K2. The next morning I awoke with a teenage erection thatonly a morning pee would relieve. Strangely, I had to reduce the K2 mk4 to just5 mg a night; but I suspect 3 mg or even 1 mg would work for younger peoplesince I am now 56.I always do the iodine painting at bed time only …I take a dropper and fill it up. Drip about 20 drops back into the bottle and toget an idea where 20 drops are on the dropper glass. That way you don’t have tosit there and drip 20 drops each time, give or take a few drops.I load about 20 drops into the dropper and drag the dropper in the middle of theperineum starting near the backside to the front. I quickly take four fingersand spread the Iodine over the entire area which will include the inside of theleg, the perineum and entire side of the testes.The next night, I do the other side. After 48 hours pass, you get back to theoriginal side you started with.Of course, I was still taking large amounts of iodine orally also!I did it every night for a long time. Now I do it a couple of times a month.Meet Nancy: Endometriosis resolves. Sex life restored.I’m 34. After using Iodoral (an iodine supplement) for the past 6 months, I havenot had any endometriosis pain and my sex life has been restored, after years ofmisdiagnosis and indifference by many doctors!Out of desperation, I sought out a holistic/naturopath doctor for help. Hetested my iodine levels right away. It only required a simple saliva and urinetest. Turns out my iodine levels were LESS than one part per million. I thinkregular levels for a woman my age were suppose to be around 10 or 12. Heimmediately put me on a high dosage of Iodoral supplements.After retesting my iodine periodically, my iodine level went up, and my painvanished! I now only take one to two supplements a day to maintain and have beenpain-free these past 6 months. (I had the other usual hormone related troubleswith endometriosis, and they have subsided as well.) I was skeptical butdesperate enough to try this.I hope someone else can benefit from this information. It’s such a simple,non-intrusive thing to try. No side effects. Find a naturopath doctor, make surethey can test your iodine levels via the saliva and urine. If they can’t dothat, then keep looking. It’s important to find someone who knows what they aredoing. Research the net about iodine deficiency. It is worth your time! I haveneedlessly suffered from endometriosis symptoms since my early 20s. I was notdiagnosed until two or three years ago. I know how disruptive this can be toyour life. You MUST check into iodine supplementation. It has been my miracle!images [../images/00001.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"Part 3 [part0005.html#rpt03]Discovering the World’s Oldest Medicine [part0005.html#rpt03]"},{"pageContent":"Chapter Thirteen [part0005.html#rch13]Where Does Iodine Come From? [part0005.html#rch13]If we knew what it was we were doing, it would not be called research, would it?—Albert EinsteinDr. David Brownstein calls iodine “the most misunderstood nutrient.”I’ll say! How do you learn about something so misunderstood? Where do you begin?I’d taught sociology and philosophy for a living but had zero scientifictraining. Other than retaining a solid professional ability to conduct researchand split hairs, I was clueless. But I couldn’t let being clueless stop me.There were no textbooks on how to learn about iodine, so I was on my own whetherI liked it or not.Iodine had become so important to my own health that I needed to create anexpedition to learn about this transforming element. Where could I start? Howmuch was there to learn, anyway? I tried to remember how I had learned beforewhen I was out of my depth.Field Guide? What is a field guide? The answer to this question came on myeighth summer when my father squeezed us kids into the car with two weeks’ worthof beach gear and handed me a book called a Field Guide for Seashore Life. Heknew how to keep me quiet during the long drive down the Garden State Parkway.Included were terrific pictures and diagrams of how marine life at the shore wasset up.images [../images/00001.jpeg]How to observe. How to question. The book gave me a structure for my curiosity.It gave me confidence.images [../images/00001.jpeg] I had never thought of nature as so organized that someone could draw ablueprint of the places where the natural things lived. So, natural things had ahome just like people. The best part of the guide was it laid out an actualhow-to for collecting and preserving what they called “specimens.”—that was theword for the bounty surrounding my bare feet on the sand.According to the book, conducting a research expedition into the field andfinding specimens was the official way of learning. Back then, I didn’t knowthere were actual ways of learning. I thought teachers taught the three Rs.Period. I thought they inserted information into your brain. The authors calledit a field guide because the emphasis was on throwing the student in the deepend so she could figure out how to learn.How to observe. How to question. The book gave me a structure for my curiosity.It gave me confidence. You identify your mission and jump into the field. Usebinoculars, use a shovel, use a magnifying glass but learn to pry, learn toobserve. You can watch others observe but you have to grow your own observation“chops.” Otherwise, people will tell you what you see and you’ll always seethrough a second-hand filter.According to The Field Guide, the object was to hunt specimens down, identifythem and figure out the story behind them. Wow, that was for me. I wanted todiscover how all this ocean stuff fit together. How hard could that be? TheField Guide was only about 200 pages.In retrospect, I had two things going for me that would seed who I am and what Ido:First, I was young enough to be curious. Learning hadn’t been used against meyet in school. I liked being a beginner. Learning was still my fun friend. Noone had told me I wasn’t qualified to learn by myself.Second, I owe my parents a debt of gratitude because they just left us kids tolearn by ourselves. They got out of our way.First thing the next morning, I grabbed my yellow pail and shovel and headed offthe back porch of our seashore bungalow and headed to the bay in my bathingsuit. My mother yelled after me what she and the other moms always yelled whenthey didn’t go with us, “Don’t go in the water past your knees.”The Expedition BeginsI walked along the sand in my flip flops, determined to search for theseseashore specimen things in the field guide.I scooped up some shells that looked like slippers and some tiny iridescentdisks the size of quarters. I wasn’t sure how these things had ever been aliveor if they were still alive. The book said to put the specimens in the yellowpail with seawater just in case. But by the time I reached the jetty rocks, Irealized my flip flops wouldn’t let me climb over the rocks without slipping. Itried anyway but just scuffed my feet.I ran back home and got my sneakers. I had noticed seaweeds and shells growingon the rocks so I asked for my father’s putty knife to pry away specimens. I setout once again to the bay and climbed the rocks with ease, prying off limpets,seaweeds and mussels from the rocks and putting them into my plastic pail. Atthe cove in the rocks, I discovered a little tide pool with a whole differentset of sea life living there. The life under the water looked clean andmagnified, larger than life. I jumped in with my sneakers and began picking upspecimens and covering them with water just as the book instructed. But mysneakers sloshed and slipped in the calf-high water. Sand got through the canvasand scraped my feet. I couldn’t reach the tide pool sea-life with sneakers. Ineeded boots.Back to the bungalow I ran, sneakers sloshing, my yellow pail full. “Mom, thesneakers don’t work in the water. I’m gonna need boots.” My mother laid mysneakers on the porch to dry in the sun and got out my green, frog-eye rainboots. I emptied my pail of slimy specimens into an enamel basin and set it downin the shade under the porch so the specimens wouldn’t die.Down to the bayside I headed again, this time in my bathing suit and rain bootsoutfit. The tide was going out. I ignored the glances of the other kids and mademy way back over the now slimy, low-tide rocks to the tide pool. I jumped intothe water with my boots and began scooping as many specimens as I could. But thetide pool was full of so many creatures that I couldn’t fit them into the toypail.Back to the house I went, sunburn starting on my shoulders. “Lynne, you’regetting red. You need Noxema,” my mother said, going into the house andreturning with a blue jar. She spread the methol cream on my shoulders and face.“That should do it. Are you finished for today?”“No, Mom, this time I’m gonna need a bigger pail.”She looked concerned. “Bigger pail?” What was I getting into if I needed abigger pail? She was thinking about the ship captain in Jaws. After his firstencounter with the Great White shark, he says, “We’re gonna need a bigger boat.”Still, she saw my passion. She found an aluminum kitchen pail under the sink andwatched me adventure out one more time. By then, the sun had risen high and itslight bounced off the water, making it harder to see, so I kept my head down. Ididn’t want to go back for sunglasses.Along the bay I walked again, this time smeared with Noxema, boots clopping andgrown-up pail swinging. Now I was prepared. Over the rocks I climbed and jumpedinto the tide pool. Sea gulls screamed overhead, knowing I was competition fortheir lunch. A scary-looking horseshoe crab scooted away in the water, but I wasable to scoop up some fuzzy sea crabs and at least ten different seaweeds, ameasled cowrie, Atlantic slipper shells and a whelk egg case. I piled each intomy pail and covered them with water so they wouldn’t die. They needed to bealive so I could identify them. By the time the aluminum pail was half full, Irealized I could barely lift it. I threw some stuff back to lighten the load.But the pail remained heavy.Crap! Why didn’t anyone tell me a full three gallon pail weighs more than aneight year-old can carry? I trod home with my pail only half-full of specimensand a funny green seaweed called Bladderwrack. By the time I reached the porchmy arms ached, but frustration had turned to pride. I wasn’t about to wait forsomeone to teach me how to collect specimens or have them carry them home forme. I wasn’t going to wait until I knew exactly what I was doing. If I hadwaited for either skill or strength, I would never have begun or known what Iwas capable of. The next day I returned from the bay with another half bucket ofspecimens. And then another. I was in my element.Every night at the shore, I showed my parents the specimens and repeated thenames of each shell or organism. “How do you memorize all the names?” my fatherasked.“But I didn’t memorize them,” I answered. “I just looked them up. All thepictures are right there in the Field Guide.“Good work, Sweetie,” he said. “You never know what will come in handy someday.”Another Field Trip, Another ExpeditionWhen Iodine transformed my life decades later, there was no Field Guide forresearching iodine history. I set out on an expedition with clues but no map,with a few books but no artifacts, with a handful of theories but no casestudies. I learned from the old Merck Manual that iodine was the most used tumorremedy in the 1800s and a treatment for lung diseases, goiter and even forsyphilis. But what about before that? • Where did iodine come from? Iodine must have left a trail of artifactsand information behind. • Where did the trail begin? • When did people first start using iodine products? • Could I find some of these iodine products the way I had collectedspecimens from the sea? • When were seaweeds first recorded? • If iodine was so important, why was it invisible in my life? • Iodine wasn’t used much as an antiseptic in my generation but Iremembered seeing it. Where?I wracked my brain. My only personal exposure to iodine had been the radioactivedye from the CT scan years ago when I had all those headaches. Then there wassome vinyl iodine formulation called Povidone, swabbed on my mother’s skin as anantiseptic before a surgery. Where could I look first?I began the field trip in my own home starting with a dusty bottle of Tinctureof Iodine, marked with a skull and cross bones, in the back of our family’soverflowing, remedy-for-anything medicine cabinet. Nobody knew where it camefrom. I also found a milk-glass jar of something called Iodex ointment with alabel looking like it had been designed in the 1950s. My Swedish mother-in-law,Alfhild, swore by Iodex, rubbing it into bruises and sprains. I only kept it inthe cabinet as a keepsake because she was so passionate about her Iodex. Ourfamily medicine chest was all I needed for my first specimens … Two specimens.Not much. Not even enough to fill a small pail, but it was the first step.Since I didn’t know anything about iodine’s beginnings, I could only start atthe present and work backward. Was I qualified to do this research? I’d read abook titled The Historian as Detective in graduate school. It encouragedstudents to do history by collecting “primary sources” and not to accept anycommon hearsay history because it was riddled by bias and the currentgroupthink. “History,” Mr. Sawyer, my high school history teacher told us,“often records only a few events in the lives of great men, not the eventsaround them.”By great, he meant heads of state, generals, officials in charge. By men hemeant, well, males. The rest of the culture was relegated to the margins.Paradoxically, how the majority of the people lived was considered suchinsignificant historical information that it was pushed off into sociology andanthropology, the so-called sideline, “squint” disciplines.The PlanHoward Zinn’s A Peoples’ History of the United States also encourages readers toexcavate and sieve through what they find, to tell an original story.Independent scholars often access information that the rank and file historiansmiss because they are unshackled by the premises of the status quo. Was Iqualified to pursue the history of iodine? There was no way of knowing what thequalifications were since nobody else had done it. No one knew where thebeginning began.Since there was no known history of iodine, I decided to work my way backwardsfrom my own medicine cabinet to the healers of centuries past. I would need toreverse-engineer the journey from the present, backwards in time, to discovereras when iodine was used abundantly. Maybe then I could explore the mystery ofwhy iodine had gone missing during my lifetime.In 2005, I prepared to be a student again. I prepared for an expedition intoiodine’s history. I used the tools that I had learned as a kid: Read what youcan find in the conventional literature. Then, open your eyes and look outsidethe box. Get away from groupthink. Find actual evidence the way the Field Guideinstructed me to learn by digging up specimens and examining them. Get your feetwet and hands dirty, just like those days long ago at the shore: • Prehistoric finds • Ancient Chinese cure books • Egyptian Papyrus • Pharmacy records • Antique medical preparations • Advertising flyers • Personal letters • Iodine lockets • Iodine prostate suppositories • Inhalers • Breast ointments from 1900All these helped me construct a history of how iodine was used, first as aseaweed medicine, then a pharmaceutical.I begin at the current known beginning, 15,000 years ago, but futureanthropologists will no doubt excavate even older evidence of the world’s oldestmedicine.images [../images/00001.jpeg]More Iodine StoriesMeet John: Increased energy, no migraines since starting Iodoral.Here’s what I can report: 1) Increased mental and physical energy. I had more energy within hoursafter the first dose. 2) Greatly reduced migraine headaches. I had been bothered with migrainessince my early teens but they had reduced in intensity sharply in my late 50s toa mere inconvenience. I haven’t really had a headache (that I could identify asa headache) since I started Iodoral just over a year ago. 3) I have tried to get others to try a little IODINE supplementation.None have. I imagine they figure I’m just another ”vitamin nut.”Meet Candace: Depression, lethargy, puffy face resolve.I work as a nurse in an osteopathic physician’s office. I’m 24 and was verydepressed and lethargic. I watched TV in my apartment every night. I kept goingby drinking coffee. Then I saw the doctor was prescribing a lot of iodine in hispractice and the patients were improving. So I tried it on my own. It changed mylife. I’ve lost 30 pounds and a lot of puffiness has left my face. I’m nowdating and don’t understand what was wrong with me that iodine fixed. The doctorthinks it may have been my thyroid or adrenals. I don’t really care. I alwayspanic if I think I may run out of iodine. I don’t want that person I used to be.Meet Samantha: Uterine fibroids, fibrocystic breast disease, not detectibleafter nine months.I am one of those people who have had great success with iodine supplementationto cure uterine fibroids. I use Lugol’s solution, as it has more elementaliodine than plain SSKI which is just potassium iodide. Elemental iodine isreally important for women with uterine fibroids or fibrocystic breast disease(which I also had).I started with 50 mg Lugols per day (6-8 drops) in a glass of water, first thingin the morning. I did have a week or so of detox reaction, but upped the dose to100mg per day, and these detox symptoms passed quickly. In a few weeks I sawdramatic reduction in my FBD, and the uterine fibroids started shrinking.After six months of iodine supplementation most of the FBD was gone, and theuterine fibroids were almost gone.After nine months, I had a breast examination and no FBD could be detected atall, I also had an ultrasound and no uterine fibroids could be detected either.My cycle is now normal, with no pain, and regular as clockwork.Meet Deiter: Atrial fibrillation improvement. No more herpes lip flare-ups.I have been gradually but cautiously increasing number of drops of 5% Lugols,now on four drops per day. I’ve gained over ten pounds, I try liver detox anduse the Magnesium/Salt/Vita C/water/protocol. Only thing I have noticed is asmoother heartbeat, less A-fib episodes and no herpes lip flare-ups. My beardseems fuller.Meet Donna: Energy returns. PMS fatigue gone.I decided to up my Iodoral intake to the full pill from half, for the longweekend off from work. Well, the difference in my energy is astounding. I haveaccomplished a huge amount in my home in the last two days plus got the shoppingdone and am taking care of a very sick husband.I am also in the middle of PMS week, which normally means I would lay around andget nothing done.I am going to stay at this level for at least a week and then go up another halfa pill. I’m not sure I’ll ever go as high as 50 mg, but you never know.Meet Holly: Dry eyes and vaginal dryness helped by iodine.I recently had a two week break from iodine for various (life craziness) reasons… and while I never noticed dry eyes before I started the iodine, I could REALLYnotice the difference during the time I was off iodine.My eyes were dry and somewhat itchy. I started up the iodine again and after acouple of days my eyes returned to normal. I meant to post about it here andtotally forgot (see, I really should be better at taking my iodine! As soon as Istop, my mind and body fall apart)I also notice vaginal dryness when not taking iodine.I recall watching a video link a while back about how iodine affects the body,and it is important for any organ/gland that secretes … so that actually fits,if you think about it. Our eyes constantly need to secrete tiny amounts of fluidto stay lubricated. I don’t know how or why, but somehow iodine helps withmaintaining secretion throughout the body.images [../images/00001.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"Chapter Fourteen [part0005.html#rch14]The Buried History of Iodine [part0005.html#rch14]In solving a problem of this sort, the grand thing is to be able to reasonbackwards. That’s a very useful accomplishment, and a very easy one, but peopledo not practice it much.—Sherlock Holmes in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s A Study in ScarletThe history of iodine is too colorful and complex to lay out in a linear,this-came-first, this-came-next, fashion. There are too many intersectingstories that encompass wars, from the Napoleonic to the Vietnam, too manystories that encompass medical rivalries, wild bootlegging and heartbreakingcases of mental retardation. Iodine has been used on Civil War battlefields andpainted onto swollen breasts. Nobody understands exactly how iodine works butits historical record is “writ” large. Readers will judge how iodine’s longhistory validates our respect for the violet colored element. I’ll hit on thehistory parts that moved me. Take what you want and leave the rest. I’ve put atimeline at the end for those not keen on stories.Before iodine was identified as an element in 1811, the world’s oldest nutrientwas found in its most concentrated form in seaweeds. Algae, another term forseaweed, is believed to be the first anti-oxidant from an evolutionaryperspective.If we go back to prehistoric times, archaeological excavation tells the story ofhow iodine-rich seaweeds were used as both food and medicines. Archaeologicalsites reveal exactly how healers practiced seaweed medicine. Its use stretchesinto the far distant past: • Long before iodine was isolated and discovered as an element in 1811; • Before the 1811 French records showing iodine was extracted fromseaweed; • Before the 3000 year-old Chinese Herbal manual, Pen Tsao; • Before the Egyptian Ebers’ Medical Papyrus; and • Before the recorded Auyurvedic Medicine of India.Digging up a 15,000 Year-Old Seaweed Medicine HutIn 1975, a veterinary student from the Southern University of Chile stumbled onwhat he thought was a cow bone while out for a walk. His discovery turned out tobe a mastodon tusk and contained scrape marks where humans had cut away themeat. This finding launched a 10 year excavation project by archaeologist TomDillehay and his colleagues. They dug and they dug. They picked at the fibers inthe soil with dental picks. They sifted, they radiocarbon dated and then dugsome more. What they discovered was a roughly 15,000 year-old site containing asmall village of huts.Nine seaweed species were found among the plant and animal remains. When thescientists examined the material microscopically, they found all nine specieswere excellent sources of iodine, zinc, hormones and trace elements, as well asprotein. Archaeologists who specialize in the analysis of plants to discover howancient societies organized themselves, participate in the specialized field ofarcheobotany. They discovered that those prehistoric people consumed seaweedswhich regulated cholesterol metabolism, strengthened bones and strengthenedimmune response. The findings show how sophisticated the prehistoric people werewith respect to plant medicine.One of the Monte Verde, Chile village structures was set apart as a “medicinehut” where the seaweeds were prepared. Some specimens were found dried, showingthey had been preserved, and some specimens were burnt in the way later healersused to use seaweed ashes to treat goiter. Eventually the iodine component ofseaweed was identified by the researchers as the most active ingredient. Whatarchaeologists called a “masticated cud” with antibiotic properties was foundwith teeth marks, suggesting one of the ways seaweed was consumed was in theform of a large lozenge that would get the medicine directly into thebloodstream via the blood vessels in the mouth, bypassing digestion.It is known that iodine in its isolated form can irritate the stomach. One mightspeculate this lozenge may have been designed to eliminate the problem; the sameproblem Dr. Guy Abraham solved 15,000 years later by coating his iodine tabletswith a pharmaceutical glaze so they wouldn’t irritate the stomach … Caveman,meet Dr. A.Another striking discovery about the prehistoric Monte Verde inhabitants is thatthey lived in a region rich with plants and animals, but seaweeds were notavailable locally. The nearest seaweeds came from the far distant coast. Nativeswould have needed to walk 90 kilometers west to acquire it from the seacoast orelse find prehistoric trading partners. This information shows how prizedseaweeds were to their culture.From Prehistoric Chile to Vitamin ShoppeAccording to Dillehay’s supporting materials for Monte Verde: Seaweed, Food,Medicine, and the Peopling of South America, some of the excavated seaweeds arestill used today by the indigenous Huilliche people to treat rashes,inflammations, abscesses, tumors, ulcers, eye infections, gout and otherconditions. I found Gigartina, one of the seaweeds found at the Monte Verdesite, in capsules in the Vitamin Shoppe chain store. Research shows this redseaweed has been used for millennia as an immune stimulant and antiviral intraditional Chinese medicine as well as other cultures. Many contemporarynaturopaths and herbalists recommend Gigartina, unaware that 15,000 years agoprehistoric peoples used the exact same botanical.Fast forward ten centuries. Written history actually documents seaweeds asmedicine. Herbal medicine books were among the first books produced, written byhand, in ancient China, Egypt, India and Europe. Most often such writings werecreated on manuscript “paper” or scrolls and recorded the traditional medicalpractices. They were often accompanied by drawings so the reader could identifythe right plant.The Emperor Shennong is credited with the founding of Chinese herbal medicine,but most likely he only possessed the foresight to record traditional remedieswhich had been passed along by word of mouth through the generations. They wererecorded in the Pen Ts’ao ching or Great Herbal pharmacopoeia in about 2700 BCE.Hai Tsao, one of the seaweeds found at the Monte Verde site, also is listed inthe ancient Chinese herbal as a treatment for tumors, goiter and tuberculosis.Laminaria, a brown seaweed, was recommended for tumors then and is still studiedby scientists 3,000 years later.The famous Ebers Medical Papyrus was reportedly found between the legs of amummy in an Egyptian burial ground. When the 110 page scroll was finallytranslated into English by an Egyptian endocrinologist in 1987, the manuscriptrevealed that the Egyptians used seaweeds for breast tumors. The ancient IndianAyurvedic medicine employed seaweed as well. The Materia Medica, a compilationof medical remedies, reports the same information, showing seaweed was auniversally known remedy for everything from tumors to parasites for millennia.Goiter was sometimes referred to as “fat neck.” Hippocrates, the ancient Greekphilosopher known as the father of Western medicine, widely known for authoringthe oath, “First do no harm,” also prescribed seaweed. Hippocrates made medicinea discipline distinct from philosophy but maintained philosophy’s imperative tolook for errors in reasoning within medicine. He urged meticulous documenting ofall clinical observations as well as taking elaborate case histories of thewhole person. These holistic practices, which were the standard of care inAncient Greece, mostly died out after his death. But at least he passed on thetradition of treating the thyroid with seaweed to his many followers.Later, in the 1st century AD, naturalist Pliny the Elder recommended copiousburnt seaweed as a sure remedy for “neck swelling.” In the Middle Ages there issome reference to the healers Galen and Avicenna, recommending the same remedy.So it’s hard to know if the remedy was discovered in one place and spread, or ifit was independently discovered in so many places, seaweeds as medicine werecommon knowledge in different pockets around the globe.The Native Healer Known as Seaweed ManSometimes, western explorers or missionaries stumbled onto seaweed medicine.When the Lutheran missionaries attempted to convert the aboriginal people ofAustralia in the 1800s, they built a village and tried to “civilize” thenatives. But the locals still retained faith in their medicine man—called“parraityeorn”—which translated into “seaweed man.”But seaweed knowledge eluded some. When British whaling ships went out onexpeditions lasting as long as three years, they would often report with disgustthat some primitive peoples ate seaweed. As many as a third of the whalers diedof scurvy, unaware that vitamin C was there for the taking in the seaweedfloating around their ship.images [../images/00001.jpeg]More Iodine StoriesMeet Brittany: Severe fibromyalgia pain and fatigue resolve.I’m a 28 year–old woman with three active kids. I developed fibromyalgia in myupper back after the birth of my first child in 2003. The pain and spasmsprogressed into deep throbbing pain within three years and after my secondchild. Spasms have gotten so bad and so frequent that I fear them. The longestone lasted 14 hours and put me in the ER. When it was over, I threw upeverywhere, slept for a week and lost 10 pounds. My most recent spasm was about6 months ago. They tend to last about two to three hours but can last longer.Sometimes I went months without them and then there are months I have them everyweek. When I say spasms, think of having the wind knocked out of you while beingcrushed by a truck and someone twisting a knife in and out of your shoulderblade. It was that bad. I felt like a 70 year-old trapped in a thirty-year oldbody.My fatigue was so severe, I fell asleep while driving. As soon as I got up inthe morning, putting on clothes was a chore. Even though I had love in my life,and children and a wonderful husband, I don’t understand how I lived so manyyears feeling so miserable and NO ONE HELPED ME! Doctors are so careless! Igained 20 pounds in six months doing nothing different. My skin was getting bad.Dry but breaking out.I had to take Tramodol prescription pain killer. Then, in looking upfibromyalgia on the web, I came across iodine as a therapy. It seemed cheapenough, so the first thing I did was apply some Lugol’s Iodine to my foot. ThenI started taking it orally. Everything changed. One day I realized I forgot totake my pain meds.Within two weeks of starting iodine, I feel like I have gotten my life back. Ifeel ashamed to have lived in a stupor like a zombie for so long, just trying toget by each day. Even in the midst of detox symptoms, I have done more in twoweeks than I have in the last year! I feel awesome! I LOVE life! I am losinginches, not weight yet, but who cares!? I have apologized profusely to myhusband for being so sick and lazy and thanked him for loving me so much. Hebasically took care of me and three kids for the last three years as I had beenprogressively getting worse.Even though I am so happy now, I want to cry for my old self and the yearswasted. I want to help those around me. I see obese women and tired men and feelso bad for them. I want to help! I’m awake and alive! I’m even smarter. Now Irealize that it is not healthy to accept life-deteriorating health just due toaging. A 60-year-old shouldn’t have ever felt the way I did.Are there any other young moms out there who can relate to my story? My doctoralso gave me anti-anxiety meds and wanted to put me on antidepressants.Now I come home from work and get right down to making dinner for the family. Inow have so much energy I could make two dinners every night!Meet Sonja: Bleeding gums resolve.My greatest iodine success is curing long-time bleeding gums. I had irritatedgums between two teeth for over a year, even with the gentlest flossing. Mydentist did what she could, but my gums didn’t heal. I got a prescriptionmouthwash—which I used for two months without it helping at all. I even thoughtat some time that my tooth may have a hidden crack because of the pain.After a while, I thought about trying Lugol’s 5% on the problem area. Just onedrop mornings and evenings after flossing. After one week, I was significantlybetter. I found expanding floss which, after a little use, lost the originalwaxing of the thread. I then soaked part of the floss and used it once morebetween in the problem areas. After just one more week, the gums had healed andwere healthy once more—after well over a year of suffering. I’ve stopped theiodine treatment (the iodine flossing) and now just take my iodine the regularway—2 drops in water in the morning and one drop in the evening. I sometimesswish the solution, but I don’t do any topical treatment any more. And my gumsare still healthy.I still keep up the iodine (+ selenium). I have Hashimoto’s and have notregistered any adverse effect of iodine. My TSH may have increased a little, butso have fT4 and fT3 (so much for the “reliable TSH”!) and my energy levels.images [../images/00001.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"Chapter Fifteen [part0005.html#rch15]A Magic Purple Haze—Iodine Emerges from the Ashes—Its Discovery as an Element[part0005.html#rch15]We shall not cease from explorationAnd the end of all our exploringWill be to arrive where we startedAnd know the place for the first time.—T.S. Eliot, Four QuartetsNo one could invent a story as magical as the true story. The discovery ofiodine as a life-changing chemical element happened the way a magician pours amysterious liquid into a top hat and then, in a cloud of sparkles, poof, pullsout a white rabbit. For years, medicine had known seaweed had healing powers butnobody knew why. Then in 1811, a chemical accident transformed Western medicine.French chemist Bernard Courtois had worked in the family manufacturing businessin Dijon making saltpeter, an ingredient used to make gunpowder for Napolean’swars. One day Courtois ran out of the customary wood ash, so he acquired seaweedwhich was abundant on the shores of Normandy and Brittany. He burned seaweed ina copper vessel, and then accidentally poured too much sulfuric acid onto theashes. Whoosh, a beautiful violet vapor emerged. The vapor crystallized into aluminous powder the color of graphite.Then and there, Courtois suspected he had discovered a new element but was toopoor to experiment, so he gave his wealthier chemist friends samples of thecrystals for experimentation. He didn’t realize that extra sulfuric acid createdone of the most fortuitous accidents in medical history.Two years later, Humphrey Davy sent a letter to the Royal Society of Londonnaming the new element Iodes, the Greek word for violet. Later in the 1800s,many scientific “fathers” claimed a role in iodine’s conception. Courtois, wholaunched the revolution of scientific discovery died penniless because he didn’tregister his discovery.In the next few years, iodine was picked up by physicians for the treatment ofmany diseases. Since burnt seaweed and sea sponges had often been used to treatgoiter for thousands of years, doctors in England and Europe began to make theconnection that it was actually the iodine in these sea plants that shrunk thesick, swollen thyroids of goiter. Word spread fast. Thousands of articles werepublished. Reports documented too many diseases to count with accuracy in thefollowing years.1820 to 1900—Iodine Goes ViralLung diseases were the scourge of Europe in the 1900s. Patients who had oftenrecovered by surrounding their hospital beds with seaweed, now took iodine.In 1829, Jean Lugol, a Paris doctor, first invented a popular iodine formulationknown as Lugol’s Solution which contained 5% iodine and 10% potassium iodidemixed with distilled water. It was first created for the lungs, but over theyears, it has been used for everything from purifying water to treating thyroidconditions. As the 1800s passed, iodine became what has been called “the SwissArmy Knife of Medicine.”According to Francis C. Kelly, writing in the Proceedings of the Royal Societyof Medicine, 1961, “The variety of diseases for which iodine was prescribed inthe early years is astonishing—paralysis, chorea, scrofula, lacrimal fistula,deafness, distortions of the spine, hip joint disease, syphilis, acuteinflammation, gout, gangrene, dropsy, carbuncles, whitlow, chilblains, burns,scalds, croup, catarrh, asthma, ulcers and bronchitis—to mention only a few.” Hereports there that between 1820 and 1840, many publications appeared documentingthe various applications.images [../images/00001.jpeg]Albert Szentgorgi, the 1937 Nobel Prize winner credited with the discovery ofVitamin C, claimed doctors in his era had a saying about potassium iodide (KI):If you know not where or why, use you then K and I.images [../images/00001.jpeg]We often forget that syphilis infected 50 percent of Europe in the late 1800s.When Van Gogh contracted syphilis, he wrote a letter to his brother, Theo, onhow iodine helped the brain and the spine. We don’t know what form he used inturn-of-the-century France, but we do know Bismuth Formic Iodide Compound wasavailable at American pharmacies to combat syphilitic lesions. Toxic mercury wasused until it was replaced by potassium iodide in 1840 for the later stages ofsyphilis and was used until 1929 when Penicillin was invented. In reviewingpharmacy ledgers from that era, I found thousands of iodine-based compoundsprescribed by doctors for lesions.1800s The Breasts Love IodineDoctors advised women to paint their painful and cystic breasts with iodine.Some breast cancer doctors injected iodine directly into the breasts or ovariesfor swelling and cysts. Iodine was used in hundreds of breast cancer casestudies reported by famed surgeon Dr. Alfred Valpeau in his A Treatise on Cancerof the Breast and of the Mammary Region (1856).You would think the records of disease and treatments would be presented in adry or academic fashion. But 150 years ago, case studies were written up withmeticulous and compassionate care. Doctors reflected on their options and sharedboth their optimism and restraint, their enthusiasm and disappointment. Aniodine medical industry grew, developing new ways to administer iodine. Manydrug companies developed their own formulations combining iodine with otherelements.Patients caught on and reported their successes. In collecting artifacts andiodine memorabilia for the Breast Cancer Choices research project, I purchasedan antique letter for sale, dated May 31, 1886. Addressed to “Mrs. Dr. R. A.Johnston” in Wellsville, Ohio, it came from her sister. The letter writerdescribed how she had successfully relieved pain by painting iodine on herbreast the way the doctor’s wife had recommended. What is significant is thatthis letter provided insight into successful patient-to-patient medicine in thelate 1800s, and that the many monographs and books published by medical doctorson iodine and the breast did not constitute fad, hype or hyperbole. The patientsreported success to each other.The American Civil War—The Iodine Cure for CannonballsIn 2006, while cruising eBay for iodine artifacts, I stumbled on a brass iodinecanteen with markings indicating it was used by the Confederate soldiers duringthe Civil War. I later discovered soldiers carried iodine canteens along withwater canteens as an essential part of their pack. Iodine was used to purifywater and to treat infections from unsanitary conditions or even thecomplications of battlefield surgeries and gunshot wounds. Long after I hadsnared the canteen for Breast Cancer Choices’ iodine artifact collection, I readthe report by Francis Kelly of a Confederate soldier who might have used such acanteen.image [../images/00006.jpeg]Kelly recalls the story of a Confederate Colonel, John B. Gordon, who sustainedseveral cannonball injuries to his leg, arm, shoulder and face. Infection setin. When he was removed to a hospital, Dr. Weatherly of the 6th Alabama Regimentprescribed Tincture of Iodine applied to the wounds three or four times a day.Gordon claims his wife may have misunderstood the instructions and applied theiodine three or four hundred times a day. The Colonel not only recovered, bewent on to become Governor of Georgia and lived a long life. He died in 1904,forty years after his Civil War experience.images [../images/00001.jpeg]Soldiers carried iodine canteens along with water canteens as an essential partof their pack.images [../images/00001.jpeg]Iodine: The Infection ConnectionToday we know that iodine’s effects are broader than its antiseptic properties.We have learned that it detoxifies metals, strengthens the endocrine system andhas unexplained mechanisms of action in the brain and other body systems.At the turn of the 20th century, iodine was so popular for lung diseases, thatmedical catalogs featured elaborate devices called nebulizers; they wereintended to promote inhalation according to certain documented protocols. Iodinesometimes drove toxins from the lungs so powerfully that care was needed to slowdown the detoxification process. Dr. Abraham uses the word, “deobstruent,” todescribe the process of driving toxins and impurities from the blood andtissues. Iodine was widely believed to prevent viral infection. The British RedCross even manufactured lockets embedded with iodine-soaked cotton.image [../images/00007.jpeg]Iodizing Salt Takes 100 Years (no, that’s not a typo)Even though French nutritional chemist Jean-Baptiste Bousingalt had recommendedadding iodine to salt in 1830s, it took Dr. David Marine until 1924 to get saltiodized in the United States. He achieved this feat by creating an experiment onadolescents from Akron, Ohio, where the soil was notoriously iodine deficient.Goiter affected 56 percent of the population and girls were six times morelikely to develop goiter than boys. Researchers took approximately 2,000 pupilsand gave them iodide. The control group of approximately the same number ofpupils received no iodide. After 30 months, 22 percent of the students not giveniodide developed goiter. Only two percent of the students receiving iodidedeveloped goiter.In less than ten years after salt was iodized, goiter incidence plummeted. InDetroit, goiter rates dropped from 9.7 percent to 1.4 percent in the first sixyears of using iodized salt.Soldier, Your Neck Is Too FatScholars such as Quynh Nguyen observed, in Iodized Salt and US Development, thatbefore the iodization of salt, the US Army rejected many “Goiter Belt” recruitsfor significant goiter. During the First World War nearly 12,000 men had simplegoiter and one third of those were rejected because their necks were so largethe military shirts’ collars could not be fastened. Even soldiers accepted intothe army tended to have larger necks than soldiers elsewhere and needed largershirts. After salt iodization, fewer Goiter Belt recruits were rejected and theArmy began making shirts with smaller collars.By the 1900s the benefits of iodine as an important nutrient even penetratedrural communities of South Carolina. There they were so proud of theiriodine-rich soil they marketed bootleg liquor with the slogan, “Not a goiter ina gallon.” In order to further advertise their healthy produce, SOUTH CAROLINA,THE IODINE STATE, was stamped on license plates.But not every place in the world is lucky enough to have a Seaweed Man as thelocal healer or a state as rich in iodine soil as South Carolina. Many countriesand areas are devastated by iodine deficiency. In 1996, China was estimated tohave ten million people suffering from mental retardation because of iodinedeficiency in the soil.image [../images/00008.jpeg]In 1989, when pediatric neurologist Dr. G. Robert DeLong of Duke UniversityMedical School first visited the rural Chinese province Xinjiang, mentalretardation was severe. Other disabilities also prevailed: miscarriages, highinfant mortality, stunted growth, deafness and stillbirths affected much of thepopulation.Some of the fully developed adults appeared as small as children. Some of thefive year-olds looked like toddlers. According to DeLong, the children weretruly in sad shape. “Some showed extreme mental retardation and could not walk,stand or even sit. Even the ones without severe signs of physical debilitationwere slack and dull-eyed.”Their livestock were similarly feeble and produced stillborn offspring, leavingthe province desperately poor. Since this area of China had been regarded asinhabited by “village idiots” since Marco Polo’s time in the 1200s, the peoplehad been “written off.” Iodized salt was not an option because of many culturaland political factors including fear of the salt.Dr. DeLong and his colleagues in China explored and rejected many solutions forgetting iodine into the people. Finally, DeLong looked at the irrigation ditchesand wondered if iodine could be dripped into the water. That way the plantswould absorb the iodine, the animals would eat the plants and the people on topof the food chain would get enough iodine.How did they do this? They had to be practical. Think low tech. DeLong and hisChinese colleagues rigged a common 55 gallon oil drum on top of a rickety bridgethat crossed the irrigation canal. They attached some intravenous tubing andclamps to provide a steady drip into the water. Next, they filled the drum withpotassium iodate and measured how much iodine turned up in the downstreamvillages. When they were ready, they hired a local villager to guard the barrelfrom theft. At night he slept on the bridge, rolled up in a blanket. As theiodine ran out, the villagers continued to refill the barrels.image [../images/00009.jpeg]How to Drop Infant Mortality by HalfA year later, • Infant mortality dropped by half. • Sheep production increased 40 percent. • Later measurements showed the average five-year-old’s height increasedby four inches. • The average intelligence of children born after the irrigation projectincreased 16 IQ points. • Stillborn animals and miscarriage were reduced by 50 percent.By 1997, The Thrasher Foundation, The Joseph P. Kennedy Foundation and KiwanisInternational jumped in to underwrite the irrigation project. Iodine dripping isnow implemented for 2.6 million Chinese. Thirteen and one-half tons of iodinehave been dripped into the villagers’ water. The cost for such a life saving,life altering project? Less than six cents per person. That’s all it cost torewrite the lives of people who had been written off for five centuries.In Kazakhstan, a country located in Central Asia, public health officials tryhard to raise awareness about the importance of iodine to intelligence.Billboards shout out the iodine message. Pamphlets are distributed and studiedby seventh graders. Even the Iodine Man super hero cartoon character urgeschildren not to be stupid; “eat iodized salt.” Even with all these educationaltools, Valentina Sivryukova, president of the national confederation of Kazakhcharities, was never sure the message got through until, while walking throughthe market one day, she heard one young Kazakh boy tease another, calling out,“What are you, iodine-deficient or something?”What Difference Does 15 IQ Points Make?In Zaire, public health workers travelled to remote areas where mentalretardation was so devastating that they felt the best way to get iodine intothe population was to inject them with iodine in a base of poppy seed oil. Inone case, an adult man whose IQ was estimated to be in the 50s, was so mentallyimpaired from iodine deficiency, that he didn’t understand he needed to wearclothes. His aging parents were so ashamed that they had to keep him locked inthe house so as not to upset the villagers. After the public health workers gavehim an injection of iodine mixed with poppy seed oil, he learned to keep hisclothes on and was able to get a job loading bricks onto a truck. This not onlyhelped the family finances but their status in their village. The parents wereamong many who walked many miles to thank the public health workers for changingtheir lives.Unfortunately, it has been hard to create awareness that iodine is not just aconcern for poor countries where mass mental retardation or Cretinism presents ahuge health problem. Countries such as India are so serious about the importanceof iodized salt that you can go to jail if you’re caught transporting or sellingcontraband uniodized salt.So here we are at the beginning of the 21st century. If iodine deficiency is theleading cause of mental retardation and if iodine can reverse breast disease andmany other medical conditions, why don’t we know more about it? Why do we thinkof iodine as that little bottle with skull and cross bones in the medicinecabinet? When did iodine information disappear from medical schools and medicallibraries? Why?Who stole iodine?images [../images/00001.jpeg] images [../images/00001.jpeg]Iodine-based Medicine Time Line15,000 BC Monte Verde archaeological site reveals “medical hut” with seaweedmedicines. 2,700 BCE Chinese Pen Tao famous herbal pharmacopoeia documentsseaweed for goiter and tumors. 1550 BCE Eber’s Papyrus Egyptian MedicalDocuments use of seaweed for breast cancer. 460 BC Hippocrates, the founder ofModern Medicine recommends seaweed for goiter. 100 AD Pliny the Elder,naturalist, lawyer, philosopher, promotes using burnt seaweed for goiter. 400 ADSeaweeds used by Chinese physician Ke-Hung for goiter.

Manypublications follow, as lung disease was prevalent in Europe. Iodine inhalationdevices and inhalation lockets appeared. 1821 As part of the new French pharmacymovement, Francois Magendie added Iodine to a pharmacopoeia.

Kelleyaddresses the Royal Society of Medicine, lamenting the passing of Iodine out offashion: And what of the future? Who can tell how the reputations of iodinetoday will stand 100 years hence? To venture an opinion based on the events ofthe past, I can only say that the process of research, reevaluation,reappraisal, refinement will go on, and that in the year 2061 some iodine meritsthat enjoy contemporary favor will plainly appear ephemeral, while new merits asyet hidden from us will assuredly have declared themselves. We may safely leaveit to our successors to share the surprises that time has yet in store. 2000 F.Guy Abraham, MD, initiates a research project on iodine deficiency, reviewingthe history of iodine research. 2005 “The Wolff-Chaikoff Effect: Crying Wolf?”by Guy E.

The informationthat I found here has helped me so much! I learned a lot by reading how peoplereacted to taking iodine and how they dealt with the detox. Thank you all somuch! So, here’s my story.I have been hypothyroid since I was 24. It started really slowly: just tirednessat first. After five years or so, I started to become emotionally unstable. Iwas paranoid, frightened, scared and unhappy. A friend said to me: “You’realways tired.” And I was. Still, I didn’t really realize how much more tired Iwas than any healthy person should be. The decline was so gradual.I got worse and worse … I was in a lot of pain. Everything hurt. My joints, mymuscles, my insides, everything. And I was always sooo tired. I didn’t want todo anything. Not go to birthdays, no walks, no nothing.Symptoms:Allergies (hay fever, mites allergy, cannot tolerate perfume, suspectedHashimoto’s); bad candida infection (vagina, gut and mouth); menstrual pains(uterus, lower back radiating to whole back and shoulders and neck); outereyebrows gone; burn easily in the sun, hearing is bad especially in groups;tinnitis; bad memory (short term and long term): I cannot leave a pan on thestove and go do something else: it burns; tremors in eye lid; slow thinking: Icould not follow a conversation/movie/book; cannot concentrate; underside offeet hurt; all joints feel like they are burning; gut hurt (even worse whenpressed); the slightest physical exercise or house work results in rapidheartbeat, profuse sweating, red face, muscle pain and inflamed tendons;ganglion on back of hand; pain in left knee (other than the burning sensation);nose and throat tonsils and lungs inflamed at a regular basis (once a month);weight gain (my heaviest was 95 kilos); cannot tolerate carbs (not even fullgrain, not even beans); out of breath after taking three steps on the stairs;cold sore on lower lip (has been so big as to reach my jawbone); depression.During that period, I went to a doctor a few times. He told me to just take itmore slowly.At the age of 34, I weighed 95 kilos {209 pounds], was always tired, wasbloated, in pain all the time, couldn’t tolerate any carbs (by then I was onAtkins because carbs made my heart race and made me feel as if I would die),couldn’t think straight, was unreasonable and had dark clouds in my head (that’swhat the depression felt like).I again went to a doctor (I had just moved, so it was a different one thistime). He again told me to take it easy. I replied that, if I took it any moreeasy than I was doing now, I might as well go and lay in my coffin right away. Istarted to cry out of frustration (first time I did that; I never cried).Probably to get rid of me he “allowed” me to have my blood tested. When theresults came back, it was clear that I was hypothyroid. I was so relieved thatthey found something (little did I know).At the age of 34, I was placed on thyroid hormone, T4 only. This doctor knewvery little about thyroid illnesses and put me on a high dose immediately. Ifelt extremely ill from that: I couldn’t walk a mile. Any exertion would make mebreathless, and in extreme pain. At that point, I could not work anymore. Myboss at the time was very understanding (until then, I hadn’t called in sickvery often, I simply went to bed straight out of work). I couldn’t work for awhole year. I just lay on the couch or in bed and felt miserable.After a year, I felt about as bad as I did before I started the T4. I startedworking again. Still had to get to bed as soon as I got home. I read a lot aboutHypo-T and decided I wanted to try the desiccated form of thyroid meds. Mydoctor said that those kinds of meds were too unreliable. So then I asked to beallowed to take T3 instead (alongside the T4). He thought that was nonsense too.But this time I was determined and I asked to be sent to a specialist (inHolland you have to have a referral). I had researched to which doctor I wantedto go, and he relented. The specialist thought T3 was nonsense too, but gave itto me anyway.The T3 gave me back my capacity to think. It also made me feel less cold. Thefirst time I took T3, some kind of electric pulse shot to my toes, fingers andhead. It helped a lot. The other symptoms remained though …Through the years I had to up my T4 from 100 mcg to 137 mcg. My TSH was nolonger measurable. Doc said I was hyper. I disagreed and said I was hypo. Istill had the classic signs of hypo (cold, …) and none of the hyper.My list of symptoms was still the same and I got progressively worse. I wouldget ill every month. It always started with my nose tonsils, then the throattonsils, and then my lungs. I would be rid of it only one week in the month. Itexhausted me. I also still had the tiredness, the pain in my joints, the fog inmy brain (better after T3, but not resolved. I had to be in bed by 20:00 andsleep to 06:30 to not get sick and have a little energy.I always kept reading a lot about hypo-T, hoping to find something I could domyself. And to be honest: to get out of the grip of my GP, who was trying to getme to lower my T4.I discovered I had mercury poisoning when someone suggested mercury could be aproblem. I started taking selenium for that. Selenium made me feel happier andthink more clearly. Reading about mercury poisoning led me to iodine. I startedtaking kelp, but it didn’t do much for me. Then I found Curezone in October,2011.In November, 2011, I started on Lugol’s Iodine. I took 50 mg twice a day. I gothyper, and I lowered my T4 dose accordingly. The effect was temporary though,and I upped to the original dose again (back to 137 mcg). This was such adisappointment! Then I read Dr. Brownstein’s book where he said that it mighttake up to three years to see any significant improvement in the thyroid. So Ihad to be patient (which I am not)). I also started to gain weight.My candida really hated the Lugol’s (and because of that I loved it). I alsotook the companion supplements.After reading a lot on Curezone, I decided to up my iodine by taking SKII. Now Itook 100 mg of Lugol’s and 50 mg of SKII. Again I got hyper, lowered my T4. Thistime I didn’t need to up it back! I was now on 125 mcg/day T4. I also still takemy T3. I don’t lower that, it has a half-time of a day, whereas the T4 has ahalf-time of a week.28th Feb 2012: I am now on 150 mg Lugol’s and 300 mg SKII daily. A lot ishappening to my body:Spots on my hands are disappearing. My allergies are gone. Pain in left knee isabout half as bad as it used to be. Losing weight, but more than that: my bodyis starting to look different. Face is not puffy anymore. My muscle strength iscoming back. I’m soooo much happier! My head is wonderfully clear. My feet donot hurt anymore. Heart rate has gone down (except when I’m hyper, of course). Ilove going on a visit now. I have much more energy, and when I get tired, I justsit down for 15 minutes, and then I’m ready to go again. When hypo-T, restingdidn’t make any difference. Joints don’t burn anymore. Tonsillitis is muchbetter, but not resolved. I walked up a hill last week with my husband, and Icould keep up with him without even panting or my heart racing!Remaining symptoms:Menstrual pains (just read here that might be a B12 deficiency. I just orderedthe Dr. Brownstein’s B 12 book). I get horrible pains in my lower back andshoulders. These pains stay for about a week after the bleeding has stopped. Istill have intermittent bleeding too. I think my candida is almost undercontrol. I still get the rapid heartbeats sometimes and still cannot toleratecarbs. Short term memory still bad. Gut still hurts. Diarrhea often.So, a lot is better, but I’m not there yet. But then, I’ve been ill for morethan 15 years now, and I’ve only been on Iodine for four months!

[part0005.html#rch16]The beginning of wisdom is found in doubting; by doubting we come to thequestion, by seeking we may come upon the truth.—Pierre Abelard, French philosopherAfter World War II, the invention of penicillin and sulfa drugs began to replaceiodine for infections. But the invention of antibiotics doesn’t explain why acentury of non-infection uses of iodine gradually lost favor, as if all the oldbooks and articles were buried. My late mother-in-law’s jar of Iodex Ointmentwas no longer available at Walgreens. Doctors began to know iodine only as asurgical antiseptic or an ingredient in radioactive contrast dyes. Mostnon-doctors of my generation only remember iodine as that little brown bottle inthe medicine chest emblazoned with a skull and cross bones.images [../images/00001.jpeg]Where did the wealth of iodine information from the medical books and monographsgo? Why did it disappear?images [../images/00001.jpeg]Remember, we are talking about a huge list of conditions from prostatitus togoiter to allergies. Iodine couldn’t suddenly stop working after a hundredyears. Some other forces must have contributed to the disappearance of iodineinformation. How could Iodine go from being used for dozens of medicalconditions to being considered a poison? How could this happen? What turned theworld against iodine?Who stole iodine? In 2005, Guy Abraham, MD, wrote an article that answered thatquestion. The Wolff-Chaikoff Effect: Crying Wolff, identified an influentialpaper published in 1948 which persuaded physicians that iodine was dangerous andwould stop the thyroids of iodine-takers from working.Dr. Abraham points out that the authors made a mistake by claiming iodine causedgoiter in rats at 20 times the recommended daily allowance (RDA). They, in fact,had not even bothered to check the rats’ thyroid hormone level and reported noevidence of enlarged thyroid or disease.The Wolff-Chaikoff AssumptionThis mistaken conclusion was repeated by Wolff again in 1969 when another paperextrapolated the findings to humans. Meanwhile one of the authors, Dr. Wolff,moved from U C Berkeley to the National Institutes of Health, inflating theimportance of the study. The influence of Wolff-Chaikoff conclusions were sowide, the phenomenon was institutionalized by calling the fear-mongering event,“The Wolff-Chaikoff Effect.” Medical textbooks perpetuated this mistake andtaught it to at least three generations of doctors.images [../images/00001.jpeg]No one ever fact-checked or replicated the study, so its warning to avoid iodinesupplementation was incorporated into medical practice.images [../images/00001.jpeg]A moratorium on human iodine research ensued. I‘d read about the legendaryWolff-Chaikoff Effect in sources from textbooks to Wikipedia. But I had neverpersonally heard anyone invoke Wolff-Chaikoff as a prophecy of doom that iodinewould make them terribly sick.Then at 8 o’clock one March morning, my phone rang. It was a Connecticut doctorsaying that a patient who was in our Iodine Investigative Project database wassitting in his office. Her TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) was out of thelaboratory range, and he was terrified she had become desperately hypothyroidfrom taking iodine. He shared:Barbara has always had an intuitive sense of what works for her, which is whyI’m calling you before taking her off iodine.I asked if she had any other indications of being hypothyroid and he said, “No,she never looked or felt better.”In answering, I paraphrased a paper written by Dr. Jorge Flechas on why TSHlevels may appear abnormal on iodine supplementation, but those anomalies areunlikely to reflect hypothyroidism.“Miss Farrow, it is a fundamental law of physiology that iodine shuts down thethyroid.”I let the words settle in my ears because I had never heard the disastrousWolff-Chaikoff Effect legacy articulated so bluntly.I referred him to Dr. Abraham’s article on Wolff-Chaikoff and said I would faxhim Dr. Flechas’ paper explaining the TSH levels. As an afterthought, I added,“Would you please email me back to let me know your thoughts?” He agreed. Amonth later, he emailed me thanking me for the heads up on Wolff-Chaikoff, TSHlevels and the introduction to Dr. Abraham’s online Iodine Project library.Hearing the chilling pronouncement from a doctor so well-meaning that he wouldcall a non-doctor for information made an impression on me. The disastrouslegacy of Wolff-Chaikoff wasn’t buried in a medical library anymore. It wasalive and well in Connecticut and probably everywhere else. The notion that“iodine shuts down the thyroid gland” was still enforced as a “fundamental lawof physiology” and still actively practiced. Except that it turned out to bewrong—neither fundamental nor a law. Just an assumption from an influence-leaderwith credentials from UC Berkeley and the National Institutes of Health. The“They must know what they’re doing” mindset prevailed and soon there was amoratorium on further iodine research on humans. Sound crazy? Yes, but verytrue!images [../images/00001.jpeg]If iodine could be stolen from needy patients for decades by two unverifiedscientific papers, we must blame a medical system that allows unverified studiesto determine patient care.images [../images/00001.jpeg]Yes, that’s an accusation. How could this fiasco happen? Isn’t anybody payingattention? How many people have been harmed by the theft of iodine from medicalpractice? Me? You? Our children?The most important scientific revolutions all include, as their only commonfeature, the dethronement of human arrogance from one pedestal after of previousconviction about the centrality in the cosmos.—Stephen Jay GouldThe Abraham Challenge Creates a RevolutionDr. Abraham, a former Professor of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Endocrinology atthe UCLA School of Medicine, did not keep his findings to himself. He continuedto publish more on iodine deficiency and enlisted the partnership of twoextraordinary physicians in clinical practice, Jorge Flechas, MD, of NorthCarolina, and David Brownstein, MD, of Michigan. Since 2005, the threepassionate, committed doctors produced a body of work that has created arevolution in existing assumptions about iodine.Why? Because their work has been tested as tried and true by an inestimablenumber of patients and doctors over the last seven years.If this information had come out 20 years ago, the revolution in iodine thinkingwould not have occurred. There was no Internet 20 years ago. No sophisticatedpatient-to-patient network. No rapid communications between physicians.The Iodine Doctors’ claims about the benefits of iodine supplementation couldhave remained an issue quietly discussed at medical conferences. Best case,iodine might have been used by a small group of thinking doctors for its mostpopular benefits, or it could have just faded without a trace. The resultingpatient outcome may have been of high quality but limited by: • The few iodine literate doctors; and • The fact that these doctors could be open to criticism and thus wouldtreat conservatively in dosing iodine. The true benefits of iodine could havelanguished for another twenty years.But the Iodine doctors went out into the medical community and spoke aboutiodine deficiency at conferences. They cited case after case from breast diseaseto insulin reduction to depression. Patient activists attending these eventsreported back to their online communities. They enlisted their peers to helpthem investigate. They read all of Dr. Abraham’s articles and checked hiscitations. They listened to Dr. Flechas’ radio interviews. They read Dr.Brownstein’s book. The communities like Breast Cancer Choices set out toinvestigate the information by researching iodine’s historical benefits as wellas the mysterious politics of iodine-based medicine.These communities set out to determine the validity of iodine usage: Was itsafe? If it was, what diseases and conditions could be benefited by it? Or, wasit unsafe? Was there a supplement that was readily available that could dowidespread good right under our noses. What were the facts? What was thefiction?images [../images/00001.jpeg]The Iodine Revolution contains two interdependent parts, the original thinkerand the grass roots movement which proved Dr. Abraham right.images [../images/00001.jpeg]As online participants are mostly anonymous, challenges to the pro-iodineinformation came fast, encouraging competition to get at the facts. By 2006, thefirst online groups sprang up with the exclusive purpose of investigatingiodine. Zoe, a former psychology professor, established The Yahoo Iodine Groupwhich was later taken over by Stephanie Buist, ND. The Curezone Iodine Forum,created by Steve Wilson, Laura Olsson and Chris E. Vulcanel, started almostsimultaneously. Their memberships caught fire as good results and excitementgrew. Predictably, several Internet pundits predicted all the iodine-takerswould be dead in six months from the legendary and widely held/practiced beliefin the Wolff-Chaikoff Effect.But the pro-iodine participants continued experimenting, supporting each otherand collecting testimonials. Some pro-iodine-thought leaders had medical orscience backgrounds, so they weighed the evidence in the iodine medicalliterature. Laura Olsson became a tireless historian-anthropologist of iodine’suse. Her blog records much valuable information that would be lost to historywithout her research. See: http://iodinehistory.blogspot.com[http://www.iodinehistory.blogspot.com]. Excitement grew as new information wasrapidly shared and rechecked. Clearly, Wolff-Chaikoff would never have gottenpast these patient-to-patient Internet investigators.Solidarity and respect grew between the various online forums and webmasters aswe all learned from each other. Doctors in clinical practice began to learn fromthe patients’ information exchange. Breast Cancer Choices kept track of many ofthe informed Iodine Practitioners and compiled their contact information in aninternational Iodine Literate Practitioners Directory.The Iodine Revolution: The Iodine Movement Steals Back Iodine from ObscurityAn apparently arbitrary element, compounded of personal or historical accident,is always a formative ingredient of the beliefs espoused by a given scientificcommunity at a given time.”—T. S. Kuhn, The Structure of Scientific RevolutionsIn 1980, more patients were more likely to follow the status quo because medicalinformation was monopolized by credentialed practitioners and access to medicalinformation was limited. By 2005, the Internet had overthrown the monopoly onmedical information via a variety of resources, starting with the references atPubmed.com [http://www.Pubmed.com], the online database of the National Libraryof Medicine, which became available to all.Within a couple of years, Google digitized old medical books scanned fromlibraries around the world, creating a bounty for research. Old newspapers andmagazines were now searchable. Such resources fueled brainstorming bypatient-to-patient groups and transformed what we know about medicine.images [../images/00001.jpeg]Pre-Internet, it might have taken 20 or 30 years to reverse an accepted medicalidea. Now the Internet has shown that a savvy patient-to-patient network cancreate a revolution in medical thinking much, much faster.images [../images/00001.jpeg]In 1980, the overwhelming number of patient-activists did not exist tofact-check and experiment. The numbers not only enabled evidence gathering, thenumbers of iodine users grew loud, credible and capable of spreading themessage.When the Iodine Movement first gained traction on www.breastcancerchoices.org[http://www.breastcancerchoices.org], Karen, one of our Breast Cancer Think Tankmembers, asked, “If iodine is so good, why doesn’t the Life Extension Foundationsell it?” I remember answering, “It’s just a matter of time.” And, of course,that prediction proved true. Lugol’s and Iodoral are now available everywheredue to customer demand.The Iodine Revolution: The Grass Roots Steals Back IodineWhen we describe Dr. Abraham’s challenge to prevailing myths about iodine asrevolutionary, is that just hype?According to T.S. Kuhn, the author of The Structure of Scientific Revolutions,the word, “revolution” refers to a shift in power due to a shift in thinking.Thinking differently translates into shifting entrenched assumptions to anopposite perspective. An opposite perspective translates into opposite actions.images [../images/00001.jpeg]The so-called fundamental law of physiology—that iodine can shut down thethyroid gland—has been challenged, overthrown and even reversed.images [../images/00001.jpeg]Dr. Abraham was the original thinker who looked at Wolff-Chaikoff Effect studiesand didn’t observe the same phenomena or reasoning which had made its way intotextbooks. He looked at the history of iodine and saw the Wolff-Chaikoffcharacterization as a brief interval in medical history wrong-headedness thatcaught on. As Kuhn says, history is not usually taken seriously by doctors. Theyput their faith in the present, not the past. Doctors usually see knowledge asevolving, not devolving.The power of a runaway bad idea can be unstoppable for generations until someonequestions it, and this is what happened; because Dr. Abraham not only discoveredthe bad idea, he set out to unmask it. He stopped the runaway bad idea. Doctors,such as Dr. David Derry in Canada who wrote Iodine and Breast Cancer, and Dr.Jonathan Wright, who had been using potassium iodide in his practice, supportedAbraham’s mission. They were pro-iodine but did not systematically decide tochallenge the authority of the Wolff-Chaikoff thinking as Dr. Abraham had.Historical Importance of the Wolff-Chaikoff ReversalThe Iodine Movement created a revolution in thinking, not just because Dr.Abraham created a shift in thinking about iodine, but because he created areversal in thinking. Iodine has been redefined from a poison to a vitalnutrient with life-changing benefits. From a dusty bottle in the back of themedicine cabinet bearing a skull and cross bones to a supplement health foodstores can’t keep on the shelves.The Iodine Movement has applied Dr. Abraham’s research and found new ways torevive the rich history of a 15,000-year-old iodine medicine. We have stolenback the iodine information. The tens of thousands of people in the IodineMovement are a walking refutation of Wolff-Chaikoff.“Historians must recapture the past and work the present,” writes T.S. Kuhn. Butreverse engineering in medicine is laughed at. The premise persists that if anidea is new, it must be right. When Dr. Abraham documented that the 150 years ofiodine use had proved safe, his report challenged the medical industry dictumthat anything new must be better. Iodine’s long history provided momentum forIodine Movement activists. The more history was unearthed, the more compellingwas the rationale for iodine.To this day, whenever I speak on iodine, the audience tells me the mostmemorable information is the historical use of iodine. They remember the CivilWar iodine canteen I hold up and the iodine locket I show that was used duringInfluenza epidemics by The British Red Cross. They remember Van Gogh writing hisbrother about how iodine helped his syphilis. They remember the hundred andforty year-old, yellowed letter from the woman writing to her sister about howiodine helped her breast pain.images [../images/00001.jpeg]Wolff-Chaikoff created an Iodine Prohibition Movement completely contrary to acentury of evidence which produced volumes of books supporting iodine asbeneficial and even miraculous.images [../images/00001.jpeg]How could Wolff-Chaikoff create such a change in the laws of physiology in theface of this contradiction? How many women and men have suffered, yes, evendied, because Wolff-Chaikoff’s conclusions that became the law of medicine?Should we care now that the truth has been exposed?The answer is an emphatic, “We must!”We should care how this happened because other such wrong-headed ideas mightdominate other treatment regimens where the stakes are high. Wolff-ChaikoffEffect thinking has lasted five decades and is on its way out, but probably hasseveral years left until the final straggler reviews the evidence and clinicalreports.History will reflect that the Wolff-Chaikoff Effect has been transformed intothe Wolff-Chaikoff Interval, a period of time when a flawed theory made its wayinto medical practice and research because of lack of peer diligence. A lack ofpeer diligence that has harmed untold numbers.Thoughts • What other flawed thinking is out there in the medical textbooks,totally accepted and totally wrong? How long will it take to change thinking?Who is brave enough to challenge the text books and withstand the scoffing? • Changes in thinking equals changes in action equals changes inrelationships equals shifts in power relationships. The debunking of theWolff-Chaikoff thinking can provide a gateway event to the challenge of otherauthoritarian notions. That is, if medical consensus got that wrong, what elsedid they get wrong? How many have been harmed or died from it? • The fall of the Wolff-Chaikoff Interval provides a great learningexperience to those who possess the courage to believe their own observationsand reasoning rather than what has been handed down as law. images [../images/00001.jpeg]More Iodine StoriesMeet Don: Fibromyalgia results lead to Lugol’s application to testicles.I have been taking Iodine orally for several years because of fibromyalgia pain.It really worked although it took me a while to get up to the 50 mg because Iwas resistant to taking the salt water. Then I found if you put the sea saltinto gelatin capsules, you don’t have to actually drink salt water.Then I recently heard of the topical painting of Lugol’s solution directly onthe testicles so I thought I’d give it a try. I tried one drop at a time mixedwith Laura’s Organics iodine salve. Only when I got up to 15 drops did I feelsomething odd in my genitals. My organs seemed to wake up. I hope researcherswill explore this. Women have publicized the benefits of iodine for femaleproblems but men have hung back. I wish more guys would try this and reporttheir results.Meet Joan: Pomphlyx eczema resolves.I’m taking Iodine to prevent a recurrence of breast cancer. I had manyobservations when I initially took iodine, most of which I have forgotten.However, one complaint I have had diagnosed is a kind of eczema known aspomphlyx here in the UK. If I don’t take a MINIMUM of 2 drops Lugol’s Iodinemost days, my eczema starts to develop on my fingers and feet. It always goeswhen I resume iodine. I started high dose MSM recently (one of my experimentalforays!) and the eczema came back quite aggressively. I increased my iodine andgot the balance right, and away it went.My nephew also controls his eczema now with iodine.Meet Melinda: Sinus and allergy issues resolve with money saving alternative.I started 50 mg Iodoral when Stephanie B mentioned it after I was diagnosed withthyroid cancer. My use was scattered, depending on my finances. After breastcancer, I upped it to 200 mg.I have had sinus issues forever, usually with one or two sinus infections in thespring and again in the fall. I have many allergies. An early season like thisone would have normally caused me a lot of misery, but I’ve sailed through itthis year. I am back to 100 mg now due to finances. I use to spend approximately$42 monthly on DeHist, a natural antihistamine to keep sinuses from botheringme.Meet Alice: Breast calcifications, coldness, hair loss, Raynaud’s Disease, allclearing up or resolved.I started using iodine about 18 months ago when I decided not to get astereotactic biopsy for suspicious calcifications. I took an iodine loadingtest. I was only slightly deficient, about 15 percent but the doctor advised meto take 100 mg daily of Iodoral along with ATP cofactors in case of an earlystage of cancer.About six months ago I had an ultrasound of the area and, after carefulexamination, there were no visible calcifications. I did not get a mammogram asI do not want to have one anymore, but I knew that the calcifications picked upon my last mammogram had also been seen on the ultra sound. Also, thermographsshowed improvement and less inflammation in the area.Iodine has done wonders for me. Fibrocystic disease is clearing up. I also thinkthat I may have had a sluggish thyroid that was not picked up on blood tests asnow my feet are no longer cold, my Raynaud’s Disease has gone away and myalopecia (hair loss) is almost resolved.Now I am taking 50 mg of Iodoral a day as it will probably take another fewyears, to totally resolve fibrocystic disease.I took other measures that I researched but I think the Iodoral was the mainplayer in my success. I hope my story helps others.Thanks to people like you for the work you do.images [../images/00001.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"Chapter Seventeen [part0005.html#rch17]Who Stole Iodine From My Food? [part0005.html#rch17]We know from world studies that if you give iodine during pregnancy the babiesthat come out are usually 20-30 points higher in IQ than their parents.—Jorge Flechas, MD, MPHimage [../images/00010.jpeg]The National Center for Health Statistics, the government agency that measuresnutrients, reported that people tested in 2000 excreted half the iodine in theirurine than those tested in 1971–1974.After 1972, Iodine Gone from Bread!Researchers believe the drop in urinary iodine levels comes from when iodine wasremoved from bread and baked goods around 1970.In the 1960s, the average slice of bread contained 150 mcg iodine in the form ofpotassium iodate. Even one slice contained the RDA (recommended dailyallowance). Public health officials and food scientists regard iodine as afortificant, a substance that provides nutrients that are easy to miss inadequate quantities without adding them to common foods. When iodine in the formof potassium iodate was added to bread, the average person might consume severalslices of bread a day through sandwiches, breakfast toast or other baked goods,so the average iodine consumption was at least a milligram per day. That was asignificant amount to protect the thyroid. Also, iodate in bread is absorbedvery efficiently and made an excellent dough conditioner.images [../images/00001.jpeg]We’re waiting for a researcher to access bread companies’ files and see if wecan trace back why iodine was removed across the board from most commercialbreads. Did some official feel iodine was harmful in the wake of theWolff-Chaikoff era?images [../images/00001.jpeg]A 1970 conference report from the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy ofSciences, titled Iodine Nutriture in the United States, strongly hints thatiodine in bread may not be safe and that iodized salt is superior. Thescientists also report that it is difficult to get a readable radioactive-iodinemedical scan since the population became more iodine sufficient. The uptake ofthe scanning chemicals could not penetrate tissues that were iodine replete. Sothe radioactive scans only lit up when people were iodine deficient? Were theysuggesting public health policy should change, that people lower their iodineintake in order to get better radioactive iodine images? Does the importance ofcreating better images transcend the importance of iodine sufficiency? It looksthat way.The function of the report appears to be to raise insidious questions disguisedas public concern—Is iodate in bread dangerous?The report answers its own question by urging that iodized salt remain the GoldStandard. By 1980, wild claims were published. The USDA reports in TheFortification of Foods: A Review, that iodine as a disinfectant “has long beenknown to be lethal…” [author’s italics] and that Americans get more than enoughiodine from non-bread sources, so [iodine] “should be replaced whenever possibleby compounds containing less or no iodine.”Lethal? Any documentation of “lethal?” No.No matter. Bye-bye iodine in bread. The bakery companies may have feared beingsued if someone blamed their breads for a sickness after two public groups hadscorned iodine as dangerous. Going along is always easier than buckinginfluence-leaders or checking facts.What could be worse than removing the major source of dietary iodine? … Puttingthe anti-iodine potassium bromate into commercial bread and flour. This policychange took effect in the early 1970s. How does bromine steal iodine? Bromineand iodine compete for the same receptors, so when bromate was added to replaceiodate, dietary iodine from other sources sitting on those receptors wasdisplaced. Bromate had been used earlier as a dough conditioner but was notbrought in to replace iodine significantly until the anti-iodine sentimentsbegan. Was the removal of iodine from the food supply a down-stream result ofthe Wolff-Chaikoff thinking?What about the addition of bromate? That decision by the bakers appears to beaccidental since bromate was already known as an effective dough conditionercomparable to iodine in creating pleasing bread. The bakers couldn’t haveforeseen the consequences ahead when additional bromines from fire retardantsaffected the toxic bromine load in human beings.The Iodized Salt ScamWhenever someone learns I’m writing about iodine, their eyes often glaze overbecause they assume there’s really nothing to know about iodine. Recently, on afour-hour train ride between Boston and New York, I found myself sitting next toa well-groomed man reading the Wall Street Journal. His duffel had Cliffordstamped on the side, and he talked to someone named Buffy on his cell phoneevery fifteen minutes. As I kept my head down, taking notes, he asked me what Iwas writing. “A book on iodine,” I said.“Oh, I know all about that. I use iodized salt all the time, though Buffyprefers the Himalayan pink salt.” I find it hard to restrain myself in thesecases. The diplomatic half of me wants to let the topic pass. The activist halfof me wants to scream, “Iodized salt? You want to know about iodized salt? Don’tget me started on iodized salt.” The diplomatic half generally loses the battleand I stop everything to make my case against iodized salt. I can’t help myself.images [../images/00001.jpeg]We have an iodine crisis in good part because of the iodized salt scam. It isthe government recommendation that an adequate amount of iodine can be consumedfrom iodized salt.images [../images/00001.jpeg]So, how much iodine do you obtain and absorb from iodized salt? Anyone? Anyone?No one really knows, because misleading information has created a three-partinformation scam. Whistle-blowers must challenge these government guidelinesbecause they’re based on inaccurate information and disproved assumptions thatare harmful. The report, Iodine Nutrition: Iodine Content of US Salt, byDasgupta, et al., discusses the “Iodine Gap.” The gap refers to the amount ofiodine that’s supposed to be in iodized salt and what amount can actually bemeasured by the time you use it. The researchers also point out that salt is apoor food product to fortify because chloride, which is a halogen, competes withthe iodine, making it less effective.Scam 1. The average gram of iodized salt is thought to contain 0.075 mcg. Butthat measurement is taken at the factory. By the time the salt reaches thegrocery store, half of the iodine in the sealed container has “vaporized,” or asscientists would say, the salt “sublimed” into the air. Once you get the saltcontainer to your kitchen and open it, whoosh, more iodine escapes. The longeryou keep it, the less iodine remains. Iodine in salt is unstable. Dasgupta, etal., report it takes between 20 and 40 days for an opened container of iodizedsalt to lose half of its iodine. How long have you had that iodized salt in yourpantry?So when you factor in the loss of iodine into the air, the actual consumption ofiodine through salt is completely theoretical. The amount the people add to theproduct is not what we actually get when we sprinkle iodized salt on our food.Do the math. The bottom line is, nobody knows how much iodine you get fromiodized salt. There are too many variables. Was the salt warehoused? Do you livein a damp or warm area? How long has it been in your cupboard leaking iodinefumes into the universe?Scam 2. But say you’re an average man, standing outside the Morton factory andget the freshest, most iodized salt available. What are you getting? Even themost concentrated iodized salt is only 10 percent “bioavailable,” meaning only afraction gets absorbed. Iodide may be added to salt but remember, salt is sodiumchloride. Chloride and iodide are both in the halogen family of elements so theycompete with each other for the same receptors. Chloride has the ability tocancel out at least some of the benefit of iodide. Again, do the math. You’reonly absorbing 10 percent of whatever the good people at Morton put in thecontainer. Unlike adding iodine to flour as potassium iodate, the iodine in saltis difficult to absorb. You certainly may get some iodine from iodized salt butwhat goes in doesn’t necessarily get to the right places.Scam 3. But say you’re a woman standing outside the factory and get the freshestsalt which is only 10 percent bioavailable, you’re might get a protectiveamount, right? A protective amount if, say, you consumed a pound a day?No. Not if you’re a woman. The salt is iodized with potassium iodide which maybe helpful to the thyroid. But the breasts and ovaries need iodine as well asiodide. This time, you can skip the math and just go straight to the science.Women are taking the wrong iodine.Is there ever any reason to consume processed iodized salts in this time ofIodine Crisis? The answer is, 1. Only in an emergency when you need salt and can’t accessunprocessed salt. 2. Only if you can’t afford iodine supplementation.Taking iodized salt alone as a source of iodine actually only benefitscommunities too poor to get any other kind of iodine. Iodizing salt was meant toprevent goiter, but nothing else. The minimal iodized salt standard is, in fact,the “Goiter Standard,” but does not reflect the needs of the other organs. TheGoiter Standard of iodine provides a disappointingly low bar for the governmentto set when iodine helps prevent so many other illnesses. Skimping on the cheapcost of iodine means paying for more expensive problems down the line. Anotherthing to remember is that processed salts often come with controversial aluminumanti-caking chemicals. I wouldn’t take aluminum-laced processed salt productsunless I had a lot of cash socked away for future Alzheimer’s care.images [../images/00001.jpeg]More Iodine StoriesMeet Marla: Lumpy, sore, fibrocystic breasts resolve.

I started doing some research on my own,ended up going to a chiro for a back problem. She had me lie on my stomach toadjust me, and, wow, did my breast hurt! Well, that was the best day of my“health” life! She did a manual lymphatic drainage and put me on Iodoral. Thedrainage relieved my pain immediately, but it came back within a day or so.I continued with the Iodoral. My husband was the first one to notice adifference and link it to the Iodoral. In about three weeks, I just felt good.Really good. I had energy, I felt like going places and doing things. It was nota jittery caffeine energy; it was just what a normal 30-year-old should feellike. And my libido was back. That is what my husband noticed! Prior to theIodoral, I just didn’t want to be with my husband. I wanted to want to, but Ijust didn’t. But suddenly, I wanted to!And finally, on to my breast. My breast pain would start exactly 10 days beforemy period. And be very severe. On the second month, no pain before. None at all.And as long as I am on my Iodoral, it doesn’t come back. If I am not on it, itcomes back immediately. My mother had breast cancer at 38. I am now 35, I havetaken control of my health, and I will not be a silent victim!

When I raised this linguistic problem, I was told “benign breast diseaseis normal because it’s so common.”Even a hundred years ago, when syphilis afflicted nearly 50 percent of theEuropean population in the 1800s, nobody ever suggested it was normal.images [../images/00001.jpeg]But if a disease is so common, wouldn’t that make it an epidemic? Or some kindof massive public health problem? When did common equal normal? Fact-check myreasoning. A common-normal-benign-disease makes a double oxymoron, right?images [../images/00001.jpeg]Unfortunately, back then I was young and inexperienced, so when doctors gave methe double oxymoron explanation, I was not yet schooled enough to challengeauthorities or assumptions. I surrendered my common sense to anybody carrying aclipboard or wearing a white coat. Assumption: “They must know what they’redoing.”Only when I began my own independent research did I uncover the fact—theevidence—that benign breast disease can progress to cancer. I realized theextent of how badly I was misled with this normal-common-benign-breast diseasemyth. In fact, research shows breast cancer doesn’t “strike,” but most oftendevelops slowly when the breasts are sick and inflamed. Not all sick breastseventually develop cancer, but benign breast disease creates a high risk factor.Mayo Clinic research found that one third of women diagnosed with the benignbreast disease, called atypical hyperplasia, will progress to invasive breastcancer within five years.images [../images/00001.jpeg]What makes the breast, nature’s most mysterious baby food factory, sick orinflamed? Since the condition is so common, you’d think scientists would bepaying more attention or looking for a cause, asking why or identifying when, inthe course of a woman’s life, breast health starts to deteriorate.images [../images/00001.jpeg]Have you ever heard a doctor ask: “Why could you have sick breasts?” or “Whathave you been exposed to?” Medicine will ask, “How did you pick up that virus?”“Where have you been that you could have gotten that infection?” If you arediagnosed with mesothelioma, they will ask if you were exposed to certaincarcinogens. Has anybody in the history of the universe been asked why theirbreasts are swollen, tender or lumpy? Show of hands. Anyone? Anyone?Nobody.At best, practitioners prescribe anti-inflammatory supplements such as eveningprimrose oil or Advil, or tell patients to avoid caffeine. But applying these“band aids” ignores the condition. If either of these strategies helps at all,they work by masking the underlying cause. Any inflammation may improve withanti-inflammatory meds, or less dehydrating caffeine. But what caused theinflammation in the first place? As Dr. David Brownstein would say,Fibrocystic breast disease is not an Advil deficiency syndrome.Our culture has been brainwashed with the myth that sick breasts are normal andthat breast cancer strikes suddenly between mammograms; that one day yourbreasts appear perfectly healthy, and then, bang, some nasty white spot shows upon a mammogram. Scientists know breast cancers have been growing for seven ormore years before detection but the pop culture myth of cancer striking insteadof developing, persists. This erroneous message is marketed by the OctoberBreast Cancer Awareness Month™ campaigns. Yes, you read that right. That’s atrademark symbol after the name. Breast Cancer Awareness Month™ is trademarkedby Astra-Zeneca, a drug company that manufactures breast cancer drugs.“Awareness” is a billion dollar industry.But awareness of what? Cause? No. October might as well be renamed mammogramawareness month—all based on the breast cancer “strikes” myth. The Breast CancerIndustry is designed to manufacture bigger and better ways to close the barndoor after the horse has bolted. The industry just wants to catch the horse, notfix the barn door.The industry couldn’t have picked a worse time to ignore preventable riskfactors like benign breast disease. Pre-cancerous benign breast disease is agrowing crisis. Dr. Jorge Flechas has reported that benign breast diseasenotations have increased on autopsy from 23 percent in 1928 to 89 percent in1973. Not all benign disease progresses to full blown malignant disease, butmany do. Mayo Clinic Oncologist Lynn Hartmann, M.D., has been studying the riskfactors of benign breast disease progression. The New England Journal ofMedicine reports that Hartmann and her team followed women with benign diseasefor 15 years to see how many developed breast cancer as compared to womenwithout benign disease. Women diagnosed with “proliferative” benign disease were88 percent more likely to develop breast cancer. Women with the more aggressivebenign disease, atypical hyperplasia, were 4.2 times more likely to developbreast cancer than women with no history of benign disease.So the dangers of benign disease are slowly getting publicity. Dr. Hartmann nowserves as principal investigator for a Department of Defense Center ofExcellence grant titled “Benign Breast Disease: Toward Molecular Prediction ofBreast Cancer Risk.”But Medicine moves slowly. Most of us don’t want to wait 15 years of our livesfor research to tell us sick breasts are not normal. Breast cancer rates haverisen from one in 20 in 1970 to one in eight by the year 2000. Younger andyounger women are diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. How can young breastsbe getting sick so fast? You would think that young breasts haven’t been aroundlong enough to get so sick. Given that it takes seven or more years for mostbreast cancer to be detectible, does it mean a palpable threat in the nearfuture for 20-year-old women? Thirty-year-old women?image [../images/00011.jpeg]Breast cancer used to be a disease of aging women. No longer. Jennifer, a youngoperating room nurse, reports, “My breast pain has kept me from hugging anyonesince I was twelve.” Is she a future breast cancer victim?What’s going on? What could explain the rise in breast cancer? What othercancers are on the rise? Thyroid cancer has risen 182 percent since 1975. Morewomen get thyroid cancer than men. Women require much more iodine to nourish thebreasts and ovaries. Larger breasted women require even more iodine. Is there aPerfect Storm Theory of Thyroid Cancer also? Benign nodules and cysts alsoafflict these organs. What do the breasts, the ovaries and the thyroid have incommon?All three are dependent on iodine to develop and stay healthy with the abilityto, 1. Receive nourishment, and 2. Clear out toxins.Without an essential amount of iodine, the breasts and ovaries seem to getcongested and swell. Cell membranes don’t work. Without enough iodine, toxicfluids back up, causing enlargement and inflammation. Fluid collects in cysts.Ropey, fibrous tissue develops. Nodules may start growing. At its worst,fibrocystic breasts grow as hard as rocks. Nature’s baby food factory behaves asif it’s choking on a poison. Hmmm.Bromine Poisoning the Iodine ReceptorsHold on. What if a specific, anti-iodine toxin actually does poison the breasts,ovaries and thyroids by purging the protective iodine from tissues? What if thatanti-iodine poison is responsible for blocking tissues from receivingnourishment and circulating fluids? What if that poison was introduced into theenvironment in the 1970s as an element in flame retardants, pesticides and foodadditives? Could it be called the bromine family? Could the element brominecause extreme iodine deficiencies by overpowering iodine at the cellular level.The answer is, yes.The biochemists refer to such a process, where one element in the halide groupdukes it out with another, as “competitive inhibition.” When bromine dominates,iodine recedes. When bromine purges iodine, a deficiency results and the cellsbecome poisoned and inflamed. The poison paradigm is just beginning to beexplored with great encouragement because this form of poisoning is a reversiblesituation.image [../images/00012.jpeg]Nobody gets bromine poisoning overnight. It usually takes years for bromines tobuild up. Bromine fire retardants are technically characterized as “persistenttoxins,” meaning they don’t metabolize out of the body as easily as other toxinsmight. Some bromines take up residence in the tissues and stay a very long time.image [../images/00013.jpeg]1970 The Perfect Storm Theory of Breast Cancer Beginsimages [../images/00001.jpeg]I developed the Perfect Storm Theory of Breast Cancer when I observed thatbromide fire retardants and pesticides were introduced about the same time asiodate was replaced with bromate in bread. The rise in breast cancer correspondswith that time frame.images [../images/00001.jpeg] A Perfect Storm occurs when specific unrelated events come together at the sametime to cause a disaster that might be insignificant if only one event occurred.Event 1: Occurred in the 1970s when our major source of dietary iodine, theiodate form, used to fortify flour and baked goods, was removed. Event 1 was badenough.Event 2: Occurred when potassium bromate, a form of bromine, was added. Yes, ananti-iodine was added to replace iodine.The second event makes the first event more catastrophic. What little dietaryiodine might remain from eggs and ocean foods was now bullied from the body bythe bromating of flour.Event 3: But wait, there’s more. The bromination of America didn’t stop withflour. The Perfect Storm Theory of Breast Cancer identifies another majorbromine invasion in the 1970s: the mass introduction of brominated fireretardants. Fire retardant chemical dust escapes from products like rugs,upholstery, stuffed animals, mattresses, cars and electronics we use every day.We inhale the dust and it goes into our bloodstream and sequesters itself in thetissues, the endocrine system, the brain. Although fire retardant dust is themost grievous source of bromine; there are countless other sources that flowinto our bodies from brominated vegetable oil (BVO) in certain sodas, sportsdrinks and foods. We are surrounded with bromine and bromides, an insidiouselement known to sedate, to suppress the thyroid, disrupt reproduction and evencause mental illness. Bromine fire retardants are even found in breast milk.Bromide is banned in many countries but not in the US. The question becomes: Whynot here?Then the fad of avoiding salt caught on along with the notion that iodine was achemical additive. Check your supermarket. Only half of the available salt isiodized. Some people believe iodine is a chemical additive. Even if people doconsume iodized salt, iodine in salt is not absorbed nearly as well as fromflour. Iodized salt gives people a false sense of security. In 2000, TheNational Center for Health statistics found that people were consuming 50percent less iodine than they had approximately 30 years before.Subtracting iodine and adding bromine creates a devastating scenario wherebybromine dominates and iodine recedes. Bromine exposure reduces the amount ofiodine available to protect and nourish the breasts. Fluids accumulate. Cystsdevelop to wall-off toxins. Hormone receptors disrupt. Breast disease worsens.What cheap, uncomplicated element has been found to reverse benign breastdisease within one day to three months?Iodine.We know this from medical studies. We know from the thousands of women who haveused iodine and documented their stories. We know this from the hundreds ofIodine Literate Practitioners from their clinical reports. When integrativemedicine expert, Michael Schachter, MD, gave his iodine presentation at theAmerican College for the Advancement of Medicine Conference in 2010, he askedthe audience how many of them were currently prescribing iodine to theirpatients. half of the practitioners raised their hands!When I let people know I was writing a book on iodine and was looking forreports from iodine takers, I received so many emails from fibrocystic breastdisease patients that I couldn’t possibly use all the striking and heart-warmingstories of improvement and healing of sometimes lifelong afflictions.If iodine can drive out the toxin, there must be something about the antidotethat is important to keeping the breasts healthy. This is where the PerfectStorm Theory of Breast Cancer comes in. It is the story of the poison and theantidote.But Event 4 of the perfect storm comes into play when baby boomers and post babyboomers begin to get into pre-menopausal states where their hormones becomeerratic and they need their hormone receptors and breast tissues to befunctioning optimally, for the receptors to be clean and the tissues free fromtoxins. Middle aged women are most vulnerable to breast cancer and more likelyto suffer from endocrine disruption from bromines.The Perfect Storm Theory of Breast CancerMechanism of Action?Iodine has so many mechanisms of action that it’s still unclear precisely how itworks in every situation, including the breast. Dr. Guy Abraham reported thatthe term, “deobstruent” (drives out toxins), was used in the 1800s by physicianswho observed the iodine “tamp down” of infection, swelling, skin, endocrine andother abnormalities. Since then, science has learned how essential iodine is forboth the development and maintenance of healthy vital organs. But it’s clearthat, as one doctor phrased it, “the breasts love iodine.” According to a studydone by iodine pioneer Bernard Eskin, MD, way back in 1974, sick breastsabsorbed twice as much radioactive iodine as normal breasts.image [../images/00014.jpeg]images [../images/00001.jpeg]Scientists have determined some specific actions of iodine on the breast. • When dietary iodine was blocked in rodents, they developedswelling, nodules and benign breast disease. • Rodents given the breast cancer-causing chemical, DMBA would notdevelop tumors if they were iodine-sufficient. • Iodine desensitizes estrogen receptors in the breast. • When scientists (Vega-Riveroll et al) gave a group of breastcancer patients iodine after biopsy, iodine (1) caused cancer cell death, (2)slowed cancer cell division and (3) reduced the size and number oftumor-promoting blood vessels, Iodine reduced estrogen production fromoveractive ovaries.images [../images/00001.jpeg]Can we reverse the Perfect Storm? Can we reduce the risk for breast cancer byreverse-engineering the three confluent forces that create this life-threateningdisease?The Iodine Solution means “take action.” Arrest the perfect storm in its tracks.Nip iodine deficiency in the bud.

Don’t wait.images [../images/00001.jpeg]More Iodine StoriesMeet SuAnn: Mole came off breast, breast inflammation no longer measurable, nobreast cancer recurrence.I have three success stories from using iodine:I had a small mole/growth on my skin on top of my left breast implant. I paintedit with Lugol’s 2% occasionally over a two year period. It came off and now Idon’t have to worry about a mole becoming cancerous.In 2009, I had a thermogram showing a hot spot on my right breast. Now annualthermograms do not show any inflammation on my right breast. I have been takingIodoral with companion nutrients as well as painting my breast with Lugol’sIodine.I also have NO recurrence of breast cancer on my left side since my mastectomythree years ago (Iodoral and Lugol’s).Meet Jo: Libido and ambition return.The first day after taking 40 mg of Lugol’s, I went to sleep experiencing a“weird” heartbeat and was thinking I would go back to 20 the next day because ofthat. But then I woke up having a sexy dream and was still “interested” when Iwoke up, which is really a big deal because I’ve had zero sex drive for sometime now. Then I was able to make breakfast, take a shower, put on clothes,cross a busy street to mail a letter, and walk a mile to the pet store and back.Doesn’t sound like much, but this is really a marked improvement. I’d beenputting off doing these things for days, and today was the first day I had theability.Meet Felicia: Menopausal night sweats disappear.My doctor told me iodine normalizes all the hormone receptors. Maybe this is whymy menopausal night sweats have completely disappeared.Meet Greg: Bleeding gums and gum pain resolve with Lugol’s iodine flossing.I believe I got rid of my bleeding and irritated (inflamed) gums by flossingwith dental floss saturated in iodine. I’ve had this problem in varying degreesfor over a year. With the saturated flossing thread, I got the iodine to the“root” of the problem. After just a couple of weeks with twice daily flossingall my pain and bleeding are gone. Now I’m off “iodine floss” and on normalfloss in order to see if it returns or not. (Fingers crossed).Meet Maddy: Post breast cancer cyst detected on mammogram vanishes.I’m a 60 year-old cancer coach and a breast cancer survivor. I had breast cancerfifteen years ago and had a mastectomy on my left breast. Then, in 2008, Ideveloped a cyst in my remaining breast. It showed up big on a mammogram plus Icould feel it. I was concerned it could turn into a recurrence so I triedseveral things. Nothing worked. On Lynne’s Breast Cancer Think Tank I heardabout Funahashi’s work using iodine and progesterone in animals. His resultsshowed progesterone helps drive iodine to the right cells. So I took 50 mgIodoral by mouth and applied Lugol’s Iodine with a Q-Tip over the cyst area ofmy breast and a dab of natural progesterone cream once the Lugol’s absorbed intomy skin.The cyst began to shrink within 48 hours. So I dropped down on the Iodoral to 25mg. Bad idea. The cyst came right back. After sticking with the protocol, thecyst went away. My doctor was no longer able to find anything on imaging. Hewrote on the report that the cyst had disappeared. I gave all this documentationto Lynne—she uses my scan pictures in her slides when she speaks.Meet Jane: Thyroid nodules and cysts no longer visible.I can tell you that as of my last thyroid ultrasound, my thyroid nodules andcysts are no longer visible.I won’t have an ultrasound to look at my shrinking uterine fibroids for a while.As soon as I get some concrete evidence, and see the look on my ob/gyn’s face, Iwill contact you.Meet Marjorie: This is her story about her nickel-sized breast lump,fibromyalgia and other important observations (printed with permission from herblog).http://thisissogood.wordpress.com/2012/02/10[http://www.thisissogood.wordpress.com/2012/02/10]This is another one of those posts that I have wanted to write for many months.Hopefully you find it interesting and maybe helpful to you or someone you know.My purpose is two-fold: discuss my experience with fibrocystic breast diseaseand iodine supplementation and review Iodine Why You Need It and Why You Can’tLive Without It.In 2005 (age 28), I found a small mass in my left breast. At the time I wascompletely wrapped up in the conventional wisdom mindset. Low fat and so-called“heart healthy” whole grains were in my regular rotation, I was clocking seriouschronic cardio at the gym, and Western medicine seemed to have all the answers.Panicking, I called my physician and went in for a breast exam. She agreed thatthe mass was abnormal and immediately sent me for a mammogram. I was a stressedmess leading up to that test and during the mammogram, I almost passed out. Ithink it was a combination of the pain (OMG) and anxiety.Sure enough, they saw something on the films! I was instructed to see a surgeonto discuss my options. He informed me that I had fibrocystic breast disease andthat the mass I found was a fibroadenoma. Not cancerous, but something thatshould be removed because if left alone, they can grow to the size of soft-balls(more panicking). So I agreed to have it removed on an outpatient basis. I wasawake during surgery, and he showed me the lump as he removed it. It was barelythe size of a small marble. Off it went to be tested and a few days later I gotthe all clear call. Whew!So, why did this happen? What do I do about it? Will I continue to undergosurgery after surgery as these show up in the future? Answers were in thisorder: We don’t know, nothing—just watch it with regular mammograms, and, yes,you cannot ignore breast masses. Fabulous. So, like a good girl, I continued tohave regular breast exams and routine mammograms plus numerous ultrasounds.During this time, there were no suspicious masses or lumps. After the secondmammogram, I started to refuse. My Western medicine doctor agreed to let me stopthem until I turned 40 as long as I did regular breast exams. OK. Deal.Meanwhile, I had developed chronic low back pain. In 2009, I started to seekalternative treatment for my pain, as conventional medicine had failed torelieve my symptoms … I had fantastic success with a Holistic physician andasked him for a referral to a Holistic family practice doctor. I was now a fullblown believer in Alternative/Holistic/Naturopathic medicine. In April, 2011, Itransferred all of my records to her office and saw her for a physical toestablish myself as a patient. We discussed my fibrocystic breast diseasehistory. She did an exam and noted no abnormalities, but stated we would watchfrom year-to-year (still encouraging me to do regular breast exams). One monthlater, I found a nickel sized mass in my right breast. Oh no—here we go again …I made an appointment to see my new doctor and during the one week leading up tothe appointment, the mass had increased in size (now approximatelyquarter-sized). Recalling all that was said to me in the past, I blabbered on toher about not wanting surgery or a mammogram! She listened and then quicklycalmed my fears. Absolutely no mammograms and a very good chance that I couldavoid surgery.Step one was testing with breast thermology. Totally noninvasive, painless, andno, nothing—just watch it with regular mammograms, and yes, you cannot ignoreradiation free. The procedure is not covered by insurance (of course), but I waswilling to shell out the $100 for peace of mind and some answers to my currentcondition…. As expected, my scan came back negative for cancer, but positive foranother fibroadenoma.Step two was to start supplementing with high doses of Iodine (50 mg Iodoral)and 100 mcg Selenium. I don’t know why, but this really freaked me out. The USRDA for Iodine is 150 mcg. Was it safe to take so much? What are the sideeffects? Would there be long term consequences?My doctor assured me that there was no need to worry. Although I trusted her, Iwas still unsure. I hurried home and started to research Iodoral supplementationand fibrocystic breast disease. I found next to nothing. What I did find onlinewas quite discouraging. Women reporting that they had tried Iodoral withoutimprovements in their symptoms. At the same time all of this was occurring, Alexhad a friend at work that was being treated for breast cancer by Dr. DavidBrownstein’s Center for Holistic Medicine in West Bloomfield, MI. She purchasedhis book, Iodine: Why You Need It and Why You Can’t Live Without It, for me, andI dug into it as soon as I got my hands on it. I won’t get into the sciencehere, I won’t do it justice. What I will say is that the breasts and the thyroidare two of the body’s main storage sites for Iodine. In a deficient or depletedstate, these tissues become primed for illness including fibrocystic breastdisease and breast cancer. Dr. Brownstein’s book contains an entire chapterdevoted to this topic.So I decided to give the supplementation a try. My instructions were to take 50mg Iodoral and 100 mcg Selenium one time a day for six weeks, and then cut theIodoral in half to 25 mg (continue to take the Selenium) for another six weeks.After that, my physician said I could again cut the Iodoral dose in half (12.5mg) and continue to take the selenium. This would be my maintenance dose.I did it. And guess what? IT WORKED!!! Within a couple of weeks the mass wassmaller, less dense, and not as tender. Within a month it was half the size itwas before supplementation. Within two months, it was GONE. Gone—without pain,without stress, without an invasive procedure.So why did it work? From Dr. Brownstein’s book Iodine: Why You need It and WhyYou Can’t Live Without It:Animal studies have shown conclusively that an iodine deficient state can alterthe structure and function of the breasts. After my own research and study, Iconcur with several investigators that iodine deficiency is a causative factorin breast cancer and fibrocystic breast disease. I believe it is essential thatwomen have their iodine levels tested, and if it is shown there is an iodinedeficiency, iodine supplementation should be initiated.The breasts are one of the body’s main storage sites for iodine in the body. Inan iodine-deficient state, the thyroid gland and the breasts will compete forwhat little iodine is available. Therefore, this will leave the thyroid glandand the breasts iodine depleted and can set the stage for illnesses such asgoiter, hypothyroidism, autoimmune thyroid disease, breast illnesses includingcancer, and cystic breast disease. In addition, other glandular tissues such asthe ovaries which contain the second highest concentration of iodine in thebody, will also be depleted in an iodine deficient state.The breasts and thyroid aren’t the only utilizers of iodine. It is needed by theprostate gland, the gastro-intestinal tract, salivary glands, bones, andconnective tissues. If you have any of these parts and you want to keep themhealthy, you should probably make sure you have adequate iodine in your diet.So that’s my story and I felt it was important to share. My fibrocystic breastdisease was present way before I started a Paleo/Primal/Ancestral lifestyle, butI think it’s valuable to note that this eating style is generally low in iodine.Most of us opt for Celtic sea salt over iodized table salt when cooking after wemake the switch. Cutting out packaged, processed foods also cuts out iodizedsalt intake. Our soil, especially in the Mid-Western states, is deficient inIodine, meaning our produce and pastured animal products are not a good source.Fish is a decent source, and sea vegetables are fabulous sources, but these arenot foods that are typically eaten everyday by our population.I strongly encourage you to find a Holistic or Naturopathic physician that canassist you in testing and determining your need for Iodine supplementation. Iwouldn’t recommend undertaking this on your own, as your doctor will likely wantto monitor your thyroid function while supplementing.There is one other note that I wanted to make. I work in the medical field andam nose deep in conventional Western medicine every day. I truly believe thatthere are Western medicine practices and amazing medical advancements that haveimproved our lives greatly. However, our current medical field does have itsshortcomings and my story is an example. We should not be treating the symptoms,we should be investigating and treating the cause. Otherwise, are we truly everhealed or are we just chasing our tails?images [../images/00001.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"Chapter Nineteen [part0005.html#rch19]Moving Forward—Beyond the Iodine Crisis [part0005.html#rch19]Every truth passes through three stages before it is recognized.

By sharing, we will defeat the IodineCrisis. Because, while iodine deficiency is epidemic worldwide, the pain andisolation affects us individually—one at a time. Sharing information is the onlyway. Our boon for this process is the power of the Internet, available for thefirst time to the most recent generations of our troubled world. If just oneperson can be rescued from the abyss of a chronic complaint, sharing theinformation in The Iodine Crisis will be worth the time taken to read it.Remember the disconcerting fact: most doctors and scientists cannot speak outdirectly against the current “standard of care” RDA iodine recommendations.Where has that thinking—that standard of care—come from? Not from facts, and notfrom people who have experienced the life changing iodine facts. Most licensedpractitioners must play along with the old, mainstream thinking because thepersonal price for reporting positive, effective discoveries that challenge thatthinking is too high.We need to support the practitioners who are discreetly whistle-blowing aboutiodine deficiency. Unfortunately, discovery of an effective solution to a healthproblem can damage a career or jeopardize a license. History is filled withexamples of conservative—no, reactionary—thinking standing in the way ofimportant discoveries made by thoughtful, farsighted individuals—solutions toage-old problems causing untold suffering.Remember, in the 1800s, Dr. Semmelweis was ridiculed for suggesting that doctorsshould wash their hands before delivering babies in order to prevent the mothersfrom dying of childbed fever. What a paradox—the more a medical or scientificprofessional knows about life-changing information, the more he or she must hangback.The privilege of spreading the word falls to the lay public ofpatient-to-patient medicine. The case studies we share here need to reach morepeople—need to be much more broadly publicized.

That’s too low for our current bromine-saturated environment. ContactThe National Academy of Sciences and ask them to rethink their recommendations. • Reject it! The much-promoted notion that iodized salt provides enoughiodine for optimal health is a complete scam! Reject it. No one even knows howmuch iodine is actually in salt since it vaporizes out as soon as the carton isopened. • Share it!

Abraham, with his colleagues, have found the 24 Hour Iodine Loadingtest helpful in assessing a patient’s iodine sufficiency.The principle is, if the body’s level of iodine is adequate, most of the 50 mgiodine ingested at the start of the test will be excreted in the urine within 24hours.If the body shows insufficiency, a significant portion of the pre-test iodinedose will be retained by the body. The amount excreted in the urine will be low.The Iodine Doctors find that any test result showing saturation lower than 90percent suggests the patient is a candidate for iodine supplementation.Update from the ‘07 Iodine Conference: Normal test results in the presence ofknown iodine-deficiency conditions such as thyroid disorders or breast diseasemay indicate an absorption defect with the Sodium Iodide Symporter (NIS)mechanism. In this case, the iodine given as part of the test may not getabsorbed and pass through the body into the urine.There may be a “false normal” test result. The doctors recommend supplementingwith iodine for three months and then repeating the test. As the iodinesupplementation improves the absorption, the test numbers should go lower(appropriate to the clinical condition), then steadily rise.For Iodine Investigation Project participants, Breast Cancer Choices recommendstesting at FFP Labs to assure consistency of results for our database.

Thus, bromide dominance is diminished and properiodine enzyme metabolism may be restored.In the toxic 21st Century, these questions must be raised: • Would we have such a severe iodine deficiency without bromidedominance? • If iodine deficiency is the underlying cause of many diseases, isbromide “the underlying cause of the underlying cause?” • Is bromide dominance creating a public health crisis?Where Does Bromide Dominance Come From?Bromide is an insidious additive used in many common products, and as apesticide. Because of the sheer amount of bromine-related chemicals supplementedproducts, exposure to this man-made additive has caused a depletion of iodine inhuman populations. Studies in lab animals provide alarming evidence that evensmall amounts of bromide exposure can be toxic (1).What products contain bromine/bromide?Currently, bromide is found in pesticides (methylbromide), some bread products(potassium bromate), brominated vegetable oil that may be added tocitrus-flavored drinks, hot tub cleansers, certain asthma inhalers andprescription drugs, plastic products, some personal care products and somefabric dyes.Effects of Bromine on the OrgansIodine depletion weakens the thyroid and other organs (2)(3)(4)(5)(6). Inindividuals where the bromide-iodine ratio is less, bromide may not beproblematic.ThyroidElevated bromide levels have been implicated in every thyroid disease, fromsimple hypothyroidism to auto-immune diseases to thyroid cancer. Malenchenkofound bromide levels 50 times higher in thyroid cancer than normal thyroidtissue (7).Rats fed even the minimal amount of bromine expected to be encountered in theenvironment underwent goiter-like changes (8), an arguable case of bromidedominance. In the FIRE project, exposing rats to the brominated flame retardantcompound, bromocyclodecane, showed consistent effects on the thyroid hormoneaxis, including decreased T4. Thyroid gland cells have increased size and largernuclei, indicating increased synthetic activity (9).With enhanced intake of bromide, fully one-third of the iodine content in thethyroids of rats was replaced by bromide (10).SkinSkin biopsied from a woman who had been on bromide-containing sedatives fornearly four years found increased bromide in normal skin and three times that inan affected skin lesion (11).An infant administered a syrup containing sodium bromide developed vegetativelesions on the face and scalp (12).Technicians exposed to brominated compounds for prolonged periods developedmultiple cherry angiomas on the trunk and extremities (13).MentalThe psychiatry literature abounds with cases of elevated bromide levels beingimplicated in mental conditions from depression to schizophrenia (14)(15)(16).As Guy Abraham, MD, asks, “How many people with misdiagnosed bromism arecurrently treated with psychiatric drugs?” (17). Bromide was used to suppresswomen’s sex drive in the 1950s.HearingPotassium bromate, a bread additive, is known to cause renal damage andpermanent deafness in animals and man (18). In the FIRE project, the mostrelevant effect on exposing rats to 28 days of the brominated flame retardantcompound, tetrabromo-bisphenol-A, was hearing. Specifically, the lower frequencyrange was affected (19).KidneysThe ability of bromate to cause cancer, especially kidney cancer, is asignificant health concern (20). The gene expression in kidneys in rats given ahigh dose—100-week potassium bromate—in their drinking water showed marked geneexpression difference from the lower non-cancer dose. The high dose kidney geneexpression resembled an adenoma-like expression pattern (21).Bromines in Common ProductsBreadPotassium bromate as an additive to most commercial bread and baked goodsprobably provides the most egregious contribution to bromine overload in Westerncultures.Bromated flour is product “enriched” with potassium bromate. Some commercialbakers claim they use bromated flour because it yields dependable results, andit makes more elastic dough which can stand up to bread hooks and othercommercial baking tools (22). However, Pepperidge Farm manages to use onlyunbromated flour with excellent results.Note on Banning Potassium Bromate in BreadThe UK banned bromate in bread in 1990. Canada banned bromate in bread in l994(23). Proposal P230 in Australia: Food Regulation Ministerial Council (FSANZ),still has not finalized its July 2007 proposal to mandate iodized salt inbreads, breakfast cereals and biscuits.Back in 1999, the Center for Science in the Public Interest petitioned the FDAto prohibit the use of potassium bromate, charging that the FDA has known foryears that bromate causes cancer in lab animals, but has failed to ban it (24).As of September 2007, the US FDA responded to a Breast Cancer Choices inquirywith the statement, “Potassium bromate is still listed as a safe additive.”WaterWhen drinking water containing bromide is exposed to ozone, the bromate ion, apowerful oxidizing agent, is formed. Two recalls of drinking water involvingbromate have occurred: Wegmann’s “Food Your Feel Good About” spring water recallin 2006, and Coca-Cola’s “Dasani” in 2004 (25).Toothpaste, Mouthwash and GarglesPotassium bromate is an antiseptic and astringent in toothpaste, mouthwash andgargles. Very toxic if taken internally. May cause bleeding and inflammation ofgums in toothpaste (26).Bromine in Flame RetardantsFlame retardants reduce the flammability of a wide variety of commercial andhousehold products. Some brominated home retardants (BFRs) migrate from theproducts in which they are used and enter the environment and people via dust(27).Personal Products and Some CosmeticsSodium bromate in products like permanent waves, hair dyes and textile dyes:Sodium bromate is in permanent wave neutralizers, hair dye material, and thetextile dyeing process (28). Benzalkonium is used as a preservative in somecosmetics (29).References1.

Desensitized estrogen receptors in the breast. 2. Reduced estrogen production in overactive ovaries. 3. Reduced fibrocystic breast disease which often precedes breast cancer. 4. Caused cancer cell death, slowed down cell division, reduced bloodvessel growth to tumors. 5. Caused more cell death than the chemo drug, Fluorouracil. 6. Prevented rats from getting cancer when they were fed the breastcancer causing toxin DMBA.Research Suggests Some Breast Cancers May Be an Iodine Deficiency DiseaseAs iodine consumption has gone down, breast cancer rates have gone up. But theresearch goes far deeper, exploring the effects of iodine supplementation onbreast disease and breast cancer. This important breakthrough has been in theresearch pipeline for years but only recently has found momentum. After siftingthrough 50 years of iodine research and corresponding with researchers aroundthe world, the author reports that abnormal iodine metabolism, due either tobromide dominance in the environment or a dietary deficiency of iodine, must beaddressed as part of a preventive and/or a therapeutic strategy.Iodine deficiency is growing worse.Iodine consumption by Americans has dropped 50 percent since the 1970s as breastcancer rates have risen (1). In the US Goiter Belt, where iodine in the soil islower, breast cancer is higher (2).By contrast, the incidence and severity of breast cancer are less in Japan thanin Europe and the US, is attributable to the diet (3). Japanese women consume 25times more dietary iodine than North American women and have lower breast cancerrates (4).Meanwhile, since the 1970s, in the US and several other countries,iodine-blocking bromine chemicals have been added to flour, some sodas, andmedications, exacerbating the iodine deficiency.Fluoridated drinking water also depletes iodine absorption. Thus, as womenconsume less iodine and excrete more due to toxic elements, our risk for breastcancer grows (5).Iodine and Benign Breast DiseaseBlocking iodine in rats’ food supply led to progressive, human-like fibrocysticdisease (atypia, sclerosing, calcifications, dysplastic changes) as the ratsaged (6). Iodine supplemention of patients with fibrocystic disease helped toresolve fibrosis and reduced breast size (7).For women with painful breasts accompanying fibrocystic disease, iodine improvedsymptoms in more than 50 percent of the women who took 6.0 mg. of iodine for sixmonths (8), and brown sea algae improved pain and nodularity in 94 percent ofthe women (9). From the authors’ observations of the Iodine InvestigationProject participants, depending on the kind of iodine agent used, painful breastsymptoms have resolved in from 24 hours to three months.Since benign breast disease increases the risk of breast cancer (10), and iodineimproves fibrocystic disease, we at Breast Cancer Choices propose studies to seeif iodine supplementation decreases the risk of getting breast cancer and therisk of recurrence.Iodine and Breast CancerFor breast patients, iodine’s therapeutic mechanisms of action may be at leastthree-pronged: Hormonal (11), Biochemical (12-18), Genetic (19).That is, iodine desensitizes the estrogen receptors, alters the chemicalpathways as well as effects the genes, resulting in less cell growth, andcausing an anti-tumor effect by causing apoptosis (programmed cell death) ofmalignant cells.Iodine-rich seaweed exhibits an anti-cancer effect in rats and in the lab onhuman breast cancer cells.Adding seaweed to rats’ food delays the onset and number of rat mammary tumors(20, 21). And in the lab, mekabu seaweed causes plant-induced cell death inthree kinds of human breast cancer cells. Mekabu had a stronger effect on thecells than the chemo drug, 5-fluorouracil (22).Adding iodine to chemically-induced (DMBA) rat breast tumors, stops the growthof the tumors. Adding iodine plus medroxyprogesterone gave the highest level ofresponse: the growth-suppressed tumors showed 100 percent times the iodinecontent than the full blown (nonsuppressed) tumors. The researchers suggest thatthe uptake of iodine was enhanced by medroxyprogesterone (23).As David Brownstein, MD, phrased it, “You cannot give breast cancer to rats thathave sufficient iodine.”In small, preliminary patient studies, using the screening iodine-loading test,breast cancer patients excreted less urinary iodine than healthy people,implying iodine-deficiency (24, 25).The Breast Cancer Choices Iodine Investigation Project is currently followingpatients taking iodine to prevent recurrence. Most patients report no sideeffects. Some report a range of non-breast improvements such as change inthyroid status, ovarian cysts resolving, fibroids shrinking, improved energy,mood and mental clarity.But be aware, some iodine takers report what we believe to be iodine detoxingbromide into the bloodstream causing symptoms of bromism.According to a Department of Defense commissioned report, bromism symptoms canmanifest as lethargy, depression, “dark” thoughts, “brain fog,” constipation,leg and hip pain, acne, rashes and other symptoms. These side effects areusually reversible in 24 to 48 hours by discontinuing the iodine and allowing ashort period of washout before restarting at a lower dose. Again, as statedabove, unprocessed salt in water has relieved detox symptoms quickly by speedingup bromide detox through the kidneys. See Part 4[part0031.html#TI1E0-93d4fd601e2c41969bad1e0d6c3e7ac4].

Some brominated home retardants (BFRs) migrate from theproducts in which they are used and enter the environment and people via dust(6).Personal Products and Some CosmeticsSodium bromate in Products: Permanent Waves, Hair Dyes, Textile Dyes. Sodiumbromate is in permanent wave neutralizers, hair dye material, and the textiledyeing process (7).

Visit her blog at:Gaia-Health.com/gaia-blog/ [http://www.Gaia-Health.com/gaia-blog/]Author’s note: do not discontinue any pharmaceutical without consulting yourdoctor.Fluorine is a poison with no place in any living metabolism. Yet, it’scommonplace in pharmaceuticals. See this list below of drugs containingfluorine.Fluorine is a poison. It has no place in the metabolism of humans, animals, orplants. It destroys bones and teeth, and wreaks havoc on all body systems.Fluorine is one of the most pervasive elements in pharmaceutical drugs.Modern, drug-based medicine depends on fluorine. Early symptoms of poisoning aregenerally not recognized, as they are commonly experienced. These can includeexcess salivation, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. One mustwonder how many people believe they have flu when they’re actually sufferingfrom fluorine poisoning.These symptoms are insidious because they can indicate the beginnings of severemetabolic disorders that lead to endocrinological diseases, such ashypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia. These conditionscan have knock-on effects throughout the body in chronic disorders. Subclinicalimbalances in any of these necessary substances—calcium, magnesium, potassium,and sugar—can result in long term and permanent harm.Fluorine poisoning can also result in neurological damage, including headaches,tremors, spasms, tetanic contractions, hyperactive reflexes, seizures, andmuscle weakness. Ultimately, it causes teratogenic disorders—birth defects ofthe worst sort.It is, in fact, fluorine that makes dioxins so horrific. (For information aboutdioxin poisoning in the United States, along with a photo gallery of deformitiesthat its incarnation as Agent Orange in Vietnam unleashed, and its effects onchildren in England, search the web.Cardiovascular involvement can result in widening of QRS (abnormality inheartbeat that can result in sudden death), arrhythmias, shock, and cardiacarrest.Many common, and many infamous, drugs contain fluorine:Prozac, the first SSRI.Flonase, decongestant.Lipitor and Baycol, cholesterol reducers.Diflucan, antifungal drug.Cipro, antibiotic.Prevacid and Propulsid, antacids.This list goes on … and on and on.Ingesting a drug with fluorine is a risky act. You might think that specialwarnings would be placed on drugs compounded with fluorine, but none are.To help you protect yourself, here’s a list of most of the fluorine-based drugs,broken down by their typical use. The list is by generic name. If the drug hasbeen removed from the market, the year is added in parentheses.Drugs Which Contain FluorineAnesthetics Desflurane Droperidol Enflurane Flumazenil Halophane Isoflurane Methoxyflurane Midazolam SevofluraneAntacids Lansoprazole Cisapride (2000)Anti-anxiety Flurazapam Halazepam HydroflumethiazideAntibiotics (Fluoroquinolones) Ciprofloxacin Penetrex Flucloxacillin Gatifloxacin Gemifloxacin mesylate Grepafloxacin HCI Levofloxacin Linezolid Lomefloxacin Moxifloxacin HCl Norfloxacin Sparfloxacin Temafloxacin (1992) Trovafloxacin mesylateAntidepressants Citalopram Escitalopram Prozac Luvox Paroxetine ProgabideAntifungals Fluconazole Flucytosine/VoriconazoleAntihistamines Astemizole Levocabastine (1999)Antilipemics (Cholesterol Lowering) Atorvastatin Cerivastatin sodium (2003) Ezetimibe Fluvastatin sodiumAntimalarial Halofantrine MefloquineAntimetabolites (Chemotherapy) Aprepitant FluorouracilAntipsychotics Fluphenazine HCI Haloperidol Trifluoperazine HCIRheumatoid Arthritis Celecoxib Diflunisal Flurbiprofen Leflunomide SulindacSteroids Amcinonide Betamethosone diproprionate Clobetasol Clocortolone Dexamethasone Diflorasone Dutasteride Flumethasone Pivalate Flunisolide Fluocinolone Acetonide Fluocinonide Fluorometholone Fluticasone propionate Flurandrenolide Hydroflumethiazide"},{"pageContent":"Iodine Glossary [part0005.html#rglo]Atomidine — A liquid iodine preparation also called detoxified iodine. Reputedto have been invented by Edgar Cayce.ATP Cofactors — A specific dosage, vitamin product developed by Optimox toenhance iodine absorption.Breast Cancer Choices’ Iodine Investigation Project — The database created toassess the urinary iodine values in breast cancer patients who take the IodineLoading Test.Bromaderma — Skin rash sometimes caused by exposure to or consumption of bromineor bromide products.Bromated flour — The main flour used in the Western world since the 1970s whenpotassium iodate, a crucial source of dietary iodine, was removed from flour.Bromated flour contains potassium bromate as a dough conditioner.Bromine — The chemical element in the halogen family which competes with iodinefor the halogen receptors in the body. Bromine chemical compounds are most oftenfound as potassium bromate in wheat flour or Brominated Vegetable Oil (BVO) infoods and soft drinks. PBDE fire retardants contain the bromine compoundpolybrominated diphenyl ethers or PBDEs. PBDEs have been used in a wide array ofproducts, including building materials, electronics, furnishings, motorvehicles, airplanes, plastics, foams, and textiles. They are structurally akinto the better known PCBs.Bromide detox — The detoxification flow of bromine products from the bodytissues to the bloodstream when exposed to salt or displaced by iodine into theurine as bromide.Bromide Dominance Theory — The hypothesis conceived from the investigation andscholarship developed by Lynne Farrow positing iodine deficiency may be, inpart, a man-made condition created by the addition of bromine products intofoods and fire retardants since the 1970s:A bromide dominance condition may develop when bromine, acquired throughenvironmental, occupational, iatrogenic or dietary exposure, causes brominelevels in the body to rise to a high enough level to inhibit iodine enzymemetabolism. Iodine supplementation alters the competitive bromine-iodinerelationship causing bromide excretion. Thus, bromide dominance is diminishedand proper iodine enzyme metabolism may be restored.Bromism — The toxic state of excessive amounts of bromine building up in thetissues or bloodstream.Curezone Iodine Forum — One of the original online iodine user groups exchangingof up-to-date research on both the using, history and science of iodine. Theforum has many long-time contributors from all over the world and has produced arich database of trial and error iodine experiences. As of January 2013, theforum had received over 15 million page views.Dr. Abraham Effect — The urge to accumulate iodine research and history afterreading the works of Guy E. Abraham, MD. This urgency is a newly discoveredauto-regulatory mechanism found in the frontal lobe of the brain occurring afteriodophobia-remission has been achieved.Fibrocystic breast disease — An umbrella term describing swelling, cysts,nodules, scar tissue, fibrous tissue or breast pain.Funahashi Method — The name given to a patient-initiated technique for reducingbreast cysts. The method involves applying Lugol’s Iodine to the breasttopically along with five mg progesterone cream in addition to 50 mg Lugol’sIodine or Iodoral. This technique has nothing to do with Dr. Funahashi, whoachieved good results in rodents combining progesterone and iodine. As with anyother medical procedure, check with your licensed health care professional.Goitrogen — Any substance, microbe or food that suppresses thyroid function.Grass Roots Iodine Movement — The patient to patient education movement arisingafter Drs. Abraham, Brownstein and Flechas published their findings about thebenefits of iodine. Once the information was leaked to influence leader groups,patient-to-patient research and experimentation commenced that ignited a masssharing of information. The dramatic beneficial results of iodinesupplementation created a word of mouth revolution that challenged the previousbelief in the Wolff-Chaikoff Effect.Iodide — A form of the chemical element, iodine, widely used as potassium iodidein iodized salt as well as medicines, and as a protection from radiationexposure.Iodine — An element in the halogen family discovered by Bernard Courtois in1811. Iodine is essential to human and animal function. Thus, iodine and itscompounds are used in nutrition. Seaweed was one of the first known sources ofiodine for human health. In the mid 1800s iodine became widely regarded as a“universal medicine.”Iodine “Boing” — The nickname for the jolt of mental clarity some iodine takersreport when beginning iodine supplementation.Iodine Companion Nutrients — See Iodine Protocol in Part 4. Resources.Iodine Denier — 1. A person who denies that tens of thousands of people haveradically improved their health by supplementing iodine via the guidelinesestablished by the Iodine Project. 2. A person who claims iodine supplementersare at grave risk if they persist in this folly. 3. A person who attempts todiscredit iodine supplementation because he does not support the religiousbeliefs of the primary investigator. 4. A person who maintains belief in theWolff-Chaikoff Effect after it has been disputed.Iodine Group — The Yahoo online discussion group started by Zoe Alexander, PhD,in 2006. The Group is currently owned by Stephanie Buist, ND, and has grown toover 7,000 members.Iodine Literate Practitioner — See Iodine Literate Practitioner Directory forfull description.Iodine Loading Test — The 24 hour urine collection test developed to assessiodine sufficiency.Iodine Project — The iodine research group which began publishing their findingsin 2002 under the leadership of Guy E. Abraham, MD.See http://www.optimox.com/pics/Iodine/IOD-08/IOD_08.htm[http://www.optimox.com/pics/Iodine/IOD-08/IOD_08.htm]Iodine Resistance — A general term coined to investigate and identify whatfactors may inhibit iodine absorption.Iodoral — The Lugol’s iodine tablet manufactured by Optimox.Lugol’s Iodine Solution — The iodine product developed by Dr. Jean Lugol inFrance in 1829. The solution consists of potassium iodide (KI) and elementaliodine (I2). The potency of the solution may vary depending on theconcentration. The customary solution is 5%, but 2% and 7% are available.NAI Symporter — Stands for sodium iodide symporter. The symporters are tissuesused by the body to trap iodine from the bloodstream. Unfortunately, over timethe “traps” can become damaged by pollutants and oxidation (think rust) orbecome scarce. Atrophied symporters can worsen an iodine deficiency. In order toheal, iodine is necessary in combination with antioxidants.Oxidative Damage — Damage to tissues such as iodine symporters from anti-oxidantstarvation.Post scarcity effect — A theory explaining the body’s adaptation to a suddenincreased iodine supply after a period of iodine scarcity. Can be manifested asbreasts or thyroid swelling to trap and hoard more iodine from the bloodstreamin anticipation of another period of scarcity. Think squirrels collecting acornsfor the winter.Potassium Bromate — An additive to bread and other baked goods which replacediodine in the 1970s. The replacement of potassium iodate with potassium bromateis thought to be in part responsible for the World Health Organization’s findingthat we excrete 50 percent less iodine than we did 30 years ago.Pulse dosing — The 48-hour interrupted iodine dosing strategy developed byBreast Cancer Choices’ Iodine Investigation project. The regimen includesstopping daily iodine usage temporarily, usually for 48 hours, to enhancedetoxification by rest; the rest strengthens the organs’ ability to clear anybromides, microbes or toxins. Pulse dosing is generally used only whendetoxification becomes uncomfortable. The salt loading protocol is suggestedduring the 48 hour iodine “fast.”Salt Loading Protocol — Part of the iodine protocol that entails taking specificamounts of salt and water to facilitate the detoxification process. Thisprocedure is a variation of an old remedy used in medicine as well as by the USArmy after the certain soldiers were diagnosed with bromide toxicity.SSKI — Saturated solution of potassium iodide.Stealth Bromide — Bromide exposure that is not labeled, such as the bromine fireretardants (BFRs) in our mattresses, furniture, carpeting, electronics,upholstery, toys, cars and children’s pajamas. Many personal care products fromcosmetics to permanents also contain chemicals in the bromine family.The Perfect Storm Theory of Breast Cancer — The hypothesis created by theauthor, Lynne Farrow, suggesting the increases incidence of certain cancers,specifically, breast and thyroid cancers, since 1970, may be a result of aconfluence of events in which iodine consumption dropped by 50 percent andbromide exposure began to saturate the environment with bromine fire retardantsand other bromide toxins.Wolff-Chaikoff Effect — The influential theory which gained dominance in thelast 50 years positing that iodine shuts down the thyroid in rats.Wolff-Chaikoff has since been challenged."},{"pageContent":"Additional References and Resources [part0005.html#rref]Abernathy, et al., “Polybrominated diphenyl ethers in maternal and fetal bloodsamples.” Environmental Health Perspectives, July 1, 2003.Abraham G.
