"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Cancer can now be CURED, not just treated We are not accustomed to thinking about a cure for cancer. We think of remission as the only possibility. But this book is not about remission. It is about a cure. This is possible because in 1990 I discovered the true cause of cancer. The cause is a certain parasite, for which I have found evidence in every can- cer case regardless of the type of cancer. So lung cancer is not caused by smoking, colon cancer is not caused by a low- roughage diet, breast cancer is not caused by a fatty diet, retinal blastoma is not caused by a rare gene, and pancreatic cancer is not caused by alcohol consumption. Although these are all con- tributing factors, they are not THE cause. Once the true cause was found the cure became obvious. But would it work? I set a goal of 100 cases to be cured of cancer before publishing my findings. That mark was passe d in December, 1992. The dis- covery of the cause and cure of all cancers has stood the test of time and here it is!"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" You may not have time to read this entire book first if you have cancer and are scheduled for surgery, chemotherapy or radiation treatment. You may wish to skip the first pages which describe how a parasite and a solvent cause cancer to develop. Go directly to the instructions on eliminating th e parasite with herbs (Cancer Curing Recipe, page 19) or with electricity (Zapping Parasites, page 30). Using the herbal recipe along with the zapper is best. It only takes days to be cured of cancer regardless of the type you have. It does not matter how far progressed the cancer is— you can still stop it immediately. After you have stopped the cancer, you can turn your atten- tion to getting well (Part 2). Read the case histories to see how easy it is to stop even terminal cancers (Part 3). Learn from them to avoid mistakes. Does this mean you can cancel your date for surgery, radia- tion or chemotherapy? Yes, afte r curing your cancer with this recipe, it cannot come back. This is not a treatment for cancer: It is a cure! But if you do not wish to make your doctor angry, you could follow her or his wishes , too. Be careful not to lose any vital anatomical parts in surgery, though, because you may need them later when you are healthy! Remember that oncologists are kind, sensitive, compassion- ate people. They want the best for you. They have no way of knowing about the true cause and cure of cancer since it has not been published for them. I chose to publish it for you first so that it would come to your attention faster."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" The Cure For All Cancers © Copyright 1993 by Hulda Regehr Clark, Ph.D., N.D.

These pollutants were identi- fied using a testing device of my invention known as the Syncrometer. TM Complete instructions for building and using this device are contained in this book. Therefore anyone can repeat the tests described and verify the data. The Syncrometer is more accurate and versatile than the best existing testing methods. A method for determining the degree of precision is also pres ented. However at this point it only yields positive or negative results, it does not quantify. The chance of a false positive or a false negative is about 5%, which can be lessened by test repetition. It is in the public interest to know when a single bottle of a single product tests positive to a serious pollutant. If one does, the safest course is to avoid all bottles of that product entirely, which is what I repeatedly advise.

Acknowledgments I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Frank Jerome, DDS . for the loan of his parasite slide collection. If he had not made a slide of Fasciolopsis buskii in his student years and if he had not stored his s lides carefully for three decades, finally to loan them to me in a generous offer, none of these discoveries would have been made. Furthermore, most of these HIV/AIDS patients could not have regained their health without his development of a new metal- free dentistry. Thanks are also due to his wife, Linda , for her patience and willingness to listen to new ideas. And a very special thank you is due to Mary L. Austin, Ph.D. now deceased, for her daily support and who, up to the age of 97, had an amazing open-mindedness. Another special thank you goes to my son, Geoffrey , whose sugges- tions, computer expertise, help with instrumentation, and edit- ing were indispensable and very much appreciated. In 1996, the collaboration with Patricia Connolly Gorzen made possible our discovery of de ntal toxins and better dental practices. This led directly to improved survival opportunity for many terminally ill patients. Her contribution is greatly appre- ciated."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" i Contents F IGURES ........................................................................

The Witch Doctor, Medicine Man and Woman, Herbalist and Clinician are all alike in this respect. They wish to keep in- formation surrounding illness and wellness to themselves and away from the common person so that a profession of medicine can grow and become lucrative. The Herbalist did not tell which herbs could relieve cold s or bring on a woman's men- strual period (birth control) fo r fear that the people in need would get them for themselves and not need (nor pay) the Herbalist. The modern medical profession overlooks informa- tion on prevention; it tries to make self-help and simple treat- ments illegal. All for the same purpose: to build and aggrandize their profession. This seems inappropriate, especially where communicable or wide-spread illness is involved. This example is taken from a text on herbology: This [bath] is a safe and sane procedure and will prove most beneficial to those who are obese and desire to reduce safely. In combination with the internal treatment with decoction of Fucus , this course is worth considerable to very stout people, and should not be sold too cheaply. It is a grave mistake to put this scientific treatment in the same class as the many advertised nostrums on the market. It is also a mistake to let your patient know what you"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS xiv are using. If any do make this mistake, he will lose his client who will straight away go to a drugstore for supplies. 1 I believe hostage-holding of the sick is im- moral, fundamentally unethical, and needs to be stopped. Besides the moral issue, there is a practical issue. It would benefit society much more if th e sick person were quickly res- cued and helped back to productivity. A healthy society benefits each of us immensely. Likewise, an ill society injures us immensely, even when it is ha lf a planet away. With this book, I hope to give away as many secrets as I can about the cause and the cure of all cancers, letting the truth come first and “professional concerns” come last. The human species can no longer afford to make a business out of illness. Global travel reduces our planet to the size of our backyards. In order to keep our own backyards clean, the neighbors must keep theirs clean. So it is with keeping our bodies free of viruses, bacteria and parasites. We all must be free of them. The concept of h ealth as a narrow professional concern is obsolete. This book is intended as a gift to humanity. I make a plea to the public and private sector of the medical community not to suppress this information but to disperse it regardless of embar- rassment or liability from the simplicity and newness of the cure, provided only that it meets your standard of truth.   1 Shook, Dr. Edward E., Advanced Treatise in Herbology , Trinity Center Press, 1978, p. 172."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" xv Abstract/Summary The human species is now heavily infested with parasites, particularly the intestinal fluke Fasciolopsis buskii , the sheep liver fluke Fasciola hepatica , the pancreatic fluke of cattle Eu- rytrema pancreatica , the human liver fluke Clonorchis sinensis and the common roundworm, Ascaris . The increase in fluke parasitism is due to the establishment of a new “biological res- ervoir” in cattle, fowl and household pets. The increase in As- caris parasitism is probably due to harboring of household pets. At the same time, microcontamination of the human food supply with derivatives of the petroleum industry has occurred; these include solvents, antiseptics and numerous products used directly in the food industry. In the presence of isopropyl alco- hol, F. buskii can complete its entire life cycle in the human body, not requiring a snail as an intermediate host, as it usually does. Other solvents contributing to parasitism include benzene, methanol, xylene, and toluene which now occur as residues in our foods and pollute our body products such as toothpaste, mouthwash, lotions and cosmetics. These solvents are also contaminants of animal feed, and thus are responsible for es- tablishing the new biological reser voir or source of infection of flukes. Different solvents accumulate preferentially in different or- gans. Isopropyl alcohol accumulates in the liver, resulting in completion of the life cycle of Fasciolopsis in the liver. This establishes the malignant process, namely the production of the mitotic stimulant, ortho-phospho-tyrosine. Ortho-phospho- tyrosine and a variety of growth factors are produced in the human host organs, possibly for the parasites' own use, inad- vertently including the human tissue in its sphere of influence. The presence of an adult fluke in the liver signals the produc- tion of ortho-phospho-tyrosine in a distant organ.

The difference between persons who accumulate isopropyl alcohol and those who metabolize it promptly is the presence of aflatoxin B in the former. The coincidence of aflatoxin B and isopropyl alcohol in the liver results in the formation of human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG). HCG becomes widespread throughout the body and is follo wed by ortho-phospho-tyrosine formation. Aflatoxins are contam inants of our foods and may also be produced in situ by the growing mycelia of Aspergillus varieties. Such mycelial growth s are only seen in the presence of copper! Vitamin C is oxidized and rendered useless in the presence of the parasite, Ascaris . The killing of all parasites and their larval stages together with removal of isopropyl alc ohol and carcinogens from the patients’ lifestyle results in remarkable recovery, generally no- ticeable in less than one week. Cancer could be eradicated in a very short time by clearing our food animals and household pets of fluke parasites and by monitoring all food and feed for sol- vents. Stopping consumption of mycotoxins and ceasing expo- sure to copper, cobalt and vanadium is essential for tumor regression. Since developmental stages of the intestinal fluke are found in blood, breast milk, the saliva, semen, and urine and can be seen directly in these body fluids using a low power micro- scope, it follows that this parasite can be sexually transmitted and also transmitted by kissing on the mouth and breast feed- ing. However, the recipient would develop cancer only if iso- propyl alcohol were accumulated in his or her body.

Therefore, you have to cut it out or radiate it to death or chemically destroy every cancerous cell in the body since it can never become normal again. NOTHING COULD BE MORE WRONG! And we have believed that cancer s of different types such as leukemia or breast cancer have different causes. Wrong again ! In this book you will see that a ll cancers are alike. They are all caused by a parasite. A single parasite! It is the human in- testinal fluke . And if you kill this para site, the cancer stops im- mediately. The tissue becomes normal again. In order to get cancer, you must have this parasite. How can the human intestinal fluke cause cancer? This parasite typically lives in the intestine where it might do little harm, causing only colitis, Crohn's disease, or irritable bowel syndrome, or perhaps nothing at a ll. But if it invades a different organ, like the uterus or kidneys or liver, it does a great deal of harm. If it establishes itself in the liver, it causes cancer ! It only establishes itself in the liver in some people. These people have isopropyl alcohol (often abbreviated IPA) in their bodies. All   2 Cancerous cells are thought to have a special property called malignancy . This belief is based on scientific experiments which show that when cells are cultured in the laboratory, they become malignant in an orderly progression fr om initiation, through promotion, finally transformation. Transformati on is irreversible. The tissue is now “malignant” and cannot be changed back.

Flukes To understand cancer you should understand the basic facts about the human intestinal fluke. Its scientific name is Fas- ciolopsis buskii . Fluke means “flat”, and flukes are one of the families of flatworms. On the ne xt page is a photograph of the human intestinal fluke, made from a preserved and stained specimen so all the details are visibl e. It is as flat as a leaf.

They pass out of us with the bowel movement. The adult, though, stays tightly stuck to our intestine (or liver, causing cancer, or uterus, causing endometriosis, or thymus, causing AIDS, or kidney, causing Hodgkin's disease). Most of us get little lesions in our intestines from time to time. These tiny sores allow the eggs, which are microscopic in size, to be pulled into the blood stream (other parasite eggs get into the blood this way too). Some of these eggs actually hatch in the intestine or in the blood. The microscopic hatchlings are called mi- racidia and are the second stage. They swim about with their little swimmer-hairs. And of course , the liver whose job it is to dispose of toxins, will receive them and kill them as the blood arrives from the intestine. They have no chance to survive in normal people.

The liver is unable to trap and kill these tiny fluke stages. These baby-stages are actually allowed to make their home in the liver and other tissues. It is as if the immune system has no power to kill them. The flukes begin to multiply in people with isopropyl alcohol in their bodies! The miracidia (hatchlings) start to make little balls inside themselves, called redia 4 . But each redia (ball) is alive! It pops itself out of the miracidia and begins to reproduce itself. 40 redia can each make 40 more redia! And all of this out of one egg! This parasite is laying eggs and producing millions of redia right in your body! In your cervix or lungs, wherever your cancer is growing! These redia are swept along in your blood, landing in whatever tissue lets them in. Smokers' lungs, breasts with benign lumps, prostate glands full of heavy metals are examples of tissues that give the redia their landing permits 5 .   4 The Latin names are rediae (plural) and redia (singular).

Redia are nesting in the liver and other organs. Sud- denly they change their shape. They sprout a tail and can swim again. Now they are called cercaria 6 . The cercaria only need to find a place to attach. After they glue themselves to your tissue, their tails disappear and they be- gin to grow a “cocoon”. Now they are called meta cer- caria. Normally, this would hap- pen on a leaf growing near a pond, so the metacercaria de- velop an extremely thick shell around themselves to withstand the winter. Does the presence of the solvent isopropyl alcohol in your body dissolve this tough shell? That would remove the last barrier to the fluke completi ng its entire life cycle anywhere in your body!

NOT IN THE INTESTINE BUT IN YOUR LIVER! Now the cycle is complete. From egg to miracidia to redia to cercaria to metacercaria and then the adults! And all of them eating and sucking and devouring your vital body fluids. But this is not normal for flukes. Their normal life cycle goes like this: Stage Normal Life Cycle 1 Egg Expelled with bowel movement onto soil. Washed by rain into ponds. 2 Miracidia Hatches from egg in wate r. Has cilia, can swim vigorously and must find intermediate snail host in one to two hours or may be too exhausted to invade. 3 Redia Develop inside miracidia as little balls until expelled. Those are “mother” redia, and each one bears “daughter” redia for up to 8 months, all still inside the snail, and living on the fluids in the lymphatic spaces. Similarly, daughter redia are continually de- veloping cercaria. 4 Cercaria Have a tail, use it to exit from snail and swim to a plant. If the snail is feeding on a plant, cercar ia can latch onto plant with sucker mouth and start to encyst (form a “cocoon”) within min- utes. Tail breaks off and swims away to dissolve. 5 Metacercaria Two-walled cysts. The outer wall is very sticky. But as you eat the plant it is stuck to, the least pressure will break it, leaving the cyst in the mouth. The “almost unbreakable” inner cyst wall protects it from chewing, and t he keratin-like coat prevents di- gestion by stomach juices. Ho wever when it reaches the duo- denum, contact with intestinal ju ices dissolves away the cyst- wall and frees it. It then fastens itself to the intestinal lining and begins to develop into an adult. 6 Adult Lives in your intesti ne and can produce 1000 eggs per bowel movement and live many years. Fig. 10 Fasciolopsis' normal life cycle As you can see, humans typically are the host for just the adult stage, and then only in th e intestine.

Now YOUR cells will begin to divide too! Now you have cancer. Now You Have Cancer The presence of ortho-phospho-ty rosine is the beginning of your malignancy. Unless you act quickly to kill this parasite spawning machine, it will take over your body. But first, let's sit back and think for a minute. Why is this parasite multiplying feverishly in your organs instead of living quietly in your intestine? Because having isopropyl alcohol in your body allows its development outside of the intestine. A parasite is simply doing what all living things must do: survive and reproduce. It is not the fiendish nature of this parasite that has given you cancer. It is th e tragic pollution of your body with isopropyl alcohol that is at fault. And, of course, the in- festation of our food animals and household pets with fluke parasites. But we will come to this later. It is quite possible that the redia or cercaria produce the or- tho-phospho-tyrosine in order to help themselves divide while reproducing. Other growth factor s are produced, too. There are: epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), insulin-like growth fact or (ILGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF). These can also be made by bacteria. But only Fasciolopsis makes ortho-phospho-tyrosine. These growth stimulants are not intended to make your cells multiply at all.

Purge The Parasite, Cure The Cancer The good news is that when the fluke and all its stages have been killed, the ortho-phospho-tyro sine disappears. In 24 hours all ortho-phospho-tyrosine is gone! Your malignancy is gone. You still have the task of repairing the damage. But your cancer cannot come back. And you have won the battle for your life. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE BATTLE FOR YOUR HEALTH? Let us step back agai n into the nightmare of cancer. Why do the microscopic fluke stages choose the cervix or prostate or lung in which to settle for reproduction? Perhaps it is because this organ has developed “safety islands” for them, namely, precancerous tumors. A benign tumor has lost its im- mune power for you, so that it cannot catch and kill the tiny in- vaders. After all, there is is opropyl alcohol present, and many other toxins as well. The heavy metals copper, cobalt and vana- dium are there. Often mercury a nd nickel are there. Lanthanide metals like yttrium and thulium are there. These are known to cause mutations. Common toxins like arsenic from household pesticides are there. PCBs and Freon are there. Fungus is even growing there and producing patulin , a carcinogenic myco- toxin ( carcinogenic means cancer-causing; a mycotoxin is a toxin produced by a fungus). Is it just a coincidence that the parasite survives and reproduces itself best in your most un- healthy organs?"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 10 Clearly, you must do 3 things: 1. Kill the parasite and all its stages. 2. Stop letting isopropyl alcohol into your body. 3. Flush out the metals, common toxins, and bacteria from your body so you can get well. We have been taught to believe that every parasite is so unique that a different drug is required to kill each one. The better drugs, such as Praziquantel TM and Levamisole TM or even Flagyl TM and Piperazine TM , can each kill several worm varie- ties. But this is just not practical when dozens of different para- sites are present. We have dozens of different parasites in us! It would be best to kill them all together even though only the in- testinal fluke is causing cancer. Look at the case histories. It is not unusual for someone to have a dozen (or more) parasites out of the 120 parasites I have samples of (they are listed in The Tests ). You can assume that you, too, have a dozen different pa rasites. We are heavily para- sitized beings! Our bodies are large enough to provide food and shelter for lots of these free load ers. If they were settled on the outside where we could see them , like lice or ticks, we would rid ourselves in a flash. Nothing is more distasteful to the imagination than hordes of b iting, chewing, crawling, sucking creatures on our flesh. But what about IN our flesh? We cannot see inside ourselves, so we mistakenly assume that nothing is there. Herbal Parasite Remedies The Native American peoples knew that humans are parasi- tized.

I remember being forced to swallow a spoonful of sulfur and molasses and raw onion! How dreadful it seemed. But it redu ced the body's burden of worms and other parasites that we all have. Where have we gone astray? Why have we forsaken these wise practices? I have seen that eczema is due to roundworms. Seizures are caused by a single roundworm, Ascaris , getting into the brain. Schizo- phrenia and depression are caused by parasites in the brain. Asthma is caused by Ascaris in the lungs. Diabetes is caused by the pancreatic fluke of cattle, Eurytrema . Migraines are caused by the threadworm, Strongyloides . Acne rosacea is caused by a Leishmania . Much human heart disease is caused by dog heart- worm, Dirofilaria . And the list goes on. Getting rid of all these parasites would be absolutely impos- sible using clinical medicines th at can kill only one or two para- sites each. Such medicines also tend to make you quite ill. Flagyl is used for amoebas and Giardia ; when the correct dos- age is used, it can cause extreme nausea and vomiting. Quinine for malaria is quite toxic. Imagine taking 10 such drugs to kill a dozen of your parasites! Good ne ws, perhaps, for the drug mak- ers but not for you. Yet three herbs can rid you of over 100 types of parasites!

They must be used together as a single treatment. It is the green hull surrounding the nut of the black walnut tree that has this miraculous pa rasiticide. After it has turned black, it is useless. The large gr een balls fall to the ground early in the fall. In a week or two they will be black and decaying. Therefore, anyone wishing to make parasiticide must be careful not to let the critical time for harvesting pass. I encourage eve- ryone to make their own parasitic ides and to take back the re- sponsibility for keeping themselves and their families free of these tiny monsters. The recipe for Black Walnut Hull Tincture Extra Strength is given in Recipes (page 587). Note that it is a tincture (extracted using ethyl alcohol), not an ordinary extract (which uses water). The black walnut ex- tract that is available from herb companies is not potent as a parasiticide. It is black, not pale green, indicating that the criti- cal harvesting time had passed. Of course there is no time to make your own if you have fast growing or metastasizing can- cer. See the chapter on Sources . You will only need one 1 oz. (30 ml) bottle of the Extra Strength tincture to get started. If you have family members you will need more. While you are waiting for it to arrive, get your other two herbs ready: wormwood and cloves. Wormwood consists of the leaves of the Artemisia shrub. My recommendation is that you grow it yourself if you have any space to do so. Wormwood seed is available from seed catalogs, (see Sources ). The amount you need to cure a cancer is very small, yet you cannot do without it. But the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has regulated it as toxic! It is therefore unavailable in concentrated form from herb companies. The evidence for tox- icity accepted by the FDA must have been hearsay. I have never"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 14 seen a case of toxicity, not so much as a headache or nausea 9 . The toxic level must be much higher than is needed to kill these parasites. This shrub is called wormwood for good reason: it kills worms! There is quite a bit of confusion over which Artemisia is the true wormwood. Books and nurseries can be wrong, even though they assure you they are correct! Buy Artemisia ab- synthium for your garden. Wormwood goes back to antiquity and is mentioned in the Bible. If you grow your own, dry the leaves when they are in their prime. The leaves are greenis h gray and quite bitter. Nobody would accidentally eat too much of them. Adults may put them in capsules. For a child, crumbl e ¼ tsp. and stir into honey. I have not done experiments to be more precise than this. Wormwood capsules are available as a combination of Ar- temisia and other herbs (see Sources ). The third herb necessary to cure cancer is cloves. This is the common spice used in baking. It needs to be ground up in order to release its parasite killing properties. You can buy a can of whole cloves and grind them in a blender or grinder. Store- bought “ground cloves” do not work ! Their parasite killing properties have evaporated long ago. Ground cloves from a health food store or herb shop may not work either! They may have been ground years ago. If an herb company were to grind cloves and fill capsules with them right away and store the cap- sules in closed bottles, the potency of the herb would be pro- tected. Don't take these details for granted. You must question your source and get a satisfactor y answer or grind your own (see Sources ). You will need about 100 capsule s of cloves. To make your own, purchase size 00 (double-zero) capsules at a health food   9 Of course, the FDA cannot be ex pected to accept experiences such as mine.

It is much too strong; you may try mixing with home made yogurt or apple- sauce.) Size 0 capsules will also be acceptable. You now have: • One 30 ml bottle of pale green Black Walnut Hull Tinc- ture Extra Strength. This is 1 ounce, or six teaspoons, enough for three weeks if you are not very ill. • One bottle of wormwood cap sules (each capsule with 200-300 mg of wormwood) or ½ cup of Artemisia leaves gathered from a friendly neighbor's shrub. • One bottle of freshly ground cloves (each capsule with 400-500 mg cloves), or ¼ cup bulk powdered cloves. These are the only essential herbs you will need to cure your cancer. They will last thr ough the first 18 days of the Parasite Program. Two additional items, ornithine and arginine , improve this recipe. Parasites produce a great deal of ammonia as their waste product. Ammonia is their equivale nt of urine and is set free in our bodies by parasites in large amounts. Ammonia is very toxic, especially to the brain. 10 I believe this causes insomnia and other sleep problems at night and anxiety by day. By taking ornithine at bedtime, you will sleep better. 11 Arginine has simi- lar ammonia reduction effects but must be taken in the morning because it gives alertness and energy. Do not try to substitute drugs for herbs. Drug parasiticides can be extremely toxic, even in the small doses needed. Nor do they kill all the stages.

Every pet living in your home should be deparasitized (cleared of parasites) and maintained on a parasite program. Monthly trips to your vet are not sufficient.

After cooling, you may freeze most of it in several 1 cup containers. This is a month's supply. Put 1 tsp. parsley water on the pet's food. You don't have to watch it go down. Whatever amount is eaten is satisfactory. All dosages are based on a 10 pound (5 kilo) cat or dog. Double them for a 20 pound pet, and so forth. Pets are so full of parasites, you must be quite careful not to deparasitize too quickly. The purpos e of the parsley water is to keep the kidneys flowing well so dead parasite refuse is elimi- nated promptly. They get quite fond of their parsley water. Per- haps they can sense the benefit it brings them. Do this for a week before starting the Black Walnut Hull Tincture. 2. Black Walnut Hull Tincture (regular strength): 1 drop on the food.

You must kill whatever you can as soon as you can in order to save as many petals and leaves as possible! Tapeworm Disease We all have tapeworm stages in our bodies, probably going back to childhood when we ate dirt. Every tumor, benign or malignant, has a tapeworm stage in the middle of it, even in- cluding warts. Growing a tumo r around a tapeworm stage may be Nature’s way of protecting us from it! It is not normal for these stages to hatch and develop further. Their purpose is to stay dormant. And perhaps they do little harm this way. But I have found, using the Syncrometer, that tapeworm stages make malonic acid . This is a powerful inhibitor of your metabolism. It cripples your Kreb s cycle, the high gear of your energy-producing machinery. Dr. Otto Warburg found, in the early decades of the 20th century, that inhibitors of the Krebs cycle caused tumors to grow. 15 So it is very important to k ill the tapeworm stages in your body—and in your tumors—even though they are responsible for the neoplasm (tumor), not the malignancy. Cancer is a progression of developments. First, the mass is merely a benign growth, a neoplasm . It is instigated by a tape- worm stage. Later, the mass is invaded by the intestinal fluke causing it to become malignant.   15 The Metabolism of Tumors , Otto Warburg, translated by Frank Dickens, MA., Ph.D., Constable & Co., Ltd., London 1930."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 32 Tapeworm stages do not come unaccompanied, either. They bring some very harmful bacteria and viruses with them. In suf- ficient numbers, they can make you feel quite ill. Streptomyces , a fungus-like bacterium is one of the worst. Wherever I detect Streptomyces , a tapeworm stage is not far away. The herbal parasite program, taken in a very high dose kills many tapeworm stages. You simp ly take 8 tsp. Black Walnut Hull Tincture Extra Strength, rest for an hour, then take another 8 tsp. Black Walnut Hull Tinctu re Extra Strength. After each dose, take one tablet of niaci namide, 500 mg, to detoxify the alcohol. This treatment could make you woozy; do not drive a vehicle afterward. Also take 10 capsules of wormwood and 10 of cloves, slowly and carefully, to keep it all down. This treat- ment could save your life, if you are terminally ill. Yet, even this very high dose parasite program is not effec- tive against all tapeworms. Tough Tapeworms A few varieties of tapeworms, like Echinococcus granulosus and Echinococcus multilocularis , have larvae inside their larvae! And even these second generation larvae can have more larvae inside them . These internal larvae are shielded from all things that might harm them. That is undoubtedly why they are not eradicated by zappe r current or the very high dose of parasite herbs. The innermost larvae are called hydatid sand . Testing with a Syncrometer reveals that in some persons, unfortunate enough to have these tapeworm varieties, hydatid sand is still present and alive after all these treatments. E. granulosus is the most common variety to survive it all. It is found the world over, infesting sh eep, cattle, pigs, horses, goats, and dogs.

Certainly there is much less malonic acid produced. But the filamentous bacte- rium, Streptomyces , which accompanies each larva, does a great deal of harm. Streptomyces can spread through your body like a virus; perhaps it even hosts a virus. Streptomyces is not merely a nuisance-invader like Candida . Streptomyces uses up your nucleic acid bases, adenine and hypoxanthine. It makes nitrites out of nitrates, leading to nitroso compounds which cause mutations. It makes a strong protease that can digest your tissu es. It makes substances that stops protein manufacture by your cells. It makes ammonia out of your urea; just the opposite of what should be taking place. It has powerful immune suppressant action on T-cells.

They are ozonated olive oil and L-cysteine . We will discuss them shortly. But first, are there other parasites besides some tapeworms that can survive our treatments so far? Yes. Ascaris . The Curious Case of Ascaris If you do not get well after the herbal parasite program and the zapper treatment, you can assume you have either leftover tapeworm stages or survivor Ascaris eggs."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"P ART O NE : T HE C AUSE 35 Ascaris infests animals and humans from pole to pole of this planet. It is safe to say that all dogs and cats have it and all hu- mans have it from time to time. Domestic animals and humans each have their own variety of Ascaris , yet can host the other varieties, too. Horses have Ascaris megalocephala . Pigs have Ascaris suum . The human variety is Ascaris lumbricoides . As- caris does not attach itself to you, it hardly even moves. It sim- ply lies still in your organs absorbing nutrients and eventually filling up with eggs. When you kill Ascaris worms by zapping or with the herbal recipe, they are mortally wounded. They are dying, but the eggs inside them are not . They were sheltered. Within a day these trapped eggs begin to leave the dying worm. Soon hordes of eggs are dispersing in your body again! And in another 24 hours they are beginning to hatch into larvae. You can detect this as it happens with a Syncrometer and test-slides of eggs, larvae, and adults. Of course, you are zapping and taking the herbal parasite killers. But again, these do not penetrate the Ascaris body to kill what is inside . It could take weeks for the dead Ascaris to be totally disintegrated so no more eggs are being sheltered within. Surely, a few Ascaris eggs, still escaping into your body could not do much harm since the overall problem has been greatly reduced! This is not so. The eggs, even if unfertilized, may do more harm than the worms. Ascaris eggs bring three very important pathogens that spread throughout your body: Rhizobium leguminosarum , Mycobacterium avium/intracell- ulare , and the common cold virus, Adenovirus . A flood of these is responsible for night sweats and a general feeling of illness. As soon as the last Ascaris egg is gone, these pathogens are gone, too, and the following night becomes free of sweating. If your night sweats come back, you know Ascaris eggs are pres- ent again. And in 24 hours, unle ss you kill them, they will hatch into larvae and start the whole cycle over again."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 36 It takes about three weeks for large parasites like Ascaris and tapeworm larvae to disintegrate completely and be cleared from your tissues. If eggs or sc olices are continually released during this time, the cycle of infection cannot be broken. Fortu- nately, the same two substances that can penetrate tapeworm larvae can also penetrate Ascaris worms and mop up after them, whether dead or alive! Strangle The Stragglers Here is the three week Mop Up Program for both tapeworm larvae and trapped Ascaris eggs: • ozonated olive oil, 3 tbs. taken once a day. • L-cysteine, 500 mg, 2 capsules, three times a day. You can easily make your own ozonated oil . Purchase an ozonator (see Sources ) and a small bottle of olive oil. Pour off an inch or so. Attach an aerator to the end of your ozonator hose and drop it to the bottom of the olive oil bottle. Choose a ceramic or wood aerator, available at any pet store; the plastic varieties release benzene! The bubbles may make the oil flow over the top. In this case, pour mo re of it off. Turn the ozonator on before dropping the hose in the bottle. Ozonate for 20 min- utes or longer. When done, cap the bottle and store in freezer until you are ready to use it. It melts quickly when needed. Would other oils work? Possibly. I have not researched them, though, since they cannot be trusted to be free of benzene (petroleum) pollution. Measure your dose accurately. You may put it on vegetables and have it with your meal. Ozonated oil gives you no noticeab le side effects, but it should not be taken more than necessary. One could expect the"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"P ART O NE : T HE C AUSE 37 ozone to jump across from oil molecules to your fat molecules, aging them too soon. Fortunately, the dose is small and may be directed at the intruders before it is directed at you. The cysteine should be L-cysteine, cysteine hydrochloride, or simply free cysteine. Do not get D-cysteine or DL-cysteine which are unnatural. Taking this supplement gives a few people side effects, per- haps due to its penetrating antiparasite property. You could have fatigue, nausea, dizziness. If you have serious side effects, reduce the dosage. On the other hand, cysteine may make you feel better than you have in many months! The cancer sufferer is quite deficient in cysteine and suddenly suppl ying it could put the body into a state of euphoria. In this case, you may even double the dose! Cysteine has other important benefits for you. It counteracts the radiation we all get from living on this planet, called “background radiation.” This might even explain why supple- menting animals with cysteine had the effect of lengthening their lives substantially. Cysteine is a heavy metal detoxifier, perhaps through the formation of glutathione. It is a precursor to glutathione and deserves a permanent place on your supple- ment list. Nevertheless, supplementing with cysteine should not be overdone. Even if you have good si de effects, reduce the dosage after three weeks to one a day. If you had bad side effects, re- duce the dosage after two days to whatever you are comfortable with. After three weeks, you can assume that all leftover Ascaris eggs are gone. But you can’t assume this for tapeworm stages— some are still locked inside your gallstones! These can be reached with a series of ozonated oil liver cleanses (page 599).

Perhaps this species is also present, although I cannot test for it yet. In any case, I usually see all six species of Clostridium in the intestinal tract of cancer patients. Only in cancer patients have Clostridium species invaded the upper parts of the intestine, too, not only the lower parts, so much more isopropyl alcohol may be made. In fact the esopha- gus and stomach are frequently colonized as well! The Syn- crometer easily detects the isopr opyl alcohol being made in the intestines when Clostridium is present.

Of course the reverse may be true: isopropyl alcohol could be inhibiting detoxificati on of aflatoxin. Either way, if you stop eating moldy foods your aflatoxin B level will be zero. Some foods with aflatoxin B ar e beer, nuts, bread more than a few days old, overripe fruit, and many bulk grains. Surpris- ingly, very moldy foods like cheese show no signs of aflatoxin B.

If you can prevent tumors from forming at all, you would never have to worry about malignant ones. The Formation of Tumors A tumor begins as a small ove rgrowth of tissue. You may notice it simply because it presses against its neighboring organ giving you strange sensations. When it is examined or scanned, the doctor may call it an “adenoma” or “neoplasm,” or just plain “mass.” Although scientists have worked for 100 years on the causes of such little growths, there is no conclusive expla- nation yet. But by analyzing this little growth with the Syncrometer, its composition can be determined qualitatively. When its compo-"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 48 sition is compared to that of ot her masses, in other persons, in other organs, common denominat ors can be found. And if re- moving these common denominators for patients results in shrinkage of these benign masse s, a recipe for curing your “tumor disease” can be formulated. A brief sketch of how we see tumor disease progress will be given here so you can begin your healing and prevention pro- gram. The Cause of Tumor Disease These are the common denominators of all the masses or growths I have investigated, ev en including warts. There are only about a dozen, not hundred s upon thousands as we are told. • tapeworm stages • cobalt (the metal) • Ascaris worms • vanadium (inorganic) • Clostridium bacteria • malonic acid and derivatives • copper (the metal) • fungus species This is not an unmanageable list. Compared to the thou- sands of chemicals on the “carcinogen” list compiled by anti- cancer institutions, this is simple. What Do The Tapeworm Stages Do? We have already stated that they produce malonic acid or somehow cause it to be made by the host, which is us. Malonic acid stalls the Krebs cycle (t he major energy-producing mecha- nism going on within our cells) an event that leads to tumor formation. But that is not all. Tapeworm stages also host bacte- ria."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"P ART O NE : T HE C AUSE 49 One of the constant compani ons of tapeworm stages are Streptomyces , fungus-like bacteria. There are hundreds of spe- cies; they are well known for making streptomycin, an antibi- otic. But they should not be making such compounds in our tissues on a steady basis. The side effect of streptomycin is stopping protein formation. This is exactly what happens in the tumor. When Streptomyces are present, the Syncrometer can detect no RNA, which is the nucleic acid that leads to protein building. Healthy cells make RNA constantly. Ozonated oil plus cysteine is the best way to kill tapeworm stages because together they are also effective against Strepto- myces . What Does Ascaris Do? The primitive metabolism used by Ascaris (and other para- sites) is called the glyoxylate cycle . Ascaris’ glyoxylate cycle commandeers our Krebs cycle. (The Krebs cycle is what hu- mans use to burn food into energy.) Killing Ascaris stops this, and helps speed up our metabolism in a single day. Another thing that Ascaris does is to destroy all the vitamin C in the organ with the tumor by oxidizing it (removing a hy- drogen atom). To be useful, vitamin C must have reducing power (it must be able to pi n a hydrogen atom onto other com- pounds). When Ascaris is killed, vitamin C is immediately pre- sent again, and in proper reduced form. Ascaris harbors Rhizobium leguminosarum . We have been taught that Rhizobium is a rather lovable bacterium, busily changing nitrogen gas into nitrates in the nodules along the roots of legume plants. But in our bodies, the nitrate gets re- duced to nitrite, nitrites form nitroso compounds, and these cause mutations. Rhizobium is also capable of making DNA, which is necessary for tumor formation. Fortunately, killing Ascaris with ozonated oil plus cysteine also kills Rhizobium ."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 50 Another bacterium harbored by Ascaris is Mycobacterium avium/intracellulare (two species are mixed on my specimen). Although I have not discovered any of its metabolic pathways, it is easy to notice the big impr ovements in health when it is killed. Night sweats are immediately gone! Ascaris has still more tumor-related activities! To under- stand them you have to know a bout extensive studies done in the 1930’s. At that time the stru cture of cholesterol was being discovered, and some of its byproducts were suspiciously simi- lar to the coal tar products known to cause “cancerous tumors” in mice. Hundreds of coal tar products were studied over a ten year period, and one of the worst was 20 methyl cholanthrene . 20 methyl cholanthrene is considered one of the most potent carcinogens ever discovered. One tenth of a milligram (approximately 1/10 of a flyspeck) injected into the skin of a mouse, only once, could produce tumors up to 8 months later, filling the mouse with big round ba lls that ended its life. Just one dose! To my amazement the Syncrometer detects 20 methyl cholanthrene in tumor cells when Ascaris is also present! How have we escaped our demise by this route for so many years? We have hosted Ascaris from our early beginnings as humans, although having household pets is probably a new life- style. I don’t know the answer, but obviously eliminating As- caris infestation is a most important task. I believe it can be safely concluded that tapeworm stages and Ascaris together with their associated bacteria, initiate our tumor disease. Later, Clostridium bacteria and various toxins and “carcinogens” make their deadly contribution."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"P ART O NE : T HE C AUSE 51 What Does Copper Do? There is no tumor, benign or malignant that does not have inorganic (toxic) copper, that is detected with the Syncrometer. On blood tests, it is easily seen that non-food copper depresses the serum iron level. Ultimately copper is lethal because with- out sufficient iron (in a properly re duced state, kept that way by vitamin C) our detoxification systems fail, red blood cell for- mation fails, energy metabolism fails, we fail. Metallic copper comes into our bodies with water that has run through copper pipes, from metal tooth fillings, and from plastic tooth fillings polluted with copper. Copper has a great affinity for sulfur and uses up our chief sulfur compounds: glu- tathione, cysteine, taurine, and methionine. And eventually the sulfur that must stay combined with iron in our most vital or- gans is used up. Fortunately it is easy to eliminate toxic copper from our bodies by removing it from your water pipes and your mouth. Copper accumulation in cancer patients has been noted for a long time, but it was thought to be due to the cancer itself. My findings show the reverse, that copper accumulation causes tu- mor growth. And in fact, the accumulation, far from being due to the cancer patient’s genetic tendency, can be easily stopped just by changing the water pi pes and getting copper-containing tooth fillings removed. Copper le vels fall at once, letting iron levels come up in less than a week. Immediately blood building can resume. And as copper levels continue to go down, the in- vasive fungus growths also decline. What Does Fungus Do? Quite a few fungi and their toxic products, called mycotox- ins , have been studied in c onnection with cancer. The Syn- crometer routinely detects aflatoxin and patulin , which are mycotoxins, at the tumor site."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 52 Aflatoxin causes liver tumors. All cases of jaundice I have seen in liver cancer patients are due to aflatoxin. The only rem- edy I know of is to stop eating a ll grains and nuts, in any form. Other foods, especially fermente d foods, could be contaminated with it, too, because the mycotoxi n is not alive and is not dam- aged by cooking. Patulin also has a history of sc ientific research and use (as an antibiotic!). I routinely detect it at a tumor site, but its pre- ferred organ is the parathyroid. It plays a detrimental role in the body’s defense against tumors. Tumor Defense in the Body Every person I have tested who is without tumors, has tu- mor necrosis factor (TNF) in the parathyroids—but nowhere else. Every person with a tumor does not have TNF in the parathyroid glands. But the reason is clear. Patulin is in the parathyroids, somehow preventi ng TNF from being made. As soon as patulin disappears, and this could happen as soon as one day after killing the fungus and stopping eating it, TNF reappears in the parathyroids, r eady to go to work. No sooner is it back in the parathyroids but it shows up at the tumor sites, too, doing its best to shrink the tumors there. If you should eat or grow Aspergillus fungi again (the kind that make patulin), TNF immediat ely disappears. So it is rather a fragile system. Our habit of ea ting rotten fruit (not right off the tree) and letting fungus germinate in the intestine (constipation) keeps us inundated with patulin. The bruised parts of apples may have as much as 1 ppm patulin. 18 Stopping eating bruised fruit and clearing the bowel of fungus with Black Walnut Hull Tincture Extra Strength (two   18 Horubala, A., Influence of fungal metabolites on the quality of fruit and vegetables and on the quality of resultant products (Polish).

Now the tumors can shrink. But the forces favoring growth may still be stronger. What else is making them grow? Cobalt, vanadium, malonic acid, several bacteria varieties, and assorted carcinogens. What Does Cobalt do? Very little is known about cobalt toxicity. It was even given as medication in the past, for anemia. But the treatment was worse than the disease. Inorganic cobalt blocked oxygen utili- zation so that the body was fooled into believing it was at the top of a tall mountain, where the air is very thin (poor in oxy- gen). The body’s adaptation to altitude is to make more red blood cells. This appeared to cure the anemia by making more red blood cells. But blocking oxygen utilization has the same effect as being anemic, so nothing was gained. Long ago numerous scientists discovered an important fact. Any lowering of oxygen use by an organ favored tumor forma- tion in that tissue. A steady tric kle of cobalt to your tumor could be expected to support tumor growth. Another toxic effect of inorgani c cobalt is in the liver where the two main blood proteins are made: albumin and globulin . These two must be carefully re gulated since they control the osmotic pressure in the blood vessels. They must add up to about 7 gm/dl. The total may get much too high, such as 10 gm/dl in multiple myeloma, or much too low (below 6) when terminal illness has progressed. Cobalt raises the albumin too high and keeps globulin levels too low. These derangements can be seen on a standard blood test. The toxicity of cobalt to th e heart has been known for dec- ades; it was made illegal in nearly all uses then. But gradually it has reappeared in more and more products. By allowing it in"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 54 dish detergent and laundry detergent we now get a steady dose of it as a residue on our dishes and from our clothing which constantly massages cobalt into our skin. A ridiculously obvious and preventable source of cobalt is metal tooth fillings. But by replacing the metal with plastic, we have frequently not removed the cobalt! It is usually present, either as a component or contaminant of the plastic restoration. When both metal and plastics are meticulously removed, blood albumin and globulin levels correct themselves—often in just three days! And a life-threateni ng situation is turned around to recovery. What does Vanadium Do? Vanadium, like cobalt, causes the red blood cell count to go up—much too high. In fact, polyc ythemia (a rare “blood dis- ease”) is primarily vanadium toxicity. How this happens is un- known. But when the red blood ce ll count is over 4.7, for men or women, the Syncrometer always detects cobalt or vanadium “Non-chemical” laundry devices ac tually spew surface tension reducers into the water, including cobalt containing chemicals.

Vanadium is asserting its toxicity in other organs, too; in the liver, and in the tumorous organ. In the liver, vanadium toxicity has the opposite effect of co- balt toxicity. Now the albumin production is too low, while globulin goes too high. 19 Since globulin is less effective than albumin as an osmotic water attractant, water is allowed to leave the circulation and simply seep into the surrounding tis- sue. It is called edema and becomes a fatal condition. Vanadium is also the cause of the frequent mutations seen in tumors—in the p53 gene. It does this by combining with nu- cleic acid to make vanadyl complexes . A healthy p53 gene is necessary for the gene’s tumor suppresser action, which is to produce a substance that prevents tumors from forming. 20 By removing vanadium from your dentalware (both metal and plastic), the vanadyl complexes disappear and p53 gene muta- tions disappear, too. Then how could a patient wit hout any tooth fillings develop tumors? We have seen many ch ildren with cancers whose den- tition was intact. But their tumors were filled with vanadyl complexes! And as the disease became terminal the additional toxic effects of vanadium were easily spotted: much too low albumin and high globulin, and an exceptionally high red blood cell count. The children’s vanadium came from 1) chronic exposure to car exhaust (a source that constantly invaded their home), 2) a household gas leak, or 3) leaking refrigerant (I suspect fossil   19 One might expect that having both toxins would cancel the toxicity. Indeed, the blood proteins are often in normal range for can- cer patients, the problem being masked by this dual toxicity. But in other ways they do not cancel thei r toxicity, and each takes its toll on your health. 20 Sharon Begley, The Cancer Killer , Newsweek, Dec. 23, 1996, pp. 42-47.

These are important sources of vanadium for adults, too. Vanadium leaves the body, even from the vital organs, in a week after clean air is supplied and artificial materials are taken out of the mouth. These simple moves can turn around a termi- nally ill patient. What Does Malonic Acid Do? It is toxic, and a lot of re search has been done on it (see page 122). Malonic acid was found to inhibit the use of oxygen by animals (respiration) as ear ly as 1900! By 1930, Otto War- burg had found that anything that inhibited respiration could cause tumor formation. But it was never suspected that tape- worm stages release malonic acid, or that plastic teeth seep it, or that we even eat it in cer tain common foods. The Syncrome- ter detects it in every tumor (based on approximately 500 tests). New research is needed to clarif y the exact role it plays in tu- mor growth. What do Bacteria do? We have seen that some of these common denominators of tumors suppress our oxygen use. Some cause mutations. Some interfere with iron availability. Some lower our detoxifying ca- pability. Some destroy our vitamin C. Some drastically lower our immunity. Some prevent us from making tumor suppress- ers. But, in spite of all these tumor-promoting forces, a tumor could still not grow unless it had sufficient DNA to grow on. Imagine a garden. It has been tilled, seeded, fertilized, and is completely ready to grow. But each seed needs one more thing: water. For our cells to divide they must have DNA, the gene material with which each gene reproduces itself. Certainly, our cells can make their own DNA fr om RNA, but resources for"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"P ART O NE : T HE C AUSE 57 this are limited. And it occurs only in the nucleus, at an appro- priate time, at a pace that allows for replenishment of the RNA. In tumors, the Syncrometer detects DNA all the time . This may seem normal, because all of our cells have DNA, but I consider it abnormal because DNA is typically not detectable by the Syncrometer. Perhaps because it is buried in the cell nu- cleus. Only in tumors (and th e ovaries!) does it show up, lead- ing me to believe that when I do detect it, it is out of place and out of control. How can DNA (the “water”) be continually supplied for cell multiplication? The answer is bacteria . Only a few bacteria varieties 21 out of the vast numbers in- habiting this planet are able to make DNA using vitamin B 12 like humans do. These bacteria are certain species of Clostrid- ium , Rhizobium and Lactobacillus . (There may be more which I have not yet researched, but when these three are banished, DNA formation stops, and abnorma l cell division must cease.) These bacteria have found their way into the human body, par- ticularly the intestinal tract and dental crevices. And from there, when low immunity allows, they travel to the young tumor and colonize it. Clostridium is the hardest to eradicate. Evidently it invades the tumor cells and is not killed. Perhaps immunity is too low. Once inside, I suspect its DNA-making enzymes seep out into the cytoplasm where our copious amounts of RNA are, chang- ing it all to DNA. And with an ever present supply of DNA, the last requirement for unrestrained growth is met. So some bacteria can cause your “garden” to be “watered” in overabundance. Another bad thing bacteria can do is transport viruses into your cells. This is because bacter ia can themselves be infected   21 Geoffrey Zubay, Biochemistry , Addison Wesley Publishing Co., 1984, pp 706-707."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 58 with viruses. So when the bact eria manage to invade your cell by penetrating the membrane (not an easy job), the virus gets a free ride. Periodically viruses get released from those bacteria inside your cell, putting them in position to attack your DNA. When foreign DNA joins yours, it is called transformation . Scientists have studied transformation to determine when and how it causes tumor growth but don’t have all the answers. To me, it seems likely that bacteria and their viruses, such as we discuss here, are probably the transforming agents sought by scientists. Bacteria Implicated In Other Growth Factors Although the DNA-making bacteria seem most important, other common bacteria contribute to tumor growth. For instance if an organ tests positive to DNA, I assume tumorous growth is occurring. If that organ then te sts positive to CA-125 (a cancer marker), I know from experience the Syncrometer will find Salmonella typhimurium . Always. The conclusion is that S. ty- phimurium is a causative factor for both CA- 125 and the tumor.

How Benign Tumors Turn Fatal Tumor growth is a grand conspiracy between parasites, bacteria, fungi, copper, cobalt, vanadium, malonic acid, and assorted carcinogens! Yet the human body is big and strong. There are many mechanisms within our immune systems to fight these intruders. But if the tumor enlarges or new ones arise, we know these mechanisms are failing. We should be coming to our body’s assistance ra ther than shrugging it off as “merely benign.” At some time, the benign little mass may become malignant. This means that I observe ortho-phospho-tyrosine is present. Plus I always observe multiplying Fasciolopsis stages as well as isopropyl alcohol now. Did the Fasciolopsis stages suddenly discover the tumor the way a hermit crab discovers an unused shell? My detection of growth factors in tumors and even the pres- ence of a few fluke stages ther e suggests we should be much more concerned about them. Perhaps the distinction between benign and malignant tumors is deluding. Like the distinction between a loaded and unloaded gun. When ammunition is available, no gun should be ignored."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 60 We should really view tumor formation, or tumorigenesis , with the same caution as cancer, even though it is slow at first. It could begin to accelerate, doing more and more harm. Yet the body has coped with tumorigenesis a very long time, from the beginning of humanity, as evidenced by our body’s ability to produce tumor necrosis factor (T NF), tumor suppresser genes, and to repair mutations. What has gone wrong in the last cen- tury to permit such a flurry of tumors and cancers? Even though tumor growth is ancient, perhaps malignancy is a recent phenomenon. Perhaps this past century has produced the overload of heavy metals, solvents, and globetrotting para- sites required to spark this epidemic. Yet knowing what starts our tu mors gives us the power to stop them, whether benign or malignant. Preventing Tumors Will Prevent Cancer Tumors are complex structures, which appear to be asso- ciated with fungi, metals, bacteria, tapeworms, Ascaris and toxins. Being complex, you would think they would be fragile, and removing just one building block would topple them.

This is the practice of giving interferon, giving interleukin, giving thymosin, giving bacterial antigens, and giving many other entities to raise or stimulate the cancer patients’ immune powers.

Review As a result of our civilized lif estyle we live in petroleum- heated houses, drink water carri ed in copper pipes, eat food stored to the limit of freshness, wash our clothes in cobalt- containing detergent, are exposed to parasites we disperse all over the globe, place toxins in our teeth to constantly suck, and anoint ourselves with unnatural chemicals. Carcinogens pervade our modern environment. An overburdened liver gets an overdose of aflatoxin B, re- ducing its ability to detoxify isopropyl alcohol. Clostridium gain a toehold in your bowel, intensifying the isopropyl burden and causing it to accumulate. About this time human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), one of the first cancer markers discovered, appears. Next Clostridium and other bacteria invade one of your weakened organs, and start producing DNA. A small tumor starts to form. It is benign. The intestinal fluke, Fasciolopsis , facilitated by isopropyl alcohol, finds it can leave the in testine for the liver. And, it can reproduce itself from beginning to end inside your body (not needing a snail). Miracidia and other fluke stages swarm in your body. They produce a super growth factor, ortho-phospho- tyrosine, which makes cells multiply. The adult Fasciolopsis is in the liver but stages and growth factor are far away in the new tumor. It is now malignant. If solvents other than isopropyl alcohol are consumed, Fas- ciolopsis follows a different, non-cancerous, path.

Now the tumors aren't growing wildly, but they are not gone, either. They won't shrink until we remove the contributory problems. This will be a marvelous adventure. Getting well will be the most exciting part of your recovery. You will see yourself heal. Heali ng has a magic about it that is unique. It is the body's secret. No physician can make your body heal. No human being understands healing. But if you re- move all obstacles from your body, you can count on it, it will heal ! Remind yourself of a w ound you once had and how it healed. Splinters of glass or w ood had to be removed, dirt had to be scrubbed out. Bacteria had to be killed. Then, by unknown magic, it healed! Example of Healing Let us suppose you had lung cancer. Six days ago you started the fluke-killing recipe and threw away everything that had isopropyl alcohol in it, including shampoo and bottled wa- ter. Today the fluke and ort ho-phospho-tyrosine and cancer are all gone. You are coughing, t oo fatigued to go shopping, you"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 66 can't sleep and your mind dwells on the spots that were seen on your X-rays just recently. Can you heal them before your sur- gery date? Can you avoid chemotherapy? This is how you ac- complish both these goals in record time. 1. Stop smoking. Nobody in your house may smoke indoors. Your poor brain may cry out for nicotine. Take ginseng for a calming effect. Chew herbal combinations instead. Eat candy. Enroll in a smoke-out program. Try hypnotism. Pray. Do whatever it takes to succeed. There is no half- way measure. You must stop smoking. Put a sign on the outside door: “Recovering Smokaholic, Please Help By Smoking Outside.” Your lungs will begin to heal from the day you stop smoking. It takes 3 weeks of consistent healing for the tissue pathology to improve enough to change the doctors' minds about your need for surgery and chemotherapy. 2. Change your copper water pipes to plastic. If you only have a short section of copper this is easy and inexpen- sive. If you have all copper pipes with no control over them, move quickly into a new motel, one that has PVC (plastic) plumbing. There is no halfway measure with copper. There must be none in the laundry water, shower water, or dishwater. Filters or distillers cannot remove the amount of copper coming from copper plumbing. Filters were meant to remove the amount in municipal water. Even if you connect three filters in a row, they will all be letting copper through in a week. All cancer cases have copper water pipes, often unbeknownst to them. The fau- cets themselves and water heater inlets need not be changed. Nor any of the pipe s lying outside the water meter. I’m not sure why thes e don’t have more of an ef- fect. There is a new process available (see Sources ) in which an epoxy compound is blown through your copper plumbing."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"P ART T WO : G ETTING W ELL A GAIN 67 It coats the pipe, stops corrosi on, and best of all eliminates the copper contact. People say it makes the water taste so good they don’t buy bottled water anymore! I tested this water and could find no harmful elements. If you stop your copper exposure, you are re- moving one of the common denominators I find in all tumors. I also find copper in every cas e of leukemia, which means it is probably a factor in non-tu morous cancers also. (The only type of cancer that I have not seen a copper buildup with is Hodgkin’s disease.) So I think this shows the importance of avoiding copper: do not have copper plumbing; do not wear copper jewelry; do not use copper cookware, and get the copper dentalware out of your mouth. 3. Remove all the chemicals from your house. You may store them in the garage if and only if there is no door between garage and house. If there is a door, you lock it and cover it with a large sh eet of plastic so nobody can accidentally use it and let the fumes in from the garage. You remove everything from the basement, kitchen, bath- room. Remove all paint cans, paint or varnish removers, thinners, brush cleaners, even though they are tightly closed. Remove all containers of floor wax or cleaner or polish, and carpet or furniture or window cleaner. Remove nail polish and remover, tile cleaner, rust remover, wall cleaner. Every chemical must go. Keep only distilled white vinegar, borax, and baking soda as cleaning agents. I will tell you how to use them later. Remove all fragrances from the house. You may store them in the garage in clear plastic bags. Nobody in your"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 68 house may wear them. Remember, you have a deadline to meet to heal your lungs. To do this, you remove ALL chemicals. Fragrances are chemicals. This includes deter- gents, potpourri, colognes, ca ndles, room fresheners, wall lamps, soaps, lotions, after-shave, hair spray, anything that you can smell. 4. Board your pets with a frie nd. They should be started on a parasite program while at your friend's place. Pets carry Ascaris (roundworm), a parasite that goes to the lungs and the eggs are picked up by touching the pet's fur. Later on, when your doctor pronounces your lesions healed, you may give some serious thought to whether you should chance getting parasites again from a pet. 5. Get rid of any possible asbe stos sources. Put your hair dryer and clothes dryer in quarantine. There is asbestos, too fine to be measured by Pub- lic Health De- partment equip- ment, and there- fore more danger- ous, coming from two out of three hair dryers. Don't use one. Don't let the hairdresser use one on you. Don't sit inside a hair dryer or use hair curlers or you'll add tungsten as well as asbestos to your beleaguered lungs. Simply change your hair style. After you're in the clear with your health, buy a Conair Clothes dryers are our biggest source of asbestos. Check your dryer belt. It should state: “Made in USA” Fig. 22 Clothes dryer belt"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"P ART T WO : G ETTING W ELL A GAIN 69 Prostyle Mini 1250 TM , a 081.A 1600 TM , or a Vidal Sas- soon Misty Tone 1500 TM ; these tested negative to asbes- tos. Clothes dryers are our biggest source of asbestos. It comes from the belt . I suppose our government agencies feel it is safe enough to blow asbestos around inside the machine. However, it comes out through the cracks along the sides and around the exhaust outlet. Install a new belt. How can you pick a replacement belt that does not have asbestos? Choose a “Made in US A” belt. No belt that said “Made in USA” showed asbestos in my tests. All others did! Don't assume that because your clothes dryer is a U.S. brand name that your belt inside is also. Three belts that do not have asbestos are listed in Sources . Get a new exhaust hose for your clothes dryer, too, cleaning out all the dust in the machine while installing it; use duct tape around the outlets at both ends. Never exhaust the dryer into your house to save heat, even with a safe belt, because fresh air is best fo r your lungs. After this, have the whole house from basement to upstairs vacuumed and dusted while you are away for the day. 6. Have the house tested for radon. Buy a 5-day kit from a hardware store and put it in your bedroom. If there is any 22 radon, seal up the cracks in the basement. It is not very difficult to correct a radon problem. Since it takes weeks to get an answer back from the company measuring the radon from your kit, it would be best to go live somewhere else temporarily. Or just tackle the job of fixing cracks. Your lungs will not heal if there is any radon. Free pamphlets are available at drugstores to tell you how to seal your home against radon. They make the   22 Government standards allow a certain amount (4 microcuries per liter). This is not safe for a person with lung disease."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 70 job seem more difficult than it really is. Get a quart of black roofing cement and dab it around plumbing pipes and gas pipes where they co me through any walls. Dab it on cracks. After a few days, you can go over them with a more attractive caulk. Seal around plumbing pipes up- stairs too. Open your crawl space vents and leave them open year round. Don't try to save on your heating bill by keeping them closed. Install a crawl space fan. These measures nearly always work but if a follow-up 5 day test still shows any radon, you will need to move . 7. Remove all possible formaldehyde. If your bedroom is paneled, move out of it and keep the door locked. Move your bed into the cleanest room in the house—no wall- paper, no carpets except the washable kind and no stuffed furniture. Your bedroom should not be above the garage or facing a parking lot. If you have a foam mattress, or pillows, throw them out. Move all new furniture into the locked room out of circula tion. Wash all the new clothing hanging in your closets. Don’t wear them until they have been washed to remove the sizing, it has formaldehyde. 8. Remove all possible arsenic. Throw out (in outside gar- bage) any ant killer compound, roach killer, mouse-bait, spray bottle or can, lawn chemicals, house plant spray, every bit of pesticide. Steam clean the carpets yourself (see Recipes , page 586); at the same time clean the cloth furniture (stain resistant treatments contain arsenic). If you have it done for you, specify no “stain resistant” treatment and be present to check on the job being done. If there is new wallpaper, clos e and lock the door to these rooms or have it removed by someone else while you are away for the day. Wallpaper glue contains arsenic and must be carefully washed away. Don't do any painting or remodeling. Don't get new furniture, carpets, or cars."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"P ART T WO : G ETTING W ELL A GAIN 71 Much as you may love that new-car smell, it would be chemical suicide. 9. Check your home for exposed fiberglass. If your home is insulated with fiberglass, seal all holes in your ceilings or walls that lead to insulated areas. If your hot water heater has a fiberglass blanket, rem ove it. Also check for fiber- glass insulation around fans and air conditioners. 10. If you have gas heat or a gas water heater or stove, ask your local Health Department to come out to check for leaks. Your gas company does not have sensitive equip- ment to find small leaks. Also have a furnace repair per- son check your furnace and flue. Better yet, switch to all electric. Fossil fuels bring with them vanadium. Gasoline and car exhaust similarly bring vanadium. Keep these vapors away from your home. The biggest obstacle to all thes e changes is the feeling that you are not worth all this trouble. Of course, you are worth it! And what a fine example you ar e setting to family members by getting well. You are rewarding th em for their efforts to help you. And you are teaching them a valuable lesson about the toxic pollution of our environment. Your recovery will be an inspiration to everybody. You may be saving lives! Your total cost will probably be under $2,000. These changes will herald a new era in your life. I have seen every one of these tasks done in as little as one week when family and friends pitched in . Healing starts the day they are completed. Count how many times you cough in 5 minutes. It should go down to zero. If it does not go to zero, you have missed some- thing. Go over the whole list. Be more meticulous. Or go on vacation. You may go to a friend or relative’s house if they are willing to clean it up for you. This will get you away from as-"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 72 bestos, pets, Freon, copper, chemicals, and fragrance all at once (tell the maid not to spray for bugs, nor use air fresheners). If you get better while on vacation, stay on vacation. Never come back to your tumor-causing house. Healing In General What about other cancer types? Most of the healing tactics for lung cancer apply to other t ypes as well. But for each differ- ent organ affected you should focus on its special needs. For skin cancer, you would focus on laundry, soap, lotions and ul- traviolet light. Clothing rubs into skin constantly and always has detergent residue in it. Soap and lotions are chemical soups with isopropyl alcohol antiseptic. There are simple replace- ments for all of these given in the Recipes chapter. Getting well after any cancer depends on cleaning foreign things out of your body so it CAN heal. You have already re- moved all the parasites from your body and the isopropyl alco- hol. That was critical, but don't stop there if you want to get your health back. I have seen people get well whose doctors told them they had only 10% of their lung, or liver, or kidney still functioning! You can get all your health back from any kind of cancer by removing unnatural chemicals. 1. Remove all unnatural chemicals from your mouth. 2. Remove all unnatural chemicals from your diet. 3. Remove all unnatural chemicals from your body. 4. Remove all unnatural chemicals from your home."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"P ART T WO : G ETTING W ELL A GAIN 73 That is all there is to it. Let us look at each step, the mouth , the diet , the body , the home . Make a decision first: that you are worth the trouble. Now that the cancer is gone, your life is not in immediate jeopardy, but do you wish to get well? Do you wish to get rid of your bowel disease with its bloating and gas and discomfort? Do you wish to get rid of fatigue and feel like walking and working agai n? Do you want your strength back? What about pain? Do you wish to be free of foot pain, hip pain, low back pain, upper back pain, chest pain, knee pain, and other pain? Headaches, too, can be cured by cleaning up. If you had these health problems before the cancer struck, then you will still have them after the cancer is gone. Getting well again means getting rid of all the problems that brought you to the cancer, such as breast lumps, enlarged prostate, as well as problems resulting from the cancer, such as weight loss. 1. Clean Up Your Dentalware This section on dentistry was contributed by Frank Jerome, DDS, with comments added by th e author. To get an even clearer idea of how to make good dental choices, read his book, Tooth Truth (see Sources ). Dr. Jerome: The philosophy of dental treatment taught in America is that teeth are to be saved by whatever means avail- able, using the strongest, most long lasting materials. Long- term toxic effects are of little concern. The attitude of the ma- jority of dentists is: whatever the ADA (American Dental Asso- ciation) says is OK, they will do. A more reasonable philosophy is that there is no tooth worth saving if it damages your immune system . Use this as your guideline. The reason dentists do not see toxic results is that they do not look or ask . If a patient has three mercury fillings placed in"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 74 the mouth and a week later has a kidney problem, will she call the dentist—or the doctor? Will they ever tell the dentist about the kidney problem on tell the doctor about the three fillings? A connection will never be made. It is common for patients who have had their metal fillings removed to have various symptoms go away but, again, they do not tell the dentist. The patient has to be asked! Once the pa- tient begins to feel well they take it for granted, and don't make the connection, either. If everybody's results were instantane- ous, there would be no controversy. Dr. Clark: Some people are noticing that when they replace metal fillings with plastic they get tumors. It is too early to know if this is a coincidence. My recent tests show that most varieties of dental plastics c ontain known tumorigens as did amalgams, of course. In fact, I believe that toxic dental materi- als we suck on day and night ar e largely responsible for our cancer epidemic and the abnormal T-cell ratio in AIDS. So plastic fillings, at least the vari eties in use now, are not the an- swer. They are very toxic, too. Dr. J: Isn’t this somewhat of a bombshell? Dr. C: Not really, the fact wa s already known decades ago that even solid materials allow their water soluble components to leach out. That’s why fluoride is now added to tooth fillings: it is expected to leach out. When fillings have toxic pollutants or just plain toxic components, like urethane, maleic acid, or an azo dye they will leach out, too. And I find them in the tumors of a cancer sufferer. Dr. J: There is no perfect dental material. The best filling is never needing one. The question of toxicity is of degree. If a patient has a terminal disease, they will not be able to tolerate any contaminants. Fortunately, mo st patients are not in such dire circumstances. Finding the right dentist is y our first and most important task. The alternative dentists have been leading the movement"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"P ART T WO : G ETTING W ELL A GAIN 75 to ban mercury from dental supp lies. Not only mercury, but all metal needs to be banned. If your dentist will not follow the necessary procedures, then you must find one that will. The questions to ask when you phone a new dental office are: 1. Do you place mercury fillings? (The correct answer is NO. If they do, they won't have enough commitment to do removals properly.) 2. Do you do root canals? (The correct answer is NO. If they do, they do not understand good alternative den- tistry.) 3. Do you remove amalgam tattoos? (The correct answer is YES. Tattoos are pieces of mercury left in the gum tis- sue, or that settled on the jawbone as it was temporarily exposed during dental work.) 4. Do you treat cavitations? (The correct answer is YES. By cleaning them.) Cavitations are simply holes (cavities) left in the jawbone by an incompletely ex- tracted tooth. A properly cleaned socket which is left after an extraction will heal and fill with bone. Dentists routinely do NOT clean the so cket of tissue remnants or Find the black dot on each bone fragment. That is the tattoo, al- though the rest of the bone fragment that was removed is also discolored by amalgam. Fig. 23 Tattoos"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 76 infected bone. A dry socket (really an infected socket) is a common result. These sockets never fully heal. Thirty years after an extraction, a cavitation will still be there. It is a form of osteomyelitis, which means bone infection. Dr. C: An X-ray showing a cavitation is on page 90. I often see osteomyelitis (bone infection) in the rest of the body, par- ticularly in bone cancer. It always starts in the jaw bones due to some dental problem. It spreads fr om the jaw to the rest of the body. Amazingly, when we clean up th e jaw, other areas of os- teomyelitis clear up, too! Staphylococcus aureus is always pres- ent in cavitations. Dr. J: It will be very frustrating for people to find a dentist who can answer all four questions correctly. Most mercury-free dentists still use many metals in crowns. Many of these metals are carcinogens, such as nickel, chromium, and cobalt. These are the least expensive metals so it is a purely economic deci- sion for the dentist. Cavitations are done by very fe w dentists. Some state dental associations claim that they do not even exist and that it is mal- practice for a dentist to treat them. There are few training courses available and even then, dentists are reluctant to try to treat them. If a dentist says “Yes” to the first three questions and “No” to the fourth, they may still be a good choice. The dentist may be able to refer patients to an oral surgeon for treatment for their cavitations. Dr. C: Something else to be aw are of when looking for a new dentist: be considerate of the dentist’s feelings when you ask questions. Even the alternative dentist likes to “run the ship” his or her own way. If you can get answers more dis- creetly, as from a friend or th e receptionist, you might get better service. You should also inquire if the dentist uses a magnifying viewer or a camera and monitor device to spot tattoos. The"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"P ART T WO : G ETTING W ELL A GAIN 77 dentist will be delighted to an swer this question. It puts the dentist into the class of a select few who aim at perfection in their practice. Dr. J: If you choose a dentist who does not understand the importance of these questions, you could end up with new problems. Find the right dentist first even if you must travel hundreds of miles. There are 6,000 to 10,000 dentists who should be able to help. Some c an do part of the work and refer you to a specialist for the rest. Five hundred to one thousand of these dentists can do it all. Dr. C: What is the treatment for cavitations? Dr. J: To prevent a cavitation from forming in the first place, you clean the walls of the socket very carefully at the time of tooth extraction. They must be free of rough edges and bits of tissue; one must use tweezers to carefully remove every tiny bit that might still be stuck. For old cavitations that have become sealed into the jawbone, the simplest way is to make a small access opening. The cavitati on is flushed with antiseptic then cleaned using hand and rotating instruments. Then it is flushed again. They heal and fill w ith bone with few problems for the patient. Larger ones may require a second treatment. Dr. C: I recommend squirting in a dilute solution of Lugol’s iodine to sterilize the so cket instead of commercial an- tiseptic. Six drops in a quarter cup of tap water gives enough solution to clean up several cavitations or sockets. Dr. J: US dentists use standard antiseptics on just salt wa- ter. Why not stay with that? Dr. C: Nothing is as effective as iodine. We are dealing with very vicious bacteria here, not just Staph, which is friendly by comparison. I often detect six varieties of Clostridium bacte- ria, and assorted Streptococci . They have very tough shelled capsules, or spores, inside them. The capsules survive even when the microbe dies. Later the capsules hatch again. But io- dine kills the capsules, too. Tooth bacteria infect tumors; that’s"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 78 why I emphasize tooth bacteria so much. Lugol’s iodine is easy to make and quite cheap (see Recipes ). You don’t feel any stinging sensation, of course, because your mouth is anesthe- tized. Dr. J: What about antibiotics? Dentists everywhere rou- tinely use antibiotics to help after-procedure healing. It seems quite effective. Many use antibiotics to protect themselves le- gally, of course. Dr. C: Clostridium bacteria in the jaw bone do not respond well to antibiotics. They return as soon as the antibiotic is stopped. That is because the wound is rather deep, and there is very little oxygen deep down. This is the classical setting for Clostridium . Our “home remedy” antibiotic works better than commercial varieties (see page 102). What often helps as much as antibiotics is just getting every iota of metal and plastic out of the mouth. This in itself re stores the mouth immunity so suddenly that infections don’t develop. It’s quite remarkable. Dr. J: The simpler the dental treatment, the better. If the dentist says that he or she can remove your metal fillings but this would leave such a big hole it would be better to CROWN them, say “NO!” A crown is a prescription for disaster. The tooth has to be drilled down to a nubbin to fit the hollow cap (crown) over it. Dr. C: The space between that nubbin and the cap is sup- posed to be completely filled, so no space exists for bacteria. But actually, that doesn’t happen. Every crown I have seen re- moved revealed a gray to black tooth zone. This is where the Clostridium was growing right into the tooth. Since Clostridium is a “tumor microbe”, that is, it can change RNA to DNA, such infected teeth must be quickly ex tracted for very sick patients. The infection is in the tooth, not on the tooth. You can assume that every crowned or capped tooth has gross infection under- neath. The tooth cannot be cleaned up. Crowned teeth and capped teeth must be extracted."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"P ART T WO : G ETTING W ELL A GAIN 79 Dr. J: That’s a lot of extractions for some people. Dr. C: Yes. A mouthful of caps or crowns must be ex- changed for dentures or partia ls. They should not have had crowns put on in the first place. Of course, the hazard was not known at that time. Dr. J: Would you suggest different dentistry for healthy and sick people, then? Dr. C: I suppose we do this unconsciously, already. When we are sick we stop our bad hab its and risk taking. Later, when we are well we return to them. But it isn’t logical. It’s only a matter of time when we must co rrect our mistakes. A sick per- son has only weeks to root out the sources of his or her body’s infections, while those who still feel well may have years re- maining, depending on body immunity. Dr. J: What do you do for yourself? Do you have metal or plastic in your mouth? Dr. C: All my large plastic fillings became extractions. I plan to fill the back spaces with partials. At present, there is no filling material safe enough to k eep permanently in my mouth, These teeth with their crowns re moved reveal a black surface un- derneath and fine gray lines of further invasion of the tooth.

They are aware of the toxicity problem from plastics and may be the first to solve it. Dr. J: What about the front teeth? Are you carrying plastic in them? Dr. C: No, I simply had the pl astic taken out by air abrasion. This avoids enlarging the original hole. I am keeping the holes empty and very, very clean. Pe rhaps a new non-toxic plastic will be developed soon. In fact, I was hoping you would develop it. Dr. J: So you took out the plastic I so artistically put in 13 years ago? Dr. C: Yes, and I am happy to tell you I had no Clostridium infections under them. So it can be done! Maybe your technique was superior. Maybe no open dentine was involved, only enamel! The technique being us ed everywhere else, though, has to be much better before it is acceptable. Dr. J: Then why did you remove them? Dr. C: When I originally tested the composite you were going to use for me, I found it free of heavy metals but I didn’t test for urethane and bisphenol-A. And I didn’t test the base/liner and other little adjunctive materials a dentist uses be- sides the composite. These become part of the restored tooth and leach their toxins constantl y. So my fillings were seeping copper, cobalt and vanadium which I detected in my retina and optic nerve. In addition I detected mercury and silver that was stuck under the plastic fillings—the remains of my previous amalgams. But they came out with the air abrasion. Dr. J: Do you think that small amount matters? Dr. C: That tiny amount makes the difference between re- covery and no recovery for the very sick patient. In healthier people you don’t notice the health boost."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"P ART T WO : G ETTING W ELL A GAIN 81 Dr. J: Since you are now extracting mercury-filled teeth in- stead of refilling them with plastic, do you use any special pre- cautions? Dr. C: Extractions should be done carefully, so the amal- gam doesn’t break up, letting little pieces get away to lodge in crevices in the gums or bone or the hole itself. In Mexico we routinely refer the patient to an oral surgeon for extractions and to a dentist for air abrasion cleaning or temporary cement fill- ings. Dr. J: No dentist in the US woul d extract a tooth just be- cause it has a large amalgam filling in it. Dr. C: The amalgam is very toxic. The available plastic re- placements are toxic, too. But to prove this, you would need Syncrometer technology, searching for metals in the bone mar- row, spleen, thymus, lymph node s. That’s where it’s killing you by blocking iron metabolism. It doesn’t chelate out. Your choice is to succumb to illness or extract. Extractions are life- saving. Patients will need to go to foreign countries for their dental work. Dr. J: How could you convince a seriously ill patient to do that? Dr. C: Words are not convincing so I don’t try too hard. But if an MS patient who is di sabled sees another MS patient gain ground after tooth extracti on it is quite convincing. The results come so quickly that there is no argument. Likewise, for the cancer or AIDS patient. They may be concerned about the “stress” on their bodies from extractions. But when they see similar patients start to eat again, get dressed or go for a walk within days after getting their extractions, it doesn’t take per- suasion. It’s seeing the miraculous recovery of others in the same hopeless situation that’s convincing. In fact, I have heard patients say, “Who needs their own teeth in a wooden box?” Dr. J: What percentage of patients give such a dramatic re- sponse?"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 82 Dr. C: All of them, 100%. Evidently, toxic dentalware was a large part of each person’s probl em. The patient has run out of detoxifying capability for heavy metals in certain vital organs, and the tiniest bit now tips the scales, even tattoos. The front teeth must be cleaned out carefully, as well, because the plastic still has metal (copper, cobalt, and vanadium). After this, all the teeth are polished clean with th e same air abrasion device using baking soda (instead of aluminum oxide). Baking soda will combine with metal oxide in crevices and do a perfect job of cleaning up after amalgam. You do the same for plastic fillings. A dramatic response only comes after the entire job is completed. Remember to wait until your gums are healed over before doing the air abrasion of front t eeth, otherwise particles could lodge in the wound site. It takes four to six days. Dr. J: You advise using a rubber dam, don’t you? Dr. C: Yes, a rubber dam plus a su ction device to keep bits of loose amalgam from swimmi ng away to other locations, hiding under gums and settling in ex traction sites never to be found again. That’s disastrous. Dr. J: How do you fill these new holes left after removing metal and plastic fillings? Dr. C: You don’t. Dr. J: Don’t they get infected? Dr. C: Not in half a year’s time. That’s plenty of time to get well in. After the patient is well, some risk-taking comes to their mind again and they are determined to fill the holes. After narrowly escaping death, though, would you risk putting any- thing even slightly suspicious back in your mouth to suck on continuously? Dr. J: The answer to that is easy; no, of course. But what about infection? Don’t all the open teeth start to ache? Dr. C: No, they don’t. Patients treasure these last teeth.

Ask for the panoramic X-ray before starting dental work The panor amic X-ray shows the whole mouth including the jaws and the sinuses. This lets the dentist see impacted teeth, root fragments , bits of mercury buried in the bone and deep infections. Cavitations are visible in a pano- ramic X-ray that may not be seen in the usual tooth by tooth “full mouth series.” Dr. C: Here is a sample of a panoramic X-ray. A print of an X-ray reverses the light and dark areas. Since you will be comparing this prin t with your own X-ray, you must convert light areas on the print shown here to dark areas on your X-ray.

First find the angles of your jawbone, noting left and right side and top and bottom. Use a hand magnifying glass to study it. You Be The Judge It doesn’t take an advanced degree in dentistry to judge whether it is a good or bad X-ray. Are all the root tips visible? If not, you wasted your money; you got the panoramic so you could see the root tips and beyond! Since the X-ray can be viewed right at the time it is made, you can request a retake (it costs very little extra). This particular X-ray should have been done over, because looking at the upper teeth no root tips are visible. The mouth was not correctly positioned for th e X-ray. Also, the teeth at the ends are a solid black, so nothing can be deduced about them. The intensity setting on the X-ray machine was not correct for them. A duplicate X-ray at a different setting would have been wise. Next, look at the lower teeth: The root tips are on the print, but not very clear. The X-ray machine produced two dark verti- cal lines at the centers, obscuring the roots further (a good rea- son to get it redone on the spot ). Under each end-tooth is a roundish white spot. On the X -ray film, which you would be examining, these would be dark spots. These are the holes in the jawbone that allow the nerve and blood vessels to pass through. Note that a tooth was pulled three months ago on the lower left side. The bone has alr eady filled in almost to the top, so that a nearly flat line is s een to mark the ridge of the jaw bone from one side to the other. Locate the center.

The center on the upper side is easier to find; see the arrow. The fifth tooth from the cente r at upper left has a black cloud emerging from the root tip like a swarm of gnats above it. This is an infection, the bact eria are parading up towards the brain. Brain tumors are made of such events. Trying to save such a tooth would be a bad mistake, even though it “looks good and was giving no trouble.” Plas tic (black edges) can be seen on the inner edge of the t op center teeth; this was done for cosmetic purposes. A few more bits of plastic are seen here and there. No cavitations are seen in the bottom half where the visi- bility is good. A large tattoo did not show up on this X-ray although the dentist spotted it easily while working on the mouth.

Notice the round white spot (black on the X- ray film) just above the R. This was an abscess, far removed from the teeth, but probably ste mming from a dead or infected tooth. An X-ray cannot identify dead teeth. They should have been tested for vitality. A dead tooth always harbors Clostrid- ium . Such a “silent” infection will reach vital organs such as thymus, bone marrow, and spleen, besides the tumor! All dead teeth should be extracted. The last panoramic, although poor quality, shows a large cavitation at the lower right. One or two teeth extracted there long ago left a large hole with infection (dark area) along the sides.

Dr. J: White areas on the print (black on the negative) are either overlapping teeth or plastic fillings. The dentist is the best judge of this. Ask the dentist to interpret them for you. Dr. C: We are accustomed to thinking that plastic is metal- free. This is wrong. Modern plas tic contains metal both as com- ponents and as contaminants, even including mercury. A possi- ble explanation is that manuf acturers are using recycled chemicals. It is particularly important not to get copper, 24 co- balt, or vanadium seeping from the plastic since these cause bone marrow, liver, spleen, and t hymus toxicity. They diffuse out into the saliva and from ther e to the tumor or other unlucky organ. Most of the time metals are purposely added to the plas- tic to make it harder and give it sheen or color. Dr. J: The chief reason is a frivolous one; so the fillings are visible on X-rays! Dentists are not given information on metals added intentionally. The information that comes with dental supplies does not list them either. Many are listed on the Mate- rial Safety Data Sheets (MSDS). Dentists are required to keep these in their office.

Dr. C: The pink color is from mercury, cadmium, or scarlet red dye which is added to the plastic. This dye is also called Sudan IV , and is a potent carcinogen. It was used by surgeons in World War I. Rubbing it into the wound made it “heal” faster. Much later, it was noticed that tumors grew from the wound and the practice was stopped. 26 Plastic teeth that are made from methacrylate do not have metal, maleic, bisphenol, scarlet red dye, or urethane pollution. I tested many with the Syncrometer. Dr. J: I think the reason methacrylate products are not pol- luted is that the supplies for making them consist of only 2 bot- tles, one with powdered methyl methacrylate and one with the liquid “monomer”. The monomer is a two-molecule bit of methacrylate which forms the solution. Powdered methacrylate is added to the liquid according to the recipe and the whole thing polymerizes into a solid.   26 Greenstein, Jesse P., Biochemistry of Cancer , 2 nd edition, Academic Press, NY, 1954, p. 88.

Dr. J: It’s an old truth: If the public demands plastic resto- rations that don’t leach toxins and that adhere to the tooth without microleakage, the industry will develop it. The secret is in the public being knowledgeable about the issues. People could organize their own safety groups and exchange informa- tion.

Horrors Of Metal Dentistry Why are highly toxic metals put in materials for our mouths? Because not everyone agr ees on what is toxic at what level. Just decades ago lead was commonly found in paint, and until recently in gasoline. Lead was not less toxic then, we were just less informed!

You can do better than the government"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 98 by dropping your standard for toxi c metals in your mouth to zero! Simply remove all metal. The debate still rages over mercury amalgam fillings. No one disputes the extreme toxicity of mercury compounds and mercury vapor. The ADA feels that mercury amalgam fillings are safe because they do not vaporize or form toxic compounds to a significant degree. Opponents cite scientific studies that implicate mercury amalgams as disease causing. Many dentists advocate mercury amalgam fillings simply because they are ac- cepted by the ADA, which they believe protects them from malpractice litigation. Why risk your health and life on their opinions? Remember everything corrodes and everything seeps, so dental materials must too. Amalgams also contain copper, cobalt, and vanadium. This combination at a steady slow tric kle from our teeth, poisons the liver, bone marrow, thyroid, thymus, spleen and parathyroids. These organs have regulatory f unctions: they must regulate how much albumin or globulin is ma de, how high or low the calcium level goes, and so forth. These regulatory organs have active centers containing iron and sulfur. Evidently the heavy metals compete with these to knock out the regulatory center. When these organs fail we die. We die from anemia, heart failure, edema, uremia or sepsis, although technically it is called cancer or AIDS. Often mercury amalgam tooth fillings also test positive to thallium and germanium with th e Syncrometer. Inorganic ger- manium is extremely toxic, while thallium causes leg pain, leg weakness, and paraplegia. If you are in a wheelchair without a very reliable diagnosis, have all the metal containing teeth re- moved from your mouth . Don’t try to restore them. Search carefully for tattoos.

The le thal dose for a man by inges- tion is 0.5-1.0 gram. Effects are cumulative and with continuous exposure toxicity occurs at much lower levels. Major effects are on the nervous system, skin and cardiovascular tract. The pe- ripheral nervous system can be severely affected with dying- back of the longest sensory and motor fibers. Reproductive or- gans and the fetus are highly susceptible. Acute poisoning has followed the ingestion of toxic quantities of a thallium-bearing depilatory and accidental or suic idal ingestion of rat poison. Acute poisoning results in swelling of the feet and legs, arthral- gia, vomiting, insomnia, hyperesthesia and paresthesia [numbness] of the hands and feet, mental confusion, polyneuritis with severe pains in the legs and loins, partial paralysis of the legs with reaction of degeneration, angina-like pains, nephritis, wasting and weakness, and ly mphocytosis and eosinophilia.

Are mercury suppli- ers then providing the dental industry with tainted amalgam? Who tests for the purity of dent al mercury? What is tested for? As recently as 1972, mercury was considered pure if you simply looked at it. The purity of dental mercury in the American Dental Asso- ciation specification is defined by its surface appearance, its residue after pouring and its nonvol atile residues. The tests for surface appearance and pouring residue can determine the pres- ence of 0.001 percent or more of base metal impurities. The ad- dition of 0.00 1 percent of copper, zinc, tin, lead, bismuth, cadmium, arsenic or antimony caused an immediate change in the appearance of the surface of mercury. The mercury lost its mirror-like appearance and a film or “skin” formed on the sur- face. The contaminated mercury wetted the glass container and the container could not be completely emptied. The effect was very pronounced and could be r eadily detected in each case.   27 Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials 7th ed. by N. Irving Sax and Richard J.

Nickel is used in gold crowns, braces and chil- dren’s crowns! Note that the form of the metal is very important. Some metals have an essential/toxic duality.

They come originally from the crevices under plastic tooth fillings. Antibiotics are not successful in such a task because they only inhibit the bacteria until your immune system has time to rally and mount a big response. In a cancer patient, this immune response never happens. And as soon as the antibiotic is stopped, new, more serious bacteria surface to bewilder and defy attack. A very vigorous program is needed to clear up infection af- ter the infected teeth are pulle d because deep wounds are the preferred locations of Clostridium . Just removing the tooth does not automatically clear up the small abscess at the tip of the root, even with antibiotics. Not when Clostridium is the inhabitant. Cleaning the socket thor- oughly can prevent Staphylococcus invasion but does not pre- vent Clostridium invasion which is deeper down. This Dental Aftercare program is successful in killing Clostridium , Staphylococcus , and Streptococcus bacteria all to- gether. ( Streptococci go to your joints to cause arthritis.) You will need: • A water pick. • Lugol’s iodine solution (see Recipes ) six drops in ½ glass water four times per day. • Colloidal silver (see Sources ), take as directed by pro- vider. • Inositol, a supplement, 500 mg, take two four times a day. • Betaine hydrochloride, a supplement, about 300 mg (see Sources ), take two three times a day."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"P ART T WO : G ETTING W ELL A GAIN 103 • Baker’s yeast cakes (keep refrigerated) ½ cake once a day with breakfast. • Raw garlic, one clove a day, or germanium (carboxyethyl germanium sesquioxide only, see Sources ) one a day. • Hot water. Acquire these before your dental appointment. Practice us- ing the water pick and making the colloidal silver. The most important of all these is the hot water! The immune power of your arterial blood is much greater than in your veins. How can you bring arterial blood into the jaw area to heal it faster after dental work? Simply by hot- packing it from the start! The first day of dental work is critical. If you miss this, a massive spread of infection can occur because the mouth is al- ways a “den of bacteria,” and the abscessed teeth are themselves the source. As soon as you get home from the dentist you need to bathe your mouth with hot water. The heat brings in arterial blood. Swish gently. Keep the cotton plug in place for you to bite down on and reduce bleeding, even while swishing. Don’t suction the water around your mouth, you could dislodge the clot that needs to form in the socket. Gently move the hot water about your m outh. At the same time apply a hot pack to the outside of your face where the dental work was done. Wring a wash cloth out of the hottest water you can endure. Or fill a plastic baggie halfway with hot water, zipping it shut securely. Do this for 30 minutes four times a day, for a few days. Then three times a da y for a week—even when there is no pain. Don’t suck liquids through a straw for 24 hours; the sucking force is especially risky, it could dislodge the healing clot. Don’t allow your tongue to suck the wound site, either; and don’t put fingers in your mouth .

But you could"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 104 introduce the bacteria yourself, by eating , and by putting fingers into your mouth. Consider your mouth a surgery site. Anywhere else on your body, the surgery site would be scrubbed first, then painted with iodine or other st rong antiseptic, and later sprayed again and bandaged to keep everything out—certainly food particles and fingers! But the mouth cannot be bandaged and you must eat! So eat a big meal just before your dent al appointment. Afterwards, for the rest of the day, drink only cl ear liquids, such as tea with honey or confectioner’s sugar. You may need a pain-killer on the first night; choose a non-aspi rin variety to minimize bleed- ing. Take the supplements described above. Bleeding should be considerably reduced by bedtime. The cotton plug put in your mouth by the dentist may be thrown away. However, if bleeding is still substantial, make a new plug for yourself by rinsing the fres h gauze the dentist gave you, then rolling it into a wad shaped like your finger. If the dentist did not give you any gauze, use paper towel. Place the wad on top of the bleeding gum and bite down hard. The next day you need to be well fed, yet without eating solids or liquids with particles in them. The particles lodge too easily in your wound. Your choices are: 1. Chicken broth, strained, skimmed of fat. 2. Milk, boiled, cooled with vitamin C added. 3. Eggnog, made with boiled milk. 4. Plain ice cream made with boiled cream (see Recipes ). 5. Pudding made with cornstarch or flour. 6. Fruit and vegetable juice, strained. Immediately after “eating” (drinking), water pick your mouth with very hot salt water.

Water picking never dislodges the healing clot, only strong suction or infection dislodges it. Continue taking the supplements described above. If pain increases instead of decreases on the second day, you have an infection. Water pick continuously for an hour! If the pain subsides, the infection has cleared. Water pick until the pain is completely gone. It could take four hours! On the third day you may dri nk blended food (particulate); do not try to chew solids. Water pick after each meal. Floss the front teeth and brush them with white iodine or colloidal silver (hydrogen peroxide is not strong enough). Continue taking the supplements described above. If the pain level is increasi ng and water picking has not suc- ceeded, you must hurry back to the dentist to search for food particles. He or she will open the wound and clean it out again. Continue to hot pack, hot sw ish, water pick, floss, brush, and take the supplements for one week.

Assuming no problems, however, you may reduce the suppl ements by half and stay on them for three more weeks. If your dentist carefully cleans the sockets and rinses them by squirting Lugol’s solution into them, and if you are doing the Dental Aftercare program consci entiously, you will not need an antibiotic or extra pain killer.

Mother Nature provides milk for this purpose. Goats’ milk or cows’ milk has the extra calcium (one gram pe r quart) you now need. But milk can not be consumed as it arrive s from the grocery store. Many harmful bacteria ride along fr om the dairy barn, through the milk tanks and into your milk container. Salmonellas and Shi- gellas are two very harmful bacteria always found in every milk sample I test. Clostridium and Rhizobium are other common types. Besides bacteria, one can find eggs of parasites, such as tapeworms and flukes in milk. And since cheese, yogurt, ice cream and butter are made from milk, they too are contami- nated, in spite of pasteurizati on. Of course, you could test your dairy products with a Syncrometer to try to find a good one. But there is a simple way to correct this sanitation problem. Boil the milk with a pinch of salt. Ten seconds is minimum. This would not be long enough for some exceptionally hardy"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"P ART T WO : G ETTING W ELL A GAIN 107 bacteria, but it is enough to kill the tapeworm cysts and bacteria varieties I commonly detect. The salt raises the boiling tem- perature just enough to kill Rhizobium leguminosarum , too, which is extra hardy. Milk also has traces of mal onic acid, a strong metabolic in- hibitor, and boiling does not detoxi fy it. It must be detoxified with a small amount of vitamin C powder, 1/8 tsp. per pint. This could curdle some milk, so an equal amount of baking soda may be added first. These treatments actually improve the flavor. Persons with anemia should buy raw milk in order to obtain the factor, lactoferrin . Raw goat milk is best because it has some of the same factors as shark cartilage in addition to lac- toferrin. It must still be boiled. (More on lactoferrin and treating milk under Clean Up Your Diet, page 117.) Besides milk, canned salmon or other fish also have extra calcium you need to heal dental work. It is in the bones. There are numerous tiny bones, too sma ll to see or taste throughout fish. So, to upgrade your dental h ealth, begin by increasing your calcium intake with milk and fi sh. You need one to two grams of calcium (elemental) per day. One quart of milk has one gram. For canned fish, read the label. Make up any deficit with a safe calcium supplement (see Sources ). Get the extra magnesium you need from leafy green vege- tables plus a supplement (magnesium oxide, 300 mg daily). Eat a green vegetable every day, during and after dental work. You may need to blend it in a blender until your dentures or partials are ready. There are three hazards with eating greens: pesticides, As- caris eggs and sprays. If you are not sure whether pesticides have been used, then only buy Swiss chard, cabbage, collards (large leafed greens) that can be easily washed. Eat them every day or make coleslaw or raw salad."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 108 To kill Ascaris eggs and any other live parasite stuck to the greens, you must briefly soak th e greens in iodine-water. One drop of Lugol’s iodine in one qua rt of water is strong enough to kill on contact. If you leave this out you will have wasted the Mop Up parasite program. (It would be better not to eat greens!) All the lettuce, cabbage, and strawberries I tested had live Ascaris eggs, even after washing. Evidently, the fertilizer used on these crops is raw ma nure! A one minute soak in Lugol’s kills everything . If you see spray nozzles in the produce section, you must detoxify any benzene that may be present with ozone. Rinse your greens and put them in a plastic bag. Insert the air hose from your ozonator. After 20 minutes the benzene is changed to phenol. To get rid of the phenol, soak the greens for five min- utes in a bowl of water with a pinch of baking soda added. The extra vitamin D you need can be made by your own kidneys! The very dental work you are doing helps the kidneys make it. The kidney cleanse (page 596) also helps. Commercial supplies are too polluted to risk. The recipe on page 607 is safe. Dental Aftercare Summary You are hot-packing, hot-swishing, and water picking many times a day. You are flossing a nd brushing your remaining teeth with white iodine or colloidal silver. You are taking Lugol’s, colloidal silver, inositol, betaine HCl, baker’s yeast, and garlic or germanium. You now have the extra calci um, magnesium and vitamin D you need to heal your jaw bone. You will return to take out stitches on time , as your oral surgeon advises. If bleeding a nd pain do not stop by the third day, you will return to your doctor before your stitch-removal appointment day.

The toxins I am referring to I call the “M-Family” and consist of malonic acid (also called malonate ), methyl malonic acid , maleic acid , maleic anhydride , and D-malic acid . Malonic acid is widely used in organic chemical manu- facturing 30 and most dental plastics test positive to it, too, making it a common pollutant. Maleic acid is a component of some bonding agents 31 (meant for bonding the plastic to the tooth). You could be jumping from the frying pan into the fire if you trade your amalgams for plastic that contains malonic acid or any one of the M-family. Malonic acid also occurs in certain foods, see page 121. Malonic and maleic acids, seeping from composites, glass ionomer or porcelain teeth, s oon reach the tumor where me- tabolism is then slowed down, and glutathione is used up in or- der to detoxify them. Glutathione is critical, because without it bacteria and viruses grow unchecked in your cells, making you sick. (The M-Family has many other bad effects, too. See page 117.) Wherever I observed any of the M-Family to be present, glutathione was absent. And wher e all of the M-Family was ab- sent, glutathione was present (provided heavy metals were ab- sent, too). Evidently, glutathione s acrifices itself to detoxify the M-Family. To spare glutathione, your body has other detoxification mechanisms. Using vitamins and minerals, your body detoxifies malonic acid by converting it to me thyl malonate. Then methyl   30 Common malonic acid reactions are described in many college texts including Introduction to Organic Chemistry by Fieser and Fie- ser or Chemistry of Organic Compounds by Carl Noller. 31 Skinner’s Science Of Dental Materials 9 th ed. , Ralph W.

And maleic anhydride to D-malic acid. That is why I call them a “family,” and there are more family members I haven’t re- searched yet. Only dental materials known to be free of the entire M- Family as well as copper, cobalt, vanadium, urethane, 32 and scarlet red dye, are safe in your mouth. Having something in your mouth has the same effect as sucking on it constantly. Things like that should be as safe as food. How would you know which dental materials are free of these? Don’t expect your dentist to understand this problem. You can test electronically for them, like I do (page 457, and Lesson 2 in particular), or use only the materials that I have found to be reliably safe, listed in the previous table. One Step At A Time As stated above, if you have a mouth full of metal or plastic and are ill with cancer, get it a ll removed. Extract teeth with large fillings. Don’t put back anything . You will have holes and gaps in your teeth. But those holes could save your life! It’s hard to believe, but rem oving a dab of plastic or tiny speck of amalgam can mean th e difference between getting well again or sinking.   32 Urethane was researched decades ago and found to be a par- ticularly potent carcinogen. Hundreds of research reports on urethane reside in the biology libraries of our universities. If you wish to re- search this, you could begin with: The Carcinogenic Action and Me- tabolism of Urethane and N-Hydroxyurethane , Sidney S. Mirvish, Advan. Cancer Res., 11, 1-42 (1968)"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"P ART T WO : G ETTING W ELL A GAIN 111 After removing everything, get a new panoramic X-ray. Search the X-ray for tattoos and plastic again using a hand magnifier. Tattoos appear as tiny specks of light. Some specks are merely artifacts from dust on the cartridge. Plastic is hard to identify. Your dentist can tell the difference. These are very important findings. After searching the new X-ra ys, also have your mouth searched by a dentist who uses a magnifier. I have seen that a meticulous visual search for leftover bits of metal or plastic can reveal some that were missed on X-ray and change a deterio- rating trend to recovery. Just one bit! Always keep your final X-rays. Your earlier ones are obso- lete, of course. If your dentist re fuses to give them to you, offer to pay to have a copy made. You might want to take your copy to another dentist to study. Even several dentists could miss something important on your X-rays. This is not the dentists’ fault X-rays are an inadequate tool in many ways. Choose a dentist who uses air abrasion technology for the final cleanup of leftover traces of amalgam and plastic. Don’t refill the holes. Only after you are well and have regained strength and weight should you begin to plan your restorations. If you are extremely ill, and have little time left, but have only a few natural un- touched teeth, extract all your teeth. Don’t bother with X-rays, removing fillings, or finding safe materials. Get general anes- thesia to minimize the trauma. Don’t try to “save” those few good teeth because you risk your life missing just one unsus- pected filling. Dentures are much safer than fillings, and a complete set fits better than partials. (Get fitted for dentures be- fore the extractions.)"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 112 Follow the Dental Aftercare program diligently. You will notice an immediate improvement in appetite and blood build- ing ability. The stress of the surgery is negligible compared to the benefit of removing the toxicity. Unfilled cavities in remaining teeth require you to keep your mouth perfectly sanitary. Sterilize them before going to bed by putting one drop of straight Lugol’s or white iodine on each “open” tooth and then brushing it around. If you are wor- ried about staining, use white iodine although it is only half as strong as Lugol’s. Open teeth tr eated this way are surprisingly resistant to infection. Rubbing baking soda on Lugol’s-stained teeth removes stain. Alternatively, you may brush with colloidal silver (five drops on toothbrush). Don’t chew at an extraction s ite; drink as much of your food as possible (blend it). Rinse your mouth after eating anything . Before going to bed inspect your mouth for bits of food that got lodged. Flush them out with a water pick. If you feel yourself getting better, don’t rush to put back some kind of filling. Wait until you have maximized your im- provements, at least six weeks. Ge t used to how this feels, so you can judge if your new fillings will harm you. Keep notes so you can be objective. Get a new complete blood test so your doctor can assess your overall health improvement. When going to the dentist to get teeth filled, beware of the plastic “strips.” These are just st rips of plastic the dentist places between your teeth to keep th e goop and chemicals off neigh- boring teeth. They also give a sm ooth finish to your filling. But, commercial strips I tested were polluted with cobalt, copper, vanadium and the M-family! Perhaps they were dipped into a chemical solution to make them spot-free. These toxins do wash off. You could use the dentist’ s supply of strips if you took"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"P ART T WO : G ETTING W ELL A GAIN 113 them to the washroom, washed them under the cold faucet and dried them. Don’t neglect this detail. Because there are no safe plastic restorations at present, your cavities are best refilled with a temporary material, zinc oxide and eugenol (ZOE) cement. It is safe to use pure calcium hy- droxide Ca(OH) 2 solu- tion in the raw cavity first. It is painted over the nerve and the open ends of the dentine; it seals the cavity. Don’t be surprised or annoyed if a zinc oxide filling drops out. It wasn’t meant to hold up to great pressure. Just have an- other one put in. At least the hole doesn’t have to be made larger and no anesthetic is n eeded. Your dentist will soon mas- ter the new (in reality, old) skill. If your dentist wishes to use additional substances like phosphoric acid or calcium phosphate, they should be ordered only from chemical supply companies (see Sources ), dental sources are too polluted. But so far, I have not found pollutants in zinc oxide, eugenol, zinc phos phate or methyl methacrylate ordered from dental supply companie s. If there is no way to test the supplies, stick with chemical supply companies. If you have a Syncrometer, there is a way to test your pres- ent plastic teeth to see if they really do contain copper, cobalt, vanadium, the M-family, urethane, bisphenol-A, or scarlet red dye. You simply get emery boards used for filing nails. Then brush your teeth with plain wate r first File one of your teeth, straight across the top and on the side. File hard.

Add a tsp. of filtered tap water. Test for these toxins electronically using pure standards (like Lesson Seven in How To Test Yourself ). Do these tests in triplicate; that is, make three emery board samples of each tooth to be sure you are correct in identifying “bad” t eeth. Don’t be surprised to find all of them bad. Dentists regularly put a dab of plastic here and a dab there, just to “fix them up” as an extra favor to you while other work is being done. The t oxins from all bad plastic are accumulating in your thyroid, liver, spleen, tumor, and bone marrow. You cannot tolerate th ese little “beautifications.” For- tunately, air abrasion with baking soda removes it all in sec- onds. Naturally, you would not deliberately eat malonate- containing food when you are going to a great deal of trouble to clean it out of your teeth. Wh ich foods are good are shown on page 118. Dental Rewards After your mouth is free of metal and toxic plastic, notice whether your sinus condition, ear-ringing, enlarged neck glands, headache, enlarged spleen, bloated condition, knee pain, foot pain, hip pain, dizziness, aching bones and joints improve. Keep a small notebook to write down these improve- ments. It will show you which symptoms came originally from your teeth. Symptoms can come back! So go back to your den- tist, to search for a hidden inf ection under one or more of your teeth, or where your teeth once were ! That infection can be the cause of tinnitus, TMJ (Temporal Mandibular Joint), arthritis, neck pain, loss of balance, and heart attacks! Most importantly, these tooth bacteria easily find their way to your tumor. Pull infected or dead teeth. Do not try to save them."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"P ART T WO : G ETTING W ELL A GAIN 115 Dentures can be beautiful. Of course, methacrylate plastic isn't natural, but it is the best compromise that can be made to restore your mouth. At least it isn't positively charged like metals; it can't set up an electric current nor a magnetic field in your mouth, nor cause tumors to grow. Do not be swayed by arguments that “noble” metals like gold and platinum and silver are OK, that they are “inert” and do not tar- nish or seep. Nothing could be more untrue. Everything tar- nishes and everything seeps. You may be keeping them glossy by the constant polishing action of your toothpaste. But if you look at the underside of metal crowns, the view is frightful. Your mouth is quite corrosive! You wouldn't expect a hand- ful of metal, even noble metal, that was dropped in a well 50 years ago, to be intact. As it corrodes your body absorbs it! In breast cancer, especially, you find that metals from den- talware have dissolved and accumu lated in the breast. They will leave the breast if you clear them out of your mouth (and diet, Which are plastic teeth? Ans. pg. 117 Fig. 37 Beautiful plastic mouth. Fig. 38 Ugly metal in mouth.

Getting well is the magic you can expect from removing unnatural chemicals. To do this for your mouth, get started im- mediately, since your dentist may need more than one day to complete it. Get started the day you read this book! Don't wait until the parasite program is completed. You now have accomplished 5 things: 1. You have killed the intestinal fluke, and all of its stages, and cured the cancer. 2. You have killed all your other parasites, done the Mop Up program, and have yourself on a maintenance program to keep killing them. Your pet has been loaned to a friend. 3. You have gotten rid of all isopropyl alcohol sources. 4. You are attacking the causes of tumors. 5. You have started getting we ll by cleaning up your dental- ware and eliminating bacteria, especially Clostridium . You have also partially eliminated copper, cobalt, vanadium, malonic acid, urethane, and scarlet red dye. You are meas- uring your progress against a list of all your symptoms. One final tip: many dentists are now offering intravenous (IV) treatments. Do not accept them unless you can test the IV injectable and the IV bag for isopropyl alcohol and bacteria. Over half of the injectables and about a tenth of the IV bags I have tested (over 1,000) are polluted! The injectables are bottles of vitamins or ampoules of various health factors. These are injected into the IV bag, whic h contains either salt (saline) or blood sugar (dextrose). Then it is injected into you.

I often find wood alcohol and heavy metals, too. Some injectables have live bacteria in them, most often the albumin and vitamin C. Persons who “get a reaction” to their IV are reacting to Salmonella or E.coli , not some mysterious “allergens.” Of course, the bottles state “Do not use if contents are cloudy”—but should one ever expect bacteria? * 2. Clean Up Your Diet This is the easiest part of your get-well program because YOU are completely in charge. The fundamental rule is: EAT CHEMICAL-FREE AND MALONATE-FREE FOOD. Why Is Malonic Acid Bad? Malonic acid is not natural for humans; nothing in the sci- entific literature indicates that it is a metabolite. It is natural for plants. Certain plants, about 24 families of them, make malonic acid as a step in making their oils! Higher plants pack their seeds with a little oil; some, like the avocado plant, make a lot of oil. But animals only make malonyl Coenzyme A (a relative   * Answer: all of them."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 118 of malonic acid). There is never any free malonic acid in healthy animals. There is a very important reason for never having free ma- lonic acid in our bodies anywhere . Malonic acid is an extremely potent metabolic inhibitor. In whatever organ it is found, your metabolism is slowed down. In fact it almost grinds to a halt. Then this organ can’t use as much oxygen, nor make as much energy (body energy is called ATP ) as it should. Consequently we make fewer amino acids and can ’t make as much protein as we should. This leads to lowered immunity by reducing glu- tathione. The organ is extremely handicapped. There is even a direct effect of malonate on immunity. 33 Although the malonate forming food plants have other fine properties and are otherwise nutritious, the presence of ma- lonate puts them off limits to anyone trying to improve their health. Fortunately, plants without malonates are in the major- ity! Malonate-Free Foods Here is the malonate-free f ood list; stick to it; do not eat foods that are not listed. The fastes t way to recover the health of the tumorous organ, or any othe r organ, is to stop poisoning it with malonic acid. You may notice the difference in a few days. There is an extra benefit for persons who switch to a ma- lonate-free diet. You may notice a higher body temperature af- ter a few weeks, which brings with it a rosier complexion. Overweight persons may experience a slow, steady weight loss!   33 The Effect of Malonate on Salmonella typhimurium Infection in Mice , Berry, L.

Don't eat cold cereal; it has numerous solvents and added chemicals. Even the hot cereals can be polluted with mercury and thallium from the cardboard box. Evidently it was contaminated or sterilized with mercury compounds, and mercury products bring with them thallium pollution. Select a cereal that you have tested or see pictured. Cook it with milk to add nutritive value. Add salt while cooking in order to reach a higher temperature that will kill Rhizobium leguminosarum . Later add vitamin C; not so much that it spoils the flavor. Make granola from a recipe, there are three in this book (page 555). Use honey or confectioner’s sugar. Add raisins that aren't sulfited and cook them with the cereal to kill mold. Don't use nuts; they carry aflatoxins. Use whipping cream or half and half if you need to gain weight . These are very easy to boil and de-malonate with vitamin C. Isn't this a delicious way to start your day! Use ground cinnamon to flavor, or frozen fruit and honey.

Find a friend who has the time to cook for you, if you are not up to it. Or start your day with fried potatoes and an egg and glass of milk. Don't worry about cholesterol while you are recovering. Eat the simplest dairy produc ts you can find, not flavored milk, not whipped butter, not cream cheese, not kefir. Choose milk and butter without coloring added. Always sterilize the milk, first (page 137) and later, after cooling, add vitamin C. Try to find raw certified milk at a health food store. It has a special blood building factor in it, called lactoferrin . Cooking does not destroy it but–and I can’t explain this–pasteurized va- rieties do not contain it. If you could find goat milk, you would also get some of the same rare and valuable factors that are found in shark cartilage. But th ese factors are damaged by heating, so count the ten seconds for boiling carefully. Milk should be 2% or more butterfat because the calcium in milk cannot be absorbed without at least this much fat. Eat home- made yogurt and add honey or homemade preserves yourself. You need 3 cups of a milk product each day. If you don't toler- ate milk, and get diarrhea from it, try a milk digestant tablet to go with it, or cook your milk into your foods. Start with only ¼ cup at a time. Do not choose chocolate milk. Cheese can be used in baked dishes with vitamin C added. Butter can be treated like milk (boiled ten seconds, then add vitamin C).

This book can’t go into a long di scussion of different defini- tions of “natural” and “unnatural.” What counts for a cancer patient is whether the immune system will be called upon to remove something from the f ood you eat. Your immune system is precious. You have (or had) 5000 white blood cells in every little dot of blood. 39 They have the job of keeping you clear of parasites, bacteria, viruses, fungi, and unnatural chemicals. Even if the unnatural chemical s you eat do not do great harm, they must still be removed . White blood cells that are busy re- moving aluminum, nickel, mercury, copper, flavors, fragrance, or even soap are not free to fight bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi. Give your immune system a ch ance to heal your body by removing the burden on it: the burden of countless, frivolous cleaning-up jobs. Clean yourself up so your immune system does not have to.

I found aflatoxins in commercial bread after just four days in my refrigerator, but none in home- made bread stored in a paper bag even after two weeks! Afla- toxin is extremely toxic; it is made by mold. Zearalenone is another very toxic substance found on grains and produced by mold.

And if you are already fa- tigued, this means you might be ev en more fatigued for a short time. You might have headaches from withdrawal, too. But they will only last 10 days. Mark your calendar and count off the days. Headache medicine, like all medicine, is likely to have benzene pollution from the colorant used; avoid it. For energy, to replace caffeine, take one arginine (500 mg) upon rising in the morning and before lunch. Soon you won't need it. Cutting down on coffee, decaf, soda pop and powdered drinks won't do. You must be comp letely off. They contain very toxic solvents due to the processing.

If you do not drink milk because it gives you more mucous, switch to a dif- ferent kind. If you have other reactions, like diarrhea, try milk digestant tablets (available at health food stores). Milk is too valuable to avoid: there are many unwanted chemicals in most brands of milk, but it is solvent-free and very nutritious. The onl y exception should be for serious symptoms, like colitis, bloating, flu, or chronic diarrhea. Do not use powdered milk; it is heavily polluted with solvents. All milk should be sterilized, then cooled and vitamin C-ed. Pasteurization is not sterilization. Milk goes sour after the expi ration date on the carton even when refrigerated and unopene d. Although souring isn't caused by Salmonella or Shigella (other bacteria are responsible), my point is that it is obvious that milk isn't sterile. Boil milk for 10 seconds with a pinch of salt to kill Salmo- nellas and Shigellas. It will also kill the tumor causing bacteria species, Clostridium and Rhizobium . 43 Then refrigerate. But what about the malonic acid in milk? You must do one more thing. Add vitamin C (1/8 tsp. per pint). If your taste buds de- tect this or you are afraid th e milk might curdle, add baking soda first (again 1/8 tsp. per pint).

I have preliminar y evidence that tapeworm stages make malonic acid and killi ng these by boiling does nothing about the malonate already present. Perhaps the vegetable mat- ter of the feed brings it into the milk, too. More research is needed here. If you simply cannot tolerate dairy products, try making cottage cheese (see Recipes ). Separate the curds and whey. Whey is a traditional, delicious beverage with all the calcium of milk in it. There is no substitute for milk; calcium tablets are not satis- factory. Vegetable matter, although high in calcium, does not give you available calcium either. Eating fish can give you a lot of calcium, but it is in the ti ny bones hidden in the fish. Don't try to remove them. Canned salm on has a lot of calcium. On a day that you eat fish, you would not need milk. Goats’ milk is better for you than cows’ milk b ecause it has beneficial factors in it that are similar to shark cartilage and speeds up your abil- ity to make amino acids. It needs to be boiled and vitamin C-ed, too. Dairy products are too important to your recovery to aban- don. But cheese varieties are too difficult to sterilize; avoid un- baked cheese completely. 2. Water : 2 pints. Drink one pint upon rising in the morning, the other pint in the afternoon sometime. The cold water faucet may be bringing you cadmium, copper or lead, but it is safer than purchased water, which usu- ally has solvents in it. Let it run before using it. Filters are rather useless because water pollution comes in surges. A single surge of PCB contaminates your filter.

Nickel is in the soil, where bacteria and fungi belong, too. But if we insist on keep- ing plenty of nickel in our ti ssues, we have only ourselves to blame for our invasion.

The answer, of course, lies in how much benzene we get. Bu t is that all? Since aflatoxin causes isopropyl alcohol build up could another mycotoxin cause benzene buildup? A search of 13 mycotoxins showed that one was 100% correlated with benzene buildup. Zearalenone, a corn mold toxin, is responsible. It is in corn chips, popcorn and brown rice. Persons with benzene buildup have been eating these foods. Stop eating them. Eat white rice. The toxicity of zearalenone is much more important than the nutritional difference. Because benzene accumulates in the thymus and bone marrow, our two most important immune building organs, we would expect a drop in immunity. All persons with AIDS have a benzene buildup. As benzene pollution worsens, many more people must experience immunity loss. Vitamin B 2 specifically helps the body detoxify benzene to phenol.

Buy “c/s”, which means cut and sifted. Lugol's Iodine Solution (see Recipes , page 606) is made of potassium iodide and plain, pure i odine. It is made this way be- cause plain iodine does not disso lve well in water; it dissolves much better in potassium iodide. Potassium iodide dissolves well in water and stays clear; for this reason it is also called “white iodine.” By mixing th e two, we can get stronger con- centrations of iodine than either can provide by itself. Commer- cially available Lugol's was po lluted with isopropyl alcohol and other solvents when I tested them with the Syncrometer. Make it yourself from scratch. Be caref ul not to use bottled water or you will pollute it yourself! DO NOT TAKE LUGOL'S IODINE IF YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO IODINE. IT COULD BE FATAL. How do you know if you are allergic to iodine? You can become allergic from having a large amount of iodine poured into you during a special clinical thyroid or kidney procedure. Your doctor or nurse will already have told you if you became allergic. If in doubt, call your doctor. Iodine has a distinctive trait: it hangs up on anything and everything.

The amount you use is immediately hung up, or attached, to your mucous and can not be quickly absorbed into the blood or other organs. It stays in the stomach. And for this reason it is so usef ul for killing vicious bacteria like Salmonella . Salmonella and Shigella are two stomach and digestive tract bacteria. They can give you terri ble bloating and gas which is often misdiagnosed as lactose intolerance . Younger persons often have a fever when Salmonella attacks. “Summer flu” or “24-hour flu” is really Salmonella getting you. It comes into you with deli food, chicken, dairy food, not to mention picnic food that has stood around for a while. Hands carry these two bacteria, so always wash hands before eating and after shaking someone's hand. People can have chronic Salmonella and Shi- gella infections. Every new strain they eat or drink evidently forms hybrids with the old strain they already had in their stom- achs. This results in much more vicious strains which actually make you feel sick. Shigella , especially, makes you feel angry, irritable, and short-tempered as a mule. Shigella goes to your nervous system. All cases of multiple sclerosis I have seen had rampant Shigella ! Six drops of Lugol's solution can end it all for Salmonella . If you have gas and bloating, pour yourself ½ glass of water. Add 6 drops of Lugol's (not more , not less), stir with wood or plastic, and drink all at once. The action is noticeable in an hour. Take this dose 4 times a day, after meals and at bedtime, for 3 days in a row, then daily at bedtime. This eradicates even a stubborn case of Salmonella . For prevention use one drop in a glass of water at mealtime. Notice how calming 6 drops of Lugol's can be, soothing a manic stage and bringing a peacef ul state where anxiety ruled before."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"P ART T WO : G ETTING W ELL A GAIN 175 Lugol's is perfectly safe (if not allergic) to take day after day, when needed, because of its peculiar attaching property. It arrives in the stomach, reattach es to everything in proximity. Doomed are Salmonella and other local bacteria; doomed also are eggs (cysts) of parasites that might be in the stomach. Naturally, one would not leave such medicine within the reach of children. Also, one woul d not use anything medicinal, including Lugol's, unless there we re a need, like digestive dis- tress. Store it in a perfectly secu re place. In the past, 2/3 of a teaspoon (60 drops) of Lugol's was the standard dose of iodine given to persons with thyroid disease. Six drops is small by comparison, but you need no more. Shigella is not killed by Lugol's af ter it leaves the stomach to reside in the bowel. Amazingly, the two teaspoon dose of Black Walnut Hull Tincture Extra Strength used in the Parasite Killing Program is also effective against many bacteria, including Salmonella , Shi- gella , and Clostridium . If the tincture doesn’t bring to tal relief in 24 hours, search for a source of reinfection. Then eliminate it. Don’t just keep taking the tincture. These bacteria come to us in dairy foods, or perhaps you are self infecting by putting your fingers in your mouth. A traditional, more gradual method of conquering digestive bacteria is with two herbs (w hich are also common spices!): turmeric and fennel . Follow the Bowel Program (page 591). Another traditional treatment for digestive problems is yo- gurt and acidophilus beverages. But modern commercial varie- ties are actually contaminated with Salmonella and Shigella strains.

Clean Up Your Home There is only one job left. Clean up your environment. This is an easy task because it mostly involves throwing things out, so it was left to the last. But don't delay for a minute to get this done. Hopefully your family and friends will jump to your as- sistance. • The refrigerator gets changed. • The basement gets cleaned. • The garage gets cleaned. • Every room in the house gets cleaned. Special Clean-up For Freon Your refrigerator is the most sinister toxin in your home! In the past, various refriger ants were used. Ammonia was especially efficient. And the tin iest leak alerted you by its odor. The mechanics were engineered to be foolproof. But switching to Freon as a refrigerant, which is nearly odorless, brought a new threat: unsuspected leakage. Cancer patients all have especially high levels right in their tumorous organs ! Wheel your refrigerator outside the same day you read this. You may leave it on an extension cord and use it until you find a new non-Freon variety. What is so damaging about Fr eon in your body? After all, it is non-biodegradable. If it has no biological interactions, how could it hurt us? By being non-degradable, however, the liver has no chemical reactions with which to detoxify it so it can"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"P ART T WO : G ETTING W ELL A GAIN 177 leave the body! It builds up, th erefore. Healthy people accu- mulate it in their skin. Sick people accumulate it in their sick organ. I call this phenomenon morbitropism . “Tropism” means there is an attraction. “Morbi” means sick. Toxic things are at- tracted to sick organs. Although everybody in the health profes- sions know this, it is never disc ussed in scientific circles. Perhaps morbitropism has a magne tic or electronic explanation, and will soon be a legitimate subject for study. Freon’s contribution to carcinogenicity has been studied. 52 I find the damaging effect of Freon is that it can act like a trap for other fat soluble items like PCBs, metals, and dyes. Par- ticularly, copper is seen at Fr eon sites. Water that has run through copper pipes carries copper. Your body absorbs the copper which gets trapped by th e Freon already there. Obvi- ously, you must remove Freon from your body. But how? Only one useful reaction with Freon comes to mind. Freon is thought to be responsible fo r the ozone “hole” at the South Pole. Would Freon react with ozone supplied to your body and thereby become biodegradable? Indeed, it does! But only if you drink it as ozonated water. Othe r ozone routes, as intravenous or rectal, have not been observed to be as effective. If you have cancer buy a small ozonator (see Sources ) as suggested earlier. Drop the hose into a glass of cold tap water. Two or three min- utes is enough to be effective. Drink three glasses a day for the first week, then two glasses a day for six more weeks.   52 Mahurin, R.G., Bernstein, R.L., Fluorocarbon-enhanced muta- genesis of polyaromatic hydrocarbons , Environ.-Res. vol. 45, no. 1, 1988, pp. 101-107."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 178 If you are following your progre ss with the Syncrometer, you will see that Freon now appear s in the liver for the first time. Before this, it was marooned in several organs. You may also detect a feeling like indigestion. You must come to the as- sistance of your liver. Even oz onated Freon is extremely bur- densome to the liver. A combination of herbs (Liver Herbs in Recipes , page 599) rescues the liver from its plight , and prevents the indigestion. Drink one to two cups over the course of the day. After drink- ing liver herbs you will see that the Freon now appears in the kidneys. Yet it is marooned ther e unless you assist them. Take the kidney cleanse (page 596) to a ssist the kidneys so they can finally excrete the Freon into the urine. It’s an elaborate detoxifyi ng program of ozonated water, liver herbs, and kidney herbs ta ken together for six to eight weeks. This gets most of the Freon out. Afterward, continue the program at one third dosage for half a year. Forane is one of the new refrig erants. Although toxic, at least I observe it in the liver directly, suggesting that your body is capable of handling it. Remember your new refrigerator will still be using a toxic coolant, and it would be best to keep it out- side or at least vented to the outside. Another source of Freon is the air conditioner in your home or car. You must test a dust sample taken from a flat surface in your car or home (after changing your refrigerator) to find out if it is leaking. Fortunately, the success rate on fixing air condi- tioners is quite good, in contrast to fixing refrigerators.

When house drafts pull it into the air you will inhale th em. They cut their way through your lungs and organs like millions of tiny knives, spreading through your body, since there is no way out for them. You smell nothing and feel nothing. This makes it a very sinister poison. Your body, though, recognizes these sharp, pointed bits and tries to stop their spread by sequestering them in cysts. Most solid malignant tumors contain fiberglass or asbestos, another glass-like particle. In nearly all cases a hole can be found in the ceiling or walls, leading to fiberglass insulated parts of the house. When these holes are sealed in an air-tight manner the house air no longer is positive for fiberglass. Cov- ering with paneling is not sufficient. Check your dwelling for uncovered fiberglass. Repair i mmediately. Search for small screw holes intended for pictures, or electric outlet plates that are missing. Also remove fiberglass jackets from your water heater and fiberglass filters from your furnace and air conditioner. Replace with foam or carbon. Best of all, hire a crew to remove it all from your home, and replace insulation with blown-in shredded paper or other innocuous substance. Never build a new house using fiberglass for any purpose. Clean Basement To clean your basement, remove all paint, varnish, thinners, brush cleaners, and related supplies. Remove all cleaners such as carpet cleaner, leather cleaner, rust remover.

Seal cracks in the basement and around pipes where they come through the wall with black plastic roofing cement. In a few days it will be hard enough to caulk with a prettier color. Spread a sheet of plastic over the sewer or sump pump. Clean Garage Do you have a garage that is a separate building from your home? This is the best arrangement. You can move all the basement chemicals into this garage. Things that will freeze, such as latex paint, you may as well discard. But if your garage is attached, you have a problem. Never, never use your door between the garage and house . Walk around the outside. Don't allow this door to be used. Tack a sheet of plastic over it to slow down the rate of fume en trance into the house. Your house acts like a chimney for the gara ge. Your house is taller and warmer than the garage so garage-air is pulled in and up as the warm air in the house rises. See the drawing. In medieval days, the barn for the animals was attached to the house. We think such an arrangement with its penetrating odors is unsavory. But what of the gasoline and motor fumes we are getting now due to parked vehicles? These are toxic besides! This is even more be- nighted.

Store them in the garage, not the basement. Since all vapor rises, they would come back up if you put them in a downstairs garage or basement. Next clean the kitchen. Take all cans and bottles of chemi- cals out from under the sink or in a closet. Remove them to the garage. Keep only the borax, white distilled vinegar and bottles of concentrated borax and 50% vinegar you have made. You may also use homemade soap. Use these for all purposes. For exact amounts to use for dishwasher, dishes, windows, dusting, see Recipes . Remove all cans, bottles, roach and ant killer, mothballs, and chemicals that kill insects or mice. These should not be used anywhere in your house. They should be thrown out. Remember to check the crawl space, attic and closets for hidden poisons also. To wax the floor, get the wax from the ga- rage and put it back there. A cancer patient should not be in the house while house cleaning or floor waxing is being done.

Do not drink water that sits in glazed crock ware (the glaze seeps toxic elements like cadmium) like some water dispensers have. Do not buy water from your health food store or any other dispensing place. All holding tanks, all stills, all pumps, must be periodically cleaned, sterilized and greased. Petroleum derived products are used for this. These pollute the water. You can identify them with a Syncrometer. It would be interesting to find out who is servic- ing your health food store’s supply and with what. Change all the galvanized or copper water pipes to PVC plastic. All cancer patients have a buildup of copper. If you are already anemic, this is your top priority. Copper prevents iron from being used by the body to make hemoglobin. Copper uses up your glutathione. Copper causes mutations. It would be wise to switch to plastic plumbing before anybody in your home develops illnesses. Although PVC is a toxic substance, amazingly, the water is free of PVC in three weeks! If you have a water softener, by-pass it immediately and re- place the metal pipe on the user side of the softener tank. Sof- tener salts are polluted with st rontium and chromate; they are also full of aluminum. The salts corrode the pipes so the pipes begin to seep cadmium into the water. After changing your pipes to plastic, there will be so little iron and hardness left, you may not need a softener. If the water comes from a well, con- sider changing the well-pipe to PVC to get rid of iron. While the well is open, have the pump checked for PCBs. Call the Health Department to arrange the testing.

Filters were only meant to remove the amount of metal in city water. Corrosion overburdens it. A new filter may work well for only the first 5 days! Filters even add to the water pollution unless they are made of only carbon. Reverse osmosis water usually contains ytterbium and thulium! The cleanest heat is electric.

The three weeks is counted from the time you finished all the clean-ups. Most patients are too intimidated by their doctors to speak up for themselves. Always take a family member or friend with you to give you cour age.

Since the infective stage in nature is the metacercarial 54 stage, are we eating metacercaria from vegetation like lettuce? I have not seen evidence for this but it must be researched, thoroughly, as a possibility. You will see in the case histor ies how some people test YES (positive) for parasites in spite of having completed the parasite killing program and being on the maintenance program. This is possible because a reinfection can occur in as little as one hour! Of course, your own bowel is th e most likely source of reinfec- tion. Keep hands sanitary by rins ing with grain alcohol solution. And never, never put fingers in your mouth. Observe the best sanitation rules. Zap daily and stay on the maintenance parasite program and Mop Up. In cases of persistent reinfection the pa- tient either had family members who were infected (although symptom-free), or they had repeat edly indulged in fast foods or delicatessen meats. Parasites can make good progress in two days (eating you up and reproduc ing in you) if given the chance. Unfortunately for fast food lovers, the solution is not to make a daily routine out of the maintenance program. Herbs powerful enough to kill parasites probably are not advisable on a daily basis.

But could the eggs, miracidia and redia that we eat also survive and develop in us? The miracidia and cercaria with their tails could simply swim away into our bodies.

See the photos of paras ite stages in urine. This is certainly evidence for sexual transmission. Two overlapped miracidia.

However the size difference makes them easy to distinguish. Blood Could Be A Source The blood carries the infective stages of the intestinal fluke. Until the public blood supply can be searched for them 56 , it is not safe. If you need surgery, use your own blood or get it from someone who has gone through the parasite-killing program. Of course, without isopropyl alcohol in your body, such an infec- tion could not give you cancer but it is still very undesirable. Mother's Milk Could Be A Source If your body is teeming with ve ry tiny fluke stages because of the solvent in your tissues, could they be transmitted through mother's milk? See the photograph of mother's milk. It shows a fluke egg almost ready to hatc h. The mother was full of ben- zene. The baby was full of benzene from drinking the mother's milk. The family was using cooking oil polluted with benzene.   56 Antibodies to the various fluke stages or antigen tests could be used to test the public blood supply for parasite stages.

Fluke stages are plentiful in the saliva. Never kiss your pet. Feed your pets home made food as our grandparents did. Keep all your pets on the Pet Parasite Program. To summarize: 1. We are eating the infective stages of the intestinal fluke in beef, chicken, turkey and dairy products. 2. We then transmit it to each other by kissing on the mouth and sex. 3. Even if we pick it up in th ese two ways, we would not get cancer from it unless we have isopropyl alcohol in our bod- ies. Biological Questions My tests show me the close association between parasites, solvents and carcinogens. And that mycotoxins and bacteria are also crucially involved in cancer. But many questions remain. Since there is never a case of cancer without adult human intestinal flukes being present in the liver, 57 do the adults make ortho-phospho-tyrosine, namely cause cancer? Obviously not, because in many of us it is in its normal “home”, the intestine, and we do not have cancer. Only when it is in the liver do I find ortho-phospho-tyrosine in the body, but usually in a tissue   57 In a few case histories they were not observed."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 202 far away from the liver. It is found where the baby stages and carcinogens (copper, fungus, etc.) ar e. Do the stages make the ortho-phospho-tyrosine? Why must there be isopropyl al cohol in the liver and can- cerous tissue for cancer to develop? Is isopropyl alcohol part of the chemistry of ortho-phospho-tyrosine formation? Are the eggs and cercaria attracting the isopropyl alcohol or is the iso- propyl alcohol damaged tissue attracting the parasite stages? Or is isopropyl alcohol simply force-hatching the eggs or metacer- caria? We have found a bacterium, Clostridium , to be present in every tumor. And, indeed, a bact erial theory has been worked on in the past. Dr. Livingstone-W heeler believed the bacterium to be Progenitor cryptocides . A book has been published about her findings. 58 Could there be a virus that is really doing all this instead of the fluke? Again, if the virus be longed to a fluke-bacterium or to the fluke itself, it would be plausible. The virus theory has quite an impressive amount of research behind it. Why do some people have isopropyl alcohol in their livers, intestine and white blood cells after using shampoo or shaving chemicals while others do not? Evidently, many people can detoxify it quickly so it doesn't build up. Is this a liver problem, caused by the fluke, or a toxin such as aflatoxin B? I never see isopropyl alcohol without aflat oxin B being present. Or do other known carcinogens act by inhibiting isopropyl alcohol detoxification? If aflatoxin B is the culprit, why does it accumulate in some of us but not others, since we a ll get plenty of it in our diet? I have evidence indicating vitamin C protects against aflatoxin B.   58 The Conquest of Cancer by Virginia Livingston-Wheeler, MD and E.G. Addeo, Franklin Watts 1984."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"P ART T WO : G ETTING W ELL A GAIN 203 There are documented cases of large doses of vitamin C being effective against cancer. Because I always see Aspergillus fungus growing in the cancerous tissues, is aflatoxin being produced right then and there? Or are we merely eating too much aflatoxin? I also see Penicillium fungus with its mycotoxin, patulin. What is the role played by human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG)? It is always found in the liver, at the same location where the isopropyl alcohol is found, but only after isopropyl alcohol builds up there. And I see hCG before ortho-phospho- tyrosine is made. hCG quickly spreads itself throughout the body (notice how often it is f ound “everywhere” in the case histories). Does hCG tag the tissue that will become cancerous and begin to make ortho-phospho-tyrosine? Is it being made by a mutant gene? What is the role played by othe r growth factors? What about tumor necrosis factor? Why don’t cancer patients have this like others do? Are they eating more patulin? Why does only Fasciolopsis cause cancer when many other flukes are also multiplying? Production of ortho-phospho- tyrosine can be stimulated by NMDA receptor activation. 59 Perhaps the intestinal fluke alone possesses a virus, a bacterium, or an antigen epitope that fits in the NMDA receptors. Fortunately, these questions don't have to be answered be- fore you cure yourself of cancer.   59 Hilmar Bading and Michael E.

Only the processed foods are, and not even all of them. If we eat natural food, we will be safe. (And if we eat malonic-free natural food we will be healthy!) • I have never seen a case of mercury toxicity from eating fish. It is always amalgam tooth fillings. • PCB pollution is not in everyt hing (but they are prevalent in detergents). • I have never seen a case of lead, arsenic or pesticide tox- icity from eating fruit or vegetables. Pesticides used on foods haven't penetrated them, as far as my tests show. Simply cut away the blossom and stem end, and wash thoroughly. But don’t eat food sp rayed to keep it fresh ! Such food must be peeled or ozonated, not just washed. • Municipal water is still the safest source. I found no cases of lead, asbestos, aluminum, or any solvent toxicity due to city water, and only a few cas es of arsenic or PCBs. Evi- dently, the immune system can keep up with this small concentration even with constant use. • Solvents, PCBs, aflatoxins, and 4,5 benzopyrene leave the body in a few days after you stop getting them into your body, not a few years! Only Freon and copper persist— for weeks. • Lead is not coming from paint; it is mainly coming from lead solder joints on copper water pipes. • Asbestos is not coming from municipal water or building materials; it is mostly coming from your own clothes dryer belts (imported varieties) and hair blowers."},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"P ART T WO : G ETTING W ELL A GAIN 205 • Although milk (or buttermilk) is a much maligned bever- age, it is still unpolluted with metals, solvents, or afla- toxins. But it should be bottled in plastic containers to avoid dioxane contamination, and have no dye added. Boil it briefly to rid it of bacteria and parasite stages and have vitamin C added to rid it of malonate. This would protect all the butter and cheeses made from it later. • Benzene and other solvents are not coming from wide- spread gasoline pollution. Instead, benzene is coming from our foods and products, due to the mistaken belief that we can use petroleum products in the manufacturing of food. This is an easier problem to correct."},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":" 207 Part Three: Case Histories The case histories you are about to read are NOT picked out of the files because they got cured, leaving other cases behind who did not get cured. These 138 cases are ALL the cancer cases that walked or were help ed into the office over a sixteen month period. Although not all of them were diagnosed as having cancer by their clinical doctor, I consider ed them to have cancer if they tested YES (positive) for ortho-phospho-tyrosine (the abnormal growth stimulant). See The Tests for more information on can- cer markers. Similarly I considered them “cured” when they tested NO (negative) to ortho-phospho-tyrosine, even though other symptoms did not immediately abate. The names have been changed to ones of the same sex picked at random from a telephone directory. Ages have been changed by up to five years. Some personal characteristics have been changed in non-essential ways. All of them got cured if they carried out the instructions. 35 did not carry out instructions or could not be followed or had special circumstances that prevented them from carrying out the instructions. This leaves 103 who did get cured. As you will read, the method is 100% effec tive in stopping cancer regard- less of the type of cancer or how terminal it may be.

HCG is tested occasionally as a pre-cancer indicator.

Remarkably, HIV/AIDS is caused (and cured) very similarly to cancer and is the subject of another book by this author. Parasites About 120 varieties, including intermediate stages. Toxic elements About 70 varieties. Solvents 27 varieties. Pathogens (bacteria and viruses) About 80 varieties. Kidney stones Seven varieties.

We have the capability of tes ting each of the above 300 sub- stances in any of the body's 100 tissues for which I have sam- ples.

At the age of 24 she had hepatitis. It took her several months to get over it. Then, after a few years, she had a partial hysterectomy for numerous cysts in the ovary and uterus. She has one ovary left. She started having a heavy feeling in her chest and getting tired. Her doctor put her on Premarin TM and Provera TM for energy. She took that for 1½ years. She got some energy out of it. Recently, her doctor took a chest X-ray and found a tumor in the thymus gland. They did a biopsy of the tumor which came back negative to cancer. They did surgery, to remove the tumor, and found it was indeed cancerous with many other “fingers” all over the chest and a couple of spots on the right lower lung. Part of the diaphragm was cut during this surgery; a ne rve to the vocal cord was also injured. The thymus gland was removed, but “fingers of thymus” were not. She also had 36 radiation treatments over a 7-week time period. Then everything showed up OK until about two months ago when she had tightness of chest again.

Suddenly it was too late. She had to have a hysterectomy. They were crushed. And they were perplexed when the cancer wasn't gone after the surgery. But they carried out the instructions and took on new living habits and became completely free of it. Maybe they'll live “happily ever after” now with that important lesson behind them. 4 Pamela Charles Breast Cancer Pamela Charles is a middle aged woman who had just been dis- charged from the hospital.

In spite of her severe st omach problems, she managed to get down the black walnut tincture and wormwood (in the parasite killing recipe). She didn't take any cloves. But she was lucky and all intestinal fluke stages were gone one week later. This cleared up the colitis and many other pains, too, so in 2 more weeks she was nearly free of the whole list she came with.

Summary: This was a health conscious family. They were intensely interested in how their PCB pollution had come about. They all prom- ised to rid themselves of parasites and stick to some new health rules. Since they were from 2 states away, they did not plan to return unless Mark's health shows signs of deterioration. We have not heard from them for eight months. 8 Nevita Thompson Hodgkin's Disease Nevita Thompson is a middle-aged school teacher, very vivacious, lives on handfuls of vitamins, all carefully organized. She spends a lot each month on supplements and is ha ppy with it. She has had Hodgkin's for several years and also has extr emely high triglycerides. We saw her April, 1992.

Four months later : Acetone (Solvent) YES Probable cause of neuropathy, along with bacteria —is planning to see dentist) Summary: Nevita had Hodgkin's disease for about 4 years when she came to us. She saw her medical doctor regularly throughout that time. But after ridding herself of the intestinal fluke this spring, her doctor noted that, for the first time, he saw no evidence of Hodgkin's anymore. Her spring visit was not a regular visit, nor were her later ones. She only came in to restock her vitamin supply. That is why her visits were so short. At her first visit, I told her about the pro- panol/cancer connection and she took herself off cosmetics. So when the solvent test was done later on, no isopropyl alcohol was found in her. 9 Paula Erickson Breast Cancer Paula Erickson is a healthy looking person, age 58, with metasta- sized breast cancer to lymph nodes. The lymph node was found in August, 1987. Mammogram suggested that it was non-malignant. She has had three mammograms - all non-malignant. Biopsy done in Jan. 1988 showed it was malignant. First breast was removed. Then she took chemotherapy for six months. Later that year a doctor put her on Tamoxifen TM ; it worked for a while, then it went “haywire.” Then she was put on Megace. TM On Oct. 1989 she was started on radiation in right neck and shoulder area. That did not seem to “do anything.” She went to Mayo Clinic and they did nothing more; said she was on the right course. Then she went to Ellis Fischel Clinic in Columbia, Missouri, they found a blood clot; they used heparin in hospital (plus chemo) for eight days. She has had eight rounds of chemo. End of July 1990, second breast was removed. Finished chemo Nov. 1991. Then she was put on Halotestin TM . Her right arm is very swollen and tight. She has put on 10 pounds of water in the last month. Soreness in left shoulder since the surgery. She is not on any morphine yet. She has a cold and is on antibiotic Erythromycin TM .

Summary: Paula was very willing to make all the changes neces- sary to recover. At her last visit, she was planning to go home and live by herself again. She thought this might get her away from the arsenic which must be coming from her son's home (she was staying with her son during this illness). But the son had taken her to her medical doctor for a last follow up before a happy leave-taking. The doctor, seeing her improvement, felt she could tolerate more radiation and chemo. This was a sincere effort on the doctor's part to prolong her life. She never got out of the hospital. No more details were given.

Although I referred to it plainly, her responses were on a different subject as though she didn't hear me. Her friend (who was extremely concerned about her) played this pretend game with her, probably to get her compliance. Fortunately, she did comply with all instructions, and she regained her health in a short time. 11 Ruth Stang Colon Cancer Ruth Stang is a young woman in her 20's with lots of pain in neck, right arm, shoulder, chest, ovary.

She appreciated the encouragement we could give her that she would be completely well in a few months. A few days later the bank had returned her payment check, saying a"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 226 “stop-payment” order was given on it. She did not keep her follow-up appointment, and we have heard nothing since. A particularly sad case! Probably her family or friends were angry, in a well-intentioned way, that she was “wasting” her money on alternative therapies. Six months later Ruth returned with a friend. She explained her absence and paid her old bill. She has had no more dizziness or passing out since she was last seen. Her whole family has stopped eating beef. She says she feels well and did not need to come back. She was bringing in a friend with cancer; that is why she re turned. She wanted to be tested for cancer again, herself.  Ortho-phospho-tyrosine (Cancer) NO  hCG (Pre-Cancer) NO  Protein 24 (HIV) NO Marilyn Werdick Pancreati c Cancer and HIV Illness Marilyn Werdick came with a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer at age 50. It happened suddenly, with stomach trouble two months ago. She thought it was due to her pain medicine for lower back pain. CAT scan showed area of pancreas that was suspicious.

She will be off all commercial beverages and cosmetics and benzene sources. Four days later She missed her appointment. Twelve days later She died (telephone call). Summary: Marilyn had none of the risk factors associated with HIV. She was just an ordinary middle-age woman who didn't drink al- coholic beverages. If she had acted quickly, she would most certainly have survived and gotten reasonably well again. Perhaps she missed her appointment because of embarrassment over not being able to stop smoking. Maybe I was too hard on her about it. We did not hear any details surrounding her death. Notice the adult fluke in the thymus where T-cells are made. The thymus is a small gland and the fluke is a large parasite; it is like having an elephant in the kitchen. How could the thymus do its work? People often feel strange sensations at the top of their breast bone when flukes are in it, but she didn't. Cancer and HIV illness are first cousin diseases . Cancer results when propanol builds up in the body. HIV devel ops when benzene builds up. 12 Jean Barish Cancer At Uterus and Kidneys Jean Barish is a 31 year old woman.

Summary: Jean did not come into our office because of cancer. She was very shocked but not frightened away, fortunatel y. She dug right into her tasks. Her finances probably won't allow her to return. So I hope she abides by the meat-avoidance rule and the cosmetics and beverage avoidance rules. Notice that her colitis disappeared as well as the cancer and parasites. She felt very well at the third visit. Four months later I was wrong. Happily, Jean came back and brought her husband, too.

Note that only the pancreatic fluke was multip lying in her, although she must be picking up the others at the sa me time - from rare meat. Only the pancreatic fluke survived and is multiplying - because of the solvents in the pancreas! 13 Sally Corson Ovarian Cancer This 70 year old woman had a partial hysterectomy 35 years ago, with the remainder removed 5 years ago. She also reported that she has some urinary tract infection for which she is taking Macrodantin TM at bedtime. Her main problem is ovarian cancer which started about 5 years ago.

Fasciolopsis was present in adult form at all these locations. Her chemo seems to be killing the stages which otherwise would be present.

Eliminate commercial cosmetics. Summary: This woman's cancer history goes back ten years. She had conventional treatment at this time. But it came back recently; her doctor used the cancer marker Ca 125 to monitor it. My test showed it present in the colon, now. There was a Fasciolopsis in the liver and a stage in the liver and blood. There was propanol in her white blood cells. Hopefully, she has eliminated the propanol and cleared up her new cancer. She has not followed up. Her first visit was too brief to do more testing. 14 Mary Emerson Cervical Cancer Mary Emerson is a 39 year old woman who described her main problem as follows: In about 1986 a Pap smear showed inflammation of the cervix.

Take magnesium oxide (300 mg) one/day. Three weeks later  Parasites (ALL) NO  Kidney Stones (ALL) NO Note: She did not need our kidney stone recipe to dissolve away her phosphate crystals. A change in diet was sufficient. Summary: This woman did not come in for health problems but only because she was worried about cancer, since her husband had died of it. Indeed, her intuition was right, but very quickly she removed all of the cancer, even though she substituted quassia for our regular parasite recipe. Even her kidney stones disappeared with a simple change in diet. She has probably not re turned for financial reasons (she lives on Social Security). Her good attitude will probably bring her back quickly if she has a health problem.

His blood test sug- gested parasites (high platelet count) and Fasciolopsis was found. Then the cancer test was done and, indeed, he had a cancer started in the lungs. He was a heavy smoker but couldn't quit. But he very promptly cleared himself of parasites. He also had dog heartworm which can cause coughing. He acted quickly to clear up his Staph aureus infection by having a wisdom tooth pulled. This began to help his tinnitus. Later we noticed a common lung infection, Pneumocystis, but he still could not stop smoking.

This explains why the parasite stayed in the intestine and did not move to his liver or lungs. This bout with lung cancer was missed by his medical doctor whom he continues to see regularly. Perhaps if his medical doctor had also seen the cancer, he would have quit smoking. Maybe not! Four months later Andrew is still smoking.  Protein 24 (HIV) NO  hCG, Ortho-phospho-tyrosine (Cancer) NO He is very relieved.

He is getting 10 units irradiated platelets every 4th day, 3 units of packed RBC's every 12-14 days. He has a strep infection in the blood. He has been on heavy antibiotics for several months.

She and the children would take a vacation with a friend."},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 240 Summary: This was a particularly tragic case. His young children sat quietly in their chairs during the appointment, sensing the grave danger their father was in. But he made jokes about my technical com- petence and devices instead of listening. A friend who had gone through our cancer program successfully tried to encourage him at home. He could have saved himself even at the last visit. He had such great hopes for the bone transplant. He was al ways talking about his exceptional oncologist and the great rapport and team work in the hospital. It was as if he couldn't see that he was dying, although his preschool children saw it clearly. His wife would have gladly moved from their fossil fuel contaminated home or turned the furnace off and put in an electric space heater till they could sell the home. But she had no influence over him. 17 Margaret Barnes Multiple Myeloma Upon arrival at the office, the husband explained that due to her pain, we should discuss as much as possible with her seated in the car. So I began with a conversation with her husband in the office instead of with her. The chronology of her illness was: 6 months ago she had arthritis; 3 months ago it became more serious; 1½ months ago wa lking was very painful; 1¼ months ago she needed a walker; 4 weeks ago she could not walk. Her clinical doctor diagnosed rh eumatoid arthritis and treated her with a steroid. Her pain did not alleviate. On January 2, 1992, she was rediagnosed and confirmed with an MRI as having multiple myeloma. On January 6, 1992, she had surgery. They put steel reinforcement in one leg and cut out the cancerous part in the other leg. Radiation was begun one week ago. She will have another week of this but her doctor let him know they could only expect a short remission, if any. They are thinking of going to a doctor in Philadelphia who does megadose chemo IV. I discussed my approach with her husband, reassuring him that I did not controvert any clinical treatment. I persuaded him to bring her in briefly to verify existence of parasites. She was using a walker and had visible pain, but she was interested in my approach. : Fasciolopsis (Parasite) YES at liver and colon I did not search further.

I made the mistake of thinking he would certainly return in a few days for his appointment and we would get him started on his parasite program then. It was not to be. I can't help wondering who made the choice: his wife, his children, or himself? I often do see a family member making the choice for the sick person. Often it's the sick person's fault for not stating his or her wishes; they are afraid of in- conveniencing the family and being a burden and costing money. He was an alert, intelligent man at age 67; he still had a lot to live for. 22 Joyce Stegeman Breast Cancer, Colon Cancer, HIV Joyce has been going to a clinical doctor for 2 months, but no di- agnosis has been reached.

Small wonder that her symptoms were too confus ing for clinical doctors to reach a diagnosis. By the time I saw her I was routinely testing everybody for Protein 24 in their white blood cells (immune system); P24 is a small chip off the core of the virus. When the intestinal fluke was gone, both cancer and HIV were gone! She had the solvent benzene accumulated in her; propanol was not tested at the first visit so it can't be ruled out of the picture. Joyce got her health back. Her illness had made her fi- nancially broke, so she did not come back. She was only in her early 30's. We hope she is staying off benzene and propanol sources. Edna Kennedy Breast Cancer, Lung Cancer Edna Kennedy is a vivacious, middle-aged woman with a slightly stocky frame, age 59.

Five months ago the cancer recurred in the lung. It was treated to completion, showing no presence of cancer. But now it has broken out again and is present in her lung, liver, and brain, as well as other sites. Her history of previous surgeries are: breast lump - benign, hysterectomy - parotid tumor, benign. She is currently on four drugs. She has been on the Birth Control Pill in the past.

She appears healthy. She is on Halcion TM for sleep and has been on it for three years. He r whole family has a lot of sleep problems. She has extreme sweats during the night; she gets wet all over with feeling hot. She agreed to show er off her sweat each time to get rid of the toxins in sweat. She is on morphine for pain. Her dosage is 30 mg taken at 9 am, 2 PM, and 9 PM daily. She has pain from her right upper abdomen across the front to the left side. It is more like soreness, when moving. She was on Percocet TM for pain before morphine until it failed. She is on Hytrin TM for high blood pressure and has been on it for eight years. It keeps her blood pressure at 140-150/70-80. She is on stool softener each night. Many years ago she went to the doctor to say that she had pain to the right of her gallbladder. They never found anything. In the early 70's, she had malignant melanoma on her forehead. The doctor froze it and it has not returned. In the 70's she had a bowel obstruction and needed surgery. About three years ago the bowels bled a little. Her doctor found a tumor. They proceeded with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The tumor was biopsied and labeled “oat germ,” a ve ry rare tumor.

His gallbladder was taken out 10 years ago. He had a stroke one year after that. He used to smoke, but he quit two years after his stroke. He has paralysis since his stroke. Prostate was trimmed when he had prostate cancer six years ago. Radiation treatments were given at that time.

Two months later He has skipped all earlier appointments. He has been on mainte- nance parasite program and done everything correctly.

Holmium and PCB are often found together. 25 Phylis Petrie Lung Cancer This is a pleasant woman, age 56, who was first seen by us two years ago. Her reasons for coming were: 1) Arthritis everywhere (arms, elbows, shoulders, wrist, hands, legs, knees, feet) even her ears hurt; 2) gas in stomach; 3) high blood pressure for which she was on Tenormin TM , 4) appetite down; she lost about 15 pounds in the last 6 months."},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"P ART T HREE : C ASE H ISTORIES 263 She was on Voltaren TM , codeine, Tylenol TM , Niferex TM . She smokes, and her son has came to live with her. He is a builder. By early 1990, she had cleared a lot of her problems. She was gaining some weight. We encouraged her to get dental work done and stop smoking. (Needs metal out of mouth.) She did not come back for six months and is still smoking. Toxic element test showed PVC and cesium in her immune system. They were doing some remodeling. We also found bismuth, antimony, vanadium. She was using Vick's Vaporub TM . They searched for a gas leak (vanadium source) and found it. She resented being told to stop smoking. Her son was intimidated by her; he bought cigarettes for her since she wasn't strong enough to shop herself. We begged her to stop after our ortho-phospho-tyrosine (cance r) test was YES (positive). We did not see her again until four months after that. She had seen a clinical doctor who “tested her for cancer and gave her a clean bill of health.” Still smoking. : Ortho-phospho-tyrosine (Cancer) YES : Radon, Asbestos (Toxic Element) YES They will stop home remodeling and seal cracks but don't wish to do anything else since they feel I am wrong about the cancer. Three months later Doctor found mass in lung at a routine checkup and diagnosed it as Large Cell Carcinoma. She stopped smoking and wants to get well.

But she was so strong a per- sonality that she just “snapped th eir heads off if they even brought up the subject.” Even when she was bedridden and coughing without stopping, the children still brought he r cigarettes. The asbestos proba- bly came from the clothes dryer. She rallied after she stopped using it. They had vented it into the house to save heat! We detected the cancer originally with the hCG marker, not ortho-phospho-tyrosine; at that time I was still searching for the best cancer marker, one that wouldn't miss a single case of early malignancy. I have no doubt that Phylis would have recovered if she had continued on the parasite program while she was away with relatives. Without a maintenance program it is too easy to become reinfected. 26 Norman Jones Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer was diagnosed one month ago.

He did not return after hearing this happy news, hoping that the dental problem and plumbing and radon problem s would go away by themselves. However, he continued to have pain which was interpreted by his clinical doctors as ongoing cancer and was given anti-male hormone. This made his wife angry; she insisted on the dental work and radon work. After this, the genital pain went away: we learned this from one of the children.

Cynthia is allergic to cats, and doesn't have one. : E. hist, Trichinella (Parasites) YES at the eye : Ancylostoma, Human liver fluke (Parasite) YES at part of eye only The human liver fluke is not the same as Fasciolopsis , the human INTESTINAL fluke, which starts a cancer when it moves its “home” from the intestine to the liver. : Fasciolopsis (Parasite) YES at retina and same part of eye Very unusual. : Oxalate (Kidney Stones) YES She will stop drinking tea and start vitamin B6 and magnesium oxide 300 mg/day. They are suspicious of herbs, so won't start on kidney herb recipe. : Cadmium (Toxic Element) YES at kidneys Corroded water pipes. Summary: The parents left abruptly at this point. I could not per- suade them to start on anything. She was scheduled to have half her face, including part of the jaw, remo ved by surgery in a few weeks. Yet a harmless herbal treatment did not tempt them to try it. I'm sure they loved their daughter as much as life its elf. Yet, my methods seemed to arouse anger instead of joy at finding a fresh approach to a hopeless situation. They took no supplies and di d not return. I believe this must be a case where Fasciolopsis stages crossed the placenta into the un- born child. The mother may have had high levels of a solvent causing them to disperse from the mother's intestine. I must also wonder whether this solvent was fed to the baby through the mother's milk so that the fluke stages would quickly multiply in the baby.

Summary: This strong, tall man came in for a minor problem - just needing to nap in the middle of the day. But his intuition told him there was something wrong about that. The pr ostate cancer shocked him, but he attacked the problem immediately. In 2 weeks the cancer was gone, but his fatigue spells weren't. We have not seen him since his last visit; hopefully his wife will smell the gas in time to prevent a tragedy in their home. 32 Anne Brill Breast Cancer Anne Brill is a physically active 61 year old woman with few health complaints. She is a former home economics teacher who has traveled extensively and is now retired. She has pain in her lower back, knees, and feet; a rash on her face periodically ; and considers herself to have a weight problem.

The pain under the armpit is typical of a cancer development in the breast. Since she was back to playing golf again and free of pain, she did not follow-up to be sure the PCBs were gone. 33 Claudia Stein Breast Cancer Claudia Stein is a 27 year old woman with exposure to contaminated well water.

Summary: This young mother of 4 was concerned when her baby did not nurse well, thinking that the contaminated well water experience might still be having bad effects. She was not very shocked, though, to hear she had cancer because her sisters had it. She was delighted that the baby was feeding well again afte r 2 weeks. Their limited finances prevented her from coming back to solve the PVC problem. I should have gotten a milk sample to see if Fasciolopsis stages are in her milk. This question has been on my mind for some time, since it is a body fluid where parasite stages could be transmitted. 34 Marlene Broad Hodgkin's Disease Marlene Broad, a 32 year old woman, began having shoulder pain about 2 years ago. It was treated as bursitis, but the pain became worse. She lived with it. A few months ago, a varicose vein was noted on her right arm, as well as swelling on the right side of her neck.

Of course, this is unnecessary now. Three days later  Fasciolopsis (Parasite) NO : Fasciolopsis cercaria (Parasite) YES  Fasciolopsis (other stages) NO She needs one more quadrant of dental work. Summary: This young woman started out with a handicap at the location of the kidney that was inherited, plus surgery at the kidney. The remaining kidney was clogged with mercury and palladium from her tooth fillings; this gave her 3 kinds of kidney stones. In addition, she smoked. But 7 days later the cancer was gone. She had reduced smoking, removed the metal fillings and a root canal, removed the kid- ney stones with herbs, and killed th e parasites in her liver. Parasite stages hung on, but she will have thos e eradicated soon. She seemed committed to improving her life styl e and beat-out the scheduled X-ray and chemo. We have not seen her since, but we have no reason to think she was unsuccessful. Notice that th e pain and swelling in her shoulder and arm was gone the day after the dental work was done. 35 Lisa Lindley Colon Cancer Lisa Lindley is an 82 year old woman whose main problem is: she spends 20 hours a day in bed because she is so fatigued. Two years ago, she had colon cancer surgery (14 feet of her colon was removed). She had 17 radiation treatments. She also has high blood pressure. : Ortho-phospho-tyrosine (Cancer) YES at colon : Fasciolopsis (Parasite) YES at liver and colon : Fasciolopsis redia (Parasite) YES at colon and blood, other stages NO She was started on parasite program. However, we were out of wormwood capsules, so we substitu ted Quassia herb. She was to drink 1/8 cup of a strong tea of Quassia 4 times/day.

Drink milk instead of soda pop. Summary: This was such a friendly, pleasant woman it would have been a tragedy to lose her to massive genital cancer. She saved herself from this dreadful fate in 6 days. She knew intuitively she was drinking too much pop and was rather glad to be told to be off pop and caffeine both. She may have had the liver fluke from the start since I had not done the complete parasite test. Her visits had to be very brief since they were shared by other family members. 37 Peter Smith Cancer At Colon This is a 41 year old man with psoriasis for over 10 years. It began behind his calf.

I am surprised at her calmness. : Isopropyl Alcohol (Solvent) YES high Eliminate propanol polluted products like cold cereal and shampoo. : Benzene (Solvent) YES high Off benzene list.  PCB (Toxic Element) NO Summary: She arrived with HIV test results that were NEGATIVE. Apparently, however, she had the intu ition that something was quite wrong with her but could not get it established clinically. We recom- mended a vegetarian diet for her, which appealed to her anyway. She has not returned, and three months have passed. Hopefully, she has followed some of the advice we gave her. Her finances may not have been adequate for her to return for follow-up. 38 Earl Grad Prostate Cancer Earl Grad, age 72, came in for pr ostate cancer. His clinical doctor had found a high PSA (prostate cancer marker). He also found a small nodule on the left side of Earl's prostate. Earl has diabetes and high blood pressure. He is on Lopid TM to lower triglyceride; a diuretic, Hytrin TM , to lower his blood pressure and Lanoxin TM to strengthen his heart. He will start on parasite program. Si nce he could barely sit because of pain, I only took 5 minutes to get him started and let him leave the office. I had to assume the ortho-phospho-tyrosine and Fasciolopsis tests would be YES. Twenty days later His blood test with his clinical doctor showed PSA is very high (45).

Fortunately, he chose to work on his health instead of settling for a handful of prescription drugs. 1 encouraged him to follow up his PSA test with his clinical doctor so his clinical doctor wouldn't worry about him. He should tell his clinical doctor what he is doing. He still needs to clear his diabetes. He is strong and healthy again, able to work. 39 Lynn Mercer Cancer Of The Uterus and Colon Lynn came into the office for menstruation problems; she was ex- periencing excessive bleeding.

Summary: Edward took many risks and one could say that he had poor compliance, but due to his wife's persistence, he returned many times, making a little progress each time. After his pains were gone and his clinical doctor said he was free of skin cancer, he lost interest in improving his health. Hopefully, his wife is keeping a watch over his shampoo and shaving products to avoid propanol. She can do nothing about his eating habits in restaurants. Edward is one of the rare cases where the fluke adult is already present in the liver, and yet there is no cancer marker, ortho-phospho-tyro sine, being produced. Perhaps an additional stage, besides eggs, is necessary, since reproduction is the parasites' objective.

Summary: Deanna got rid of the problems she came in for and her cancer, too, in 3 visits, but she is choosing the unwise path. The bacte- ria under her metal teeth will continue to infect her body and let others grow as well. Hopefully, she will ge t the metal out soon. Notice how the breast was next in line for the cancer and how the breast had been accumulating arsenic and nickel. Toxic substances from the top of the body are collected by lymph nodes and passed into the breast for stor- age when there is too much fo r the kidneys to eliminate. Sherry Wu Cervical Cancer Sherry had a hysterectomy for endometrial cancer in 1965. A year ago her PAP test came back with suspicious results. She had pain from her left hip down her left leg.

Summary: Sherry is a very active person; it would break her heart to be forced to stop her gymnastics class. This is what drove her 2000 miles to see us for a mere pain in the leg. But it turned out to be cancer. Since she is an old client who had seen us over the years for any major problem, I do not doubt she carried out our instructions precisely. She has probably saved herself surgery, and without any interruption of her gymnastics class. 48 Maria Perez Skin Cancer This 44 year old woman reported that her main problems are: 1) A lesion on her right lower leg which appeared about a year ago. It has been surgically removed but has retu rned. It tested negative to cancer, but it isn't healing.

Summary: Maria got rid of her cancer in 16 days when the intesti- nal fluke was gone. But she still had other flukes that were multiplying in her, due to a variety of solvents accumulated in her body. Hopefully she will try to eliminate them. 49 Gladys Jackson Cervical and Breast Cancer Gladys is a young, vivacious person, only 39, complaining of chronic fatigue.

She did well, considering that she was bar ely able to believe she had cancer after her negative mammogram. Perhaps the diet improvement made her feel so much better that she didn't think the dental work was needed at this time. Perhaps her husband could not accept the need for plumbing improvement.

She has had them removed from back of neck, ears, chin, breast and even fingers. (My guess is these are PCB caused.) 2) Swelling at joints all over body. 3) Pain everywhere: elbows, shoulders, wrists, hands, chest, lower back, legs, knees, feet, and headaches. This suggests gallstones and rheumatoid arthr itis but the chest pain doesn't fit into this picture. I will test for HIV (She is using Advil TM as a pain killer. It doesn't help much.) 4) Stomach problem. She had a hysterectomy for excessive bleeding in her early 20's and her ovaries were removed 5 years ago. A total mastectomy was done 8 years ago for multiple cysts and she got breast implants but had to have them removed for leakage later. I discussed with her the need to do all 5 of our routines and that she would probably be much better in 3 months. These would be: 1) Kidney cleanse; 2) Parasite killing; 3) Toxic element removal; 4) Bacteria and virus elimination; and 5) Liver cleanse. Since her urinalysis showed crystals in the urine, we would start with a kidney cleanse. : Ortho-phospho-tyrosine (Cancer) YES at colon, liver, and stomach I explained to Debra that this unexpected result would change the order of our program; we would kill parasites first.

I could see she was very angry and would not come back to see me. I emphasized the primary importance of staying on a parasite killing maintenance program. I did not manage to warn her of the solvents benzene and isopropyl alcohol, or of the danger of eating undercooked beef; chicken and turkey. Summary: It is understandable when a sick person finds our meth- ods and results too strange to believe. Hopefully, as illness worsens, she will get tested and find her way back he re. Note: In HIV cases, the adult fluke has developed from a cercaria in the THYMUS, not in the LIVER. 51 Leona Taylor Cancer Of Cervix Leona was referred to us by a rec overed cancer client. Her clinical doctor has been following the cysts in her breast for 7 years. One got to be the size of an egg; it was drained. Two years ago she had a bad PAP. 1½ years ago a lesion was found in the breast. She has done nothing. She now aches over the ovary regions. She has lower back pain. She has had double periods all this year. She is so fatigued that she has to lie down after 3 hours of work. She aches all over the chest area.

She is to see dentist immediately to have metal tooth fillings replaced. She had a urinalysis test with her. It showed crystals of various kinds in the urine. She is to start on kidney herb recipe. Continue parasite program. Summary: I wonder if I did the right thing in telling her the cancer was already gone at her second visit. She did not return and possibly has done nothing about her mercury problem. Mercury may be the cause of the strange symptoms. At age 47, she should be trying to undo the bad health practices of her youth, not sweeping them aside. Perhaps she will surprise us and one day walk in, in radiant health. 52 Robert Ohr Prostate Cancer This is a sturdy, confident looking man, age 55. He is here for prostate problems.

Nickel is quite so luble in fat, so skin oils could dissolve a lot of it out of the glasses frames and absorb it. Notice that Robert has made a lot of changes already in his lifestyle and yet his pains remain. But he has two potent causes of prostate trouble still left to conquer: asbestos and nickel. The list of metals absorbed into his body was exceptionally long - probabl y due to many kidney stones blocking their excretion. Although the kidney stone test was not done, I am curious to see how his pains ar e after several weeks of stone re- moval. Usually we cleanse kidneys early on to give clients pain relief. Our preoccupation with toxic elements slowed down the whole pro- gram. But he is free of cancer and soon will be free of pain. One month later (4 months and 2 weeks after the first visit) He has no pain with sitting but pain in front lower abdomen persists as well as in testicles. (This is probably the bladder.) I suspect a missed parasite, even though he has been on maintenance parasite program. : Hymenolepis dim (Parasite) YES A small tapeworm! : Schistosoma haem (Parasite) YES at bladder Could this be causing his abdomin al pain? He will take 20 worm- woods for a few days in a row and note if pain stops. This is in ad- dition to high dose black walnut tincture and cloves. This often comes from a pet. Must ask if he owns one.

Note that propanol was not listed as YES and yet ortho-phospho-tyrosine is present. Nor is Fas- ciolopsis listed as present in the liver. Were these tests missed? If not, this would be a unique case of cancer without both of its two chief causes. I will search for more such exceptions. 53 Rojer Costa Brain Cancer This is a young (age 29), sturdy man with one leg amputated, sitting in a wheel chair. He has had several operations for cancer, it runs in his family. His brother has brought him from his home in the northwest. His leg was amputated for osteogeni csarcoma two decades ago. He received 19 months of chemo. Earlier, he had a brain tumor, astrocytoma. It was removed by surgery. Three years ago, he got radiation for a subsequent brain tumor. He also had surgery and chemotherapy at the time. As a result of his last surgery, he has mild seizures in his left hand and left arm. He is on Dilantin 400 TM in 2 doses plus Valium TM for muscle re- laxant as necessary. He also has left side weakness in his hand, arm, and leg.

Summary: Rojer was from 2000 m iles away and had only one week to spend with us, yet he accomplished his purpose. This was a most fascinating case: another parasite of the fluke family, the Human liver fluke, has joined the intestinal and other liver flukes to invade tissues like bone and brain. This is no doubt due to the presence of solvent in these tissues. Perhaps his whole family was in the habit of using a lot of rubbing alcohol. Both the cancer and the propanol were eliminated in a week's time. But will he pursue the dental problem? Jan Whitacker Cervical and Uterine Cancer Jan, age 41, came with friends who had an appointment in the hope that I could work her into the schedule for a very short visit. She had cancer of the cervix and uterus twelve years ago. They both were removed by a complete hysterectomy. She got no radiation or chemo.

There are other explanations but not enough evidence. Note that the test showed fluke stages at the cervix and uterus when these had been removed! I suppose this means there is a remnant of such tissue still present. 54 Kathryn Poore Breast Cancer Kathryn Poore (age 56) came to th e office because of long-standing problems with shingles that were spr eading into the right eye.

Since bone cancer is seldom the primary cancer, they searched for the primary source and found it in the lung. She was treated with chemotherapy and radiation to her lung and back.

She only has 10 now. She has a constant migraine for which she is on 3 medications, including codeine. Nothing else helps. She also has total insomnia without her medications. Her entire colon has been removed surgically for colitis; there is no rectum or anus. Her clinical doctor said it was all precancerous. She also has a histor y of stomach ulcers and numerous smaller health problems. But her eyes light up at the mention of cats, as if they had nothing to do with her condition. She has extreme allergies - to almost everything; I would susp ect Sheep liver flukes as well as Strongyloides.  Protein 24 (HIV) NO : Ortho-phospho-tyrosine (Cancer) YES at intestine This comes as a surprise to her.

If not, she is to make all her own beverages from fruits and vegetables. She can drink 2% or more milk, if tolerated, and single-herb teas. She will be off cold cereals. She will start on parasite program for herself and cats. Summary: Susan came to the office for migraines, never suspecting that this could be due to a tiny parasite, threadworm, that cats could bring her. Her chances of recovering from migraines are zero, but maybe she can reduce them a lot by treating her pets daily with a parasite program designed for them. Indeed, she did have the Sheep liver fluke; this causes terrible obstruction in the liver bile ducts; how can the liver detoxify food chemic als with such a severe handicap? Be- sides this, some intestinal flukes are nesting there. We don't often see them together in the liver. Together, these two flukes are probably keeping the pancreatic fluke out of th e liver, relegating it to bladder and kidney, besides pancreas. These were the only parasites tested; she scored three out of three. And in quite untraditional organs for these parasites. One look at the solvent test gives the clue. Wood alcohol ac- cumulates in the pancreas and induces hatching of flukes there. Pro- panol induces hatching in the liver. The other solvents may have their favorite target organs, too, causing parasitism there. This has not been studied yet. Happily, she was eager to correct her problems. Eight days later Susan came back for a follow-up.  Ortho-phospho-tyrosine (Cancer) NO  Solvents (ALL) NO She feels quite different (better). The Toxic Element tests showed asbestos very high, antimony YES, arsenic very high, and PCB YES. Others were not tested since this is enough for her to cope with. She doesn't use a hair blower so the asbestos must be coming from the clothes dryer. She will persuade her husband to change the belt to a USA made belt. The antimony may be in her hand cream, she will switch to our skin softener and apricot kernel oil. She will go off detergents to get rid of PCB. But the arsenic is a real problem because she needs to treat th e house and cats with pesticide frequently.

She is enjoying her new lifestyle and wants to make changes. Four weeks later (5 weeks after first visit) She is still complaining about memo ry lapses. Her husband insisted on a CAT scan and other clinical tests which she has done; nothing showed up. She has periods of completely irrational behavior. This suggests intermittent interference w ith brain function. I will search for tapeworm heads (scolices). : Moniezia (Parasite) YES She will kill this extremely harmful tapeworm stage with an herbal product called Rascal (which we us ed before we developed the Mop Up program). After 3 weeks she will be on the usual maintenance program of twice a week treatment, including Rascal. This tapeworm head may be emerging due to solvent exposure in the past. : Hexane, Methyl Butyl Ketone, Styrene (Solvents) YES She will stay off processed food. Carol Masters Intestinal Cancer Carol was accompanying another client of ours and after seeing what our diagnostic system could do, she wanted to be tested for cancer before leaving.

He will avoid rare meat. Summary: What a blessing it is for some of us to have a sister or brother, so truly interested in our welfare that idiosyncrasies are overlooked. Perhaps she will help him recover if she can't persuade him to come back. Notice that the two big flukes were thriving in his body, but the pancreatic fluke which he must be picking up frequently, too, had not gotten established. This is probably due to the absence of wood alcohol in his body. Wood alcohol accumulates in the pancreas allowing the pancreatic flu ke to multiply there."},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 338 57 Greg Byrem Colon Cancer Greg Byrem was seen by us 1½ years ago for gout.

The most serious were: psoriasis in 4 locations, thyroid dis- ease, migraine headaches, irritable bowel syndrome, stomach trouble with lactose intolerance, and a severe upper and lower back pain which keeps her from sleeping at night. She had a long list of medicines to take. She is drinking water that has come from the refrigerator. Because of severe allergies she eats a lot of tofu cheese. I explained to her that in order to get well, she would need to: 1) Cleanse her kidneys for 3 weeks; 2) Kill all her parasites; 3) Elimin ate toxic elements from her body; and 4) Cleanse her liver. All this could ta ke several months so she should be patient. At least it wouldn't be expensive.  Protein 24 (HIV) NO"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"P ART T HREE : C ASE H ISTORIES 349 : Ortho-phospho-tyrosine (Cancer) YES This positive cancer result was so shocking to her that I did not search for a location, but simply reassured her that she could com- pletely cure it quite quickly. : Fasciolopsis miracidia (Parasite) YES There were no adults in the liver!

Could the Sheep liver fluke also induce a cancer by starting ortho-phospho-tyrosine formation? It is an in- triguing question. It is 6 weeks already, and she has not returned. We wonder what happened. Three months later Judy has appeared. We are happy to see her. She stated she did not believe a thing we told her at her earlier visit. But she was too afraid not to take our herbs and follow the rules about products. Suddenly she began to feel amazingly well and wondered if it was all in her head. Although she was done with the recipe she was too afraid to stop. She was also afraid to continue and this indecision brought her back.  Protein 24(HIV) NO  Ortho-phospho-tyrosine, hCG (Cancer) NO : TCEthylene (Solvent) YES"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 350 : Mercury, Silver (Toxic Elements) YES Others not tested.

We were not at all sure she was complying with instructions after the first visit. But her intelligence (and perhaps a little fear) saw her safely through this ordeal. Juanita Holden Colon Cancer, Metastasized Ms. Holden is only 57 but her clinical doctor has given her 2 months to live and doesn't mind if she goes to see alternative therapists. She had surgery for colon cancer five years a go, and now it is in her liver. She has been getting chemo once a month, but it is getting worse. Her doctor is using the CEA test as a cancer marker.

She will eat no meat that isn't cooked in the oven until the meat falls off the bone. And order only fish and seafood in restaurants. Summary: Six weeks have passed, and we haven't seen Ms. Holden for follow-up. She had the deadly benzene solvent in her, and it was difficult for her to believe it was in her toothpaste. But she had a chance to save herself and recover. Did she take it? Alan Anderson Multiple Cancer Sites Alan has a son who is an oncologist and recommended a PSA test for him a few years ago. This is a ma rker for prostate cancer. It was over 100! It should be less than 4. Doctors found cancer metastases into lymph nodes and bone. Chemo brought his PSA down to one. Recently it began to rise again. He was switched from Lupron TM (antitestosterone drug) to Cytradin TM plus cortisone to repl ace his own.

He seemed to have enough determination for us to let him start his second program, the kidney herbs, on his own without visiting the office in between. This is not generally good policy since it tends to become overwhelming. But he begged for progress with his pai n when sitting and lives two states away, too far away for frequent visits.

So she t ook herself off recently but the problems are getting worse. The Tamoxifen TM was given to her to block estrogen uptake after she had a mastectomy on the right side. She had breast cancer in 1986. She now has severe migraines, insomnia and sees her moles are growing. She has had a hysterectomy. They have a water softener.  Protein 24 (HIV) NO : Ortho-phospho-tyrosine (Cancer) YES at liver and breast Cancer spread to the liver. : Fasciolopsis (Parasite) YES at liver and colon : Fasciolopsis eggs (Parasite) YES at liver, colon and blood : Isopropyl Alcohol (Solvent) YES at liver and breast She has a pet (no doubt the source of Strongyloides, causing her migraines).

Summary: What a toxic build-up there is in Lynette's body! She is dissolving her tooth fillings but inst ead of passing the metals through the kidney and bowel they are staying stuck in her breast. She probably has numerous kidney stones from all this which, in turn, then slow down excretion. She is full of solvents ; no doubt her detoxifying mechanisms are so overtaxed that no solvent can be oxidized any more. The aluminum silicate is probably coming from the water softener. She has not returned Perhaps her husband did not like to hear all this. We hope he will come along if she comes back. 64 Sarah Hor Kidney and Colon Cancer Sarah is 47 years old, and came for her kidney disease. She was given interleukin 1 and interleukin 2 plus Interferon shots for her mul- tiple kidney tumors. That was 9 mont hs ago. She was scanned recently, and the tumors are growing again. She has only one kidney left. The other kidney was removed, full of tumors, 2 years ago, and at the same time half of her thyroid was removed for renal cell carcinoma. She listed ringing in her ears and stomach problems as her other problems. She has had a complete hysterectomy and wears an estrogen patch.

Summary: Sarah did not return after hearing her cancer was gone. This is probably for financial reasons. She was very pleased with how she felt and could not believe these simple herbs succeeded where in- terleukin and interferon had failed Hopefully, she is staying on our meat rule (beef turkey, and chicken must be cooked at home, as well done as if it were pork, never grilled And only fish or seafood in restaurants). The thioctic acid will speed up removal of gallium from her body. 65 Bryan Myers Colon Cancer Bryan, age 57, came for his painful feet, which began after an aortic bypass was done in 1990. At first the leg from which the blood vessel was taken was painful, too. His clinical doctor told him there was no connection. He smokes. My first thoughts were thallium or cadmium toxicity.  Protein 24 (HIV) NO"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"P ART T HREE : C ASE H ISTORIES 357 : Ortho-phospho-tyrosine (Cancer) YES at intestine This was a surprise.

This could be from eating raw meat or by sex or kissing. Smoking probably drew it to his lung. Another possibility is that his intestinal flukes were somehow killed while the stages surviv ed in the blood. He will start on parasite program. He will use ginseng capsules and Chinese herbs to help him stop smoking. His wife w ill smoke outdoors only.

They may contain cadmium, adding to cadmium from cigarettes. Cadmium is the usual cause of leg pain (smoker's leg).

He had a blood test done and will bring a copy next time."},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 358 Summary: Although Bryan's cancer cleared up within 16 days without stopping smoking, we emphasize stopping a lot. His lung le- sions will probably continue to enla rge, and he may not get his foot pain relieved without stopping. We may not s ee him again, though, since heavy emphasis on stopping addic tions loses us nearly every cli- ent. 66 Leo Stafford Liver and Intestinal Cancer This young man in his early thirties came to the office for a skin rash in the groin area. Although it is no doubt Candida, I suspect PCBs are weakening his immunity. He has tried every medication given by clinical doctors, as well as over-the-counter products. Nothing works. Also, any little sore he gets from his work (he works with lumber) does not heal for a long time. I suggested stopping using detergents, where PCBs are found, and using simple borax for all purposes: dish washing, laundry, shampoo, bathing, and citric acid to rinse his hair and body (¼ tsp. to a pint of water). : Aluminum Silicate (Toxic Element) YES In salt, switch to Hain's. : Bromine (Toxic Element) YES Rare, could it be in lumber treatment?

My generation did not have this handi- cap. Body yeast in the genital area must be a difficult problem. If all the people with this problem were to join hands, could they persuade authorities to protect them? Could th e responsibility be placed on the suppliers to analyze their products for a list of harmful substances (like PCBs or solvents) rather than havi ng the responsibility be with the in- dividual person to prove that the ailment was caused by a particular product? We shall soon all be in this young man's situation! Notice that in the first solvent test there was no benzene, and in the second test it was YES. He had picked it up between tests. He was still healthy enough to detoxify and clear it from his body. But he is very near to getting the HIV virus from the fluke in his thymus. Five weeks later He feels better and has more energy. Skin purple spots (reddish, but not open lesions) are still on both legs . He has had 2 bouts of the flu. Groin itch is better. He has not yet done dental work. 67 Sue Weeks Cancer at Multiple Sites This 52 year old woman gave a ha ir-raising account of brushes with death. In the early 80s, she was diagnosed as having Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Her clinical doctors found she had 80% blockage of carotid arteries and leg arteries. She chose ch elation instead of standard clinical treatment but stopped after 60 treatments without responding. She was on 90 supplements a day but was still bedridden. She picked"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"P ART T HREE : C ASE H ISTORIES 361 up active mononucleosis and went down to 84 pounds in weight. She got all amalgams out but it made no difference. She tried acupuncture for pain. She was in pain all over and had terrible fatigue. She tried the macrobiotic diet for 2 years; this made her feel better, but she didn't gain weight or energy. She went to an Oklahoma clinic and a Reno clinic for homeopathy. No improvement. Near death, she went to an alternative hospital in Mexico. She was on Gerson therapy for 2 years but couldn't get well. Suddenly she improved without explanation for 3 months. Then she worsened and was hospitalized. Her relationship broke, and she had to return to her mother's home. At the same time she was pursuing clinical routes with CAT scans, hematologists, neurologists, and other specialists too numerous to mention. Her mother died of cancer. : Ortho-phospho-tyrosine (Cancer) YES at liver, kidney, bladder, intestine, stomach Cancer everywhere!

Summary: A ten year torment was e nded in 2 weeks by killing this large parasite that had invaded so much of her body; it is a wonder she was alive to tell the story. Possibly all her alternative therapies helped her to survive, each in its own way. She was undoubtedly reinfecting herself many times and letting parasites proliferate due to having the two worst solvents accumulated in her. Her intelligence and courage saw her through. Hopefully she w ill follow-up in the near future. Esther Santos Breast Cancer This 49 year old woman came to the office for a list of peculiar symptoms: numbness of lips, arms a nd tip of tongue occasionally. Tin- gling sensation in her back. Leg veins turn blue and painful, also the wrist veins. Her clinical doctor dia gnosed pulmonary angina and put her on 2 aspirins a day for the last 4 months. The symptoms haven't changed. She had a polyp in a milk duct in he r right breast removed a year ago and another one in the left cheek sinus, not removed. She recently discovered a lump in her breast and is scheduled for a biopsy in 10 days. They have a water softener.

Summary: Esther only made this one visit to our office. She feared her insurance company would not pay for anything. Perhaps the breast lump biopsy showed a malignancy, and she pursued the clinical route of removing the breast. Perhaps it did not show a malignancy (the parasite program could have turned it around in 5 days), and she lost confidence in our testing. Whatever happened, we will never know. Hopefully she began to avoid propanol containing cosmetics as we suggested. 68 Rosa Lee Kestler Pancreatic Cancer Rosa Lee, age 63, came in becau se her clinical doctor found gall- stones in her gallbladder. She had a serious attack where she passed out and was hospitalized. They did a blood test then, which showed that the pancreas had some blockage, too, b ecause the pancreatic enzyme, lipase, was very high in the blood. The doctor wanted to do surgery to investigate the problem and possibly remove stones from the pancreas, too. But she declined the offer and doesn't know what to do next. She brought in a recent blood test when all this happened. BLOOD TEST Result Comment 1. FBS slightly high (135) clean the liver 2. BUN and Creatinine slightly high clean the kidneys 3.

She reeked strongly of tobacco smoke. When I brought this up to her, she replied that since she was dying there was no need to quit. The women with her disagreed and tried to support my view. Then I pointed out to her that she was one of the fortunate ones who have only 2 problems of any difficulty: She merely needed her teeth replaced by plastic and to seal cracks in her basement. Checking in her mouth, ther e were only 4 on each side that needed replacement, but she began to sob about the cost. She whined and groaned about having to borrow money from her family, and said she couldn't do it. I personally believe she was looking for any excuse to die rather than survive, so that she would not have to quit smoking. What devilish games our addictions pl ay with us. And to think that wonderful, moral-minded people allow themselves to grow tobacco for money, knowing that the addiction spells death for other humans, per- haps their own grandchildren! I hope her wonderful family will per- suade her to choose life for herself and transport her to the dentist. 71 Betty Naylor Cervical Cancer and HIV Betty is 24 years old, arriving from a neighboring state for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. However, she had an impressive list of additional symptoms involving her lower back, stomach, chest (tightness and the need for long breaths of air), throat, skin, ears, neck, and PMS. They have a water softener. The chest pr oblem suggested the possibility of HIV-illness. She sleeps all day and has burning over the chest. She has been sick all winter. : Protein 24 (HIV) YES at thymus, vagina There are no known risk factors. : Ortho-phospho-tyrosine (Cancer) YES at cervix only : hCG (Pre-Cancer) YES at thymus, cervix, NO at vagina This was quite a surprise.

Summary: This young woman fairly bounced out of the office at the good news of her second visit. The entire story of how she could have gotten the HIV virus and developed cancer of the cervix was like a revelation to her - almo st unbelievable. Yet her mother, she said, was witness to her health improvement in just 5 days, and so she is forced to believe it. At any rate, she is much too scared not to believe that she had HIV virus. Notice a peculiarity: There is no adult intestinal fluke in the liver. Not even a stage of it is in the liver ! Yet there is ortho-phospho-tyrosine being produced. It is being produced at the cervix where the miracidia and cercaria are and where the Sheep liver fluke eggs are. Now, the Sheep liver fluke adults are found in the liver. Could they orchestrate the production of ortho-phospho-tyrosine for the intestinal fluke? Or was there an adult intestinal fluke at some earlier time which died? One very seldom sees both adult flukes together. Do they kill each other somehow? Notice, too, that the cancer marker, hCG, was present along with the cancer marker, ortho-phospho-tyrosine, at the cervix. But only hCG was being produced at the thymus. Is a particular parasite stage responsible for producing hCG? I explained to Betty that she must take great care to protect her thymus for two years so that it will completely regain its health. It would be tempting to neglect the dental work but this would be a tragic mistake. Benzene leaves the thymus in a weakened condition so that other solvents and toxic substances continue to get accumulate there. This would, surely, give her lowered immunity, perhaps even AIDS."},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"P ART T HREE : C ASE H ISTORIES 371 72 Ken Kitsinger Brain Cancer Ken is a quiet but highly attentive young man of 19. He said his parents had brought him to our office for depression but he disagreed with this opinion. Both parents were respectfully quiet while he spoke. He is currently getting psychiatric counseling. I explained the cause of serious depression to be brain parasites and toxic elements accumulated in the brain. It was therefore quite shocking to see the initial test results.  Protein 24 (HIV) NO : Ortho-phospho-tyrosine (Cancer) YES at brain He has brain cancer! : hCG (Pre-Cancer) YES at brain, blood : Fasciolopsis (Parasite) YES at liver, intestine; NO at brain : Fasciolopsis redia, cercaria, eggs, miracidia (Parasites) YES at brain Note: Every stage of the fluke is present, suggesting a high level of solvents. Note that the cancer marker hCG is present in the blood; it could have been found clinically by a blood test. Finding this brain cancer was rather shocking. But his mother stated that Ken's first cousin, a boy, had died of brain cancer at the age of 18. So the news of Ken's brain cancer was not totally unbelievable. I could assure them of a complete recovery. : Sheep liver fluke redia (Parasite) YES at brain Here the presence of a developmen tal stage of Sheep liver fluke without an adult present to produce it, suggests another source, most likely raw meats.

Summary: brain cancer is fairly rare; yet two persons, both very young, had this disease in his family. Could it all be inherited through the placenta from the mother or through sex during pregnancy? Had his body defended him all these 19 years, only now to be losing the battle? Surely, he had not been using propanol all this time, nor benzene. My guess is that the fluke resided quietly in the intestine for all family members. Then, as usage of propanol and benzene began in early adulthood, they colonized the brai n and thymus. This still does not answer why the brain was selected by the parasite stages, rather than another tissue. Possibly, the brain- seeking solvents, xylene and toluene, were present, the cousins choosi ng the same brands of beverages. Seventeen days after first visit The dentist took panoramic X-rays and found no mercury fillings. He will get a tooth extracted, though.

But she was not strong enough to clean up the solvent benzene, which was polluting the air in her house and let 2 weeks slip by.

Summary: Both cancer markers ortho-phospho-tyrosine and hCG were present in the white blood cells and prostate. It is tempting to speculate that propanol can cause the Sheep liver fluke, as well as the intestinal fluke, to produce ortho-phospho-tyrosine. This would mean the Sheep liver fluke could give us cancer, too. But if they don't let each other into the liver, whoever gets ther e first may stay there. Or perhaps the intestinal fluke can chase the Sheep liver fluke out of the liver. Could it be that sheep flukes can defend against invasion by intestinal fluke? The relationship between them should be a fascinating study. Five weeks later  Ortho-phospho-tyrosine, hCG (Cancer) NO  Isopropyl Alcohol (Solvent) NO He is rid of his cancer.

Our kidney herb recipe should be able to clear up his prostate problem, I assured him. He uses a water softener.  Protein 24 (HIV) NO : Ortho-phospho-tyrosine (Cancer) YES at intestine and prostate This news dismayed him, wondering why his clinical doctor had not caught it when he was so frequently checked.

I suspect these metals are nearly all coming from his tooth fillings, including the lead. We will see if it is gone after doing dental work. Notice he had very high levels of metals in his white cells. He has not begun washing out his prostate with the kidney herbs yet.

So he was given extra heavy doses of chemot herapy and radiation. However, 5 weeks after ending the treatments, this very large lump appeared on his chest. He has a lot of pain on the right side and is on pain killers continually. His fingers and elbow on his right side are numb. He has no other problems. He appears well, except for cringing with pain throughout the appointment (despite the pain killers).  Protein 24 (HIV) NO : Ortho-phospho-tyrosine (Cancer) YES at intestine, side of breast and breast Note: I believe this is the only breast cancer in a man that I have seen. : hCG (Pre-Cancer) YES high at all organs! His body electrical resistance is exceptionally high, possibly due to PCBs.

He will go off cold cereals and body products with propanol in them. He will switch to our shampoo and shaving products. : PCB (Toxic Element) YES high He will go off detergents and use borax for all purposes. He will start parasite killing program. Summary: Wes did not return, for reasons unknown. Hopefully, he carried out our instructions. Note his high level of PCBs. They reduced the body current from 55 microamps to about 40 microamps when 5 volts is applied across the hands. Per haps they block or obliterate the conductance channels in our cells. Perhaps they raise capacitance. This would be interesting to study."},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 390 80 Richard Nunley Intestinal Cancer Richard, age 49, came for his tinn itus in both ears.

He will need to clean up his mouth of chronic infection and cleanse his liver of bacteria. 81 Iris Kilpatrick Bone Cancer Iris was diagnosed with bone cancer a week ago, involving hip, shoulder, and knee. It was first found as a tumor on the kidney. It began with bleeding from the bowel.

Her cancer is gone but I hope she finishes this health program. 82 Nancy Hampson Cancer Of The Pancreas and Intestine Nancy came with her brother for her general poor health. She had learned from a friend how to do a liver cleanse and has already gotten out a lot of stones.  Protein 24 (HIV) NO : Ortho-phospho-tyrosine (Cancer) YES at intestine and pancreas Cancer of the pancreas and intes tine came as quite a shock to her. She is only 36 years old and has never drunk alcohol. In fact, she has a strange sugar problem; when she eats sugar she gets panic attacks and weird symptoms like partial blindness, dizziness, mood change. (I suspect numerous parasites in the pancreas.) Yet, if she does not eat she gets very shaky and nervous. : hCG (Pre-Cancer) YES at many body tissues  Fasciolopsis adults (Parasite) NO : Fasciolopsis eggs (Parasite) YES high at pancreas With such numerous eggs, she must have had an adult to release them; perhaps the adult was killed. : Sheep liver fluke cercaria (Parasite) YES at pancreas : Sheep liver fluke metacercaria (Parasite) YES"},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"P ART T HREE : C ASE H ISTORIES 393 : Pancreatic fluke adults, stages (Parasite) YES at liver and pancreas  Human liver fluke (Parasite) NO I suspect she is full of wood alcohol which targets the pancreas.

Sodium fluoride is a well known metabolic poison, in fact it was widely used in my graduate lessons in understanding metabolism. It inhibits the anaerobic part of general animal me- tabolisms. Traces of fluoride in orga nic form are beneficial, and the body may convert some of the inorganic type, but it is inadvisable to expose yourself to the amounts of inorganic fluoride found in toothpaste, even though it is present as a “non-toxic” compound such as stannous fluoride. 61 Fluoride in toothpaste greatly over- shadows the fluoride consumed in city water, because I do not see toxicity after stopping toothpaste even when still drinking city water. : Strontium (Toxic Element) YES Off toothpaste. : Zirconium (Toxic Element) YES Off toothpaste and deodorant. : Thulium (Toxic Element) YES Off multi-vitamins. She will get her metal tooth fillings replaced with metal-free plastic. Summary: All these metals, as well as the solvents, were accumu- lated in her pancreas. There is a possi bility that the chromate will also disappear after she stops the supplem ents. So we will wait until this is done before searching harder for its source. 83 Lenore Dale Intestinal Cancer and HIV This is a 34 year old person who works for a clinical doctor and has already tried a number of alternative health procedures. She has a long list of bizarre symptoms, such as swollen and itching lips, gagging when eating (suggesting AIDS), and chest heaviness (making it even more probable). : Protein 24 (HIV) YES at thymus, vagina and ovaries   61 The Merck Index (10th Ed.) st ates the solubility of stannous fluoride is about 30%.

This coincidence of thallium and germanium is only found when the tooth filling metal has these pollutants. She is very upset about this since she states that she has had weak hands (very weak) for many years already (caused by thallium).

She says this tooth has been bothering her. I then searched for the loca tion of the thallium and found it at tooth #29, 10, and 18. She will ask the dentist to do a fresh panoramic X-ray to search for tattoos. I shone a flashlight in her mouth and could see 2 tattoos. However, these metal pinpoint leftovers might be left from the br aces she used to wear. She states she remembers seeing them after the braces were removed. : PCB (Toxic Element) YES Uses Dr. Bronner's Peppermint TM soap - will go off. Summary: Lenore's case is especially tragic and an early warning sign for all people. She was given 16 mercury fillings starting in early childhood, some of which were pollu ted with thallium. This was the probable cause of having a child with microcephaly. In an effort to im- prove her health, she turned to health brand soap, only to be poisoned with PCBs. Only her strong intellig ence and survival instinct kept her from self-destructive anger. Inst ead, she will probably set herself and her family on the road to good health. 84 Phylis Zink Liver and Breast Cancer and HIV Phylis is a 46 year old woman who drove by herself 150 miles for reasons of her history of breast cancer. It was discovered by mammo- gram. She had a mastectomy and they took out 3 lymph nodes two years ago and has been followed since then by annual mammograms. She has a heart murmur, occasional pain in knees and wrists, and a long history of period-related problems. They have a water softener and use reverse osmosis (R.O.) water for drinking. : Ortho-phospho-tyrosine (Cancer) YES : Protein 24 (HIV) YES Since these results seemed impossi ble to her and I was afraid she might leave, do nothing about her status, and never return, I sug- gested she get a clinical test (p24 antigen test) for HIV."},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"P ART T HREE : C ASE H ISTORIES 397 Six weeks later She waited two weeks before doing the test and it came back NO (negative) for the HIV virus.

Summary: Joe and his wife made the changes in their family's habits that were necessary to get rid of his cancer and protect the whole family from getting cancer or HIV illness in the future. 86 Ray Broyles Cancer and HIV We first saw Ray two years ago. He was age 40 at that time and had just had an unusual experience. He had always been healthy and energetic. Then for no reason he passed out. He began vomiting, felt extremely weak and had other strange symptoms. His regular doctor prescribed a tranquilizer, Oxazepam TM , after ruling out numerous pos- sibilities. However, these attacks r ecurred, and he lost about 10 pounds in a few months. I did not suspect nor test for cancer. I found the para- site, Trichuris, and heavy metals from tooth fillings as well as tungsten"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 400 from his electric hot water heater. He was put on a parasite program. He became well but did not clear up the me tal problems. He did not stay on a maintenance program for killing parasites. We did not see him till recently. He had no further episodes of passing out but was unable to recover from a recent flu. This time the parasite test revealed Fasciolopsis in the liver. He was put back on the parasite killing r ecipe. The cancer test, ortho-phospho- tyrosine, was positive, and tungsten wa s showing its presence in all his body tissues. He soon got rid of his cancer and by changing his water sources and doing dental work he got rid of the tungsten problem. (He stopped all use of electrical frying pans and toasters.) He felt fine, his former self, and was released with food and body product restrictions. We saw him again a half year later for frequent burping and diffi- culty swallowing. There was some similarity to his original attacks. There was pain over his chest and hear t area, but I did not suspect HIV at that time. The parasite test showed heartworm and dog tapeworm eggs. The cancer test was negative. He was put on a high dose parasite killing program and dental repair was recommended. This cleared up his health problems, again, temporarily. He was not given food or product restrictions.

His sister-in-law drove him to our office. Jason smokes, and I reminded him that smoking is incompatible with lung health. He is on Dilantin TM and Decatron TM to prevent brain swelling.  Protein 24 (HIV) NO : Ortho-phospho-tyrosine (Cancer) YES at liver, thymus, lung, brain Note that cancer in the thymus is quite rare. : Fasciolopsis (Parasite) YES at liver, intestine, lung : Fasciolopsis cercaria (Parasite) YES at lung, etc. : Sheep liver fluke (Parasite) YES at thymus; NO at liver Note: the normal habitat for the Sheep liver fluke is the liver.

He is still smoking. I emphasized the importance of stopping. At his first visit, Jason had AIDS but without the HIV virus; the picture of AIDS is seen in the 4 out of 5 YES (positive) tests. At his second visit, the parasites had reached adulthood in his thymus and the virus is present; his AIDS is wors- ened. Summary: Maybe I was too harsh with Jason about his smoking, so that he won't come back. But if he doesn't stop he can't survive. It is weeks past his appointment time. I am afraid it is only his sister-in-law who wants Jason to survive, not Jason himself. Ralph Smith Multiple Cancer and HIV Ralph, age 43, came to our office because of his sarcoidosis which was diagnosed six years ago, although he had had it earlier than that. At that time, he had pain on the center front chest so that he couldn't breathe deeply. He was put on cortisone for it and the pain was reduced, but it is still minimally present.

She is one of our most notable failures, since she has never become well. For this reason, I suspect tapeworm disease. It has been only recently that I learned how to detect the encysted heads (scolices) of tapeworms buried in some tissue, since it is not present in the white blood cells where I make my initial searches. For this reason, we invited her into our office, specifically, to test. : Taenia solium scolex (Tapeworm) YES at muscle and spleen : Moniezia scolex (Tapeworm) YES at muscle, intestine and spleen I suspect these “bladder cysts” ha ve become eroded by solvent, releasing eggs and some segments into the tissue.

I began by expl aining that her shoulder and upper arm pain is caused by gallstones in the liver; she can easily wash them out in one evening and be free of shoulder pa in the next day. Her hand and foot pain is due to kidney stones and she can dissolve these out in 3 to 4 weeks with our herbal recipe.

Gail Lima Kidney, Bladder Cancer Gail is a health-minded woman, age 51, who came from Michigan with her husband. She had a long list of problems in spite of eating or- ganic food, very little meat, had no vices and didn't even drink carbon- ated beverages. She had tinnitus in her left ear, dry skin and lips, tight neck and shoulder so as to give her headaches. Her heart frequently began to pound for no reason. Her kn ees and wrists were weak and painful. She had low back pain and gas pains and foot pain. She didn't sleep well and felt anxious most of the time. Her energy level and con- centration were low. She suffered fro m panic attacks and depression. She said she had hypoglycemia, chronic fatigue and Candida, 3 modem diseases that suggested parasites a nd pollution.

He wanted to arrange an appointment with a psychiatrist for her but she declined. This viewpoint of her doctor's could have been based on her numerous symptoms and health orientation, suggesting hypochondria. Upon checking the urinalysis she brought with her, it showed numerous bacteria, WBCs and cloudiness.

But he has certainly made a sincere effort in every other way. Finale I hope you reach the same conclusions as I did from these case histories: • Cancer is simply a side effect of parasite infestation and solvent accumulation. It is not a permanent, mortal dis- ease. • It is amazing how easy the cancer side effect is to cure— Fasciolopsis buskii is one of the first to succumb to the parasite killing herbs—but it often doesn't bring relief, be- cause the problems that started the initial tumor growing haven't been corrected. • Cancer blinds us to our real problems, like seeping den- tal metal and plastic, toxic body products, hidden pollu- tion in our favorite foods, and toxins in our environment. These destroy our lives. • No matter what kind of cancer you have , a complete program of lifting the burdens on your immune system will miraculously clear it up. • Tumors will shrink if you remove the dozen or so causes that contribute to them. These causes are not mysterious, just more parasites and toxins. It seems quite clear that ALL cancers are alike, although different organs are picked to be the target. Cancers typically start with tumor formation, due to about a dozen causative fac- tors. These factors cause numerous mutations which are the fo- cus of many current microbiological studies. The tumors turn malignant with the invasion by Fasciolopsis and isopropyl al- cohol."},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":" 457 How To Test Yourself This chapter describes how to make and use the electronic device that lets you do the same tests that I did, and that led to the discoveries in this book. It is natural to be skeptical that you can accumulate isopro- pyl alcohol from your shampoo, or that there is anything toxic in soft drinks, or you should change your house plumbing, or you should remove your gold crowns. But you can look for toxins in all these items for yourself, and you may luckily find that you do not have them! It is only from years of expe rience testing every product cli- ents brought in, or that I samp led from the grocery and drug store, that I make generalizations like “all cold cereals have toxic solvents,” or “all meat has parasites.” But obviously no one can test them all. Maybe your brand is OK! Or perhaps it is not. Unless you test for yourself you must rigorously follow the advice in this book. Remember these tests can only say YES there is something in this food (or water sample or ai r sample or pill or potion) that my white blood cells (indicating your immune system) are busy removing. Or NO my white blood cells are not working on this 62 . And except for very high amounts, it is hard to say how much of a bad effect the toxi n is having. But with repeated testing you can even find that out. Suppose your hair spray tests YES (positive) in your immune sy stem five minutes after using it, but not after twenty minutes . This, you may feel, is an ac-   62 Testing in the white blood cells is the best way I have found to both diagnose and predict illness.

Or you may find it tests YES even though you washed it out of your ha ir yesterday. That would be a strong indication that you are accumulating at least some of the toxins from your hair spra y in your body, and not only must you not use it, you must find a way to reduce your levels! Again, your own tests will be better than my general advice; but without them, you must follow my advice to get well. All of the results obtained in this book can be duplicated by a person with skills at the high school level. No knowledge of electronics is required. When possible, we include Radio Shack catalog numbers to describe materials. This is for convenience only. Equivalents are usually available at any electronics store. A videotape is available that demonstrates how to make and use a Syncrometer TM (see Sources ). Leads If you are new to electronics you will need to know what a lead is. A lead is simply a wire used to connect two parts elec- trically. The method of clippi ng the lead to the component (part) determines its name. An alligator clip test lead uses a small metal clothespin for connecting, while a mini-hook clip lead is like a small, spring-loaded crochet hook. The mini-hook is best for attaching to a wire, the alligator clip is best for larger connections like to the test surfaces. Leads come in many different lengths and are carried by all electronics stores."},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"H OW T O T EST Y OURSELF 459 The testing device consists of four parts the test surfaces, probe and handhold, speaker, and circuit.

The Easy Way Circuit Build The Electrosonic Human (in the 200 in One Elec- tronic Project Lab by Science Fair, Cat. No. 28-265, at Radio Shack). It's easy and fun. If your kit has a different catalog number you may have different connection numbers. Instead of connecting the probe to terminal T2, just clip it directly to terminal 137, and remove the 137-T2 wire. Simi- larly, clip the handhold to terminal 76 and remove the 76-26 and 25-T1 wires. This also removes the 4.7K resistor which is not necessary. Later, when you use the probe to press against your knuckle you may find it painful. In this case try substituting the .005 microfarad capacitor for the .01 mi crofarad capacitor in the cir- cuit. If you are using Cat. No. 28-262, you may connect the speaker as described. With Cat.

Mount the light switch (a) just like you did for the test plates on the front of the s hoe box. Mount it in the regular way so that ON is UP and label the box clearly. Turn light switch OFF before continuing. 3. Pierce a hole with a large nail or pencil for the shaft of the potentiometer (b), and a smaller hole for the tab on the side of the potentiometer (the tab keeps the potentiometer from rotating when you turn the switch). Remove the nut and washer from the base of the potentiometer shaft, in- sert the shaft into the hole from the inside of the shoe box. Trim the excess cardboard around the shaft with a knife. Replace the washer, nut, and tighten securely. 4. Attach the knob (c) to the shaft. Use a very small screw driver or pointed knife to tighten. 5. Pierce holes in the box with a pin for the .1 microfarad capacitor (d) and the .0047 microf arad capacitor (e). Push the wires of each capacitor through the holes from the outside. When the ceramic part is almost touching the box, bend the wires inside to keep it in place.

Bend the base wire away to the left slightly so you will be able to insert the transistor into the triangle of holes. A diagram on the transistor package tells you that the top wire is the “collector” and the bottom wire is the “emitter”. Insert the transistor from the outside of the box so each wire goes where it is supposed to, and bend the wires sideways to secure. 7. Pierce seven holes for the transformer (g). There should be 2 wires on one side and 3 on the other. All wires"},{"pageNumber":496,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 470 should have the ends bared and available for connections.

Notice that the tr ansformer has 2 little mounting tabs. Push them through the box and bend them down with a knife or screwdriver on the inside to keep the trans- former firmly in place or tape the transformer to the out- side of the box. Then thread the 5 wires through their respective holes. 8. Prepare the battery holder (i) by cutting the wires to no more than two inches. Bare the ends of the wires for ¼ inch.

Finally attach the speaker where shown. In the picture there are both mini- hook and alligator clips depict ed, but it is not important which kind you use, only that you make secure connec- tions. 11. Test the circuit. Turn the speaker on, and the volume half way. Turn the Syncromete r (light switch) ON. Test the circuit by briefly touching the probe to the handhold. The speaker should produce a sound like popping corn (readjust speaker volume to a comfortable level). If you hear nothing, go over each step carefully. Make sure the batteries are fresh. Recheck all connections, especially ones made to stripped wires. Replace the lid and turn the shoe box over so it sits on its lid. 12. Label the potentiometer. Turn the knob almost fully clockwise. Mark the box where the line on the knob points. Grasp the handhold in one hand and press the probe with your thumb. Listen to the pitch. Now turn the knob almost fully counter-clockwise, mark the box, and listen to this pitch. Whichever pitch is higher label MAX (maximum) on the box. 13. You did it! Turn off the speaker and Syncrometer.

This will be called the “tissue switch”. Choose one of your test plates as the “substance plate.” Your existing switch to that plate is equivalent to the “substance switch.” Using an alligator clip, connect the substance plate to one screw terminal on the light switch. Using another alligator clip connect the other screw term inal to your other test surface (the “tissue plate”). You were probably trained to listen for a slight current in- crease when testing substances. The concept was if the sub- stance was anywhere in th e body there would be higher conductance. You must retrain yourself to listen for something more ob- vious, resonance . Resonance will occur when a substance and a tissue specimen are placed on your test plates that precisely match a body tissue and substance. With the additional infor- mation of where the substance has accumulated in the body, you can make much more accurate determinations how prob- lems originate. You now have the following equipment: • Electronic circuit with speaker • Test surfaces • Probe and handhold You are ready to learn to use them."},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"H OW T O T EST Y OURSELF 475 Troubleshooting Don't reduce the size of the copper pipes. Keep all wires as short as possible. Use fresh batteries. Don’t try to make the Syncrometer all in one box. The test plates are separate for a reason. Keep the lead to the test plate box short, however, and neither it nor the wires to the speaker should pass near other electrical components like the batteries. Using The Syncrometer Fill a saucer with cold tap wa ter. Fold a paper towel four times and place it in this dish. It should be entirely wet. Cut paper strips about 1 inch wide from a piece of white, unfragranced, paper towel. Dampen a paper strip on the towel and wind it around the large metal handhold to completely cover it. The wetness improves conductivity and the paper towel keeps the metal off your skin. • Turn the Syncrometer and speaker to ON. • Start with the substance and tissue switches OFF. • Test the plate connections, if you haven't done so recently. Touch the handhold to the substance plate briefly, then the tissue plate. There should be no crackle from the speaker. Turn the substance switch ON. Touch both plates briefly again. Only the substance plate should crackle. Now turn the tissue switch ON. Both plates should crackle. Turn both plate switches OFF again. Check your connections once a week. Pick up the handhold, squeeze it free of excess water. Pick up the probe in the same hand, holding it like a pen, between thumb and forefinger."},{"pageNumber":502,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 476 Dampen your other hand by making a fist and dunking your knuckles into the wet paper towe l in the saucer. You will be using the area on top of the first knuckle of the forefinger or middle finger to learn the technique. Become proficient with both. Immediately after dunking your knuckles dry them on a paper towel folded in quarters a nd placed beside the saucer. The degree of dampness of your skin affects the resistance in the circuit and is a very important variable that you must learn to keep constant. Make your probe as soon as your knuckles have been dried (within two seconds) si nce they begin to air dry fur- ther immediately. With the handhold and probe both in one hand press the probe against the knuckle of the other hand, keeping the knuckles tightly bent. Press lightly at first, then harder, taking one second. Count it out as “a t housand and one.” Repeat the probe a half second later at the same location. There is an addi- tive effect. The first probe ope ns your cells' conductance chan- nels. The second probe tests to h ear if they are indeed open.; These are considered the two halves of a single complete probe. All of this takes less than three seconds. Don't linger because your body will change and your next probe will be affected. Subsequent probes are made in exactly the same way. As you develop skill, your probes will become identical. Plan to practice for one to two hours each day. It takes most people at least twelve hours of practice in or der to be so consistent with their probes that they can hear the slight difference when the circuit is resonant. For reference you may wish to use a piano. The starting sound when you touch down on the sk in should be F, an octave and a half above middle C. The sound rises to a C as you press to the knuckle bone, then slips b ack to B, then back up to C- sharp as you complete the second half of your first probe. If you have a multitester you can connect it in series with the handhold or probe: the current should rise to about 50 mi-"},{"pageNumber":503,"pageContent":"H OW T O T EST Y OURSELF 477 croamps. If you have a frequenc y counter the frequency should hit 1000 Hz. You should reach C-sharp just before the probe becomes painful. Adjust the potentiometer to make this possible. Mark the box STD (standard) at this setting. We will call this the standard state. Two things change the sound of the probe even when your technique is identical: 1. The patch of skin chosen for probing will change its prop- erties. The more it is used, the redder it gets and the higher the sound goes when you probe. Move to a nearby location when the sound is too high to begin with, rather than adjusting the potentiometer. 2. Your body has cycles which make the sound go noticea- bly higher and lower. If you are getting strangely higher sounds for identical probes, stop and probe every five minutes until you think the sound has gone down to stan- dard. This could take five to twenty minutes. Learn this higher sound so you can avoid testing during this period. Nervousness or excitement raises the sound. Eating may lower it. A method is given in lesson one to determine whether you are in the standard state for testing. 3. You may also find times when it is impossible to reach the necessary sound without pressing so hard it causes pain. You may adjust the potentiomete r if that helps. Or wait for your body to return to standard. Remember to set the potentiometer back to STD later. There will be times when the STD pitch is higher than usual (especially in younger persons). Exchanging the .0047 microfarad ca- pacitor for a .01 microfarad capacitor helps fix this."},{"pageNumber":504,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 478 All tests are momentary. This means less than one second. It is tempting to hold the probe to your skin and just listen to the sound go up and down, but if you prolong the test you mu st let your body rest ten min- utes, each time, before resuming probe practice! For our purposes, it is not necessary to locate acupuncture points. Syncrometer Resonance The information you are seeking is whether or not there is resonance in the circuit. If ther e is the test is YES (positive). You hear resonance by comparing the second probe to the first. You are not merely comparing pitch. Resonance is a tone qual- ity in addition to a higher pitch. During resonance a higher pitch is reached faster; it seems to want to go infinitely high. If there is resonance it will be hear d as the probe pressure nears maximum, as a rule. Remember more electricity flows, and the pitch gets higher, as your skin reddens or your body changes cycle. These effects are not resonance. Resonance is a small extra hum at the high end of the probe. As soon as you hear it, stop probing. Your body needs a short recovery time (10 to 20 seconds) after every resonant probe. The longer the resonant probe, the longer the recovery time to reach the standard level again. Using musical notes, here is a NO (negative) result: F-C-B- C# (first probe) F-C-B-C# (compa re, it is the same sound). Here is a YES (positive) result: F-C- B-C# (first probe) F-D (stop quickly because you heard resonance). (In between the"},{"pageNumber":505,"pageContent":"H OW T O T EST Y OURSELF 479 first and second probe a tissue w ill be switched in per lessons below.) It is not possible to produ ce a resonant sound by pressing harder on the skin, although you can make the pitch go higher. To avoid confusion it is important to practice making probes of the same pressure. (Practice getting the F-C-B-C# tune.) Lesson One Purpose: To identify the sound of resonance in the circuit. Materials: Potentized (homeopathic) solutions. Prepare these as follows: find three medium size vitamin bottles, glass or plastic, with non-metal lids. Remove any shreds of paper sticking to the rim. Rinse well w ith cold tap water. Then rinse again with filtered tap water. Pour filtered cold tap water into the first bottle to a depth of about ½ inch. Add 50 little grains of table salt. Replace the lid. Make sure the outside is clean. If not, rinse and dry. Now shake hard, holding it snugly in your hand. Count your shakes; shake 120 to 150 times. Use elbow motion so each shake covers about an eight inch distance. Shaken samples are different from un- shaken ones, that's why this is so important. When done label the bottle on its side and lid: SALT #1. Wash your hands (without soap). Next, pour about the same amount of filtered water into the second and third bottles. Open SALT #1 and pour a small amount, like ¼ to ½ of a teaspoon (do not use a spoon) into the second and third bottles. Close all bottles. Now shake the sec- ond bottle the same as the first. Clean it and label it SALT #2. Do the same for the third bottle . Label it SALT #2 also and set aside for Lesson Three. These two solutions have unique properties. SALT #1 al- ways resonates. Use #1 to train your ear. SALT #2 shouldn't"},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 480 resonate. Use #2 to hear when you have returned to your stan- dard state. Method: Place SALT #2 on the substance plate and SALT #1 on the tissue plate. 1. Turn the Syncrometer and speaker ON. 2. Start with both the substance and tissue switches OFF. 3. Make your first probe (F-C-B-C#). 4. Immediately flip the substance switch ON and repeat the probe. Use only one half second to operate the switch. This is why these switches are mounted “upside down”, because it is faster to move the toggle down. The result should be a NO (negative). If the second probe sounds even a little higher you are not at the standard level. Wait a few more seconds and go back to step 2. 5. If the first result was NO, you may immediately flip the tissue switch ON. (Again do this within one half second.) This time the circuit was resonating. Learn to hear the dif- ference between the last two probes. 6. The skin must now be rested When SALT #1 is placed in the circuit there is always resonance whether you hear it or not. Therefore, always take the time to rest the skin. 7. How can you be sure that the skin is rested enough? Any time you want to know whether you have returned to the standard level, you may simply test yourself to SALT #2 (just do steps 2, 3 and 4). Wh ile you are learning, let your piano also help you to learn the standard level (starts ex- actly at F). If you do not rest and you resonate the circuit before returning to the standa rd level, the results will be- come aberrant and useless. The briefer you keep the reso- nant probe, the faster you return to the standard level. Don't exceed one half second when probing SALT #1. Hopefully you will soon hear resonance within that time. 8. This lesson teaches you to first listen to the empty plate, then to SALT #2, then to SALT #1. In later lessons you"},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":"H OW T O T EST Y OURSELF 481 simply use two probes, substance and substance-plus- tissue, because we assume you checked for your standard level. Practice hearing resonance in your circuit every day. White Blood Cells Checking for resonance between your white blood cells and a toxin is the single most important test you can make. Your white blood cells are your immune system's first line of defense. In addition to ma king antibodies, interferon, inter- leukins, and other attack chemicals, they also “eat” foreign sub- stances in your body and eliminate them. By simply checking your white blood cells for toxins or intruders you save having to check every other tissue in your body. Because no matter where the foreign substance is, chances are some white blood cells are working on removing it. It took me two years to find this ideal indicator, but it is not perfect. Tapeworms are a notable exception. They can be en- cysted in a particular tissue wh ich will test positive, while the white blood cells continue to test negative. Freon is another notable exception. Also, when bacteria and viruses are in their latent form , they do not show up in the white blood cells. For- tunately, in their active form they show up quite nicely. Again, when toxins or invaders are not plentiful, they may not appear in the white blood cells, although they can be found in a tissue. Making A White Blood Cell Specimen Obtain an empty vitamin bottle with a flat plastic lid and a roll of clear tape. The white blood cells are not going into the"},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 482 bottle, they are going on the bottle. The bottle simply makes them easy to handle. Rinse and dry the bottle. Make a second specimen on a clean glass slide if available. Squeeze an oil gland on your face or body to obtain a rib- bon of whitish matter (not mixed with blood). Pick this up with the back of your thumb nail. Spread it in a single, small streak across the lid of the bottle or the center of the glass slide. Stick a strip of clear tape over the streak on the bottle cap so that the ends hang over the edge and you can easily see where the specimen was put (see photo). Wipe the lid beside the tape to make sure no white blood cells are uncovered. Apply a drop of balsam and a cover slip to the slide prepara- tion. Both types of preparation will give you identical results. The bottle type of white blood cell specime n is used by standing it on its lid (upside down). The lid is used because it is flat, whereas the bottom of most bottles is not. Lesson Two Purpose: To add a white blood cell specimen to the circuit and compare sound. Method: 1. Turn the Syncrometer and speaker ON. 2. Start with both the substance and tissue switches OFF. 3. Place the white blood cell specimen on the substance plate. 4. Listen to the first probe. Fig. 89 A White Blood Cell Specimen"},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"H OW T O T EST Y OURSELF 483 5. Immediately (one half second) turn the substance switch ON and probe again. 6. There should be no difference in sound levels and no resonance. 7. Make sure both plate switches are again OFF. 8. Treat yourself to some junk food. Reserve a piece in a sealed plastic bag. 9. Move your white blood cell specimen to the tissue plate. Place the junk food sample on the substance plate. 10. Listen to the first probe. 11.

Lesson Three Purpose: To determine your percent accuracy in listening for resonance. Materials: the SALT #1 and two SALT #2 solutions you made for Lesson One. Method: move the SALT #1 and SALT #2 labels to the bottom of the bottles so you can not tell which bottle is which. 1. Turn the Syncrometer and speaker ON. 2. Start with both the substance and tissue switches OFF. 3. Mix the bottles up, select one at random, and place it on the substance plate. 4. Make your first probe."},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 484 5. Turn the substance switch to ON and make your second probe. 6. Resonance indicates a SALT #1, no resonance indicates SALT #2. Check the bottom. Remember to rest after the SALT #1, whether or not you heard resonance. 7. Repeat steps 3 through 5 a number of times. Work toward getting three out of three correct. Practice every day. Trouble shooting: a) If you repeat this experiment and you keep getting the same bottles “wrong”, start over . You may have acciden- tally contaminated or mislabeled the outside of the bottle, or switched bottle caps. b) If you get different bottles wrong each time, the plates may be contaminated. Wash the outside of the bottles and rinse with filtered water and dry. Wipe the plates very well, too, with filtered water and dry. c) If all the bottles read the same, your cold tap water is polluted. Change the filter. Preparing Test Substances It is possible to prepare dry s ubstances for testing such as a piece of lead or grains of pesticid e. They can simply be kept in a plastic bag and placed on the test plate. However, I prefer to place a small amount (the size of a pea) of the substance into a ½ ounce bottle of filtered water. There will be many chemical reactions between the substance and the water to produce a number of test substances all contained in one bottle. This simulates the situation in the body. Within the body, where salt and water are abundant, similar reactions may occur between elements and water. For example, a strip of pure (99.9% pure) c opper placed in filtered water might yield copper hydroxide, c uprous oxide, cupric oxide,"},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":"H OW T O T EST Y OURSELF 485 copper dioxide, and so forth. These may be similar to some of the reaction products one might expect in the body, coming from a copper IUD, copper bracel et or copper plumbing. Since the electronic properties of elemental copper are not the same as for copper compounds, we would miss many test results if we used only dry elemental copper as a test substance. Impure Test Substances It is not necessary to have pure test substances. For instance, a tire balancer made of lead can be easily obtained at an auto service station. Leaded gasoline and lead fishing weights also make good test substances for lead. There is a disadvantage, though, to using im pure test substances. You are including the extra impurities in your test. If your lead object also has tin in it, you are also testing for tin. Usually, you can infer the truth by some caref ul maneuvering. If you have searched your kidneys for leaded gasoline, fishing weights and tire balancers and all 3 are resonant with your kidneys, you may infer that you have lead in your kidneys since the common element in all 3 items is lead. (You will learn how to specify a tissue, such as your kidneys, later.) Using pure chemicals gives you certainty in your results. You can purchase pure chemicals from chemical supply com- panies (see Sources ). Your pharmacy, a child's chemistry set, a paint store, or biological supply company can also supply some. The biggest repository of all toxic substances is the grocery store and your own home. You can make test substances out of your hand soap, water softener salt, and laundry detergent by putting a small amount (1/16 tsp.) in a ½ ounce glass bo ttle and adding about 2 tsp. fil-"},{"pageNumber":512,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 486 tered water. (Or for quick testing just put them dry or wet in a sealed plastic baggie.) Always use a plastic measuring spoon. Check the items in Toxic Elements (see The Tests ) to see where they are commonly found. For instance, arsenic is in car- pets, stuffed furniture and wallpaper, originating in the pesti- cide put there. Here are some suggestions for finding sources of toxic products to make your own toxic element test. If the product is a solid, place a small am ount in a plastic bag and add a tablespoon of filtered water to get a temporary test product. For permanent use put it in a sm all amber glass bottle. If the product is a liquid, pour a few drops into a glass bottle and add about 2 tsp. filtered water. Keep all toxic substances in glass bottles for your own safety. Small amber glass dropper bottles can be purchased by the dozen at drug stores (also see Sources ). Aflatoxin: scrape the mold off an orange or piece of bread; wash hands afterward. Acetone: paint supply store or pharmacy. Arsenic: 1/16 tsp. of arsenate pesticide from a garden shop. A snippet of flypaper. Aluminum: a piece of aluminum foil (not tin foil) or an aluminum measuring spoon. Aluminum silicate: a bit of salt that has this free running agent in it. Asbestos: a small piece of asbestos sheeting, an old furnace gasket, 1/4 inch of a clothe s dryer belt that does not say “Made in USA”, or a crumb of building material being removed due to its asbestos content (ask a contractor). Barium: save a few drops from the beverage given clients scheduled for an X-ray. Lipstick that has barium listed in the ingredients.

Nickel: a nickel plated paper clip, a washed coin. Patulin (apple mold): cut a sliver of bruised apple that has turned brown, wash and peel fi rst to avoid the benzene in the spray that may be on the peel. PCB: water from a quarry known to be polluted with it (a builder or electrical worker may know a source). Platinum: ask a jeweler for a small specimen.

Vanadium: hold a piece of dampened paper towel over a gas stove burner as it is turned on. Cut a bit of this paper into your specimen bottle and add 2 tsp. filtered water. Xylene: paint store or pharmacy. Zearalenone: combine leftover crumbs of three kinds of corn chips and three kinds of popcorn. This list gets you off to a good start. Since few of these specimens are pure, there is a degree of logic that you must ap- ply in most cases. If you are tes ting for barium in your breast, a positive result would mean that a barium-containing lip stick tests positive and a barium-free lip stick is negative. A chemistry set for hobbyists is a wonderful addition to your collection of test specimens. Remember, however, the as- sumptions and errors in such a system. A test for silver using silver chloride might be negative. This does not mean there is no silver present in your body; it only means there is no silver chloride present in the tissue you tested. You are bound to miss some toxins; don't let this discourage you. There is more than enough that you can find. The most fruitful kind of te sting is, probably, the use of household products themselves as test substances. The soaps, colognes, mouthwash, toothpaste, shampoo, cosmetics, breads, dairy products, juices and cereals can all be made into test specimens. Put about 1/8 tsp. of the product in a small glass bottle, add 2 tsp. filtered water and ¼ tsp. grain alcohol to pre- serve it. If you test positive to these, then you shouldn't use them, even if you can not identify the exact toxin or pathogen."},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 490 Finally, there is the error from the filtered water you are using. Test it by tasting it, then searching your white blood cells for it. If you find it there, change the filter and repeat the test. Make a test sample of this water alone. Lesson Four Purpose: To determine toxicity of your household products. Materials: Prepare samples of wh at you ate at your last meal. Also prepare samples of the soap, shampoo, shaving cream and other products you last put on your body. Method: Listen for resonance between your white blood cells and the daily foods and products you use. 1. Place your white blood cell specimen on the tissue plate. 2. Place your first sample on the substance plate. 3. Test for resonance. 4. Make two piles. Things th at resonate go in the TOXIC pile, things that don't go in the SAFE pile. Don't be sur- prised if your health brand shampoo “flunks” the test. And if your vitamin C flunks, I hope you write a letter to the manufacturer! Making Organ Specimens To test for toxic elements or parasites in a particular organ such as the liver or skin, you will need either a fresh or frozen sample of the organ or a prepared microscope slide of this or- gan. Meat purchased from a grocer y store, fresh or frozen, pro- vides you with a variety of organ specimens. Chicken, turkey, beef or pork organs all give th e same results. You may purchase chicken gizzards for a sample of stomach, beef liver for liver,"},{"pageNumber":517,"pageContent":"H OW T O T EST Y OURSELF 491 pork brains for brain, beef steak for muscle, sweet breads for thymus, tripe for stomach lining. Other organs may be ordered from a meat packing plant. Trim the marrow out of a bone slice to get bone marrow. Scrub the bone slice with hot water to free it of marrow to get a bone specimen. Choose a single pi ece of meat sample, rinse it and place it in a plastic bag. You may freeze it. To make a du- rable unfrozen sample, cut a sma ll piece, the size of a pea, and place it in an amber glass bottle (½ oz.). Cover with two tsp. filtered water and ¼ tsp. of gr ain alcohol (pure vodka will do) to preserve it. These need not be refrigerated but if decay starts, make a fresh specimen. Pork brains from the grocery store may be dissected to give you the different parts of the brain. Chicken livers often have an attached gallbladder or piece of bile duct, giving you that extra organ. Grocery store “lites” pr ovides you with lung tissue. For kidney, snip a piece off pork or beef kidney. Beef liver may supply you with a blood sample, too. Saliva, urine and semen may be your own. Use less than ¼ tsp. of each fluid. Add about 2 tsp. (10 ml) filtered water and a small amount (¼ tsp.) of grain alcohol to preserve them. This dilution of natural fluids is essential to get correct results. I use ½ oz amber glass bottles with bakelite caps (see Sources ) to hold specimens. After closing, each bottle is sealed with a Parafilm TM strip to avoid accidental loosening of the cap. However, plastic bags or other containers would suffice. To make a specimen of skin, use hangnail bits and skin peeled from a callous, not a wart . A few shreds will do. Re- member, they must be very close to the test plate when in use; add 2 tsp. filtered water and ¼ tsp. grain alcohol."},{"pageNumber":518,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 492 Making a Complete Set of Tissue Samples My original complete set was made from a frozen fish. As it thawed, different organs were cut away and small pieces placed in bottles for preserving in cold tap water and grain alcohol. In this way, organs not available fr om the grocery store could be obtained. The piece of intestine closest to the anus corresponds to our colon, the part closest to the stomach corresponds to our duodenum. The 2 layers of the stom ach and different layers of the eye, the optic nerve and spinal cord were obtained this way. Another complete set of tissue samples were obtained from a freshly killed steer at a sla ughter house. In this way the 4 chambers of the heart were obtained, the lung, trachea, aorta, vein, pancreas, and so forth. Purchasing a Complete Set of Tissue Samples Slides of tissues, unstained or stained in a variety of ways for microscope study give identical results to the preparations made by yourself in the ways already described. This fact opens the entire catalog of tissue t ypes for your further study. See “microscope slides and equipment” in Sources for places that supply them. Fig. 90 Some purchased parasite and tissue slides"},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":"H OW T O T EST Y OURSELF 493 You now have a set of organ samples, either fresh, frozen, preserved or on slides. You also have a set of test substances, whether chemical compounds, or elements, or products. Your goal is to search in your own organs and body tissues for the substances that may be robbing you of health. Keeping yourself healthy will soon be an easy, daily rou- tine. Body Fluid Specimens The human body emits a wide range of frequencies. Body fluids retain these frequencies and always resonate. To reduce this effect you must dilute all body fluids before using them. Then you will only hear resonance with substances that are ac- tually in the body fluid. Each of these fluids should be prepared by putting about ¼ tsp. in a ½ oz amber glass bottle. Add about 2 tsp. filtered water and ¼ tsp. grain alcohol for preservation. It is important not to shake the specimen, but to mix gently. Urine. It is desired to have a pure, uninfected urine sample as a tissue specimen. Since this cannot be proved with certainty, obtain several urine samples fr om different persons whom you believe to be healthy and make several test specimens in order to compare results. Label your specimens Urine A (child), Urine B (woman), Urine C (mine), and so forth. Semen. A sample from a condom is adequate. Aged speci- mens (sent by mail, unpreserved and unrefrigerated) work well also. Use one to ten drops or scrape a small amount. Blood. One to ten drops of blood should be used. A bit of white paper towel for swabbing ma y be used. Clotted or chemi-"},{"pageNumber":520,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 494 cally treated blood is satisfactory. A blood smear on a slide is very convenient. Milk. Cow's milk is too polluted with parasites and chemi- cals to be useful. Electronically, a dead specimen is equivalent to a live specimen, so that past eurization of the milk does not help. A human milk specimen is preferred. Saliva. Use your own, if you have deparasitized yourself and test negative to various fl uke stages. Otherwise find a well friend or child. You Will Now Be Able to Test in Three Different Ways! When you test with a substa nce on one plate and nothing on the other, you are searching your entire body for that substance. Such a test is not very sensitiv e, but it lets you pick out your worst toxins. By putting a tissue sample on th e other plate you are testing for the substance specifically in that tissue in your body, and this is much more sensitive. Th e tissue need not be the white blood cells. To find mercury in your kidneys you would use a mercury sample on one plate, and a kidney sample on the other. The technique is the same as when you use white blood cells. If you put a substance on each plate, a resonating circuit means the two samples have something in common. For exam- ple, if you have mercury on one plate and some dental floss on the other, a positive result indicates mercury in the floss. Lesson Five Purpose: To watch substances travel through your body."},{"pageNumber":521,"pageContent":"H OW T O T EST Y OURSELF 495 Materials: Prepare a pint of brow n sugar solution (white sugar has isopropyl alcohol polluti on) using filtered water. Use about 1 tsp. brown sugar, 1/8 ts p. vitamin C (to detoxify sor- ghum mold), and a pint of filtere d water. Do not shake it; gently mix. Make a sample bottle by pouring about ½ inch into a clean used vitamin bottle. Rinse and dry the outside of the sample bottle. Finally wash your hands with plain water. Method: 1. Test your skin for the presen ce of brown sugar, using the newly made sample bottle and your skin specimen. It should not be there (resonate) yet. 2. Prepare a paper applicator by tearing the corner from a white unfragranced paper towel. Fold it to make a wick. 3. Dip the paper wick in the pint of sugar water and apply it to the skin of your inner arm where you can rub freely. Rub it in vigorously for about 10 seconds (otherwise it takes minutes to absorb). Leave the shredded wick on the skin and tape it down with a piece of clear tape about 4 inches long (this increases the time you have to work). Quickly wash your fingers. 4. Place your skin tissue specimen on one plate and the sugar specimen bottle on the other plate. 5. Probe for resonance every 5 seconds. As soon as you hear resonance, implying that the skin has absorbed the sugar solution (which may take a full minute), replace the skin specimen with one of liver a nd listen for resonance again. There should be none, yet. 6. Alternate between the skin a nd liver. Soon the skin will be clear and the liver will resonate. Also check the pancreas and muscles to see how quickly sugar arrives there. 7. Check white blood cells and kidneys. It should not appear here (unless it is polluted with a toxin)."},{"pageNumber":522,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 496 8. After five to ten minutes the sugar will be gone from all of these tissues and your experiment is ended. Wash your arm with plain water. Notice that you have only a few minutes to get all your testing done after the skin has absorbed the test substances. Lesson Six Purpose: To verify the isopropyl alcohol and benzene lists. Method: We will use the Syncrometer to test for a toxin in a product. Assemble the products named in the isopropyl alco- hol list (page 45) and benzene list (page 163) ... as many as you can find. Also make sample bottles of benzene and isopropyl alcohol. 1. Place the isopropyl alcohol test substance on one plate and your products, in turn, on the other. 2. Listen to the current with only one of the plates in the cir- cuit. Then listen with both plat es in (the test plate switch ON). This method can detect one part per quadrillion in concentration. It is not as sensitive as the skin test (Lesson Five). 3. Repeat, with the benzene test substance. Even tiny amounts of solvents are toxic! They must not be consumed or be left in our environment."},{"pageNumber":523,"pageContent":"H OW T O T EST Y OURSELF 497 I have found that too many uns uspected products test posi- tive to benzene . This is such a global tragedy that people must protect themselves by using their own tests. Rather than assur- ances, regulatory agencies should provide the consumer with cheap and simple tests (dip sticks and papers so we need not lug our Syncrometers around). Even if some test should fail, not all tests would fail to find an important pollutant like benzene. It would come to public attention mu ch faster than the present de- bacle has. 1) Salmonella , Shigella , aflatoxin, ergot, zearalenone, patulin test sticks; 2) ozonator; 3) Lugol’s; 4) vitamin C powder; 5) sodium/ po- tassium salt; 6) fresh powdered herb spices; 7) food zapper; 8) benzene, isopropyl alcohol, wood alcohol test sticks; 9) heavy metals and lanthanides test sticks.

Materials: An aluminum measuring spoon, a tsp. of free flowing aluminized salt, a square inch of aluminum foil, a package of pork brain from the grocery store, kept frozen. (Other animal sources will do). Or a stained slide of cerebrum, cerebellum or other brain tissue. Method: 1. Cut a piece of brain tissue (about 1 tsp.) and place in a plastic bag. 2. Place the aluminum samples in separate plastic bags. Add filtered water to each, about 1 tbs. Keep all surfaces and your hands meticulously clean (do not use soap). 3. Place the aluminum sample on one plate and the brain sample on the other plate. 4. Probe for resonance. If the circuit resonates you have aluminum in your brain. 5. If your aluminum specimen actually has cadmium or cop- per in it, you are also testing for these in your brain. Re- peat the aluminum test with other aluminum objects. If they all resonate, you very, very likely have aluminum in your brain. If you can, test your self to cadmium and cop- per, separately. If you don't have these in your brain, the aluminum test result is even more likely to be correct. 6. Of course, it would be desirabl e to have absolute certainty about this. To achieve this, purchase pure aluminum or an Atomic Absorption Standard. These are available from chemical supply companies. If you do have aluminum in your brain, where is it coming from?"},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"H OW T O T EST Y OURSELF 499 7. Leave your purest aluminum test substance on one plate, and replace the brain sample with these items, testing them one at a time. Remember to rest after each positive result. • a teaspoon of cottage cheese or yogurt taken from the top of a container of a foil-capped variety • a piece of cream cheese or butter that was wrapped in foil • a chip of bar soap or a bit of hand lotion • a piece of cake or rolls baked in an aluminum pan • a piece of turkey skin or hot dish that was covered with aluminum foil • anything baked with baking powder • a carbonated beverage from an aluminum can Alternative Lesson: To test for dental metal in your tissues. Use a piece of amalgam from an old tooth filling. This tests for the rest of the alloys in amalgam fillings as well as mercury. If you can't get a piece of mercury amalgam, use a mercury thermometer (don't break it, just put the bulb on the plate). Choose tissues like kid- ney, nerves, brain, liver, in addition to white blood cells. I have never dissected human tissues and subjected them to confirmatory laboratory tests. It seems reasonable that because skin and tongue are directly prova ble, that other tissues work similarly. Testing Someone Else Seat the person comfortably with their hand resting near you. Choose the first knuckle from the middle or first finger"},{"pageNumber":526,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 500 just like you do for yourself. Since you are touching this person, you are putting yourself in the circuit with the subject. To exclude yourself, you need to add inductance to your- self. A coil of about 10 microhe nrys, worn next to the skin , works well and is easily made. Obtain insulated wire and wrap 24 turns around a ball point pen (or something about that size), closely spaced. Cut the ends and tape them down securely. Keep it in a plastic bag, even when in your pocket. A commer- cial inductance of 4.7 microhenrys, worn touching your skin also works well. It can be worn on a string necklace. (Remember to remove the necklace when testing yourself.) The inductance acts as an RF (radi o frequency) choke, limiting the alternating current that can flow through you while testing an- other person. Test your inductor in this wa y. Repeat Lesson One with the coil next to your body. No resonance, even to SALT #1, should occur. If it does, make the co il bigger. Remove the inductor when you are not testing others. Lesson Eight Purpose: To detect aluminum in the brain of another per- son. Materials: same as previous lesson, you wear the inductor. Method: 1. Place the aluminum sample on one plate and the brain sample on the other plate. 2. Give the other person the handhold. You use the probe. Hold their finger steady in yours. 3. Probe the other person for resonance. The first probe is with only one plate in the circ uit. The second is with both plates in the circuit. Resonance implies there is aluminum in the person's brain."},{"pageNumber":527,"pageContent":"H OW T O T EST Y OURSELF 501 Saliva Testing This may become your most usef ul test. The saliva has in it a bit of almost everything toxic that is in you. But it is not the first tissue to carry the HIV virus or a bit of a tapeworm stage. Nevertheless, ortho-phospho-tyrosine, Salmonella , mercury in your kidneys, aluminum in the brain all show up in the saliva, too. And saliva can be sent by mail or stored in the refrigerator. It should be frozen for long storage to prevent mold invasion. Or it may have grain alcohol added to preserve it. This test is not as sensitive as having the person present in the circuit, though. To make a saliva specimen, place a two inch square piece of white, unfragranced paper towel (tear, don't cut) in a light- weight resealable baggie. Ho ld the open baggie near your mouth. Don't touch the paper towe l with your fingers. Drool or spit onto the paper towel until half of it is damp. Zip it shut. Before testing, add enough filtered water to dampen the whole piece of paper. Lesson Nine Purpose: To search for shingles or Herpes . Materials: A saliva specimen from the person being tested; they may be thousands of miles away. Also a specimen of the virus as a test substance. This can be obtained from someone else's lesions—one droplet is enough, picked up on a bit of pa- per towel. The whole thing, towel and all, can be pushed into a glass bottle for preserving. Wate r and alcohol should be added. It can also be put on a slide, labeled Herpes, homemade . A ho- meopathic preparation of the vi rus does not give accurate re- sults for this kind of testing, due to the additional frequency imposed on it by potentizing. (However, homeopathic prepara-"},{"pageNumber":528,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 502 tions can be used if the potency matches the tissue frequency where it resides. Hopefully, some way of using homeopathic sources will soon be found.) Method: Place the saliva specimen in its unopened baggie on one plate. You may wish to open it briefly, though, to add enough filtered water to wet all the paper and add ¼ tsp. grain alcohol to sterilize or preserve it. Place the virus specimen on the ot her plate and test as usual (like Lesson Six). A positive result means the person has active Herpes . The main disadvantage of saliv a testing is that you do not know which tissue has the pathogen or the toxin. You can only conclude that it is present. Usua lly this is enough information to carry out a corrective program. Surrogate Testing Although saliva testing is so easy, it is also possible to use an adult as a surrogate when te sting a baby or pet. The pet or baby is held on the lap of the su rrogate. A large pet may sit in front of the person. The handhold is held by the surrogate and pressed firmly against the body of th e baby or pet. It can be laid flat against the arm, body or leg of a baby and held in place firmly by the whole hand of the adult. The paper covering should be wet. For a pet, the end is held firmly pressed against the skin, such as between the front legs or on the belly. The other hand of the adult is used for testing in the usual way. The adult must wear an inductor for surrogate testing as well as you, the tester. An ill or bedridden person may be tested without incon- venience or stress. He or she re sts their whole hand on the skin of your leg, just above the knee. A wet piece of paper towel, about 4 inches by 4 inches is placed on your leg, to make better"},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"H OW T O T EST Y OURSELF 503 contact. You must use an inductor for yourself with this method. You may now proceed to probe on your hand instead of the ill person's. Lesson Ten Purpose: To test for cancer. Materials: Ortho-phospho-tyrosine. Here are three ways to obtain some: 1. Order a pure sample from a chemical company (see Sources ). Place a few milligrams (it need not be weighed) in a small glass bottle, add 2 tsp. filtered water and ¼ tsp. grain alcohol. 2. All persons with cancer have ortho-phospho-tyrosine in their saliva as well as in the cancerous tissue. Obtain a sa- liva specimen from a person who has active cancer. Freeze it if you can't prepare it immediately. Keep such specimens well marked in an additional sealed plastic bag. Persons who have recently been treated clinically for can- cer are much less likely to have ortho-phospho-tyrosine in the saliva. 3. There is still another way to prepare an ortho-phospho- tyrosine test sample. Common snails from a fish tank or outdoor snails are the natural hosts for Fasciolopsis buskii (human intestinal fluke) stages. The stages will produce ortho-phospho-tyrosine when the snails are fed fish food polluted with isopropyl alcohol . Over half the fish food cans I purchased had isopropyl alcohol pollution. Buy several brands of fish food. Test them for isopropyl alco- hol and benzene. Obtain some snails, put them in a tank, feed them isopropyl alcohol polluted fish food. (Feed a separate group of snails ben zene polluted fish food to ob- tain samples of HIV.) After two days put each snail in a"},{"pageNumber":530,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 504 zipped plastic bag, and test them individually against someone diagnosed with cancer or their saliva. The snails that the person or saliva tests positive to have ortho- phospho-tyrosine. Put these snails in the freezer to kill them humanely, then crush them and place in a specimen bottle with 50% grain alcohol to preserve. The bottles can be kept sealed and at room temperature. Similarly, your benzene snails can be tested against some- one known to be HIV positive. Saliva does not show the virus in early infections. Any snails that test positive can be used to prepare an HIV test specimen in the same way. The fish food must be tested for both benzene and isopro- pyl alcohol pollution, and separated appropriately, or you run the risk of making specimens that have both ortho- phospho-tyrosine and HIV. Method: 1. Test for cancer by placing the test sample you just made (any of the three) on one plate and a white blood cell sample on the other plate. 2. If you resonate with both samples in the circuit you have cancer. Immediately, search for your cancer in your breast, prostate, skin, lungs, colon, and so forth. As you know by now, you can conf irm the cancer by testing yourself to isopropyl alcohol and the human intestinal fluke in the liver. You should eliminate isopropyl alcohol from use and zap all parasites. Keep testi ng yourself for cancer until it is gone. It should take less than one hour. Also take the herbal parasite program plus Mop Up. Continue to test yourself for isopropyl alcohol and the intestinal fluke in the white blood cells; make sure they are gone. Also test yourself for Ascaris , copper, and Freon."},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"H OW T O T EST Y OURSELF 505 Lesson Eleven Purpose: To test for HIV. Materials: Purchase a few milligrams of Protein 24 antigen (a piece of the HIV virus core) or the complete HIV virus on a slide. You may use the vial unope ned if only one test specimen is needed. To make more specimens, use about 1 milligram per ½ ounce bottle. Add 2 tsp. filtered water and ¼ tsp. grain alco- hol. Or prepare an HIV specimen fr om snails as described in the previous Lesson. Method: Search in the thymus (throat sweet breads), vagina and penis for the virus because that is where it will reside al- most exclusively for the first year or two. If you don't have those tissue specimens, you could search in urine, blood, saliva, or white blood cells, but only a positive result can be trusted. Also search for the human intes tinal fluke and benzene in the thymus. Of course, a positive test in these tissues is very sig- nificant. If you are positive, zap parasites immediately. You should test negative in less than an hour. Remove benzene pol- luted items from your lifestyle. Al so test yourself to several va- rieties of popcorn, brown rice, and corn chips as an indication of zearalenone, which must be eliminated in order to get well. Follow up on yourself every few days to be sure your new found health is continuing. Test yourself for Freon. Lesson Twelve Purpose: To test for diseases of all kinds. Materials: Use slides and cultures of disease organisms. Homemade preparations of strep throat, acute mononucleosis, thrush ( Candida ), chicken pox, Herpes 1 and 2, eczema, shin- gles, warts, measles, yeast, fungus, rashes, colds, sore throats, sinus problems, tobacco virus, and so forth can all be made by"},{"pageNumber":532,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 506 swabbing or scraping the affected part. A plastic spoon or bit of paper towel works well. Put a small bit on a slide. Add a drop of balsam and a cover slip. Or put the towel in a bottle, add water and alcohol as described previously. Microscope slides can greatly expand your test set (see Sources ). Method: Test yourself for a variet y of diseases, using your white blood cell specimen first. Then search in organs like the liver, pancreas, spleen. Notice how many of these common ill- nesses don't “go away” at all. They are alive and well in some organ. They are merely not making you sick! Lesson Thirteen To test for AIDS. Materials: Benzene sample, slides of tissue samples like thymus, liver, pancreas, penis, a nd vagina. Also a collection of disease specimens such as the ones used in the previous lesson. Method: Search in the thymus for benzene. If it is positive throughout the day, you are at risk for developing AIDS, al- though you may not be ill. Search other tissues for benzene. The more tissues with benzene in them the more serious the situation. Immediately search all your body products and foods for benzene. Stay off benzene polluted items forever. Tally up the diseases you tested positive for in Lesson Twelve. Test at least ten. If you had more than half positive you already have AIDS.

Materials: Do not try to purchase a pure sample of afla- toxin; it is one of the most potent carcinogens known. Having it on hand would constitute unnecessary hazard, even though the bottle would never need to be opened. Simply make specimens of beer, moldy bread, apple cide r vinegar, and any kind of pea- nuts using a very small amount and adding filtered water and grain alcohol as usual. Method: Test yourself for these. If you have all of them in your white blood cells and the liver then you very, very proba- bly have aflatoxin built up. Next, test your daily foods for their presence in your white blood cells. Those that test positive must be further tested for aflatoxin. Notice the effect of vitamin C on aflatoxin in your liver. Find a time when your liver is positive to aflatoxin (eat a few roasted peanuts from a health food store and wait ten minutes). Take 1 gram vitamin C in a glass of wa- ter. Check yourself for aflatoxi n every five minutes. Does it clear? If not, take 5 or 10 grams vitamin C. How long does it take? Lesson Fifteen Purpose: To test for parasites. Method: If you test positive to your pet's saliva, you have something in common–a parasite, no doubt. You must search your muscles and liver for these, not saliva or white blood cells, because they are seldom seen in these. Zap yourself for para- sites until you no longer test positive to your pets' saliva. Tapeworms and tapeworm stages can not (and should not ) be killed with a regular frequency generator.

Only zapping kills all and is safe for tapeworms. However, the zapper current does not penetrate and kill an intact cysticercus stage. You must use the Mop Up program. Be sure to treat your pet on a daily basis with the pet para- site program. Lesson Sixteen Purpose: To see how sensitive your measurements can be. (How much of a substance must be present for you to get a positive result?) Materials: filtered water, salt, glass cup measure, 13 new glass bottles that hold at leas t ¼ cup, 14 new plastic teaspoons, your skin tissue sample, paper towel. Method: Some of the best measurement systems available today are immunological (such as an ELISA assay) and can detect as little as 100 fg/ml (femtograms per milliliter). A mil- liliter is about as big as a pea, and a femtogram is 1/1,000,000,000,000,000th (10 -15 ) of a gram! 1. Rinse the glass cup measure with filtered water and put one half teaspoon of table salt in it. Fill to one cup, stir- ring with a plastic spoon. What concentration is this? A teaspoon is about 5 grams, a cup is about 230 ml (milliliters), therefore the starting concentration is about 2½ (2.5) gm per 230 ml, or .01 gm/ml (we will discuss the amount of error later). 2. Label one clean plastic spoon “water” and use it to put nine spoonfuls of filtered water in a clean glass bottle. Use another plastic spoon to tran sfer one spoonful of the .01 gm/ml salt solution in the cup measure to the glass bottle, stir, then discard the spoon. The glass bottle now"},{"pageNumber":535,"pageContent":"H OW T O T EST Y OURSELF 509 has a 1 in 10 dilution, and its concentration is one tenth the original, or .001 gm/ml. 3. Use the “water” spoon to put nine spoonfuls of filtered water in bottle #2. Use a new spoon to transfer a spoonful of salt solution from bottle #1 to bottle #2 and stir briefly (never shake). Label bottle #2 “.0001 gm/ml”. 4. Repeat with remaining bottle s. Bottle #13 would therefore be labeled “.000000000000001 gm/ml.” This is 10 -15 gm/ml, or 1 femtogram/ml. 5. Do the skin test with wate r from bottle #13 as in Lesson Five. If you can detect this , you are one hundred times as sensitive as an ELISA assay (and you should make a bot- tle #14 and continue if you are curious how good your sensitivity can get). If you can not, try to detect water from bottle #12 (ten times as sensitive as ELISA). Con- tinue until you reach a bottle you can detect. Calculate the error for your experiment by assuming you could be off by as much as 10% when measuring the salt and water adding up to 20% error in each of the 13 dilutions. This is a total error in bottle #13 of 280%, or at most a factor of 3. So bottle #13 could be anywhere fr om 0.33 to 3 femtogram/ml. If you can detect water from bottle #13, you are definitely more sensitive then an ELISA, in spite of your crude utensils and in- expensive equipment! Note that the starting error of using 2.5 gm instead of 2.3 gm only adds another 10% error. If you want to calculate how many salt molecules you can detect, select the concentrati on at the limit of your detection, and put 2 drops on a square inch of paper towel and rub into your skin. Assume one drop can be absorbed. If you can detect water from bottle #13, you have detected 510,000 molecules (10 -15 fg/ml divided by 58.5 gm/M multiplied by 6.02x10 23 molecules/M divided by 20 drops/ml). Water in bottle #12 would therefore have 10 times as many molecules in one drop,"},{"pageNumber":536,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 510 and so forth. Even if your error is as much as a factor of 2 (100%), you can still get a good idea of what you can measure. Atomic absorption standards start at exact concentrations; it is easy to make a more exact d ilution series with them. When testing for iridium chloride by this skin test method, I was able to detect 3025 molecules! Troubleshooting: Always extend your set until you get a negative result (this should happen by at least bottle #18). If you always “detect” salt, then you shook the bottle! Never try to reuse a bottle if you spill when pouring into it. Get another new bottle. Sensitivity of Pollutant-In-Product Testing Get some slides of Salmonellas and Shigellas and find some milk that tests positive to at leas t one. Make a dilution series of the milk up to bottle #14, being car eful not to shake the bottles. Start with 2 drops of milk in bottle #1. Use an eye dropper to deliver 2 drops to subsequent bottles. Begin testing at bottle #14, using the slide that tested pos itive. You will learn to search by frequency later. My sensitivity was routinely around bottle #12, for a variety of pathogens. It was the same for toxic ele- ments starting with standard solutions, about 1000 μg/ml, showing this method is less sensitive than skin testing. Lesson Seventeen Purpose: To test for fluke disease. A small number of intestinal flukes resident in the intestine may not give you any noticeable symptoms. Similarly, sheep liver flukes resident in the liver and pancreatic flukes in the pancreas may not cause noticeable symptoms. Their eggs are"},{"pageNumber":537,"pageContent":"H OW T O T EST Y OURSELF 511 shed through the organ ducts to the intestine and out with the bowel movement. They hatch and go through various stages of development outdoors and in other animals. But if you become the total host so that various stages are developing in your or- gans, you have what I term fluke disease . I have found that can- cer, HIV, diabetes, endomet riosis, Hodgkin's disease, Alzheimer's disease, lupus, MS and “universal allergy syn- drome” are examples of fluke disease. You can test for fluke disease in two ways: electronically and by microscope observation. Materials: Cultures or slides of flukes and fluke stages from a biological supply company (see Sources ) including eggs, miracidia, redia, cercaria, metacercaria. Body fluid specimens to help you locate them for observation under a microscope. Method: Test for fluke stages in your white blood cells first. If you have any fluke stages in your white blood cells you may wish to see them with your own eyes. To do this, you must first locate them. Place your body fluid samples on one plate, your parasite stages on the other plate, and test for as many as you were able to procure, besides adults. After finding a stage electronically, you stand a better chance of finding it physically with a microscope. Microscopy Lesson Purpose: To observe fluke stages in saliva and urine with a microscope.

For sanitation purposes (wiping table tops, slides, micro- scope and your hands) a 50% to 70% alcohol solution (not rubbing alcohol!) is best. Dilute 95% grain alcohol 7 parts alcohol plus 3 parts water. Vodka or 76% grain alcohol can be used undiluted. e. Formaldehyde, 20%. Formaldehyde 37% is commonly available at pharmacies. Dilute this with equal parts of filtered water to get 18½%, which is close enough to 20%, for the purpose of “fixing” (killing) the specimens.

Ask a pharmacist to prepare Lugol’s Iodine Solution for you, as follows: • 44 grams (1½ oz) iodine crystals • 88 grams (3 oz) potassium iodide crystals Dissolve both in 1 liter (quart) filtered water. This may take a day of frequent shaking. Method for saliva: 1. Pour the 20% formaldehyde into a small amber bottle or other receptacle to a depth of about 1/8 inch. Keep tightly closed. 2. The person to be tested is asked to salivate into the bottle so the organisms are immediately “fixed” without under- going cooling first. The to tal volume should be about double the original amount of formaldehyde used. Make a mark on the container so th e subject knows how much to produce. The resultant concentration of formaldehyde will be about 10%. 3. Shake the bottle a few times. Set it aside for 24 hours to settle (less if testing is urgent). 4. With a dropper, draw up some of the bottom settlings. Put one drop on a slide and apply a coverslip. 5. View under low power of microscope. Compare objects you observe with specimens obt ained on slides from bio- logical supply companies. Note: Persons with HIV and moderate AIDS will show about one to ten parasite stages per slide. It requires several hours of searching. Persons with HIV and severe AIDS show 10 or more fluke stages per slide; this makes the task of finding them much easier. Persons with terminal untreated cancer have many more fluke stages than relatively well persons."},{"pageNumber":540,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 514 Method for urine: 1. Prepare bottles of formaldehyde fixative ahead of time. Put about ¼ to ½ inch of 20% formaldehyde in each. Keep tightly closed. 2. Add freshly voided 63 urine from cancer or HIV sufferers to the formaldehyde in approximately equal amounts, re- sulting in a 10% formaldehyde solution. Shake immedi- ately. Let settle several hours. The sediment has a higher number of fluke stages. Cancer victims with cervical or prostate cancer will show higher numbers of stages in urine than other cancer types. 3. Staining the slide is optional. It helps to outline fluke stages slightly. Prepare Lugol’s solution as described above. Slides may be stained in either of these two ways: • Put a drop of “fixed” urin e on a slide. Add a drop of 50% Lugol’s (dilute 1:1 with filtered water). Apply coverslip. • Put a drop of “fixed” urine on a slide. Apply coverslip. Add 1 to 3 drops of 50% Lugol’s to edge of coverslip and allow it to seep in. Note: persons who have been treated for cancer or HIV us- ing any of the known drugs may s how only 1 to 2 fluke parasite stages per drop of saliva or urine. For this reason, you may need to search through 20 or more slides to find flukes. Very ill per- sons may show up to 10 parasites per drop (slide). Taking Pictures Of What You See You may be unsure of what you see even if you have the microscope slides of labeled flukes and their stages to study and   63 Urine that has cooled even s lightly below body temperature does not show miracidia and redia in their original shapes."},{"pageNumber":541,"pageContent":"H OW T O T EST Y OURSELF 515 compare. In real life, they vary so much in shape and size that absolute identification is diffi cult without experience. Unfortu- nately in a few hours, just as you are getting proficient, your magnificent specimens will be drying out and unfit for obser- vation. To preserve them l onger you can seal the edges by painting around the coverslip with fingernail clear enamel. Or dribble hot sealing wax along the edges and then place them in sealed plastic bags (one per bag). Melt sealing wax in a metal jar lid. Make an applicator fr om a piece of coat hanger wire bent in the shape of a small s quare to fit around the coverslip and a handle. Or take photographs. To take pictures of what you see under the microscope you will need a photomicrographic camera, which costs $200.00 and up (see Sources ). It is easy to use. Remember to label your pictures so you know which slide they came from. Even photographs do not scientifically prove identity of parasite stages, but it is very good evidence. Proof would re- quire that the saliva or urine sa mple could be cultured and seen to produce the known parasite st ages. Hopefully, this will soon be done."},{"pageNumber":543,"pageContent":" 517 The Tests It is tempting to think that the 300+ tests I use are definitive, and by getting rid of the parasites, toxins, solvents, pathogens and fungi we are guaranteed good h ealth. But there are far more of each of these than we will ev er have samples of. Fortunately, we think we know the major culp rits. If you clean these up, then you can expect most, if not all, of your symptoms to go away. I see food mold, solvent pollution, metal pollution, and parasitism as being the major threats to our health at this time. Molds prevent the liver from detoxifying solvents. Solvents in- duce parasites to invade animals and tissues that they have never gotten a foothold in be fore, causing cancer, HIV/AIDS and a number of other modern diseases. Metal lowers glu- tathione levels, and with it your immunity to these diseases. These events are totally unsuspected, with virtually no federal research dollars being spent on th em compared to the grants for viral and bacterial research. Meanwhile, our beef and poultry supplies are being quietly overrun by parasites, exposing us to new levels of hazard. Even our pets are newly parasitized and can infect us, too! Although you may think your only goal is to get the human intestinal fluke out of your liver so that ortho-phospho-tyrosine stops being produced, it is just as important to completely clean up your body. This allows you not onl y to stop the tumors from metastasizing, but to shrink and eliminate them, so that you can become completely well."},{"pageNumber":544,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 518 Cancer Although there are no true clini cal cancer tests, there are more than two dozen markers. 64 Each can identify a particular cancer with reasonable accuracy. Recently, ortho-phospho- tyrosine has been found to be reliable for many kinds of human malignancies. The ortho-phospho-tyrosine sa mple was prepared by dis- solving several milligrams in 10 ml filtered water and kept permanently sealed in a ½ ounce amber glass bottle. The hCG sample was similarly prepared. HIV There are a variety of antibody tests used clinically, which detect whether you have made an tibodies to the HIV virus. Ob- viously, you must have had the viru s at some time in the past in order to make the antibodies. And since nobody ever gets rid of the virus once they have it (unless they de-parasitize), it is a perfectly adequate diagnostic test. But if you kill the intestinal fluke and its stages, thereby eliminating the virus, you do not stop making the antibodies. For this reason another type of c linical test is needed. Protein 24 (P24) antigen is an actual pi ece of the HIV virus itself. The P24 test, therefore is testing for the actual virus, not antibodies to it. It is like taking a small piece of elephant skin to the zoo to search for elephants. I selected th e clinical P24 test to clinically prove the absence of the HIV virus, because the antibody test would remain positive even after the HIV virus is gone.   64 Stewart Sell, MD, Diagnostic Uses of Cancer Markers , The Female Patient, Vol. 9, August 1984."},{"pageNumber":545,"pageContent":"T HE T ESTS 519 Another clinical test, PCR- HIV1-RNA (quantitative) also tests for the presence of virus itself. It seeks out the nucleic acid that is specific for the virus. Bear in mind, however, that both the P24 test and PCR tests are still chemical in nature, and are affected by factors which may allow false results to occur. The laboratory test method, of course, tries to take this into account. My electronic test uses the same P24 antigen, one half mil- ligram dissolved in 3 ml filtered water permanently sealed in a ½ ounce amber glass bottle. I have also used a slide with lung tissue infected with HIV and got identical results. Parasites I test for about 120 different parasites or stages of parasites. (They are divided into Box 1 and Box 2 which you may see re- ferred to in the case histories.) Below is a list of the parasites. They are on slides purchased from biological supply companies. Some are cultures in small vials. Most of them are whole mounts of the adult stage. Some are slides of eggs and other stages. They are searched for in the white blood cells. This means that encysted forms such as tapeworm cysticercus and Toxoplasma cysts are missed because the immune system is not attacking them. They have to be searched for separately in the tissue suspected (muscles, eyes, etc.). The importance of testing for a list of parasites is not to cure cancer. Fasciolopsis buskii , the human intestinal fluke, has al- ready been identified in my res earch as the critical cancer para- site. It is the remainder, however, that are undoubtedly contributing to your inability to regain your health.

The concept is that if some- thing is found in the white blood cells, it must be harmful to your body or at least useless. Even if the substance isn't harm- ful, if it preoccupies your immune system, it is a handicap to your body. Some of the test items, like aluminum silicate, are com- pounds, not simply elements. Si nce there are thousands upon thousands of toxic chemicals in our environment and there would be no way of testing them all, my system of using the elements instead of the compounds is a short cut. For this rea- son, the test is far from perfect . For example, a person may test positive to aluminum silicate but show no aluminum in the white blood cells. So, if I had te sted only for aluminum, I would have missed the problem. Sometimes, toxic elements are present in an organ, but are not present in the white blood cells. For example, there may be mercury stored in the pancreas, but not be showing in the white blood cells at the time I'm testing. I interpret this as reflecting low levels of the toxin. Ideally, a test would search all your or- gans, but this would be too time-consuming for my technology. Most of the toxic elements are metals, heavy metals and lanthanides. But some are not; examples are PCBs and formal- dehyde. Some important elements are missing, like iron, zinc and manganese. This is because I never could find them present in the white blood cells, and I finally gave up searching for them. The most important thing to do after finding the toxic ele- ment in your body is to track down the source of it in your en- vironment. Is it in food, air, drugs, vitamins?

They get deposited in the tiny tubules that make up the kidney, partly blocking the flow of liquid. This leads to “water holding” in your tissues. As more crystals are formed, they be- gin to deposit in other organs, t oo, such as joints of feet and hands and the interior of arte ries, causing hardening. The usual"},{"pageNumber":558,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 532 symptoms are low back pain, pain running down the leg, foot pain, hand pain and gout. Oxalic acid crystals cause pain in the lower back. Uric acid causes pain in the toes. The phosphates cause pain in the other joints (arthritis). But crystals do not cause pain by themselves. Bacteria find these nutritious deposits, and ultimately, it is they and their refuse that cause pain. By causing partial blockage, these deposits prevent heavy metals from passing out through the kidneys. Mercury and nickel from tooth fillings are c onstantly being excreted through the kidney tubules. But as the kidneys get older and the deluge of toxic compounds gets higher, the toxins just attach them- selves to the deposits already th ere. Soon, a pile-up of toxins occurs in the kidney. The treatment is the same for all persons. It is a combination of herbs and nutritional substances, which, together, can dissolve all the 7 kinds of stones. The recipe is quite long (see Kidney Cleanse, page 596). The reas on for this is so the indi- vidual kinds of stones don't have to be dissolved separately. This recipe dissolves all the stones in three weeks. Notice that some very sick or elderly people are told to take half a dose only. Persons with a history of kidney stones, who know they have large stones, are also told to drink half a dose daily. Persons with sensitive stomachs may not tolerate these herbs; they could try killing their parasites first. It is fair to say that we all develop kidney stones; although they may remain very tiny and cause no pain.

No need to single out specific frequencies or to sweep through a range of frequencies one kHz at a time. No matter what frequency it is set at (within reason), it kills large and small invaders: flukes, roundworms, mites, bacteria, viruses and fungi. It k ills them all at once, in 7 min- utes, even at 5 volts. How does it work? I suppose that a positive voltage applied anywhere on the body attracts negativ ely charged things such as bacteria. Perhaps the battery volta ge tugs at them, pulling them out of their locations in the cell doorways (called conductance channels ). But doorways can be negatively charged too. Does the voltage tug at them so they disgorge any bacteria stuck in them? How would the positive volta ge act to kill a large para- site like a fluke? None of these questions can be answered yet. Other fascinating possibilities are that the intermittent posi- tive voltage interferes with elect ron flow in some key metabolic route, or straightens out th e ATP molecule disallowing its breakdown. Such biological ques tions could be answered by studying the effects of positive frequencies on bacteria in a lab. The most important question, of course, is whether there is a harmful effect on you. I have seen no effects on blood pressure, mental alertness, or body temperatures. It has never produced pain, although it has often stopped pain instantly. This does not prove its safety. Even knowing th at the voltage comes from a small 9 volt battery does not prove safety, although it is reassuring. The clotting of red bl ood cells, platelet aggregation and functions that depend on surf ace charges on cells need to be investigated. But not before you can use it. Your safety lies in the short period of exposure that is necessary.

One need not go beyond this time, although no bad effects have been seen at any length of treatment. The first seven minute zapping is followed by an intermis- sion, lasting 20 to 30 minutes. Du ring this time, bacteria and viruses are released from the dyi ng parasites and start to invade you instead. The second seven minute session is intended to kill these newly released viruses and b acteria. If you omit it, you could catch a cold, sore throat or something else immediately. Again, viruses are released from the dying bacteria. The third session kills the last viruses released. Do Not Zap If You Are Pregnant Or Wearing A Pacemaker. These situations have not been explored yet. Don't do these experiments yourself. Children as young as 8 months have been zapped with no noticeable ill effects. For them, you should weigh the possible benefits against the unknown risks. That is all there is to it. Almost all. The zapping current does not reach deep into the eyeb all or testicle or bowel con- tents. It does not reach into your gallstones, or into your living cells where Herpes virus lies latent or Candida fungus extends its fingers. To reach deeper, the herbal parasite program (page 19) must be added to the zapper treatment."},{"pageNumber":563,"pageContent":"B UILDING A Z APPER 537 Killing The Surviving Pathogens The interior of gallstones may house parasites inaccessible to the zapping. Eliminate this source of reinfection by flushing them out with liver cleanses (page 599). Use ozonated oil in the Liver Cleanse for greater effectiveness. Although the center of the bowel contents is often unaf- fected, which lets bowel bacteria like Shigella , Escherichia coli (E. coli) and parasite stages survive, sometimes it is nearly all sterilized by zapping. This results in considerable shrinkage of the bowel movement. Eliminate remaining parasites and bacte- ria with a single dose (2 tsp.) of Black Walnut Hull Tincture, Extra Strength. The zapper current travels mainly along the intestinal wall where bacteria are scurrying to cross over into your body. Even “good” bacteria are no longer good when they are crossing the wall. So zapping kills mostly “bad” bacteria. The good news is that perfect bowel habits often result in a few days. Evidently, the good bacteria are benefited by killing the invasive ones. Homemade yogurt and buttermilk (see Recipes ) are especially good at recolonizing the bowel. Bu t it does not seem wise to culture yourself with special co mmercial preparations which are often polluted and risk getting parasite stages again when you can become normal so soon anyway. Besides, acidophilus bac- teria are able to change RNA into DNA and are often found in a growing tumor! When a large number of parasites, bacteria and viruses are killed, it can leave you fatigued. Try to give yourself a low- stress day after your initial zappi ng. But there are no significant side effects.

Connect the mi nus end of the LED to the grounding bolt using an alligator clip. 7. Connect pin number 1 on the chip to the grounding bolt with an alligator clip. 8. Attach an alligator clip to the outside of one of the bolts. Attach the other end to a handhold (copper pipe). Do the same for the other bolt and handhold. 9. Connect the minus end of th e battery (black wire) to the grounding bolt with an alligator clip. 10. Connect the plus end of the battery (red wire) to the free end of the switch using a micr oclip lead. If the LED lights up you know the switch is ON. If it does not, flip the switch and see if the LED lights. Label the switch clearly. If you cannot get the LED to light in either switch position, you must double-check all of your connections, and make sure you have a fresh battery. 11.

Consume 1 cup a day in table- spoon amounts that you add to soup, stew, pudding, pie, or bouillon. Bring 2 tsp. sodium alginate powder and 1 pint water to a boil. Stir with wooden spoon handl e. Use slow heat – it could take an hour. Add to soup, st ew, moose elm beverage, pudding or pie. Consume one to two cups per day.

A higher pro- portion of potassium chloride should be approved by your health adviser who will check your blood levels. Another wise rule is to use salt either in cooking or at the table, but not both places. This cuts down on the total consumed.

You don't need all those products you see in commer- cials for each special task! Even if you have dry skin, difficult hair or some other unique requirement, just pure borax will satisfy these needs. A part of every skin problem is due to the toxic elements found in the soaps themselves. For instance aluminum is commonly added as a “skin moisturizer”. It does this by impregnating the skin and attracting water, givi ng the illusion of moist skin. In fact you simply have moist aluminum stuck in your skin which your immune system must remove. While borax won't directly heal your skin or complexion, it does replace the agents that are causing damage, so that healing can occur.

Borax inhibits the bacterial enzyme urease and is therefore antibacterial. It may even clear your skin of blemishes and stop your scalp from itching. For Laundry Borax (½ cup per load). It is the main ingredient of non- chlorine bleach and has excellent cleaning power without fad- ing colors. It can be combined with homemade soap for extra cleaning power. Your regular la undry soap may contain PCBs, aluminum, cobalt and other chemicals. These get rubbed into your skin constantly as you wear your clothing. For bleaching (only do this occasionally) use original chlorine bleach (not “new improved” or “with special brighteners”, and so forth). Don’t use chlorine if there is an ill person in the house. For get- ting out stubborn dirt at collars, rub in homemade bar soap first; for stains, try grain alcohol, vi negar, baking soda (check old recipe books for stain removal tricks). For Dishes Don't believe your eyes when you see the commercials where the smiling person pulls a shining dish out of greasy suds. Any dish soap that you us e should be safe enough to eat because nothing rinses off clean. Regular dish detergents, in- cluding health brands , are now polluted with PCBs.

Floss and brush only once a day because even this small trauma invites bacteria and fungus into your blood. If this leaves you uncomfortable, you may use a water pick or simply rub your teeth by hand with a dr y cloth towel (paper towels have mercury contamination). Make sure that nothing solid, like powder, is on your toothbrush; it will scour and scratch the enamel. Salt is corrosive—don't use it for brushing metal teeth. Plain water is just as good. Baking soda is no longer recommended (unless ordered from Sources ) because it was found to be polluted with ben- zene.

It is stronger than th e concentrate made with just a few black walnuts in a quart jar (my earlier recipe), because there are more walnuts per un it liquid. In addition, you will not dilute it before use (although when you take it, it will usually be in water). When preparing the walnuts, ri nse only with cold tap water.

Simply refrigerating them does not keep them from turning black and useless. The pot of soaking wal- nuts should not be refrigerated. Nor does the final tincture need refrigeration until after it is opened. Exposure to air does cause the tincture to darken and lose potency.

Th ey can not be killed by zapping, because the high frequency current does not penetrate the bowel contents. Although most bowel bacteria are beneficial, the ones that are not, like Salmonellas , Shigellas , and Clostridiums are ex- tremely detrimental because they have the ability to invade the rest of your body and colonize a tr auma site or tumorous organ. These same bacteria colonize a cancer tumor and prevent shrinking after the malignancy is stopped. One reason bowel bacteria are so hard to eradicate is that we are constantly reinfecting ourselves by keeping a reservoir on our hands and under our fingernails. • So the first thing to do is improve sanitation . Use 50% grain alcohol in a spray bottle at the bathroom sink. Ster- ilize your hands after bathroom use and before meals. • Second, use betaine hydrochloride to kill Clostridium (2 tablets 3 times a day). • Third, use turmeric (2 capsules 3 times a day, this is the common spice) which I find helps against Shigella , as well as E. coli . Expect orange colored stool. • Fourth, use fennel (2 capsule 3 times a day). • Fifth, use digestive enzyme tablets with meals as di- rected on the bottle. (But onl y as long as necessary, be- cause these frequently harbor molds.) • Sixth, use a single 2 tsp. dose of Black Walnut Hull Tincture Extra Strength .

Liver Cleanse Cleansing the liver of gallstones dramatically improves di- gestion, which is the basis of your whole health. You can ex- pect your allergies to disappear, too, more with each cleanse you do! Incredibly, it also eliminates shoulder, upper arm, and upper back pain. You have more energy and increased sense of well being."},{"pageNumber":626,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 600 Cleaning the liver bile ducts is the most powerful procedure that you can do to improve your body's health. But it should not be done before the parasite program, and for best results should follow the kidney cleanse. It is the job of the liver to make bile, 1 to 1½ quarts in a day! The liver is full of tubes ( biliary tubing ) that deliver the bile to one large tube (the common bile duct ). The gallbladder is attached to the common bile duct and acts as a storage reser- voir. Eating fat or protein triggers the gallbladder to squeeze itself empty after about twenty mi nutes, and the stored bile fin- ishes its trip down the common bile duct to the intestine. For many persons, including children, the biliary tubing is choked with gallstones . Some develop allergies or hives but some have no symptoms. When the gallbladder is scanned or X- rayed nothing is seen. Typically, th ey are not in the gallbladder. Not only that, most are too sma ll and not calcified, a prerequi- site for visibility on X-ray. There are over half a dozen varieties of gallstones, most of which have cholesterol crystals in them. They can be black, red, white, green or tan colored. The green ones get their color from being co ated with bile. Notice in the picture how many have imbedded unidentified objects. Are they fluke remains? Notice how many are shaped like corks with longitudinal grooves below the tops. We can visualize the blocked bile ducts from such shapes. Other stones are compos- ites–made of many smaller ones–showing that they regrouped in the bile ducts some time after the last cleanse. At the very center of each st one is found a clump of bacte- ria, according to scientists, suggesting a dead bit of parasite might have started the stone forming."},{"pageNumber":627,"pageContent":"R ECIPES 601 As the stones grow and become more numerous the back pressure on the liver causes it to make less bile. It is also thought to slow the flow of ly mphatic fluid. Imagine the situa- tion if your garden hose had ma rbles in it. Much less water would flow, which in turn w ould decrease the ability of the hose to squirt out the marbles. With gallstones, much less cho- lesterol leaves the body, and cholesterol levels may rise. Gallstones, being porous, can pick up all the bacteria, cysts, viruses and parasites that are passing through the liver. In this way “nests” of infection are formed, forever supplying the body with fresh bacteria and parasite stages. No stomach infection such as ulcers or intestinal bloating can be cured permanently without removing these gallstones from the liver. For best results, ozonate the olive oil in this recipe to kill any parasite stages that may be released during the cleanse.

Preparation. • You can't clean a liver with living parasites in it. You won't get many stones, and you will feel quite sick. Zap daily the week before, or ge t through the first three weeks of the parasite killing program before attempting a liver cleanse. If you are on the maintenance parasite program, you are always ready to do the cleanse. • Completing the kidney cleanse before cleansing the liver is also highly recommended . You want your kidneys, bladder and urinary tract in top working condition so they can efficiently remove any undesirable substances inci- dentally absorbed from the intestine as the bile is being excreted. Ingredients Epsom salts 4 tablespoons Olive oil half cup (light olive oil is easier to get down), and for best results, ozonate it for 20 to 30 minutes, first Fresh pink grapefruit 1 large or 2 small, enough to squeeze 2/3 to 3/4 cup juice Ornithine 4 to 8, to be sure you can sleep.

Stop the parasite program and kidney herbs, too, the day before. Eat a no-fat breakfast and lunch such as cooked cereal, fruit, fruit juice, bread and preserve s or honey (no butter or milk). This allows the bile to build up and develop pressure in the liver. Higher pressure pushes out more stones. 2:00 PM. Do not eat or drink after 2 o'clock . If you break this rule you could feel quite ill later. Get your Epsom salts ready. Mix 4 tbs. in 3 cups water and pour this into a jar. This makes four servings, ¾ cup each. Set the jar in the refrigerator to get ice cold (this is for convenience and taste only). 6:00 PM. Drink one serving (¾ cup) of the ice cold Epsom salts. If you did not prepare this ahead of time, mix 1 tbs. in ¾ cup water now. You may add 1/8 tsp. vitamin C powder to im- prove the taste. You may also drink a few mouthfuls of water afterwards or rinse your mouth. Get the olive oil (ozonated, if possible) and grapefruit out to warm up. 8:00 PM.

Take it to your bed- side if you want, but drink it standing up. Get it down within 5 minutes (fifteen minutes for very elderly or weak persons). Lie down immediately. You might fail to get stones out if you don't. The sooner you lie down the more stones you will get out. Be ready for bed ahead of time. Don't clean up the kitchen. As soon as the drink is down walk to your bed and lie down flat on your back with your head up hi gh on the pillow. Try to think about what is happening in the liver. Try to keep perfectly still for at least 20 minutes. You may feel a train of stones traveling along the bile ducts like marbles. There is no pain because the bile duct valves are open (thank you Epsom salts!). Go to sleep , you may fail to get stones out if you don't. Next morning. Upon awakening take your third dose of Epsom salts. If you have indigestion or nausea wait until it is gone before drinking the Epsom salts. You may go back to bed.

Half an hour later eat fruit. One hour later you may eat regular food but keep it light. By supper you should feel recovered. How well did you do? Expect diarrhea in the morning. Use a flashlight to look for gallstone s in the toilet with the bowel movement. Look for the green kind since this is proof that they are genuine gallstones, not food residue.

The first cleanse may rid you of them for a few days, but as the stones from the rear travel for- ward, they give you the same sy mptoms again. You may repeat cleanses at two week intervals. Never cleanse when you are ill. Sometimes the bile ducts are full of cholesterol crystals that did not form into round stones. Th ey appear as a “chaff” float- ing on top of the toilet bowl water. It may be tan colored, har- boring millions of tiny white crystals. Cleansing this chaff is just as important as purging stones. How safe is the liver cleanse? It is very safe. My opinion is based on over 500 cases, including many persons in their sev- enties and eighties. None went to the hospital; none even re- ported pain. However it can make you feel quite ill for one or two days afterwards, although in every one of these cases the maintenance parasite program had been neglected. This is why the instructions direct you to complete the parasite and kidney cleanse programs first. CONGRATULATIONS You have taken out your gallstones without surgery ! I like to think I have perfected this r ecipe, but I certainly can not take credit for its origin. It was inve nted hundreds, if not thousands, of years ago, THANK YOU, HERBALISTS! This procedure contradicts many modern medical view- points. Gallstones are thought to be formed in the gallbladder, not the liver. They are thought to be few, not thousands. They are not linked to pains other than gallbladder attacks. It is easy to understand why this is thought: by the time you have acute pain attacks, some stones are in the gallbladder, are big enough and sufficiently calcified to see on X-ray, and have caused in-"},{"pageNumber":632,"pageContent":"T HE C URE F OR A LL C ANCERS 606 flammation there. When the gallbladder is removed the acute attacks are gone, but the bursitis and other pains and digestive problems remain. The truth is self-evident. People who have had their gall- bladder surgically removed still get plenty of green, bile-coated stones, and anyone who cares to dissect their stones can see that the concentric circles and crystals of cholesterol match textbook pictures of “gallstones” exactly. Lugol’s Iodine Solution It is too dangerous to buy a commercially prepared solution. It is certain to be polluted w ith isopropyl alcohol or wood alco- hol. Make it yourself or ask your pharmacist to make (not or- der) it for you. The recipe to make 1 liter (quart) is: 44 gm (1½ ounces) iodine, granular 88 gm (3 ounces) potassium iodide, granular Dissolve the potassium iodide in about a pint of the water. Then add the iodine crystals and wait till it is all dissolved. This could take a few hours with frequent shaking. Fill to the liter mark (quart) with water. Keep out of sight and reach of chil- dren. Do not use if allergic to iodine. Be careful to avoid bottled water for preparation. White Iodine 88 gm potassium iodide, granular Add potassium iodide to one qua rt or one liter cold tap wa- ter. Potassium iodide dissolves well in water and stays clear; for this reason it is called “white iodine.” Label clearly and keep out of reach of children. Do not use if allergic to iodine.

And just try to get a copy of your medical records; your doctor will instead insist on mailing them to your next doctor (because you might misinter- pret them). The story is the same for blood, urine and hormone tests. Lay people can understand a great deal of this informa- tion, and learn even more on thei r own, if they were only en- couraged instead of prohibited. Because Self Health, by its very concept, undermines the existence of the medical profe ssion as we know it, those es- pousing Self Health, hopefully soon to be the majority of per- sons, need to be protected fr om the legal wrath of medical institutions as they try to retain total control."},{"pageNumber":647,"pageContent":" 621 Index A acetone, 124, 389, 445 acetylcholine, 123 acidophilus, 172,
