You know it. You feel it. I empathize. My brain was once broken too. In The UltraMind Solution , I tell the story of how my brain broke one beautiful late-summer afternoon and how that was the beginning of my journey toward a whole new way of understanding medicine and the human body and mind. By learning how to renew my own broken brain and by working with hundreds of patients over the years with similar problems, the surprising truth I realized is that the source of broken brains is in a place most people (including doctors) never look. Broken brains don’t start in the brain. They start in the body. Renew your body, and you renew your brain. To achieve optimal health, your body needs to be balanced in the seven keys to UltraWellness. Balance in these seven key systems in your body, help your broken brain fix itself. This is the revolutionary truth that is the foundation of the The UltraMind Solution. The UltraMind Solution is a six-week, step-by-step program designed to help you identify where your body is not functioning optimally and address those areas by optimizing nutrition, balancing your hormones, supporting immune function, renewing your gut function, detoxifying, increasing your energy metabolism, and balancing the mind-body connection. The heart of the plan is a comprehensive diet and lifestyle change that consists of four basic components: 1. A healthy eating plan designed to help you optimize your brain 2. Basic supplements you need to take to maintain balance and enhance your brain chemistry 3. Lifestyle changes, including exercise, relaxation, sleep, and “brain” or mental exercises 4. Living clean and green to reduce your exposure to environmental toxins and to support a sustain - able future for us all In the book, I gave you specific instructions on how to integrate each of these changes into your life so you could optimize the seven keys to UltraWellness and achieve an UltraMind. However, when you are writing a book, there are always pieces that have to be cut. As I was writing The UltraMind Solution , I had to leave out many tips, tools, and techniques I have created and compiled over the years to make this program simpler and more effective. I believe it’s important to give clear instructions on how to achieve an UltraMind. I also believe that more detail and guidance are necessary than what can be provided in one book. That is why I wrote this companion guide. In it you will find all the tools I couldn’t fit in the book, including: ✣ Menus, recipes, shopping lists, and a daily eating program that will make sticking to the program much easier ✣ Tools to track changes in your health—your brain, your body, and your mood"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"3 Introduction ✣ A step-by-step protocol that will help you overcome any withdrawal symptoms from sugar, pro - cessed foods, or food allergens that you may experience on the program ✣ Instructions on how to optimize your aerobic conditioning (and how you can spend less time exercising but get better results) ✣ A supplement tracking worksheet that will make taking the basic supplements included in The UltraMind Solution (and even the additional ones you may need to balance the keys) extremely easy ✣ More ways to find and hit your pause button so you can relax even more deeply ✣ A food reintroduction journal designed to help you identify food sensitivities ✣ Further testing and treatment options you can pursue with your doctor to help you optimize your mental and physical health even more ✣ And many other tips for making your journey to an UltraMind easier and more enjoyable In this guide I have also provided all the quizzes, charts, and worksheets in the book so that you can print them out and use them at your convenience. Some people don’t like writing in their books. Others may want (or need) to take the quizzes more than once. Still more may want to extend their experience on the six-week plan. Having these worksheets in a handy, easily printable form accommodates everyone. My wish for you is nothing less than a life full of vital energy and happiness where your mind is sharp, focused, clear, calm, and at peace. This is one of the most important pieces of the experience of UltraWell - ness. To help you achieve that and experience what Functional Medicine can do for your body and brain from the ground up, I invite each of you to explore with our team at The UltraWellness Center in Lenox, MA. Please see our website for more information ( www.ultrawellnesscenter.com ) or call us at (413) 637-9991. Physician visits must be done in person. Nutrition consultations can be done by phone. We also offer two discounted special, month-long healing programs: Achieving UltraWellness and Achieving an UltraMind . These can be done in person or through phone consultations. In the meantime, I hope (and believe) The UltraMind Solution and this companion guide will give you the tools you need to help you achieve UltraWellness. Wishing you all endless health and happiness!

By doing this, you can customize the program by adding the suggestions I provide in Part IV of the book and achieve optimal health. For your convenience, I have reprinted each of these quizzes below 1 . They are divided by key to keep everything in order. Feel free to print them and use them as you need. Remember, each quiz offers three options to help your broken brain fix itself so you can optimize your health. These are: You will notice that for each quiz there is a “Before” and “After” column and that I have included a chart for you to keep track of your scores and improvement. You will almost surely start feeling (and seeing) a difference within a few weeks of starting The Ultra - Mind Solution. But having a quantitative assessment of the total change you make over the course of the program will help drive home how much influence the foods you eat and the lifestyle you live have on your health and your mind. As mentioned above, it is critical that you take the quizzes after the six-week program is over if your score indicates Medical Care. However, I strongly encourage you to take the quizzes both before and after the program, even if you don’t score in the Medical Care range. It will give you a clearer sense of just how much better your life has become, which is my wish for you all. 1 Note that in some cases minor textual edits have been made to these quizzes. This does not affect their efficacy in terms of determining which keys you need to optimize nor does it alter the scoring of the quizzes. ✣ The UltraMind Solution: • If your score qualifies you for The UltraMind Solution , simply follow the basic plan in Part III of the book. ✣ Self Care: • If your score qualifies you for Self Care , integrate the additional suggestions in Part IV of the book into your six-week plan. ✣ Medical Care: • If your score qualifies you for Medical Care , follow The UltraMind Solution and the additional recommendations for Self Care for six weeks, and then retake the quizzes. At that point, many of you will no longer qualify for Medical Care. If you still do, I recom - mend that you seek out a practitioner of Functional or Integrative Medicine to request the necessary tests and treatments outlined in Part IV of the book and Section 10 of this companion guide."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"5 The UltraMind Quizzes ————— Key #1: Optimize Nutrition ————— FAT T Y A C I D S Q U I Z Does your oil need to be changed?

Learning how to avoid pitfalls and common challenges while on the program; preparing your kitchen by purchasing the tools you need and stocking your shelves with whole foods; learning how to read labels on food items; and building a relationship with your food and your kitchen that is based on fun and enjoyment rather than the dreary chore it has become for so many are all critical parts of the UltraWellness lifestyle. In this section, I will review ways to achieve these goals so you can set the stage for success and develop an UltraMind. The first step is to build your UltraKitchen. ————— Creating Your Own UltraKitchen ————— If you were climbing a mountain or planning a trek into unknown territory, you would make sure you had the right clothing and tools. You would study the map before you set out. The journey of self-discovery, the journey that will take you to an UltraMind, requires some preparation and equipment. Some special tools and instructions will make your journey successful. Let’s start with your kitchen. Getting the basic equipment makes food preparation easier and faster, as will learning what to clean from your pantry and what to stock your shelves with. Arm Yourself with the Proper Tools Consider this equipment a tool kit for taking care of your body. You can substitute or make do with other tools if need be, but I would strongly recommend that you consider purchasing the following items if you don’t already have them. I would also recommend that you buy the best-quality tools possible as you build your kitchen. If you were climbing a mountain, you would buy boots that would last for the duration. The items in this list are as vital to your health as an excellent pair of boots would be if you were to go mountain climbing. These tools can last you a lifetime if you start with quality items and take proper care of them. I consider the following to be the basic essential hardware for the care and feeding of a human being (or at least the feeding!):"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"35 Set the Stage for Success Rid Your Kitchen of “Toxic” Foods Before you purchase the food you will eat on the program, take an afternoon to cleanse your cabinets of the items that do not enhance your health. This includes eliminating toxic fats and sugars from your cabinets so that you won’t “accidentally” add them to a recipe. Start by throwing into the trash all items containing hydrogenated and partially hydrogenated fats and high-fructose corn syrup. Those two changes alone can radically alter your life by enhancing your metabo - lism. Reading the labels (see more on how to do this below) on each of the food products in your cabinets and refrigerator will tell you which ones contain these ingredients. Tips and Tricks Over the years, working with the best nutritionist in the country, Kathie Swift, MS, RD, I have accumu - lated some tips and tricks to eat well and feel well. I offer them to you here.

If you carefully read the labels of the foods you buy (see below), in time you will develop a sense for which products optimize your health. Local food co-ops or national chains such as Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s, and Wild Oats have many excel - lent products that fit into The UltraMind Solution. Be proactive and urge your supermarket chain to carry these types of products. Buy foods that have not been or are only minimally processed. I recommend choosing organic foods whenever possible to reduce exposure to pesticides and increase your intake of vitamins, minerals, antioxi - dants, and phytonutrients. Choose Organic and Hormone- and Antibiotic-Free Food Buy antibiotic- and hormone-free animal products, including dairy products, poultry, and red meat, whenever possible. Avoid eating types of fish that contain high levels of mercury, such as swordfish, tilefish, shark, king mackerel, and fresh tuna (canned tuna, especially chunk light, is lower in mercury). I recommend that you eat fish with the least mercury, including blue crab (mid-Atlantic), flounder, sole, wild salmon, sar - dines, herring, anchovies, and shrimp. Check periodic updates on seafood safety at www.ewg.org and www. oceansalive.com . Buy a variety of seasonally fresh, locally grown, and, whenever possible, certified-organic produce. Though organic food is generally more expensive, the benefits are worth it. Organic food contains lower levels of pesticides, hormones, and antibiotics found in conventional foods. Research indicates that organic foods also have more nutrients than foods grown conventionally. The following is a priority list for purchasing organic produce based on data from the Environmental Working Group ( www.ewg.org ), in order of priority: ✣ Peaches ✣ Apples ✣ Sweet bell peppers ✣ Celery ✣ Nectarines ✣ Strawberries ✣ Cherries ✣ Lettuce ✣ Grapes ✣ Pears ✣ Spinach ✣ Potatoes ✣ Carrots ✣ Green beans ✣ Hot peppers ✣ Cucumbers ✣ Raspberries ✣ Plums ✣ Oranges ✣ Cauliflower Some nonorganically grown items in your local grocery store contain less pesticides and are good to eat. If you can’t completely stick to organically grown produce (either because your grocery store doesn’t carry it or because the cost is prohibitive), the following 11 items are generally considered to have the least pesticides. While I encourage you to buy as much organic produce as you can, if you can’t, these are the items I would recommend. They are listed from the lowest to the highest pesticide count."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"37 Set the Stage for Success ✣ Onions ✣ Avocado ✣ Sweet corn (frozen) ✣ Pineapple ✣ Mango ✣ Sweet peas (frozen) ✣ Asparagus ✣ Kiwi ✣ Bananas ✣ Cabbage ✣ Broccoli ✣ Eggplant ✣ Papaya ✣ Blueberries ✣ Watermelon ✣ Sweet potatoes Check out the Environmental Working Group Web site ( www.ewg.org ) for further updates. You can also reduce your exposure to pesticides and bacteria by washing your produce well. Prepare a vegetable wash solution by adding one teaspoon of mild soap or one tablespoon of cider vinegar to one gal - lon of water. Wash your vegetables in this solution and rinse well. Use a vegetable brush on potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots, or other hard produce whose skin you plan to eat. Seek Out These Antioxidant Powerhouses Scientists continue to learn more about measuring antioxidants in foods, a process referred to as ORAC (oxygen radical absorbance capacity), or the ability of the food to soak up harmful free-radical molecules (in a test tube). Be aware that with ongoing research, ORAC values may change and new foods may be added or change place on the list. In the meantime, have fun with this top 20 list of antioxidant foods. Be sure to include plenty of these on your shopping lists. How many of these foods do you like?

Gala apples"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"38 Set the Stage for Success ————— Reading Labels: If You Really Have to Buy Something Processed ————— Organic whole foods are now available in packages, cans, and boxes. They tend to be found in whole- foods stores or the health-food section of your grocery store. Even if food has ingredients you are familiar with, there are times when you may want to avoid certain products in processed or manufactured foods. For example, you will want to be careful not to inadvertently include foods in your diet that aren’t allowed on the UltraMind program, and you will want to make sure to avoid foods you haven’t officially reintegrated into your diet using the system outlined in Chapter 20 of The UltraMind Solution. Be sure to read food labels carefully as you shop for the ingredients you will use while on the program. This will help you make sure to adhere to all the guidelines of The UltraMind Solution as closely as possible. Be a smart label reader. Labels contain both the ingredients and specific (but not all) nutrition information. Here are some things of which to be aware. ✣ Beware of marketing. Remember, the front of the label is food marketing at its cleverest. It is designed to seduce you into an emotional purchase and may contain exaggerated claims. Look for high-quality ingredients. ✣ Where is the ingredient on the list? If the real food is at the end of the list and the sugars or salts are at the beginning, beware. The most abundant ingredient is listed first, and then the others are listed in descending order by weight. ✣ Beware of ingredients in foods that are not labeled. Foods that are exempt from labels include foods in very small packages, foods prepared in the store, and foods made by small manu - facturers. ✣ Look for additives or problem ingredients. If a food has high-fructose corn syrup or hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils, put it back on the shelf. Search for any “suspect” additives. ✣ Look for ingredients that don’t agree with you. Identify food ingredients you are sensitive to or react to, such as gluten, eggs, dairy, tree nuts, or peanuts. Be vigilant about reading labels, as the ingredients mentioned in the previous sentence are often hidden in foods you least suspect. The labeling of some allergens is not always clear. The Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 requires food manufacturers to disclose the eight most-common aller - gens on the labels of packaged food. (See www.celiac.com for lists of gluten-containing foods.) ✣ Investigate unfamiliar ingredients. Use an Internet search engine or other resource to find a credible source for any unfamiliar ingredients on the label before you buy, such as carmine, Quorn, or diacylglycerol. Credible Internet sources tend to be on government or educational sites ending in “.gov” or “.edu” rather than “.com.” ✣ Discover if any “functional food ingredients” are being added to the food product, such as live active cultures, beta-glucan (a viscous fiber), or plant sterols. Though they may be helpful, more often than not they are “window dressing,” present in small amounts and with minimal value, except to the marketing department of the manufacturer. Examples of this in - clude live active cultures added to high-sugar, high-fat yogurts, or vitamins; “vitamin enriched”"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"39 Set the Stage for Success yet sugar-laden cereals; and ginkgo-supplemented potato chips. In other words, it’s best to get healthful, functional food ingredients from their whole-food sources rather than as additives to other foods. ✣ Would your great-grandmother have served this food? Finally, before you analyze the numbers, ask yourself if this food could have been served at your great-grandmother’s table. She served only real food. Understanding the Nutrition Label: Think Low GL and High PI Glycemic load, or GL, is a measure of how quickly a food enters your bloodstream. Low GL leads to better health. Phytonutrient index, or PI, refers to the amount of colorful plant pigments and compounds in a food that help prevent disease and promote health. High PI also leads to better health. Here are a few tips to maintain a low GL and a high PI. ✣ Look at the serving size and determine if this is your “typical” portion, as labels can be de - ceiving. For example, a cereal may state “3/4 cup serving,” when your typical portion is 1 1/2 cups. Or worse, it may say “2 servings,” when typically people consume the whole amount in the container or bottle. Have you ever known four people to share one pint of Häagen-Dazs ice cream? ✣ Are the calories high GL or low GL? The total amount of carbohydrates is less important than where they come from. If they are found in foods with a low GL and high PI, they will have a very different effect on your appetite and weight than will foods that are quickly absorbed and have few nutrients and fiber. How do you know which foods have a low GL and high PI? Simple. Choose whole-plant foods, and you can’t lose. ✣ Start with fiber. It is one of the main factors that determines the all-important glycemic load, and it can also give you a clue about the phytonutrient index. Many packaged foods have no fiber. If convenience items such as soups, entrées, or snacks are missing this key fiber factor, leave them on the shelf. ✣ Look at total carbohydrates. Remember that it’s the type of carbs that matters most. If they are from whole-plant foods that contain plenty of fiber or have a low GL, their effect is very different from that of fiberless foods. The same amount of carbohydrates from a can of beans or from a can of Coke affects the body in very different ways. ✣ Where are the good fats? Monounsaturated and omega-3 polyunsaturated fats should domi - nate this category, with minimal amounts of saturated fat and zero trans fats (present on food labels from 2006 on). Beware that small amounts of trans fats are STILL permitted in packaged foods as long as the food contains less than 0.5 grams per serving. But if you eat that food frequently or eat more than one serving (which is usually the case), you may get a load of trans fats. Therefore, look care - fully at the label, even if it says “zero trans fats.” Look for the words “hydrogenated” or “partially hydrogenated.” If you see those words, put the item back on the shelf. Unfortunately, omega-3 fats are rarely listed on the label. They are part of the polyunsaturated fat family, but they come from the good side of the family (they are anti-inflammatory; bad poly - unsaturated or omega-6 fats are inflammatory). Other processed and refined oils that are not as healthy as polyunsaturated fats also show up in this section of the label, including corn oil and safflower oil."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"40 Set the Stage for Success Now for the “Nutrition Facts” on the Label There are a number of important “Nutrition Facts” listed on food labels, as well. But make sure you keep your facts straight! Not all the nutritional information on the label is as important as it sounds, and some is more important than certain authorities would have you believe. If you’re going to use these “Nutrition Facts” effectively, you need to understand their true meaning. Keep the following in mind: ✣ Cholesterol. Your liver makes more cholesterol in an hour than you ever eat in a day. More cho - lesterol is produced in the body from eating sugar than from eating fat. There is little correlation between dietary cholesterol and blood cholesterol, and little reason to worry about this number on food labels. Yes, a surprising fact perhaps to many of you, but true. ✣ Protein. If you eat a variety of whole foods, you won’t have to worry about protein because whole foods such as beans, soy foods, nuts, seeds, whole grains, and lean animal foods contain plenty of protein. ✣ Sodium. If you are sodium sensitive, use this simple guideline: Double the calories to get an accurate estimate of how much sodium should be in the serving (for example, 150 calories per serving should have a maximum of 300 milligrams of sodium per serving). There’s an exception to this rule: very low-calorie foods, such as some vegetables without added salt. Many processed foods have far more sodium than this. You will need to prepare fresh foods at home to recondition your palate to whole foods naturally low in sodium. The recommended daily intake for the average person is 1,500 milligrams, or less than the amount in one teaspoon of salt (2,400 milligrams). That includes salt added at the table, in cooking at the factory, or in a fast-food kitchen (which is where most of our salt intake comes from—hidden in the processed and fast foods we consume, such as packaged meats, canned soup, and even cottage cheese!). We should consume about 10 times more potassium, mostly from plant foods (such as bananas, potatoes, spinach, and almonds), than sodium in our diet, yet we do just the opposite. We eat 10 times as much salt or sodium as potassium from table salt, processed foods, and restaurant foods. ✣ Calcium. Add a zero to the calcium percentage on the label. This equals the milligrams of calcium per serving because the “% Daily Value” for calcium is based on 1,000 milligrams. For example, 2 percent equals 20 milligrams calcium, and 30 percent equals 300 milligrams. Re - member that calcium is the only nutrient to which this rule applies. ✣ Other nutrients. B-12, iron, zinc, and other nutrients may have been added to the food prod - uct to enhance nutrient levels and will be listed on the label if the product was “fortified.” Many junk foods have vitamins or nutrients added. Beware: They can make you feel fine about eating bad-quality foods, yet they have no real benefit. ————— Suggestions for Success in Your Kitchen ————— When you are preparing and cooking your meals, keep these suggestions in mind. They can make cook - ing a relaxing and enjoyable experience, allowing food to become your ally instead of your enemy and your kitchen to become a sanctuary instead of a battleground."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"41 Set the Stage for Success ✣ With a little patience and practice, you will feel very comfortable in the kitchen. ✣ Get organized, think through your week ahead, and take one day each week to spend a few hours shopping and cooking. ✣ Carefully create a shopping list before you head to the store. (If you follow the six-week eating plan in this guide, you can use the shopping lists included in Section 4 for simplicity and ease.) ✣ When you come home from the store, organize your groceries in the refrigerator and pantry. ✣ Put on some fun music, wash and chop vegetables on the weekend or the day before you cook, and store them in zip-top bags in the refrigerator. You are much more likely to eat them if they are all ready to cook. ✣ Multitask while in the kitchen. Simmer some soup or cook a grain for the next day while pre - paring dinner. ✣ Also, double or even triple recipes, and then freeze some for later use. Having a meal ready to go in the freezer is as good as money in the bank! ————— Putting It Together to Build the Perfect Kitchen ————— Remember that your kitchen is one of the most important rooms in your home. It is the place where you prepare the food that is going to nourish and sustain you and your family. When your kitchen is out of balance or you don’t have the right tools, it is difficult to prepare healthy meals that turn on the genes that keep you healthy and help your body fix its broken brain. As you start on The UltraMind Solution, try to implement some (if not all) of the tips in this section so your kitchen and the time that you spend preparing food can be enjoyable and rewarding. Getting re-enchanted with nourishing, delicious food and with the pleasure of eating is so important— it is at the center of human life and belongs in an UltraKitchen, not in the front seat of your minivan! However, I am also aware that in today’s world, sitting down for a meal isn’t always possible. So before we move into the actual program, I want to review some ways that you can avoid common pitfalls, like eating out and eating on the go, that can make sticking to The UltraMind Solution more difficult. These tips will make staying on the program easier during the first six weeks and for a lifetime. ————— Avoiding Common Pitfalls: Eating Out and On the Go ————— You shouldn’t let frequent travel, being out of the house, or working at mealtime get in your way of a healthy mind and body. When you travel, it can be somewhat difficult to find quality food options that fit into The UltraMind Solution. When you go to work, it can be daunting to have to prepare and pack a lunch every day. What follows are a number of menus that you can easily take with you. You can either prepare these on"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"42 Set the Stage for Success the road or prepare them in advance and bring them with you in a cooler. They help you stay out of trouble in the vast minefield of convenience stores and junk food that awaits you when you leave home. Grab-and-Go Options These grab-and-go options give you some quick choices when you are really busy and don’t have time to prepare a whole meal. And they still allow you to eat healthy, whole foods. You can use any of these options during the six-week plan and beyond. These foods can be prepared at home in advance. Consider keeping a small cooler in your car so you are never without healthy choices. You can store these foods in your cooler and pull them out as needed. In addition to these grab-and-go options, I often suggest canned beans or legumes as well as frozen vegetables. You can heat these up at work for a simple, healthy meal. You can also cook dried beans or chop fresh vegetables yourself in advance, and then bring these as food options. Breakfast choices Grab-and-Go Breakfast #1: Yogurt Parfait ✣ Plain organic soy yogurt ✣ Fresh or frozen berries ✣ Milled flaxseed ✣ Chopped raw nuts such as almonds, wal - nuts, or pecans Grab-and-Go Breakfast #2: Morning Wrap ✣ Tofu, baked ✣ Sprouted grain corn tortilla ✣ Dijon mustard with curry powder ✣ Fresh fruit in season Grab-and-Go Breakfast #3: Eggs Dijon ✣ Hard-boiled omega-3 eggs (Hard-boiled the night before) ✣ Yogurt Dijon (2 parts plain organic soy yogurt with 1 part Dijon mustard) ✣ Fresh fruit in season Grab-and-Go Breakfast #4: Nutty Banana ✣ Banana ✣ Natural nut or seed butter (almond, macadamia, cashew, sunflower) ✣ Chopped nuts such as Brazil nuts or wal - nuts Grab-and-Go Breakfast #5: Omega Morning ✣ Sardines or wild salmon ✣ Red onion, tomato, and fresh dill sprigs ✣ Gluten-free flax crackers ✣ Pink grapefruit"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"43 Set the Stage for Success The key to staying on the program when you are busy or traveling is never being caught without a healthy, whole-foods eating option. I’m extremely busy. I treat patients, travel internationally to present at and attend conferences, and write books. But I stick to the programs outlined in my books. How? I always have a snack with me in case I get hungry. In addition to the grab-and-go options above, make sure your cooler is stocked with a few emergency snack items. These might include: ✣ Almonds, macadamia nuts, walnuts, pecans, or any mixture of these ✣ Healthy snack bars (see Resources for options) ✣ Fresh fruit ✣ Chopped vegetables in zip-top bags However, I am also aware that eating out is sometimes necessary—both for business and pleasure.

But as awareness grows and the needs of health conscious diners are met, menu options are changing, meaning that nutritionally intelligent choices are becoming more available. Even some chain restaurants offer healthy options. A few simple suggestions about dining out can go a long way toward keeping you healthy and boosting your brain power. Remember that there are no good or bad foods so long as they are whole foods (with a few exceptions). As Paracelsus, the ancient physician, reminds us, “The dose makes the poison.” ✣ Prepare your mind before you begin your meal by practicing the soft-belly breathing tech - nique. (See Chapter 16 of The UltraMind Solution for details.) This is especially important when dining out because you may not always be able to control the menu’s quality, but by eating with awareness, you will be more likely to control your overall intake. ✣ Discover some “slow food” restaurants where the atmosphere and ambience are soothing to your senses. Our eating environment influences how much we end up eating. ✣ Enjoy ethnic cuisine including Indian, Japanese, Thai, Mediterranean (Italian, Greek, and Spanish), and Middle Eastern. You will reap different nutritional benefits from traditional ingre - dients such as lemongrass in Thai dishes, sea vegetables in Japanese dishes, curry in Indian dishes, and great greens such as escarole or broccoli rabe in Mediterranean dishes. ✣ Be inquisitive. Ask questions about ingredients and don’t be afraid to ask for substitutions in a dish. For example, instead of white rice, request brown rice; instead of a starchy fried vegetable, double the green vegetable. ✣ Mix and match menu items. If you see a dish on the menu that comes with cranberry orange relish and your dish comes with gravy, ask the waiter to substitute the relish for the gravy. If your dish has a vegetable you don’t particularly like, while another dish has a vegetable you adore, mix and match to get the healing foods you love. ✣ Request a “crudités platter” with fresh vegetables and fruit, or maybe even olives, as a starter or appetizer instead of raiding the breadbasket. Pairing bread and alcohol at the beginning of a meal increases your hunger, and the alcohol decreases your inhibitions, making it more likely you’ll make a play for the cheesecake. ✣ Request “double the veggies.” Restaurants may overload the quantity of fish, meat, and poultry, only to skimp on the produce, especially the steamed vegetables. ✣ Order a light drink. Try a Virgin Mary, sparkling water with a spritz of lemon or lime, or an herbal tea instead of alcohol before the meal. ✣ Check in with your gut-brain before ordering dessert. Rate your sense of satisfaction, and if you are a “3–Gently Satisfied” (1–Not Satisfied, 2/3–Gently Satisfied, 4/5–Too Full), then use your freedom of choice to skip dessert. There will always be another night for the perfect indulgence. With these suggestions and strategies in place, it is now time to start the program. In the next section, I will explain how to execute the preparation phase (the week before the program actually starts) both easily and painlessly."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"S E C T I O N 3 : —————————————————— THE PREPARATION WEEK— PREPARING MIND, BODY, AND SPIRIT ——————— A n important part of The UltraMind Solution is the one-week preparation phase that precedes the program. One week before you start the program, you have the opportunity to prepare your body and mind for all the goodness to come by shedding habits that interfere with your metabolism and brain health. I recommend eliminating items from your diet in a systematic way. This may keep you from potential withdrawal symptoms, make you feel better, and jump-start the process to a better brain. Remember, over the course of the preparation week, you will eliminate these items from your diet: ✣ Caffeine ✣ Processed and refined carbohydrates and sugar ✣ High-fructose corn syrup ✣ Hydrogenated (trans) fats ✣ Processed, packaged, junk, and fast foods ✣ Alcohol To help make this transition as simple and painless as possible, follow the steps below. They will help you eliminate caffeine, sugar, and white flour from your diet. These are the items people usually have the most trouble giving up, so getting these out of your system before the program starts will make the program im - measurably easier. ————— How to Eliminate Caffeine in Seven Days ————— If you have been drinking caffeine for a long time, you have to get off it over a few days. Minimize your pain and the difficulty of giving up your addiction by following these steps. Step 1: Start on a Weekend You may want to start on a Sunday. This will allow you to take naps as needed, since your body will be recovering from the lack of caffeine and you will be liable to be fatigued. Step 2: Reducing Your Caffeine Intake For the first three days (Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday), cut your daily intake of coffee, cola, black tea, or other caffeinated beverages in half. That means if you usually have four cups of coffee in the morning, you would have two cups of coffee in the morning on Sunday, one cup on Monday, and half a cup on Tuesday. Doing this helps you wean your body off the caffeine, which should reduce withdrawal symptoms."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"46 The Preparation Week – Preparing Mind, Body, and Spirit Step 3: Drink Green Tea For the next four days (the remainder of the week), you can drink one cup of caffeinated green tea steeped for five minutes in boiling water. You may continue drinking green tea for all its wonderful health and weight benefits. (Note that I recommend green tea as part of your morning ritual while you are on the program.) You can switch to decaffeinated green tea if you want to eliminate caffeine completely. Otherwise it is fine to have one cup of caffeinated, organic green tea every morning. The caffeine is minimal and the health benefits are great. Step 4: Take Vitamin C Throughout this process, I recommend taking 1,000–2,000 milligrams of buffered pure ascorbic acid (vitamin C) as a powder or in capsules. This may help you detoxify and balance your system. Step 5: Drink Plenty of Clean Water You should also drink at least six to eight glasses of filtered water a day. You should do this regardless of whether you are getting off caffeine, but it is especially important for this process because it will keep your body well hydrated and can reduce headaches, minimize constipation, and flush toxins out of your system. ————— How to Eliminate Sugar and White Flour ————— Eliminating sugar is hard because it’s an addiction. But the physical cravings dissipate quickly once you stop eating it—typically within two weeks. Here are some tips for how you can successfully do this. ✣ Start five to seven days before you begin the program—you will not regret this! It will make your transition into the program easier. I would recommend starting the same day you cut your caffeine intake in half (the Sunday before you start the program). ✣ The tried and true method from my experience with thousands of patients: Go cold turkey from all white flour and sugar products. (Don’t cheat—it will only make it worse!) ✣ Include protein for breakfast, such as eggs, nuts, seeds, nut butters, or a protein shake. Once you are on the program, you should have plenty of protein for breakfast. See Section 5 for breakfast recipes, including my delicious UltraShake. ✣ Combine “good” protein, “good” fat, and “good” carbs at each meal. Good proteins are fish, or - ganic eggs, small amounts of lean poultry, nuts, soy, whole grains, and legumes. Good fats are fish, extra-virgin olive oil, olives, nuts, seeds, and avocados. Good carbs are beans, vegetables, whole grains, and fruit. ✣ Don’t go low fat. Consume olive oil, olives, nuts, seeds, and avocados every day. Despite com - monly held beliefs, these fats are NOT fattening."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"47 The Preparation Week – Preparing Mind, Body, and Spirit ✣ Eat every three hours. Snack on nuts and seeds such as almonds, walnuts, or pumpkin seeds (raw or dry roasted only). One serving is a handful or 10 to 12 nuts. ✣ Drink at least six to eight glasses of filtered water a day. ————— How to Avoid Withdrawal Symptoms ————— The unfortunate reality is that making these changes in your diet is liable to cause a few withdrawal symptoms. They include: ✣ Bad breath ✣ Constipation (should be addressed aggressively by following the steps below) ✣ Achy, flu-like feeling ✣ Fatigue ✣ Headaches ✣ Hunger ✣ Irritability ✣ Itchy skin ✣ Nausea ✣ Offensive body odor ✣ Sleep difficulties (too much or too little) These symptoms are actually a good sign. They mean that your body and mind are eliminating stored toxins and finding their way to balance and UltraWellness. Those who consume the most caffeine, alcohol, and sugar, and those who have the most food allergies will have the most difficulty initially. In any event, symptoms of withdrawal usually disappear after three or four days. Here are some suggestions for what to do if your symptoms become uncomfortable: 1. Make sure you drink at least six to eight glasses of filtered water daily. 2 2. To prevent headaches, make sure your bowels are clear If you tend toward constipation, follow the steps to address constipation below. 3. If you are tired, allow more time for sleep. 4. Make sure you exercise daily to help fight off fatigue. 5. If you are hungry, have some protein in the afternoon, such as a handful of nuts or seeds such as almonds, pecans, walnuts, pumpkin seeds, cooked beans, or a piece of steamed or baked fish. 2 The best water to drink has been passed through a filtering process. Common and inexpensive filters are available, such as carbon filters like the ones Brita makes. The best filter is a reverse osmosis filter that puts the water through a multistep process to remove microbes, pesticides, metals, and other toxins. This type of filter can be installed under the sink. It’s a great filtering system (and is cheaper over the long run). Water in plastic bottles contains phthalates, a toxic petrochemical. Mineral water or still water in glass bottles is also acceptable."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"48 The Preparation Week – Preparing Mind, Body, and Spirit 6. If you’re irritable or have trouble sleeping, take a combination of calcium citrate (500 mg) and magnesium citrate (250 mg) before bed. 7. If you have an upset stomach, drink ginger or peppermint tea. Steep a tea bag in boiling water for 10 minutes, and drink up to four cups a day as often as needed. Constipation and Keeping Your Bowels Clear on The UltraMind Solution One problem I hear people complain of often when they are on the program is constipation. I define being constipated as having fewer than two bowel movements a day. Many people go less often than once or twice a day. Some may even go only once a week. Even if this has been your pattern your whole life, it is NOT normal! It needs to be addressed. For some people, problems with constipation are exacerbated when they go on the program because of the sudden change in the way they are eating. This may result in an increase in your withdrawal symptoms and make you feel ill. You may even experi - ence achy, flu-like symptoms such as headaches, brain fog, and fatigue. Constipation may also inhibit your progress toward an UltraMind because it sabotages your body’s abil - ity to detoxify. Toxins in your gut are reabsorbed when your bowel isn’t clear. That is why it is critical that you clear out your bowel before the program begins and keep it clear while you are on the program. In fact, I recommend clearing out your bowel at the start the program even if you aren’t constipated. This is a good thing to do because it helps ensure that your bowels are functioning properly so you can maximize your power to detoxify. Overcoming constipation is an important part of your journey to long-term health. Even after the pro - gram has ended, you can follow these steps anytime you are faced with constipation. Step 1: Basic Bowel Care If you are you are constipated during your preparation week or any time over the course of the six-week UltraMind Solution, I strongly encourage you to use the supplements recommended below to help you overcome the problem. ✣ Eat two tablespoons of ground flaxseed a day, sprinkled on salads or vegetables. You can also put them in your UltraShake if you choose to make that for breakfast. See Section 4 for the recipe. Flaxseeds absorb a lot of water and provide omega 3-fats and plenty of fiber. ✣ Take an EXTRA two to four 100–150 milligram capsules of magnesium citrate twice a day. Reduce the dose or stop completely if your bowels become too loose. Many of us are magne - sium deficient. Common symptoms of magnesium deficiency include constipation, headaches, muscle cramps, menstrual cramps, insomnia, palpitations, and anxiety. ✣ Take 1,000-2,000 milligrams of buffered ascorbic acid (vitamin C) as a powder or in capsules once or twice a day. This also helps with detoxification and supporting your immune system.. These products can also be safely used over the long term to keep your bowels regular and healthy in the months and years ahead."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"49 The Preparation Week – Preparing Mind, Body, and Spirit Step 2: Take an Herbal Laxative In some cases, herbal laxatives are a good way to treat constipation. They help clear out your bowels, keeping them free from toxic buildup. If you try the steps above and they don’t work, you can try using an herbal laxative. Common prepara - tions include cascara, senna, and rhubarb. Take two to three capsules before bed. These should NOT be used regularly, as they are habit forming and may make your colon lazy. You can safely use them for up to seven days, although if you follow Step 1, you will probably not need them for that long. By the end of one week, your bowel should be functioning properly, so going off the laxatives should not be an issue. Step 3: Magnesium Citrate Liquid If you have not had a bowel movement by the day after you take the herbal laxative, try taking one bottle of magnesium citrate liquid. You should only need it once if you add Step 4. After drinking the liquid, you should have a bowel movement within six hours. If you don’t have a bowel movement within six hours, move on to Step 4. But do this no more than twice over the course of the preparation week. It should not be used regularly. Magnesium citrate liquid is available at any drugstore. It is often used to help clear out the bowel before colonoscopies or surgery. It can also be used to clear out the bowel if you become constipated during the program and if Steps 1 and 2 are not effective. Do not use this if you have inflammatory bowel disease or diverticulitis, if you have had recent abdomi - nal or bowel surgery, or if you have had any type of bowel blockage or impaction without first consulting with your doctor. Step 4: Dulcolax or Bisacodyl Suppository or Fleet Enema Most people can achieve a normal bowel movement with Step 1 alone. Step 2 can be helpful in more extreme cases. Steps 3 and 4 are rarely needed. If you still have not had a bowel movement six hours after taking the magnesium citrate liquid, you should take a Dulcolax or Bisacodyl suppository or a Fleet Enema. Both are available at any drugstore. The suppository is inserted into the rectum and usually results in a bowel movement in two to three hours. Use the Fleet enema as directed. Step 5: If You Still Have Not Had a Bowel Movement If you still have not had a bowel movement after following Steps 1–4, then you need to see your physi - cian for a full evaluation. By following the guidelines carefully and ensuring that you have daily bowel movements, you will not only enhance your detoxification process, you should also be able to further minimize withdrawal symp - toms."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"50 The Preparation Week – Preparing Mind, Body, and Spirit Often when we stop eating foods we are allergic to, the reactions can intensify for one to three days. This is common, short-lived, and followed by a greatly renewed sense of well-being. A so-called healing crisis (feeling very fatigued or achy) can also occur if your system is not supported to clear out toxins. The most important thing you can do is make sure your bowel is cleared out at the begin - ning of the program and throughout this process by having two or more bowel movements a day. Follow the recommendations above to make sure this happens. Following these steps should minimize any withdrawal symptoms you experience during your prepara - tion week or the first few days you are on The UltraMind Solution. Remember, detoxifying means getting rid of the bad stuff in your body and brain. Sometimes that’s uncomfortable at first, but your body and mind will thank you in the end. Once your preparation week is complete, it’s time to start your journey to an UltraMind. In the next section, I have reprinted the checklist from the book.

That is why I created the daily checklist for the six-week program. It has been reprinted below for your convenience. You can print this out and use it every day on the program if you wish (or at least as long as it takes for you to integrate this routine into your daily life). If you use this checklist in conjunction with the eating plan in Section 5, you will keep to the program and have a much better chance at helping your body fix its broken brain and achieving an UltraMind. ————— Daily Checklist for the Six-Week Program ————— Use the following checklist every day you are on the program.

In Chapter 14 of The UltraMind Solution, I outlined the nutritional principles and eating guidelines you need to follow while on the program. While those guidelines are enough for you to get and stay on the pro - gram successfully, I am aware that many people like to have a bit more guidance regarding what to eat and when. People especially love learning healthy new brain-food recipes they can use to develop an UltraMind. That is why I developed two weeks’ worth of daily menus you can rotate over the course of the pro - gram. In reality, you can use any of the recipes in the pages that follow any day you are on The UltraMind Solution. However, I structured daily menus so you don’t have to think too much about how to achieve an UltraMind. If you want to keep the program extremely easy, follow the menus as outlined for the first 14 days. After two weeks using these recipes, you will have a good sense of what your body and brain crave and how to nourish them properly. At that stage, you can either pick and choose daily menus for the remaining four weeks or you can just pick out recipes you fall in love with and make those as you wish. For each week’s recipes, I have also created a comprehensive shopping list that will make it easy to shop for all the food you need to make these delicious and nourishing meals.

First, they make far more than the one or two servings you will eat each week. I recommend that you make them the first week you are on the program and then store them to use in subsequent weeks. I have included these ingredients on the shopping list for Week 1 for this reason. Also note that any of the snacks are interchangeable. You can eat morning snacks in the afternoon, after - noon snacks in the morning. You can eat the same snacks everyday if you wish, and you can even exchange them for an UltraShake or a simple handful of nuts or seeds. This part of the program has a great deal of flexibility. If you buy the ingredients for your snacks during the first week, you should have enough for at least three weeks of the program.

This may help motivate you to continue on your journey to an UltraMind and UltraWellness, give you a feel - ing of happiness and peace as you realize the changes you feel inside are real, or it may simply satisfy your curiosity. Whatever the case, many people find tracking their progress an interesting and fulfilling process. What follows are specific questionnaires that assess mood, cognitive function, and attention. They can help you assess the changes in your mood, memory, attention, and brain function. ————— Mental and Cognitive Health Tracker ————— Go through this “Mental and Cognitive Health Tracker.” If you identify with any of the problems men - tioned in the quizzes below or struggle with similar or related problems, The UltraMind Solution can help you achieve optimal health. The quizzes in the book (those reprinted in Section 1 of this guide) are based on the seven keys to an UltraMind. They help you identify the CAUSES for your brain or cognitive problems. Addressing the un - derlying causes will help you achieve an UltraMind. However, just as it is helpful to track the changes in your seven key biological systems (the seven keys to UltraWellness or an UltraMind) at the root of all health and disease (as well as brain function), it is also helpful to track your PROBLEMS so you can see how your body fixes your broken brain. That’s why I have created this “Mental and Cognitive Health Tracker.” It will help you (and your health care practitioner) track your progress according to traditional ways of thinking about mental illness and cognitive and neurological function—creating a common language you can both use to communicate about how you feel. The “Mental and Cognitive Health Tracker” consists of nine separate quizzes that will give you a clear record of your progress on the path to an UltraMind. I recommend that you take these quizzes twice—once before you start the program and once after you finish the six-week UltraMind Solution. Doing so will give you an excellent sense of how The UltraMind Solution has helped you achieve optimum health. Start by carefully going through and answering the questions in each of the nine quizzes below. At the end, add up all your subtotals to get an overall sense of your brain function. The first time you take the quiz, base your answers on your mental and cognitive health profiles for the past 30 days. After you have completed The UltraMind Solution, take the quiz again. This time, rate your symptoms based on how you feel that day. If you scored 0 on any of the nine quizzes the first time you took them, then just skip those. Some quizzes may not apply to you at all. In that case, you can simply ignore them when you do your final assessment on this tracker."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"121 Track Your Progress Please note that this questionnaire is not a replacement for regular checkups or diagnoses by health care or psychologi - cal health professionals.

Some of you may be interested in keeping track of these changes along with the changes in your brain function. Below you will find a chart that will help you track changes in your weight, BMI, waist, hips, and waist- to-hip ratio. It isn’t critical that you fill out these worksheets; however, for those interested, I felt that they would make a nice inclusion. ( Note : Your BMI and waist-to-hip ratio are also necessary for you to accurately answer questions in some of the quizzes. The tracking tools for those measurements have been included for that reason as well.) Waist, Hips, and Waist-to-Hip Ratio 1. Measure Your Waist —Take your waist measurement by wrapping a tape measure across your back and around your belly button. 2. Measure Your Hips —Measure your hips at their widest point. This should be right below the bones of your pelvis and around your butt. 3. Calculate Your Waist-to-Hip Ratio —To obtain your waist-to-hip ratio, divide your waist measurement by your hip measurement. 4. Interpret Your Results —If your waist-to-hip ratio is over 0.8 for a woman or 0.9 for a man, you have too much belly fat. This is a sign of insulin resistance and blood sugar imbalance, both of which can lead to a broken brain. Body Mass Index or BMI To find your BMI, you can do either of these two things: 1. Use the following formula: BMI = [Weight in pounds / (Height in inches) × (Height in inches)] × 703 For example, if I am 5'8\" (68 inches) and 165 pounds, my BMI would be calculated as follows: My BMI = [165/(68 × 68)] × 703 = 25 2.

Then trace over to the column that is closest to your weight. The number at the top of this column is your BMI. Again, let’s use the example above to illustrate. I go down the column to 5'8\". Then I scan over to find the closest approximation to my weight. There is no listing for 165 pounds, but there is one for 164 pounds (this is close enough). If you look at the top of that column, you will see the number 25. This is the same BMI measurement we identified using the formula. If you don’t find your weight listed in the chart above, find the closest approximation. This will give you a close enough estimate for your BMI. BMI is a useful method for indirectly determining how much body fat you have. It helps you determine your weight category by comparing your height and weight against other people of different heights and weights. Once you have identified your BMI, you can use the chart below to determine your weight category: ✣ Less than 18—Underweight ✣ 18–24—Normal weight ✣ 25–29—Overweight ✣ Above 30—Obese"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"130 Track Your Progress Keep in mind that this is only one method for determining your weight category. It is not always defini - tive in and of itself. This is because it is based on what is considered a “normal” body type by most health professionals. Of course, what “normal” is varies a great deal from person to person. So don’t automatically assume you are obese if you score above 30. Having said that, BMI is still an important factor to keep in mind and one I use in my own practice as I assess patients. Here is the chart you can use to keep track of all your vital measurements.

It is the best antidepressant and anti-anxiety medication available, it reduces inflammation, improves mood, balances neurotransmitter function, and increases neuroplasticity and neurogenesis, just to mention a few of the positive effects it has on your brain. If exercise could be put in a pill, it would be the biggest blockbuster medication of all time. Unfortu - nately, today, nearly half of Americans live a sedentary lifestyle and 88 percent don’t get enough exercise. No wonder we have an epidemic of broken brains! On the six-week plan, I only ask you to commit to 30 minutes of vigorous walking every day. However, more is better, and for those of you who want a more comprehensive exercise regimen (which I strongly encourage), here are some guidelines. ————— Aerobic Conditioning: The Basics ————— ✣ Do 30 minutes of aerobic conditioning exercise at least 5 days a week ✣ Aerobic conditioning is anything that gets your heart rate up consistently between 70 − 85 per - cent of your maximal heart rate. To calculate your target heart rate, subtract your age from 220, and then multiply the resulting amount by .70 to .85. For example, if you are 45-years old, sub - tract 45 from 220, which is 175, and then multiply that by .70 and .85. In this case, your target heart rate would range from 122 to 148. ✣ Use a heart rate monitor; it can help you maintain your pace. I recommend Polar heart rate monitors—you can find out more at www.polarusa.com . ✣ Add interval training 3 days a week, if possible (see below). If you are over 30 years old, you should have a complete physical exam before starting an interval-training program. Interval Training: What It Is and How to Do It Interval training is short bursts of high-intensity exercise followed by a longer period of lighter exercise (what we called wind sprints in high school, or what the Swedes call fartlek or “speed play”). While interval training was designed for maximizing professional athletes’ performance, the average person can greatly benefit from it as well. I recommend it. It is a powerful (and time-saving) way to get and stay in shape, both mentally and physi - cally."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"134 Optimize Your Exercise Program Benefits of Interval Training 1. Improves overall fitness level or the ability to utilize oxygen. The more oxygen we use, the more calories we burn. 2. Increases postexercise fat burning and calorie expenditure, even at rest or sleep. 3. You can exercise for less time and achieve greater fitness, weight loss, and brain health benefits. 4. You can naturally increase growth hormone levels, BDNF (the super fertilizer for your brain), and improve insulin function, which promotes fat burning and muscle and brain building. How to Do Interval Training What follows is a step-by-step overview of how interval training works. There is a version for people who are just beginning to exercise as well as one for those who are a little more advanced and have been working out regularly already. If you don’t fit either of these categories (i.e., if you can’t walk for 30 minutes at 3.5 mph), then you should build up your aerobic exercise program before you start incorporating interval training. Start by walking vigorously for 30 minutes every day, as prescribed in The UltraMind Solution. Beginners (someone who could walk for 30 minutes at 3.5 mph) ✣ Step 1. Warm up: 5 minutes of walking at 3.5 mph. ✣ Step 2. Speed up and walk at 4.0 mph for 60 seconds. ✣ Step 3. Slow down and stroll at 3.0 mph for 90 seconds. ✣ Step 4. Repeat the previous 2 steps 5 more times. ✣ Step 5. Finish with 5 minutes of walking at a comfortable pace to cool down. Advanced Interval Program ✣ Step 1. Warm up: 5 minutes of jogging or cycling at the lowest possible percentage of your all- out effort. ✣ Step 2. Run or cycle for 60 seconds at about 85 to 90 percent of your all-out effort. Your leg muscles should fatigue within about 1minute. (Basically, the speed you’d run or cycle at to save your life equals 100 percent of your all-out effort. From there, adjust how fast and hard you work so your output reflects the recommended percentage.) ✣ Step 3. Slow down to 60 percent of your all-out effort for 90 seconds. (Make sure you slow down to this very light pace.) ✣ Step 4. Repeat the previous 2 steps 5 more times. ✣ Step 5. Finish with five minutes at 60 percent of your all-out effort to cool down.

One exercise I have my patients perform in the office is to stand up out of a chair without leaning forward or using their arms. It is incredible how many people (even younger people) have lost so much muscle that their thighs can’t even lift their body weight off the chair without some help. Try it yourself now. Strength training helps to increase muscle size and strength and increases the number of mitochondria in your body (they are found in the highest concentration in muscle cells and the brain), which are essential for energy production and optimal brain function. It can also boost your metabolic rate so you burn more calories at rest or sleeping. Find something you like, maybe vary it, but try something. Using your own body weight by doing an activity such as yoga (now practiced by 17 million Americans), stair climbing, push-ups, or squats can be great. Finding a gym and using weights is another way to build muscle. If you have never lifted weights, be sure to get some help from the fitness trainer in the gym to use proper technique and form and avoid injury. Ideally, you want to build up to two sets of eight to ten repetitions of an exercise using a weight that leads to muscle fatigue for each major muscle group. A 20-minute routine two to three times a week can cover all the bases. Who doesn’t have 40 to 60 minutes a week to invest in his or her health and boosting brain power? ————— Stay Flexible ————— A stiff body usually reflects a stiff brain. And keeping flexible with stretching or yoga prevents injury and general pain from any other type of activity. With some types of yoga, you can even achieve aerobic exercise, strength training, and stretching all in one workout. To stay flexible, here is what I suggest: ✣ Try to stretch for at least 5 minutes before and after every time you exercise. ✣ Do 30 − 60 minutes of whole body stretching twice a week. Exercise will help you stay mentally and physically fit by exerting yourself daily. But, as I discussed throughout The UltraMind Solution , all things in the body and mind require balance. Relaxation is as impor - tant as exercise. And it is a skill you need to learn as well."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"S E C T I O N 9 : —————————————————— RELAX MORE DEEPLY ——————— D o you know where your pause button is? Do you know how to push it? If not, your brain could be in big trouble. We live in a stressed-out world. Everything in our environment, from perpetual pressure at work to feel - ing overwhelmed with the kids, to our SAD diet and environmental toxins, stress out our bodies and minds. The way we live causes us to have a hard time focusing, remembering, and just feeling happy and alive. But so few make the connection between the stress in their lives and the stress in their bodies and brains... Aside from eating breakfast regularly and eating more fruits and vegetables, the one characteristic pres - ent in all the healthy aged is resiliency—the ability to recover from or adjust easily to misfortune or change. How do we develop this sense of resilience? One way is to learn how to get and remain relaxed, even during stressful situations. However, doing this takes practice. You have to relax actively—consciously engage in the process of softening and calming your mind and body. You can also simply reduce the amount of stressors in your life. Many of us haven’t even identified what causes us to feel overwhelmed all the time. Even fewer have taken a good, hard look at stressors that they could eliminate from their lives. Because eliminating stressors and learning how to actively relax (or push that pause button) are so essen - tial in the creation of an UltraMind, this section of the guide is dedicated to providing you with additional tools to help you relax and be free from stress. ————— Identify and Eliminate Stressors ————— Looking closely at the habits of our life—both what we do and how we think—is not something most of us do on a regular basis. We often don’t connect the choices we make in our diets; in our relationships; in our work; or in the use of brain-altering substances like sugar, caffeine, and alcohol with how we feel everyday. Eating junk food, drinking six cups of coffee a day, having those two cocktails at night to calm down, watching four hours of television a day, doing work we hate, or being stuck in relationships that don’t give us peace or joy—we tend to accept these without giving too much thought to how they drive our moods and brain function. However, these things and many more are stressing out our bodies and minds. Realistically, no one can eliminate all the causes of stress in his or her life. But all of us can take an inventory—a close examination of our daily habits—and consider which things we can let go of that are triggering stress and what things we can add to help us heal and thrive."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"137 Relax More Deeply In the form below, consider which things give you energy and which things deplete your energy or make you feel stressed out.

Add one thing to your life that gives you energy. Do this once a week during the six-week program, and your life will transform. ————— Activating the Relaxation Response ————— Even if you can’t eliminate all the stressors in your life, there are ways that you can encourage your body and brain to relax intentionally when faced with stressful situations. Engaging in activities that turn on what Herbert Benson, MD, of the Harvard Mind-Body Institute, calls the relaxation response can be a great an - tidote to chronic psychosocial or physical stress. There are many ways you can activate the relaxation response. I gave you many ideas (including soft- belly breathing, which is an essential part of the UltraMind Solution) in the book. However, there are many other ways to practice pushing your pause button. Choose techniques you enjoy that fit into your life and conform to your personal needs and beliefs. Here are some more ways you can begin to relax: In addition to the ideas above, I would like to offer you three step-by-step exercises that will help you deepen your experience of relaxation. ✣ Mindfulness meditation ✣ Autogenic training ✣ Progressive muscular relaxation ✣ Regular exercise, including jogging and swimming ✣ Lamaze breathing exercises ✣ Yoga ✣ Tai qi ✣ Qigong ✣ Guided imagery ✣ Biofeedback ✣ Cognitive behavioral therapy ✣ Personal coaching ✣ Prayer ✣ Laughter therapy ✣ Massage ✣ Acupuncture ✣ Shamanic healing ✣ Energy medicine ✣ Adequate sleep ✣ Community connection (join a group) ✣ Take an UltraBath (20 minutes of soak - ing in a hot bath with 2 cups of Epsom salt and 10 drops of lavender essential oil) ✣ Eat stress-free foods (whole, real, organic, fresh, plant-based, low-glycemic, high- phytonutrient, omega-3-fat-containing foods) ✣ Take stress-reducing nutrients (folic acid, magnesium, vitamin D, vitamin C, ome - ga-3 fatty acids) ✣ Take stress-reducing herbs (rhodiola, ashwagandha, Siberian ginseng, ginseng, schizandra, licorice)"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"139 Relax More Deeply Active Relaxation Tip #1: Soft-Belly Breathing The soft-belly breathing you learned in The UltraMind Solution is a core component of the program. Not only does it stimulate your vagus nerve, it also helps you retrain your breathing so you can maintain (or get back to) a relaxed state more easily. Because it is so critical, I want to reiterate my instructions on how to do it here and give you some tips on how you can enhance its effect even more. To start with, let’s review the basic formula for the technique I outlined in my book: 1. Put your hand on your belly and allow your abdomen to relax. 2. Close your eyes or soften your focus, looking at the floor a few feet in front of you. 3. Inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth. 4. Breath deeply into your abdomen and feel it expand as you count to 5. 5. Pause for a count of 1. 6. Exhale slowly to a count of 5, allowing your body to relax and release tension. 7. Repeat for 5 breaths or until you feel relaxed. You do this five times a day, every day you are on The UltraMind Solution—upon waking, before every meal, and before you go to bed. I call this my 5x5x5 breathing program because you take five breaths to the count of five, five times a day. To enhance the effects of soft-belly breathing and activate your relaxation response even more, you can include any of the following techniques: ✣ Start by getting into a comfortable position. If you’re at home, sit in your favorite chair or lie down somewhere comfortable. If you’re at the office, sit comfortably on your chair with your feet on the floor, your back straight, and your hands on your lap. You may want to unbutton the top button on your pants or loosen your shirt a little. Do whatever you need to make yourself comfortable. ✣ Bring your attention to your breathing slowly. Instead of rushing into the technique, take a few moments to slow down and notice how you are breathing and feeling. Are you breathing in through your nose or in through your mouth? Are you taking shallow breaths or full, deep breaths? Where can you feel your breath in your body? Is it in your chest or in your belly? ✣ Use the word “relax” or another calming mantra. When you exhale, either think or say the word “relax” to your self. Inhale. Then exhale. RELAX . Inhale. Exhale. RELAX . You can also use a different calming mantra, if you wish. Some examples include “peace” or “joy,” and you can even use calming scenes that make you feel relaxed or at peace, like “ocean” or “forest.” Whatever you choose, consciously telling yourself to relax and find peace as you breathe is a powerful addition. ✣ Give yourself the time and space to enjoy this process. If you feel rushed to relax, if it becomes a project you have to complete, it will not be effective. Take the time to enjoy breath - ing and relaxing. You can even continue this process for 5−10 minutes, if you like. Simply focus on breathing into your abdomen and telling yourself to relax. As you do so, feel what happens to your body. Let any places where you feel tension unwind. Let your body feel like a loose rope. Physically relax. Give yourself this gift. You deserve it."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"140 Relax More Deeply Active Relaxation Tip #2: Special Place Imagery Visualization is another very powerful relaxation tool. Taking time during the week to do a guided visu - alization in which you visit a special, serene place in your mind’s eye gives you the opportunity to unwind and enjoy the power of your imagination for a moment. There are many CDs on the market that will walk you through a guided visualization. I have included some recommendations in the Resources section. But to introduce you to the technique, I want to share a visualization I created. I hope you enjoy it. Guided Visualization Dialogue Take a moment to sit back and relax. Gently close your eyes and breathe deeply into your abdomen. Feel yourself in your body, right now, in this moment. As you breathe, allow your body to completely relax. Stress is flowing out of you with each breath. Your body is becoming limp and comfortable. Let the tension in your brow go. Let the tension in your lips go. Let the tension in your eyes go. Just relax in the comfort - able darkness that surrounds you. PAUSE Once you feel completely relaxed and centered, start to bring yourself to one of your favorite peaceful places. This could be a place you have been before, like a silent redwood grove with cool shade and towering ancient trees that protect you in their mammoth embrace, or a white-sand beach where the ocean waves gently lap the shore and the smell of the sea air makes you feel at home. Or it could be a place built in your imagination: a lovely slowly swaying bridge that you stand on, watch - ing the babbling brook flow away beneath it, or an ancient oak in autumn, something out of old legend, where golden leaves fall around you as you sit under the shade and watch the golden-orange sun pass over the horizon into twilight. Wherever this special, peaceful place is for you, take some time to imagine it as completely as you can all around you. PAUSE Once you have your special place in mind, bring yourself into the picture. Imagine that you are in this beautiful place. Put yourself there. Talk a walk and look at the lovely, peaceful, relaxing surroundings. Before you were looking at this peaceful scene like a painting, from a distance. Now you are in the scene. You are living it. Be there now. PAUSE What do you see around you? There is no need to verbally answer this question. Just look around and see what you see. What in this scene is most relaxing to you? Take a walk through this special place and see all that you see. PAUSE What do you smell in the air? Can you smell the trees and the soil of the forest floor beneath you? Do you smell the salty air of the oceanside? Bring scent into your visualization. Smell the air where you are. PAUSE"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"141 Relax More Deeply Reach out and touch something that is attractive and peaceful to you. How does it feel? Is it soft to your touch? You are living in the scene. You can feel the ground beneath you and the air on your skin. How does it feel? PAUSE Now take a moment to listen. What sounds do you hear in this beautiful new surrounding? Can you hear birds chirping in the woods? Do you hear the ocean waves in their perpetual booming rhythm? Per - haps there is music from an ancient flute in the background. Or maybe you hear the voice of an old friend that soothes and calms you. Whatever you hear, take a moment now to enjoy listening to it. PAUSE You can stay in this scene as long as you want to, enjoying this moment of relaxation you have taken for yourself. Feel free to walk around in this special place as long as you want. It is yours. You can change the scene as you wish. Remember that this special place is always here for you. You can come back to it whenever you wish. You need not be afraid to lose it. It is always with you. And the relaxation that you feel right now, at this moment in your body, is yours to call on anytime you wish. When you are ready, slowly let the scene before you dissolve back into your mind. Allow yourself to slowly come back to the comfortable darkness that was there before you imagined your special place. When you are ready, you can slowly open your eyes and come back to this moment, this time, this reality. Before you get up, take a moment to note how relaxed you feel right now. Then, slowly, move on with your daily life. Active Relaxation Tip #3: Enjoy Saunas or Steam Baths Saunas or steam baths have proven very effective in reducing the stress response and creating balance in the autonomic nervous system. They improve circulation, help with weight loss, balance blood sugar, and improve detoxification—each of which improves your brain function. Saunas have also been shown to reduce complications and improve cardiac performance in heart disease patients. When the autonomic nervous system is in chronic stress mode, the heartbeat becomes less variable. Normally, there is a subtle variability between beats. If there is more variability in the beat-to-beat rhythm, your heart and nervous system are healthier. The least healthy heart rhythm has the least variability—a flat line. As you may remember from The UltraMind Solution , the health and resilience of your brain function are directly related to the complexity and variability of your heart rate. What is good for your heart is good for you brain. And since saunas and steam baths increase the variability and health of your nervous system, that means they are a great way to improve brain function. To take a sauna or steam bath, use the following guidelines: ✣ Find a local sauna to use. ✣ Start slowly, with 5 to 10 minutes per session. ✣ Build up to 30 minutes with cool-down periods in between. ✣ Keep well hydrated during the sessions—bring a glass bottle of water into the sauna or steam room with you."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"142 Relax More Deeply ✣ Be sure to take a good multimineral while doing the sauna treatments (if you are not doing so already) to replace the minerals lost through sweating. ✣ Wash thoroughly with soap after the steam or sauna to remove the toxins from your skin ✣ Consider purchasing an infrared sauna ( www.sunlightsaunas.com ) for home use. ————— Other Tools You Can Use to Help You Relax ————— In addition to the techniques above, there are a number of technological devices now available that can help you train yourself to relax. These include biofeedback systems that help you control bodily processes that are normally involuntary, as well as heart rate variability monitors that help you track and improve your heart rate variability. In the Resources section of this guide, I give a complete list of these tools. Use them in addition to the techniques above to relax even more deeply. It’s easy to convince yourself that you don’t have time to relax. This is a major mistake. If you don’t relax, your body and mind will suffer. Consider this: We only live this life once. If you don’t enjoy your life now, when will you enjoy it? All of us make time for our jobs, our families, and all our other responsibilities. Why not take some time for yourself? Relax. It will help your mind and your body fix themselves."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"S E C T I O N 1 0 : —————————————————— SUPPLEMENTS: WHAT, WHEN, AND HOW MUCH TO TAKE ——————— S ome doctors will tell you that supplements just make expensive urine. Nothing could be further from the truth. Vitamins and minerals are the cofactors or coenzymes that make virtually every biochemical process in your body function. Today, more than 92 percent of Americans are deficient in at least one vitamin or mineral. That doesn’t mean they receive less than the amount needed for optimal health; it means they receive less than they need to avoid deficiency diseases like rickets or scurvy. I have watched so many of my patients help their bodies fix themselves by taking a few supplements. That’s why I recommend the use of supplements for everyone. However, I am also aware that taking so many different supplements to promote the balance of so many different parts of your biochemistry can quickly become confusing. That’s why I created the two supplement charts below. SUPPLEMENT CHART #1: The first chart includes all the basic supplements you need for lifelong health. Every single one of you should take these basic supplements every day for the rest of your life. SUPPLEMENT CHART #2: In the second chart, you will find supplements divided by the key they are used to optimize. You can use these supplements to support balance in your key systems. The supplements in the second chart are THE MOST IMPORTANT supplements you need to take to balance each key. For some keys you may not need to take ALL of the supplements outlined in The Ultra - Mind Solution to optimize function. In cases where supplements are only necessary under special conditions, I have placed them in the “Additional Supplements” chart at the end of this section. After taking your quizzes, if you qualify for Self Care or Medical Care in any of the keys, I recommend focusing on the core supplements outlined in Supplement Chart #2 for the 6-week program. If you don’t experience the level of support you expect during the program; if you know you need cer - tain types of additional support; or if you are simply interested in trying some of the Additional Supplements, you may add these to your program as well and take them as indicated. Please use the instructions in Part IV of The UltraMind Solution to integrate all of the supplements you take. All of the charts are organized as follows: ✣ Type —In the “Type” column on the left, you will find the type of supplement I recommend you take (multivitamin/mineral, calcium/magnesium, etc.) ✣ Brand —In the “Brand Name” column, you will find the specific brand of supplement I suggest.

The brands I recommend are from compa - nies that have risen above the pack and are at the top of their field in terms of the manufacturing practices they use."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"144 Supplements: What, When, and How Much to Take ✣ Product Name —The next column is the “Product Name,” which simply tells you exactly what each company calls its specific product. ✣ Amount —Finally, in the column on the right, you will find “Amount,” or the number of cap - sules you should take of each supplement. This will cover all your needs and you won’t have to worry about the exact number of milligrams you are taking. If you want to use these charts as checklists, you can. I have included a box on the far right for you to check off the supplements as you take them. If you choose to use them this way, you will need to make cop - ies of these checklists for every day you are on the program. Then simply check off your supplements as you go to keep track of each supplement you are taking, along with the amount and when you should take them. ————— Special Notes for Taking Supplements ————— When taking all these supplements, there are a few important things to keep in mind: 1. The amounts outlined are the MAXIMUM total daily amount I recommend taking without a doctor’s supervision (with the exception of vitamin D). For example, if you are getting B12 from several sources (your multivitamin and a separate B12 tablet), the total you should take every day from all sources is 1,000 mcg—no more. This is true of EACH of the amount recommendations below, so please be careful about how much you take. 2. Generally, take all your vitamins with food—optimally with the meal or just before (unless oth - erwise indicated). People who take them after a meal may find that the vitamins just sit on top of their food and upset their stomachs. If you still have an upset stomach when taking your supple - ments, find a doctor who can help to correct any digestive problems, which are often the source of intolerance. 3. Take fish oil just before meals to prevent any fish taste from coming up. Or keep the bottle of fish oil capsules in the freezer so that the capsule will have time to reach your intestine before it dissolves.

However, the other 20 percent of you may need further care. If you don’t experience the level of optimization you expect following The UltraMind Solution and the Self Care plan in Part IV of the book, then you may need some laboratory tests and medical treatment. I outlined the primary tests I recommend and some of the treatments you might pursue with your doctor in the book. Here I would like to give you a more comprehensive list of tests and treatment options that are available to you when you work with a doctor. Understanding what to ask for will help you advocate for yourself in your doctor’s office and the broader medical setting. To do the tests recommended here and get the care you need, you will most likely have to find an ex - perienced practitioner of Functional Medicine or Integrative Medicine. Most conventional doctors simply will not give you these tests. I offer some recommendations on places to find practitioners of Functional and Integrative Medicine in the Resources section. You can also visit our team at The UltraWellness Center in Lenox, MA ( www.ultrawellnesscenter. com ). Please see our website for more information ( www.ultrawellnesscenter.com ) or call us at (413) 637- 9991. Physician visits must be done in person. Nutrition consultations can be done by phone. We also of - fer two discounted special, month-long healing programs: Achieving UltraWellness and Achieving an UltraMind. These can be done in person or through phone consultations. Most tests I recommend in my practice are available through conventional large commercial labs such as Quest Diagnostics or LabCorp. Others are small specialty labs that specialize in metabolic, immune, nu - tritional, or functional testing. After each test discussed below, I have given recommendations on which lab to use to obtain the test. There is still great controversy in conventional medicine circles about the utility of these laboratory tests, but I have used these successfully for more than 20 years in treating patients. I have used these tests on thousands of patients to help me navigate this new medical territory with great success. Rather than provide on or off type of diagnoses—you have this or you don’t—they provide a picture of where you are on the continuum from optimal health to full-blown disease. Rather, many of these tests identify disturbances in function, not pathology. In other words, you might not have anemia from lack of folate, but you might have any number of important pathways that are jammed because you don’t have enough folate for you. The tests I recommend often can help me identify patterns and guide me in choosing the best therapies to help my patients achieve optimal health. I think they can help you and your doctor the same way."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"158 Testing Guide: Information You and Your Doctor Need While testing isn’t always necessary, it can be very helpful in homing in on specific imbalances in your biochemistry that are creating problems for you. If you are still severely out of balance in certain keys or don’t have the health-optimizing experience you expect using The UltraMind Solution, share the information below with your doctor and see if together you can work through the problems in your body that are plaguing your mind. ————— Key #1: Optimize Nutrition ————— Methylation Testing (B6, B12, and Folate Insufficiencies) Complete Blood Count Quest Diagnostics or LabCorp Large red blood cells or anemia might provide a clue. Check the MCV or mean corpuscular volume (the size of the red blood cells). If the MCV is greater than 95, you might have a methylation problem. Homocysteine Quest Diagnostics or LabCorp This is one of the most important tests you can ask for. The ideal level is between 6 and 8 umol/l (mi - cromoles/liter). Serum or Urinary Methylmalonic Acid Quest Diagnostics or LabCorp This is more specific for B12 insufficiency and may be elevated even with a normal serum B12 level (which is very poor at picking up anything other than severe B12 deficiency) or homocysteine. Vitamin D Testing Quest Diagnostics, LabCorp, or Genova Diagnostics Get tested for 25 OH vitamin D. The current ranges for normal are 25–137 nmol/L or 10–55 ng/ml. These are fine if you don’t want to get rickets, but not for optimal health. The range should be 100–160 nmol/L or 40–65 ng/ml. In the future, we may even raise this “optimal” level further. In fact, I like my pa - tients to be between 60–80 ng/ml. Monitor your vitamin D status until you are in the optimal range. If you are taking high doses (10,000 units a day), your doctor must check your calcium, phosphorous, and parathyroid hormone levels every three months."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"159 Testing Guide: Information You and Your Doctor Need Magnesium Testing Quest Diagnostics, LabCorp, or Genova Diagnostics Serum magnesium is most often used, but rarely helpful. Levels of less than 2.0 can be significant. Red blood cell magnesium is more accurate, but if you have symptoms of magnesium deficiency, the best way to know if it will help is to try taking magnesium and see how you feel. Zinc Testing Quest Diagnostics, LabCorp, or Genova Diagnostics The zinc taste test using liquid zinc sulfate can be very accurate in picking up subtle zinc deficiency. (See Resources section for how to get this.) To take the test, simply swish about 2 tablespoons of liquid zinc sulfate in your mouth for a minute or two. It should taste horrible. If you immediately taste something bad, metallic, or bitter, then you are okay. If you taste nothing or have a delayed taste, then you are likely zinc deficient. You can swallow it or spit it out when you are done. WBC or RBC or plasma zinc levels can also be useful. Alkaline phosphatase is a common blood test looking for liver or bone disease. It is an enzyme that de - pends on zinc; if it is low, it indicates zinc deficiency. Most doctors only pay attention to high numbers, but if it is low (less than 70 U/L), you likely need more zinc. Selenium Testing Quest Diagnostics or LabCorp Serum selenium level should be 60 to 160 micrograms/liter. Deficiency is associated with lower cogni - tive function and many other illnesses. Essential Fatty Acid Testing Metametrix or Genova Diagostics It may be useful to test red blood cell fatty acid levels to look for the proper balance of fats, especially low levels of omega-3 fats and high levels of omega-6 fats. This test can identify essential fatty acid deficiencies as well as excesses of inflammatory fats and trans fats. Urinary Amino Acids and Plasma Amino Acids Metametrix or Genova Diagostics Amino acids can be measured in the blood or urine and can be a helpful guide in nutritional supple - mentation and supporting amino acid metabolism. Red Blood Cell Minerals Metametrix or Genova Diagostics Mineral status is a critical part of nutritional health. This can identify deficiencies or imbalances in many minerals."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"160 Testing Guide: Information You and Your Doctor Need OAT (Organic Acid Test): Urine Organic Acids Metametrix or Genova Diagostics Organic acids are byproducts of metabolism.

The key is to look at your symptoms and your blood tests, and then decide. Doctors typically diagnose thyroid problems by testing your TSH levels and sometimes your free T4 level. But some doctors and clinicians have brought the normal levels of those tests into question."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"161 Testing Guide: Information You and Your Doctor Need The diagnosis of “subclinical” hypothyroidism depends on having a thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level over 5 and lower than 10. But new guidelines from the American College of Endocrinologists suggest that anything over 3 is abnormal. This number is an improvement but still may miss many people who have normal tests and a malfunctioning thyroid system. To get a complete picture, I recommend looking at a wider range of function: ✣ TSH (ideal is between 1 and 2). ✣ Testing for free T4 (ideal level is 1 to 1.4 ng/dl) AND free T3 (ideal level is 300–400 pg/dL), which are the inactive and the active hormones. ✣ Thyroid antibodies (TPO) or autoimmune thyroid antibodies. Most doctors don’t check this UNLESS the TSH is high. This is a big mistake. Many people have autoimmunity against their thyroid, which makes it function poorly but still have a “normal” TSH. That’s why I think this should be part of routine screening ✣ Basal body temperature normal temperature is 98.6 degrees F. This is measured with a special basal body thermometer you can obtain at the pharmacy. Check your temperature before get - ting out of bed in the morning. If you are a menstruating woman, check it only between the first and third days of your menstrual cycle (the first day is the first day of bleeding). Additional Testing If the Basic Testing Does Not Provide Clear Answers ✣ Reverse T3 (tests for inactive T3 that is made when you are toxic or sick) ✣ Thyroxine binding globulin ✣ TRH (thyroid releasing hormone) stimulation test for difficult-to-diagnose cases ✣ A 24-hour urine test for free T3 can be helpful in hard-to-diagnose situations Testing for Sex Hormone Imbalances Testing for sex hormone imbalances in women is tricky because levels change all throughout the men - strual cycle. Postmenopausal testing is easier. The best time to test for hormones in premenopausal women is anywhere between days 18 to 23 of the menstrual cycle. For postmenopausal women, any time is fine. Hormone testing is essential to monitor the effects of bio-identical hormone replacement. Women’s Hormone Testing (blood) Quest Diagnostics, LabCorp, or Genova Diagnostics 1.

DHEA-S Note that saliva testing is an accurate, noninvasive way of measuring sex hormones levels and can be used to measure variations over time by measuring at different times of the menstrual cycle. ————— Key #3: Support Your Immune System ————— High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP) Quest Diagnostics, LabCorp, or Genova Diagnostics This is the best test for inflammation. It measures the general level of inflammation, but does not tell you where it is from. The most common reason for an elevated C-reactive protein is metabolic syndrome or insulin resistance. The second most common is some sort of reaction to food—either a sensitivity, a true allergy, or an autoim - mune reaction as occurs with gluten. It can also indicate hidden infections. There are a few special tests noted below to help identify food problems and gluten reactions. One cau - tion about C-reactive protein: If it is high, you can be sure you are inflamed (and high is anything over 1.0), but if it is normal, you can’t be 100 percent sure there isn’t some smoldering inflammation somewhere. (If only medicine were an exact science!) Gluten Allergy/Celiac Disease Testing Quest Diagnostics, Immuno Laboratories, LabCorp, Prometheus Labs, or Genova Diagnostics All these tests help identify various forms of allergies or sensitivities to gluten or wheat. The diagnosis can sometimes be difficult. You may want to refer your doctor to an important review paper, “Narrative Review: Celiac Disease: Understanding a Complex Autoimmune Disorder,” by Armin Alaedini, PhD, and Peter H. R. Green, MD, from Cornell and Columbia Universities. It sheds light on how best to diagnosis this common condition that shows up in many ways, but is often overlooked. Below are the most common blood tests used to identify this problem, which can cause a host of inflam - matory diseases, from autoimmune diseases to obesity, dementia, and even cancer. ✣ IgA antigliadin antibodies ✣ IgG antigliadin antibodies ✣ IgA antiendomysial antibodies ✣ Tissue transglutaminase antibody (IgA; IgG in questionable cases) ✣ Stool antigliadin IgA and tTG ✣ HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 genotyping (gene testing for the celiac or gluten-sensitivity gene)"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"163 Testing Guide: Information You and Your Doctor Need IgG Food Sensitivity (Special Antibodies Tests Against Food) Immuno Laboratories or Genova Diagnostics While still controversial, well-controlled studies have shown these tests to be helpful in identifying prob - lem foods. Removing these foods helps inflammatory problems. I have found these tests to be imperfect though helpful guides in locating trouble foods. ELISA/RAST IgE (Testing for Mold and Environmental Allergies) Quest Diagnostics, LabCorp, Immuno Laboratories, or Genova Diagnostics This is the classic allergy blood test done by allergists for acute allergies. However, chronic mold expo - sure and allergies, particularly from a sick building, is a growing problem that leads to inflammation and ill health. You can measure mold antibodies and mold toxin antibodies that tell you if you have been exposed and if your immune system is aggravated by the mold. Hidden Infections You can have a chronic, smoldering infection that leads to an activation of your immune system and promotes systemwide inflammation. If inflammation persists despite changing your diet and lifestyle, tak - ing supplements, and addressing food allergies and insulin resistance, then you may have a hidden infection. There are many tests that identify hidden infections. Here are the basic options for testing. Specific tests vary based on the bugs and where they are. ✣ Antibody Testing (Quest Diagnositcs, LabCorp, Medical Diagnostics Laboratory (MDL), or Genova Diagnostics) ✣ PCR (Genetic Testing for Organisms) (Quest Diagnositcs, LabCorp, or Medical Diagnostics Laboratory (MDL)) ✣ Cultures of Stool or Urine (Quest Diagnositcs, LabCorp, or Medical Diagnostics Laboratory (MDL)) ✣ Metabolic Markers of Microbes that Can be Found in Urine (OAT test) (Metametrix or Genova Diagnostics) ✣ Metabolic Markers of Microbes that Can be Found in Breath (hydrogen breath testing) (Genova Diagnostics) Here are the most common hidden infections: ✣ Viruses (herpes family, including EBV, CMV, HHV6, HSV I, and HSV II; measles; HIV; and Bornavirus) ✣ Bacteria—mostly Helicobacter pylori (found in the stomach) and abnormal overgrowth in the gut ✣ Yeast—often as overgrowth in the gut ✣ Parasites and worms—often in the gut ✣ Atypical infections (Lyme disease, tick-borne diseases, Lyme co-infections, Mycoplasma, Chla - mydia, Ureaplasma) IgeneX is a lab specializing in tick borne infections"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"164 Testing Guide: Information You and Your Doctor Need ————— Key #4: Optimize Your Digestion ————— General Gut Health, Bacterial Balance, and Parasite Testing Stool Analysis for Dysbiosis Metametrix, Genova Diagnostics, or Doctor’s Data Many chemical markers in the stool can be analyzed to give a picture of the ecosystem. Markers for di - gestion, absorption, acid-alkaline balance, as well as cultures of the various bacteria, yeasts, or parasites can of - ten pinpoint the sources of inflammation and be linked to many diseases. Some conventional labs do test for parasites but are often not experienced and miss many infections. Newer tests even assess the DNA through PCR testing of the entire gut ecosystem and can identify the balance of good and bad bugs in the gut. Urine Organic Acid Test (OAT) for Bacterial and Yeast Metabolites Metametrix or Genova Diagnostics Organic acids are metabolites in the urine that can give clues to nutritional status, but the organic acid test is often used to look at unusual chemicals that come from the gut, such as bacteria, yeasts, or parasites. The test can be helpful in identifying problems and tracking treatment, but even a negative test doesn’t rule out significant imbalances in the gut. We can now only measure some of the activity, not all of it yet. Urinary Peptides Genova Diagnostics Checking for odd molecules that come from partially digested gluten and dairy can be helpful and a motivating factor for removing these brain-twisting foods from your diet, even if you are not allergic. Conventional Tests for Causes of Acid Reflux Quest Diagnostics, LabCorp, Prometheus, or Genova Diagnostics To properly diagnose the causes of acid reflux, you may need to do the following: 1. Get an H. pylori blood antibody test or stool antigen test. 2. Get a hydrogen breath test to check for active H. pylori infection. If you don’t get better with the suggestions below, consider getting an upper endoscopy or upper GI series X-ray to see if there is anything else wrong. Specialty Tests for Causes of Acid Reflux To properly diagnose the causes of acid reflux, you may need to do the following: 1. Consider a test for IgG food allergies (Immuno Laboratories) 2. Consider a test for celiac disease (Quest Diagnostics or LabCorp). 3. Get a breath test to check for small bowel bacterial overgrowth (Genova Diagnostics). 4. Get a urine organic acid test to check for small bowel bacterial overgrowth or yeast overgrowth. (Metametrix or Genova Diagnostics)"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"165 Testing Guide: Information You and Your Doctor Need ————— Key #5: Enhance Detoxification ————— Genetic Testing for Detoxification Capacity or Weakness Genova Diagnostics Detoxification SNPs can be evaluated. SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) are variations in your genetic code. Testing for detoxification SNPs can help identify specific areas of strength and weakness in your ability to detoxify certain substances. Your detoxification system has two phases. The first phase gets toxins ready for processing by the second phase, which then packages up the toxins and ships them out to the urine or bile and stool. There can be problems with each phase. Common problematic genes include those for phase 1 enzymes such as CYP 1A1, CYP 1B1, etc., and phase 2 enzymes such as COMT, NAT, GSTM1, GSTP1, etc. These can be helpful to understand people’s weak areas in detoxification. Then dietary, lifestyle, and supplement support can be prescribed to match the individual and reduce his or her risk. New research shows that people with certain weak enzymes are more susceptible to the effects of toxins. How Is Your Detox System Functioning? The Detoxification Challenge Test This innovative test acts like a stress test for the liver. After taking a dose of caffeine, aspirin, and acet - aminophen, saliva, urine, and blood samples are collected to measure how your liver processes these chemi - cals. They go through specific phase 1 and phase 2 detoxification pathways. If there is a problem, it will likely be picked up, and then specific nutrients, foods, or herbs that promote the healthy functioning of those pathways can be prescribed. This needs to be done by a physician experienced in Integrative or Functional Medicine. Measurement of Detoxification Enzymes and Molecules There are several tests that can measure levels of detoxification enzymes and molecules in your body. These tests can explain several things about how your detoxification system is functioning. Glutathione Genova Diagnostics As you know, glutathione is the main and final detoxifier and antioxidant in the body. It can be measured in the blood. Low levels are found in nearly all chronic illnesses and indicate a toxic overload and inability to protect yourself against oxidative stress. Glutathione Peroxidase Genova Diagnostics This critical enzyme necessary for recycling our glutathione is dependent on selenium. This is why se - lenium has been shown to prevent cancer. It aids in our detoxification system. The activity of this enzyme can be measured in a blood test. Low levels of this is a very strong predictor of heart attacks."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"166 Testing Guide: Information You and Your Doctor Need SOD (Super Oxide Dismutase) Genova Diagnostics This is a critical enzyme necessary for neutralization of super oxide anion, a potent free radical. Low levels of this enzyme have been found in ALS and Down syndrome patients and account for an inability to protect us from toxins and oxidative stress. This enzyme requires zinc, copper, and manganese for proper functioning. Deficiencies in any of these nutrients can lead to problems with this critical enzyme. Low levels of this enzyme indicate problems with oxidative stress and increased toxic overload. Urinary Organic Acids Metametrix or Genova Diagnostics Specific compounds can be measured, including sulfates, pyroglutamate, orotate, and others that can give clues to problems with detoxification pathways. This can be useful for anyone scoring high on the detoxi - fication quiz. Heavy-Metal Testing Doctor’s Data (DDI) or Genova Diagnostics These tests can be critical in identifying heavy-metal poisoning. If you are concerned about heavy met - als, you should find a doctor of Functional Medicine and have these tests performed. If you have many amal - gam fillings, regularly consume seafood, get flu vaccines, or live in an area close to coal-burning industrial plants or medical incinerators, then you should be tested for mercury and other heavy metals. Whole Blood or Red Blood Cell Heavy-Metal Levels: Lead, Mercury, Arsenic, Etc. Doctors Data, Metametrix, or Genova Diagnostics Even though this is the test used by conventional doctors to screen for metals, it is ONLY accurate in picking up very recent exposure (the last 120 days) because most of the toxic metals are cleared quickly from your bloodstream and are stored in your tissues and bones for decades. Hair Analysis Doctor’s Data This test can identify most heavy metals quite accurately. Hair samples have shown that Andrew Jackson had toxic levels of lead from buckshot and mercury from a19 th -century remedy called calomel, and that Napoleon had arsenic toxicity from chronically poisoned wine. Note that mercury from dental fillings will NOT generally show up in hair analysis. It mostly picks up methylmercury, which comes from fish consumption. Chelation Challenge Doctor’s Data or Genova Diagnostics The chelation challenge test can often better identify the level of heavy metals than any other test. An FDA-approved chemical chelation agent called DMSA (challenge dose is 30mg/kg) can be used to mobilize the metals that are found in a 24-hour urine sample that is collected and sent to the lab. DMPS, sold over the counter in Germany and used widely in Europe and Russia, is another well-used chelating agent that can be used for testing or treatment. The challenge dose is 250 mg for children and 500 mg for adults. It is not FDA approved but is legally available from compounding pharmacies in the United States."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"167 Testing Guide: Information You and Your Doctor Need Urinary Porphyrins Testing Metametrix These are by-products of damaged hemoglobin molecules. They can be helpful to identify if your body has had damage done by heavy-metal toxins, especially mercury. I use this to see how severely someone is affected by the mercury in his or her body and to help me know when someone has completed the detoxi - fication process because the effects on porphyrins are gone. Toxin Exposure Metametrix Urinary D-glucarate can be used to assess exposure to industrial toxins or xenobiotics. This is available on organic acid testing. Chemical Testing I rarely perform chemical tests because I assume nearly everyone has some degree of chemical toxic - ity. Body burden studies have been done through the Environmental Working Group ( www.ewg.org ) and the Centers for Disease Control ( www.cdc.gov/exposurereport ) and have found hundreds of chemicals in everyone. For more serious or acute exposures, certain tests that identify the following chemicals can be helpful: ✣ Chemical antibodies to various toxins and metals can occasionally be useful. ✣ Organophosphates can be identified through a 24-hour urine collection. ✣ Organochlorine residues can be identified through a fat biopsy. This is used mostly for research purposes, but certain labs process clinical specimens. ✣ Urinary trimellitic anhydrides (TMA) can be used to assess exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs). ————— Key #6: Boost Energy Metabolism ————— As you know from The UltraMind Solution, oxidative stress is one of the primary factors that jeopardizes your body’s ability to create energy. Unfortunately, there is no perfect clinical test for oxidative stress. Many of the tests available are used mostly for research, although they are becoming more available to the health care consumer. They need to be interpreted by someone experienced in dealing with oxidative stress. With that caveat, here are some of the indicators of oxidative stress now in use and available (although perhaps only at spe - cialty laboratories) for your doctor to order. The tests for mitochondrial function and oxidative stress are not generally performed by conventional doctors or by conventional labs. These are the two main tests I use for assessing oxidative stress:"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"168 Testing Guide: Information You and Your Doctor Need Damaged DNA By-products Metametrix or Genova Diagnostics ✣ 8 OHDG or 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine found in the urine. This test is usually done by spe - cialized labs. This indicates the presence of oxidized or damaged DNA and is closely connected to neurologic diseases. Lipid peroxide Assays in Urine or Serum or TBARS Metametrix or Genova Diagnostics ✣ Indicators of rancid or oxidized fat in the body, especially the fats from our cell membranes. This is an excellent indicator of oxidative stress. Additional Helpful Tests (Advanced Specialty Testing for Oxidative Stress) Genova Diagnostics The tests for the following chemicals can also be helpful in some cases in assessing the level of oxidative stress and monitoring the response to treatment: ✣ Whole Blood or Intracellular Glutathione and Reduced Glutathione ✣ Antioxidant Enzyme Assays • Super oxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx), and catalase ✣ Urinary Hydroxyl Markers • Including catechol and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate measured after an aspirin and acetaminophen challenge ✣ Assessment of Iron Overload (Quest Diagnostics or LabCorp) • Hemachromatosis or iron storage disease is the most commonly inherited genetic disorder in the Northern Hemisphere. A blood test for transferrin saturation, ferritin, serum iron, and total iron binding capacity is the best test for this. ✣ Blood tests for the following antioxidants levels can be occasionally helpful, including • Vitamin A, vitamin E, coenzyme Q10, and beta-carotene (Metametrix or Genova Diagnos - tics) Specialty Testing for Mitochondrial Function While the tests above cover many general factors that affect your energy production, the following tests focus specifically on mitochondrial function and can be important in cases where this is a potential problem. Urine Organic Acids Test (OAT) Metametrix or Genova Diagnostics The body produces many by-products of metabolism. We can measure these in the urine after the body excretes them. They can identify metabolic weak spots or deficiencies. They are a great way to look at the function of mitochondria. With them, we can see how fats and carbohydrates are processed through the mitochondria, and even how well the mitochondria make energy. If there are steps in your energy production system that are not functioning properly, we can identify the step and the exact nutrient, cofactor, or amino acid necessary to correct the problem."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"169 Testing Guide: Information You and Your Doctor Need For example, if you have trouble getting fats into your cells for energy, we know you may need more carnitine, an amino acid that transports fats into the cells. Then we can prescribe that carnitine to help over - come the problem. This is an overnight urine test. Cardiometabolic Stress Testing: VO2max This is a special cardiac stress test that measures how much oxygen you can consume or burn per minute. It is directly related to your mitochondrial function and your fitness level. The lower the level, the higher your risk of death. This test is often only available from specialists in exercise physiology, although I think it is an excellent way to learn about the mitochondria and monitor fitness levels and improvement in function. ————— Key #7: Calm Your Mind ————— An Adrenal Stress Index DiagnosTechs or Genova Diagnostics This is a measure of four separate saliva tests for cortisol at four different times of the day. A number of labs perform this test, which helps you identify if your stress response is still functioning normally, if you are on overdrive, or if you are burned out. Each finding may require different treatment. DHEA: Cortisol Ratio DiagnosTechs or Genova Diagnostics With stress or as you age, the stress-reducing hormone produced in your adrenal glands, DHEA, goes down, while cortisol goes up. A low DHEA-to-cortisol ratio is a good indicator that you are overstressed and need to rigorously apply my recommendations for finding the pause button, which will raise your DHEA and lower your cortisol. IGF-1 Quest Diagnostics, LabCorp, or Genova Diagnostics This is a measure of growth hormone, which goes down whenever stress or cortisol goes up. Growth hormone is important for building muscle and keeping you young. AA-to-EPA Ratio Metametrix or Genova Diagnostics This is the ratio of inflammatory (AA) to anti-inflammatory fats (EPA). The more inflammatory fats and the less anti-inflammatory fats you have in your body, the harder it will be for your body to respond to stress and reduce an overactive stress response."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"170 Testing Guide: Information You and Your Doctor Need Heart Rate Variability When you are stressed, your body and brain are less resilient, flexible, and complex. They get stuck in rigid patterns of function, behavior, and mood. One of the best ways to measure this is the “flexibility” of your heart rate. A small device hooked up to a computer can record very minute changes in your heartbeat from second to second. The more complex and variable your heart rate, the healthier your autonomic nervous system, which controls both the stress response and the pause button. Heart rate variability is something you can change almost instantly by changing your breathing or think - ing. And it can even be measured at home using a simple software program and sensors for your fingers. There are two products that I recommend that are wonderfully effective: ✣ Healing Rhythms by Wild Divine – www.ultramind.com/wilddivine ✣ emWave by HeartMath – www.ultramind.com/heartmath Other Tests These tests are used less often but are still sometimes helpful. 24-Hour Urinary Cortisol Quest Diagnostics, LabCorp, or Genova Diagnostics This is a measure of stress hormone in the urine. When this is very elevated, it is considered a disease (Cushing’s syndrome), but if it is mildly or moderately elevated, it is a great indicator of an overactive stress response. Testing this and finding high levels has been one of the best ways I have found to show people why they can’t lose weight and why they need to relax. ACTH Stimulation Tests (Cortrosyn) Quest Diagnostics or LabCorp This is a test performed in a doctor’s office to measure how well your adrenal glands respond to a com - mand hormone from the brain that normally stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol. If the cor - tisol is low after this stimulation, then your adrenal glands are burned out and unable to respond to stress. Vitamin D Quest Diagnostics, LabCorp, or Genova Diagnostics Vitamin D deficiency can promote an increased stress response in the body.
