We encourage you to make your own healthcare decisions based upon your research and in partnership with a qualified healthcare professional. Charlotte: Thank you for coming. I hope that you will find this an interesting and informative evening. Many of you have heard or know of the Gerson Therapy. What I’d like to begin with today are some (supposedly) new things that have started up. Just in the last couple of days - two, three, four days - you might have heard of the new immuno-stimulating therapy that has been developed by Dr. Rosenburg and others, which is making tremendous waves. It is immediately getting huge applause by the ‘establishment people’ because something new has happened. They are now able to stimulate the immune system, and remember, chemotherapy depresses and damages the immune system, right? They’ve done chemotherapy for 30 years in the treatment of cancer. A good friend just handed me this little excerpt from the Wall Street Journal regarding this new therapy that stimulates the cells into an immune response. Listen to this. The Wall Street Journal says, “This is the first time the immune system has been activated to fight cancer.” Is that true? My father did this 40, 50 years ago. Restoring the body and reactivating the immune system so that the body becomes capable to fight and destroy cancer without toxic side effects has been possible for decades. Listen to this. “It is a very complex treatment, and there is a lot of toxicity. Further, the treatment’s most serious side effect was water retention, causing weight gain and breathing difficulties because of fluid retention in the lungs.” There was also other information that I didn’t immediately see. I didn’t read the whole article, which stated that the treatment is toxic to the liver and causes kidney damage. Again, we are dealing with toxic drugs. It is always my contention, and I’ll continue to state it, that you cannot heal the body with poison. I’d like to define my idea of healing. I think it probably coincides with a lot of yours. When we talk about healing, what we are really saying is that healing is being able to restore the body to total, complete, perfect health. Healing and health go together, don’t they? Healing means restoring"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #1 2 perfect health. Dr. Gerson did that with nutritional metabolic therapy 40, 50, 60 years ago. He was able to return the body to full balance with complete mineralization, complete immune response, complete oxidation, and complete liver function. When all of these things work completely, there can be no disease. The body becomes capable of healing itself again. In other words, as Dr. Gerson stated, you restore the body’s own healing mechanism. His first statement is that in every healthy, normal body, there is a healing mechanism. When people are ill, obviously this mechanism is either not functioning, functioning poorly, under functioning, or whatever. What you need to do is first understand why the healing mechanism isn’t functioning. When you understand that, you can begin to understand the underlying problem, solve it and thereby restore the function, the healing, the immune system, the balances, the proper level of minerals, the enzyme system, the hormone system, the thyroid, the oxidative functions – all of the things that are necessary. So, understanding why the healing mechanism might not be functioning is the first thing I’d like you to keep in mind. Also, healing is not drugging. Healing is not cutting out a piece. Healing is not burning a few cells and leaving the underlying problem to fester. Healing means understanding the total problem, the underlying damage, the depletion, the toxicity, or whatever else, and correcting it. If you do that, away go the symptoms and so-called disease. Now, I’d like to read you something else that I think will shake you up a bit. I’m very happy to be a subscriber to a little newsletter called “The People’s Doctor” that is put out by Dr. Robert Mendelssohn, who is quite well known...he comes out with little gems. In the next-to-last issue, he quotes, among other things, M.D. Anderson’s journal, which is issued by the M.D.Anderson and the American Hospital Tumor Institute of Houston, Texas. In that journal there is the following statement, “In the 1990s, only a few years hence, cancer in children will be accepted as a normal disease of childhood.” This statement, if nothing else, points out to all of us the importance of learning the underlying problem. Why are people are sick? Why are children dying of cancer? What is cancer? How do we prevent it and heal ourselves? The first thing clearly is prevention. You don’t want your children and grandchildren to have cancer; that is a horrible thought. So, we must learn the underlying problem, or cause. We must learn to not just heal those who are already ill but also keep this kind of horrifying prognostication from actually taking place – at least not in those of us that we can reach. So, we must heal, and we must prevent. "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #1 3 So, what is the underlying problem? Dr. Gerson said disease starts in the soil. The foods we eat have to have both the minerals and the enzymes – but particularly the minerals – that our bodies need. I’m told that for a normal, healthy plant to supply our body’s needs, it requires something like 30 to 34 minerals. I’m also told that artificially fertilized foods will only provide 3 to 4 minerals. So clearly, the artificial fertilizers produce mineral-deficient food. When the plants are deficient themselves, then the human body is deficient as well, and it is then attacked by disease. Furthermore, certain things, such as pesticides, pests and rust can cause plant disease. Now, in order for the farmer not to lose his crop from plant disease, what does he do? He sprays. Now, in addition to these plants being planted in artificially fertilized soil, you’ve got insecticides on them. Often this poison will be placed in the soil next to a plant that is already planted, like a potato for instance. And, the potato picks the poison right up. It absorbs the poison, and you can’t wash it off. Often the plants are sprayed when they’re in blossom. Then, the poisons are in the plant and in the fruit. You can’t wash it off. You can’t peel it off. Thus, what we are getting largely, with our commercial growth, is deficient, damaged plants sprayed with toxins. In turn, what we are getting is a deficient, damaged, toxic body. And that’s what will grow cancer. Now, you’ve got to understand that when the body becomes toxic, it begins to lose its ability to properly produce enzymes. You want to also understand that toxins are defined as enzyme inhibitors. It’s interesting to note that about six years after my father died, two researchers, Dixon and Webb, studied a whole group of enzymes and studied how they were produced and what minerals were the enzyme-activators, or the catalysts. He found that in almost all cases, potassium was a catalyst for enzyme production, and he found in almost all cases that sodium, or salt, was an enzyme inhibitor. An enzyme inhibitor is a definition of a poison or toxin. Toxins are enzyme inhibitors. Therefore, salt is a toxin. Salt is poison. Some of you are going to tell me, “But we need salt. The body requires salt.” I say yes, you’re right. But I also say that all the salt you could possibly need is available in your vegetables. They have plenty of what your body needs. The minute you add salt to your food, you’ve exceeded your need. Then, the body is put under pressure to get rid of it. As long as you have plenty of potassium in your system, the body maintains the balance and actually excretes the extra salt and sodium. But, when you begin to become deficient in potassium, and the plants you eat are deficient in potassium as well, and the processing of foods and plants further reduces their potassium levels, and when your sodium intake is gradually increased, you bring the body out of balance. That’s the beginning of disease. Dr. Gerson said loss of potassium from the cell system is the beginning of all chronic disease. We understand that there are several clear things we’ve got to do. Mainly, keep"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #1 4 our potassium intake high and cut out sodium intake. You wouldn’t believe how easy it is, for instance, to overcome the so-called premenstrual syndrome of swollen, painful breasts; severe depression; swollen ankles, and so on by maintaining that balance. We have helped patients overcome these issues who have suffered from them for 30 years. Sometimes, their problems were very severe, including serious depressions. In one case a lady had three times, in her premenstrual syndrome depression, attempted suicide. She was frightened that it might happen again. She just didn’t realize what she was doing. In five days on the Gerson Therapy, she had for the first time in 30 years a perfectly normal menstrual period! If you restore the potassium and get rid of the sodium, then you’ll get rid of the swelling, the edema, and increase the oxidation digestion. Low and behold, the will body function. The problem is that in those 30 years of suffering, she had gone to doctor after doctor and had been given drug after drug, including valium, and hormones, and goodness knows what. And, with all the drugs and additional damage, she had developed breast cancer. That did not go away in four days. That’s the next progression of disease – treating the symptom. Relatively minor symptoms that are not really treated properly, with such orthodox treatments like Valium, hormones, and tranquilizers will not going away; and thus, new diseases will develop. That’s the worse part; treating the symptom is the dangerous thing in orthodox medicine. Once you understand that treating most of the underlying problems is vital, such as getting rid of the sodium, getting potassium back in, getting more nutrients, and getting minerals restored to the body, then you don’t have to treat the symptoms; the balanced body will get rid of these symptoms. Look, for instance, at diabetes. I have some very interesting information about diabetes. In one of our books called “The Health Revolution,” there is information on the diabetes research that was done by Pritikin. It was very clearly evident that underlying problem of diabetes is not a problem of the sugar metabolism. Rather, it’s a problem of the fat metabolism! Would you believe it? When people eat fat, first of all their red blood cells clog and form lumps and clumps. They’re called rouleaux like rolls of coins, and they can no longer carry oxygen properly. Furthermore, there are certain areas in each cell that requires and is a receptor for insulin. In a healthy cell, these receptors can handle the sugar problem and burn sugar into energy. When diabetes actually develops, cholesterol begins to accumulate in the body and starts to block the cell receptors for insulin. Some of you may know that many people who have diabetes have what is called age-onset diabetes, and these people actually have adequate insulin levels in their bloodstream. So why do they have diabetes if they have enough insulin? Because,"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #1 5 this insulin is not getting to the cell receptor. What’s blocking it? Cholesterol. And cholesterol develops because the fat digestive system isn’t functioning correctly. So what’s the answer to diabetes? Meat with protein, and chicken, and eggs, and fish high in fat? No! You want to cut out all fats and all proteins. You want to go on a vegetarian diet with high amounts of potassium and no sodium, so that oxidation digestion can start again and get rid of the clogging cholesterol. Low and behold, the insulin that’s available can become active again because the cell receptors aren’t blocked. The patient no longer needs to shoot any insulin or any of those things. The problems go away. Dr. Gerson’s most famous patient with diabetes was Albert Schweitzer. He came to him at age 75 suffering with diabetes, having been told “Lots of proteins, no carbohydrates. Eat proteins, proteins.” He was depressed and groggy. He couldn’t work. He couldn’t think. He was really not interested in living that way. What did Dr. Gerson do? Same as he did for cancer patients – he recommended eating fresh vegetables, drinking fresh juices, detoxifying the body, and getting the cholesterol out of the system. Usually it takes only a few weeks – three or four weeks – to cut the insulin in half. After another few weeks, the insulin is gone and the body’s own insulin works. That’s healing - getting the body to function again on its own, without drugs. As you may know, Albert Schweitzer lived past the age of 90, and collected a Nobel Prize in the interim. Getting the body back to full and normal function and activity is what we want to do. We do this by understanding the underlying problem. I don’t want to leave the wrong impression. Juvenile diabetes is not the same. Juvenile diabetes is very interesting, but it’s a totally different problem. The ultimate effect is the same – pancreatic damage from a lack of proper insulin production. But the basic underlying cause is completely different. I had a lady ask me one time, “What do we do with a child about 12 years old who has been a diabetic since age 5?” I said, “First, let me guess what happened. Let me see if I can reconstruct your history. When she was two, there, four, or five years old, she had lots of infections and lots of antibiotics?” “Yes,” she said, “she always had infections, always went to the doctor to have them treated, and was always given antibiotics.” I replied, “Then, by the time she was five, she probably one day had a very serious cold or flu that she couldn’t shake.” “Yeah, how did you know?” she asked. I answered, “Because that’s the progression. I’m also guessing that a short time after that serious flu-type infection, she was diagnosed with diabetes, juvenile diabetes.” The mother said, “Yeah, that’s exactly what happened.” You know what really the problem is? Juvenile diabetes usually starts after pancreatitis – when the pancreas is damaged and when, in fact, the islets of Langerhans (which are the cells that produce insulin) are damaged and do not"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #1 6 produce insulin properly. That’s a true diabetic situation. It’s initially caused by a poorly functioning and toxic immune system – one that suffers from colds, flus, and other troubles. Eventually the body is no longer capable of defending itself and the pancreatitis occurs. You don’t reactivate the immune system with this kind of an attack on the body. What am I saying is that the body can’t defend itself. Pancreatitis or hepatitis should never happen. They just should not happen. The pancreas and liver are rich organs, and are thoroughly endowed with immune responses so that they will not develop infections. So, why do they? Because, the immune system is severely weakened. Again, the so-called ridiculo-endothelial system is very highly developed in these organs and protects them from infection. It’s only in very severely damaged, depleted, deficient children that pancreatitis develops. When I was working in South Bend, Indiana, there was a nearby school that had three first grade classes. They had to add an extra teacher because in these three classes, out of maybe 30 to 40 kids, 10 were diabetic. Before a Senate committee in 1976, the US Senate select committee heard testimony from a vast amount of research, showing that each year in the United States, diabetes in children is increasing by six percent. These children have damaged immune systems and poorly functioning bodies. They are poorly functioning not only because of the poor food, but also because children aren’t getting their mother’s milk, which is the only good food for infants. Canned, jarred baby foods should not be consumed. They are ‘dead food’, as Dr. Gerson called them. Masses of dead food do not produce healthy life. So there you have it: the underlying problems of disease are a poorly functioning immune system and a poorly functioning enzyme system. Again, the lack of potassium is the culprit, as potassium is a catalyst for the enzyme system. Again many of these children do not have a functioning immune system. One of the best things that helps restore the immune system is carrot juice, which Dr. Gerson used in the 1920s. But, it’s not just vitamin A. Vitamin A is very important to activate the immune system, but it has been found that it’s not so much the vitamin A but its precursor – beta-carotene. Beta Carotene is, in fact, the activator of the immune system. Dr. Gerson gave the patients five glasses of carrot juice and four glasses of juice made from fresh greens, all high in beta- carotene, which all activated the immune system. He healed the wife of Albert Schweitzer in 1929 or 1930 by giving her these juices. This was before the days of antibiotics. He healed her of advanced lung tuberculosis by restoring and reactivating the immune system with carrot juice and green juice and fresh, live foods and greens. No salt, no fat. "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #1 7 It’s very interesting that just in the last few years, one of the most published researchers in the United States, Dr. Robert Good, formerly head of research at Sloan Kettering, clearly stated that mild protein deprivation helped to react and helped the immune system to respond. Protein deprivation, meaning what? Meaning, you cut out the excess protein. Most Americans suffer from excess protein. Now, you get a lot of researchers and a lot of so-called nutritionists telling you that you need protein, protein, and more protein to rebuild damaged tissue. Most Americans have excess protein and die because of excess protein. The excess protein overloads the pancreas and the digestive systems. Do you know that way back in the first decade, between 1910 and 1914, Dr. Beard found that when adequate pancreatic enzymes were available, there was no cancer in the body? When the pancreas, however, is tied up with lots and lots of protein eating - two eggs and bacon for breakfast with a glass of milk, maybe a hamburger for lunch and a Coca Cola, maybe then a snack in the afternoon and steak or fish for dinner (that’s the normal American diet, right? - vastly excessive in protein and fat), the body cannot handle it. Where is the pancreas going to get all the pancreatic enzymes it needs then, not only to digest this overload of protein, but to protect the body against cancer and all the other problems? Meaning, the pancreatic enzymes will breakdown malignant cells. But, if you use them all up in protein digestion, what’s the body got for reserve? Nothing. That’s another problem of the cancer patient. The reserves are gone. When the potassium is gone, the sodium invades the cells, and the excess protein stimulates the cells to grow excessively. Now, the cell can no longer properly oxidize with oxidative enzymes, and the cell function decreases, producing less energy. This chain of events is called fermentative metabolism. Otto Warburg is who showed this. He won the Nobel Prize twice. Otto Warburg showed that the normal, healthy cell, when it utilizes food, turns it into energy and does so by the oxidative process using oxidative enzymes. But when the cell hasn’t got these enzymes available, and when the proteolytic enzymes from the pancreas are not properly functioning, the cell goes into a lesser lifestyle – the fermentative metabolism. It was shown much later, probably only about ten or so years ago, that the only thing a cell can do with energy derived from the fermentative metabolism is grow and split and grow and split. Otto Warburg showed that that is cancer. Why does each cell in your body need food? Because, each cell in the body has a job to do and each needs ‘food’ to do these jobs. The lung cells work to separate the oxygen, and so on, and put the carbon dioxide back out in the air when you exhale. The muscle cells contract, the heart cells work and contract, the kidneys filter, and so on. Again, every cell in the body has a job to do. In order to do work, you need energy, right? In order to get energy, you eat food. Then, the food is digested, and you breathe air, and the oxygen and the food combine to burn and to"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #1 8 form energy. That’s vastly simplified, but that’s essentially what happens. Well, if that process is blocked anywhere along the road and the enzymes don’t work properly and can’t do their job, then the digestion doesn’t work properly either. If proteins are not digested to the end product, your cells don’t even get them. Then, some strange things begin to happen. For instance, they have found that schizophrenics have poorly digested, strangely structured protein substances in their blood. When these strange protein substances hit the brain, the brain doesn’t work right. You call it mental disease. It’s not! It’s a disease of the protein metabolism, plus adrenaline and other problems involved. Therefore, with the same underlying therapy – with the Gerson Therapy – or, correcting the digestive metabolism, you can heal schizophrenia. Or epilepsy. Epilepsy is caused by improper transport of messages from brain cells. Why is it improper? Because, the enzymes aren’t working right. Maybe there’s scar tissue. Maybe there’s damage. You can get rid of the scar tissue with the Gerson Therapy. Then the function becomes smooth and straight again. Again, the underlying problem, not the symptom, is what you want to treat. The underlying problem is so very similar in every chronic, degenerative disease. I’m not talking about germ diseases or automobile accidents, for which is wonderful. It’s great. It’s absolutely necessary when you break your arm or when you’re in an automobile accident and you’ve got to be sewed up. Or, God forbid, a manufacturing accident in which a machine or something like that cuts off your leg or arm. It’s got to be sewed on, right? But surgery is not the answer for cancer. It’s not even the answer for cataracts. We were using the Gerson Therapy to treat a patient who had melanoma. Now melanoma, as you may know, is one of the most malignant types of cancer known. It spreads very rapidly and becomes very quickly fatal. This patient had a tumor on her shoulder, about the size of a goose egg. They found out it was melanoma so they tried to get it off by surgically removing it. It was so deep down it was touching the tip of the lung. They couldn’t get it all. Well, they sewed her up, shrugged their shoulders and sent her home, figuring there was nothing they could do because she was 71. Before the wound was even completely healed, the tumor was back as bad as it had been, plus it spread to the other side. In addition to having melanoma, this lady had such bad cataracts that she couldn’t read with or without glasses. She couldn’t watch TV. She was virtually blind. She was hard of hearing. She had high blood pressure. She had arthritis. She had all kinds of problems. She received Gerson Therapy to treat the melanoma. Now, it is just about five years later. She’s not only alive, which means the melanoma is gone because you can’t live this long with melanoma growing in your body, but she can read. She has no more cataracts. The cataracts are gone. Her arthritis is gone. Her hearing is vastly improved. The family says"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #1 9 she hears more than she’s supposed to. She has so much energy. She takes care of the family and the kids. She works circles around everybody else. That’s healing. That’s being fully restored. Once you get the body to heal, you cannot heal it selectively. You can’t heal the cancer and keep your cataracts and your arthritis. You can’t heal the heart disease and keep your kidney disease and your sore, whatever it is. When the body heals, it heals totally because you reactivate – restore – the body’s own healing mechanism. Then, we had a patient, a man, who had prostate cancer. He was followed at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The head of oncology there, a very famous man, was interested in the case because it was somewhat unusual. The man was so young – fifty-one. Fifty-one is not a common age for prostate cancer. Along with that, it was discovered he had constant kidney stone attacks. They came every five or six weeks regularly for almost two years. Along with that, he had high blood pressure and was on medication. He also had some arthritis, but not severe. He also had something else much, more serious; he had three herniated discs in his spine. They caused so much pressure that he was in constant pain. Not only that, he had pain in the sciatic nerve, and the sciatic nerve was so compressed that the muscle in his left leg had gone down by almost 50 percent; it had atrophied. He didn’t want to have surgery in his back. He was on full disability and in constant pain, besides suffering from cancer and kidney stones and high blood pressure. He went on the therapy because of the cancer. Now, it’s very interesting to note that with the same therapy, his body was able to destroy and eliminate the cancer. He was reexamined by the same head of oncology and found clear. At the same time, he never had one more kidney stone attack. The therapy dissolved the kidney stones. At the same time, it rebuilt the herniated discs. Two years later, his back was fine, the pain was gone and x-rays showed that the spine was in order. Not only that, the damage to the leg muscle, the atrophy in the leg muscle, was beginning to disappear. The muscle reformed. That’s unheard of. It’s absolutely impossible, except for with the Gerson Therapy. I remember I had him on stage and I was showing him as a recovered patient. I asked him, “So listen, with the x-rays showing your spine rebuilt and with your leg rebuilt, did you lose your disability payment?” So he said, “No. They wouldn’t believe it.” Never mind the cancer. We cured that. They couldn’t believe that you can rebuild herniated discs with the same therapy that dissolved kidney stones. The body does it right. The body knows. The enzymes dissolve the kidney stones, and when you eat right and don’t overdo proteins, you do not build new kidney"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #1 10 stones. There’s none of the deposit because now the kidneys function properly. At the same time, the bones are rebuilt and cancer disappears because the metabolism, the oxidation, is restored. That’s total healing. You can’t do that with a drug, even some of this wonderful stuff they’re coming out with now and talking about – their ability to get the white cells’ immune response to fight the cancer. But, what about the lungs? If you get fluid in your lungs, you can’t breathe anymore. Great. And you get damage to your liver and your kidneys. That’s not healing. What does it do for the heart disease and the high blood pressure? Nothing. But, we get rid of that very easily. High blood pressure doesn’t usually take more than five days to get rid of. That’s a much better alternative than taking drugs and more drugs for the rest of your life. We had a physician who was a patient. He came to us because he had constant cough, called bronchial katar. He had tried every drug there was, he told us. Of course, we weren’t going to give him drugs. We put him on the therapy and got the right nutrients into the body. He healed those irritated, inflamed membranes that were causing this bronchial katar. Sure enough, after five or six days, he didn’t cough anymore. After another couple days more, he was also free of coughing during the day. He could sleep at night and was free during the day. What really puzzled him was that he no longer needed blood pressure medication. His blood pressure was normal. He said if this hadn’t happened to his own body he wouldn’t believe it. He would not have believed it. Every book, every medical doctor at every university, every pathology book, and so on teaches that once you have high blood pressure, you’ve got to be on high blood pressure medication for the rest of your life. It’s not so. When the doctor tells you there’s no cure for this disease and that you’ve got to learn to live with it, that’s not so. We were extremely fortunate quite recently to have had a patient who suffered from ALS, Lou Gehrig’s disease. That’s the toughest problem that you can face. It’s a problem of the central nervous system, the brain. The motor neurons in the brain become atrophied and you lose movement in your tongue. You lose movement in your hands. You lose movement in your arms, your legs. You can’t move, you can’t swallow, and you can’t cough. It is 100 percent fatal. Lou Gehrig died. Senator Jarvis [?] of New York had it. There’s nothing they can do. Don’t you think they have the best doctors? They do, and there is absolutely nothing they can do. Nobody knows what to do. It’s very interesting, though, because we now have evidence (several cases) where the patients have either improved considerably or gotten rid of the disease completely. In one case a man, 42 years old, had lived in an area in Chicago where he was near a copper rolling mill. He said that he remembered during all of his first 21 years when he lived there that he was constantly inhaling sulfur fumes, and possibly some copper fumes. It always smelled like sulfur. It didn’t do him"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #1 11 any good. Then, he moved away from there and for the next 21 years – he’s 42 now – he lived also in the Chicago area, but out in the country a little ways where there was a lot of insecticide spraying. By the time he was 42, he was diagnosed by the University of Chicago as having ALS. He could not move his tongue, which is a typical symptom. He had a hard time swallowing, could hardly speak, and he had very poor enunciation. He could not eat or chew. When you chew, you’ve got to move your tongue and move the food around. He couldn’t move the food; so, he had to have only chopped and semi-liquid food. He had trouble moving his hands. He could not put his feet in front of the other and at age 42, he was told he had two years to live. He came to the clinic in Mexico where the patients go, and he was very thoroughly detoxified. He had coffee enemas, which open up the liver and bile ducts. It’s very interesting that he stated that with the coffee enemas, which began to detoxify his body and clear it of accumulated poisons, his stools smelled like the sulfur that he had inhaled for the first 21 years of his life. He was getting rid of those poisons that where still lodged in his body. He was washing and cleansing. His body smelled of evil all the time. He couldn’t stand himself. He was alone in the room. He woke up one night and said he couldn’t stand his roommate. It was himself. He washed and enema-d and cleansed and cleansed. At the end of three weeks, he was speaking freely and clearly, chewing and eating, and his tongue was moving. His feet were moving. His hands were moving. As a matter of fact, he had so much fun moving his tongue, that he went around sticking his tongue out at everybody. We understood. He loved holding out his hand and shaking everybody’s hand because he hadn’t been able to do it. This is a disease that nobody has been able to touch. I’m almost convinced that it’s caused by the toxins that we get in our air and our water and our food and all the chemicals that are everywhere around us. If the body becomes capable of getting rid of these toxins, you can restore health. Let’s now look at the basics. I’m convinced that the basic underlying healing, for everything, consists of two major areas - detoxifying the body and rebuilding it. You cannot do it with one or the other. You’ve got to do both. It’s like if you have a great big plot of land and it’s muddy and it’s full of water and you want to build a house on it. Clearly the house would sink right down into the gunk. You couldn’t build on it. So, now you drain the land and maybe put some piles on it to strengthen the soil and make it solid and dry. That’s not enough because you don’t have a house yet. Now, you still have to build the house, just like you have to build your body. Remember, toxins are enzyme inhibitors. When the body is full of toxins, it cannot function, as it cannot have the enzyme activity. It cannot oxidize. So, you must detoxify the body intensively."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #1 12 But that’s still not enough. That’s why fasting is not enough. Fasting doesn’t heal. It produces further deficiencies. It doesn’t rebuild. When the body is healing, when it’s clearing the toxins, you then have the long process of rebuilding, of restoring, of bringing in the minerals and the enzymes and vitamins. Now you say, “Why don’t we just take pills?” Because, taking pills doesn’t work. When most people are ill, when they are toxic and the body is damaged, the pills don’t do the job. We have seen with x-rays, patients who have in their systems, in their intestinal tract, bunches of vitamin pills sitting there that they’ve taken eight months ago. They’re still sitting there, un-dissolved, unutilized. Sticking them in your mouth doesn’t mean they go into your cell systems. But, if you eat and drink the freshly prepared, organic, nutrient-rich live food and raw juices, they will be absorbed and to into your cell systems. When the nutrients go into the cell systems, it forces out the sodium and the toxins. Then, the cell systems begin to work, and the organs begin to function and heal. You can’t do this with pills. It’s got to be done with the live, fresh foods that are rich in nutrients from rich, healthy soil. This doesn’t work, though, unless the body is also detoxified. So, how do we do the detoxifying? Dr. Gerson used the research that was done by two professors at the University of Gauting, way back – after World War I. They found that when caffeine is put into the rectum of animals, it travels through the hemorrhoidal vein up to the portal system into the liver. At the point of the liver, the caffeine opens up the liver and bile duct so that the liver is capable of detoxifying. Remember, among its maybe 10,000 functions, one of the functions of the liver is to filter the blood – to get the poisons out of the bloodstream. When you don’t clean the filter what happens? It clogs up. It doesn’t work anymore. If the liver becomes incapable of getting rid of these accumulated poisons, it doesn’t do you any good anymore. We have to open up the liver so that it can let go. When that happens, patients often have very smelly stools, black stools and sometimes they say they can’t stand themselves for a few days. But then, the pain goes. We had a patient who just left the other day. All or her life, from the age of 12 until now (she’s 60), she had not known one day without headaches. She was never without aspirin and Excedrin and all kinds of painkillers. Of course, after a long enough time using painkillers, she first got psoriasis, then a lot of intestinal troubles, then liver troubles, and finally cancer. Within her first 12 hours at the clinic on the Gerson Therapy, she was free of headaches. She couldn’t believe it! That was the first time since she was 12 years of age that she didn’t have a headache. The whole time she was there she was free of headaches. That’s because, when helped, the body knows how to function. It lets go of the poison and its systems begin to work. "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #1 13 The first thing that generally happens is pain relief. The pain disappears. The body lets go of it. The toxin levels go down. The nerves stop screaming. You are no longer poisoned. You can let go of the Tylenol and the morphine and codeine and all the other stuff. With those things, you can’t heal. How can you heal when you have to give a patient Tylenol and codeine and painkillers? You can’t torture them. But we don’t need to. In almost all cases, within the first 36 hours the patients are free of pain. We had a patient who came in only about 14 days ago. He had small cell carcinoma, old-cell cancer, in the lung. People are generally completely helpless with old-cell carcinoma in the lung. And, in his case, the cancer was not only in one place. It had spread to the bronchial area. He was in constant pain. He was constantly coughing. He was on codeine and cough syrup. He said it was like there was no tomorrow. Doctors couldn’t do anything else. They didn’t even want to give him chemo, nothing. He was in such severe pain and was coughing and spitting blood; they didn’t know what to do. He came out to Mexico and took therapy. In 24 hours he stopped coughing, and in 36 hours he had no more pain. He couldn’t believe it himself. No more spitting blood. No more pain. I’m not saying he’s cured yet, far from it. But now the body is beginning to function. He’s not taking any more codeine or any more cough syrup. He doesn’t have to throw any more junk in his body. So now, we can do the detoxifying and the rebuilding. It’s a long, slow process to rebuild a sick, damaged liver. If the liver works and functions, then you are well. It’s only the sick liver, or the damaged liver, that damages the immune system and then causes all the problems to start. The underlying problems of all chronic diseases are the same. That’s why this book, The Gerson Cancer Therapy, describes the therapy, which works for all the other diseases. It activates the body’s healing system. It helps the body to function so that the body can heal itself. Just to help you understand, I’d like to show you a patient. Would you like to come up Sylvia? Sylvia was so entranced she didn’t even know I was talking about her. Sylvia, do you want to tell your story? When were you diagnosed? Sylvia: In April of 1983, Dr. Spivak at the University of California in San Francisco diagnosed me as having lymphoma of the bone marrow – stage four. I had no idea what that meant. I tried to find out, and nobody would tell me what stage four meant. Anyhow, eventually I did find out. When I heard this diagnosis, I was really crushed because nobody in my family, nobody that I knew even, had ever had cancer. "},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #1 14 I went back to my homeopathic doctor, and she handed me “The Cancer Therapy.” I wasn’t even a health enthusiast at the time. She said to me, “Go home and read this book.” That’s exactly what I did. Within two weeks, I called Charlotte Gerson, and I went to Hospital La Gloria. I stayed several weeks. My husband went with me. In seven months, Dr. Spivak at UC Medical Center in San Francisco declared me completely free of cancer. My body kept on healing. I had had arthritis extremely bad two years before I found out I had cancer. It was so bad, in fact, that I couldn’t take a step with my left foot. So I dragged it, like this. The next thing I knew, my spine was out of joint. Look what I can do now. [applause] That’s the first thing that healed. Also, I had been taking Senekot for over 40 years to move my bowels. If I didn’t take my ‘going-stuff’, I didn’t go. I’m still on three or four coffee enemas, but I still go in between. My colon is working. Another thing...when I was a child, I had all the childhood diseases. After I had scarlet fever, I had arrhythmia. My pulse used to go like this [singing] “bump, bump, bumpy-ump-bump, bump, bump, bump- bump-bump.” It was never regular. I have an absolutely regular pulse now. It’s still continuing to heal my body. I’m really pleased and delighted. But that’s not my whole story. After I was well for about a year and a half, my husband and I joined a health club. I did a little aerobics, used the steam room, and sometimes I went swimming (but not very often because we were not allowed in the chlorine). When I was lying in the steam room one time, I was bitten by a poisonous ground recluse spider. I’d never heard of one of those before. My stomach blew up like a watermelon. The homeopathic doctor did all she could. The lesion started to heal but the poisons had gone to my heart, and this hand became paralyzed. I couldn’t lift it to take dishes out of the cupboard. After eight weeks, the doctors said that couldn’t do anything more for me. So, I went back to Hospital La Gloria, and this is what I can do now. I have no more pains in my heart, and I’m really in very excellent condition, probably for the first time in my life. [Applause] Charlotte: Thank you, Sylvia. This is just one of the success stories. I do want to make it clear that grade IV lymphoma means it is beyond all treatment. Grade IV means the cancer has spread all around. Did they offer you any treatment, Sylvia? No, because everybody said it was too late. There wasn’t anything they wanted to do for you. With chemotherapy they said you wouldn’t live one day longer. They really sent you home to die. They basically said go home and wait. Instead Sylvia got well. We will be able to have questions and answers later, but right now we will just have to wind up. We have just a few more minutes. When we are talking then about healing cancer, we are talking about getting to the underlying problems. The underlying problems are long-term damage to the"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #1 15 intestinal tract, long-term liver damage, long-term toxicity accumulating, and therefore, reduction of the immune system, reduction of the oxidizing system and then all of the other things that follow. Obviously, the same thing that we are doing with cancer can be done with the other diseases. Everybody talks a lot about AIDS. Because we cannot take contagious patients at the hospital, I cannot state as fact that we can cure AIDS. But, I know that when you can keep the immune system up, even if in some cases people have been exposed, they do not need to develop the disease. If you can keep the body at a high level of function, you do not need to get the disease. You do not need to die. On the contrary, with some of the extra tools that we have, such as the use of ozone, peroxide, intravenous potassium drip, and clay, as well as some other things and techniques we’ve added to the therapy after Dr. Gerson died (because he said that the therapy was not yet perfect), we can help patients continue to improve. We have to because people are sicker than they used to be. There are more toxins and damage in the ground and the air and everywhere than there used to be. So, we have to work harder. People do not respond quite as quickly as Dr. Gerson described. But we have the results. We have the patients. It’s not 100 percent. So far I haven’t discovered anything yet that’s 100 percent. But it works. People get well of cancer, heart disease, high blood pressure, arthritis, of all these other diseases because we get to the underlying problem. The underlying problem is essentially the same, and we can heal it. Thank you.  [Applause]  Announcer: Thanks for listening to this audio.

Norman: I’d like to introduce Peter Barry Chowka, who is going to be talking about diet and cancer, and the history of the 50-year cover-up. He has been doing some good publicity for it. [Applause] Peter: Thank you, Norman. It’s a pleasure and an honor to be here on the eve of the 100 th anniversary of the birth of Dr. Max Gerson, a very auspicious event in the history of medicine. I think it’s befitting a celebration as we gather here to today. Clearly, if Dr. Gerson’s ideas had been more widely implemented by now, I think we would have seen the cancer problem be not as much of a problem as it is today; 1200 Americans, at least, die from cancer every single day, 365 days a year. Recently I had the opportunity to listen to a four-hour radio interview that Dr. Gerson did in New York City in 1957, 24 years ago. It was rather amazing to hear his calm, but forceful, explanation of his empirical observations on both the cause and non-toxic treatment of disease. In fact, the interview sounded very contemporary as he talked about his whole body approach and the role of diet in disease. It was eerie to hear it too. The tragedy is, again, that the ideas that Dr. Gerson was talking about have not really been tested and implemented as much as they should have been. I think we can take heart though, as obviously is represented by this gathering, that the ideas of Dr. Gerson are now reaching an ever-widening audience. After all, it is the fate of many prophets not to be recognized until after their deaths. Galileo has yet to be exonerated by the church, 348 years after his scientific heresy. Before I get into a brief talk about diet and cancer, I just want to mention something that’s a contrast to the career and the way people like Dr. Gerson and"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" The Gerson Tapes #2 2 other pioneers have been treated through the ages. I live on the east coast of the United States, and right now, there’s a story in the news there, which I think we can contrast to the fate of Dr. Gerson and others. This story involves three young medical doctors who were convicted in a court of law of rape. Let’s see what happened to them. They got suspended sentences, they were out free on personal recognizance during the trial, no bail was required, and their salaries were continued at their hospital three and a half months after the rape conviction. In fact, one of these medical doctors even received what the New York Times has described as glowing letters of recommendation from professors at Harvard University so he could get a new job. These glowing letters of recommendation were written several days after his rape conviction. Following the publicity of the trial and the conviction, it was learned that this one doctor had been accused of raping two other women in their hospital beds three years earlier, but the charges had been covered up. Although, because of the publicity, the charges have now come to the forefront. Again, these three doctors, and the one in particular who is now charged with three rapes, are still free to practice medicine in the state of Massachusetts, despite their convictions. Yet, in California we see medical doctors who have heretical ideas about non-toxic therapies and occasionally, they are sent to prison for those ideas. Briefly, before getting into diet and cancer, I want to look squarely at an overview of the cancer problem. You’ve heard here today many stories on an individual basis about how conventional medicine really hasn’t offered too much to individual patients. Let’s take a broader look at the problem and ask the hard questions. Are we doing better? Is cancer yielding slowly but steadily to our conventional assault? These are fair questions; after all, since during the past ten years, we have spent more on cancer research and treatment than in the entire previous history of medicine all the way back to the beginning. The unpleasant facts are that today, more Americans are getting cancer and dying from cancer than ever before. Even when the statistics are adjusted for the supposed aging of the population and other factors, we find that the cancer death rate rises every year. This year, in fact, 100,000 more Americans will die of cancer than when our cancer war began back in 1971. Cancer’s survival statistics, or the supposed improvement of them, are the basis of our whole national cancer policy. We’re told that 41 percent of cancer patients survive for five years after diagnosis. This is entirely inaccurate because the statistic is based on a small sample of hospitals in states with a higher socio- economic status than the country as a whole. Moreover, the sample does not include black or minority patients. If they were factored in, the situation would be much worse. The real figure of cancer survival for five years is 33 percent. An elaborate statistical game is played with that figure. As an example, every cancer"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" The Gerson Tapes #2 3 patient in that sample who dies of, for instance, a heart attack that’s caused by cancer surgery is subtracted from the sample. This subtraction boosts the overall apparent survival rate. The fact is that we have been throwing money at the cancer problem for the past two decades, during which we have spent at least 20 billion dollars of tax-funded research. We’ve really gotten nowhere. Now to diet and cancer. We know that the health of the individual exists on many levels - body, mind and spirit. But diet and nutrition, I think is a useful focus right now because it seems to be the common ground for most of these so-called non- toxic, or unconventional, or alternative therapies. When looking at diet and cancer, we could, of course, go back further. After all, it was Hippocrates who said, “Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food.” So obviously, the field of diet and disease is an old one. But 50 years is a convenient period, I think, for our purposes. Also, coincidentally, 50 years ago was just about the time that Dr. Max Gerson fled Nazi Germany and came to the United States. I’d like to read you a quotation from a medical doctor, which appeared in a medical journal. Then, we can think about that for a moment. This is a direct quote, “Think back over the years of cancer research, of the millions of dollars spent, the time consumed, the pains expended. Where are we today? Isn’t it time to take stock of our basic concept to see if there isn’t something radically wrong to account for the years of utter and complete failure to date? Cancer has been consistently on the increase. Is it possible that the cause of cancer is our departure from natural foods? It would surely look so to any man from Mars. But we have lived so long on processed foods that we are in a state of unbalanced nutrition from birth. We have come to regard these processed foods as the hallmark of civilization when it is a fact that these very foods set the stage for every sort of ill including cancer.” End quote. This, too, sounds like a very contemporary analysis. It might have been something that you could have heard from this stage today, or something that I could have written myself if I were in an eloquent form of mind. But in fact, it was written by Dr. William Howard Hay and published in the journal “Cancer” in July 1927. So, we see that diet and cancer has been looked at quite seriously for quite a long time, particularly in this century. In fact, it’s always been a quiet but consistent area of scientific inquiry. Beginning 50 years ago at about the time that Dr. Hay was doing his research, diet and cancer became a very vigorous area of inquiry. In 1937 an entire 700-page scientific book was published, titled “Diet and Cancer.” In the 1930s and 40s, there was also the work of Dr. Albert Tannenbaum at Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago. One of the scientific papers that Dr. Tannenbaum published in 1945 with the American Association for the Advancement of Science showed that, in fact, there is an anti-cancer diet. In the introduction to the paper, Dr. Dean Burke, who at that time was with the National"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" The Gerson Tapes #2 4 Cancer Institute (his name may be familiar to many of you), wrote that this work emphasizes the striking carcinogenic influence of dietary fat. Once again, this was written in1945. Most amazing of all, perhaps, was that between 1937 (when it was founded) and 1945, our own National Cancer Institute, which of course now is part of the problem, conducted between one-third and one-half of its own research on cancer and how it relates to diet. So we must ask here, 40 or 50 years later, what happened? What happened to all this diet and cancer research that was going on back then in the 30s and 40s – all of these findings of tremendous positive information relative to human cancer patients? What happened was this: at about the same time, in the 1930s and 40s, medicine was becoming directed, consciously and wittingly, away from the centuries-old traditions of healing into the blind alley of allopathy, or the identification and attack of the symptoms of disease with surgery and pharmaceutical drugs. Meanwhile, other traditions and systems of healing, everything from naturopathy, homeopathy, midwifery, whole-systems approaches, and dietary treatments, were all downplayed and suppressed. At the root of this insidious process, are the drug companies. We’re talking here about a virtual takeover of what was decentralized grassroots healing by a centralized power system that is based on a profit-orientation and has generated a burgeoning scientific bureaucracy that is, today, bigger than ever before. The first thing that this power-grab did was revise the language of how we think about medicine. Today conventional medicine has the nerve to call itself traditional, when in fact, whole-system approaches are derided as alternative or unconventional. In fact, of course, whole-body non-toxic approaches – diet, psychology, environment – are the traditions of medicine, going back centuries. Microscopic, modern, technological, specialty medicine is the aberration in the long history of healing. This is the first thing we have to realize. It’s the first disadvantage we’re at in even discussing the problems in this field. Obviously human biochemisty can be modified by a variety of factors, including non-toxic ones, on the one hand, or drugs on the other. Guess which one is the profitable way to do it? Obviously, drugs. Here is a little more history. In the mid 1800s, the petroleum boom began when oil was discovered. Our civilization changed drastically in every way, including the medical system. Soon after oil was discovered, it was found that coal tar and other byproducts of refining yielded a variety of petrochemical compounds, including drugs. Today most medical drugs are petroleum-based. By the early 1900s with the introduction of drugs into medicine, we saw the narrowing process"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" The Gerson Tapes #2 5 begin. Medicine became the ever more sophisticated identification of symptoms and the treatment of those symptoms with pharmaceutical drugs. This was no accident. The first step, of course, was the takeover of medical education. Hence, today there is very little interest in our medical schools in diet or nutrition and virtually no attention paid to preventing disease. Rather, we have pharmacology, the identification of symptoms and the treatment of symptoms with drugs. Well, guess who began financing medical education early in the century? The drug companies did. They laundered their billions of dollars worth of profits and setup non-profit, tax-exempt foundations to give all this money to the medical schools to setup departments of pharmacology. An example is the Eli Lilly drug company, who setup an Eli Lilly Foundation, which to this point has given 250 million dollars to charitable causes, most of that to medical schools. That’s one drug company alone. Recently it was announced that the Hurst drug company of West Germany is giving a grant of 50 million dollars to Massachusetts General Hospital to do, guess what, drug research. And, 50 million dollars goes a long way. The medical journals became drug journals. Half of the reported income of the Journal of American Medical Association is derived from drug advertising. Hence, nowhere is it mentioned in the medical journals that, for example, there were few, if any, deaths of British soldiers in World War I from infection because they were treated with the use of plain garlic. That natural form of healing doesn’t fit into the drug paradigm. Imagine that the drug industry was non-existent 100 years ago. Today, 50 to 80 percent of American adults swallow at least one medically-prescribed drug every day. A couple of weeks ago, the New York Times described the 1980s as a golden era, saying, “The drug business sees a golden era ahead. It doesn’t matter if there’s inflation or a depression, the drug business is depression-proof.” The New York Times also ran a story about the Warner-Lambert drug company, one of the largest. Their profit was up 76 percent over the same quarter a year earlier. Again, to quote the New York Times, the Squibb drug company was described as having “lackluster earnings.” And yet, those earnings were based on sales of almost two billion dollars that year, 1980, and a profit of 127 million dollars. Yet, when the take is 127 million dollars, the financial analysts say that’s lackluster earnings. The drug industry is expected to generate more than 127 million dollars in profits. The drug companies have maintained themselves and their system way beyond the medical schools. There are payoffs to almost every medical doctor in the United States, with each one receiving an average of 5,000 dollars in gifts and other bribes. In Canada it was recently revealed that 200 million free samples of the tranquilizer Valium were given out, according to the Toronto Globe, and mailed to “win the minds of doctors and control the tranquilizer market.” 200"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" The Gerson Tapes #2 6 million free samples! The result? Valium has become the most prescribed drug in North America. In 1980, according to FDA Commissioner Goyan, 10 to 15 percent of American adults were taking Valium. Another way the drug companies perpetuate their power, are their outrageous advertising budgets, which they can write-off on their tax returns. The average drug company spends 20 to 30 percent of its income on advertising, which is about ten times the normal rate of a non-drug manufacturing concern. Another insidious method practiced by the drug companies is their publication of blacklists of non-toxic approaches. This is a new, revised edition of the American Cancer Society’s blacklist titled “Unproven Methods of Cancer Management,” which lists the leading non-toxic approaches to cancer, including of course, the Gerson Method. The drug companies have their influential friends. For example, between 1977 and ’79, the director of Eli Lilly drug company was George Bush, now vice president of the United States. Recently, President Reagan appointed Armand Hammer to be the new chairman of the National Cancer Advisory Board, which oversees all national cancer policy. He was appointed to a six-year term. Hammer is also the chairman of Occidental Petroleum, which I believe is a holding company for Hooker Chemical. Hooker Chemical gave us the Love Canal, a discovered dumping ground where ‘21,000 tons of toxic waste was buried. Yet, when we look at the record of drug-oriented conventional medicine, we find consistent failure. Recently, a major government study found that fewer than 20 percent of the drugs it reviewed were “effective.” The same study found that of the ten most commonly prescribed drugs, seven of the ten either lacked efficacy or were the second or third choice for their purpose. The other three out of ten drugs were “vastly overused.” Let’s get back to diet and cancer again after that little history lesson about what went on in the 1930s and 40s. Well, in 1974 after about a quarter century of hearing very little about diet and cancer, we started hearing about it again. Here was one of the first articles in the popular press, published in 1974 from the Washington Post titled “Lower Cancer Toll is Found for Mormons in California Study.” The reason of course is that Mormon people tend to eat a slightly different diet than the average American diet, which is a diet of excess and over- nutrition. So of course Mormon people die less frequently of cancer. This was based on a major scientific study at UCLA, by the way. In 1975 there was a major conference on diet and cancer, bringing together many scientists from all over the country. There, Dr. Ernst Wynder of the American Health Foundation said, “It is our prediction that the research area of nutrition will"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" The Gerson Tapes #2 7 turn out to be one of the most fertile fields in the study of human carcinogenesis.” Carcinogenesis means the causes of cancer. Sounds pretty encouraging. At the same conference, Dr. Geo Gorey, who was the head of the National Cancer Institute’s small diet and nutrition cancer program said, “The only risk of recommending a more prudent diet is to the well-being of the industries involved.” He might have added that the risk was to his own career as well because after he made that statement and got involved in this area, he was eliminated from the National Cancer Institute in 1978. In sworn testimony before a Congressional committee, Dr. Arthur Upton, M.D., director of the National Cancer Institute in 1979, said that up to 50 percent of human cancers might be associated with dietary factors. The next year he left the National Cancer Institute. In 1977 the US Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs published “Dietary Goals for the United States,” which in essence presents an anti-cancer, anti-degenerative disease diet – a very moderate, conservative diet, but basically a diet low in fat, low in calories, high in roughage, high in fresh fruits and vegetables and grains, and low in animal products. To show the tremendous influence of the vested interests, the AMA, the Egg Board, the Dairy Council, the Meat Interests, the Sugar Institute, and the Salt Institute all got together and brought pressure on this committee to revise the dietary goals; the publication finally went out of print. Nicholas Mauturn [?], the principle author of “Dietary Goals,” was forced to leave the congressional committee that he was working for when he wrote it. He wanted to publish the follow-up volume, called “Dietary Guidelines,” which actually told the public in plain, simple English how to cook the kinds of foods or prepare the kinds of foods that achieve the dietary goals. But in fact, to this day 76 percent or Americans, according to a recent poll, have never heard of “The Dietary Goals” or “The Dietary Guidelines” because the book is now out of print. After Dr. Gorey, who was the head of the NCI’s Diet and Cancer Program, was forced out, the person who followed him, Dr. Guy Newell, was a man who boasted that he had no training in diet and cancer. After he headed the Diet and Cancer Program, the person who followed him was Dr. Diane Fink, a chemotherapist who retired this summer from the NCI and went to work for the American Cancer Society at a much higher salary. Meanwhile, where are the diet studies that were promised at these conferences in 1974 and ’75? At these conferences, the scientists said that diet and nutrition, as they related to cancer, were areas that perhaps held the most promising hope for decreasing the elevation of cancer. So, where are the follow-up dietary studies? They just don’t exist. Meanwhile, there are studies occurring at places like M.D. Anderson Hospital, that disease-palace in Houston. In fact, right at this moment, there are over 700"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" The Gerson Tapes #2 8 different cancer chemotherapy clinical trials under way, and each of those 700 trials costs well over 100,000 dollars (and in some cases, well over a million dollars). So that’s what we’re talking about. That’s where the money continues to go. The problem is clearly, though, bigger than the drug industry. It involves our entire bloated medical establishment, which this year has a price tag of 245 billion dollars. It’s the second biggest business in North America, bigger than the military industrial complex even. The only thing bigger is food. In fact, I think if we try to visualize the problem in this way, we see that the food and agribusiness industries are involved. Visualize a pyramid for example, with one base being the drug companies, about a 30 or 40 billion dollar a year business. The other base is the food and agribusiness industry, which uses up to 10,000 chemicals and drugs as food additives, fertilizers, and pesticides. At the apex of the pyramid is the medical establishment, which is a 245 billion dollar a year business. It’s an international problem we’re talking about, too. A couple of weeks back there was a public broadcasting TV documentary titled, I believe, “Pills and Pesticides.” There was an interesting segment about the drug Clioquinol, which is an anti-diarrhea drug that has been forbidden to be used in this country. So, you know it’s got to be bad if the FDA finally banned it. Thousands of people were injured in Japan by this drug - paralyzed, put in constant pain, and many of them died. However, the manufacturer of the drug, Ciba-Ciegy of Switzerland, is still marketing it under different names in 13 other countries with 13 different sets of inserts of warning information, contraindications or side effects. In some cases, there are no listings at all of those side effects, depending on the necessity of the country in question. People interviewed on this PBS show said that this instance of drug abuse obviously pointed to a lack of ethics from the pharmaceutical industry as a whole and that this drug could be sold like candy, despite its toxicity, and that the profits represented blood money. Meanwhile, as pointed out on the program, in many of the third world countries where this drug is used as an anti-diarrhea agent, there already exists a traditional medical remedy that involves the use of molasses, salt and boiled water. This remedy works better than the drug, but of course, it doesn’t yield any profit. I think I have a few minutes left in which I’d consider entertaining any questions you might have. Audience: Los Angeles County; Columbia, South America; and Israel are the three major studies when medical doctors went out on strike and withheld their services for a period of time. The death rates during those periods in those three locations fell"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" The Gerson Tapes #2 9 between 25 and 60 percent while the doctors were out on strike. [Laughter] They should go on strike more often maybe. [Applause] Peter: Thank you. In closing I‘d just like to say that a lot of the information is of a negative taint, but I think by trying to learn about it, understand it, grapple with it, and apply the wealth of positive information that does exist, we’ll be able to make a change. Initially we can make a change in our own lives and health, and hopefully, then, in the society as a whole. I’ll be available after if any of you have some more questions. Thank you.

The Gerson Tapes Timeless Interviews with Charlotte Gerson, Colleagues & Patients of The Gerson Institute Transcripts ~ Tape 3 ~"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #3 1 Announcer: Welcome to the Gerson Tapes. These are a unique collection of lectures and testimonials based on the work and research of Dr. Max Gerson, his family and colleagues. So please, sit back and relax and enjoy the great health information you’re about to hear. Please remember, the information contained in this program is not intended to replace a one-on-one relationship with a qualified healthcare professional and is not intended as medical advice. It is intended as a sharing of knowledge and information from the research and experience of the Gerson Institute and its affiliates. We encourage you to make your own healthcare decisions based upon your research and in partnership with a qualified healthcare professional. Charlotte: Thank you all for coming to celebrate Dr. Gerson’s 100 th Anniversary. We are very happy, and in a way I must always say I’m very moved to see that my father, Dr. Gerson, with his deep spirit of healing, seems to reach out beyond the grave; his hands and spirit are helping us heal people today. You will see a number of those on stage and you will see that his ideas, his therapy, and his healing ability continue to work and help people and heal and relieve people from pain and misery and despair. That is our reason for being here today, to examine not only the Gerson Therapy, but other healing therapies as well – ones that do not drug and mutilate, but rather help nature to heal. That is our purpose here, to examine those methods. We do not necessarily endorse each and every one of them and each and every idea that is expressed. But, we would like you to learn, and understand, and choose, and know so that you can make intelligent choices. That, again, is one of our purposes here. Of course, the Gerson Institute is going to continue very intensively in this work to learn more, research more, and educate people more so that they can learn about health, healing, and especially prevention. It’s easier to prevent disease than to cure it. These are the points, the impact, of the Gerson Institute. I would like everybody to throw as much of their weight, their ability, their energy, and their help financially – if possible – behind us to help. Thank you.  [Applause]  Norman: To begin our formal program this morning, we had to pick somebody that was alive to wake everybody up. Mary Lee Rourke is that person who we picked. She’s got as much verve and excitement in her way of living as anybody we know. Mary Lee Rourke. Mary Lee: It’s hard for me to see your nice faces with these bright lights in my eyes. It’s surely my privilege to be here. According to the medical community, I died several years ago. So, when Norman says they wanted to pick someone that was alive, it’s a double bonus situation for me. In the program it says that I’m to speak"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #3 2 on “From Death to Life, My Conscious Choice.” It’s a privilege for me to say to you this morning that each of you has that choice. It is a conscious choice to live for health, for vitality, for happiness. In 1975, after a surgical biopsy on my lungs, an oncologist came to me and said, “Gee, Mary Lee, I’m sorry but you’re going to die.” Without batting an eye, without so much as, “Maybe that won’t happen,” an absolute, “Mary Lee, you will die.” Have there been times in your life when you have decided that your intuition was telling you that you were right and someone else was wrong? Well, something in me began to stir and said, “Could this man know all there is to know about the physical body – about the emotional and spiritual body and what healing is really all about? Is there a possibility that there is another choice for me, other than to die?” In 1972 my right eye was removed. I had lachrymal carcinoma. That’s cancer in the tear duct. In 1975 metastases were found in my lungs, and after the biopsy, considered inoperable. I was offered chemotherapy; although, the oncologist said that chemotherapy doesn’t do very much for cancer in the lungs. I began to study statistically what went on in the medical community, and I found out that it has absolutely no good results with anyone who’s had cancer in the lungs and hardly any good results with anything else, as far as cancer went. I’m a firm believer in answered prayer and I simply said, “I don’t want to die. Please show me another way.” This is when nutritional therapy came into my life, and I found out about Gerson Therapy. The tears that I cried were tears of gratefulness for having a choice. Each of us has to find what works for us. I had the privilege of being a participant in an article in “Family Circle Magazine” last February. It was entitled, “They Beat Cancer.” Each of the persons in that article used a different therapy and were all well. One person had even used chemotherapy. That’s a little bewildering to me, but nevertheless, something in him must have said, “This works for me.” It’s my personal belief that the Gerson Therapy is by far the most profound healing nutritional therapy you’re going to find anywhere. It works more swiftly, more thoroughly, and more completely to achieve totally renewed health. What happened to all of those people in that article? They made a choice about the medical community and the education that has been so widespread throughout the United States and the world, as far as cancer being a terminal, positively deadly situation. Each of those persons said, “I have a choice, and I’m going to make my stand for a conscious choice for life,” and they each sought their way."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #3 3 When a person has been diagnosed as terminal, what happens at that moment is that he or she essentially plugs-in to the consciousness of the whole planet. What does that mean? What it meant for me and what it has meant for the people whom I’ve had the privilege of working with has been a diagnosis of pain, agony, anguish, suffering, bleeding, surgery, and death by dissection and morphine. You can leave all of that behind you friends because that is not valid any longer. I stand here as, I hope, a positive memory in your minds that there was nothing in my life that I did to deserve this profound healing. What I did do was educate myself, as you are doing now. What I did was become tenacious, unwilling to give up, and I kept my eyes on the mark of what I wanted and kept going. When I began Gerson Therapy in October of 1976, almost all of my hair was gone, and I was gray in color, full of edema, in pain all the time. I was despondent. I was angry that this was happening to me. I’d had cancer once. I’d had cancer twice. I’d had 6,000 rads of cobalt to my head after my eye was removed. I truly felt victimized. But, I made that choice for nutritional therapy that deals with universal healing laws, which say if you give the body the proper nutrients and if you put the right fuel into the automobile, you’re going to get from point A to point B. You’ll get there. You won’t get there, though, if you forget to put the gas in the car or if you decide to take a siesta and a snooze and take your eyes off the road. But you’ll get there if you take juice after juice, eat salad after salad and bowl of soup after soup, and have cleansing enemas after enemas, all the while keeping your eyes on the mark of a healing reaction. I felt worse after I started Gerson Therapy than I did before. That’s a hard thing to take a look at. But when the body is fighting, and when the cancer is being destroyed, you feel crummy. There’s a war going on inside. The wonderful part about this is that you win, and the cancer dies. It took quite a while for me to feel better. My body was so deeply damaged. My life was so sad at that time with emotional upsets. I didn’t really know if I wanted to live or not. Part of me said, “Yes, I want to live” and part of me said, “I don’t know if I want to go on.” Somewhere in the middle of that fourth month of my therapy – when the pain had not stopped, and I’d coughed and coughed and coughed till there was nothing left of me – I was carried, I was fed, I was bathed, I was clothed, and I was put into a vapor tent in my living room because I couldn’t breathe very well. Remember that I was dealing with metastases in the lungs. What I was experiencing in the fourth month of my therapy was not the degenerative process continuing, which was"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #3 4 what the medical community would have told me because when you have lung cancer and the cough increases “that’s the disease increasing.” It was a frightening month for me to keep going in the face of what appeared to be a degenerative process, as learned by the education I’d had from the medical community. Three and a half weeks into that fourth month this intelligent body said, “Roll over Mary Lee.” I’d had a pot placed by the side of the couch, thinking that I had pneumonia or something and I would bring up phlegm. I didn’t wretch, and I didn’t cough. I just opened my mouth, and I could feel something coming up from my lungs. These little white masses came up and out of my lungs into this pot. I was totally bewildered at what this could possibly be. After that projection – getting that stuff out of my lungs – that cough stopped, and I had two days without pain. That was the first time after starting nutritional therapy that I had a seed of hope that I was going to live. If I could have two days without pain, why not more? After a hundred times on the therapy, I would come into a healing reaction period, which would be uncomfortable, and I would say, “If I get through this one, I’ll know that I’m healing and I’m not dying.” It’s a tough thing, my friends. What Charlotte Gerson was saying about prevention, or taking care of yourself before the fact, is really a wonderful statement. There’s something that I have done to help you with that. Some of you have these sheets already. For those of you that don’t, I’ll be sure that you get one before you leave. Gerson Therapy is so terrific that I wanted to direct my attention to helping others do it as easily as possible; so, to teach you I created a set of instructional tapes that go along with the book. The first half of the first tape will give you an in-depth story of my personal experience. The second half of that first tape will give you the layman’s explanation of this marvelous therapy. The second tape will teach you how to organize your home for the food and juice preparation, which is so essential because food is your medicine. The third tape talks about the infamous enemas: what they are, how to do them, what they’re for, and how not to do them. It also talks bout the healing flare-up, which can cause a terrific amount of fear and anxiety if you don’t understand it. It talks about medications and medical supervision. The very last tape talks about the role of stress and illness and includes a healing meditation. I put together my entire experience for you to make your lives easier as you begin to heal. Do you know what this weekend is? It’s my five-year Gerson anniversary weekend.  [Applause]  "},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #3 5 Five! A beloved friend who helped me with my therapy bought these flowers for me and there were five roses, one for every year that I wasn’t supposed to be here. I want you to know that I know deep within my heart, and I have the greatest conviction, that I won’t be able to wear the number of roses that there will be when I pass on (because there will be so many).  [Applause]  At the end of every lecture that I give, I make a statement that’s very, very important to me. Dr. Gerson, your spirit is here. I wish to thank him for the life that he led, which was dedicated to healing. He fought with the medical community to keep his research going, to put this therapy together. He was a persecuted man. For every moment of anguish, for every moment that he might have scratched his head and wondered if his efforts were worth it, he kept going; he kept his eyes on the mark. I give my life in service with the same kind of spirit to help as many people as I can on their roads to wellness. To Dr. Gerson I give the praise for my healing, and to God I give all the glory. Thank you.  [Applause]  Norman: Thank you, Mary Lee. Now we have our principle speaker for early this morning, Charlotte Gerson. I’m not going to spend a lot of time with introductions through the convention. We have a short biography for each of the speakers that we have. Since our program is very tight on time, we don’t want to go into long introductions. Charlotte...  [Applause]  Charlotte: Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. You see that the title of my presentation is “Healing Incurables - The Gerson Therapy.” I sometimes wonder what doctors or professionals might think about what I can do in 40 or 45 minutes. They wonder how, in such a short amount of time, I can give you an idea of how people, such as Mary Lee, were able to turn their lives around after they were definitely told they had no time left because their bodies were beyond help. Of course, I’m only a mouthpiece for Dr. Gerson. His main book, “A Cancer Therapy” is the basis of the treatment. We use it the way he wrote it. We use it exactly and completely. The therapy he used still works today on others, as you can see from Mary Lee. Let me give you an explanation of what we’re talking about. Obviously, when we talk about healing, you people have an understanding of that word means. But, I’m always concerned that the medical profession has no concept of healing whatsoever. They are not taught healing. If you ask a doctor just out of medical school what he’s learned, he will confirm that the classes"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #3 6 taught drugs and drugging. If some drugs don’t work, then there are others. If the some drugs cause side effects, then there are others to try. If those drugs don’t work, then there’s surgery. What about healing? There is no concept of healing. The healing arts are not taught. What is taught are drugs and drug management, chemotherapy and radiation for cancer, everything from antibiotics to painkillers, and so on. To address the underlying problem, doctors must ask, “Why is there cancer? Why is there pain? Why is there disease?” But, they don’t know to ask these questions. And, as long as it is vehemently denied, like the mouthpiece of the AMA is still doing today, that food has nothing to with disease, they will never heal. Let’s look at the question, “What is disease?” Only when we understand the underlying problems that cause disease can we come up with an answer and then turn disease around – to reverse the damaging trends and to recreate health. Here we come to one of the main points that Dr. Gerson made. He said that everybody has a healing mechanism. A doctor must learn to reactivate this healing mechanism, and then the body will heal itself. That point also explains how the book “A Cancer Therapy,” is not specific for cancer. This book and its appendix for modifying the therapy to treat non-malignant diseases can be used for totally healing all body systems, all problems, and all chronic diseases – whether they have a name or not. It makes no difference. The healing mechanism means restoring all body systems to full and normal function. Now, let’s examine what is disease. There are several levels of disease. In order to make it simple and easy, we’ll talk about the deepest and most complete level. That’s cancer. What is cancer? Cancer is not a lump or a bump. That is the final manifestation of the failure of the body systems. Cutting it out, therefore, has nothing to do with healing. It’s just removing a symptom, which is the orthodox approach to all medical problems. But cutting out cancer doesn’t heal; the cancer pops up somewhere else. So, what is cancer? The body basically has a number of major systems that make it impossible for cancer to appear, that make it impossible for wild growth of cells to happen in the body. Let’s examine those systems. One of the most important ones, Dr. Gerson said, is the potassium-sodium balance. There’s a constant exchange between the extracellular and intracellular fluids, which carry the nutrients and the cells that are needed to function, to work, to maintain your body systems. For instance, you eat food, it gets digested, and it’s carried through the fluid systems to each of the billions of cells in the body. The air you breathe is carried through the blood and the red blood corpuscles to each of the billions of cells. In order for these types of exchanges to take place, the majority of potassium must remain in the cellular system, and the majority of sodium must remain in the fluids, the blood, and serum systems of the body."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #3 7 That is a very basic thing. Dr. Gerson stated that well over 35 years ago, 40 years ago. Orthodox medicine was not able to prove that until about three years ago. They could never prove what went on inside the cell. Every time they look at your body function they look at serum, the blood. That does not reflect what goes on in the cell. So it took a long time to prove. But Otto Warburg, for instance, showed that a cell that has its normal complement of enzymes and utilizes oxygen to produce energy from the food that is carried to it, is a normal cell. When that cell loses the capacity to oxidize, when these enzyme functions and these oxidizing functions are no longer properly managed within the cell, Otto Warburg, who won the Nobel Prize twice, showed that this is now a malignant cell. This is a cell which has gone into a lower lifestyle, the fermentative metabolism. With that kind of metabolism the cell can only utilize this energy to grow and grow and split and grow. That’s cancer. This is one of the beginning problems, the potassium-sodium balance. If it goes out, and Dr. Freeman Cope and Clarence Cone and others, Ling and Associates, have all confirmed what Dr. Gerson said 30, 40 years ago, but couldn’t prove. It’s now proven. The potassium level, if it is reduced within the cell and sodium penetrates, invariably cell damage results, as usually cancer. Why is all of this happening? Why does the cell lose potassium? In nature, all our food and after all our body has evolved after millennia of the foods that were available [audio cuts out] [Audio cuts back in] Then we’re dealing with the inability of the properly handle proteins. These proteins accumulate and are not properly utilized in the first place. They’re not properly excreted. They accumulate in the body, they damage the collagen, the connective tissues. They now create accumulations. The body’s immune system fights hard to get rid of them. Now the doctors call it an autoimmune disease because the body supposedly is fighting its own tissue. It’s only fighting the material it can’t use. It’s in no way an autoimmune disease. The body doesn’t destroy its own tissue. No way. But it destroys the material it can’t handle and the sick tissue that results out of that material. So it’s a part of the damaged protein digestive system that you call collagen disease or rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, I don’t care what name you give it. Even schizophrenia is a problem of protein digestion. Therefore it’s also curable and it doesn’t really matter what name you give it. Then you have a problem of the fat digestive system. Part of the fat digestive system is that if it doesn’t work properly it can cause psoriasis. Other parts of the fat digestive system, if they don’t work, could cause you arthrosclerosis and other problems. Whatever name you give it, again, doesn’t really matter. If those systems are restored to function, you eliminate the disease. That’s how come. "},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #3 8 For instance, with the Albert Schweitzer family, which were all patients of Dr. Gerson. First Mrs. Schweitzer, who had lung tuberculosis. She was giving up. She was beyond help. She had a huge cavern in her left lung and it had spread and caused smaller foci in the other parts of her lung. She had given up. On the Gerson Therapy the immune system was reactivated, the body was able to kill the tubercucillum and in the sputum you could see the dead bacteria, attacked and destroyed by the reactivated immune system. And the body heals. She recovered. She lived another 25 or 30 years till 79 years old. She was in her early 50s when she was supposedly dying. During that time we used to go sleigh-riding with her daughter. She was a few years older than I. She developed little ulcerations on her skin at the time, one here, one there, not too much. But four years or so later she was covered with them, her whole body, thousands. It took two hours morning and night to bandage her when she was a teenager, 17, 18. She was sent all over the world for diagnosis. There was no way to diagnose it. It had only been described five times in the medical literature. It had no name or origin. Nobody knew what it came from. Then she came to my father for treatment. My father didn’t have a name for this disease either, nor a special cure, nor did he know exactly where it came from. But by restoring all body systems the body healed itself, the ulcers closed, the body became normal and healthy. She got married and had five kids. She’s still living today. You don’t even have to know a name for the disease to reactivate the body’s healing system so the body will heal. Then later Albert himself came to my father. He had diabetes. He was 75. He was despaired with living. He was weary and tired. He was fed these high protein diets that made him sicker than ever. He just couldn’t work anymore and he felt he didn’t even want to live. He came to my father and my father took off all protein. He went on the same juices Mary Lee was talking about, as were outlined in this book, “A Cancer Therapy.” The same juices, the same foods, the same detoxifying. Usually, especially in age-onset diabetes, there is insulin in the body. It’s there. It’s not being utilized. The enzymes are blocked and therefore not allowing it to be used. What are enzyme-blocking agents? You know them as toxins. Toxins are defined as enzyme-inhibitors. So when your body is full of toxins, your enzymes don’t function, your oxidative systems don’t function, your fermentative systems set in and you develop cancer or diabetes or you block your immune system or most any other problem. You block your digestive system or protein or fat system or whatever happens to be a weak spot in your, or maybe a damaged spot, or maybe some scar tissue that will cause you a problem. But the basic underlying thing is always the same. If the body’s systems work, the digestive systems work, if the body is helped to utilize, the cellular structures helped to utilize the nutrients when they are properly utilized and then excreted so no toxins remain in the body, there is no disease. "},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #3 9 All of this sounds real nice. You may say it even sounds logical and it sort of sounds simple too. It’s not that easy. But the main thing, and the only thing that comes, is a bottom line. Does the patient get well? That bottom line we’re here to show you. That’s why we have invited some 50 people - they couldn’t all come but most of them are here - some 50 people, a number of them recovered for many, many years, of cancer, terminal cancer. A number of them recovered from various other diseases, including lupus and rheumatoid arthritis and heart disease and kidney disease and Alzheimer’s disease and a whole array of others such as multiple sclerosis. I can’t name them all. And those diseases that have no name, like that of Raina Schweitzer. We have invited them here to show you that this is not just a theory a beautiful story, no matter how logical it may sound, but that we have the recovered patients that were pronounced incurable or dying of cancer as it may be, that are well today. We have five of the people that Dr. Gerson described in his book. Fifty cases, all of which but two were terminal. Of the 50, 48 were terminal. We have five here who were considered and pronounced terminal, were supposed to be sent home to die. That was 26-39 years ago. This book came out in 1958. These people had already been well for a number of years when the book came out. They are still well today and functioning normally. I want to stress this too. Healing and health mean, in my book, functioning normally without drugs, without mutilation, without constant painkillers, without constant trips to the doctor. When the body functions normally, like it’s supposed to function, that is health. Not just the body but when you have a healthy body your brain, too, functions normally, your emotions are in good condition, your outlook is good and normal. You cope. In other words, the whole human being is normal again. We have a young man here, for instance, who you will be meeting a little later, who had these problems, whose body was sick and damaged and toxic with drugs, whose brain didn’t work anymore either. But being detoxified and healed, all his functions are perfectly normal and he is normal and active again, like a young man should be, doing all the things you would expect without drugs. That’s what we think of as health. Now, I don’t want to run over the time because we want to have enough time also to show you a few of these people. As you have seen these presentations of the recovered, incurable scattered through the program, because I don’t want to bore you with showing you 40, 50 people one after the other. They will be scattered, a group now and then a group this afternoon and then two more groups approximately the same time tomorrow, a whole number of them former patients of Dr. Gerson, still alive and well. We have a number of them that are well into their 80s and active, in several cases working. In one case, traveling, fishing, having a wonderful time. Living normal, active lives when they were pronounced dying or incurable. We will show you some of these people. I think this is one of"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #3 10 the most important things of the Gerson Therapy, to show the results. The other very important point I touched on before and Mary Lee touched on before. It’s prevention. The Gerson Therapy is not easy. It’s tough. I’m not making any bones about it. It’s not easy for these cancer patients to be given 13 freshly squeezed glasses of juice a day, made from various combinations - carrots and apples, green leaves, rich in these oxidizing minerals, in their right combination, easy to assimilate. You want to remember that in most cases people who are very severely ill and toxic, their intestinal tract doesn’t function well enough to assimilate pills. They say, “Well, I’m taking my vitamins.” That won’t do, not when you’re really seriously ill. The body doesn’t assimilate them. They’re not in the right form. They are not live and natural. You say, “But I’m buying natural vitamins.” They are not natural in a pill. I always say that when I see them growing on a tree or on a bush then I’ll believe that they’re natural. A severely damaged body needs the fresh, live, natural, organic material to assimilate, to rebuild, to restore these depleted systems. Then it releases the toxins and you feel terrible, as Mary Lee explained, for a while, while that body gets rid of the toxins, while it begins to heal and turn around. It’s tough to get all the organic food for your vegetables or your soup, for your juices. it’s a lot of work. It’s not easy. It will heal. It will do the job. To do the enemas, to detoxify, to help the toxins out of the body. When you break down tumor tissue, this is toxic material. You’ve got to help it out of the body or you damage the liver if it stays in there. It’s hard work. It doesn’t go so quick or so easy all the time. When you have people like Mary Lee and a number of others we’ve had, who on top of their disease were damaged by radiation, it takes still longer. It’s a struggle. So what we say is why not learn prevention. That will be my major subject tomorrow but I’d like to touch on it. Prevention is easier than healing. Prevention means keeping poison from entering your body, keeping the processed food out. Remember that the FDA approved something like 10,000 food additives and chemicals that are spread all over your food, the processed food, the canned and jarred and pickled and preserved and dyed and emulsified and almost anything that is on grocery shelves. It’s damaged, it’s preserved, it’s chemical-ized. None of these chemicals are good for you, none. Enough of them, regularly taken, will cause damage. This also goes for drugs. Very many doctors will give patients drugs for high blood pressure and they’ll tell them, “You’ve got to take that for the rest of your life.” Any drug, for any reason whatsoever, taken long enough, will do liver damage. These 10,000 or so approved, “safe” supposedly food chemicals, taken long enough, will cause liver damage. You’ve already heard, most of you here, because you’re interested in health and are obviously here because you know a"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #3 11 little bit about it, you already know that the youngsters that are diagnosed as hyperactive are drugged and drugged until they’ve got brain damage and are no longer savable. If only you change their food to fresh food and live food and eliminate the food additives, they’re perfectly all right. They’re not hyperactive if they are properly nourished. This is already healing, it’s not prevention. The prevention begins before conception. The prevention begins in the soil, with food that is whole. Prevention is in the kitchen, every day. Prevention means not to use drugs and chemicals, whether it’s chemicals in the food or drugs the doctor hands you, they’re still drugs and chemicals. Prevention means nourishing the body properly the way it’s supposed to be nourished, keeping it clean and clear of toxins. Toxins, of course, are all over the place. Toxins increase today from the artificial fertilizers that go in the soil to the food chemical additives, to the poisons that are added to our water - chlorine, fluoride particularly. Most of you probably know that cities that have fluoridated water have at least an increase of ten percent in cancer in children. Now you understand why. Fluoride has some of the most powerful enzyme inhibitors known. When you inhibit enzyme functions then you don’t get oxidation in the enzyme levels in the cellular structures. I already explained to you that when the cell is inhibited in oxidation, it goes into the lower metabolism, the fermentative metabolism, which is cancer. You can see by the statistics that cities where fluorides have been added to the water supply, when they used to run very parallel for cancer incidents, the cities that didn’t get fluoridation continue on a pretty much even keel. The ones that have fluoride added go up steeply in cancer incidents. There’s been articles published that chlorine can cause cancer. When you hear Dr. Barnes speak you will understand partially why. I mentioned too that the thyroid gland that utilizes iodine for proper function, gets inhibited. Iodine can be inhibited by chlorine. So all of these things add to the problem. The fresh foods, the live foods, the organic foods, the materials free of poison designed for the human body as our long-back ancestors used to live, with food free of poison, freshly grown in healthy soil. Those foods keep the body healthy. Those foods heal the body. But it is much more difficult because now you have to make a total effort to detoxify, to turn around the disease, to get the drugs and the other damage out, to rebuild. That is an extremely important part of the Gerson Therapy. Let me explain. When the tumors or the disease symptoms disappear, we cannot tell the patient, “Okay, you are well now.” That’s not enough. If we did we would make about the same mistake that orthodox medicine makes. They cut out a tumor, say, “We got it all, you’re fine. There’s nothing left.” But what have they done to correct the underlying problem? With the Gerson Therapy when we"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #3 12 activate the healing mechanism, if we now eliminate the tumor, which we do, we do this by creating the best possible conditions for the body, the richest nutrients, the biggest help in utilizing the nutrients and the greatest help in detoxifying the body. When we do all that and the tumor disappears, if you were to stop the therapy right then, it will come right back because the organs are not yet functioning on their own properly, sufficiently. You will meet Edward, for instance, who after seven months he had no more tumors. He had no more pain. He had nothing. He quit the therapy. Three months later his tumor came back. It is not sufficient to get rid of the tumor. Now comes the long drag of rebuilding all the body’s systems. That’s the true healing. Getting rid of the symptoms is only the beginning. The true healing takes place when you restore all the organs, when you restore the liver, when you restore the other organs and the digestive system so that everything functions again normally. When the liver functions normally and is fully restored, you cannot be ill. The liver, Dr. Gerson said, was one of the most important organs in the body. It has many, many hundreds, maybe thousands (I don’t know) of functions to perform. If these functions work, and this liver works, you are well. Therefore then, restoring the liver is a very basic precept of the Gerson Therapy. Dr. Gerson also said that the cancer patient has a toxic, damaged liver. The chronic disease patient has a weak, damaged liver. So there is again a difference. The cancer patient needs more intensive detoxifying and support for his liver. But, and that is the interesting part, since cancer is very often a problem of the basic functions of the liver, of all the functions, and since the liver is one of the most restorable organs in the body, totally restorable - if you cut off a piece of it, it will re-grow. No other organ in the body will do that. The liver is fully restorable. Since this is possible therefore then the cancer patient is fully restorable. That doesn’t always apply to others. For instance, we have excellent results with emphysema. Much of the emphysema where the tissue is sick, can be reversed. Circulation can be increased, oxygenation can be helped. When lung tissue is dead, it’s dead. When it’s fibrous it’s gone. It will not restore. So that part is gone and that patient cannot be as fully restored as the cancer patient. Or let’s look at a kidney disease patient. Kidney tissue too, when it’s gone, it’s dead. Some kidney disease patients have to stay very close to the diet, to the therapy, for the rest of their lives or they will not function. We can often get them off the kidney machine, but only under very specific conditions because the kidney tissue is not as restorable as the liver tissue. The same goes for the central nervous system. We have excellent results with multiple sclerosis patients. But if they are gone too far, if parts of their central"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #3 13 nervous system are dead, they’re gone. If they are diseased, that can be healed, if they are dead, they’re gone. Sometimes we have surprised. We had a lady who had been in a wheelchair for seven years and had been unable to move her foot. We thought that was the end of that foot because we thought it was such a long time that probably the central nervous connection there was gone. After about a week on the therapy her toes, her foot, moved and she was able to cross her knees for the first time in seven years. So it’s hard to say. Sometimes there we get surprised. You’re not sure whether it’s dead or not. It’s worth a try. There are certain areas also, with Lou Gehrig’s disease, ALS, when it’s gone, it’s gone. We have a very interesting situation, for instance, in Dr. Gerson’s book. The first case, number one. We had invited her and she is fine today. She is alive. The only reason she couldn’t come is her husband is sick. Case number one was a fantastic situation. A pituitary tumor, exceptionally large, had destroyed the surrounding bone, had destroyed the right eye nerve. She was blind on the right eye, had partially damaged the left eye. She was partially blind on the left eye. She was brought to my father in a semi-coma on a stretcher unconscious in 1944, dying. Her sister sat by her, gave her teaspoon by teaspoon of juice, enemas and enemas. After one week she woke up. She is alive and well today, totally restored with half vision on one eye. For years she continued to work, was her husband’s secretary, functioning very nicely. She’s alive today, 79 years old. Her husband is sick. Unfortunately for that reason she couldn’t come. Many of these patients are still alive, not just the five we will show you. That’s total healing. But that means restoring the liver, fully and completely. Restoring the liver and the connecting organs and everything that comprises the body, totally and completely, is the total healing. It’s what takes time and energy. It isn’t easy. It’s not a shot or a pill. But as I said, the most important thing is that it works, that people get well. Yesterday I was asked, “What about anemia? Does it work for anemia?” I don’t like that kind of question “Does it work for...?” If I get asked that question it’s obvious that I didn’t make myself clear. I’m saying we are healing the total body. We are healing all the diseases that occur because the body isn’t functioning. Of course anemia is one of them. Most of the patients that have cancer have a degree of anemia. One of the patients that had rheumatoid arthritis had anemia. We don’t even talk about it because naturally that goes away too. If the anemia doesn’t go away you can’t heal. We support all of those systems. Between giving the liver juice, juice made from the young, very fresh calf’s liver, usually under a week old, fresh and young and clean, not yet damaged and because it’s made into juice the toxins are removed so you don’t have to worry, there’s no problems with the liver juice. But the liver juice helps the liver function. The B12 and crude liver"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #3 14 extract shot help the liver function. We do everything to reactivate the liver. So naturally the anemia, too, disappears. The skin diseases and often every other problem, old scar tissue, all of these things disappear. We don’t even mention it. We take it for granted. The high blood pressure disappears. We had a doctor, an MD, who came for a different problem. We took him off all drugs and cured his chronic cough that he had tried to help himself with drugs for years. Of course, drugs don’t cure. But he got rid of that chronic cough. He couldn’t believe that he could get his blood pressure functioning and be normal without any drugs. We took him off of the high blood pressure medication. In five days his blood pressure was normal. That, he said, if it hadn’t happened to his own body, he wouldn’t have believed it. They are taught, in medical school, they are taught by the drug companies, by everybody, once you have high blood pressure you need drugs for the rest of your life. They can’t believe that the body will heal. That’s what we are talking about. The Gerson Therapy. Healing, totally, all body functions, all body systems, so that the body maintains health, remains well. That’s the message we have for you today. Thank you.

I’m Norman Fritz of Healing Information Service. I work with Charlotte Strauss and the Gerson Therapy. We have recently planned this series of lectures because so many people had requested it and because we think it’s a very important message for everyone to have. In 1964 I became involved with Cancer Victims and Friends, that I’m sure a lot of you are familiar with. This is an organization started by Mrs. Hoffman from San Diego who had a good response to layaprotherapy [?] and subsequently followed some of the nutritional approaches. In 1965 she planned our first good-sized convention at the El Cortez Hotel in San Diego. It was all a new thing for us and we were all excited, a whole bunch of laymen that didn’t know anything about these things. We were seeking good speakers. At the time I had seen the Gerson book and was impressed by it. I called to New York because we wanted to get 50 or so of these sent out by Greyhound bus. The man there says, “Would you like to talk with Dr. Gerson’s daughter?” Of course I did. I talked with Charlotte Strauss, who of course was very interested in anybody that would order 50 books because at that time there was almost no activity with the Gerson Therapy. So she expressed an interest in coming out and talking for our convention also. She came out and we met at that time. She had been speaking for Cancer Victims and Friends and Cancer Control Society nearly since then. She was one of our best speakers. I used to put her on last because we thought it was a very good idea to end the conventions with a rousing speaker. She kind of wondered about this. She never said anything about it but she wondered because how could she sell her books if she was the last speaker at the convention? Now we get her in earlier in the convention. I mentioned the other night in Los Angeles that a pretty interesting thing happens. Each of us has a way of living and we become used to the things around us that everybody else is used to. In cancer most people have been used to the idea that it’s incurable. But there are some people that aren’t used to this idea and never"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" The Gerson Tapes #4 2 have been. One of these is Charlotte’s son, Howard, who until he was 16 didn’t realize that cancer was incurable because his grandfather was doing it all the time. Only when he went away from school and got away from home did he realize that most people considered that cancer was incurable. There is quite a story with this and Charlotte Gerson Strauss is the best one to give it to you. Charlotte.  [Applause]  Charlotte: Thank you very much, Norman. Tonight I would like to start you out with a thought that may be a little bit unusual and different. I got a very charming card from a young woman who said she was going to make an effort to be here tonight. I haven’t seen her, I don’t know if she’s here. She’s in her early 20s. She had a very unfortunate thing happen to her. She had a young child of two and the child died in an accident. Of course the emotional trauma and all that upset her for a long time. Altogether between this and probably some nutritional factors, about a year or so later she had atypical cells in her uterus. Of course, the doctor said all the organs had to come out. She heard through a friend about healing and she’s now totally well and healed. She wrote me this card. I think for a person this young this is remarkable because this is really, basically, the key note of my address to you. She said, “You not only taught me how to be cured, but because you taught me that it requires that one take responsibility for one’s own life.” I’d like you to think about that, in the light of a few other thoughts. Think about chronic disease. Medicine has made tremendous strides in controlling most of the germ diseases, staring with Pasteur and Lister and so on, vaccinations and immunizations. The medical science is almost totally able to take care of infections. But what about chronic disease? The mere definition, the total approach to chronic disease, well, it’s degenerative and when you go to the doctor the usual suggestion is to learn to live with it. Is that healing? Why should you give such a person responsibility for your well-being, the quality of your life when they can obviously not help you? You accept this because you are taught that the doctors are experts. The doctors are taught that there is no help for chronic disease. That’s a mistake. In 1946, in July, my father appeared before a US Senate subcommittee and demonstrated five cured cancer cases. Some of them could not be considered cured because they had not been well for five years, but they had metastasized cancer and they had become well and they were well several years, which was unheard of. It still is. He demonstrated this before the US Senate in 1946 and it is in the congressional record, public record."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" The Gerson Tapes #4 3 In 1976, in July also, almost to the day 30 years later, another committee met and heard a doctor, a doctor who is of the National Cancer Institute, heard him say the following thing, “Recent experiments have raised the intriguing possibility of using nutrition as a direct form of cancer therapy.” Recent experiments, the possibility. My father demonstrated already five cured cases 30 years ago. What’s happened in those 30 years? I can show you, for instance, that a Dr. Robert Good, immunologist, head of research at Sloan Kettering, came out in 1971 in October, showing that when you cut the protein intake of cancer-prone rats they either don’t develop cancer or they develop it a great deal later than the same rats of the same litter. This same Dr. Good was interviewed very carefully on the same day as the International Association of Cancer Victims and friends who were holding a meeting in the San Jose group. That very morning the San Jose paper carried an article, “What wonderful new tools medicine has developed to control cancer,” with a beautiful picture and the white coat of Dr. Good, the immunologist. It tells all about immunology. It tells you something great. “Good and his researchers have stumbled across an interesting idea, nutrition, as a means of manipulating the immune system.” Stumbled, in ’75, when in 1946 my father demonstrated that nutrition could heal. But they very carefully added at the end, “But this is in the very early stages and in the meantime you have to rely on the surgeries, chemotherapy and radiation for control of cancer, which is showing good results.” Good results? People are dying. Then another little thing happened. In the later days of February of this year, just recently, Joe Roth, the athlete, died of melanoma, one of the most malignant types of cancer, very rapidly spreading. He died. He had the best treatments. He had all the advantages of orthodox medicine. How come he died? “Well, it’s a rare form...” It isn’t all that rare. “It’s a rare form of the disease and we tried everything but there’s just no stopping it.” The man died. Then, because people were so concerned about this very promising young man and had sent him information and even Laytro [?] and other doses of medication that could have helped him, now there’s a big investigation going on in the mail fraud of these people that were just genuinely concerned because this man was dying. Now the authorities are investigating quackery. Here, the Evening Tribune of San Diego, February 24 th has a headline, “Three Agencies Probe Mail Quack Cures.” The American Cancer Society and the Food and Drug Administration, they curb cures for cancer. Meantime they say quackery when it comes to any of these non-toxic therapies. What, ladies and gentlemen, is the definition of quackery? In my book it means when somebody sells you an expensive therapy that they know is going to fail. That is chemotherapy, radiation and surgery. It is proven to fail because the"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" The Gerson Tapes #4 4 patients die. There’s another little item in here. Who is responsible? Who is committing quackery? There’s another little item in here, very interesting. It says here somewhere that the lower personnel in the hospital like nurses and janitors, have helped people to get information on these quack cures. I have heard a lot of nurses who are active in hospitals, terribly disturbed, upset and disgusted because they see these cancer patients all die. Here they have this marvelous orthodox, scientific treatment. How come they die? And how come we can show you a lady who’s picture you have on that little folder we sent out, that flier, by the name of Jackie Davidson, who had melanoma, the same thing that Joe Roth died of, all over her body. It was in her head, her neck, her chest, her torso, her legs, everywhere. The doctors told her death was swift and certain. They gave her no more than two months to live. They even rejected her from chemotherapy. They said nothing would help. She got a hold, somehow, a friend gave her the book by Dr. Gerson, “A Cancer Therapy.” She used it, totally and completely. It was rough. She was very ill. She had nobody to help her. They had no doctors. Doctors, under the California law called the “Anti-Quackery Law” are not allowed to use anything but the quack cures - surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. [laughter] The Anti-Quackery Law forbid the doctor to help somebody recover. When you have cancer, in other words, in California, if it is no longer in the original site, where sometimes they can still help you, when it has spread from the original site, when it’s metastasized, you’re supposed to die. The law says so. Ladies and gentlemen, that’s a bad law. But Jackie Davidson, on her own, at home without help, took this book and now a little more than a year and a half later is totally well. I can’t say cured because it’s got to be five years before it’s a cure. She’s rid of all the lumps and bumps and tumors. Well, that’s pretty good. This boy is dead, with the orthodox method. That is why I would like to speak specifically on the basic subject that you are responsible for your own health. I’d like to help you to understand how to regain health or maintain your health because my father showed the way. My father was a young doctor, about 26 or 7 or 8 years old, when he had very serious migraines. They kept getting worse. He was so ill that two or three days out of every week he was lying in a darkened room and vomiting and miserable and unable to function. He went to doctors and professors and teachers and they all told him, “Sorry boy. Just look at your books. You know there’s nothing we can do.” He said, “But I can’t live this way.” “Well, by the time you’re 55 you’ll feel better.” “But I’m 25.” He decided that under those circumstances he’d better do something about it himself."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" The Gerson Tapes #4 5 He thought about the problem and came to the conclusion that very probably there was something wrong in his body chemistry to cause this nausea and these spasms. He changed his food to change his body chemistry. He thought perhaps milk would be the right thing because any baby can digest milk. But he was just as sick as ever. Then he thought about it some more and decided that no where in nature do adult animals live on milk. Milk is not a food for an adult. So he changed to fresh fruit. In Germany where he lived the most available fresh fruit was apples. He used apples, applesauce, apple juice, mashed apples, cooked apples, raw apples, every kind of form. He was well. Then he slowly added one thing after another and found out very quickly, just by trial and error, what he could handle and what he couldn’t. Foods that he couldn’t handle would immediately produce a new migraine. Then he knew what to do and he lived on his migraine diet. He did so till the end of his life. If he didn’t he wasn’t feel well, he was ill and got headaches. By the way, I have the same migraines and I have the same problem. I have no problem when I eat right. Anyway, when patients came into his practice and complained of migraine, he told them, “Look, the books say there is no cure for migraines but I had migraines and I’m using this particular set of food to control it. I feel well. Why don’t you try it?” He found invariably that the other people responded to the migraine diet the same as he did. Until one day a man came back, having gotten this migraine diet and reported to his doctor, “I’m using the migraine diet and I feel fine. My migraines are gone. But on top of that I also have skin tuberculosis, lupus. And that’s gone.” So my father said, “No, no. That couldn’t be. It’s incurable. It must have been something else.” The man said, “No. I have the lab reports.” He showed them to my father. Sure enough he had had lupus, skin tuberculosis, and it was healing. My father said, “I am an internist and nerve specialist. My shingle reads that way. I don’t usually see skin problems. Besides, lupus is a rather rare diseases. Do you know other people who have it?” And the man said, “Yes, the hospital where I work, on the floor there were a whole bunch of people.” Father said, “Please send me some. I’ll treat them free. I’d just like to know if they respond the same as you.” He thought this man had migraines, there might be a connection with an allergy or something like that. Anyway, other people came with only lupus and they were well. Then my father thought some more about if it was tuberculosis. Perhaps other forms of tuberculosis will also respond. That’s how he found that skin tuberculosis and throat tuberculosis and kidney tuberculosis and lung tuberculosis and meningitis tuberculosis, all responded and people became well. At that time the wife of Albert Schweitzer, who had contracted tuberculosis in the tropics, came to my father and was totally cured. She had been given up. She lived many years later. "},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" The Gerson Tapes #4 6 More importantly, my father found out that these very severely ill tuberculosis patients often had other problems - asthma, high blood pressure, low blood pressure, heart trouble and other things, psoriasis, other disturbances. These also disappeared. That is how he understood, for the first time, that he was not curing a disease, that he had not found a cure for a disease. Remember, he was trained as an orthodox physician like all other doctors, that each specific disease has a drug or a cure. He found that when the tuberculosis disappeared, so do the other problems. Then he understood that he was not healing tuberculosis, that he was reestablishing the body’s ability to heal itself. The body proceeds to heal itself, no matter what the problem. If you reactivate the healing mechanism, the immune system, the mineral system, the hormone system, and everything to function again normally, the body will heal itself. In a normally healthy body you have a cut, it heals. You get a bruise, it heals. In certain people who are severely degenerative, who are pre-cancerous, they get a bruise and a cancer develops. That isn’t normal. In a normal metabolism there is no cancer. So healing means reestablishing the body’s own healing mechanism because it is failing you when you are ill. How does it fail you and why? How do you reverse this process? That’s really what I want to tell you about. My father discovered that the very basic problem in disease, for any disease to develop, first of all the body has to lose its potassium balance. You’ve got to become deficient in potassium. How do you do that? Why does this happen? In nature all foods, fresh foods, fresh greens, fresh vegetables, fresh salads, all food grows with the proportions that your body needs, of potassium to sodium. A great deal more, sometimes as much as 10 to 1,000 times as much potassium as sodium. But you get both, in just the right proportions, just the way your body needs it, if you get a good variety of foods, fresh foods, raw foods, freshly cooked. What happens when foods are processed, when they’re canned, frozen, preserved, pickled, jarred? They’re cooked in such a way that the potassium is lost. It goes down the drain. Then sodium is added, salt, to give you flavor. You’ve lost the potassium and you’ve added salt. Instead of having a lot of potassium and a little sodium, the way your body requires it, you’ve got it the other way around - a tiny bit of potassium and lots of sodium. Now, a normal, healthy body can handle this for a while. It will excrete the sodium. The body has a very careful mechanism through the kidneys and others, skin, perspiration and so on, to get rid of the excess sodium. It must because when there’s too much sodium there’s death, whether you have a salt sea or a salt desert or salt anywhere. There’s death. A little bit of sodium you need. Sodium has to stay in the serum. Potassium has to be in the cells. Therefore you get the exchange between the serum and the cells. You feed yourself, food and so on goes into the bloodstream. How does it go into the cells? It has to travel"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" The Gerson Tapes #4 7 through the potentials and these minerals, electrical potentials. If you now lose the potassium from the cells, sodium penetrates. Now you have sodium in the blood, sodium in the cells, no more exchange. Now the cell, in order to survive, does two things. It’s got to bind the sodium or it will die, so it picks up water. The sodium picks up water to stay in solution. That means edema. First you get edema. Then the cell can no longer produce an oxidizing system. When you get food into your system, into your bloodstream, the cells get energy by oxidizing it. I’m over- simplifying. Oxidation is done through the activity of enzymes. In 1965, seven years after my father published the book, some researchers, Dixon and Webb, came out and showed that for the enzymes to be activated, to be produced in the body, to be active and to do their job, the body needs potassium, the cells need potassium. What do you do when the cells have lost the potassium, when there’s sodium and edema? Sodium is an enzyme inhibitor. Now the cells can no longer function normally. The cells want to survive. They can’t survive because they can no longer oxidize food into energy. So they go into a fermentation metabolism. Oxidation metabolism, Otto Warburg showed, who was a Nobel Prize winner, he showed the oxidation metabolism means a healthy cell. Fermentative metabolism without oxidation, without enzyme function, is a cancerous cell. Now you’re in trouble. But, the body has a backup system. A cancerous cell is recognized by the body’s immune system as a foreign cell. Now the immune system steps in, isops [?] cells develop in order not to get your body damaged too much. The immune system steps in, breaks down the cell, digest it, continually breaks it down and gets rid of it. So how does cancer go ahead in your body? What happens? The immune system is also paralyzed. This is what I was trying to point out to you before. Dr. Robert Good, immunologist, said, “It seems that nutrition is a tool in activating or manipulating the immune system.” Of course! With the right nutrition we activate the immune system. Now I have sad news for you. His researchers have already published these facts, that what they call a high-residue diet, or a vegetarian diet, has not only a tendency but has already the proven effect of slowing down cancer and completely eliminating that metastases, in a book published by this group at Sloan Kettering, called “Cancer - Epidemiology and Prevention.” It says in there that vegetarian food, foods with high residue, fiber, will slow down cancer and metastases. How come they don’t tell you? How come they tell you food is a factor but where do you ever read what kinds of food? I’ll tell you because my father found it out long ago. They keep it from you. Cancer is big business. Not only cancer, or chronic diseases... The very first patient my father ever had when he came to this country, he was called over because he had helped a man with"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" The Gerson Tapes #4 8 osteoarthritis in Europe. This man had a second or third cousin who also had osteoarthritis, almost completely bedfast, pain, misery and deformed. My father came here to New York, he was called here and housed in the most elegant hotel. He was brought to this patient, examined him and then the doctors retired into conference - the house doctor, the specialist, the medicinal specialist, three others and my father. They talked about this case. My father very simply said, he would always say, “I propose such and such a therapy. I find such and such a case. Usually in this type of situation I find that say within three months most of the pain and swelling is gone. Within six months [indecipherable] functioning quite normally and he should be well.” A dead silence greeted him. He thought it was because these people had never seen arthritis healed. They didn’t know it could be done. No, that wasn’t the problem at all. When one of the gentlemen finally spoke up, he said to my father, “But Dr. Gerson, you don’t understand. You’re new in this country. These people are very rich. They are members of the great family. They own steamship lines and airplanes and banks and chemical factories. They’re extremely wealthy. They live in a duplex on Park Avenue, the most elegant section in New York. This man isn’t going to die of osteoarthritis. You don’t cure a man like that. You treat him.” This was the very first case my father ever had in this country. This was the only one of this type he’d take again. He had shown long ago that arthritis could be cured, even in long, stubborn, osteoarthritis cases. It takes time. These are bony changes and it takes time, even for the body when it is reactivated, to absorb and dissolve these bony problems. Let’s take for instance rheumatoid arthritis. It goes fantastically quickly. We’ve restored people in a month that had all their joints completely swollen. I have a girl, 24 years old, a girlfriend of one of the kids. When she was 21 she got into a serious stress situation. She fell in love with the wrong guy, the family disapproved, they threw her out, she went away, got married anyway, it didn’t work out, pretty soon she was divorced, the whole bit. And developed rheumatoid arthritis. By the time I saw her she was 24, had it all over her body. There wasn’t a joint in her body that wasn’t swollen and stiff and painful and some of them with bony changes. She had asked the doctor about diet and the doctor said it had nothing to do with arthritis. It turned out that the doctor tried to give some patients some carrots or a few apples and it didn’t help. Of course it doesn’t help. It’s not that easy. But when we got this girl, within three days these swellings and these big, red lumps, the swollen joints, came down to normal. You could see the designs on the bones and the tendons and joints in her fingers. She was sitting there curling her toes, just for the fun of it because for two years she hadn’t been able to curl her toes. Three days. After seven days most of the lumps and bumps were gone. After a month she was back at work. This was very funny because she worked in New York at Mt. Sinai Hospital. The guy who was supposed to look at her there, she was looking for eyeglasses and was supposed to get a physical exam previous to"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":" The Gerson Tapes #4 9 her eyeglasses, the doctor looks at her chart, because she had been there before for her arthritis. He said, “Whoever told you you had arthritis? There’s nothing wrong with you?” “Your boss told me.” And of course she’d had arthritis all over her body. But it was gone. In a month it was gone. You couldn’t see anything. Now comes the funny part. About two weeks later her boyfriend that she was living with, who was a medical student, a third-year medical student, his mother started to be paralyzed on one side. She’d had skin cancer many years earlier and was “cured.” But now she had brain cancer. One half of her body suddenly was paralyzed. She was taken to the hospital. He left school and he left the house and he stayed at her bedside. She was terribly worried and upset about the mother, about the boy losing his school year, his studies, and about herself. She was in a seedy neighborhood in New York, alone in this apartment. She was terribly upset and worried and nervous. What do you think happened to her? Nothing. Rheumatoid arthritis did not come back because in a normal, healthy, functioning body, stress can be handled, or we would all be sick whether from rheumatoid arthritis or with cancer. Stress does not cause disease. It may be a precipitating factor, if your body is already not functioning well and deficient and toxic. Then the additional stress can be the straw that breaks the camel’s back. But in a normal, healthy body, stress does not cause disease. Would anybody here like to raise their hand and say they lead a stress-free life? There is no such thing. We’d all be sick. That brings me to another important thing that I’d like to bring up. Recently a study has been made whereby some scientific people have come up with the following postulate. They have discovered that people who are negative, who have poor emotional responses, who are worriers, who are passive, are more likely to develop cancer. While those who are positive, and are happy and have active and good responses emotionally and otherwise, and are outgoing and so on, they’re healthy. They will not develop cancer. You know what? They’re right. But they’re drawing the wrong conclusion. When cancer is diagnosed in people it’s a lump or a bump. This is a long time in developing. All systems of the body have to deteriorate before cancer can appear. Therefore the oxygenation of the body, the enzyme system of the body, are severely depleted. Vitamins, minerals and so on are depleted. Your brain happens to be the most totally developed cell there is. The spinus differentiation takes place in the nervous system. Your brain requires more oxygen than most other cells in your body. It stands to reason that when your body is depleted in minerals and vitamins and oxidative enzymes, your brain is the first to feel it. You will become negative and miserable and depressed and your emotions will not function right. So what the doctors are saying, when you are miserable and unhappy and negative, you are in a pre-cancerous condition already so naturally those are going to be the people that develop cancer because they are already ill."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" The Gerson Tapes #4 10 What they do though, on the other hand, is if you are going to the doctor and tell them you’re not feeling good, you’re tired, you’re weary, you’re miserable, you’re dragging yourself to work, you can’t do anything with pleasure, then they run test after test after test. They say, “Our tests don’t show anything, therefore you are well. Go to a psychiatrist, it’s all in your mind.” I’ve heard this many times. It’s very, very cruel because these people are sick. They’re depleted. They’re pre-cancerous. But none of these tests show it. So now the doctor adds insult to injury and tells you it’s all in your head. If he were honest he would say the following, “You are not feeling well. I believe it. You are tired and miserable. I believe it. But our tests do not show what’s wrong with you. We don’t know what’s wrong with you.” How come they can’t tell you the truth? They know everything. If the tests show that you are normal or show nothing specific, then it’s in your mind because they can’t admit that they may not know something. You are responsible for your own health and your life because they don’t know. For instance, when you do have arthritis, what do they do? They give you aspirin. Is aspirin deficient in an arthritic person? Is arthritis a deficiency of aspirin in the body? That isn’t really funny either, because that’s modern medicine - a drug, a pill, a shot - to suppress a symptom. Where is the healing? Where is even the idea of healing? These are called the healing arts. When a doctor tells you you have a chronic disease, learn to live with it, is that healing? Chronic diseases are deficiency diseases, usually resulting in toxicity in the body. Now I should like to explain this to you. The way my father put it, I think most important is something very, very good to start thinking about the whole process. I’m reading now from the book “A Cancer Therapy,” specifically from Appendix Two, which is a lecture my father gave and is directed toward laymen. He says, “Already, through my work with tuberculosis, I’ve learned that in chronic, degenerative diseases one must not treat the symptoms. The whole body has to be treated. That is easily said. How do you do it? I came to the conclusion that the most important part of our body is the digestive tract. For all our intake to be properly digested and for other organs of the digestive tract to function right and help in the digestion to the end product, and at the same time eliminate all the waste product, all the toxins and poisons, which must be eliminated so that nothing will accumulate in our system, I thought that this was the most important thing in the treatment.” Now what happens when you lose the potassium level in your body? I’ve already told you. Enzymes need potassium to activate them. Sodium, on the other hand, inhibits enzyme function. So if you lose the potassium from your body, and the sodium starts to penetrate, your enzyme systems don’t work. When the enzyme system doesn’t work, what happens? You don’t digest your food properly. You can eat proteins and fats and so on and your body will not break these materials"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" The Gerson Tapes #4 11 down to the end product. Now you have semi-digested proteins, semi-digested fats, floating around in your bloodstream. Any one of a whole number of things can happen. Some of the diseases that are directly related to the inability of the body to break down protein completely are, arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosis, kidney disease, schizophrenia. From poorly digested proteins. But your nutritionist and most of your doctors will say, “Eat a lot of protein to mend your tissue.” No way. When the body isn’t functioning fully, and your digestive system is suppressed, toxic and not working right, you cannot digest proteins. That includes hypoglycemics and diabetes, diabetics. Already the pancreas is ill. Now they say nothing but proteins, proteins, proteins. No carbohydrates. You’re overloading the sick pancreas with more work and then you’re surprised that the next thing is heart trouble and kidney trouble and blindness and gangrene. Where does anybody ever cure diabetes? My father cured it. Dr. Albert Schweitzer came to see my father with diabetes. What did my father do? Albert Schweitzer had gone to the foremost French specialist in diabetes and he was like everybody else with diabetes, “Proteins, proteins, proteins and insulin.” He felt terrible and weak and tired and depressed and couldn’t work anymore. He wanted to go back to his beloved Africa. Father took him off the protein. Very shortly he could cut the insulin in half, even though he was getting the fresh, raw juices, carrots and apples, full of sugar. But the kind of sugar the body can handle. Through detoxifying, reactivating the enzyme activity and the activity of the pancreas we even were able to reactivate the insulin flow. After a while Dr. Schweitzer could get off the insulin altogether. As you know, he went back to Africa and lived till 90 in activity, not weary and tired and limp with limbs cut off and legs cut off and heart trouble and blind, but active and well. That is healing. I’d like to tell you about another diabetes case. He came in, he was in good health except a little problem with diabetes. He wasn’t taking much more than 10 or 15 units of insulin a day. But he wanted to get off it. He had heard discussion. He took two weeks off of work to get well from diabetes. It doesn’t go that fast. Anyway, he came in and went on the total, full intensive therapy, detoxifying thoroughly with four or five coffee enemas a day, 12 glasses of juice, liver juice, the whole thing, the right food, fresh, raw food. He was even able to eat potatoes. After the eighth day, in the course of the morning, he got the chills. By afternoon he had a fever. By evening he had the chills and fever and he was vomiting and he was very, very miserable. He had come in healthy. By that night he started to blow dried material, dried pus-y stuff from his nose. All that night and all the following two days and nights he was voiding masses of puss from his sinuses. He didn’t know he had sinus trouble. He never had postnasal drip or headaches or stuffed noses or anything. But there it was, masses of pus in his sinuses. When that stopped, when the sinuses were cleared and when all the poisonous masses,"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" The Gerson Tapes #4 12 toxic inflammation material and pus, had cleared from his sinuses, the insulin started to flow. Nobody knew it was there but the body knew. Nobody was fooling around and poking around in his sinuses. We were only helping the body to heal itself. The body threw the mass out and then there was no more inhibition of enzyme activity and the insulin flowed again. That is healing. Do you understand? We also had a woman who was brought in, many, many years ago. Her retina was detaching. She was going blind. She was a very prominent lady, many of you would recognize her name. She’s surely dead by now. She was an elderly lady. She had doctored around. When your eyes are sick, what do you do? You go to the eye doctor, right? She had gone from one eye doctor to the other with radiation, laser, operations, shots, pills and all kinds of things. She was continually losing her eyesight more. When she was brought to my father he did not check her eyes or her eyesight. That was checked millions of times. He looked at the reports. He looked at her body, her whole body, and he found that she had kidney trouble. She had pus and [indecipherable] and all kinds of problems in her kidney. So he cleared up her kidney, detoxified the body. Lots of juices loaded with minerals and enzymes and vitamins. Detoxified with enemas. Get the body to work. Get the liver to activate the immune system. Help the body in every way. Give it the material it is deficient in. Pretty soon the kidney trouble cleared up and the retina grew back. What was happening is through the kidney disease there were toxic materials floating around in the bloodstream and they were causing the symptoms in the eye. This was just the symptom. This was not the disease. “You must learn not to treat the symptom,” my father said. He learned that. But the whole body. The body knows where the problem is and the body will heal itself. When you go to the doctor you get a shot or pill or a drug or a powder. It’ll suppress the symptoms. Unfortunately, a lot of the public -- I don’t mean you people. You wouldn’t be here if you were among them. But many, many, many, a very large majority of the public, when they come to the doctor and they have some complaint or other, obviously a chronic problem, and the doctor tells them, “Well, you’ve got to change your way of life. You’ve got to change your food and nutrition. You’ve got to cut out smoking and cocktail parties and drinks and steaks,” and so on. Too many people will say, “I can’t be bothered with that. Can’t you give me a pill or a shot?” The doctor, if he says, “That won’t help you,” the patient will go to the next doctor next door and get his pill or shot and go on his merry way, his symptom relieved. But sending him back to the doctor, weeks or months or a year or two later, with worse problems. That kind of medicine I don’t have to sell you. You’re not here to hear that. Healing, total healing, is done only by the body. What we have to do is help the body. There’s two basic steps involved in all healing. They’re very simple when I mention them. They’re very difficult for you to do. The two basic steps are"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" The Gerson Tapes #4 13 detoxify the body and rebuild all the organs with the enzymes and minerals and vitamins and things that it has lost. The detoxifying is done in several ways. My father explains in the book. First of all we give to these people as much as 12 8-ounce glasses of freshly squeezed juice. Not can and bought and jarred and dead. Alive. The live biological substances in their biological surroundings, in their colloidal suspension, not disturbed and damaged by preserving and dying and bottling and jarring and fixing. Fresh and natural, just squeezed and drunk. The live substances. As many as 12 glasses made up of two different types, or three or four different types of juices, one with carrot and apple, one was a mixed green drink used mainly in the form of lettuce-type leaves with a little apple also mixed. Then we use a carrot and apple with some raw cow’s liver. My father found that when the soil became so severely damaged and people became so thoroughly poisoned, through the soil, through the fluoridation in the water -- and fluorides are the most violent enzyme inhibitors. They throw them in our drinking water! Fight it. They damage the body so severely that at one point he found he could no longer heal without the addition of the fresh raw liver. The liver is the healing organ in the body. The liver is damaged and sick when you are ill. The liver has to be helped. The raw, fresh, young calf liver is one of the best single things that will help to rebuild the liver. We found that without it we could no longer cure cancer. Other chronic diseases can still respond, but cancer is such a deep total deteriorating disease that without this fresh, raw liver juice we could no longer cure cancer. The same holds now. So these juices were used, 12 glasses or more a day. But that isn’t enough. We also use a special soup. This soup has a specific effect to cleanse the kidneys. They also need to be activated and cleansed. But that is still not enough because now the body releases all kinds of toxic material into the blood stream. In the course of this blood going through the liver for filtering, the liver picks up a lot of toxic materials. It must be helped to discharge and get rid of it. There’s only one way to do it. Enemas, specifically coffee enemas. The caffeine in the coffee was already found by some German professors to open the bile ducts. They introduced the caffeine into the rectum of animals and found that the bile ducts opened and the body was able to discharge toxic material. That is the only way to now get the toxic material out of the body fast enough. When we pick it up and activate the body, the body picks up these masses of toxicity. If you don’t get rid of them fast enough, with the help of enemas, you get new trouble. You get headaches, you get nausea, you get all kinds of toxic symptoms. It doesn’t work. These enemas are absolutely unavoidable. In the beginning we give them every four hours, coffee enemas. "},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" The Gerson Tapes #4 14 If you have the thought that most people have in their minds, “I’ve had a bowel movement, what do I need an enema for?” Then you haven’t understood. We are not interested in the food waste. We know you pass that along. That’s completely immaterial. The important thing is the toxic material that has to be eliminate through the liver and bile that the liver picks up out of the bloodstream. Then sometimes we get these masses of black and dark green material that come out of the bile. No way can you get that out with a bowel movement. That is total detoxifying. Now when the toxins are gone, and the definition of toxin is enzyme inhibitor, when these toxins are gone enzymes are activate again, the immune system is activated again and we start the healing. When the immune system steps in again and recognizes, for instance, the tumor mass as foreign cells, which it should have done all the way back but it was paralyzed with all this toxic material, now the immune system is activated against it. Now it recognizes tumors as toxic material, attacks them and kills them. Now we have dead cancer masses in the body. It’s like a lump of dead flesh. Have you ever eaten rotten meat? Do you know what that does to you? It makes you very violently ill. But this is inside your stomach. These dead tumor masses are in the bloodstream. They’ll kill you if you don’t get them out fast enough, through enemas and enemas and enemas. In the period of this very strong, heavy absorption, we don’t relent and say now the body is doing it’s job. If we let up on the enemas, then we get a poisoning of these dead masses and chronic material floating in the bloodstream. They now poison the liver and cause liver coma. Then we step up the enemas, sometimes as much as every two hours, and the patients get relief. They feel what good it does them. The pains are gone and they have no more nausea or headaches. They take it on their own every two hours now. They don’t even have to be told. The tumors go down and disappear. That is how we can heal melanoma and other cancer. There are 50 cases described in this book, all but two of them were terminal, incurable. Many of these people are still alive and well today. I don’t even make an effort to follow them up. Every once in a while somebody pipes up and says he knows that so and so is still alive. They are not the only ones. My father selected these to be representative of all types of different types of cancers. It doesn’t matter what the type is called and what name you give it or what you have because when the body is ready to heal, when you have reactivated the healing, detoxified and rebuilt the liver with the right material, the body will heal. No matter what you call it melanoma, sarcoma, carcinoma, blastoma, glioma, I don’t care. If you later on ask me, “Is it good for so and so?” Then I haven’t made myself clear. It is not good for... It helps the body heal itself. It is not for a specific disease. We had a woman who came in. She was 80 years old. Glaucoma and she had"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":" The Gerson Tapes #4 15 serious high blood pressure and she had edema in her ankles. This is what she came for, she had a bronchial cough that didn’t let her talk or sleep or do anything. She couldn’t stop coughing at all. In eight, nine days we had her sleeping like a baby, no codeine or drugs of any kind. After two days we cut out her high blood pressure medication. In four days her blood pressure was normal. We never had anybody who high blood pressure more than four days. Except later on I’m going to show you a guy who had it for five days. I told him he was one day late. But this lady had high blood pressure and all these other problems and she got rid of it. It wasn’t until seven months later that I got a letter from her at Christmastime, she was feeling fine. She also had lost her cataract. I didn’t even know she had cataracts. It doesn’t matter. They went away. Her surgeon told her she didn’t need surgery, she wouldn’t ever need it now. When the body heals, it heals itself totally. Now let me just have a word about prevention. I told you that the basic step to all healing is a dual approach - detoxify and rebuild. Now, how would we apply that to prevention? Prevention is very simple. It’s the easiest thing in the world. Do not allow toxicity to accumulate. This is what my father says. For all our intake to be totally digestive to the end product and not letting any toxicity accumulate is the answer. How do we do that? Obviously, don’t overtax your body with hard to digest substances, with empty calories, with dyes and emulsifiers and chemicals that your prepared foods are loaded with. Fresh food, natural foods, raw foods, things your body can not only digest to the end product, but things that give your body the material it requires to function totally and completely and properly, for the immune system to work. We had a lady, she was the daughter of a patient 28 or 9 years old, constantly old for eight years she constantly had bladder infections. She couldn’t get rid of them. The doctors had given her everything, every kind of antibiotic, every kind of sulfur drug, nothing helped anymore. Finally the doctor said, “Look, I’m sorry. There’s just nothing I can do for you.” In the meantime her father was recovering from cancer and sinus trouble and high blood pressure and fibrulation and every kind of thing. She was ill. Finally we got her to do the same thing. Her immune system wasn’t working, the beginning of serious trouble. She didn’t use the therapy as strictly as a cancer patient would. She used a modified therapy. Instead of 12 glasses of juice she used five or six. She used two or three enemas a day. In a month she was rid of her migraines and she had no more infection, for the first time in eight years. I’m not even talking about healing. I want to talk about prevention. But I do want you to be aware that most of us now will consider ourselves well when we have little problems. “Oh well, an occasional headache, an occasional cold, maybe a twinge here and there, a little arthritic pain here or there.” You’re really healthy. But you’re really not. Those of you who are really healthy, this is what my father"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":" The Gerson Tapes #4 16 suggests. Also in the book there’s a chapter on prevention. About 75 percent of your food should be fresh food, raw food, freshly-prepared, rich in the materials your body needs to work with. Then 25 percent of your choice could be choice. He even goes so far as to say that it’s okay occasionally, on a holiday or a feast day, a little ice cream, a little cake. Would you believe it? If your body is clear and clean and activate itself enough to get rid of this stuff again, and has enough minerals and enzymes from your usual diet to handle this sort of thing, you can even do that. You can even take a little sip of wine once in a while. But not for healing. This is for keeping well. If we really want to think of prevention we begin prenatal-ly with the mother eating right and especially after the infant is born. What about mother’s milk against cow’s milk or formula? We are now raising the third generation of children on canned baby food. Each succeeding generation is sicker than the one before. Each succeeding generation has more leukemia and more cancer and more diabetes. I can tell you, at least give you an idea, why more and more children have diabetes. In a little journal called “Today’s Living” in February of ‘76 there was an article of diet in early childhood. There was a little tabulation on the contents of the fruits and desserts that are in the baby food jars. You think you’re doing a great thing when you feed your baby these fruit jars because it’s fruit, isn’t it? Did you know that most of these are about 17-27 percent sugar? However, if you really want to do something for your baby and give him custard with milk and egg and all the good things in it. Gerber’s baby custard contains 44 percent sugar, more than lollipops. You don’t know these things. Inform yourself. You are responsible for your life. Now I tell you the sad results of this sort of thing. In South Bend where I was working in the area there was a school that had two classes of first graders, could be what about 60-65 children. They had to add an extra teacher for these first graders because out of these two classes of first graders, 13 children were diabetics. Six years old. Does it make sense? When their food is loaded with sugar, when they become sugar addicts before they’re weaned and they continue to eat sugars and candy and lollipops and ice cream and sodas loaded with sugars. Fresh foods, raw foods, cooked fresh and ground up in a little grinder, that’s the food for children. Mother’s milk to begin with. You see, formula is cow’s milk and cow’s milk is a lot higher in sodium than mother’s milk. Did you know that? Sodium is for fast growth, cancer or other fast growth. The cells require sodium. A cow grows up in about two or three years. What is your baby in two or three years? Is he grown? The human develops slowly. It’s much more finely differentiated. The human brain is the most highly differentiated. It can only be done with potassium. But the cow’s milk doesn’t contain that much potassium. It contains sodium for fast growth. Are you raising cows. So you are already starting the baby off with an"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":" The Gerson Tapes #4 17 excess of sodium.

These children develop leukemia and diabetes and they have high blood pressure at an early age. Nowadays cancer is the number one cause of death in children under 18, after accidents. It didn’t used to be that way. It’s now the third generation of children raised on baby foods - dead masses of food as Dr. Gerson called it. Dead, denatured, overcooked, canned, jarred, bottled and chemical-ized, with monosodium glutamate in it. It’s poisoning these children. Give them fresh food. Give them mother’s milk. Give them fresh, raw, grated apples, fresh mash bananas, fresh juices. Convenience, the food industry says. I assure you it’s not convenient when your child has leukemia. You pay for it. You pay for convenience not only at the cash register. You pay in heartache and sick children. Convenience is not convenient. It may save you a little time in the kitchen, you open a little jar and flip a lid, but the consequences, as Dr. Gerson put it, are terrible. Ice cream is poison. There are too many chemicals in it and sugar. It’s not even straight sugar in there! And chemicals for flavor and chemicals for balance and chemicals for all kinds of things to make it tasty and smooth. And poisonous. Children, once they are in school and teenagers and live off frankfurters on a roll and a Coke. Mention one mineral or one enzyme or one vitamin in that lunch. What does the body live on? When you get these so-called empty calories you’re not only getting empty calories, you’re depleting your body. What is an empty calorie. If you put something into your system that gives you nothing in the line or minerals and enzymes and vitamins, you are utilizing your systems’ reserves to even break that material down, to digest it, to put into circulation, to utilize it in your cell, to get rid of the waste again and get it out of your body. For all these processes your body has to supply, of what reserve it has, to handle that material. So it’s not just empty calories. You’re drawing on your reserves to get rid of the stuff. Not to mention in a frankfurter the sodium nitrates, sodium nitrite and the other chemicals that are in there that further damage you."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #5 2 Now I ask you, if you constantly draw out of your bank account, steadily, always draw out and never put anything in, what happens? You’re bankrupt after a while. You’ve got to be awfully rich, a multimillionaire, to be able to write checks all the time and not have to put anything into your bank account. What about your body? If you constantly draw out of it, with empty foods, dead foods, damaged foods, how long is your body going to last? How much of a reserve have you got? How rich were you to start with? Ladies and gentlemen, that’s the problem. We don’t know. We all at this point have a certain degree of degenerative damage. We are not as strong and as healthy anymore as our ancestors five, six, eight, ten generations ago. So, you cannot draw forever on your bank account and not go bankrupt. Bankruptcy is chronic disease. Total bankruptcy is cancer, when there’s nothing left in the body. Let me tell you, my father also writes about the work of two researchers in the 20s - Yamagiwa and Ichihara. They used tar to produce cancer on the ears of rabbits, a carcinogenic product. They killed a control group after three months and they found some damage to the central organs - the liver, the spleen, the kidneys, the pancreas, the brain, the lungs. But no tumors as yet. After six months another control group was killed and much more severe damage was found through these tar products, through the system. No tumors had yet appeared. It was not until after about eight months that the first tumors appeared. Very serious damage to all the central organs. What does that mean? Cancer is a totally degenerative process of all body organs. Therefore, if you now take a knife and cut out the piece, have you healed? Is this a cure? Is it surprising that the cancer comes back if you use chemicals and burn it out, with radiation, or worse yet with chemotherapy? The chemicals used in chemotherapy are the heaviest poisons known. The body is not able to get rid of them. Unfortunately I’m going to answer some questions right now. After the use of chemotherapy we are not able to rid the body of its level of toxicity. The essential organs we need to restore and rehabilitate the body and heal were not restorable after chemotherapy and we have failures. So don’t ask me, I can’t help you. The Gerson Therapy by itself is not effective after chemotherapy. The other methods, I don’t want to tell you, it’s a death warrant, the other methods, the other ways. But this therapy will not do it because we get to the very basic system through these chemicals. They’re damaged, they’re destroyed beyond restoring. The liver, certain cells in the liver, the bone marrow, they cannot be restored. My father also said that after a certain amount of radiation, some 15 or so cobalt treatments or more, too much damage is done to the body for restoring. The disease is not the problem, the treatment is. He was not the only one to say so. I"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #5 3 have an item here from Dr. Hardin Jones who was a physiologist working in the University of California, Department of Medical Physics. He studied cancer for 23 years and the cancer cures are more deadly than the disease. He found, in most cases, that untreated cancer patients out looked cancer patients four to one. Again I tell you, learn, study, do the right thing. Be responsible for your own life and health because the doctors don’t know how. There’s total healing available, provided not too much damage has been done through toxic medicine. Let me come back for one minute to the idea of total healing. When we have, through the right activation of the body, through detoxifying and reactivating the body’s healing. When we have eliminated the tumor we have not healed, we have only gotten rid of the tumor. We have not healed the patient. Just disappearing the tumor is not healing because until all the organs are totally restored to function well and completely, to break down foods to the end product and detoxify the body completely, until that time the patient is not able to maintain his health if he goes back to so-called normal or usual foods. Therefore, in order to heal totally the cancer patient so that he will maintain health and remain well, my father said it takes as much as 12 to 15 generations of new liver cells. The liver, the organ that’s responsible for healing. Each new generation is a little bit healthier than the previous one. But each new generation takes five weeks. So 12 to 15 generations takes 15 to 18 months on this very strict, difficult therapy. It’s not easy ladies and gentlemen. I’m not promising you a shot and a quick cure. It’s a lot of work. It’s hard to do. It’s not convenient. But so far it’s the best way we know. If you have a better way, I’d be glad to hear about it. It’s total healing. It’s prevention and it’s keeping well. Now I’d like to introduce to you a gentleman who used this therapy a number of years ago. He’s here. He wasn’t supposed to be here according to his doctors. He was operated on in October of 1966. They took out a tumor from the [indecipherable]. It was an invasive type of tumor, had probably already gone through. They said they completely excised it and the base was [indecipherable]. But, the microscopic examination of the tumor, and I’m reading the surgeon’s report, “the tissue revealed a papillary transitional sar carcinoma grade three to four.” Most of you will know that cancer is divided into groups one, two, three and four. One is the least malignant and four is the most malignant. Three to four is at the very borderline of about the most malignant possible. He said, “We consider this a highly malignant tumor. Approximately a month after the operation the person visited our office as part of his follow-up care. He was advised at that time that because of the extremely malignant nature of the tumor that we thought he should have first radiation to the bladder in conjunction with tumor chemotherapy. Following the completion of this first treatment he entire urinary bladder should be removed.” A rubber sack. Mutilation. Poisoning."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #5 4 Radiation. Burning. They’re great with that. It doesn’t hurt them. He was told that, “We felt unless this course of action was carried out that his chances of survival were very small. Due to the highly malignant cancer of his tumor Mr. Grover was advised that this operation and treatment should be performed at the earliest possible date. But Mr. Grover informed me that he had consulted with the physician in New York who employed a non-surgical therapy for this disease, that he had decided to follow this therapy plan rather than to undergo further surgery.” Fortunately Mr. Grover did that and he’s here today to tell about it. He was quite strictly on the therapy for about two years and then he pretty nearly abandoned it and went back to his normal way of life, working and everything. He told me last September, he came to me, and he said after a few years he developed high blood pressure. He used the book again, knowing how to take care of himself. He read Appendix I of the book, which is the less intensive therapy for non-malignant disease. After five days his blood pressure was normal. If you would, Gregory, come up and tell about your experiences. We would appreciate that.  [Applause]  Would you also give us the readings on your high blood pressure and how it came down? Gregory: In October of 1966 I had symptoms of cancer in the urinary tract. I went to Mount Sinai and the urologist who did the examination of me, under an anesthetic was supposed to be one of the tops in the country. I signed a paper agreeing to a biopsy. I didn’t realize that this gave him the right to remove the small tumor they did fine, otherwise I never would have agreed to it. I had learned about the Gerson Therapy some years past and decided if I ever had cancer this is the therapy that I would follow. After I came out of the anesthetic, the day following, the surgeon came in to me and he told me that I had cancer, that I had a grade three to four, which is practically a four. He advised me to come in to see him shortly afterwards. When I came into his office then he explained what Charlotte read to you and advised having the entire bladder removed. He told me if I didn’t have it removed I had only a five percent chance of survival. I said, “What would be my chances if I had it removed?” He said, “50 percent.” So I thought to myself that I would like to have 100 percent. I went to New York to see the physician who was a success with Dr. Gerson and I started the Gerson Therapy and did it for two full years. At the end of the first year I went to the surgeon’s office and he did a cystoscopy and said, “Congratulations, the bladder is clean.” I said, “How about the Gerson Therapy."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #5 5 I’m impressed.” He said, “No, it’s because I did such a fine job.” I thought, under my breath, “You son of a gun. If this was the case, why did you want my bladder removed?” So after two years I had another cystoscopy and everything was fine. Then I continued my activities as a spiritual psychologist. When I decided to go on the therapy I was given the name of several people who had recovered under the Gerson Therapy. I didn’t see any need to check up on them but I decided I’d do it. While I was in New York I spoke to two of them. One was a man who had been in the Merchant Marines. He had bone cancer. He was in the Merchant Marine hospital to die. He knew it. One day he said to one of the attendants, “If I’m going to die of cancer I’d like to find out what it is. Can you get me a book?” So the attendant, not knowing any better, went to the medical library of the hospital and brought a book titled [shows book]. The man read it and said, “I’m going to get out of this hospital and go on the therapy.” He advised the hospital staff that he was going to leave in a few days. The day after the attending physician came in and said, “I hear you’re leaving. You’re crazy. You’ll die if you go out.” He said, “I’m going to die anyway. By the way, I read this book. I’d like you to take a look at it. I’m going to go on this therapy.” So the physician took the book and looked at it. He said, “That’s nonsense,” and threw it on the bed.I spoke to him ten years later. He is in fine health. Another person I spoke to was a woman in New Jersey. As I had bladder cancer, she did too, but it was much more extensive than mine. It was not between three and four, it was four. When the surgeons opened her up they took a look, they sewed her up and they told her husband nothing can be done. This man apparently had something of a spirit that I had and he decided he wouldn’t give up. He found out about Gerson Therapy, went to the physician whom I had visited and one year later the surgeon who had originally operated on her, examined her and said, “I see no evidence of any cancer in your body.” Three friends of her who are physicians volunteered to make a written statement for any publication in the country that her recovery was a miracle. They wouldn’t say it was due to the Gerson Therapy, they were just willing to testify that it was a miracle. Then about a year after I was on the therapy I was at one of the cancer conventions and I heard a man ask a question about the Gerson Therapy and he said he had been on it. He asked the physician who was speaking at this convention. I approached him afterwards and asked if I could see him. I went to see him in his office, he was the head of an investment corporation, a very handsome, robust man. I believe he is case ten in the book. He was a minister. His wife was a nurse. They found he had cancer and were going to remove his left arm, part of the armpit and breast muscles. He was reconciled to it. He told me as a minister he had often thought about death and he was ready for it. His wife happened to be speaking to a friend in a neighborhood who said, “I want you to meet someone I know who had cancer and was saved.” So his wife went to this"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #5 6 person’s home and the woman says, “You bring the husband here,” which she did, and she said, “I’m going to call Dr. Gerson. I want you to talk to him.” The minister spoke to Dr. Gerson on the phone and Dr. Gerson, who as you may know is German, spoke with a German accent. He said, “Don’t go on this therapy. You come here.” The man went to New York, spent one year in the clinic, came back, went on the therapy and decided he didn’t have to follow it very strictly. Eight weeks later he had breast cancer. He called up Dr. Gerson and Dr. Gerson says, “You run on the therapy strictly.” He was on the therapy for one year and was in excellent health. There was on other woman that I spoke to, she was a professor of psychology at UCLA. She had been to Dr. Gerson a number of years before. When she came to Dr. Gerson’s clinic, Dr. Gerson said, “I wish you had cancer, it would be better.” She had a liver disease. Ordinarily people spent one to two weeks in the clinic. She spent three months. I spoke to her about ten to twelve years later. She was not in good health, but she was still alive. I had a prostate condition, which unfortunately the therapy didn’t help very much. I neglected it. As a result of that I’ve had a kidney blockage. Last summer the urologist wanted me to go to Mount Sinai to have a retrograde examination. I didn’t want to do this. I spoke to Charlotte about it. They have to inject a dye which is very bad for the body. I decided to go at once on the modified therapy, which I did. I don’t know what you know about blood tests but one of the kidney function tests is a BUN, blood urea nitrogen. My read was 43 last summer. The highest it should be is 25. On October 10 th I had another examination and I found that the blood urea had gone up to 47. I decided at this point I would go on the full therapy. One week after I started the full therapy I had another test and my blood urea nitrogen was now 21.6. My uric acid dropped from 7.7 to 7.4 in a week and the creatinine, which had been 2.5 I believe, was now at 1.8, just slightly above normal. As far as the blood pressure, I had a diastolic pressure as high as 112. If you have above 90 you’re considered to be in serious condition. Five days afterwards, after I started the modified therapy, my blood pressure was sub-normal. It took about three weeks or four weeks, to come to a balance. I work seven days a week and I’m now back on the full therapy. I’m going to stay on it until all my tests are perfectly normal.  [Applause]  Charlotte: Thank you very much, Gregory. I do believe that a success story of this type, people that you can see that are doing well, people that you can hear about that are doing well, is worth a great deal more than all the theory and all the preaching"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #5 7 I could do. As my father said, all the theory and all the writing in the book would be entirely worthless if you could not demonstrate the results. It’s the results that count. We have the results. Thank you.  [Applause]  Norman: We’ll get into some questions here. Charlotte: We’ll try to make it short and take as many as possible. Norman: Here’s an easy one. How do you make potsies? Charlotte: You use raw defatted milk and let it curdle and then take the curd, break it up, mix it with a little yogurt, also defatted, with a little onion and garlic or spices to flavor it a little bit. Avoid salt, avoid fat and avoid ready-made things. They’re usually too high in fat or they’re already salted. Norman: How much of the value of the juices is lost if a Prescott Juicer is not used? Charlotte: There are papers that show how much of the mineral is extracted from certain vegetables and greens by using different types of juicers. The Acme Juicer, for instance, a centrifugal juicer, as compared to the Champion, for instance, as compared to the Norwalk. It showed that the Norwalk Juicer will extract anywhere from three to ten or even more times as many minerals and the Acme the least. Also you get more juice and most important, many of the enzymes are damaged or killed through the centrifugal action which causes induction current. My father found this not satisfactory for cancer patients. There is a question here also which I can answer right now about the Champion Juicer. How about it? The Champion Juicer does a little better job than the Acme. But if you want to heal cancer, it will not do it. You need the juicer as it’s described in the book. It has two operations. It grinds first and then puts the mushed up material under pressure in a press. Otherwise you get damaged juice, you get not the complete juice and the best juice. For the cancer patient we need the best. In less severe diseases and other non-malignant diseases you can use some of the lesser materials. For cancer we cannot. Norman: Is the therapy at all possible on supermarket-quality produce? Charlotte: That’s a difficult question. It’s possible but I would not suggest it in marginal cases, for advanced cases and metastasized cancer where there is a very shaky line between perhaps we can help, perhaps we cannot. If we’ve reached that point, then of course the best materials should be used. The difference between the organically grown stuff and the artificially fertilized will make the difference"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #5 8 between success and failure. It’s very hard to give you a clear-cut answer there. I don’t know. Norman: If a person has received radiation and chemotherapy what do you suggest? Charlotte: I think I mentioned before, after chemotherapy we have very poor results. Radiation and chemotherapy, together they compound the problem. These methods damage and destroy the very systems that we need for healing. They cook the cells in the liver that are responsible for detoxifying, the bone marrow which is responsible for the immune system. If you go ahead and destroy it through these external, highly poisonous methods, what do you expect? After chemotherapy we’ve had virtually no results at all. A certain amount of radiation we can reverse. Norman: I think sometimes we say that the cancer is often not a problem to deal with, but if you give the person a lethal poison, or a semi-lethal dose of poison, it’s such a handicap that we usually can’t expect much in the way of recovery. On the other hand, it’s difficult. I think there’s always some chance for life if the person is living. There are a few people, even with chemotherapy, who are living a number of years later. So obviously all of them aren’t going to die, but the percentages are certainly against them and we don’t have anything that we can encourage them with in the Gerson Therapy. On the other hand, we don’t have any research to encourage them much in any other way either. Vitamin C is one of the things that can destroy a certain amount of poison. Also, anybody doing research in this, perhaps they could use antidotes to some of these poisons. We don’t know what these are either. Is there a blood or urine test that can tell if there is cancer or not? Charlotte: There are various tests, some of which you may have heard about - [Some of the tests given are not as accurate as the ones now in the book \"The Gerson Therapy', please reference this book or see a medical professional for the most up-to-date information]. Various ones available.I cannot give you a judgment. I have no real experience. I have no really good way of judging how effective, how accurate these tests are. I do believe that probably the Nervalla test is the most nearly accurate. I would just suggest that you rebuild your body or if you’re worried about whether or not you are having cancer, just take care of yourself, get your body into good shape and quit worrying. Norman: There are always quite a few questions of this nature. Would colon irrigations or acidophilus enemas be better than coffee enemas? "},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #5 9 Charlotte: This kind of question usually shows me that whatever I said didn’t really sink in. A colon irrigation serves mainly to cleanse the colon. As I mentioned to you earlier, we are really not that interested in removing food waste or waste from the colon. We are actually intent on helping the liver detoxify itself as rapidly as possible. Colon irrigations will not do this. My father specified “no high colonics should be given.” They do tend to interfere with the absorption and re-absorption of minerals from the colon. When you read the book you’ll find this is described in there. We are not concerned with cleansing the colon. We are concerned with helping the liver bile system discharge toxicity. There’s a vast difference. Norman: Would this therapy help emphysema? Charlotte: Emphysema is a condition that produces scar tissue in the lung which replaces the normal functioning tissue. When this lung tissue has disappeared and has been replaced by scar tissue, that particular type of thing can usually not be changed or reversed. However, on the one hand it will stop the deterioration process. On the other hand, it will go further. Any areas that are still active or partially active, can be restored and restructured to normal activity. Also, by increasing blood circulation, by decreasing any arteriosclerosis and so on, by increasing the oxygenation in the blood, the patient will feel a lot better and even with somewhat reduced lung activity, will be fairly normal and in good shape. Norman: How would bread acceptable to the Gerson Therapy be obtained? Charlotte: There’s only one that I know of. It’s made by a company in Palo Alto called The Wayfarers Bread. This bread is made totally from one ingredient, sprouted rye, and a little water. There’s no salt in it or any additives or anything. This Wayfarers Bread made from sprouted rye is useable. Other breads contain salt or additives that should not be used. Norman: What can you tell a person who has spastic colon and thinks milk soothes her? Charlotte: Spasms in the colon are usually caused by a lack of potassium. Milk may be temporarily soothing. Milk may be temporarily soothing, for instance, to ulcers in the stomach. But they will never heal stomach ulcers. So milk could be soothing, like any drug might be soothing. That doesn’t mean it heals. There’s a vast difference. In order to take care of the spastic condition, you first of all need loads of potassium, as in all other healing. You’ve got to restore the liver, you’ve got to rebuild the mineral and enzyme and hormone balance, and detoxify, and you will heal. Norman: What does a person do daily to prevent cancer?"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #5 10 Charlotte: I think I mentioned that before. Lots of fresh food, raw food, get your body clear and keep it cleansed, keep it from accumulating toxicity. Live on the food that will keep your cells active, alive and healthy. Live foods, raw foods, raw juices. Not foods that will deteriorate and produce toxicity and toxic products. I especially want to go into the problem of meat. Meat is usually considered, by most people, to be strength-building and doing all kinds of good things for you and full of proteins and so on. Meat is not a good food. It has been found, for instance, by Dr. Ernest Wynder and many others that those people who do not eat meat who are vegetarian have less than ten percent of the incidence of colon cancer than the regular population that do eat meat. Meat is, first of all, dead. You’ve got to kill the animal before you eat the meat. Next thing, the meat, the flesh, the muscles, start to deteriorate and actually rot. Then you go ahead and cook it. That means you denature it through the cooking. Through heating you damage the amino acids, you actually kill two of them. So you do not get complete protein and you get a denatured actual putrefying protein. How can that be good for you? Meat is not a good source of protein and you should not use it. You should cut your protein intake to an absolute minimum to maintain your health. Norman: Is liver juice considered a form of animal protein and how is it acceptable? And where can you get the acceptable calf liver? Charlotte: Liver juice is not [indecipherable] as an animal protein. Liver juice would have to be looked on as being the source of a slight amount of protein in the Gerson diet and therefore desirable, but not for that reason. The liver juice contains so many products that are important in the liver - oxidation enzymes and probably some part of the immune system and so on. We don’t even know all the things that are in the liver there. There’s 3-6,000 substances. But they’re all there and they are important for the cancer patient. The liver can be obtained here in the Los Angeles area. There are slaughterhouses that butcher the animals from the Altadena Dairy that are usually raised very well, more or less organically. Those are acceptable. They are very young and very, very good. Norman: Isn’t it true that livers have a lot of contamination in them? One is that they store poisons from the body and another is that they collect waste materials and poisons, insecticides and so on. Charlotte: It is true. The liver is a detoxifying organ in the body. Does that mean it collects the poisons? It helps the body get rid of it. It doesn’t mean it holds on to the"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #5 11 poisons. In a young, healthy animal the liver is not poisonous. If the liver were poisoned the animal would be dead. This is a misconception and doctors support it. A lot of people will tell you that the liver is a filter that filters out the poisons from the body therefore it’s poisonous and damaged and you should never eat it. Well, the fact is you should not eat liver, but not for that reason. The reason why you should not eat liver is that liver, when eaten whole, is very high in cholesterol. We don’t want to get the cholesterol, especially the cancer patient doesn’t. He cannot digest and handle the cholesterol. Therefore we run it into the juice. When it’s ground into juice and pressed through the very tight filter cloth the cholesterol remains behind. Very, very small amounts of it go into the juice. Also, if any contamination is in the liver, it is usually tied up, whether it’s sevestrol[?] or insect residue, it’s usually tied up in the cholesterol. Through the fact that we hold back the cholesterol in the filter cloth, these do not go into the juice. Therefore the juice is safe, even when the animal is not grown organically. Norman: This is kind of a long one. Is there anything special to tell a person who has a lymphoma and who’s been on the Gerson regime since last July? She’s never had this much energy before. She plans to talk to Charlotte next July. “Never had moments of reaction such as Jackie Davidson describes.” She works at a profession and limits herself to two enemas daily, she uses no liver juice. Charlotte: Yes. Tell her that if she would use the liver juice and had more enemas she’d have much more violent reactions and probably a lot better healing. But since she’s apparently in good shape, it’s only a question of whether or not the lymphoma is arrested. I don’t know. I can’t judge from this question. Two enemas and no liver juice will not really produce full healing. Norman: This comes up sometimes. Did Adelle Davis know about you? Charlotte: Yes, she certainly did. We were often on the same platform. She spoke for [indecipherable] and so did I. We often sat on the head table together because we were both speakers at these groups. We had very nice chats and conversations. She certainly knew about me. I asked her one time, or somebody asked her, “What about salt?” She said, “It’s immaterial. It doesn’t matter one way or the other.” Well, that showed a complete lack of understanding of the total biological system involved in the body. As you know, she died of cancer. But she did more than that. She smoked, she used alcohol and so on. She preached “protein, protein, protein” for healing. Protein is very, very dangerous. Protein is a dangerous substance. When used in abundance or overabundance it can throw the body out of balance. I have seen more than one, I have seen at least four cases, of people who were on these high-protein reducing diets, develop cancer. Protein is dangerous. It can"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #5 12 easily be damaging and can destroy the kidneys. I have seen at least two cases after these high-protein diets develop rheumatoid arthritis. It stands to reason. Those diseases are diseases of inability of the pancreas to digest and fully break down protein. These high-protein diets and these additions of protein to your food are very dangerous. Cut protein down to the barest minimum. Why add it? Subtract it. It’ll be safer and healthier for you. Norman: Sort of a related question. It says something about the same direction. Do some of these protein powders such as Nutralite or some of the others that you can buy in health food stores, can these be used more desirably instead of meat? Charlotte: Well, I can only repeat. Why add protein? Why use substitutes? The little protein that you should eat should come from lean, predigested raw milk in such a form as lean defatted yogurt, lean defatted cottage cheese, unsalted. These things, in very small amounts, should get four to eight to ten ounces of these a day. That’s enough. What do you think I use? I use very little. A little bit of yogurt. A little bit of lean cottage cheese. Sometimes a little bit of buttermilk, if it’s not salted. You’ve got to watch your buttermilk. But very little. I eat perhaps one or two eggs a month. Do I look weak, like I can’t stand up here and talk? Protein is not desirable in large amounts. The less the better. Norman: How does the Gerson Therapy compare with Wheatgrass Therapy? Charlotte: Ann Wigmore is a very dear, lovely lady. She has helped many people. The Wheatgrass Wigmore Therapy is very helpful and very useful in many problems. She’s helped a lot of people that were not helped with orthodox medicine. But it is much, much lower in concentrated food substances such as vitamins and minerals and enzymes, than the Gerson Therapy. I’ve seen a number of cases, for instance, Jackie Davis was one of them, with melanoma, who did not benefit by the Ann Wigmore Therapy. It was not intensive enough, detoxifying enough, intensive enough in rebuilding. But she got well on the Gerson Therapy. This is not the only such case. In cancer, especially in the more malignant types of cancer, the Wigmore is not thorough enough, not detoxifying enough, not rebuilding rapidly enough to effect a cure. But it is greatly helpful, especially in the less malignant types of cancer. It will work. It takes a great deal more time because it is on a lower level of activity, less detoxifying and less quickly building. Norman: Can you cure sciatica or nerve deafness with the Gerson Therapy? Charlotte: I think the lady already has her answer she asked me. The sciatica is an inflammation problem which does disappear, of course, with the diet. Nerve deafness falls into the same category of damage to the central nervous system."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #5 13 Any portion of the central nervous system that is dead, is dead. Damage can often be halted and partly restored, but any part of it that is dead can no longer be activated. So it depends on the amount of damage that there is. Norman: What about combining laetrile or enzymes or some of these things with the Gerson Therapy? Charlotte: It’s all right. It works very well, especially the enzymes. They add greatly. As a matter of fact, the Gerson Therapy uses pancreatic enzymes to quite a large extent, and of course, the raw, fresh enzymes. The green juices and the liver juices, these are all enzymes. Laetrile also can be used as an adjunct, although I have seen some problems. I usually suggest the addition of laetrile only after the initial detoxification or else we may get into killing off too much cancer tissue too fast and flooding the body too with dead cancer tissue. So it’s best to start out on the therapy, detoxify the body and if still after that laetrile is necessary, it can be added. It’s not contraindicated such as chemotherapy and radiation. Norman: What can the Gerson Therapy do for overweight? Charlotte: A great deal. Of course the question is, what is the overweight caused by? If it’s straight overeating, it’s very, very easy to use the Gerson Therapy because if you eat a huge bowl of salad you can stuff and stuff and stuff the salad into you, you’ll get vast amounts of nutrition and virtually no calories. Also, you can drink the juices. They give you excellent nutrition and virtually no calories, the green juices. Some of the calories are provided in the carrot juices. You can eat vast amounts of celery sticks, carrot sticks and some of these raw vegetables and constantly be full. Never you’ll be hungry a minute and lose weight because there are virtually no calories in there. At the same time you rebuild your body. There’s nothing wrong with that. However, if overweight or obesity is caused by a hormonal imbalance or other imbalances in the system, of course then we have to adjust accordingly. Norman: Are there any clinics or any other place where I can get the Gerson Therapy? Charlotte: No, at this time there are not. Not only are there no clinics, but there are not really any doctors who are fully familiar and capable of using the Gerson Therapy. Meaning, in other words, that like Jackie Davidson, you are on your own. You’re not entirely on your own because both Norman Fritz and I will be able to help you to the extent that we can give you practical directions and advice in how to set this up, how to handle the therapy at home. But I will tell you this, when we did have a clinic last year, all we could do really is to start people out to show them how it was all done, that maybe for a week or two weeks or three weeks. How long did you want to stay? You were still"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #5 14 dependent on going home and continuing this at home. As I pointed out to you earlier, this is really a therapy that takes up to 15 or 18 months. So the clinic can only get you started. You still have to get your home completely reorganized and set yourself up. On the consulting and counseling work and on the practical direction, we can help you. Norman: What is your opinion of mega-vitamin therapy? Charlotte: Mega-vitamin therapy has its merits, especially the large amounts of vitamin B3 for schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a problem with the protein metabolism. Vitamin B3, niacin, is specifically helpful in the body’s ability to digest protein. So naturally it does work some. But, like many of the other therapies, it is not a restoring of the body and it will wear out after a while. Since, for instance, some of these diseases are problems in the protein digesting metabolism, it makes more sense to cut out the protein and get the enzyme activity of the body reactivated by itself, rather than to throw in extra-large amounts of vitamins. In other words, basically these are also symptomatic treatments and they don’t heal. If you want total healing, that’s not good enough. But it does help and it is a great help, and is a great deal preferable to the drugs and the toxic materials that are used. Norman: What results, if any, for the treatment of hypoglycemia and what precautions, if any, are there? Charlotte: Hypoglycemia is usually a precursor of diabetes. It’s a malfunction, poor function, dysfunction of the pancreas and specifically of the sugar-digestive system. This therapy almost immediately eliminates all problems because if you drink a glass of fresh juice every hour there are no hypoglycemic symptoms. If you can chew on carrots and celery sticks and if you detoxify, it is very easy to eliminate hypoglycemia. If you then stick with it for a while, detoxify with enemas and rebuild with juices, we can completely take care of the hypoglycemia very rapidly. But the same as in diabetes, these people are usually so brainwashed and so thoroughly indoctrinated on having to eat proteins, proteins, proteins, that this causes a great deal of trouble. They have to cut out protein. Proteins on overload on the already sick and damaged and malfunctioning pancreas and the proteins have to be reduced to an absolute minimum while juices and fresh, raw salads and vegetables and some fruit have to be used. Norman: For a person on social security without sufficient money to buy a press, doesn’t have cancer, she has glaucoma and diverticulitis and painful arthritis and aplastic bladder, no vision in one eye, trouble in overweight. Could she be helped by any part of this treatment? Charlotte: I would say any part of this treatment is better than nothing at all. It would certainly be preferable, for instance, to eat potatoes in the place of spaghetti,"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #5 15 spaghetti being empty calories and potatoes being highly nourishing. It would certainly be preferable to use some kind of fresh juice, even if it’s out of a bottle than say water or soda. The more you can do, the more likely you can have some kind of an alleviation or an improvement in the symptoms. There’s no reason why such a person couldn’t take enemas, preferably with coffee. I know coffee is really getting extremely expensive but in this case I think the person should probably cut out drinking coffee and use the coffee the other way. It would be very useful. Let’s have three more questions now and that’s the end. Norman: There are several questions about stroke or paralysis or partial paralysis. Is there any help that these people could receive from Gerson Therapy? Charlotte: When we have paralysis this is usually, again the same problem caused by damage or scar tissue or blockage in the central nervous system, the brain or spine somewhere. That type of damage can usually not be changed or restored. Here again, the central nervous system cannot be reactivated. When there is loss of function, that can sometimes be restored at least to an extent. New pathways for nerves or blood vessels can be manufactured. But that remains to be seen how far it can go. The most important thing is that A, we eliminate the cause and therefore the danger of additional stroke and B, we eliminate the high blood pressure and the person feels better and usually can be quite normally active, unless the paralysis is totally disabling. Norman: How does the therapy work to help cataracts and glaucoma? Charlotte: Glaucoma is more simple to illustrate. It’s usually caused by a tightening of spasms and cramping of certain capillaries and therefore pressure developing in the fluid in that particular part of the eye. When you can get the spasms and cramps out and can restore normal circulation the pressure goes down and quite rapidly. We don’t have much trouble with glaucoma. Cataracts are a little different. These are deposits on a part of the eye. They are possibly a calcium-type deposit or others of this type of material. It takes more time but cataracts can usually be eliminated or dissolved in a period of six to eight months, depending on the severity of it.  Last question.  Norman: How do you eat correctly when you travel? Charlotte: That’s quite a problem. Eating isn’t as bad as drinking. When I travel I order on the plane a fresh fruit and cottage cheese plate. That’s fine. But what do I drink? I"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #5 16 miss my fresh juices. If I ask for juice I get a can or bottle juice and it doesn’t agree with me. Water isn’t much of anything to drink and on top of it it’s often fluoridated. Tea and coffee are, as you know, also drugs. So I’m usually terribly thirsty and I don’t enjoy it. I don’t drink what they offer to me. The food does help a little bit in alleviating thirst but in those pressurized cabins it’s difficult. When you’re in a restaurant usually you can find a nice, big, fresh salad or you can usually find some fresh fruit. I usually go into stores and supply myself with apples and pears and other fruit and perhaps a jar of yogurt and make that my supper. In a restaurant I can always order a baked potato and a large bowl of mixed salad with just a little vinegar and oil dressing. It’s the drinking that’s so difficult because nobody will give me a nice, fresh of freshly-squeezed juice. What gets me, even in California and in Florida, the state of the oranges. If you ask for orange juice it’s invariably out of a can or out of a bottle or out of a box or container. It’s not fresh. That’s it. Norman: Thank you.  [Applause]   Norman: We should add that most of the answers to most of your questions are contained in the book. Sometimes it takes a little digging to get there, through that 400 or so pages. But they’re there. Thank you very much for coming. Announcer: Thanks for listening to this audio.

But you can’t get much closer to the beginning than to get the man who developed Laetrile, along with his father, back many years ago. He also, of course, has played an extremely important part in getting a lot of this movement going that led to all of our activities and all of us being here. It’s hard to place a value on what any one person has contributed but he certainly contributed a tremendous amount. Another thing, since we are in a way fighting a crusade, I remember the first little meeting back in 1964 when Ernst Krebs said, “Well, you don’t need to worry. When this crusade is finished there will be another one.” Ernst Krebs.  [Applause]  Ernst: Thank you, Norman. It’s good to be here tonight and Miss Charlotte Gerson Strauss speak on the perpetuation of the work of her father along with the assistance of Mr. Norman Fritz. You’ve heard a great deal during these meetings about diet and the Gerson method. Of course, it’s a dietary method. It is interesting as we survey these various so-called alternative therapies that there is a very spectacular confluence in them all. One, they share in common a dietary base. Two, they utilize the totality of pancreatic enzymes. The Gerson Method does, all of the other methods, including the Hoxsey Formula. The Laetrile Diet of course utilizes the pancreatic enzymes. All of them directly or indirectly utilize vitamin B17 or laetrile. In the formal Gerson regimen I understand that the use of nuts is discouraged and for this reason, of course, the apricot seeds or kernels are not actively used under the strict Gerson regimen. But there are fine alternative sources for vitamin B17, mung beans for example, particularly the sprouted form, are very rich in vitamin B17. So is millet. And again, the sprouting of millet increases the richness of"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #6 2 vitamin B17 or the laetrile factor. Lima beans and things as exotic as macadamia nuts, cashews and of course buckwheat is a very important source of vitamin B17. The laetrile orientation, or course, is a specialized nutritional or dietary one. We have underlying it the broad dietary base and this embraces most of the principles honored by Dr. Max Gerson. Indeed, all forms of cancer therapy, even the conventional or so-called orthodox school, are converging more and more to the dietary center. Dr. Devita at the National Cancer Institute just last week pointed out that the utilization of dietary measures in the management of cancer with conventional therapy is increasing substantially. In addition to the treatment or therapy, the Gerson technique is a method of treatment or therapy, we have the great world of prophylaxis or prevention. In this we’ve seen the role of Dr. Linus Pauling, twice winner of the Nobel Prize and his surgical associate Dr. Ewan Cameron of Scotland. We need not belabor the important of adequacy of vitamin C or ascorbic acid. This adequacy fortunately comes in part by the utilization of fresh fruits and vegetables. So those are the substances that contain ascorbic acid or vitamin C. Those substances, in their whole or entire state, also contain the laetrile principle vitamin B17. Now vitamin B17 is the nutritional term for the medical form of the molecule which is laetrile. You can obtain vitamin B17 is found in the seeds of all fruits on this continent with the possible exception of citrus fruits. When you go home if you choose to taste vitamin B17, just take the first piece of fruit that you can reach. The apple is probably the most convenient. Bite into the apple seed. You will taste a very pleasant, bitter, almond flavor. The same flavor, incidentally, that you find in Dr. Pepper. But the flavor in Dr. Pepper is produced by the addition of benzaldehyde alone. It is because the human species, or in fact most animal species, have evolved with vitamin B17 in the dietary that the flavor bitter almond is so universally appealing. I don’t think any of us find it repugnant. Bite into the apple seed, taste the bitter almond flavor. If you have the time break open an apricot stone or pit, the identical flavor is there. The seed or kernel of a nectarine or a cherry or a plum, they’re all rich in this factor. It is the contention of the laetrile therapist, those who recognize the role of laetrile or vitamin B17, that cancer at it’s base is like all other chronic or metabolic diseases, the cause or etiology which has been elucidated, is like all these other diseases, basically a dietary deficiency disease, a vitamin deficiency disease. In the entire history of medicine or science there’s been no chronic or metabolic disease that has ever been prevented or cured except by nontoxic factors normal to the diet. On July 13 th I published a statement in the American Medical Association’s “American Medical News.” This goes to 450, 000 Mds. I received a number of comments on that statement, but no comment questioned it at all, that in the entire history of medicine or science there’s not chronic or metabolic"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #6 3 disease that has found resolution by way of prevention or prophylaxis or cure except through nontoxic factors, water or oil soluble, normal to the diet. Consider pernicious anemia for example. This disease at one time carried a higher mortality rate than cancer, about 99.8 percent of all those who were thoroughly diagnosed as having pernicious anemia went on to die from it. Everything in material medical was thrown at this, every chemical, every pharmaceutical, over the span of time, over decades, without any appreciable effect whatsoever. The arsenicals, stricnea, iron, heavy metals - all these things were used to no avail. And yet the final solution to pernicious anemia proved of course to be raw liver and the chemists determined that the active factors in raw liver, the anti- pernicious factors were vitamin B12 and folic acid. Now there’s no such thing as pernicious anemia. It is preventable and it’s not necessary for us to give it much thought. The hematologist finding something verging on that just prescribes an increased concentration of vitamin 12 and folic acid or liver substance. So it is going to be in cancer. By the time cancer is diagnosed we’re in the 11 th hour, the 59 th minute, the 59 th second before the midnight death. The time to start is now. The time to start is with the next meal. Find people here eating their apples, great. Just go ahead and eat those seeds. You’re getting a little ration of vitamin B17 there. You decide to make bread at home, instead of turning uniformly to ordinary wheat, which is good enough, utilize millet, buckwheat, raw bean. All are very rich in vitamin B17. Indeed the old testament describes the bread that was used during the siege of Jerusalem and there were five components in this bread and four of them contained vitamin B17. This is 3,000 or 4,000 years ago. We have developed the problem of cancer because there’s been a profound deformation in our diet brought about by factors previous speakers have described. Excessive refining is one of them. The discarding of the bran, discarding of the polish from rice, wheat and all the rest denudes the cereals of all of their vitamins and most of their minerals. When you’re using rice, for example, use the brown or whole rice. The brown rice does contain some vitamin B17 or the laetrile factor in the bran. I’ve heard Dr. Shenk allude to the role of laetrile in hypertension. This is fine. Every vitamin has an extremely broad spectrum of physiologic action. This is why it is unsound for us to speak of any vitamin as the specific measure for a specific disease. We must look at vitamins for what they are - water or oil-soluble accessory food factors that if taken in adequacy prevent those that arise from the deficiency of such vitamins. I wish I could be as sanguine as some about the potential of nutrition, about the potential of all of these health measures beyond a certain point, but we are bound"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #6 4 by a very definite determinism, a fatalism the reality of which is recognized, of course, by the Muslim, by the religions of Islam. All of the cell rebuilding agents in the world and all of the rejuvenating techniques in the world and all of these things do not, unfortunately, appreciably alter the inexorable course of time. It would be great if those of us in the alternative health movement, in natural healing, could point to our people and say, “Well look at Mr. George Smith there, he’s going into his 101 st year and boy he’s eating his apricot seeds and kernels and he’s had his laetrile and he’s had his vitamin B15. He’s had his chelation and all the rest. He’s made it to 101.” The probability is that such a specimen will not be around. Maybe a Bernard MacFaden who jumps out of an airplane at the age of 88 and then dies, of course, at the age of 89 from a liver condition, which incidentally could have been ameliorated somewhat by the use of the choline group of vitamins. In fact, the vitamin B15 group. On the other hand, if you look around at some callous sinner who’s pushing 100, 101 and, “Mr., what do you ascribe your fine health, your vitality, your longevity to?” Winston Churchill was asked that. “Our Dr. Dean Perkinson, that class, smoked eight or ten cigars a day and drank when they felt like and so forth.” Dr. Shank pointed out the very important determiner in all of this is genetic composition. If you’ve been fortunate enough to choose the right grandparents. This is an area that is neglected in the rapid rush of life. We don’t give sufficient thought to the oncoming generation. Their genetic patterns are characterized by very early death and by early debility and disease rates. You notice families where member after member succumbs of coronary disease before the age of 50 or sometimes before the age of 40. In an overpopulated world we could well afford to discourage reproduction among those with a sufficiently sour genetic background. We certainly do in all other areas of biology. We are very, very careful about the genetic quality of the corn we raise, about the genetic quality of the turkeys, the winged turkeys, chickens and so forth. We raise them for broad breasts and we raise them for certain definite purposes. With the human population, up to this point, it’s hit and miss. It is a source of a great, great deal of tragedy. You see a family where Down Syndrome or mongolism will occur in mothers, not as you would expect up in their 40s, but in the early years. There are these genetic factors. As far as laetrile or vitamin B17 is concerned, that is my primary interest. I am not sanguine about the dying cancer patient. Incidentally, the studies that were done at Mayo Clinic were done on dying, terminal cancer patients. These studies proved that even in these some 178 subjects that laetrile, different from any other modality, was completely free from any toxicity whatever. But it is just beyond the scope of reality to expect a reversal. I’m sure the fine scientists at Mayo Clinic were not dull enough to expect a reversal in these 178 patients. But in testing, this is the preliminary clinical testing laetrile, you all can understand that if at Mayo"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #6 5 they chose anyone who had a scintilla of a shadow of hope of responding to any other agent or modality on this planet. If that subject received laetrile and died, the clinic would be wiped out with malpractice suits, with malfeasance and everything else. It was necessary to be absolutely certain that these are people that are past the point of no return and are dying and terminal and have reached that state in one of the finest cancer facilities in America. There’s the reality behind that. We don’t suggest that the laetrile there was good or bad. We really don’t know because whether it was good or whether it was completely inadequate, as some laetrile supporters urge, it would not have made any appreciable difference. The time to start in that direction is now and the place to start is on the foods that contain vitamin B17. These happen to be the most wholesome foods in our diet. Take these foods fresh and raw and take their juices. Invariably ingest the seeds of all common fruits. This is what is meant by wholesome. Utilizing the entire or whole fruit is wholesome, w-h-o-l-e-s-o-m-e. Holistic, incidentally, is spelt two ways, but it’s good to think of holistic as w-h-o-l-e, taking food in its entirety. Taking food as fresh as possible, raw and in its entirety and utilizing anything and everything in the plant or vegetable kingdom that is edible. In doing this we automatically get these important factors. The anti-hypertensive agent, the effect that Dr. Shank is imputed to laetrile. Many others have noticed this. This doesn’t mean that vitamin B17 or laetrile acts against every case of hypertension. But at any rate, those who have responded to the laetrile would not have had the condition in the first place if they had received adequate vitamin B17 or laetrile in their diet. I appreciate that the hour is growing late so I shall just reserve the rest of my time to questions from the audience. Yes, ma’am. [inaudible audience member] The lady asks is if papers have been written on the laetrile or vitamin B17 content of food plants, laetrile and B17 being synonymous. Some have and I’ve written a few brief ones, but I have not yet completed any definitive paper on it. We can be guided, and this is highly repetitive, by just turning to the seeds of all the common fruits. Eat those fruits and then eat the seeds. Forget the citrus fruits as far as the seeds are concerned. But every other fruit, be it prunes or plums or cherries, it doesn’t make any difference if the fruit is canned or if it is fresh as far as the vitamin B17 content is concerned, if you take the stone or pit. On this matter of the B17 content in beans, legumes. The content is increased by nine fold, 900 percent, by sprouting. We think that when we turn to unrefined cereals we’re going back to a really basic, natural state. This is the way in which we evolved. This may pass through our mind. But that’s not the way we have."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #6 6 Man has been on this planet over three million years. In this time he has engaged in agriculture, depending on the part of the planet we look at, we’re about 9- 12,000 years. Prior to that he derived his vegetable foods by foraging the countryside. When he did this he didn’t get wheat or millet as cereals or grains. He got these things as succulent sprouts pulled out of the soil. On this basis our evolutionary requirement for all these vitamins is established. So with vitamin C. Some people are initially appalled at the idea of swallowing 5,000 milligrams of vitamin C or five grams. Well, the aboriginal tribes in south Africa on their diet they routinely ingest 5,000 milligrams of vitamin C or 6,000 of vitamin C. That isn’t mega-dosage at all. That’s just getting back to normal biological experience.  Yes, sir.  [inaudible audience member] What’s the easiest way to crack them? There is a British nutcracker called a crackerjack which is a superb instrument. Lorraine Rosenthal used to stock them. I don’t know if she still does. But they are available from a cutlery shop in San Francisco. If you get in touch with her I’m sure she can get one of these instruments for you. They’re beautiful. In fact, I have one of them hanging on the wall of my office.  Yes, sir.  [inaudible audience member] Certainly you would have to break the pit or stone and eat the seed or kernel. [inaudible audience member] No, that’s quite wholesome. We don’t know any specific substances that it contains but if you’d like to blanch them it’s all right, soak them in water and slide the skins off if they have a food allergy or something. Male 1: We have a portable microphone if anyone has a question. Female 1: How many apricot seeds can a person eat without being toxic? Ernst: There is no problem there. Let me quantify this for you. The California apricot seed or kernel average is 400 milligrams. That means two and a half times would be 1,000 milligrams or one gram. The seed contains two percent of vitamin B17. So two and a half seeds would give you 20 milligrams. If you ate 25 seeds that"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #6 7 would be 200 milligrams of vitamin B17 in its natural context. That’s a formidable ration. One of the ways to handle this is if you want to ingest 20 seeds grind them in the morning, dry. Never add water to them. Grind them in a nut grinder or a small homogenizer. Then separate the ration obtained from the 20 seeds into two portions. Your first portion incorporate in your morning oatmeal or whatever you’re eating for breakfast. Save the second half for the evening. Follow this regimen five days a week. You don’t have to follow it with religious intensity because the metabolic products of B17 aren’t washed out of the system easily. Male 2: I’d like to know how do you remove the cyanide out of the apricots? Ernst: How do you remove the cyanide out of the apricot seeds or kernels? This cyanide is contained in the seeds or kernels of all of the fruits with the possible exception of citrus. But even there in south Africa it is contained. Laetrile, or vitamin B17, doesn’t contain, on a weight basis, much more cyanide than vitamin B12. See the chemical term for vitamin B12 is cyanocobalamine. They cyanide in laetrile is incipient, or potential. It is not present or produced until the laetrile reaches a source of the enzyme or chemical beta-glucosidase. This is the chemical that is characterized by the cancer cell. This accounts for selective action. Incidentally, one of the great things to come out of the Mayo Clinic study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association the 13 th of July, paper written by six of their scientists and clinicians that no evidence of toxicity was found from the laetrile or amygdaline administered. This was the pure B17. It’s nontoxic in its natural context. It’s nontoxic when utilized appropriately. Male 3: Dr. Gray. We have been very interested in vitamin 17 and vitamin B15. I’ve been trying for the last ten years to ask you a question which I have been unable. What similarity of the physiological effects on cancer on a lady with encephalous cancer, another lady with cancer of the breast and a man in the stomach? Is there any similarity of action of B15, B17? Ernst: Is there any similarity of action between vitamin B15, pangamic acid on the one hand and laetrile, vitamin B17 or amygdaline on the other, in cancer? No. Vitamin B17 is what we call a specific anti-neoplastic or anti-cancer vitamin. Dr. Linus Pauling wouldn’t denominate ascorbic acid as an anti-neoplastic vitamin. But certainly every vitamin and every nutrient and every measure that increases the strength and the vitality of the host causes the cessation of the cancer cell to be opposed. So these measures are extremely important. You have in the management of cancer on the one hand, destroying the definitively malignant cell. On the other hand, supporting the vitality of the body, which is the host of this cell. Vitamin B15, incidentally, falls into the latter category. Male 1: I think we have time for one more question."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #6 8 Female 2: If you’re getting B17 as a supplement in a health food store, how much should you take a day? How much would you recommend? Ernst: Pardon me, I don’t want to go off on a tangent or preach, but it’s a source of eternal frustration to me, the resistance that we confront with this simple matter of eating the seeds that contain vitamin B17. I’ll explain very often to some clients, “For two cents you get 200 milligrams of vitamin B17, by eating 20 apricot seeds or kernels.” Their reply is, “I’d rather pay 75 cents and get those 200 milligrams in a tablet or capsule.” This is an appetency in our culture that we are so pill or capsule-orientated. As far as B17 is concerned, if you’re not under active treatment for cancer, forget about buying tablets or capsules. Just get your apricot seeds or kernels or get the seeds or kernels from any other fruit. That is my counsel. I don’t expect all to follow it. That’s the way I get vitamin B17. I get it through food.  Yes, ma’am?  Male 1: I think we’ll make two more questions. Female 3: If you have apricot seeds in the shell, how long will they keep without going rancid? Ernst: If you have apricot seeds in the shells, how long will they keep without going rancid? When they are left in the shell they have a remarkable lifespan. I would feel comfortable with them in temperate climates. I don’t know if we’d call San Diego temperate. But in temperate climates, six or seven years. Even then, if the rancidity isn’t so heavy as to be abrasive to the throat, that rancidity itself doesn’t touch the vitamin B17 at all. It remains intact. Male 1: One more. Female 4: Would there be a problem if the fruit has been sprayed or if the fruit hasn’t been organically grown? Ernst: Would there be a problem if the fruit has been sprayed as compared to being organically grown? We have no evidence whatever that the herbicides or pesticides get into the fruit through the root systems or even penetrate the skins very deeply. I’m certainly subject to correction on this and I would appreciate any solid evidence to the contrary. I know of none. Male 1: Thank you, Dr. Krebs. "},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #6 9  [Applause]  Norman: Thank you, Dr. Krebs. Female 5: Then while I was dressing I flicked the television on. I was amazed and heartened to hear an interview on the education station with a famous medical doctor who had just received a very large grant of money from you and me, because it came from tax money. He was to experiment on cancer. The thing I was discouraged about was remembering that ten years ago and ten billion dollars ago we knew just about the same thing in the orthodox channels that we know today about cancer, which is very little. This doctor was asked a question and said, “When you go into a restaurant and you see a little packet of sweetener that’s not sugar but it is a synthetic sweetener, and you look at the reading on it and it says the Surgeon General warns that this product contains saccharin which may be cancer causing...” The interviewer said, “Do you think that really does any good to put that on the little packet that many people will use because they want to get away from calories?” He thought a moment, and I was happy that he was honest because he said, “I doubt that that in itself will do much good.” We should put the same warning on every processed and refined food. Let’s go to wheat for just a moment. In my lifetime, and in the lifetime of many of you here, wheat that was called the staff of life contained up to 30 percent percent protein. Do you know what the national average is today in wheat? Between eight and nine percent. That’s why it’s one of the top allergy-causing foods. Where do you think the amino acids went that are not in that grain of wheat? That are not a part of that protein pattern? They were never there because we have robbed and raped the soil. The good book tells us “Dust thou art, to dust returneth.” The constant recycling of farms that were once living to go back through the soil where they’re living in a different way and where they are recycled and come back in the form of foods. We don’t use the animal manures and the cover crops anymore, as your ancestors, your immediate ancestors and mine did. Do you know if we live the way they did that you and I would be getting those marvelous nutrients which our bodies know how to use and know how to put together to protect our survival? Survival is the strongest instinct in the physical universe. If you listen to your body that has a language of its own and speaks in many ways, even cries out, if we would learn to listen, we would know a great deal more about nature and about our own nature and the nature of our individual cells. We have billions of them. They are renewing themselves and renewing us constantly. As we sit here, participating, we are burning up and using millions of cells. We are making new ones. Do we want to make them out of good material or do we want to make them out of make-do stuff? Nature will beg and borrow, rob Peter to pay Paul, to protect our survival."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #6 10 Getting back to the refined foods.

We have a little bit of a [indecipherable] today because Dr. Sodi-Pallares is going to be using some slides and we’re going to be having a light on him and trying to videotape both the slide presentation as well as him talking. We are very pleased to have Dr. Sodi- Pallares. He is one of the most qualified physicians in the western hemisphere, for that matter, in the world. He occupies the chief cardiology chair at the University of Mexico. We have been particularly interested in his work and he’s interested in ours. He does many things in his polarity treatment of heart disease, but one of these very important things is the use of a high potassium/low sodium diet, just as Dr. Gerson did. I’m sure there are other areas of common interest too, but this is certainly one of the important ones and we’re extremely pleased for him to be here. Dr. Sodi-Pallares.  [Applause]  Sodi-Pallares: Thank you very much. I am very happy to be here. I thank Dr. Charlotte Gerson for the invitation to come here and speak with you. I read the book of Dr. Max Gerson this year. I was astonished when I found many similarities between the ideas of Dr. Gerson in his book and the ideas of myself in my book. Let’s see, first, some of these similarities. On the left side you have some of the statements of Dr. Gerson in relation with cancer. Dr. Gerson says, “The cancer cell is not a special system isolated from the living organism. They are united with and part of the whole body. Each part is important. But the whole in its infinitely fine order is more important.” That is the statement of Dr. Gerson. Now let’s see the statement in my book. “It should be considered as a whole and not dissected because it stems from a single metabolic hyper-function which affects skin, brain, bones, mind and the body alike.” Look at the similarity between those statements. "},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #7 2 Let’s see the next statement. “The one [indecipherable] metabolic disturbance constitutes the beginning of disease, cancer.” Now, my statement. “Angina pectoris and myocardial infarction are each innate from changes in the metabolism of myocardial fibers.” In both cases it’s mainly the metabolic disturbance because of the disease. Let’s see the third statement. “Doing intensive mastery of specialized work it was forgotten that every part is still only a piece of the entire body.” Now my statement. “Cardiac metabolic changes depend on general metabolic disease.” Again and again, general metabolic disturbance. Cancer starts, vital function and energy decrease, cancer increases. Dr. Gerson emphasized energy. Energy is fundamental for life. We have a molecule that the name of this molecule is ATP, adenosine triphosphate. That is what we call “free energy” which is a fundamental molecule for all the functions of the body, for all the functions of the heart, for contraction, for the pump mechanism, for the electrocardiogram, etc., etc. I say similar things. Ischemic heart disease begins with a thermodynamic disturbance. Thermodynamic, that means energy. Many years before the coronary arteries are affected. That’s a very important concept. “There must be more potassium in the organs, in general, than sodium,” says Dr. Gerson. That relationship between potassium and sodium must be maintained. And I say, “Intracellular potassium is antagonist between intracellular sodium in the metabolic and thermodynamic functions of the myocardial fibers.” Dr. Gerson says, “With the slowly progressing deterioration in our system caused by modern civilization.” I say, “In our experience the majority of these factors are important in the extent to which they combine with one and other [indecipherable] of what is called the 20 th century disease.” In other words, in some way we are responsible for our diseases. “The main task,” Dr. Gerson says, “of the salt-less diet is to eliminate the retained sodium chloride and water, in the occasion for salt-less diets. Potassium laws and potassium retention in chronic diseases, especially in tuberculosis, cancer, etc.” I say, “The objective of a strict low-sodium, potassium-rich diet is A, to eliminate the excess of sodium and water retained and to supply the potassium laws by the disease.” In 1944 I made a diet, a low-sodium, high-potassium diet, because my mother was in a very severe cardiac failure and my mother was receiving diuretics, the diuretics used in that time that were mainly mercury diuretics and [indecipherable]. Each time that my mother received those diuretics she became very weak, exhausted, with cramps, with marked ischemia, tiredness. She couldn’t eat. I asked my professors why you give those diuretics. My professors"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #7 3 answered, because we want to eliminate salt. ”Okay, why do you permit my mother to take in salt?” They couldn’t answer properly so I made a diet very low in sodium. I eliminated all the foods that reach 100 milligrams of sodium per 100 grams of food. That’s a little different with the diet of Dr. Gerson. In fact, we eliminate some vegetables rich in sodium, as spinach, celery, beets. We eliminate ham, cheeses and many other foods. I have a list for all my patients that are consulting with me. I give the list of those foods rich in sodium that are prohibited for them, according to the severity of their condition. My mother improved very, very much. She could live 18 years, a normal life. She was very happy. I started to use the same diet in my patients with angina pectoris and with hypertension. I started to see that my patients improved. If they followed the diet they were improving all the time. I told this to the cardiologist in the Institute of Cardiology in Mexico City where I was chief of the electrocardiographic department. They didn’t believe what I was saying. But later on came Dr. Hansley. Hansley had proved, many years ago, that infarctions can be produced from binding corticols with salt, or combining adrenaline with salt, or combining excessive exercise with salt - big myocardial infarctions in the heart, with normal coronary arteries. He called it metabolic infarctions and he emphasized the aggression of sodium and the protection of potassium for the heart. So I say, this is exactly what I needed to continue with my investigation. Later on Dr. Laboret in France, he runs a very good journal, the name of that journal is [indecipherable]. Dr. Laboret, who is still alive, he says, “To introduce potassium inside the cell when it insulin and glucose.” Each time potassium goes inside the cell sodium goes out. So I said, “That’s a very good approach.” I started to work with what we call polarizing solution, which is a combination of glucose, insulin and potassium that I have used for many years for my cardiac infarctions. This solution was not accepted at the beginning in the United States, until Dr. Eugene Brownwell, working here in La Jolla, made a very good investigation and confirmed our results, that the reduction in the size of myocardial infarction giving glucose, insulin and potassium. Remember that the insulin is necessary for the introduction of glucose with potassium inside the cell. Each time that potassium goes inside, sodium goes outside. That’s very interesting. So Dr. Brownwell confirmed our ideas, our work and Dr. Brownwell received a prize. He received near 100,000 dollars to continue his investigation. He is now in Harvard working. He was transferred from La Jolla to Harvard. He has continued his work in the same sense. At the same time, unfortunately, my ideas were not accepted in the Institute of Mexico in Cardiology and I was forced to leave the Institute because I was in a very bad situation. They were angry with me. They were against me in many respects."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #7 4 The ideas started to be accepted in the United States and now they are, some places, like in Virginia, Alabama and they have proved marked reduction in the mortality rate of myocardial infarction using our solution of glucose, insulin and potassium. The solution is used now in many places in Mexico, in many places of Italy, in many places of Spain. It still is not used in France, even though Dr. Laboret was the first man that thought that glucose and insulin and potassium would be very good for myocardial infarction. In the second slide you can see the normal protein. A normal protein is energetized, has energy, due to the presence of ATP. Remember I said that the main molecule to increase energy for all the functions of the body is ATP. This is taken from Dr. Ling. Dr. Ling and Dr. Cob that are in consult with Dr. Gerson, I know that they know each other, have demonstrated recently that using a metal that is called nuclear magnetic resonance, that the potassium is mainly binded by the proteins when the protein has ATP. The water inside the cell is similar to the ice-like structure water. There is a small amount of free water. Most of the water is absorbed along the protein. The protein is mainly in longitudinal form. When the protein becomes sick, particularly the protein of the heart that is named myosin, the protein gets disformed now. Now this protein has no ATP. Now this protein instead to bind potassium, it binds sodium. This water is not structured around the protein, alongside. There are many free water inside the cells and the cell becomes with swelling. That is abnormal. In this case sodium is occupying the place of potassium inside the cell. That’s one of the main indications of the treatment. First, to reduce the amount of sodium in the diet, a low-sodium, high-potassium diet. Second, to use glucose, insulin and potassium to force the entrance of potassium inside the cell. Each time the potassium goes inside remember sodium will go outside. I don’t think this approach has been used in cancer. There is the first suggestion to Mrs. Charlotte Gerson. Maybe in the future that will help some of your patients, to use the polarizing solution, particularly when they are in a very, very bad condition. I usually have many patients of infarction. I have had more than 3,000 cases now. I have very good experience in the use of these polarizing solutions. As I said before, these ideas, in relation with acute myocardial infarction, are already accepted. But in the last time I have been using this solution with the diet, combined with the diet, in cardiac failure, in cardiac insufficiency and even in case of refractory heart failure. In the United States they use for refractory heart failure mainly diuretics. I am against diuretics because diuretics necessarily produce lots of potassium. Even if you give potassium by mouth the potassium will not go inside the cell. Even more diuretics produce a lot of the extra-cellular sodium, does not produce a loss of the intracellular sodium. That is an important point. That is the reason why the"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #7 5 patients are taking diuretics start to lose weight but become dehydrated. The tongue becomes very dry and dirty. The diet, the main purpose of the diet is to [indecipherable] natremia. Natremia means the amount of sodium in the blood. The amount of sodium in the blood in 100 patients [indecipherable], before I gave the diet, was this. But after I gave the diet, the natremia dropped and was this. I know now when the natremia reaches values of 136, 137, pain disappears in angina pectoris. The blood pressure improves markedly and in many cases became normal, without the use of diuretics. That is an important point. Our diet is very strict. It’s very low in sodium. It’s only 360 milligrams of sodium. But it has almost four grams of potassium in the diet because we use very much a diet rich in fruit. The next please. What do diuretics produce? Diuretics produce a loss of the muscle masses. The person starts to become flabby and you see the reduction in the muscle masses in the extremities. That’s very common in the person that is taking diuretics. They look older because they are losing also the muscles in the face. It’s very interesting. They start to become weak. I saw recently a very bad case of myopathies, one a day before she died. She was submitted to four diuretics a day for eight years. Look at the poor condition of the lady, with acitis [?], you can see the pain, with marked increase in the liver. Look at the poor lady. Eight years with diuretics, four a day. Look at the condition. It’s terrible. I was treating her for one of the most famous cardiologists in Mexico. They are using the treatment accepted in the United States. I received many invitations to speak around the United States and I speak to the doctors, the cardiologists in the same way I am speaking to you. I tell them, “Look at the aggression that you are producing with diuretics.” Now, instead of diuretics, I repeat, for advanced heart failure we use the low- sodium, high-potassium diet combined with the solution with glucose, insulin and potassium to force the entrance of potassium inside the cell. These are the [indecipherable] that we obtain every day. In very bad cases the patient is started using more than three liters every day. There is a marked loss of weight because they are losing sodium and water. But the patient becomes hydrated because the sodium goes out from the cell with water. That is an important point. No extra- cellular sodium goes out. Now the intracellular sodium is going out with this treatment, with this approach. It’s another case. Four and a half liters every day and the patients is starting to feel hungry, strong. Rapid, in a few days. There are marked reductions of the liver. This lady came from [indecipherable] with refractory heart failure. She was admitted to digitalis, to diuretics and to muscle dilators which is the usual treatment used in any place of the United States. The liver was here. The liver normally where it must not be fit. But this liver was here. In the first day the reduction of the liver was here and we needed"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #7 6 four more days to [indecipherable] the appearance of the liver. This patient has a normal life. In a few days most of this patient improved markedly. This man, through the progressive reduction of the liver. First day, second day, third day and in four or five days. That was in February ‘79. The patient went to my office one year later, January ‘80 in very poor condition. The patient was almost crying. Marked edema, marked increase in the liver which so long use he was afraid to have cancer. I thought it was not cancer. I thought it was only the marked increase of the liver produced by the cardiac failure. So the patient has arrhythmia. Look, the pulse here goes very fast. Here it goes slowly. Different rates. Very poor condition of the patient. The heart was large. After a while the electrocardiogram improves markedly. Now there is normal rate, normal sinus rhythm. Now look at the size of the heart. I said to the patient, “You are going to follow the diet and you are going to receive insulin every day, just a small amount, five units of insulin.” He answered me, “No. I am not diabetic.” “No, I am prescribing you this not because you are diabetic but in order to introduce the potassium inside your cell and take out the sodium.” He says, “I refuse the treatment.” I answered, “Go see another doctor. You obey me or I don’t treat you.” He says, “Okay, I obey you.” He obeyed me, he followed the diet, he received the insulin and the improvements came markedly in a few months, two or three months. I don’t know exactly how many months, maybe two or three months only. I superimposed both x-rays to show you the diminution in the left ventricle. The left ventricle diminished from here to here, with marked improvement of the patient and the patient started to do exercise. He is 70 years old, an endocrinologist, a very famous endocrinologist in Mexico. This is the patient. A strong man. Good looking. Now one of the most amazing cases. You are going to see one of the most amazing cases that I have. This patient arrived to consultation, has double mitral heart disease, rheumatic heart disease with heart failure he’s 68 with atrial fibrillation, marked arrhythmia in the heart with [indecipherable] indicating the myocardial damage of the heart. I said to the patient you’re going to stop diuretics and you are going to start with a strict low-sodium, high -potassium diet. The patient refused and I said, “Go to see another cardiologist.” He went to see another cardiologist. That was in ‘68. The patient in that moment had 68 years also because he was born at the beginning of the century. He goes with the century. Now he’s 81 years old. He arrived to see me again in ‘74, with very bad condition. He said, “Now I am going to obey you.” “Okay, now you are going to obey me. I would be very happy to treat you.” We started with the low-sodium, high-potassium diet. I was forced to give some digitalis because of the atrial fibrillation, but I reduced the amount of"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #7 7 digitalis because digitalis was still the best drug when the heart conditions produces damage in the heart. So we are forced sometimes to use it, particularly in this type of arrhythmias. But fortunately with the low-sodium, high-potassium diet we may diminish the amount of digitalis. The patient was in marked heart failure, look at the size of the heart. Look at the plural effusion. A marked plural effusion in the right lung. I didn’t take on the effusion. I just gave the polarizing solution during two weeks in the hospital with the low-sodium, high -potassium diet. The patient started to urine and urine and urine and the effusion disappeared, in two weeks. No more effusion. The patient improves. The electrocardiogram improves markedly and the patient told me, “Dr. Sodi, I want to do exercise.” He was 76. I say, “Okay, you start to do exercise.” He started to walk. He was near Mexico City. Inside Mexico City we have a forest that we call Forest of Chapel Chapultepec where many people go to walk. This man started to walk and walk and walk, faster and faster. When he was 80 years old he was the fastest man in Chapultepec, at 80 years! He received a prize from the government of Mexico. He received a medal. He received a diploma because he was the fastest man. This was the brother of the president of Mexico, [indecipherable] that at that time was the chief of the sportsman in all of Mexico. This man at the age of 81 years. Look what a good low-sodium, high-potassium diet may accomplish in a person. You can’t imagine. This man has the skin of the face as if he were 40 years old. Marvelous. He does exercise, but sometimes he feels a little tired. I recognize it immediately. I have now so much practice that nobody can cheat me. Nobody. I said, “You have strayed from the diet.” Now, what happened in angina pectoris? In angina pectoris the potassium goes out from the heart and the contraction of the heart diminishes. The electrocardiogram shows what we call subintracardial injury pattern, that I am not going to describe. But the potassium is lost during the pain in angina pectoris. So I use the same approach - a low-sodium, high-potassium diet, insulin polarizing solution according to the severity of the pain. This is a patient with angina pectoris. Three [indecipherable] beats and extra systoles. The patient improves in two months, one day. The reduction in the size of the heart 16.9, the transverse diameter of the heart. Now 15.3. A marked reduction. The electrocardiogram of this patient improves markedly. It is not easy to improve an electrocardiogram. The other day they say here that sunlight improved the electrocardiogram. I disagree. The sunlight does not improve the electrocardiogram. It’s not easy to improve the electrocardiogram. You need to improve the metabolism of the heart. A person that is receiving sunshine, maybe he is out for a while of the stress and maybe there is a reduction in adrenaline action. That reduction in adrenaline action may improve something of the electrocardiogram. The aggression produced by the adrenaline action, that is all. A patient has started to make sunlight and the electrocardiogram will be back. That is not improving of the electrocardiogram. Improving of the"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #7 8 electrocardiogram can be achieved by a low-sodium, high-potassium diet. That’s different. I am not against sunshine, but I cannot accept some ideas. I am speaking frankly. Look, these T-waves must go up. What it means that the T-wave goes down means only that the part of the heart has lost potassium and sodium went inside it then. That is an important point. I teach that to my patients. My patients ask, “Dr. Sodi, what means this negative T-wave?” I am telling you that you have lost potassium for some part of the heart and you are retaining sodium in that part. The patient improves, look at the reduction in the negative T-waves, and later on the T-waves became positive. If the patient fails the diet, the T-wave will become negative again. The importance of the diet. Certainly each patient is different. You never can generalize. The diet that I prescribe is different for each patient. Here you have the negative T-waves. One, two, three. Now the T-waves are positive. At the same time with a low-sodium, high-potassium diet I prescribe cholesterol goes down. Those are cases of cholesterol that I have restored in my patients. Even I permitted yolk. The patients ask me, “Dr. Sodi, in the United States they permit only the white of the egg and you say that I can eat the yolk and not the white.” I say, “Yes, because the yolk has only 34 milligrams of sodium and the white has 340 milligrams of sodium.” Even I permitted yolk. Even I permit unsalted butter. Cholesterol goes down. Why? Because we have improved the metabolism of the heart and the metabolism of the general body. As Miss Charlotte Gerson says, you cannot obtain improvement on one small locus of the body. The improvement is total improvement. We call the polarizing metabolic general improvement. And triglycerides go down. I am going to present next Tuesday in [indecipherable], the last results that I have obtained in a normal glucose tolerance test. Many of these abnormal glucose tolerant tests, I am not saying advanced diabetes, but I am saying most of the abnormal glucose tolerance tests improve markedly with a low-sodium, high- potassium diet. This is during a fast. Look at the reduction in the glycemia, fast glycemia. Look at the reduction after one hour and after two hours of the charge of glucose to test the glucose response, the response of insulin of the pancreas to a charge of glucose of 100 grams. I have chosen only a few facts of the great experience that I have had during the last 30 years. As I told you, I made the diet in 1944. Now I want to say a message to Mrs. Charlotte Gerson. I am very, very happy to here. I am also very happy to see the marked improvement in many of your patients. But I think that you need to do something to spread out these ideas not only in the United States but in all the world. You need to fight this. They didn’t pay attention to my ideas in polarizing solution during 15 years. I kept on, kept on. I maintained my ideas. I"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #7 9 went to many places of the United States to give lectures and lectures until Dr. Brownwell started to do some investigation. When Dr. Brownwell, an American doctor, very good investigator, proved that we were right, now my ideas have been spread out in many places of the United States. You need to maintain, even many times you will be isolated, as you say. Even you many times will be disappointed, as you say. You need to call again and again to the American Medical Association. Send people to [indecipherable] our patients. You need also to call the Cancer Society. Send people to see our resource. If they don’t believe at the beginning you must maintain and maintain because the ideas of your father are great and it will be a pity that they remain only in the locus of the world. Remember that you have insisted that improvement is general and most of all, general to all the world. Thank you very much.  [Applause]  Charlotte: Dr. Sodi-Pallares, very, very sincerely, from the bottom of my heart, for taking the trouble to come here and to talk to us here and to give us your ideas. I was touched when I called up Dr. Sodi-Pallares in Mexico and asked him whether he would be kind enough to come. He thanked me for inviting him. Here he is, one of the world’s highest, renowned cardiologists with honors this long, with papers and books to his credit and as a former president of the Mexican Medical Association and head of the cardiology department and teaching. And he thanked me. I was very touched. I am very deeply touched by your recommendations to keep up the work I am doing. I will be more and more encouraged to continue it, even though we get vicious attacks from one of the henchmen of the American Medical Association. Just the other day there was a program that showed in Australia, dripping poison, saying, “These are all quacks, it is all fraud, it is not true that you can heal Alzheimer’s. There’s quackery in Mexico. They are running to Mexico because they cannot fulfill the scientific standards,” etc., etc. Lies, trumped up stories, defending their methods, defending their ideas. It is their living. It is their livelihood. And as this lovely lady stated, they are here to protect themselves and their life, not that of the public and their patients. In spite of the vicious attacks, lies and all the others, with the encouragement of all these lovely people and wonderful scientists like yourself, I will take your encouragement and statement and I will keep fighting.

Norman: There have been almost no medical doctors deeply involved with sunlight, or for that matter some of the full-spectrum lighting such as John Ott initiated the studies on long ago. He has written a book, “Sunlight could save your life.” This is available at the Gerson Therapy bookshelf as well, outside. Again, we’re not going to go into long introductions. So, Dr. Zane Kime.  [Applause]  Dr. Kime: The National Cancer Institute issued a statement that there’s a direct interrelationship between nutrition and diet and cancer. This was a real breakthrough, I felt, because up until that time it’s pretty well been denied that there is any relationship between what you eat and your chances of developing cancer. Many of us in this room have known that for many years, but when a prestigious body of learned scholars like the National Cancer Institute issues it, you know that there’s a tremendous amount of scientific evidence, experimental evidence that shows that there is a direct relationship between diet, nutrition and cancer. The National Cancer Institute stated that a high-fat diet was implicated in the causation of cancer, that the American diet had too much fat in it. Not only saturated but the polyunsaturated as well, were implicated as being a causation of cancer. The scientific literature brings out that not only a high-fat diet, but that many vitamins and minerals are implicated in helping to prevent cancer. A high- fat diet has been very seriously implicated in the causation of not only breast cancer but bowel cancer and skin cancer, these three different cancers and various other cancers as well. Americans do eat an awful lot of fat. It’s estimated that between 40 and 45 percent of the calories that the average American eats is in the form of fat. The National Cancer Institute brought out the information that it’s not only saturated fat that is involved, but the polyunsaturated, or the unsaturated fats, as"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #8 2 well. This has been a real revelation because, as you probably know, nutritionists have been pushing these polyunsaturated oils and margarines and mayonnaises as being something that is very healthful to you. Yet we find in experimental literature that the polyunsaturated fats may be more implicated than the saturated fats, as far as promoting cancer formation. Studies that have been done show that experimental animals that are placed on the polyunsaturated fats get more cancer than the animals that are placed on the saturated fats. This seems to all boil down to not only a high-fat diet but to many of the vitamins and minerals that we should be getting if we’re eating natural foods. By natural foods I’m speaking of the foods as growing. Let’s look at foods, just to illustrate this to you. Sugar is a refined food. You’ve removed all the bulk, all the fiber, all the vitamins, all the minerals, all the water content. You’re left over with a pure source of calories, carbohydrate calories, refined, white, granulated sugar. Other sources of calories that we get from our food can also be refined, like protein. You can refine the protein out of foods. You end up with gluten, which some health enthusiasts that are trying to get away from the use of flesh-foods, they go for these foods. But they’re no different from sugar in that all the bulk and the fiber and the vitamins and minerals have been removed from the protein and you’re leftover with a pure substance that is a source of calories. Fat is another good example. We removed fat from corn, from various seeds and beans and we end up with a very refined substance that has only calories and all the vitamins, minerals, bulk, fiber and the water content has been removed, like corn oil, safflower oil, sunflower seed oil, soy oil. These are all very refined substances and the vast majority of the nutrients has been removed from these substances. You say, “Well, what difference does it make?” It seems to make a lot of difference to the body because the body requires vitamins to metabolize these various sources of calories. If you don’t have these vitamins in your diet, the body has got to go to stores and soon these stores are exhausted and your body does not have the wherewithal to metabolize and utilize these foods properly. Fat is a special example that we can look at because fat has the property of turning rancid. If you take fat and leave it out in a warm room, it will turn rancid much faster than if you refrigerate it. Not only that, but oxygen is another thing that will help fat to turn rancid. If you expose the fat to the air, rather than keeping it sealed, it seems to turn rancid much faster. If you expose it to light, it also turns rancid much faster. That’s why they put oil in brown bottles many times. "},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #8 3 Let’s start putting this together and start thinking about some concepts here. Fat turning rancid. Heat, air and light contributing to fat turning rancid. What happens when we eat fat? Let’s say that we fry our potatoes in some corn oil that has been provided to us as an excellent source of fat to fry things in because, after all, if we fry the potatoes in lard or butter we would be getting too much saturated fat. So we use these beautiful refined clear vegetable oils to cook our food with. We take that fat into our bodies. You remember that the three things that will cause fat to accelerate and turn rancid were heat, air or oxygen, and light. In our tissues, are they warm? Most assuredly. Our tissues are just about 100 degrees. You know how hot it is when it gets 100 degrees outside. So we have that property. Oxygen, do our tissues have oxygen in them? They should. Unless you have arteriosclerosis so bad that you don’t have good circulation any more. They should have an abundance of oxygen. Your circulation is really your life. So we have that property. What about when you get out into the sunlight and expose your skin to the sunlight? Well there you have the other factor, also, that can help fat to turn rancid, accelerate the reaction. You say, “Well, so what? What if the fat does turn rancid in my tissues? What do I have to worry about?” When fat turns rancid in your tissues, it ages your tissues. It’s the very first step in the formation of cancer in your tissues. That’s why you don’t want fat to turn rancid. The polyunsaturated fats are much more active than the saturated fats and they’ll turn rancid faster than the saturated fats. When they do they will age your tissues and cause your tissues to be physiologically older than your chronological age. Not only that but they contribute to the cancer formation, one of the causing factors in cancer formation and they’ll contribute to every other type of cancer formative agent. As an example, if you take a cancer- causing drug or chemical of some kind, and then you get on a high-fat diet at the same time, it’s going to accelerate the formation of that particular cancer that is caused by that drug. Now vitamins and minerals are very much implicated in this because if we’re going to keep that fat from turning rancid and causing cancer in our tissues, we have got to have certain vitamins and minerals that we classify as antioxidants available in our tissues to protect that fat from turning rancid. Antioxidants, an awfully big name, but I’m sure you’re familiar these antioxidants that I’m going to mention. Vitamin C, vitamin E, carotene - which is also known as vitamin A but the carotene itself as a precursor to vitamin A has a specific action in the body in helping to protect the fat from turning rancid. It even works better than the vitamin E. Now fascinating enough, many of you have been taking vitamin E and you don’t realize why you take it. What effect does it have? It’s supposed to be the youth vitamin and the vitamin that regenerates you. In fact, all it does is protect the fat in your tissues from turning rancid and aging you. That’s the effect vitamin E has"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #8 4 in your body. Vitamin C also has a very similar effect. And carotene, again. We mentioned that sunlight could accelerate fat turning rancid. Sure enough we have a group of Americans that are on a high-fat, highly-refined diet that are not getting diets that have enough of these antioxidants in them to protect them and protect their fat from turning rancid. So we have a lot of Americans on a high-fat, highly-refined, western diet, getting out there in the sunlight. What’s going to happen? Sure enough that fat is going to turn rancid and they’re going to start coming down with skin cancer. Yes, we mentioned earlier that a high-fat diet was very much involved with the causation of skin cancer. But it’s not only the sun that’s involved in contributing to the acceleration of skin cancer, but fluorescent lights have also been implicated recently as maybe being more of a causal factor of skin cancer than sunlight itself. People come down with skin cancers where it’s exposed to the light, on their face, on their ears, on their nose. Yet when they go to see the physician to have those skin cancers removed, the physician will say, “You better stay out of the sun.” But he doesn’t mention the fluorescent lights that may be more implicated than sunlight, at least in experimental animals that fluorescent lights seem to stimulate the formation of cancer at a more rapid rate than sunlight. We’re not trying to get sunlight off the hook, as far as being an accelerating factor in the cancer formation, because certainly it can do that. If you’re on a high-fat, greasy or oily diet and you’re not getting the nutrients that you should be getting to protect that fat in your diet - the vitamin C, the vitamin E and the carotene - and you get out in the sun, certainly the sunlight will accelerate cancer formation, skin cancer formation. But if you’re on this kind of a program, on this kind of a diet, you’ll get skin cancer all over your body as well. But you’ll get more up where the sunlight can strike your face and down on your hands and things like that. So definitely sunlight is involved, but do we have to stay on a high-fat, highly- refined diet and therefore hide from the sun? When we take experimental animals and put them on a low-fat diet... We can take two groups. We can give one group a low-fat diet and give them extra vitamins, extra vitamin C, extra E, extra carotene. Then we take the other group and put them on a high-fat diet and give them their regular laboratory chow and make sure that they’re not deficient in vitamins, they’re getting the minimum daily requirement set as a standard for these animals. But then we expose both groups to sunlight. It isn’t too many months until the group that is getting their high-fat, highly-refined diet that they’re getting all the minimum daily requirements that they need that’s been recommended for them, but it’s not long before they start blossoming out on their bodies with skin cancers. The other group that has been on the low-fat diet, that has been given the extra vitamins, they develop zero skin cancer. None. They’re totally protected from the sunlight. So we have good experimental evidence that this is so, that sunlight really is not harmful to someone who is on a natural diet"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #8 5 who is not consuming large amounts of fat and that is protected by the antioxidants that they should be taking in their diet. Many Americans are not getting enough of these vitamins in their diet. Many Americans do not eat enough fresh fruit to get the necessary vitamin C that they should have. Many Americans do not eat enough whole grains to get the necessary vitamin E that they should have. And of course, many Americans do not eat enough vegetables, especially the bright-colored ones that have the carotene in them, like the carrots, sweet potatoes, winter squash, dark leafy green vegetables. These are the kinds of foods that we should have in our diets every day. This is good nutrition that’s taught in a high school hygiene class, about getting something bright-colored in your diet every day and getting some fresh fruit every day. Yet many Americans do not get this. The high-fat diet added on top of this is a direct cause for cancer. Around the turn of the century a physician discovered that infectious diseases could be helped by the use of sunlight. Dr. Vincent was studying tuberculosis, tuberculosis of the skin, and he discovered that sunlight could actually heal tuberculosis of the skin. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for this. It wasn’t long until sunlight became the treatment of choice for tuberculosis. Physicians would open up these big sanitariums and they would take their patients out and sunbathe them, day after day, week after week. These patients would come in coughing and hacking and emaciated with their terrible, dreaded disease. It really was a sure- killer in those days. It was as sure a killer as cancer is today. They could not properly treat it. These poor patients would come in and this was their only hope. They didn’t have any chemotherapy or any drugs or any concepts of other types of treatment. Other infection diseases, like staph infections and strep infections and viral infections, were also found to be healed by the use of sunlight. It was a treatment of choice. They had no other cure for it. Until the 1930s when antibiotics-- [audio cuts out] --globulin in the body. So the body can fight these infectious diseases. My friends, there’s many people that are dying today in our hospitals across the nation, dying from infectious diseases that we have no known antibiotics that will cure. The bacteria or viruses are resistant to every known agent. Even in combinations of powerfully potent antibiotics the viruses and the bacteria are gaining the ascendancy to the place where they are resistant to every known antibiotic. There’s people out there dying in the hospitals today because they don’t have antibiotics and the physicians have never heard that sunlight can truly save your life, can build up your immune system and cure you from these infectious diseases that will take your life. Yes, sunlight does build up the immune system."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #8 6 Following exposure to sunlight we can draw your blood and find out that the neutrophiles, the white blood cells, have increased capacity to engulf and destroy bacteria. A dramatic effect. “Sunlight? What effect could that have when it falls on my skin?” It has to fall on your skin. It can’t come through your clothes. Sunlight. Just the very physical act of old man sun falling on your skin has an effect upon the neutrophiles in your body that will help them to engulf and destroy bacteria. Another white blood cell called a lymphocyte is also stimulated into action by the effect of sunlight. It is capable of increasing it’s capacity to recognize bacteria and virus and it starts to produce antibodies as a direct stimulation of sunlight. We can take a patient and measure out a gamma globulin or immune serum in their bodies before they’ve been exposed to sunlight and then shortly afterwards. Draw their blood, look at the antibodies, the immune serum or gamma globulin, and find out that it is dramatically increased following the effect of sunlight. Those lymphocytes, amazing, they have got to be in full action if we’re going to understand how we can fight and treat cancer. Those lymphocytes are the things that can recognize cancer cells, realize that they’re abnormal cells and destroy them. Those lymphocytes, those white blood cells, are the cells that actually produce a substance called interferon. Have you all heard about interferon? I see many hands. It may be a miracle cure for many cancer patients, interferon. A substance that is produced by the white blood cells, the lymphocytes, and sunlight stimulates these lymphocytes into action. What effect does sunlight have upon cancer? A number of years ago a researcher did a study where he looked at people that lived in various areas of the country. He discovered that the incidence of cancer, the number of people coming down with cancer, was much higher up in the northern states and in Canada than it was down in the southern part of the United States. He published this data, very shrewd evidence, that sunlight really had something to do with cancer. Yet this information was kind of buried in the back volumes in the library and it just really wasn’t gotten out. The next study that was done was done in 1981, the first part of this year I just saw a new study done, published in the International Journal of Epidemiology, where a group of researchers found that the incidence, or the number of people that were coming down with bowel cancer, was much less in the southern part of the United States than it was in the northern part of the United States. They could predict the exact amount of bowel cancer by looking at the amount of sunlight that they were going to have in that part of the country. Areas where it’s cold and foggy, and where the people couldn’t get out and get much sunlight, there was much more bowel cancer. "},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #8 7 So this was the next piece of evidence that we had that sunlight was involved in helping to prevent cancer. There’s two mechanisms that seem to be involved in sunlight’s ability to help to protect you from cancer. Number one, and we mentioned it, the sunlight falling on your skin has a direct effect upon your immune system in stimulating it, increasing the white blood cells, increasing your body’s ability to produce gamma globulin and interferon that can help to protect you from cancer or infectious diseases as well. The other mechanism seems to come through the eye. Intense, white, bright light coming through the eye seems to stimulate a pathway through the brain, back down into the spinal cord and then reflected up through the hypothalamus and into a gland called the pineal gland. That pineal gland secretes a hormone called melatonin that seems to have a protective effect against cancer. That pineal gland is so important that if we take experimental animals and destroy that pineal gland, those animals become much more susceptible to cancer. Don’t we all have healthy pineal glands in this room? Unfortunately, not, because do you know that Americans when they get to be about 50 years of age that 60 percent of them have their pineal glands knocked out, they become fossilized, they’re calcified and we can see that on the x-ray. We take a skull x-ray of someone. The pineal gland is completely wiped out. When that pineal gland is wiped out in the human it cannot secrete melatonin that has a protective effect and also prevents certain of the female hormones from going bezerk in the human body and stimulating breast cancer and other forms of cancer. So you do not have that protective effect anymore. What keeps that pineal gland from calcifying? People in other countries, in developing countries don’t have calcified pineal glands. People that live out of doors and get lots of sunlight don’t have calcified pineal glands. But we here in America, we live and we play indoors. We work indoors. In a normally-lit room there is only one-tenth of the amount of light that there is out of doors in the shade. Our bodies think we’re living in a dark dungeon when we’re indoors. That intense bright light that is normally intended to stimulate the pineal gland, can no longer do it and that pineal gland, like any organ in the human body that is not used, it will degenerate and gradually become non-functional. You put your arm in a cast long enough it will become non-functional. It will become totally devoid of any function. You can’t even move it after a while. Anything not used is going to become unusable after a short period of time. So those two mechanisms, the intensity of the light, getting that bright, out of doors sunlight is so vitally important, as well as the effect that the light has when it falls on your skin. In addition to that there are many studies in the scientific literature that point to the fact that sunlight has a very exciting effect in helping to prevent cancer in"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #8 8 experimental animals. One study that was rather amusing to me, this researcher was studying the effect that sunlight had on causing skin cancer. He just got to thinking and he said, “Well, you know, this sunlight or the ultraviolet light, it’s got to be a bad thing. It causes skin cancer. I’m sure that it probably even contributes to internal cancer too.” So this researcher took a group of experimental animals that by hereditary they seemed to come down with cancer. These particular animals seemed to come down with lung cancer. We have a lot of people that are susceptible to various kinds of cancer too. They’re parents have had a certain kind of cancer or there’s lots of cancer in the family. So we do have these susceptible people as well as susceptible experimental animals. These experimental animals seem to always develop lung cancer at a certain number of months of age. So this researcher said, “I’m going to show once and for all that ultraviolet light will even contribute to cancer, internal cancer, not only skin cancer. This will clinch our theory that ultraviolet light or sunlight is really a bad thing.” So this researcher took two groups of animals that were very susceptible to coming down with lung cancer. He gave one group sunlight treatment and he gave the other group regular environmental lighting. They just had their regular fluorescent lights or incandescent lights in their regular laboratory. He followed these animals month after month after month. As the experiment wore on the animals that were in the normal environmental lighting, sure enough their tendency to develop lung cancer was coming through. The animals one by one was dying of their lung cancer. But he kept watching this group that was getting the sunlight treatment. Months went by and those animals weren’t dying. He could find no evidence that they were getting lung cancer at all. The months stretched on into years and those animals started dying of old age and they never did come down with lung cancer. “Ah-ha,” he said, “This is one of those fluky laboratory experiments that is meaningless. Just a fluke.” He wrote this up in the scientific literature. Another researcher said, “Well, this researcher must have picked out a bad model. I’m sure ultraviolet or sunlight is bad for internal cancer as well. I’m going to get a group of animals that always develop breast cancer very frequently at a certain number of months of age.” So this researcher took two groups of experimental animals that develop breast cancer and he divided them into two, gave one group the sunlight treatment and the other group got the regular, normal, environmental lighting that you and I work and play in. As the months went by this researcher noticed that the animals in the normal environmental lighting, sure enough they started getting lumps in their breasts and the cancer would metastasize and move from one area to the other and destroy the animal. But the group that was getting the sunlight treatments, they continued on, month after month after month, without developing any breast cancer at all. They finally started dying of old age. Well, this researcher didn’t know what to make of this data. But when we go back and look at the history of sunlight and its effect on"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #8 9 infectious diseases, and we see the epidemiological data showing that people that get more sunlight, people that live in areas that get more sunlight, have less cancer, we can begin to understand that sunlight truly does affect the incidence of cancer. I believe it has a definite affect on cancer after the experimental-- [audio cuts out] -- or the human has already obtained their cancer. Sunlight is one of the most powerful healing agents known to man today. Yet the evidence that sunlight has tremendously powerful physiologic effects upon the human body has been hidden in the scientific literature and has not been gotten out into the public because the public fears that they will get skin cancer and that they will get aging of the skin. Truly they should fear this when they’re on that high-fat, highly-refined diet. I have researched this area about the effects of sunlight and I have discovered many thousands of references that relate to the beneficial effects of sunlight in the human body. In my book “Sunlight Could Save Your Life” I have left over 300 of those references to document the experimental evidence that sunlight does have a truly dynamic effect upon the human body. Several years ago in the Journal of the American Medical Association there was an article published on the effect of sunlight on high blood pressure and surely when sunlight falls on your skin, if you have high blood pressure, it will cause your blood pressure to go down. It doesn’t go down maximally until about 24 hours following the exposure of sunlight, but then the blood pressure will go down and stay down for as long as five and six days following one single exposure to sunlight. That has been published in some of the most prestigious medical journals in the world. Not only does the sunlight lower your blood pressure, and if your blood pressure is normal it has no effect on your blood pressure, it’s as though a normal physiologic reaction was there to lower your blood pressure. If you have elevated blood sugar the sunlight has a dramatic effect on lowering your blood sugar. If your blood sugar is low or normal, it has no effect on lowering your blood sugar. Following exposure to sunlight your cholesterol level will drop dramatically. In one group they studied they found that the sunlight could lower the group’s cholesterol by an average of 13 percent in as little as two hours of time following sunlight exposure. The Russians are using sunlight to treat atherosclerosis with. They’re getting abnormal electrocardiograms changed to normal electrocardiograms. Angina pains are leaving following exposure to sunlight, multiple exposures. "},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #8 10 Sunlight is like exercise. You don’t get the benefit out of it following one exposure. Just like you don’t get the benefit from exercise after one walk or one jog. It takes multiple exposures, week in, week out, month in, month out, for exercise or sunlight to do you benefit. You need sunlight as bad as you need the air that you breathe, the water that you drink and the food that you eat. The scientific evidence is there and our bodies are desperate. There’s probably many in this room today that have an ultraviolet light deficiency that we could prove out in the laboratory. Your bodies are suffering severely as a result of this, from a lack of sunlight. It is one of the most dynamic and beautiful therapies known to mankind. Thank you very much.

[Applause]  Neva: All these lights! I appreciate coming here. I feel like I’m among friends, people who understand the body’s needs rather than the violation of it. I have 85 hours in nutritional biochemical research in birth defects at the Shriner’s Children’s Hospital. It was the most frustrating experience in my life, to know that all but two percent of those birth defects of nearly 500 children is preventable by diet. They could be prevented by responsible mothers, attitude, parental attitude. I’m deeply grateful for my Indian teachers. One teacher was very, very inspirational. I’ve had several. I wish I could convey his voice to you today. He was the one who taught me first about the living clays. He’s the one who brought me clays, brought them into my consciousness. My first exposure to clay, we were going through New Mexico in 1946. I saw some young Indian women making pottery. Two of them had babies on their back. I saw them, when the babies were fussy, put a chunk of clay in their mouth. I thought that was really heathen. But when I talked to my teachers about it, a few years later, some of the Indians that I’ve had the opportunity to study with, to gather herbs with, to watch in their ceremonies and to participate, I learned that this is a tradition. When I told Wind Dancer, who was one of my teachers, about that clay, he said, “That’s a tradition. It’s as old as man.” The young children receive the clay. Sometimes they would go long distances to find the right clay. He brought me little bags of clay. I puzzled because my mind has to know why. I have a scientific mind that says there has to be reason. So as I asked him he said, “You can’t go out in your yard and dig up dirt. You can’t go find beautiful sand. It doesn’t work. It has to be the life-giving clays.” Some of the science has"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #9 2 investigated the difference in clays. There are many kinds. The samithosite [?] clay is a living clay that’s come through geothermal activity. This is the kind that the Indians would seek. In southern California there has been geothermal activity in the past. Now they’re drilling deep wells there. The clays that come out of that soil are what we call “charged clays.” They have a minus ion. It doesn’t mean a lot to you but a minus ion moves a positively charged particle and all toxins are positively charged. You heard them talk here a few minutes ago about the energy, about a charged body. A person with various types of cell deterioration and malignancy in the body has a low charge. Dr. Valerie Hunt at UCLA is a scientist. They measure the body’s energy. The body cycles at 220,000 cycles per second. The liver has a measurement, the heart, the kidneys, all the endocrine and exocrine glands. We must give the body that energy to which it must work. That is where herbs, the plant life--why does one plant support kidney function? Why does one activate liver? It has become answerable through the energies of the plant, which correspond to the various needs of the human body. The clays, the significance of the clays is that not only does it move toxins but it activates enzyme systems. In the trace minerals the geothermal clays have had water flowing from deep in the earth, come to the surface and the continued evaporation has left mineral there that has been acted upon by the medium of the water, the soil, the activity, the gasses. It has left it charged. Then due to the heat and the drying, has left the ions open, the molecules open. The samithosite [?] clays, which come through the geothermal, have what they call a “flat surface” on one side of the molecule, of which the amino acid exchanges can occur on. So it not only assists in amino acid exchange, but it also assists in the movement of enzyme systems and the activation. Without trace minerals many enzyme systems are totally inactive in your body. Enzyme systems are a part of the immune system of the body. The immune system is a fascinating part of every cell. It must remain intact to protect that cell. As we looked into the primitive cultures, wherever tissue was sloughing off, the clay was able to take away, to neutralize, to take care of those toxins on the spot. When a cell deteriorates, when a cell sloughs away, there is some toxic material there. In your intestinal tract the cells slough away every other day. New cells have to be built. New cells could not be built without the assistance of the trace minerals and the enzyme systems. We have over 300 known enzymes in our body. Every minute the liver is responsible for 47 enzymic actions. The withdrawal of certain nutrients from the body impedes that. It’s been proved, been noted by the Department of Agriculture, that the amount of trace minerals in our daily food is less than a third of what it was when studies started in 1925. The depletion of soil, the chemical raising of foods, depletes the"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #9 3 plant life of the mineral it must have, or should have. We must turn to the herbs as a natural source of the unknowns. Dr. Roger Williams, University of Texas, has done extensive work on nutritional research. He was one of the first biochemists to isolate pantothenic acid. In isolating it he found 17 unknowns. Only seven of those are recognizable. Still ten remain unknown. He showed his films where the ionic structures, the potassium ion, was strengthened by the unknowns in the potassium ion, the unknowns in the plant life, to give power to the potassium ion. His work indicates the significance of plant life, the significance of returning to the herbal source because the herbs are harvested in natural soil. The herbs are grown without pesticides and chemicals. Even goldenseal cannot be produced commercially. It has to be harvested in its native environment. It has been over-harvested, so it’s harder to secure. But the herbs that are available to us, the herbs that give us the life-giving properties to bring the body rhythm back, to bring the energy back to the cell, and then the clays are useful as those cells reproduce and the old cells slough away. The clays take care of the toxins that arise. In natural digestion processes there are toxins that occur, which is normal. When something is transferred from the plant life to the next step up, which is the human cell, there are byproducts of that. In that condition those must be neutralized in the small intestine to prevent the toxicity of the large intestine. The clays support this. Not only do they contribute, the geothermal clays contribute around 60 percent of their ions are negatively charged, which is very, very important to the use of trace minerals. The other part of the clay, clays are high in silica. If this silica is in a bonded molecule, a sandwiched molecule, it will assist in the movement of calcium into the cell. Most of the American diets are too high in phosphorous. The American eats excess amounts of meat, cereal, grain and dairy. The phosphorous is far too high. The phosphorous attaches to the calcium molecule. The calcium molecule has nine atoms in it, which some must be split away and bonded with the magnesium to make it useful to our body, particularly in the nerve cell. In the bone, as calcium must be escorted into the bone by enzymes made from vitamin D, as well as the silica, changes the configuration of the molecule from round to oval and it can move into the cell readily and not accumulate on the outside of the bone and build up arthritic conditions. So as the clays are used the calcium becomes more useful. It becomes more available to the recalcification of bone. Reports have been done as early as 1963 on the use of the clays to moving calcium back into bone which had been thinned, had become deficient. There are various clays. Some of the early clay material comes out of France."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #9 4 Those works have a great deal of creditability to them. As the Indians didn’t have the scientific knowledge, they merely knew by being in touch with their own inner wisdom that the clays had value. Some clays are higher in iron, some clays are higher in other minerals. They used them according to that inner wisdom. The wisdom that each of us has can be heightened by the use of natural diet. People on chemical-ized foods, on what is known as the modern diet, have little awareness of their own intuitive knowledge, their own inner-beingness that can guide them. In illness we must be in touch, or we must have professional guides so to speak. We must have people who will walk with us and teach us and guide our dietary selection, control diet patterns, like the Gerson, which I’m quite familiar with. We had a number of people at one time in the area that I’m in, that I do nutritional counseling, there were 35 people at one time doing the Gerson Therapy. It was very, very fascinating to see what was happening to those people, to see the new life that came back to them. Some of them were not cancer victims. In fact, most of them weren’t. But we saw what was happening under a therapy that was skillfully guided, that had been brought forward by a person willing to be in touch with the body well enough to develop a therapy this useful. As we see people, I’m in a position to see people that have had the drastic chemical measures. As I was speaking, the children in the Shriner’s Children’s Hospital, it was tragic to see what parental influence, what modern diet was doing. The geneticists tell us if we don’t turn this around, if we don’t stop what we’re doing, if we do not return to listening to our body and its needs, by the year 2020 only one-third of live-born children will live to see ten years of life. I’ve been on the East Coast for three weeks. I just returned a few days ago. I saw a government report. It’s available to the public. It was produced at a tremendous cost to we tax-payers, that tells us by the year2050,unless we do something about our environment, unless each person takes responsibility, we will not have air to breathe. We must look at what has happened-- [audio cuts out] We must return to nature, to the natural air. It has been shown that in the environmental contamination [indecipherable]. We have dimethylmercury in our environment due to industrial plants there. I suppose you have some here. At Weaver State College, close to where I live, a Dr. Dale Graff has done many water studies and finds dimethylmercury very high. As the good man who just spoke tells us that we can take preventative measures. I urge you to do this. The air even that you breathe, maybe you have pure air here, but I saw some smog when we came in last night. The air we breathe is contaminated. We must give the body every advantage. The clays have been found useful in helping move these"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #9 5 heavy materials out of the cell, inner-cellular membrane, out of the places that they accumulate. Do you know that lead destroys the central nervous system? When people reach the aging years of their life, when they should be able to relax and enjoy the fruit of their labors, you see trembling hands, you see trembling heads, you see inability to speak clearly. It has been determined many times this is heavy metal contamination. My Indian teacher told me that there is a major protection from whatever the environment presents to the human body by the use of clays, but particularly in therapy. When the acceleration of getting rid of normal cells occurs in any type of natural cancer therapy or any type of healing therapy and we accelerate the sloughing of abnormal or diseased or renegade cells and we create an environment that new cells can be developed, be managed properly, clay can participate in this, not only by arresting the toxic conditions that arise from an accelerated destruction of diseased or abnormal cells, but also assisting in the enzyme systems that build new cells. I have not seen the research - it’s very, very limited yet - on the RNA [?] and DNA and the presence of the clay in transporting of the enzymes. But these are all worthwhile. Never has it been seen that clays are toxic. The Indians used them in correlation with their herb programs. They used clay just as religiously as they used their herbs. There is no toxicity. Nature does not violate. It is true, from the herb kingdom, 25 percent of the herbs [sic] on the market originated as alkaloids that they found in an herb, but they took it away from the plant. They took it out of its environment. They took it away from its assistance, from its corresponding factors, and synthesized it, make an alkaloid out of it. They isolate it. They chemically make it. This violates the body because it creates stress. Alkaloids from plant life have no similarity to the original alkaloid in the plant. By the use of the herbs -- there are many herbals on the market. Many of the books have very worthwhile uses of herbs on a daily basis. We must do this, merely to assist the body, to have the plant life unknowns. As you choose a wise and responsible diet the herbs will complement, the healing herbs, the blood purifiers. I’m going to speak at the Hyatt tomorrow night some about the nutritional herbs that will be useful in your daily diet. As you choose your diet as wisely as possible, yet it is impossible to know that it contains all of the nutritional support systems essential to a healthy diet. We are at an age and time where we cannot just use the daily requirement. We must choose our diet preventatively. Do you know that the cancer -- I don’t know what they call themselves -- the medicals, predict that one in every four of us here in this lifetime will have"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #9 6 cancer? It’s predicted by the year 2000 one in every second person. As you heard spoken already this morning, the myacins [?], the drugs, they believe are directly responsible for the children under ten years of age having leukemia. Do you know that’s the number one killer of children under ten? In the research area that I have been in, as early as the last ten years, we saw the stillborn infants, when they did autopsies, having cancer. Our children, your children and their children, deserve more than this. They deserve a chance to live a good life. When the parental influence, even the father’s diet influences the offspring. It should be as responsibly looked at as the mother’s during her nine months of carrying the baby. In the Indian tribes I have a little friend who’s a Hopi. His name is Warm Wind. They’ve taught me some of their principles. Do you know that previous to conception if they desire a male child, if a male child is to be conceived, they choose their diet ten weeks previously to predetermine male offspring? When I asked Warm Wind how accurate this was, he said, “100 percent.” Diet does have a profound influence, not only at the time of conception, but throughout the carrying of a child and throughout the child’s formative years particularly. I see children in pathetic states of malnutrition. Who’s going to hear them? I am not in the education system for that very reason. When I saw that the findings at the Shriner’s Children’s Hospital were such that we could not tell the parents that caffeine was probably responsible for 67 male children being brought into the world without any pelvic development, they will never walk, they will remain in casts all their lives, due possibly to the mother’s ingestion of chemicals in her diet during the fetal stage. We’re the ones that have the voice that can carry it forth and help people look at responsibility, not only for their own bodies, not only in the times of illness, to seek the natural healers, to seek those that work with the rhythm of the body rather than destroy the enzyme systems in the body. Chemotherapy prohibits new cell development. How can a body recover from the ravages of malignancies when its ability to build a new cell is greatly thwarted. The chemicals used in chemotherapy are extremely toxic to the body. True, they prohibit new cancer cells from developing. You see people given a short remission sometimes on chemo. But what is the tragic end? They waste away. The pain, the suffering. Death has no dignity when they have had chemo and the body has been ravaged by those chemicals. I have seen people who were not healed in the natural methods of cancer therapy, but their death had dignity. They died easily, without drugs, without chemicals. They were able to let go and move on in a much different way than under the ravages of chemicals, under the ravages of burns that I’ve seen. When I see the irresponsibility among our youth, our young mothers, our young fathers, in regards not only to their own bodies but to their offspring, I desire to let"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #9 7 them hear. That’s why I’m here today. In the academic system we do not get to raise our voices, we do not get to tell the truth as it is. Much is known. At the University of Utah where I’ve spent many hours, it is known positively what white sugar does to the adrenals, what it does to the glandular system. But this is not carried to the public. It must be carried by the voice of you and me. The facts are there. The feminization of the males, the weakening of the masculine characteristics, is much more accelerated when the diets are high in carbohydrates, like white sugar. I haven’t time to go into the principles of that. We must return to the natural carbohydrates, the carrot carbohydrate, the vegetable carbohydrate. It’s valuable. It’s necessary in the human body. But it has not been changed. It has not been denuded. It has not been made what we call and empty calorie. It has remained in its natural structure. It’s there where the body can use it effectively in its energy, in its rebuilding. The protein overload that’s so common. I see people every day that are protein- starved and yet their diets are heavy in proteins. It’s again because the body is not handling those proteins. They are not using the natural plant life. It’s been determined that the American eats three to five percent of its diet in a raw state. According to the researchers, Dr. Williams being one... There are many others. There’s a Dr. Duke at the US Department of Agriculture, doing extensive studies on colon cancer. He’s a black man and he went to his own people, his ancestry, and studied their diets. Those people had no colon cancer. Yet his father, two uncles and one brother are dead of colon cancer and Dr. Duke would like not to have it. His studies indicate the return to the bulk fiber, natural diet is assuring him of cancer prevention in his own body. He’s excited about the results, not only knowing that he does not need colon cancer, will not have it, but also knowing that his body is in a better state of health. He has returned to 60-70 percent of his diet in a natural state. Dr. Williams tells us the significance of this. Sixty to 70 percent of the diet for the human must be unaltered. It must be directly from the plant source as nearly as we can get it. In fact, the heating or the freezing or the cooling... For biotin to work in your body, you have to have two molecules of sulfur. Sulfur is easily destroyed or lost in refrigeration or in heat. Yet biotin is an essential constituent in your liver, for your skin. It’s essential to your brain. Without the sulfur -- this is why the use of herbs, why the use of plant life that has not been altered, has not been refrigerated, it’s why the instinct of the native cultures, the mother cultures, was often to dig roots and to take the bark of that root and to either make teas or to chew it. Many times it was chewed. Do you know how goldenseal came into use? By the way, goldenseal is a native North American plant. They use the yellow dye for basket weaving and for their"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #9 8 blankets as they wove their wools. They found any wounds on their hands healed very rapidly in the presence of that yellow dye. So they began to chew it. They began to chew the fiber and notice what it did to the mouth, the oral cavities. Soon it became a medicinal herb, highly prized. When the pioneers came across the plains to settle the west, they used the old sunflower for diarrhea. What do people do nowadays? They see the advertising. They see what the television tells them. “Go get some Pepto-Bismol.” Do I dare say it? Pepto-Bismol will make your mouth sore. They don’t go out and pick a sunflower. Sometimes when people call me in the middle of the night, in a desperate need... One lady not so long ago called me because the bowel was bleeding. I’m sure what progressed out of that could have been very serious if she hadn’t of sought help. I asked her what herbs she had and she said she didn’t have many but her mother had left some downstairs. I said,” Go see what you’ve got.” She had some mullet. It was only ten years old. I said, “Use it.” We told her how to make it in the boiled milk. It stopped the bleeding immediately and she shook her head and said, “How can this be?” You see, things do work. Clay is of a special value to those kind of conditions - in diarrhea, in hemorrhoids, in irritation of the colon. The clay will help neutralize those acids. We Americans do a lot of foolish things. We eat too rapidly. We do not chew our bread products and salivate them well, which the enzymes of the saliva take care of that complex carbohydrate. Instead we eat soft and sweet breads. So the instinct to chew them is bypassed. Notice if you eat a wholegrain bread, chew it well, how sweet it gets. This is the way it was meant to be. But we take water and wash everything down. We violate our foods. We’re to chew them well. We’re to let the peristaltic wave carry the food to the stomach and open the stomach and close the pylorus so that the gastric juices act upon the proteins. We bypass that. Do you know how to get our instincts back? It’s to use natural plant life, to use the herbs, to incorporate the clays. Clay is an assistant to the enzyme systems, when it is the right clays. There are some clays on the market that are mind clays. They have different constituents. They do not have the ionic charge. The ions do not have the minus charge. They do not have the type of structure that stimulates the enzyme systems. Much of our illness originates from the destruction of enzymes. That’s one of the things the myacins do, is destroy enzymes. They thwart our immune system. They disturb the natural rhythms of the body. Other drugs also. When people come to me with ailments the first question I ask them is, “What drugs are you on?” As we can withhold the drugs, withdraw the drugs, by their own choosing, and place them on the natural plant life, then we begin to get assistance. Use of the clays becomes a part of the therapy. For any of you the use of the clays, the living clays that are available to you, are a tremendous part of"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #9 9 the assistance in a natural program. The rebuilding of the colon, which is one of the most abused organs in the elimination system, comes about slowly. But it comes about.

Norman: ...Influential person in developing thyroid therapy. We’re particularly interested in it and the Gerson Therapy because thyroid therapy is a very important part of the Gerson Therapy. Dr. Gerson used it in many of his patients. Dr. Barnes, who’s going to be your next speaker, points out that approximately 40 percent of the people are suffering from low thyroid function. We think, at least among the patients we see, that it’s considerably higher than 40 percent because we think almost all of them have some deficiency of thyroid function. I’d like to introduce to you the foremost expert in the world on thyroid therapy, Dr. Rhoda Barnes.  [Applause]  Dr. Barnes: Thank you, Norman. I asked Norman how long I was supposed to speak and he said, “Forty minutes.” If you’ve tried to condense 51 years into 40 minutes you know the problem facing me at the present time. But I’ll hit a few of the highlights for you, I hope. The thyroid gets very little attention during medical education. I think it got more 51 years ago when I started than what it does today. I taught the course for five years and we spent at least one to two weeks on the thyroid. Today, if the student gets two hours of lectures on the thyroid he’s lucky. So many other things that are new have come in to be with the result that the thyroid has been cut short. Now this interesting little piece of meat lies in the straddle of your throat, your windpipe, up here by the atom’s apple. It weighs, in an ordinary individual, a little less than an ounce. I’ve seen patients in Europe where the thyroid is enlarged and it weighed eight pounds. How’d you like to have a newborn baby hanging around your neck 24 hours a day? That enlargement is due to the fact that the thyroid function was low and more cells were built up trying to produce more hormone. If there isn’t enough for the normal number of cells there won’t be enough for"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #9 2 several times that many cells. What the thyroid does, very briefly, is to regulate the rate at which each cell in your body, all the way from the hair on your head to your toe nails, burns the food that you eat to give you energy for life. Without this combustion -- the thyroid acts very much like a carburetor on your automobile. It mixes the air and the fuel. The thyroid regulates the rate at which combustion will take care of in your body. Since every cell in the body needs it, it’s not surprising that many, many of the body functions are affected when the thyroid is low. Let me get this watch out here. I’ll get about a third of the way done and Norman will be up here with a club. I’ll mention, very briefly, some of the outstanding places where the thyroid is involved in your body functions and then we’ll go to specific diseases, winding up with cancer which is the main program of the day, to my knowledge. The thyroid is important even before you’re born. If your prospective mother, we better begin with the new bride, has a low thyroid function, she may never give rise to the offspring. Sterility is due to low thyroid function more times than all of the rest of them put together. Furthermore, her menstrual periods would not have started when they should had her thyroid function been low. I have one case among over 4,000 that I’ve seen, whose menstrual periods began at the age of five, believe it or not. This little girl developed breasts, developed hair on her body, developed menstruation at the age of five. Many years ago the first one of these was recorded in the literature, it’s been at least 40 years ago. The doctor at that time was a little smarter than we are today because he said, “This kid has a low thyroid.” Whereupon he put her on some thyroid therapy. Promptly the periods stopped, the breasts regressed, the body hair disappeared, until the time of puberty. If you can find two doctors in the state of California that know this, that haven’t heard me talk about it, I’ll buy you a drink. That’s how far back our knowledge of thyroid deficiency and menstrual problems go. About three out of five girls will have menstrual pain with periods. I had the opportunity years ago to study a group of college girls, beautiful guinea pigs that fed themselves and cleaned their own cages to experimental work called [indecipherable]. Among these girls that’s where I worked out the basal temperature technique. It was on the college students. Nine out of ten could get rid of her cramps with nothing but bringing her thyroid function up to normal. Those that are sterile, there’s nothing better for them today than thyroid first. That’s not behind all of them, but more of them are due to low thyroid than anything else. Miscarriages. I had one girl that had four miscarriages. Came in to me and it was obvious she had a low thyroid. I gave her some thyroid and she promptly got pregnant three times in a row and then came back, “Oh God, what"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #9 3 do I do now?” Sometimes you can get a good thing started and it’s hard to stop. Women will go through menopause much easier if the thyroid function is normal. They’ll need a lot less of the hormones and you’ll avoid many, many other difficulties. Since the thyroid affects everything else it affects the brain. Our mental problems today, I would say over half of them are due to thyroid deficiency. After 44 years in general practice where you see everything from the ground up, I referred only one patient to a psychiatrist. She committed suicide one summer when I was gone to Europe. So I think maybe she way a little off. But that was the only patient that I saw that thyroid therapy would not correct her mental problems to where they could get along quite well. You’ve seen the hyperactive kids. Those are mentally-disturbed little fellows. They can’t sit still. They can’t go to school, regular school, because they can’t stay in the seat, bothering the whole class. Believe it or not, the majority of these are low in thyroid function. The first one that I saw at the age of 12 had been in a special school all that time. When he hit the office, the bric-a-bracs from all over the world on display there in the office, he touched everything in that room inside of two minutes and was heading for the next room to touch everything there. They’ve just got to get their hands on it. Once they touch it, that’s all they want. It took about three months until he was ready for regular school and became a very good student. The majority of those that I have seen, maybe the others don’t come to me, are markedly relieved. Growth, of course, is important. Tiny creatons, that you’ll see in pictures from Europe, where thyroid deficiency has been known longer than any place else, they are low. But the thyroid is a paradox. Yes, if it’s markedly reduced at the time of birth and continues, they may never get more than about three feet high and their brain gets about the same height, correspondingly, because the mental problems are affected. On the other hand, if the thyroid is mildly deficient, not to marked, they’ll keep growing and they’ll grow and they’ll grow. Those clowns can get a million dollars for playing basketball. I resent every last one of them. I still have to work for a living. Why should this gland be responsible for both the dwarf and the exceptionally tall? Well, the growth process is turned off in the long bones, just below the hips, by thyroid activity. If it isn’t up to snuff at the time, then those bones keep growing. They reach six and a half, seven feet, seven and a half feet and they’re very handle under a basketball hoop, I can assure you. They’re a thyroid deficiency when they get that high. I haven’t seen one patient over six feet tall in my practice of over 40 years that wasn’t a low thyroid. Some of you tall clowns don’t believe that, go home and take your temperature before you get up tomorrow morning. You’ll find it’s low. "},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #9 4 This temperature test has been the most effective that I have found in my work. Basal metabolism test used to be the one that was used all the time. It was pretty good if the patient would relax. It was performed by putting a clothespin on your nose, stuffing a rubber tube in your mouth and say, “Now just relax. We’re going to measure your oxygen for four minutes.” Try it sometime. It isn’t so easy to relax. But we always had to take the temperature at the time, to see if they weren’t running any fever. One area of fever will raise your metabolism ten percent. It was running several thousand of these on college students that I observed that the temperature was always low and corresponded with the patients symptoms, regardless of the amount of oxygen burned. I could rule out that nervous energy by having them take their temperature at home before they get out of bed in the morning, have the thermometer shaken down well, put it on the nightstand by the bed and as soon as you wake up, reach up and get it, put it in your armpit for ten minutes with a clock. In the event nature calls you better go in the bathroom and not have to wash the linen, but it’ll raise your temperature a little. But it won’t raise it too much. A basal temperature will give you more index about it than anything else. These various symptoms, there’s only 100 of them and I’ll recite them all here in the next few minutes - two or three of them, I mean. Fatigue is the outstanding one. These people are chronically tired. Before I leave that temperature a minute, I’ve got to tell you girls that you girls will do this every month with your temperature. It reaches the high point about the time the period begins and it reaches the low point when the egg breaks. So in order to compare your temperature with the rest of us little boys, you have to take it on the second and third day of your menstrual period. At other times you’ll be completely off the curve. All right, fatigue is outstanding. They need a lot of sleep. In fact, they’ll get up the next morning, after eight hours of sleep, as tired as they were when they went to bed. The common expression is, “I’m tired of being tired.” I don’t blame them because they are. Their blood pressure is characteristically low, although I’ll have to tell you that in older individuals high blood pressures that are very high, getting up to the danger point, 80 percent of those are due to low thyroid and 80 percent of them will come down to normal on nothing but thyroid. Thyroid is a lot cheaper than the drugs for hypertension, so try it first. If it doesn’t work you still have the drugs left to go to them. Dry skin is characteristic. I saw a wack during the Korean War. I was in the military twice. It blows up your ego quite a bit to think they can’t fight a war without you and they have to call you back. I got out of the reserves when I left the last time and they didn’t get me for Vietnam. But this wack had the skin on her legs was just like a fish skin. If any boy ever laid a hand on that leg, he’d have gone down instead of up, I assure you. I don’t think I’ve ever had a happier"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #9 5 patient than that girl when the thyroid cleared up that skin and she had that schoolgirl complexion that you love to touch but don’t dare. Falling hair, dry hair. All of the falling hair is not due to that but many of them are, especially if the hair falls out in little areas, alopecia areata, areas. Loss of hair. Those are usually low thyroid and they’ll straighten out on therapy. The mental we mentioned, the menstrual we mentioned, the growth we mentioned, but there’s lots of others we haven’t and we can’t take time for them because we’ve got to go on to two or three other things. When I entered school, way back in the mid-30s, I really began in 1930, tuberculosis was the leading cause of death. In fact, my mother died with it when I was six years old. Many other mothers did, and other people. Today tuberculosis is only prevalent in areas where we have not had good medical care. Tuberculosis was stopped, by and large, we helped it some with the sanitariums and isolation, but it wasn’t stopped until 1945 when the antibiotics came out. I went over to Europe every year for 25 years to study the autopsy protocols. Marie Theresa, the old renowned empress of Austria passed a law a little over 200 years ago that anyone dying in the hospital gets an autopsy period. I had an impression that those autopsies would give us the answer to heart attacks. That’s why I’ve gone over there so long and I’m still going. I went this past summer and I’m going next summer to get some more data. I can learn more from those autopsies in a month than I can here at home in five years. I found when I got over there that the Austrian diet was about the same of ours. You’re all aware of the debate we’ve got over heart attacks and cholesterol and the fats. I knew that was all bunk because of an old farmer boy, all my ancestors had been farmers, and in those days all we had to eat was cholesterol foods - the milk, cream, butter and meat. We’d fry the sausage down in the winter when you could butcher, fry it down in lard and we had fresh meat all summer that we couldn’t have before the refrigerator came in. In spite of generation after generation eating a much higher cholesterol diet than the average, we’re talking about 1950, we’re still waiting for the first heart attack in our family. So I went over to Europe to see if the autopsies would throw some light and indeed they did. That’s the basis of one of the books here, “Solve the Riddle of Heart Attacks.” The Austrians’ diet is very similar to the American. Yet when I got over there and began looking at how many died from heart attacks, there were fewer than what we had here at home, yet they were eating about like we were. Then the next question, “Why are they dying?” It was tuberculosis that was doing it. In fact, the average age of survival for the tubercular in Austria was about 36 years. Of course, that’s awful early for a heart attack. From Munich, Germany in 1918 came a report that I happened to run into saying that the tubercular patient had a far advanced damage or atherosclerosis to the"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #9 6 arteries in the entire body. I found that was true there at Gratz. These people had far more damage to their arteries than what we were having here at home. When they died at 36 from tuberculosis, we’ll take the male for example, his arteries were so far advanced if he’d lived two years longer he’d have had a heart attack. That was proven to be the case because the antibiotics came out in 1945. Now when we examine a death that died from a heart attack only two years later, by’47, heart attacks were rising rapidly in the Austrian autopsies. Now this fellow died with a heart attack but when we looked at his lungs in the autopsy protocol, he had healing tuberculosis going on in his lungs. These two diseases were competing very rabidly for the death of each one of the individuals in our society. As long as we had no effective treatment for tuberculosis it won. When it came out then came the heart attacks and they’ve come right straight up since. So there’s no question that the heart attacks are not due to something you eat, not due to the fat in your diet. I have my bacon and eggs every morning and I have all my life. My father did the same thing and he died at 84 and he didn’t die with a heart attack. You just as well pour that thick cream on your berries. There’s nothing any better. Put plenty of butter on your vegetables and get in some of that good, old- fashioned fat. It’ll help keep your weight down because the low thyroid individual tends to be a little heavy. He’s not burning up as much food. When you get more fat in your diet the stomach empties slower and you can lose weight. I’m throwing in these few remarks for those other fat girls in the crowd besides me because you’re always looking for the answer. The answer is that you’re eating too much starch. The farmer’s have known for years that you fatten a hog on corn. I tried fattening them on fat, just to disprove this fat theory. When you give a hog all the fat he wants, and he loves it, you could put a piece of suet in your pocket and walk through the pigpen and they can smell it and they’ll follow you screaming like the kids after the pied piper. I gave them a little more fat each day, not to upset their stomach, and when they began to leave some of the fat, wouldn’t eat it all up, I couldn’t put an ounce on a hog. If you can spoil a hog’s appetite you can spoil anybody’s appetite if you get enough fat in there. All right, so much for heart attacks. We better leave those. The answer to it, of course, today is to diagnose the thyroid deficiency early. We took over 2,000 patients that had a high cholesterol, put them on nothing but thyroid, which reduces the cholesterol, and sat around to see how many of them would die. At the end of 20 years... We had the Framingham study from Massachusetts to compare them with, the Framingham study took 20 million dollars of the taxpayer’s money to try to prove that cholesterol was dangerous. But when I put them on thyroid, followed them for 20 years as they did at the Framingham study, matched everything possible with them, we reduced the number of heart attacks by just 92 percent. That doesn’t leave a very good story for Mr. Cholesterol. "},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #9 7 Let’s take another disease. Let’s take diabetes for a moment. Diabetes, you’re going to be aware of this more and more because the paper mill, the propaganda mill in Washington, has picked up diabetes as the next cause of death, following cancer. It used to be tuberculosis, now it’s heart attacks, then cancer and they’re trying to tell us in cancer that very soon diabetes will be number three. This is hogwash. I took some of these patients that I was putting on thyroid therapy for high cholesterol and I followed them now for 30 years. The incidence of new cases of diabetes among those is very, very low, less than one-tenth the national average for diabetes. I think what happens to these people, and their symptoms of diabetes and of low thyroid are identical, everything except spilling sugar in the urine. The blood sugar isn’t elevated in a low thyroid. It is elevated and the sugar spills into the urine in the diabetic. So over this 30-year period the incidence of new cases of diabetes in those that are on thyroid, is very low. I think what is happening is that the repeated infections that all of us go through from childhood on, I think each one damages the pancreas some and eventually diabetes will develop. On the other hand, if we raise the resistance, with the thyroid, they don’t have so many infections and we don’t see the diabetes developing. The complications of diabetes I’ve been able to completely eliminate over the past 30 years with nothing but thyroid therapy. Ninety-eight percent of the diabetics are low in thyroid function. The others may be inherited or due to something else. That seems to be the case. I’ve been able to abolish the complications such as blindness. The leading cause of blindness today in America is diabetes. I’ve been able to eliminate cases of kidney failure, very detrimental to them, the gangrene where they have to cut off a toe and then the foot and then at the knee and then at the hip, then they go over the other side and start over. I haven’t seen one case of diabetes gangrene develop in thyroid-treated patients in the last 30 years. Well, we better save a few minutes here, because I’m going to get kicked off of this stool pretty quick, to say a few word about cancer. Cancer is number two at the present time. Cancer couldn’t be high before because of tuberculosis. Tuberculosis came much earlier than what cancer does. But we do have the number two killer today as cancer. Here, I think, again, is where we’re doing something with the thyroid and the repeated infections. In other words, one infection after another, each drags the individual down a little more, and I think that we finally get to the point where cancer may develop. This was worked out in Germany in the 1940s where they were studying tissue culture work. Take a few cells, could be out of the skin, out of the heart, out of any tissue in your body, put it in nutrient broth where it’s got food, put some oxygen in the area above it, it’s in a closed system, some heat to keep it at body temperature, and a shaking machine to agitate it. Those cells will grow and continue to grow. They’ll grow so much in fact that in not too long a time the few cells you put in there, not more than a dozen of them maybe, would in a comparatively short time would be larger than this desk I’m leaning on. They"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #9 8 found this, that if they cut down on the amount of oxygen above those tissues in the incubated material, if they cut it down more than 30 percent, they could develop cancer in any cell in the body, any type of cell. In other words, normal metabolism apparently prevented the development of many cancers. To bring that down to present point, during the last 30 years of all the deaths that have occurred in my patients, and some of them do die or the undertaker would shoot me, of all the deaths that have occurred, the incidence of cancer is less than one half what it is in the population as a whole. I think by increasing the amount of oxygen in the tissues of those patients we can prevent about 50 percent of the cancers today. I think that is the most fertile place for research in cancer prevention at the present time, to get these low body temperatures up with some thyroid therapy and avoid the development of many of the cancers. I have seen, as I say, only a few cancers here, but they’re markedly less than what we’d expect in the general population. I think my 40 minutes are about up. Norman, if there are any questions we’ll take a few minutes for questions. I can’t answer them all for you but we’ll make a stab at it. The question is, “How are we going to raise the thyroid?” Unfortunately, you have to have the doctor’s help. Like everything that’s new, it takes quite a while to get them used to it. You can change the thyroid by taking animal thyroid to supplant what you can’t use. You have to have a doctor’s prescription for it and there again is trouble because the doctors haven’t heard of what I’m talking about, 99 and 9/10 percent of them. They’ll have no stock in it because they weren’t taught that in school and some of them haven’t learned anything since they left school.  [Applause]  It ain’t funny, McGee. Most of them have forgotten considerably what they did learn. But we are getting some of them educated to where they understand the thyroid and are using it and there is hope on the horizon. California’s a favorite place. I think I’ve got more doctors in California following what I’m doing than any other state in the union. I’ve been spending most of my time in Colorado for the last 30 years. The information does grow. Now, you’ve got to use animal thyroid. Today you also have some synthetics available. Whatever nature does the chemist thinks he can do better. The synthetics are used and they will do some of the things that the thyroid will do, but they won’t do all of it. For years I’ve seen a parade of patients through my office that have been under treatment elsewhere and those that have been on the synthetics had two symptoms that were left. First of all they had that dry, rough skin. That is characteristic, usually, of a low thyroid. In second place, their tissues hold on to water. That again is a low thyroid. In 1896 the British told us in an"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #9 9 article that the thyroid is the best diuretic they’d ever seen. I have confirmed that. It’s just as true today as it was in 1896. If you can find two doctors in the state of California that haven’t heard me lecture I’ll buy you a drink if they know about it. So those two factors you won’t get in the synthetics and the natural thyroid will do it. It comes from animals. Most of it comes from pigs because they have a higher concentration then any other animals in their thyroid. After you take the tablets about three days you’ll go around, “Oink, oink, oink.” [Laughter] those that are allergic to pork can use beef. The beef preparations are also active but there isn’t quite as much hormone there as there is in the pork. Anybody else got a question that’s bothering them? [inaudible audience question] The question is, “Will a blood test pick up these problems?” It will pick up some of them. I was at this racket before the blood tests came along and the first one that came out the blood test didn’t fit the patient’s symptoms. I never used it and the other doctors swore by it. They swore by it and I swore at it for over 30 years. Finally we found out that is was useless and we couldn’t use it. Now we’ve got new ones coming out all the time, each one of which is more complicated and more expensive. But to date they haven’t had anything that a thermometer won’t tell you and it’s a whale of a lot cheaper.  [inaudible audience question]  The question is, “What temperature do you watch for?” If your temperature, under the conditions that I outlined, is below 97.8 degrees Fahrenheit, and you have symptoms of thyroid deficiency, the odds are about 90 out of 100 that you can tolerate the therapy. There’s a few people that can’t. You give them some thyroid and they’re immediately worse. These people are also low in adrenal function and if in that ten percent you’ll give them some adrenal with the thyroid, not only will they get rid of the symptoms they had that they thought was due to thyroid, but they’re liable to get rid of some others. The allergy people do beautifully on it because it’s one of the best treatments we have for allergy. You start your thyroid treatment with a small dosage, one grain a day, in a normal individual if you’ve got a good heart. If you’ve got a bad heart you’ve got to go slower. If you’ve had a heart attack you go a little slower yet. You never get more than about half the thyroid you really need because if the heart has been damaged it can’t respond. You’ll stay on that dose for a month. Then recheck your temperature. If your symptoms are all gone you stay on that dose the rest of your life. I’ve been on four grains for over 40 years and it hasn’t killed me yet, but I’m still working at it. If the temperature is still low, some symptoms persist, then you go up to two grains for a month. Up to three if need be, the same step technique. I"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #9 10 don’t go above four grains unless the guy is bigger than I am and can whip me. He needs more then so I’ll give him a little more, maybe, but those are rare. Any other questions? [inaudible audience question] The question is, “Does the hair analysis give you any information on the thyroid?” The answer is that it’s wasted money if it does because it isn’t going to pick most of them out in the first place and in the second place you’ve got to run the temperature anyway. So save the hair analysis. Some of it is for protecting the hair very much anyway. My head is going to soon resemble heaven because there’ll be no parting there. [inaudible audience question] No, iodine isn’t the answer because you can have plenty of iodine in your blood but that doesn’t necessarily give you a normal thyroid function. [inaudible audience question] You can’t improve on it. I’ve been using it now for over 40 years. It’s pork unless it’s specifically called for the beef. Audience: Where do you get it? Dr. Barnes: From a druggist. And you’ve got to have a prescription to get it. That’s the catch. You girls are mad about that, but you have to go see the doctor. It’s your fault that we have that law. When I started in the practice years ago you didn’t need a prescription for thyroid, you could buy it over the counter as you can down in Mexico. But some of the fat women were taking huge doses, trying to reduce, and they damaged their heart. So we had to have a law for it. I was afraid you’d be back, Norm. [inaudible audience question] What you see at the health food store is useless for what we’re talking about because if you look on the label carefully it’ll tell you that the thyroxin has been removed. It has to be or you couldn’t buy it without a prescription. Sorry to deflate you but those are facts. [inaudible audience question] "},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #9 11 “Do I recommend get exercise, get more air taken in to improve the thyroid?” The answer is no, it won’t improve that but it’ll sure make you tired and you’re tired to start with. [inaudible audience question] “What are the symptoms of adrenal shortage?” I can tell you that about 25 percent of those that are low in thyroid are low in adrenal too. Both of them receive their stimulus from the pituitary gland located up in your brain. If it’s low in one of them it’s likely to be low in the other. The most outstanding symptom and the one that’ll tip you off is these are the people with low blood pressure. The ordinary thyroid deficient will have a low blood pressure but it’ll come up on the thyroid. If it doesn’t come up, or he gets worse when you start the thyroid, you’ll find that your blood pressure has dropped and that is signal enough to add some Prednisone. I’ll use Prednisone, five milligrams a day. If you really want to stand your doctor on his ear, tell him that I’ve put you on some Prednisone. They’ve heard about the stories way back in 1949 when the Cortisone was first discovered at the Mayo Clinic. They found that it was very active. An arthritis patient, been in bed for two years and hadn’t been able to get out of bed, with the Prednisone, or Cortisone, they’re relatives, he not only got out of bed but he went back to work. [indecipherable] downhill pull, until the guy died within six months. When you look at the records you find out they were giving him 200 milligrams a day. That’s enough to kill a horse. And it’ll certainly kill a human. So it got a dirty name and the doctors are all scared to death and won’t use it. Yet five milligrams a day, if the body does need, they’re denied it because of disastrous results made in 1949. [inaudible audience question] That was done mechanically, just to see what would happen to tissue if they were oxygen-starved. [inaudible audience question] Increase their oxygen consumption it raises their metabolism. It gives them enough to get up and go, most of them to pay their income tax. [inaudible audience question] We’ll only need an hour to answer all of that. The question is, “Does low thyroid have anything to do with arthritis?” I have never seen an arthritic that wasn’t a low thyroid. If you get them early enough, before they get the deformed joints and whatnot, get them when it begins, we can handle it very well in the majority of cases, with nothing but the thyroid. Farther on you’re going to have to have some"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #9 12 Prednisone with it.

Norman: ...is the daughter of Charlotte Gerson and granddaughter of Dr. Gerson. She has been living in London for quite a number of years and has been quite active and talking over there and helping people with the Gerson Therapy in a variety of ways. Peggy Strauss.  [Applause]  Peggy: Well, it really is a pleasure to be here. It was something that I’ve been looking forward to for many, many months, to celebrating my grandfather’s centenary. I should say I’ve actually been looking forward to it for about two years, thinking about it. I’d like to talk to you a little bit today about the situation of the Gerson Therapy and natural therapies in general. In England I think it will be of great interest to you to hear what sort of things are being done over there and how we are taking this message also to the public in England. A few years ago in 1977 my mother came over to England to celebrate the first Festival for Mind and Body, which was really the coming-out of the Gerson Therapy in England, on a part of one of the members of the family. I will be mentioning, later, somebody who has been using the Gerson Therapy, or a version of the Gerson Therapy, over there from years before that. But this festival for Mind and Body was really the first time that somebody from the family got up and spoke in public about the Therapy. From there and the radio interviews that went along with it, we did generate quite a bit of interest for the book, for the therapy. I think things have been building gradually from then. In the fall of 1979 there was a third forum for new approaches to cancer organized in England by Health for the New Age. At that meeting a new organization was started, which was called the Association for New Approaches to Cancer. This association so far has had rather a wide range of interests in the nutritional and spiritual and psychological field where cancer is concerned. But of course one of"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #10 2 the therapies that is very much promoted by them and talked about them is the Gerson Therapy. We’re very pleased to have the director of the magazine of the association, Mr. Norman Eddy. Norman Eddy is the naturopath, I just mentioned before, who has been using the Gerson Therapy, or as I said, his modification of it, for about 10 to 12 years in Britain. This is the magazine that he publishes for the association. It’s called “Cancer Naturally.” In it there have been many articles about Dr. Gerson, by Dr. Gerson, explaining various aspects of the therapy. There was a piece by me about a visit that I made to the clinic in Mexico. We are happy to have Norman with us. He’s come all the way from England to attend this convention. Any of you who might want to speak to him about the situation in England, he is here and will identify himself later. There’s an interesting situation in England, which is somewhat brighter than here because we don’t seem to have the massive opposition and persecution by the medical profession that is so disturbing in this country. There’s a long history of herbal medicine in England. The Queen’s doctor is a homeopath. The whole royal family is treated by a homeopath. This is well known. Homeopaths are quite respected physicians in Britain. I believe it was Henry the VIII who had a great interest in herbalism and for that reason natural medicine and herbal remedies are quite respectable. I think we’ll find also with the Gerson Therapy that the terrain is less rocky than in this country. As a matter of fact, the father of a recovered patient, a recovered Gerson patient in Britain, wrote so insistently to his member of parliament that the member of parliament contacted the minister for health and I was summoned, myself, before the chief medical officer of the department of health and social services, which is the chief body that has to do with the national health service in England. I was summoned before this man to explain the Gerson Therapy to him. Now, such a meeting can be dangerous. It can have consequences that are negative for a therapy. But in this case, while he expressed interest and said that there was nothing much that he could do, there were no negative consequences that came out of the meeting. That was good. We didn’t feel that there was any organized opposition. That’s quite important. It was interesting, however, at the end of the meeting where I seemed to have met all his critical objections to the therapy and explained all the aspects that I could. I had gone to the meeting with the recovered patient, a bladder cancer patient who also was the secretary of the royal society of chemistry and had quite excellent credentials as a scientist himself. At the end of the meeting Dr. Righton, who is the chief medical officer, said that the practical problems of doing a therapy like this were enormous to implement. I said, “This should not be a consideration. We should look into a therapy and if it was scientifically valid and worked and we were satisfied that patients were being helped by this method and had had no other method that could explain their recovery, these practical problems should and must be overcome by the community as a whole.” He sort of chuckled cynically and said he used to"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #10 3 think like that when he was just out of medical school, but it just wasn’t so. I said to him on that point that he may as well write to all the cancer research foundations and tell them that they should stop looking for a cure for cancer because, after all, there was no sense in having idealism anymore. The Gerson Therapy does have many patients now in Britain who are doing well. It is more difficult to do the therapy there because outside of London it’s extremely hard to get organically grown food. England is a cold country. The weather is not very conducive in many part of the country, to growing food at all times of year. That is a big problem. We have organized a little network in London where organic food can be sent out to various parts of the country for a surprisingly small fee. People with a great deal of determination have been able to organize liver supplies for the liver juice. We’ve organized medication supplies and I think pretty much everything is now available to people in England who want to do the Gerson Therapy. Patients who’ve come all the way over from England to do the therapy in Mexico, have been able to continue their therapy in England with very good results. We are pleased at the kind of response that we’re having. In addition, a very good recent development, probably springing out of the new Association for New Approaches to Cancer, is that we’re getting some very interesting articles in the national press. England has a bit of a different situation with the newspapers than exists in this country. There are three or four important, serious, national newspapers. They really have the corner on the serious news stories. You’ll have many local papers and sort of tabloid papers, but the ones that are really looked to are these few newspapers. Recently a very long article came out in The Guardian, which is one of these national newspapers, by a man called Brian Ingles dealing with, attacking really, the orthodox approaches to the diseases of civilization, which is the title of his new book. The Gerson Therapy was mentioned very positively in this article. We also expect very soon a long piece in the Sunday Times, which is, of course, the most prestigious newspaper in Britain. Now this is quite an extraordinary thing. It would be as if the Sunday New York Times wrote a very big piece on the Gerson Therapy, independent of the kind of medical pressures that are put on journalists and newspapers in this country. I think that’s about all I have time to say about the situation in England. I would like to, if I may, if I have just a few more minutes, I would like to say that I’m also over here to bring to you and to launch this poem which my mother mentioned this morning and some of you have bought. I think you’ll really enjoy reading it. It’s a wonderful tribute to Dr. Gerson by an ex-patient who also happens to be a writer. In the tradition, which is an ancient and respected tradition of writing tributes in verse to great men, Dr. Juliana Diego of the University of London felt that it was time that literature opened its gates to new age ideas and"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #10 4 especially to the work of Dr. Gerson. This is the book, as we mentioned this morning. I’d like to just read you a couple of lines, a few lines from it if I may. You know that the coffee enema is a very crucial part of the Gerson Therapy and I think the very interesting invention was thought of by Dr. Diego concerning the medical bird, the ibis. I’d like to read you what he wrote about the ibis. “Even the ibis knows the formulation to make his feathers flaunt a healthy gleam. That bird has quite a medical vocation, endowed by nature with a perfect scheme for self-impelled colonic irrigation. He sucks the water from a sun-warmed stream, then as a hose his long, curved beak applies when tummy hardens or when bowel dries. The night is ending now in dew and vapor, and dawn has vanished too. It’s coffee time. My lap is covered by a heap of paper. It’s been so since I heard the midnight chime. I feel the draft that’s long put out my taper. It filters through the shutters while I rhyme. A healthy hour. I’ll walk down to the pier. My tribute to Max Gerson must end here. In Maple Grove a curving, shaded lawn contains among its hills his modest stone. A quiet corner near a fountain on the wooded path where mourners seek their own. Here hardy sparrows sing and winters dawn and never grass or shrub is overgrown. He broke no promise, served no private clan, he gave the title of an honest man.” Thank you veer much.  [Applause]  [audio cuts out] George: It’s an honor to be counted among the friends of these two people who work diligently, year in, year out, usually seven days a week, to help people against all odds, of the medical establishment, to bring about a natural way of healing and perhaps more important, to continue the work of Max Gerson whose birthday we celebrate today, to achieve eventually the prevention of disease. I consider Charlotte Gerson Strauss one of the great ladies in the world today. I welcome her once more to this podium.  [Applause]  Charlotte: Thank you so much, George. We appreciate you too. George is a kind of universal genius. He also has a medical background and training. He is a tremendous musician. He has written his own scripts for documentaries he’s done. He is a tremendous man. Now let us get down to our subject. The subject again seems to cover an awful lot of ground. Good health, from the moment of inception, conception, to old age. I’d like to spend only a little time on certain aspects."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #10 5 Obviously I can’t cover the whole subject. Dr. Livingston has done a good deal of my work already. She mentioned many things that are necessary to conceive and bear a healthy child. We have unfortunately so many young people now who have used drugs, pot and those things, which have already definitely shown their activities and propensity of causing birth defects. Now obviously this is not the way to start a new life. But that’s not the only thing. The mother’s body should be healthy. Here, aside from what Dr. Livingston already mentioned and I go along with all of these things, the mother’s body should be in good health and activity, cleansed of the toxic materials so that she does not have any problems in carrying the baby. There is a very interesting situation that occurs at times. I’d like you to think about this. It’s a very, very dangerous business. Every once in a while you hear people say, “I never felt real good. I’m hypoglycemic. But I felt marvelous while I was pregnant. As soon as the baby was born hypoglycemia game back.” What is really happening here is that the mother’s body is drawing on the baby’s forming pancreas and pancreatic juices and digestive systems to help her in her severe lack. She feels good. But what does that do to the baby. It’s drawing on a developing thing that should be given and not giving. This is a very dangerous business. If you have gone through an experience like that, give your child every advantage. Help in every way to build from this already damaged body, to build up a good, healthy liver and pancreas, or this child will have problems. Almost the same thing applies, and we have seen several examples of it in our own clinic. A lady who immediately after giving birth had very severe arthritis. How come she felt great while she was pregnant? Arthritis is a problem of protein digestion. I asked her, “Did you continue drinking milk after you had given milk?” She said, “Yes.” Her body was incapable of handling it so she became ill. With the child and the ability of the child’s pancreas to function partially for her, she felt good. But this is a dangerous way to go and of course damages the new baby. You don’t want to do that. The next thing you want to consider after birth, the richest and best and most wonderful source that nature and the good Lord have instituted for the baby to set up the baby’s entire digestive and immune system, is the very first milk that goes into the mother’s breast. It is not true milk. It is known as colostrum. It is a liquidy material. It’s only recently been seen and found and discovered how rich and wonderful a material it is. It has certain bacteria in it, as Dr. Livingston again mentioned, the bacteria in bifidus and others. These bacteria, including also certain friendly coli -- there are many different coli bacteria. There are certain friendly bacteria and important bacteria and organisms in this first material that goes into the mother’s breast, that helps to set up the entire immune system of this new little life. How many of you have heard doctors and these wise pediatricians say, “Don’t give the baby that first liquid? That’s not milk. Throw it"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #10 6 away.” They know better than nature, do they? What they do, of course, when they throw away this important material. The child is going to have colitis and colics. It’s going to have a poor immune system. It’s going to be sick. They are developing a good customer. I don’t think they know this. But that’s the way it works out. Dr. Mendelssohn mentions a good deal about that in his book. The best way for a pediatrician to work himself out of a practice is to insist that every mother nurse her baby. This is the natural and only proper food for a newborn child, mother’s milk. It is different from cow’s milk. A cow grows quickly. A baby grows slowly. A cow’s brain, do you want to raise a cow’s brain in your baby? It’s a different kind of brain. The baby needs different materials. The only proper and correct food is mother’s milk. Nature has such a wonderful way too. If a baby is not properly functioning or maybe has gotten a problem, maybe an injury or a cold or infection, which is rare to impossible if a baby is breastfed, but if it does happen, the mother’s body responds and generates the right materials to give the baby the immune activity and the healing materials it needs to fight that problem. Where can you do that with formula? Now comes the real problem, formula. It’s cooked to death. It’s dry. It’s dead. Enzymes are killed. It is cow’s milk, which is not right for the baby. So the doctor says, “Put some sugar and a little of this.” Now you have formula. Supposed to be right for your baby. Nothing is right for your baby except your breast milk. But that’s supposed to be the formula, with sugar in it. You begin to raise a sugar-addict right then and there. And the baby will have colics and problems and teething difficulties and runny noses and will have night fevers and stuff like that. Not so the breastfed baby. The next thing the baby will be getting canned, jarred baby foods and pablum with chemicals in it, preserved, dead, cooked to death. It won’t spoil because it’s dead. When you want to give your baby a jarred dessert, the pureed fruit desserts contain 18 to 21 percent sugar. When you want to really do something for that baby and give him something different, a little custard with milk and egg in it. No way. Some years ago Gerber’s custard was analyzed to have 42 percent sugar. More than candy! These new babies, the young babies that are now starting on canned, jarred baby foods, are poisons. They used to even put monosodium glutamate in these baby jars because in case the mother should taste it it shouldn’t taste flat. Monosodium glutamate causes brain damage. That’s all right. But when you figure the sugar content of the formula, the canned, jarred baby desserts, and now the sugar that’s in all the sweet drinks, the soft drinks, in the sweet cereals, the dry cereals children eat, in the candies and ice creams and cookies and sweet rolls. Are you surprised when you consider these and you read the statistics that there is an increase six percent of diabetes increase per anum in the United States? In other words, each year an addition of six percent diabetes from the year before. With all that sugar consumption, is that surprising? I believe the latest figures I’ve"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #10 7 seen is that sugar consumption on a per capita basis is something like 151 or 2 pounds per year per person. Now many of you here no about sugar. I don’t eat sugar. That means that the others eat that much more. The heaviest consumption of sugar is among children. That can’t be good. We know it isn’t. It’s not just diabetes. Diabetes is just a more or less direct result. What about the indirect results? What about the hypoglycemias? What about the cancer? You’ve heard Dr. Livingston talk about the total system has to be in balance. You’ve heard Dr. Sodi-Palleras talk about the total system has to be functioning and in order. All these things throw certain parts of the human system out and you get diseases. It doesn’t matter what you call them. Now you get these children having infections. Now they get colds and they get sniffy noses and they get fevers and they get flus and you name it. Now what happens? Many of you who were here yesterday saw Jim Clark. What happened to him? His mother, a nice lady, good nurse, she was a trained, registered nurse, to the doctor with a baby. Each time he had a cold or flu or fever or anything, a runny nose, off to the doctor. Antibiotics. Sulfur drugs. Antibiotics. Drugs. When he was 17 he lost his leg because he didn’t have an immune system going. You know how important that immune system is to fight other germs and bacteria and infections. Now comes another interesting thing. Many of you who were here this morning saw the two lovely young twins who had this rare disease in the aorta where the aortic arch thickened and fibrous so they had no more circulation to their arms, their kidneys, their head, their brain and so on. Do you know what happened to these kids? When they were two years old for reasons poorly understood by me, they were put for one whole year, by their doctor, on antibiotics. Chances are this doctor never knew, nor did the parents in the family know that these antibiotics damaging these young children’s developing bodies, would eventually cause this kind of problem, which is admissibly, malignant, deadly. They didn’t give these kids more than a year and a half to live. These are some of the problems we are facing. They develop one out of the other. When the immune system isn’t developed properly then come these infections and when the infections come then come the antibiotics. When the antibiotics come the new problems come. Drugs and drugs and damage and further damage. There is no way around it but the natural way. If the doctors and the authorities, as you heard from Peggy, they tell you it’s too difficult to implement... Wait a minute. What are we implementing? Constant treatment, constant disease, constant death. It’s the result of not implementing healing. It won’t work. Now come the young women and the young men and they’re heavy sugar consumers. You get everything from pimples and menstrual problems to"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #10 8 aggressiveness and anger in the young people. Now some of you may be familiar with the book written by Alexander Schauss. It’s called “Diet, Crime and Delinquency.” It very definitely shows through many work experiments as well as a tremendous bibliography, the work he has done among young criminals in jails in California as well as other states. Whereby studying their diets and seeing the tremendous levels of sugars these kids consume from their sugared cereals to the snack in mid-morning, the sweet rolls and the Coca Colas and the ice creams and the desserts and the lollipops and so on, huge amounts of sugar when they added it up in the course of a day. When these kids were talked to and learned about the influence of diet, they were all anxious to learn about it and change and try it. Low and behold they calmed down and quieted down. These were some of the most aggressive, angry, violent young criminals in their teens, under 20. Low and behold they calmed down and quieted down. When they were also given vitamin pills to supplement their rather poor food, they for the first time in their lives felt better. They were able to concentrate, read, study, learn, be productive, do things. And they wanted to. When Schauss tried to get the state to understand and change their diets they said, “If we change these people’s diets we’re going to have prison riots, food riots. We can’t change their diets. They’re getting the minimum daily requirements of everything they’re supposed to have. But what about all the sweets they can buy in their dispensaries?” The state wouldn’t do anything about it. But when the children, these youngsters and teenagers, finally did go home and had learned and applied what they learned about diet, the rate of crime in the return criminals dropped very sharply from something like 60 percent to something like two percent. So here is a solution, a simple solution to one of our most pressing social problems in the United States. Crime is related directly to diet. Instead they build more and bigger jails and better judicial systems. Again we are treating the symptoms, not the underlying cause. It doesn’t work. I’d like to also point out something else. The entire problem of drug addiction is essentially a deficiency disease. People who take a cup of coffee just to keep going, their bodies aren’t functioning. They need a lift. Coffee is a drug taken by mouth. People that take a smoke just to keep going, they need a lift. Their bodies aren’t functioning. It’s a heavy stimulant. But each stimulant is also depressant and when the stimulant activity wears out and the capillaries start to spasm and you feel low, that’s when you reach for the next cigarette. So it’s an addiction too. But it starts out by being a deficiency disease. The body is craving something, but the person doesn’t know what it is. They discover something or other they’ll take, whether it’s candy or a cigarette or a cup of coffee or alcohol. It’s going to depress their craving, temporarily drug it out of their system so they feel better, a little bit. But when it wears off then they go for the next one. So basically it’s a deficiency disease. We see it regularly in our clinics. The"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #10 9 patients come in still smoking on the drive up into the clinic. Of course, we have to make them get rid of their cigarettes. They can’t get well with smoking. They are surprised, they could never believe that they hardly have any withdrawal problems. Why don’t they? On the Gerson Therapy, getting a fresh glass of juice every hour, they get the nutrients the body is craving. They get the vitamins and minerals and enzymes, the nourishment the body really wants, and the craving for cigarettes is gone, or for alcohol or coffee or whatever it may be. Some of the severe drug addictions like morphine, codeine, valium, they have very severe after effects. But getting them off these drugs, including of course, street drugs, is relatively simple because it’s nothing but deficiency disease. If you simply give these people the proper nourishment deficiency disease disappears and there’s no more craving and their problems go away at the same time. What about the problem of children, so-called hyperactive children? It’s already well known that all you have to do is get these kids off food additives, chemicals, poisons. In some cases, get them off the TV set. Radiation, poisoning, damaging radiation. But in most cases getting them off the food additives will do. Now you heard several other speakers, including myself, talk about the some 10,000 food additives that are in our processed foods, accepted as safe by the Food and Drug Administration. None of them are safe. There is no safe chemical drug that you can put into the body. “Oh, but in small quantities.” What do you mean? Everyday? Everyday small quantities? It adds up. It’s easily demonstrable that you can get these children on organic foods and eliminate the hyperactivity. Instead what is being done? They are drugged. They are being given drugs. And given drugs long enough they either get brain damage, or if they drugging continues, eventually liver damage and cancer. These are the results of food additives, chemical-izing drugs. Treating symptoms. We don’t want to do that. The human body is so constitute that it requires the fresh, live foods, the foods as they grow - high in potassium, low in sodium. You’ve heard the other speakers say the same. Potassium has to be in the cells, sodium has to be in the fluid. If any of these things are disturbed, changed, upset, the body doesn’t function the way it’s supposed to. Whether you now call it heart failure or cancer or psoriasis or glaucoma or kidney disease or anything else, doesn’t really matter. Call it hypertension or hyperactivity. There is some disturbance in this very delightfully delicate biological system, tremendously interrelated with checks and balances, delicately balanced that we bring out of balance with drugs and chemicals and dyes and emulsifiers with symptomatic treatments that the doctors call, what do they call it? Handling, managing, supporting. I have an article among my very lovely collection, where doctors writing about curing said, “We don’t really like to talk about cure because it is the accepted role of the medical profession to provide comfort because there are so few remedies.” Is that what you go to your doctor for, for comfort? Or would you like to get well? They say, “We can’t get you well. There are no real remedies. All we can do is comfort you,” meaning"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #10 10 suppressing pain and symptoms. Even that they often can’t do. They cause new pain and symptoms with their aggressive medicine. Now we are past the young children and the teenagers with their problems. Now we get into the problem of the young adults and the smokers and the drinkers, the deficiency addictions. It doesn’t take very much longer that now we get serious diseases. We already have seen the diabetic, who by the time they are 25 or 30 are blind and on a kidney machine. That’s a wonderful life. Then we see the young women who are given the birth control pill for their problems. Many of you heard lovely Yvonne sing with her beautiful voice yesterday that shook us all and moved us all. When she was 13 she was given drugs for her pimples and her acne. What was she given? The birth control pill. The next thing she had allergies and she developed asthma. Then she developed cancer after that. One thing after another. More drugs. Heavier, harder, more aggressive medication. Everything leading to worse problems. That’s not the way to treat the human body. Now we get into our early 30s and middle and late 30s and we see the MS and we see the people with lupus. Now the doctors say, “There’s really nothing we can do. Prednisone. We must suppress the symptoms.” Then you see the moon faces and the pimples. You see the people getting fat. Their liver, their pancreas, their adrenals, their thyroid, their pituitary, everything gets out of function. And the disease doesn’t go away. Then you get the young people already in their late 30s with heart attacks. They are very severe at these young ages. They’re dying already. It was a very sad statistic to see already years ago, during the Korean War, the young soldiers under 28, many of whom are tragically killed. They did autopsies on them. Many of them had arteriosclerosis, severe arteriosclerosis, they could have led to heart attacks within a very short time. In their middle to late 20s. Drinking, smoking, Coca Cola, sugars, terrible diets, white flours. That’s not the way the human body is supposed to function. Another thing you want to remember is, if you give your body empty calories that have no enzymes, vitamins and minerals in them, like the white sugar, the white flour, the fats, the lards, Crisco, the hydrogenated fats, not only do you not give your body anything, empty calories is a misnomer. Because when you force something into your body, force your body to handle empty calories, the body has to use its own reserves of enzymes and vitamins and minerals to even break down and digest these materials, to metabolize and utilize and excrete these materials. The body needs to use its own fuels and accumulations. You haven’t given it anything. You’re taking away. You’re not just running on empty, you’re taking away with empty calories. Your body is supposed to get fuel and nourishment out of your food. It requires the minerals, the potassium and the other minerals, trace minerals as well as the calcium and magnesium and manganese, in its natural form, in the organic form. The plants take the minerals out of the soil and change them into organic compounds that your body can utilize. "},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #10 11 You already heard this morning, again too, or yesterday, whenever it was, that giving, for instance, iron pills, doesn’t do anything to raise the iron content of the blood. You have to let the body function right and detoxify and give it the organic material so that it can pick it up and metabolize it properly and utilize it. You can’t give these artificial materials. When you eat every bit of food you put into your body has to nourish you in every way, not only calories but the minerals, the vitamins, the enzymes and the nutrients in every way that your body requires to function. Then it will function. If you don’t do that, now you get the degenerative diseases of middle age. In your mid-40s already we get the cancers. It doesn’t even take that much. One of the most frightening things now is this, I’ll give you an example. We had a lady who came to the clinic, her knee swollen like that with rheumatoid arthritis. She was 55 and she couldn’t walk. She came with her daughter, just to help her. Her daughter was 26. She already had rheumatoid arthritis and the daughter, 26, had a little girl at home, five years old, who already had rheumatoid arthritis. That’s scary. Each new generation being damaged more and more develops these problems at a younger age. That’s frightening. And they get drugs at a younger and younger age. And they get sicker earlier. So what do we do? Prevention starts in the soil. The soil has to be sound. If you want sound, healthy plants, you’ve got to have a sound soil. If you want your plants to pick up zinc and calcium and magnesium and all the minerals you need, and all the proteins that you need, it’s got to be rich in those materials first of all. It’s got to have it to give it. So the soil has to be restored to health. Dr. Gerson called the soil our external metabolism. The materials from the body must go back into the soil and the soil will recreate them into edibles and they have to go back. It is an eternal cycle and if we break it, we break our health. That’s the whole life cycle, beginning with health, beginning with a healthy soil, beginning with a healthy set of parents, with a healthy baby at birth, well- nourished the way the good Lord intended it to be nourished, for healthy life and living, into old age. I’d like to restate to some of you who were not here yesterday and this morning, that a number of the patients and the people I presented here, at least four of them were over 80 and in good health over 80, in good activity, several of them working and active. Most of them traveling and getting around, doing things, enjoying life, free of problems. Healthy old age, productive and happy, so that you’re not a burden to yourself and others. Health is such a treasure that we simply must not treat it lightly. People tell me, “You mean you really don’t eat meat? What is there?” No, I don’t eat meat. Do I look weak, tired, weary? We had a tremendous work output here in the last couple of months. Do I look tired? I do get tired, but I sleep and I am refreshed. I don’t eat meat.

Norman: ...unusual person in that I have not met anybody who has been dealing with the lymphatic system to the extent that this expert has. I’d like to ask a question because it’s such a common error that people have in their thinking. I didn’t know it until a couple of years ago myself. Most people think that the blood carries nutrients to the cell and that the blood takes waste materials away from the cell. I won’t take the time for a show of hands, but did you know that those are erroneous statements? The lymphatic system does this. The blood carries it part of the way, both going and coming, but not the last leg of the journey going and not the beginning. In fact the first few feet, in many instances of the waste material path from the cells, is not by the bloodstream. Anyway, Dr. Sam West, our next speaker, is going to be talking on the lymphatic system, disease and healing. He has been able to show and demonstrate many times, to many audiences, that disease can be caused by trapped natural blood proteins. Dr. West has recently gone to the Eighth International Congress of Lymphology in Montreal, Canada. He has a certificate that says, “Dr. C. Samuel West has presented a paper entitled ‘The Basic Formula Showing How the Plasma Proteins Produce the Conditions that Cause Loss of Energy, Disease and Death at the Cell Level’ at the Eighth International Congress of Lymphology.” It’s signed by the president of three different scientific groups. Dr. Sam West.  [Applause]  Dr. West: Let me put this formula on the board. I’m going to be talking about it. It’s the formula that Norman Fritz just talked about that I presented to Congress, which gives the cause of every crippling and killer disease known to man. From this formula we can now write the cause of heart disease, cancer, obesity, stroke, high blood pressure, MS, polio, arthritis, all of the crippling, killer diseases, and what we must do to prevent it and reverse it. We’ll go over this formula. [audio cuts out]"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #11 2 I left Cleveland this morning at 5:45 and said, “The plane is going to be late.” I just came through the door a minute ago so I’ve been traveling all day long to get here. But it’s a privilege to be here today, to be asked to speak at this fantastic conference with the Gerson Institute. I have profound admiration for the Gerson Institute and the things that they’re doing because the things that they’re talking about are right, especially Dr. Gerson’s concepts when he talks about the mineral balance within the cell, that inside the cell the potassium has to be high and the sodium has to be low. The potassium has to be high inside the cell and the sodium has to be low. They’ve known this for years. They’ve known that anything that will upset the delicate sodium/potassium balance in that cell will damage or kill the cell. The cell has in it a sodium/potassium pump. The purpose of the sodium/potassium pump is to get calcium, iron, glucose and other minerals into the cell so the life process of the cell can function. Now the sodium/potassium pump, if you upset the sodium/potassium balance in the cell then the pump shuts off. They’ve known for years that excess sodium outside the cell will upset that delicate sodium/potassium balance and the pump does shut off. You can’t get nutrients inside the cell. So no matter what you might have in the bloodstream, to get to the cell, if the sodium/potassium pump isn’t working, if the life processes are down, you can’t the minerals and nutrients into the cell. So they’ve known that a chemical imbalance within the cell will damage or kill the cell. Another thing they have known that will damage or kill the cell is lack of oxygen. Glucose is the fuel for the cell. Glucose plus oxygen goes to adenosine triphosphate which is the ATP inside the cell. It’s the ATP that keeps that sodium/potassium pump going. That’s what keeps the life processes going. That pump actually turns in to an electrical field. That’s what the double E stands for at the end. The bottom formula we’re going no TTP, no excess fluid, no excess sodium. Double E means the electric generators run at the cell level and you have a healthy cell. Now the top formula goes into the cause of every killer disease known to man. Then we have to learn what we have to do to get the cell balanced at the cell level, what we have to do to reverse the condition because if there’s healing to take place, if the cell gets help at all, if it happens, it has to happen at the cell level. You have to increase the life process of that cell. You’ve got to get the minerals and nutrients into that cell if you’re going to heal the cell or help the body. I have been doing, in the last seven years, back in 1974 during the seventh year of teaching chemistry, I came across some research concerning the blood protein. These are the proteins that make up the bloodstream, the albumin, the globulin and the fibrinogen. These blood proteins are found to cause death within just a"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #11 3 few hours within the body. The research didn’t say why or how. So for the last seven years I’ve been trying to find out why and how. We’ve come up with seven major discoveries dealing with life and death at the cell level. From these seven discoveries I wrote the formula that you see on the board. The formula is actually step 31, as I have to present the formula like I did I Canada before the lymphologists there. I started with the healthy cell and then I went down what would damage or kill the cell. Step 31 is the top formula. The seven golden discoveries in this formula is being published in a book called “The Golden Seven Plus One,” which will be out at about Christmastime. “The Golden Seven Plus One.” If any of you may want to order that book, because I’ll be under pressure at the end, let me tell you the address to send for it if you want it. It’s PO Box 351 in Orem, Utah. A 20 dollar donation will give you the book and the book comes to you as a gift when it comes off the press. It’s actually a donation for the book. That’s how we have it set up. This is a nonprofit foundation. In this book the blood proteins, in finding out how the blood proteins cause death let us think about shock because every law we break mentally, nutritionally or physically, will take the blood proteins out of our bloodstream and put them around the cells. When they go around the cells we get excess fluid and excess sodium. Excess FL there stand for excess fluid. When we have excess fluid it causes lack of oxygen at the cell level. This is the blocked circulation they’ve been talking about. They’ve known that the cause of disease was blocked circulation at the cell level. Glucose is a fuel for the cell. Glucose plus oxygen goes to ATP. Without oxygen you can’t have the adenosine triphosphate and the live processes shut off. Now let’s talk about shock. We know the shock can cause death in just a few hours. How does it happen? In the body we have the veins and the arteries and the capillaries. The blood capillaries permeate every solid structure of our body, bones, eyes, organs and everything. It’s from the blood capillaries that the fluid comes out to irrigate the cells with oxygen and nutrients. Here is where life and death takes place. If we think of a smashed finger it’ll help us understand shock. Once we get shock down then everything else falls into place. When you damage a cell, when you damage a finger, the finger swells up. This is why it swells. When you damage a cell it puts off poison, histamine and bradykinin. These poisons attack the blood capillaries and open them out. It lets the blood proteins come into the spaces around the cells and the water follows it. The purpose of the blood proteins is to keep the water in the bloodstream, the albumin, the globulin, the fibrinogen. The blood is 91 percent water. So the blood proteins are to keep the water in the bloodstream so the blood can bring oxygen and nutrients to the cell. It’s ironic that the same substance that is necessary to keep the water in the bloodstream, to bring oxygen and nutrients to the cells, when it gets trapped around the cells, then the water follows it and it floods the cells with water and the cells drown from lack of oxygen. It’s exhibited when you smash your finger."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #11 4 You damage a cell, the cell puts off poison. Poisons attack the blood capillaries and [indecipherable] open up those pores and let the blood proteins out and the water follows it and the finger swells up. Let me ask you a questions. What would happen if something would dilate your blood capillaries throughout your entire body, let the blood proteins out of the bloodstream and the water would follow it? It would collapse the circulatory system, right? Do you follow me on that? Well this is death due to shock. This is why people turn white. When it happens they actually lose their blood. It goes right out into the tissue spaces and they turn white. They say that cayenne pepper may help that. The reason why is cayenne pepper is high in potassium. It’s remarkable when you get trapped protein, excess fluid, excess sodium and you reduce the energy field in the cell and you damage and kill the cell, that’s what this square with the X is, it’s the damaged or dead cell. Double E, you reduce the live process of the energy field that’s in the cell. When you have five things equaling each other, the power of the formula is that you alter any one of those and you alter the whole thing. You can’t alter part of it without altering all of it. So when you put cayenne pepper, which is high in potassium or capsicum, you put the potassium in, you get the excess sodium out. You reestablish the sodium/potassium balance within the cell. The sodium/potassium pump takes off, which generates an electrical field and now we know as lymphologists, the electricity dissipates blood proteins so the generators turn on, the excess protein comes out, the excess fluid comes out and this is where you can save yourself and help yourself in case of a shock situation. We know that aloe vera is good for burns and it heals burns and speeds the healing process. Why? Again, it’s high in potassium. If it’s high in potassium you get the excess sodium out and the same thing happens. You reestablish the chemical balance, the live process takes off, it’s electrical, it dissipates the excess proteins, the excess fluid comes out and the oxygenated blood comes in and takes the pain away. Un-oxygenated blood cannot relieve pain. If we have time I’ll get into pain and teach what we have to do to relieve pain and reverse injury. This we have learned. Now back into the shock problem. The shock dilates the blood capillaries and brings the water out of the bloodstream and you’re dead in just a few hours. Let me ask you a question. Does stress drain energy out of your body? According to the formula trapped protein, excess fluid, excess sodium reduces the energy field. In order to reduce the energy fields it has to cause trapped protein. This is the truth. According to the second formula no trapped protein around the cells, no excess fluid, no excess sodium, the live processes are on and theoretically the cells could live forever. They would not die. Theoretically they’d live forever. But every law we break, mentally, nutritionally and physically, will trap proteins."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #11 5 Now some of you may believe that maybe man was created on this earth at one time in a condition where he would not die. Then he broke a law and he came out of that garden with blood in his veins. Then it says he’s going to die. We’ve never known what it was in the bloodstream that would cause death until now. It is the blood proteins. If you could keep the blood proteins in the bloodstream it would be impossible to have any crippling or killer disease. You couldn’t have viral infections, bacterial infections, allergies, parasites, anything. All of the crippling, killer disease is caused by the blood proteins. As I stated in the introduction, I presented this formula to the top scientists in the world. I met them for the first time in 1979 in Italy. There was only 300 men in the entire world doing research on this subject. Now there’s about 400. In Italy I was admitted as the 379 th member of International Society of Lymphology. These are the top surgeons and doctors in the world on this subject. I went back and presented the formula that we’re giving you here today. The blood proteins, as in stress, stress brings the blood proteins out, shock makes you thirsty. Well if you put a person under stress it makes you thirsty too, right? If you put a person under stress long enough could you kill him? Yes or no? This is why, the proteins come out, it reduces those energy fields. Let me ask you a question. When your children argue in your home, does it drain energy out of your body? That loss of energy is a symptom of death. If it would continue it would cause your death. Loss of energy is a symptom of death, sudden loss of energy. It’s a mild form of shock. Stress is a mild form of shock. When you argue and have fights and quarrels and these things going on, the mental attitudes, the negative emotions, they are mild forms of shock. Anything that drains energy out of your body, you know you’re causing trapped blood proteins around those cells and you’re causing your destruction. Now if stress can trap the blood proteins, we know it does, now we know why it’s related to the crippling killer diseases. Let me bring this over here so I can talk and do this at the same time. Let me explain the formula for obesity. I’ll go through the formula now for your killer diseases [indecipherable]. Trapped proteins, excess fluid is the formula for obesity. Those medical charts show they retain fluids in your body 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 gallons at a time. Have you tried putting two 10-gallon cans inside your body? That is the formula for obesity. We now believe that some people are born with a loose cellular structure. Can you blow up some balloons easier than you can others? We believe now that some people’s bodies are the same. A person with a loose cellular structure goes into obesity. A person with a tight cellular structure will go into high blood pressure very quickly. Here’s the formula for high blood pressure. It’s the same thing - trapped protein, excess fluid. You have hypertension. As lymphologists we’ve known this for a long time. The cause of hypertension is the blood proteins. The blood"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #11 6 proteins cause fluid retention and causes pressure in the blood stream. You get the blood proteins outside the bloodstream and cause the fluid retention out there and it will cause pressure in the blood stream. I wish I could have my entire chart on the board so I could give you a more graphical demonstration. We have the blood capillaries and the cells and the lymphatics out there. When those blood proteins get out there it causes fluid retention and it goes right into hypertension. Hypertension is what gets the little guy. This is where he gets it, the silent killer. You can’t see it. It happened before it’s even visible. Congestive heart failure is nothing but fluid retention due to trapped blood proteins. There are 24 million people with high blood pressure, another 24 have it and don’t know it. It’s part of killing a million people a year from heart disease. So we have obesity and high blood pressure. We go into trapped protein and excess fluid and it’s going to cause lack of oxygen and lack of oxygen is pain. They’ve known for years that un-oxygenated blood cannot relieve pain. Electricity dissipates the blood proteins. This is how come they’ve got pain clinics in the United States. They’re putting electrical devices on or near the body and they’re able to relieve pain. Dr. Joseph Walsh in New York is putting electrodes down the spine and he’s taking previously helpless cerebral palsy and MS and polio patients right out of wheelchairs. I’ll explain that in a minute. As soon as we get to that disease we’ll show you how it works. Electricity dissipates the blood proteins. No trapped protein, no excess fluid, no excess sodium, the life processes are on and you’re healthy. It’s impossible to have a disease in this condition. You can’t have pain, you can’t have obesity, you can’t have high blood pressure, nothing. If you have trapped protein, excess fluid, you have obesity, you go into high blood pressure, you have heart disease. You go into lack of oxygen and lack of oxygen is cancer. I’m sure you may have heard this in this convatory, but Dr. Otto Warburg at the Max Planck Institute of Nutrition and Research in Germany, he’s a Nobel Prize winner, they’ve taken perfectly healthy cells and they have withdrawn the oxygen from those cells. They turn cancerous every single time. The body makes cancer cells all the time. We have seen pictures of the lymphocytes actually destroying the cancer cell. They can eat it up. But for the lymphocyte to work, it too is a cell, and that cell has to have oxygen. Without oxygen this cell has the same thing happen to it. The immune system cannot work in lack of oxygen. So when you get the fluid retention in there to a degree that the cancer cells take off, when that happens, when it’s in there at that degree, the white blood cells cannot destroy the cancer cell. In order to destroy the cancer cell you’ve got to get the excess fluid out of there. You’ve got to get the oxygen so the white blood cell can work. This is how they fight cancer. To do that, we’ve learn what causes the trapped proteins, and we’ll get to that in just a minute. That’s the cause of disease and then to reverse that is how to prevent it."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #11 7 We’re going into the various diseases. Cancer, heart disease, obesity, high blood pressure. When you come off the other end over here they have proven that muscles work electrically. A doctor in Chicago developed a thought-activated artificial limb. He wires it up and he said, “Next time you’re down in Chicago come on down. I’ll wire you up with this arm on you. You just think about it. It allows amputees to shake hands, hold a cup and wave merely by thinking of the motion.” They’ve been able to take, in the University of Pacific in Stockton, California, they developed a device where they can activate typewriters using electrical activity in the forehead muscles. They wire them up and you think about it and the typewriter takes off. Why do you think they made the Six Million Dollar Man? They made him because they knew the body works electrically. Even the thought waves are electrical. In ‘74 I came across the blood protein research. In ‘76 I saw some new scientific films. These films showed a person with electrodes going from his brain to electric trains and they can magnify his thought waves and he can stop and start the train just by thinking about it. Let me ask you a question. If somebody’s mad at you, do they have to tell you or can you feel it? The thought wave is electrical. Energy coming from the eyes is electrical. They had a guy paralyzed from the neck down. He could press this little button and make his wheelchair go but he couldn’t turn it. They wired him up with a shield here and a shield here. He pressed his button, his wheelchair takes off. He looks at this shield, it turns the wheelchair to the right. He looks at this and it turns it to the left. But the electrical energy from his eyes turns that wheelchair. Anybody that’s fallen in love knows the eyes are electrical, true or false? When you stop to think of these things you think of the atom. The atom is electrical. It has electrons, protons and neutrons. The atom is electrical and we’re made up out of atoms. How in this world can you take something that’s electrical and make something out of it without the total system working electrically? You can’t. The human body is an electrical being. Our health, strength and endurance depends upon the energy currents which run through the body. Now when you stop to think of these things, just ponder a minute. Even the thought waves. If the thought wave is electrical, we’ve got constant electricity coming out of our bodies and our thought waves. You can’t get something from nothing. If we’ve got constant electricity coming out, there’s got to be electric generators inside somewhere, producing electricity. Where are the generators? In the cell. The sodium/potassium pump that brings minerals and nutrients inside that cell, that rotation of minerals creates an electrical field. Live processes have been found to generate the electrical fields in every organism that’s been examined. It takes a delicately balanced distribution of minerals in and around that cell that accounts for its electrical field in a plant or animal. It is the same. Every cell is an electrical generator. Without oxygen -- glucose plus oxygen equals ATP. It’s the ATP that"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #11 8 keeps those electrical generators going. So without oxygen the generators shut off. We say we’d die without oxygen. We’d die at the cell level. Without oxygen the generators shut off and we die. We upset the chemical balance of the cell. Excess sodium upsets that chemical balance and the generators shut off. The body is electrical. If muscles work electrically and everything, then we can see the formula. It makes it clear now. Trapped protein. Let’s take arthritis and go from there. Trapped protein, excess fluid, excess sodium reduces the energy field. That pump makes glucose, calcium, iron and so forth in that cell. When that pump shuts off, you get trapped protein, excess fluid, lack of oxygen, excess sodium, the pump shuts off and the calcium drops out of solution. That is the cause of arthritis and hardening of the arteries, which is, again, killing about a million people a year. That’s been proven by Dr. Campbell, who’s an osteopath. He’s written a book called “The Proven New Home Cure for Arthritic Pain.” He says, “I don’t care what kind of arthritis you have. I don’t care if you’re in the bed, out of the bed. Expect a miracle.” All he does is take people off the foods that trap all those proteins. We’ll come to that in just a minute. He takes people off the foods that trap those blood proteins. The trapped protein comes out, the excess fluid comes out. The excess fluid comes out, the excess sodium comes out, the generators turn on and the calcium comes right back into solution and the joints go perfect. I have seen that happen, literally, where there’s arthritis. Off this end you’ve got obesity, high blood pressure, pain, cancer, heart disease. Up this end you’ve got arthritis. So when the generators shut off you go to polio and the other crippling spastic diseases. The muscles can’t work. Here’s how Dr. Joseph Walsh at the St. Barnabus Hospital in New York, he is now taking previously helpless cerebral palsy and MS and polio patients and bringing them right up out of wheelchairs. An 18 year old girl confined to a wheelchair was able to walk unassisted and feed herself after that [indecipherable]. How does it work? Because the electricity dissipates the blood proteins. Got this from Dr. Frederick Plogue [?]. I found a study of his in Germany. He discovered the laser acupuncture machine. He was explaining how he could extract a tooth without pain, take pain out of accidents in about 60 seconds, make incisions in the body without pain. I said, “Dr. Plogue, aren’t you just moving out the blood proteins?” “Oh,” he said, “we’ve known about the blood proteins for a long time in Germany. They discovered in Germany when the energy field is down, then the blood proteins stick together, they cluster. The blood proteins stick together out there in those tissue spaces. When they stick together then the water comes out and swells that finger up, or wherever it happens the blood proteins stick together. Then the lymphatics can’t pull them out. That research says if the lymphatics can’t pull them out, death takes place within that area and it begins to die. Now it’s very clear. Electricity dissipates the blood proteins so"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #11 9 when you put the electricity in the trapped protein comes out, the excess fluid comes out and they’re coming up right out of wheelchairs. Now I have seen that happen. We have now devised ways, and it’s in the book, we had a women who had polio, just ten months old, she was 65. In four months time she reversed her crippling disease. Her heel was on the floor. She was standing three inches off the floor, her heel was on the floor, standing three inches taller, the pain out of her back, moving the tolls, the generators were going on and the feeling was coming back in the paralyzed legs. I had one with arthritis, ten years on crutches, her legs were frozen solid. She couldn’t stand or sit. They had to help her do both. They were frozen from calcium deposits. Well I found the pain isn’t in the bones, it’s in the cells around those bones. You don’t know if it’s calcified or not until you get the blood proteins out of there because within one hour’s time, and all these things are in the book. We don’t have time to go into how to do it and everything. But within an hour’s time we got the blood proteins out of her legs and within half an hour the legs were down. She was crossing her legs, shouting with joy. Within the next half hour she got up and walked without crutches, without pain, right underneath my eyes. Now I’ll go into this technique with you because it was confirmed by Dr. Waldemar Lech Olszewski from Poland at the Congress of Lymphology in Canada. The technique was confirmed on how it works. The blood proteins are removed by the lymphatic system. Dr. Olszewski was presenting some films and his papers and he was showing how he massaged the foot and he did certain things and they were photographing it like it’s never been done before. He has a new technique of doing it. I went up and I said, “Dr. Oshalski, how did you massage the foot?” He said, “I didn’t.” I said, “What did you do?” He said, “I did this.” All he did was rub it. I said, “That moved out blood proteins?” He said, “It did.” “That moves lymph?” “It sure does.” I said, “You just confirmed one of the major self-help pain-relief techniques we’ve been using for years to relieve pain.” When you hurt yourself, don’t you grab and rub? Do you? Well, we stop and look. That’s a mistake. If you keep the blood proteins out, when you smash your finger, what’s your first impulse besides scream? You grab it. We’re so dumb we turn it to look and see what we did. Once you turn loose the poisons attack the capillaries, the proteins, the fluid retention, lack of oxygen and pain. Then it hurts so much all you do is shake it a second and put it on ice. Right? Next time you smash your finger -- like my boy did, he gashed it open with a can and ripped it down to the fingernail with a knife. Next time you smash you finger, grab a hold of your finger. I’m going to show you something. Grab hold. You just injured your finger. I’m going to teach you how you can heal that finger and you’ll get the pain out in a maximum of 20 minutes. When that happens you grab hold and you don’t turn loose. It’s when you grab hold, the same things are happening. The poisons are attacking the blood capillaries, the proteins are trying to get out there."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #11 10 But if you hold on they can’t get out. The blood proteins come out under the pressure in the bloodstream. If you apply pressure outside you equalize that pressure and the blood proteins can’t get out there. According to the formula. No trapped protein, no excess fluid, no excess sodium. The generators are on and you’ve got healthy cells. Now the secret is how log you hold on. You hold on till the pain goes away. What do you got to lose? It feels better here than anywhere else, true or false? A maximum of 20 minutes. Maximum. It was confirmed in Italy. Within 20 minutes the poisons stop attacking the blood capillaries. The capillaries tighten up and the proteins get out there. Most of the time within five. When the pain comes out you can turn loose. You turn loose there is no excess fluid, no excess sodium. The pain is gone and it does not come back and the generators are on, the live processes are taking place and that finger heals so fast that nine times out of ten you don’t lose your fingernail and it doesn’t even turn black and blue. I was in the airport the other day. My luggage fell over on my hand. I was black and blue. They had to pull it off of me. I was in pain. Everything caught me right there in the hand. Where it is I held on tight. In five minutes the pain was gone. Then I tried that light, fast stroke, the bioelectric light, fast stroke. Everybody say that. The bioelectric light, fast stroke. As I did the black and blue started to disappear. That moves lymphatic. You move lymphatic the blood proteins come out. As the limousine driver saw the black and blue disappear he said, “I don’t belie that.” I said, “Neither do I.” We kept going and in 20 minutes time I completely reversed the injury. Not a sign of a black and blue. Nothing. The hand was normal. I got home and my 11 year old boy came running out with black and blue marks across his back, bleeding. Within three minutes time we had the pain out of his back. What happened was his older brother hit him across the back with a plastic bat. He was bruised and bleeding. In the three minutes time we had the pain out of his back. Within 20 minutes we almost completely reversed that injury. Most of the black and blue was gone. As it went away his younger brother, Benjamin, said, “It’s going away, Steve. It’s going away.” We had almost all of it out. Within three minutes time the pain was gone. So there is a way to relieve pain. We can go into that some more. If some of you want to come and talk to me about that we can go into more of that. It’s in the book in detail. All of these pain- relief techniques. How we have smashed fingers, caught in the door, bleeding at the knuckles. Within three minutes the pain was gone and it was gone. It never came back. We had a young boy with a steel bar down his back, with scoliosis of the spine. He couldn’t stand and he couldn’t sit with pain. Within one week’s time the pain was gone. I called him four years later, the bar is still there and the pain is gone. [indecipherable] couldn’t walk two and a half years with lower back problems, lower back and sciatic nerve problems. Within 48 hours of learning about that formula he was out of pain. They wouldn’t operate on him. He was in constant"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #11 11 pain and the doctors said if they operated on him they’d leave him an invalid. He learned how to get the blood proteins out and the excess fluid out. In 48 hours he was out of pain, working eight hours on his farm. He ran for Mayor of Pleasantville, Utah and he made it and blames it on me. A woman fell on the ice and hurt her hip, like a smashed finger. The chiropractors have known for years the muscles pull the bones out of place. As a naturopath, which is my first doctor degree, was working with muscles, the same as chiropractic, only we worked with muscles. We knew the muscles pulled the bones out of place. Now we know it’s the blood proteins causing fluid retention in that muscle that pulls the muscle out of place. It pulls the muscles tight and blocks the circulation, goes up the head and down the neck. That’s what causes migraine headaches and sore neck problems. You get the blood proteins out. It’s all in the book, teaches you how to get the blood proteins out of there, you get it to here and you will heal that neck within a week’s time. You’ll have it under control. We’ve had hundreds and hundreds of cases said they were born with these problems, lower back pains and pain in the shoulders and neck and everywhere else. They get the blood proteins out and it’ll heal. That’s the secret to the process. Before I get off the pain subject, my grandmother had arthritis and have you seen people stroke their legs until it feels better and then wait till the pain comes back? The stroke it till it feels better and then wait till the pain comes back. Have you seen them do that? Let me ask you a question. If pain is lack of oxygen, when you stroke it and it feels better, are you getting oxygen to the cells? Yes or no? If you’re getting oxygen to the cells then you’re converting glucose to oxygen and the generators are turning on. The secret to the healing process is this. If you want to heal it, like putting electrodes down the spine, like they do at the hospital, and keep the trapped proteins out and keep those generators on and bring people out of wheelchairs, if you want to heal it, if you want to keep those generators on, you have to work it while it still feels good. Everybody say that. Work it while it still feels good. Say it again. Work it while it still feels good. That’s the secret to the healing process. If you can relieve pain at all through pressure, massage, light, fast stroking, if you can relieve it, don’t let the pain come back. If you wait till the pain comes back you’re a patient for life. If you can relieve that pain you’re getting oxygen in there, you’re turning those generators on, you keep that pain out, you keep it going and the body will heal. We’ve done this many, many times. We’ve got the diseases here and then we have shock. Now we know that stress is a mild form of shock and that’s why stress is related to the crippling killer diseases. Now let me ask you something. Now we’re getting to the good part. If stress can bring energy out of your body, can anger do it? Fear? Loss of temper? Holding grudges? Resentment? Now we’re going to teach you mentally, nutritionally and physically what causes those trapped proteins. I’m here in all humility to say this. If we want to stop the diseases in the world today, there’s"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #11 12 only one way we’re going to do it. Our bodies today have gotten to such a condition, there’s no other way out. We’ve got to prevent the disease and prevention is mental, nutritional and physical and everything else is treatment. Now, the herbs work. In the book I’m going to tell you how herbs work. It’s electrical, that’s why. All the homeopathic remedies work on frequencies. They’re electrical. The herbs are electrical. I said this one time in one of the meetings and a women from China said, “You’re right. We know the herbs are electrical. We’ve known this for thousands of years, but it’s all in Chinese.” Mentally. Anger, loss of temper, holding grudges causes trapped proteins. Proteins can reduce the energy field and cause trapped proteins. What are we going to have to learn to do with our enemies? That’s right. That didn’t come from a church so nobody can take offense to it. I want to tell you that I didn’t make that formula. The man who made the body made the formula. I just found it. Anybody who ignores that formula will cause destruction. Anger, loss of temper, holding grudges, results in trapped proteins and that tells us we have to love our enemies, literally. We have to get big enough so we can love our enemies and bless those that curse us and do good for those that hate us. The formula for death is the formula for war. The same mental attitudes that cause death in our bodies cause one man to kill another. The formula for health is the formula for peace. I’ve been in this for years and I’m telling you if we want peace on this earth, we’re not going to have peace in our families and the nation and the world until we learn to live the laws of health. The secret is in health. We’re talking about conquering disease and having peace on earth, but to have peace we’ve got to live the laws of health. I mean literally we have to raise up these golden families, to raise up the golden civilization we’ve been looking for. That’s what this formula is going to do. It’s all in the book. It’s loaded with this information. It’s there. Now people who are willing to conquer disease and have peace, and that means we’ve got to learn to love our enemies, bless those that curse us, do good to those that hate us. Nutritionally. Let me ask you a question. You have shock, you get thirsty, right? Stress makes you thirsty. True? Does stress make you thirsty? Anything you put in your mouth, here’s nutrition, anything you put in your mouth that makes you thirsty is not food is not a food it is a deadly poison. Not only is it a poison, it is a physically and mentally addictive drug. They are refined foods and they’re physically and mentally addicting drugs. Why do you think they’re putting these things there for you to look at? Anything that makes you thirsty - the salt, the sugar, the fat, high-cholesterol foods. What’s that? Someone said nothing. We know we’ve got the fruits and the vegetables and whole grains and sprouts and so forth, the meat and poultry and fish and so forth. I could go into this and go on and on about this. We’ve got it documented. The foods that make us thirsty are causing our death. Isn’t it interesting that the blood [indecipherable]. I tell you, as"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #11 13 we learn about the blood the destroying [indecipherable] passes us by. The blood is 91 percent water. The blood brings oxygen into the cells. When the blood comes out to irrigate the cells, the cells take the minerals and nutrients out of the blood and then the dead water is cast away. We have to eat foods with mostly water to replenish that blood. The foods that make you thirsty are poison. That’s nutritionally. Now to prevent it you’ve got to prevent it by eating the foods that don’t make you thirsty. With that formula, anybody who ignores the formula will commit suicide. They’ll cause their destruction. The next thing is physical and I’ve got to give you this. It won’t take a minute. When I was in Italy Dr. Jack Shield photographed the lymphatic system for the first time in the history of the world. Now that research says if the lymphatic system can’t keep the blood proteins circulating in the body, it can cause death. Well Dr. Shield photographed the lymphatic system. It’s like a tree inside the body. The branches go up in the hands. The roots go down the feet and the tree trunk is in the chest. The blood proteins come out of the blood stream under pressure. They can’t get back. The only way out is through those lymphatic vessels and they have one-way valves that keep the blood proteins coming up here. They bring them up this tree trunk which is the thoracic duct and they dump it back in the blood stream up here in the [indecipherable] vein. Then the body just plays ring-around-the-roses with the proteins. What moves lymphatic? [indecipherable] Those lymphoogists in Italy were not in agreement on this. They said exercise has nothing to do with lymphatics, a lot of them. Dr. Kathy Smith [?] in Australia talked about exercise and they laughed at him. Well I tell you, Dr. Shield photographed it. He moves the legs and guess what? It didn’t work. He was photographing. The lymph doesn’t hit the bloodstream. It’s like a tree. There’s not pump in that system. What moves it? Not only does it pull the proteins out, it keeps the poisons out, as we said earlier. It takes the poisons out of the blood to purify the blood. It takes the dead cells, the morbid matter, brings them down into here. And it eats them up before it dumps them back in the bloodstream. It’s the lymph system that purifies the body. The liver is a great detoxification plant but the liver is full of lymphatic and it drains right there in that tree trunk. The thymus gland is here. The white blood cells come from the bone marrow to the thymus gland. The thymus gland ships these off to the lymph nodes. The thymus gland is the key to the immune system and all our vital organs around this tree trunk. They had the guy move his leg. It didn’t move. He was walking around. It was a waste of time and energy. Just walking alone. He said, “I’m getting a lot of exercise.” All you get is tired varicose veins, true or false? Walking is not going to do it. Moved his arms. Still didn’t move. Then he had him do this. This was worth the entire trip to Italy and it will be worth your entire trip to this conference. He stood there and he had him"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #11 14 take a deep breath like this. [Breathes] Right there, at the peak of inhalation, the pressure came off that tree trunk and the lymph shot in the bloodstream, just like a geyser, just like an oil well. He said, “There it goes! There it goes!” This explains why the average lifespan of retirement is three to five years. The man who made the body said we had to work all the days of our lives, no retirement program. Right? No retirement program. A person goes into retirement he’s committing suicide. No retirement. We’ve got to breathe deep. It’s better to breathe deep five minutes a day than it is to exercise five minutes a day. Did you hear the guy who laughed himself well? The other one sang himself well? It’s whole. The Indians, before they did the war chant, all they did was “lymphoize.” They understood this thing. All during the battle all they did was lymphocize. The Indian knew he could reverse it. He had the secret to energy. The dances are all the same way. But the Indian understood. When the Indian wanted to die he didn’t die sick if he could help it. When he felt it was time to go he waved goodbye to his family, went to the burial grounds, sit still, didn’t move, breathed very shallowly and then in 24 hours he was dead from conditions caused by trapped blood proteins. That’s medical research. It can cause death within 24 hours if you sit still and don’t move and breathe shallowly. The blood proteins build up and the generators shut off. So prevention is three-fold. One is mental. That means we’ve got to get anger, loss of temper, holding grudges, resentment out of our hearts. I ask my children, “Do you want peace?” They say, “Oh yes, daddy.” Then I say, “You’ve got to get anger, loss of temper, holding grudges out of your heart.” You’ve got to stop fighting and quarreling. It causes stress in our bodies and loss of energy. You can feel it. You’ve got to stop eating foods that make you thirsty . Just as sure as you put your hand on a hot stove those blood proteins would cause death in just a few hours. You should feel it in minutes, and you can. You eat foods that make you thirsty and drain the energy out of your body. Your body will tell you. Just listen to it. It’ll give you the signs. Poison is the first sign of a poison. You’ve got to get anger, loss of temper, holding grudges. Love, blessing the good. You’ve got to stop eating foods that make you thirsty. Eat foods that’s mostly water that dissolve minerals to replenish that blood. You do that and you can reverse those diseases. Jackie and all those others who’ve reversed cancer, that’s exactly the foods that they ate. They went to the foods that didn’t make them thirsty. That’s how they reversed their cancer and all the other diseases. This is what happens. Dr. Campbell, who reversed arthritis, he took people off the foods that make them thirsty. The arthritis joints come back perfect. He says eat salt and sugar, he can’t help you. If you have arthritis and eat salt and sugar you can’t help anybody because the salt and sugar will trap those blood proteins back and get rid of them. That’s mental. "},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #11 15 Let’s do physical. Physical, you’ve got to breathe deep. That means you just don’t walk around the house. That’s a waste of time and energy. When you walk around you go [inhales and exhales], something, but you breathe deep. One last comment. The [indecipherable] Indians in northwest Mexico. I’ve seen pictures of these people. Dr. West from California went down there. He shows them running from sun up to sun up with no fatigue in their body. Sun up to sun up. Man running holding torches at night, guess who’s running with them? The women and the children. They’re the toughest runners in the world. They asked them, the chief, “Chief, why do you run the way you do?” And the chief said, “We run because we run. It is necessary. That is all.” Well the interviewer said, “Whatever the reason, they sure run well.” Now we know that the chief gave the answer, “We run because we run.” And we’re going to go down the road tomorrow going [inhales and exhales]. “What are you doing?” Say, “I’m lymphocizing. We’re like the [indecipherable] Indians.” He says, “Why do you do that?” “We lymphocize because we lymphocize. It is necessary and that is all.” True or false? [Applause and laughter] May the Lord bless you. I want to tell you that the answer’s in the formula. I know it and I bear my witness to you this day. If you’ll get that book, “The Golden Seven Plus One” when it comes off the press. I have turned down millionaires who wanted to make millions and take advantage of this. I’ll die to protect this research. We’re going to have family health education standards in every city throughout the world. It’s going to happen and no one gets turned away due to financial circumstances. Just keep aware of what we’re doing. I hope to work with the Gerson Institute on this. Thank you.  [Applause]  May the Lord bless you. Thank you very much. The address is PO Box 351, Orem, Utah. 84057 is the zip. The name of the book is “The Golden Seven Plus One.” Seven major discoveries in that formula. It’s loaded with information. All of this is in there. Zip code is 84057. Orem, o-r-e-m. PO Box 351, Orem, Utah 84057. Send 20 dollars to that address. It’s a donation. It’s you starter kit. Why? Because when you get the book, when the book is published we’re coming out with a way to get that formula and to get this research into thousands and thousands of homes. Everybody who gets that book is going to be a distributor of it. May the Lord bless you and thank you. A Christmas present, I hope. Norman: Well, you see, Dr. West has some very important information. This is the reason that we are trying to bring all these various experts in the natural healing therapies together. We know that all of us are never going to completely agree with each"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #11 16 other and we don’t think we should.

These are a unique collection of lectures and testimonials based on the work and research of Dr. Max Gerson, his family and colleagues. So please, sit back and relax and enjoy the great health information you’re about to hear. Please remember, the information contained in this program is not intended to replace a one-on-one relationship with a qualified healthcare professional and is not intended as medical advice. It is intended as a sharing of knowledge and information from the research and experience of the Gerson Institute and its affiliates. We encourage you to make your own healthcare decisions based upon your research and in partnership with a qualified healthcare professional. Norman: It can be healed. And even when they see it, very often, they still can’t believe it because they think it must’ve been a fluke, it must’ve been a wrong diagnosis, it must’ve been a spontaneous remission, all kinds of reasons. So all we can do is keep putting the message out. We think that if we continue to do this then gradually this will change people’s consciousness. Charlotte: A number of the people here, we don’t have everybody yet, but we have a lovely group. The first thing I’d like to do is to have you take a look at them. They look well. We had them at the clinic last night.  [Applause]  It was very remarkable that there was a glow of health about them. You do want to remember that a whole number of them had cancer and were dying. Others have other diseases and were told either there was no help for them or that they would die. It doesn’t have to be. There are other diseases that’ll kill you, it doesn’t have to be cancer. So I’d like to refer you to the program which you have. You will see in the program short histories of their cases and their situations so that you can go back, later, and see their problems and reread them and refresh your memory and get their pictures, their images, so that you can compare and understand their problems and can go back to them in your mind. The first one I wanted to talk about once more was Mary Lee. She isn’t here right now? Well, we’ll defer her for a minute because we have a very interesting gentleman right here. Come on up, Ed. We unfortunately don’t have enough time to give everybody a word but we’ll talk and give you a little background on Ed. Let’s see, where have we got him? There he is. Ed Dowd was my father’s patient, Dr. Gerson’s patient. He is described in the"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #12 - Bonus 2 book as case number 14. He’s marked as reverend Ed. He was a reverend at the time. He is no longer in the ministry. Ed had a small mole on the back of his neck for many years and in ‘54 it started to grow and was removed and biopsied. Melanoma. It had metastasized. The surgeon recommended a radical neck dissection. Do you know what a radical neck dissection is? They take a whole part of the neck and some of the arteries and the muscles and all of this out, really mutilating. It looks like you have only half a neck left. You do function but it is no help. In almost every case of melanoma, you get a radical neck dissection, that’s great. Then it comes up somewhere else. We have one patient, I don’t think he’s here, he is described also in the book, who had one of these radical neck dissections and within five months the whole area of the surgery and the scar tissue was full of new melanoma. Cutting out a piece does not help, as you are now aware from my previous lecture. It does not help. So Ed very wisely refused. He also had glands already swollen under both armpits and in his groin. So he came to Dr. Gerson in New York. After a very few days, was it about a week or so, multiple lumps and bumps had disappeared. About seven days, Ed says. It’s interesting that, particularly with melanoma which is a very violent, highly malignant type of cancer, we have some of our best results. The body most rapidly recognizes these foreign tissues as malignant, digests them, gets rid of them and the body recovers. You’ll see other melanoma patients here. Now Ed, about seven months after he was on the therapy, he was taking a niacin, which is part of the therapy, and he got a heavy flush, an unusually heavy niacin flush, when the face sort of prickles and the ears get red and you get a little prickly in the top of your body. It’s just vitamin B3, that’s all it is. It helps open the capillaries, which is the idea. Well, Ed got one of these niacin flushes just before Christmas and he was quite convinced that he had gotten a divine healing and he went off the therapy. His body was not yet healed. So after one month he started to get a new tumor on his right breast. Another month it had grown larger and he could no longer stand a jacket on it, it was hurting. Another month, it was close to Easter, he couldn’t even put his shirt on anymore. He was in pain. He called Dr. Gerson in New York. What did Dr. Gerson say? Ed: He said, “I will send you a letter telling you what to do, but immediately go back on the original therapy.” I did that. He said there would be pain for about a week. It was right in my right nipple, this recurrence. It was about ten months after I had had the first excision of a lymph node in my neck. So he said, “Go back and in about seven days your pain will stop. But you’ll always have scar tissue in your nipple.” Well, I happen to have a responsive system and I had no pain about the second day and my nipple is very soft, has never had any scar tissue. Charlotte: Wonderful. Okay, so that time then Ed stayed on the therapy as he was supposed to, the whole time. Then he went of the therapy. Now he eats quite regularly,"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #12 - Bonus 3 quite normally. He eats outs in restaurants, he eats other ways and as you see, how many years later is it now? Ed: Twenty-seven. Charlotte: Twenty-seven years later, he is fine.  [Applause]  Thank you for coming. Since we are on the subject of melanoma, we have this very lovely young lady here, Debbie Dole. Come on up Debbie, will you? Where’s your picture? Do you know? Debbie, who is now 29. [Debbie speaks inaudibly] Sorry about that, oh dear. She’s 27. [Laughter] Debbie led a pretty poor lifestyle for a while. She was a waitress in a restaurant and she had access to lots of drinks. She was drinking tequila. It’s not only alcohol, it’s salt around the edge. That’s pretty bad. She was smoking. She was drinking a lot of coffee and eating not very good foods. Anyway, about three years ago she had her first tumor, melanoma, on her arm. They cut out the tumor, diagnosed it and found it was melanoma. So then they did a deep excision. They really cut. They scraped down to nearly the bone, not quite. They said, “We got it all.” How long did it take until it came back? Debbie: Six months. Charlotte: Six months she had a new one, under her arm. They wanted to cut again, cut and cut and cut. She said, “Wait a minute. I had my operation. They already cut it out. They already told me it was all gone. How come it came back? What do you expect with another operation?” She refused. She came instead to the Gerson clinic. That was how long ago? Debbie: August of ‘78. Charlotte: In August of ‘78. So that’s three years and roughly two months. The tumor went down and disappeared. How long did that take? Debbie: A month. Charlotte: It took about a month. You see it already takes a little longer than it used to take in my father’s days because people are more toxic, more damaged. It takes a little longer. But in a month the melanoma tumor had disappeared. Debbie stayed very"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #12 - Bonus 4 close to the therapy for a year and a half. She’s still staying close to the right foods, she still drinks some of the juices, she still takes good care of herself and she remains well. No new tumors. She is well, she is active. She lives in the Bay Area and she does help other people there when they’re interested on going on the therapy to find sources for foods and vegetables. She is lovely and helpful and wanting to help others. I guess partially in gratitude for her healing. Do you have any special words for us? I don’t want to embarrass you. Thank you very much for coming Debbie.  [Applause]  Let’s get off the melanoma patients for a minute. Here too, again, I would like to state that the Gerson Therapy is not a cancer therapy just by itself. It is not specific for a disease. We help the body to heal itself and with the body healing itself all these diseases disappear. We have Marge Lemlay [?] here. You can read her story too. Do you want to come up here? We are now on page four on the bottom. In 1976 she had a heart attack, a nervous breakdown. She had sharp chest pains. She was on oxygen. She couldn’t breathe, unable to move, extreme breathing difficulties. Her doctors prescribed digitalis, nitroglycerin. She refused to take it. And Valium and Enderol. All that she refused to take. That is fortunate because once these patients are on drugs and chemicals it’s much harder to heal them. They can still be healed, but it’s much, much more difficult. The drugs present a much more serious problem than the disease. So then she started and was diagnosed as having emphysema. She was constantly on oxygen. She had diarrhea. She was bedfast. They gave her a high-protein diet, which made her sicker, of course. She had lost weight and was down to 76 pounds. What are you now? Marge: 100. Charlotte. 100 pounds. Marge: I did go up to 115 therapy. The last six months I’ve leveled off where I am. Charlotte: So your weight went down a little? Okay. So she’s about 100 now. She started the Gerson Therapy in October of ‘79. So that’s two years ago. How long did it take you until you really felt better? Marge: About nine months. Charlotte: So there too, you see, it’s a long haul. You have to really restore, rebuild, reactivate the body and all its systems. Do you have any more problems"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #12 - Bonus 5 breathing? Marge: No. Charlotte: Emphysema bother you any? Marge: Car fumes and smoke bother me very much, but normally I’m fine. Charlotte: No real problems. Your heart is okay? Marge: Yes. Excellent. Charlotte: No real problems. And you have good energy? Marge: Yes.  Charlotte: Do you have any special words you’d like to say? Marge: I thank God for leading me to Charlotte. I had a long search. After I was sick and could finally get up and crawl around with my husband’s help, he did all the cooking and house cleaning for a year, I tried nine different nutritionists, chiropractors and MDs trying to find help. It took me two years to get to the clinic. Thank God I came to a National Health Federation lecture and heard Charlotte two years ago because it saved my life. I hope that it will save someone else’s.  [Applause]  Charlotte: Now we have another patient who was Dr. Gerson’s patient. She’s not in the book. There are a whole number of patients Dr. Gerson helped and treated that did not get in the book. He selected specific types and representative cases. They were by no means all of the ones he cured. We have another lady here now by the name of Rosa Moray. She had a malignant polyp in 1953 in the intestinal tract. She had blood in her stool. She had pain, weakness. The head of rectal surgery at Stanford University Medical School did the biopsy. Now this is something I’d like to stress. We never do our own biopsies. We have been accused of lying and cheating and falsifying and quackery. We never do our own biopsies for that reason. Patients always come with a biopsy already, all the way from Stanford to Boston General, all the way from Mayo to MD Anderson. They are not our words, they are the word of the top authorities that these patients do indeed have the disease that they claim to have. They are diagnosed by the orthodox institutions, their own records, not ours. It was a malignant polyp 13 centimeters up from the rectum. The doctor said that"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #12 - Bonus 6 without a colostomy she had less than 10 percent chance for survival. She went to Dr. Gerson’s New York clinic in October of 1953. She got married in 1955 and here she is 28 years later. Do you have any words for us? Rosa: Oh, yes. Actually, I nearly bled to death because the cancer really ate through into a blood vessel and the blood just poured out of me. I had gotten into a real emergency and that’s what made them do the diagnosis, although I’d been having bleeding for quite a long time. It was wonderful the way I healed up. I would have examinations month after month while I was on the Gerson diet. It got so the doctor’s couldn’t even find a scar in the colon as to where the cancer had been. It was really wonderful. Furthermore, I had always had terrible migraine headaches and Dr. Gerson told me, “You’ll never have a headache on this diet and you’ll never have a cold.” It was true. That’s the way it was.  [Applause]  Charlotte: Thank you very much Rosa. All these people have very interesting stories. Unfortunately in order to show them all we have to make the stories short. So if you wish to talk to them later, they have tan tags marked “Gerson Person.” They are identified so you can talk to them and ask them questions later. Now I’d like to introduce you to another very charming young lady, Deanna Powell, who had severe rheumatoid arthritis. She was virtually wheelchair-bound. She was stiff and swollen in all her joints. It started in 1970. Come here Deanna. I like to have her at the end of the stage to just show you how she walks.  [Applause]  When she came to us she was like this. All her joints swollen stiff, her knees, her legs, her ankles, her arms, her elbows, her wrists. On top of that she was in severe pain, on lots of aspirin. How many? Deanna: 30 a day. Charlotte: 30 a day. Deanna: Just for the swelling, not for the pain. Charlotte: Not for the pain. It didn’t really help with the pain. Now you know that aspirins cause other problems. She had hypoglycemia, she had anemia. What else did you have? Deanna: Heart palpitations. Aspirin poisoning. I could hear the ringing at night. "},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #12 - Bonus 7 Charlotte: Labored breathing and she had all kinds of difficulties. She started with the therapy in May of ‘78. In six weeks most of the pain was gone, most of the lumps began to dissolve. She started to get some movement in her wrists. Her wrists are not yet totally well. They only improve on the liver juice. Without the liver juice these bony deformities are not dissolved. Only as long as she was on the liver juice. But she’s satisfied with the way she is doing so some of these lumps are still in her wrists. Her fingers are now mostly straight. She has much better circulation. Do you still have a problem with hypoglycemia? Deanna: No. Charlotte: Or any of the other problems? Deanna: I have occasionally, if I have too much honey or something like that, but basically no. I know how to straighten myself out. Charlotte: Heart palpitations? Deanna: No. Charlotte: All of that is gone? The lungs are clear of mucus. She has good energy and she went waterskiing. Deanna: Yes, this summer. Charlotte: That’s what we want to talk about when we talk about healing. People go back to a normal life. She was facing the wheelchair and felt like she was a prisoner in her own body, tied down, racked in pain. Now she is a happy, healthy, lovely, active young lady. Thank you.  [Applause]  Now I’d like to introduce you, since we are on the charming young people here, to Jim Clark. It bothers him that I say things like that. Jim had a very specific, peculiar problem, unusual. Let’s see, what page are you on, Jim? Page four, right here, next to the top there, second one from the top on page four. Thank you. Jim came to us when he was 31 years old. He had not been able to sleep in some three and a half months. He had a whole bunch of problems, heart palpitations. He was disoriented. He couldn’t concentrate. He was terribly depressed. He had constant infections. He was constantly on drugs and antibiotics. He just wasn’t functioning. He had searched for help. He had gone to doctors. The doctors didn’t find anything wrong with him. They checked and checked and checked and found nothing wrong. Here’s a case of a problem that didn’t really have a diagnosis. The doctor said there was nothing wrong, it was all in his head. But he knew he had"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #12 - Bonus 8 heart palpitations and he couldn’t sleep. The drugs didn’t help. Sleeping pills didn’t help. He was so full of drugs, and we’ll come to that in a minute. His mother was nurse. Every time, when he was a little fellow, every time he had a cold, a bug, a flu, a fever, off to the doctor. Antibiotics, shots, more shots, aspirin and everything, all the way down the line, antibiotics to sulfur drugs. That little fellow was poisoned from the beginning. His immune system didn’t have a chance. When he was 17 he had an automobile accident, he had an injury to his left ankle. It wouldn’t heal. He got a staph infection. It wouldn’t heal. They started to patch skin from the other leg on it. It wouldn’t take. They had him in the hospital for a year when he was 18 since it absolutely wouldn’t budge. They cut his leg off below the knee. That took care of the ankle but not of his other problems. His underlying problems remained. He continued to have infections - drugs, chemicals, antibiotics all the time. By the time he was 31 he was full of drugs that he just wasn’t functioning. He now also is engaged in rowing. He is winning. He is active. He is well. It took a long time to get those drugs out of his body but he had almost an immediate response to the therapy. The first night he slept an hour and a half. The second night he started to sleep normally. It was a struggle to restore his body. It took time. How long did it take? Jim: It took about six months to really start feeling well. Charlotte: Jim has a PhD. He teaches. He is functioning fully again. He is teaching, writing. He is normal, active, young man going after his profession. Again here we have a case without a regular medical diagnosis, but despairing of life. I think you were thinking of suicide, you told me. Despairing because of these problems that had no medical answer and he was beginning to believe that there was something wrong with his brain, with his mind. He is fully restored and he is fine. Do you have a few words to say? Jim: I think what I have to say is that if it’s true that each of us influences 250 other people, go influence 250 other people. Thank you.  [Applause]  Charlotte: Thank you very much. I’d like to remind you that these people took the trouble of coming from all over the United States and a couple of them from Canada, one gentleman from Mexico, to be here with us so that we could see and talk to them and hear them. Later on you can also get their experiences, if you are interested. To show healing, to help others. We have a gentleman now by the name of William With [?]. That’s a German"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #12 - Bonus 9 name, isn’t it Bill? All right. Come on over here. You are now 82? Bill: 82 is right. Charlotte: 82, wow. He had prostate cancer that was metastasized to his bones in December of 1976. Who did the diagnosis? A medical doctor, urologist in El Paso, Texas. William came all the way from El Paso. He had difficultly urinating. He was hospitalized in March of ‘77 and he had prostate cancer diagnosed. It was biopsied? Bill: Yes, it was. Charlotte: Okay. He had bilateral lymph node involvement and he had a lymph node dissection. Then he a bone scan in June of ‘78 showed metastases in the bones, the left lower ribs. In other words, of course, radiation does not heal cancer. It spread to the lymph nodes. Then they removed his testicles which is supposed to reduce the hormone involvement, which is nonsense too. It really does not cure cancer, especially not bone cancer. He started the Gerson Therapy in December of ‘79. The bone scan in March of ‘81 showed no cancer anywhere in his bones. How do you feel now, Bill? Bill: Excellent. Charlotte: Are you working? Bill: Well, I’m very active. I’ll say that. Many of the organizations I belong to, I work at my church and other places. I can do anything I want to do. I just installed a solar system in my home. Charlotte: Wonderful. Thank you very, very much for coming. Bill: I appreciate the fine services I got at the hospital here. Charlotte: Bill was at the La Gloria Hospital in Mexico, under the care of the Mexican doctors with the Gerson Therapy. He got help there. He got well. That’s the main thing. Bill: Thank you.  [Applause]  Charlotte: Okay. Now I’d like to talk to you about Don Linsed [?],over here. He was diagnosed and he had a lot of problems before he was diagnosed. It’s a long story. It’s also on page four. In 1975 he had insomnia, anxiety, the shakes. His tongue"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #12 - Bonus 10 and jaw went into spasms. In ‘76 he had six months in psychotherapy. He became a vegetarian and improved temporarily. In ‘77 his condition worsened. He had severe depression. A wart on his stomach became dark and began growing. It was, of course, suspicious of melanoma. In 1978 he had convulsions. He became hospitalized. There’s no diagnosis. He had liver pains. He lost consciousness. In February he had spasms in the right side, weakness. His right leg went numb and he had aphasia. He couldn’t talk properly. He couldn’t coordinate his speech and brain for talking. Two brain scans showed a brain tumor larger than a golf ball in the left rear center speech area. Inoperable. No biopsy possible. Six specialists confirmed the diagnosis. In March of ‘78 he tried the Kelly Therapy. In April of ‘78 he began the Gerson Therapy. He went off of all the drugs and he had a gradual improvement. No further symptoms. His dark, growing wart disappeared in two months. If it was melanoma or not is immaterial. The brain scan in 1979 showed the tumor size much reduced and decreased in density. In January 1980 he started back to work. Don, what are you doing now? Don: I’m back working, for the airlines. Charlotte: He works for the airlines. He’s an instructor. So it takes a lot of work. And you feel generally good? Don: Yeah, I feel great now. Have for a couple of years. I just want to say I’m happy to be back in San Diego. I was here in 1962 at the [indecipherable] air station out there, terrorizing the skies around San Diego. It’s a great town. I’m happy to be here, especially under these circumstances. The story about what was wrong with me is all here in the book. I can’t add much to it. Charlotte: It’s quite a story. Even that we had to abbreviate because it was so long. Don: I was in bed for a year, pretty much the whole year. I couldn’t do much of anything. Pillows on both sides of my head. But I came out of it and here I am. Charlotte: That’s the most important thing, to come out of it, to get back to normal life and living, to get to feeling well, being active. That’s the most important thing and that’s what we want to talk about when we talk about healing. Thank you, very much. I’m not sure that we have time for questions. [inaudible audience member] Don: I haven’t had one since October of ‘79. "},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #12 - Bonus 11 Charlotte: But since he’s active and working and feeling good, in many of these cases we have to assume that they continue to be well. The reason why we assume is obviously that they’re symptom-free. In a number of these cases they simply refuse to submit to more radiation or diagnoses. Don: I don’t want to go in there and have another one. I just don’t want to do it. Besides that, they cost 350 dollars. [Laughter and applause] Charlotte: Don has a lovely story about coffee enemas. You already know a very important part of the detoxifying of the Gerson Therapy is the regular use of coffee enemas, in the beginning of the treatment as often as four and five a day. Now Don has a wonderful story. Don: I have a little boy, he was two years old. He had just turned two when I first got sick. So he has grown up with my being on the Gerson Therapy, the whole time. He just thinks that everybody is that way. He thinks that’s normal. We went over to some people’s house for a little party and comes up to me in this real confidential tone of voice and he looks up and he says, “Dad.” I said, “What Chris?” He said, “Those people over there are drinking coffee.” [Laughter and applause] Charlotte: That is weird, isn’t it? I think your answer was, “There’s some weird people everywhere.” You do want to remember that coffee taken by mouth seems to have almost the opposite effect of coffee taken rectally. By mouth into the stomach the acid upsets and disturbs the stomach. They cause capillary spasms and cramps. They cause adrenal function to be stimulated. They cause heart and other stimulation. They are actually stimulant drugs. When you use them rectally they travel to the portal system and help the liver and bile ducts to open with very little other effect on the circulatory system. None of these effects become obvious if they are taken in the context of the full therapy. Now I have to warn people not to use one thing or another out of the Gerson Therapy and expect to be cured. The therapy is a total integrated whole. We have to treat it as such. We cannot say, “Okay, coffee enemas will cure cancer.” That’s ridiculous. We need to detoxify and rebuild very intensively. None of the techniques we use, by themselves, work. They have to be the full, total therapy. Now I’d like to introduce you to another very charming young lady over here to my left, Carol Rennick. She’s 21. Sometimes people have birthdays and our numbers here are not always 100 percent accurate, just the age because it changes"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #12 - Bonus 12 every year. She was diagnosed as having nodular schlerosing Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. She had a swelling in her neck diagnosed in October 1980. The operation removed the supersternal mass, under the sternum. Diagnosis as above, Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. Her sister died from Ewing’s Sarcoma when the sister was 17. She had received radiation and chemotherapy. The family had seen the horrible results of it and the horrible suffering as a result of these treatments. Carol, with the support of her family, refused chemotherapy, although she was told, “We have 85-95 percent results. It works marvelous in Hodgkin’s. It’s great. It’s wonderful.” But you see, I’d like to mention here how some of these figures come about, with Hodgkin’s. For instance, there was a lady who told me about her daughter, she was 23. She’d been on chemotherapy for about two and a half years for Hodgkin’s. Sure enough she was doing quite well, the tumors had disappeared, she was active, she was working. Except one day she caught a cold. In five days she had pneumonia and in ten days she was dead. What did the death certificate say she died from? Pneumonia. Therefore she was cured of Hodgkin’s, right? These are some of the distortions. That’s not a single individual case or a rare exception. These are the problems of orthodox statistics, if you’re going to believe them. Anyway, Carol was told she was crazy, she was foolish to go into Mexico to get healed, to go on this wild goose chase, the Gerson Therapy, nutrition and food has nothing to do with cancer. She came last December, or late November. Sorry, she came in November of 1980, to the clinic in Mexico, just short of a year. At the time she had lumps showing on her neck, she had also a mass in her chest, right? Carol: In my upper mid-abdomen. Charlotte: Upper mid-abdomen. The mass was palpable. Carol: There were several. They didn’t tell me how many. I guess it really didn’t matter. Charlotte: Right, it doesn’t matter. If there’s more than one that’s too many. So she started on the Gerson Therapy and by late December what did the doctor say? Carol: It was really March. I’d had a CT scan done, it’s like intensive radiation on my abdomen. I didn’t want to get it done again for a couple of months. I had it done in March and it was normal. It was nothing. So I talked to my doctors and I said, “Well how do you explain this? I’m supposed to be dead in a year to two years.” He asked me, “Do you have any religious beliefs?” I said, “Yes I do.” He said, “I think you’re a miracle.” So far everything is going okay. I’d like to also say, I have a friend of mine who’s my age who has the same thing"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #12 - Bonus 13 I do. When I met her I was never sick and we got to be the best of friends. After I got sick and decided to go to Mexico she hasn’t spoken to me. We don’t speak anymore because she went the regular way and got chemotherapy. Right now she has Hodgkin’s in her bones now. It’s in her skull and her collarbone and her hipbone. She’s dying. I see her now and she can’t talk because we went our separate ways. But she sees me doing well and I wonder sometimes if she just wonder, “Maybe I should’ve done what Carol did instead of what I did.” Charlotte: Thank you very much, Carol.  [Applause]  Carol, too, came a long way to be here with us. She is all the way from Pennsylvania. These are, of course, very important considerations, the fact that in a way, when you do something like the Gerson Therapy, when you break away from orthodoxy, you go into a very difficult social situation. You’re going to lose friends. You’re going to have trouble visiting. You have trouble going to dinner parties, going out to restaurants. Eric Goodman here, told me yesterday, he was traveling in Europe. He’s fully recovered now and he travels but he’s still careful when he’s eating. So when he went into a restaurant in Europe, tell us what happened to you there. We’ll talk about his problems later but he had an interesting experience that I’d like to bring up. Eric: The doctors gave me six months to live if I do not accept their medical goodies - radiation, chemotherapy and surgery. Charlotte: I’d like you to tell us what happened at the restaurant when you went to Europe. Eric: Oh, in Verona, and also in several cities, I went to fancy restaurants to get vegetarian food and the waiters went into a conference. There were three waiters. Then they called the manager and then the owner. The owner came, very apologetic, and he said that the silverware, the placemats and everything cost too much money to serve vegetarian food and if I would be kind enough if I would go over the next block to a tataria [?] and get a salad over there. Charlotte: Thank you. We’ll talk about the other problems later. I’d like to close this particular presentation on that lighter note. But I do want to stress, again, that the Gerson therapy is not easy and it causes you these problems. Who have we got here? Marge Lemlay’s husband. This is Dale Lemlay [?]. Dale: Ladies and Gentlemen this next section is not on your schedule. I’m what is known as a Gerson-Person spouse. I have a two-fold claim to fame. I probably gave my wife her nervous breakdown and in payment I got to the do the housework for the next year. That’s why she got better sooner, because I’m a"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #12 - Bonus 14 lousy housekeeper. [Laughter] But this is for Charlotte. Charlotte, you’ve given so many spouses back their spouses that the people who are sitting behind you today, in honor of your father’s 100 th birthday and with love, admiration and appreciation, they have this token for you.  [Applause]  Charlotte: That’s fantastic. Let’s see if I can open this. It’s like Christmas is here. Oh, how beautiful. Isn’t that lovely. Thank you. Thank you, Dale. I’d like to just read you the inscription. “Presented to Charlotte Gerson in honor of the anniversary of Dr. Max Gerson’s 100 th birthday. With love, admiration and appreciation, the healed, incurable. Natural Healing Convention San Diego, California 18 th of October 1981.” The 18 th is actually Dr. Gerson’s birthday. So we are a day ahead, but that’s why that date is on here. It’s signed by a whole number of these people. It’s a lovely vase.

Norman: ...cancer couldn’t be cured by a lot of doctors because he lived with Dr. Gerson. In addition to that he had the privilege of visiting with Dr. Schweitzer. He is Charlotte’s son, she sometimes says “her little boy.” Howard Strauss.  [Applause]  Howard: Thank you. I’m here actually to share with you a couple of personal notes. I’m not a doctor. I’m not in medicine. I had the privilege of growing up around Dr. Gerson and because of that I had some relatively interesting experiences and a relatively different outlook than I found out most people had. I lived with him for several years because his apartment was much closer to my school than my parents’ house was and to prevent a long commute I stayed with my grandparents during the week. I also spent quite a few weekends at my grandfather’s clinic, up in upstate New York. He had two at different times. Spending weekends at a cancer clinic might not sound like a very fun experience, but strangely enough all these people were feeling better for the first time in years so it was very much of an up experience. My grandfather had a way of inspiring people to efforts to fight this dreaded thing that was attacking them. They knew that they could win if they followed the therapy and detoxified their systems. I grew up knowing, as surely as if I put my hand on a stove it would get burned, I grew up knowing that if I ate properly I would be healthy and if I didn’t eat properly I wouldn’t be healthy. This is something that apparently is not common knowledge. It was quite a shock for me to learn, in my late teens, that cancer was something that couldn’t be cured because it was something that I had grown up watching people recover from. I knew if you got cancer you went to my grandfather and went on the diet and you got better. It was sometimes a fairly lengthy process, but it was doable, like many of our other diseases were curable. I also had another interesting outlook. The AMA, to me, was an organization formed to harass doctors. I don’t know why that happened. It was one of those just givens of my life."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #13 - Bonus 2 I consider myself very lucky to have grown up that way, because I don’t suffer from a lot of the diseases that a lot of other people do. I am very, very seldom even slightly sick. I consider myself lucky because of that. I’ve also had some very interesting meetings with people, one or two who are very famous and well-known in the public eye, such as Albert Schweitzer, and many who are not so famous but are, I think, as heroic or more heroic. My meeting with Albert Schweitzer was quite...well, it wasn’t accidental. I was traveling in Europe with my grandmother shortly after my grandfather’s death and Albert Schweitzer, who was a great friend and admirer of Dr. Gerson, invited us to his home to spend the day. He had his ancestral home in Gun spa [?], in the Alsace-Lorraine. I was aware of who he was and I was quite in awe. But as we sat down to a very plain, German farmer’s lunch with a charming group of people, including a harpsichordist and a couple of Swiss farmer’s and Schweitzer and his secretary. It became clear to me that this was not a man to be afraid of. He was a beautiful man, a very humble, a very lovely man, very personable man. He spoke very highly of my grandfather with my grandmother, at the time. He chatted with me. We took a ride into the nearest larger town later that afternoon. Mind you, this was farm country, a very small town in the Alsace. Between there and the nearest larger town there are very few roads. There was one dirt road crossing the major road that we were traveling on. This dirt road, which went apparently from nowhere to nowhere had been named Rue Albert Schweitzer. He sort of tapped my grandmother on the shoulder very proudly and said, “Look, they named the street after me,” almost unaware of what his image was in the rest of the world. I’m sure he wasn’t unaware, but it never affected him. He was a lovely man. The other people that I have been as impressed or perhaps even more impressed by are people like the people that you see here sitting up on stage, many of whom knee high to a grasshopper. They were patients of my grandfather’s and since I spent weekends at the clinic, I met them and I played around the clinic. These people are quite extraordinary people, every one of them. Extraordinary because they have gone through an experience that is a very unique experience and a very intense experience, facing a killer disease that they knew perfectly well was absolutely fatal, but still trying their best to fight it, not giving up, not lying down and taking it. Saying, “I’m going to beat this thing,” and actually committing themselves to the struggle against it and following this treatment, which is not an easy thing to do. It’s quite a major change of lifestyle, a major effort, a major expense to go through. To an average person changing every dietary thing that he ever learned is not easy. These people have, to me, been really quite heroes, each and every one of them. I admire every one of them. They’re lovely people. I felt very privileged to know them. I thank you all for coming to meet them as well and to see these people and to"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #13 - Bonus 3 honor my grandfather, among others, who have been rejected by the medical establishment but have a story to tell, a very valid story, an important story and one that must be told. Thank you very much.  [Applause]  Norman: Thank you, Howard. Now this afternoon we’re going to continue with more presentations of the healed incurables. In addition to Charlotte we have Dr. Art Artunio [?] who is the medical director at Hospital La Gloria where the Gerson Therapy is given. Charlotte, I’ll let you handle this with Art.  [Applause]  Art: I’m short. I need a stand. First of all, I would like to introduce one of our former patients, Mr. Jesus Lachuga. He is from Mexico. Mr. Lachuga is 58 years old. He came to us about two years ago exactly, in October, with the diagnosis of cancer of the lung, metastases to lymph nodes. He was given only three to six months to live. He started the therapy with us back in October 1978. Mr. Lachuga has been following our therapy since then, for approximately one year and eight months. Here is Mr. Lachuga.  [Applause]  Jesus: [Speaks Spanish] Art: [Translating] He only wants to say one word. I don’t know if I’m going to live one more day or many years. But if I continue feeling the way I do, I will follow the Gerson Therapy no matter how. Jesus: That’s all. Art: Thank you.  [Applause]  Charlotte: Thank you, Dr. Art and Senor Lachuga, who came all the way from Durango, Mexico to be with us. We are particularly happy to have him here, to present him, because since we do work at the clinic in Mexico, since the patients are housed in Mexico, we feel that we don’t want to have the image of helping only Americans. We are particularly happy that Senor Lachuga came and was able to find help in his native land, even though some of us are not native Mexicans. Let us now proceed to the presentation of some of our patients. You have already heard and seen Mary Lee Rourke, but since she was on early I’d like to repeat a"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #13 - Bonus 4 little bit about her story, in case some of you did not hear or see her. Mary Lee started to have a problem with her eye and she had a lacrimal carcinoma in the duct, her tear duct. That was in 1973. By that time the globe of her eye was invaded. She isn’t here. Maybe she’ll show up later. We’ll go to the next patient. We have Anna Womac. Anna Womac had a different problem. Unfortunately it’s a very common one now a days - the mastectomy, the breast cancer. Where is Anna? Come on up. She is on page 14 on the bottom left. In 1978 she had a right mastectomy. Unfortunately you know how common mastectomies are and you know how in spite of that the mortality rate with breast cancer keeps rising and rising. It is a very terrible cancer. The mastectomies don’t help, don’t work. As you already know, they do not heal or reach the underlying problem and simply cutting off the breast does not answer the question. So she had a mastectomy and a biopsy. Nine months later she had, under her left arm, another lump and she had three good-sized lumps in the other breast. Anna had done a great deal of reading and learning about other therapies and she decided to use the Gerson therapy. She came to the Mexican clinic just two years ago, it will be two years in November, in 1979, with a lump on her arm and three good-sized tumors recurring now in the other breast. It took about seven months and they started to reduce. How long until they were completely gone? Anna: [inaudible]  Charlotte: By the end of the first year on the therapy Anna says the lumps were completely gone. She also says that she has a constant increase in well-being and in energy. I think you can see that she looks well, she’s active. You may have also seen her helping her husband with the audio-taping of the speakers at this convention. As you probably know, all the speakers are being taped and you will be able to buy the tapes of the speeches almost immediately after the speakers end their talks. So Anna has been working and is active and is feeling well. Here she is. Do you have some words to say? Anna: Yes. I’d like for each and every one of you to give me a good, swift kick all over the convention for not going to the Gerson Clinic before I had the mastectomy because I really have to admit that I knew Charlotte and knew of the therapy. Why on earth I didn’t go, I really could not answer that for you. But I should have gone because the first mastectomy, the mastectomy that I had, only had one lump that was malignant and the mass that I had in the second breast, I know I could have saved the first breast had I gone. Charlotte has been such a beautiful example. She really does live the Gerson Therapy, which is an example for all of us. Thank you."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #13 - Bonus 5  [Applause]  Charlotte: Thank you so much Anna. Well, I see Eddie managed to find Mary Lee. Here she is. Let me go back to her situation. She had her eye removed in 1972. She then subsequently got radiation the next spring. How many months later? Mary Lee: About four. Charlotte: About four months later, 6,000 rads of cobalt to the head. Of course that was supposed to completely eradicate any possible tumor cells that were still floating around, burn them, get rid of them and you find nothing left. Nothing left except she continued to feel ill and depressed and at the end of another two years a routine chest x-ray now showed nodules all through her lungs. It looked like you took a bunch of pennies and threw them across her lungs. You could see all the nodules. Since it was all over her lungs they were obviously inoperable and they could not be radiated. She was frankly told chemotherapy wouldn’t help. Therefore she was given a very poor prognosis, seven months to a year on the odd side. That was in November of ‘75. As you can figure yourself, that’ll be six years next month and she was not supposed to be here at this time. She started the Gerson Therapy five years ago this very weekend. It’s an anniversary for her too. Here she is, Mary Lee.  [Applause]  Mary Lee: I would like to make one serious point. When you are going to approach a nutritional program and wish to have doctor supervision, I’m going to tell you very briefly about an experience of mine. You need to be careful because doctors may not know what healing looks like, what’s going on. I’d been on therapy 13 months and thank goodness I had Charlotte Gerson and a wonderful doctor named Dr. Walters who knew what healing looked like. I’d had a chest x-ray taken prior to Gerson Therapy, four months after being on Gerson, seven months and 13. An oncologist took a look at these films, took his measuring stick, measured across and said, “Mary Lee, can’t you see you’re still dying?” I’m sharing that with you because I had the privilege of taking those films and taking them to someone who knew what healing looked like. I wasn’t dying at all. That was my body’s intelligence, the calcification around the active tumor. Keep faith. Keep hope. Keep your eyes on the mark. Believe in what you’re doing and the good therapy. You all can be well. Thank you.  [Applause]  Charlotte: Thank you, Mary Lee. Mary Lee brought up a very important point. Generally"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #13 - Bonus 6 orthodox physicians have not seen metastasized lung cancer or most metastasize cancers heal. They do not know what it looks like. They cannot accurately and correctly interpret, in many cases, what they’re looking at. So it’s very dangerous for our patients that are recovering to listen to the orthodox opinions because they are as likely as not, even the best-meaning brothers or doctors in the family, uncles, spouses, sons, in the family, may not be able to correctly interpret healing, which they haven’t seen with their methods. Now we have a very special gentleman who has an extra page, a whole story to himself, in the healing journal because he is so very special. I’d like to introduce Earl Taylor.  [Applause]  Earl Taylor is now 85. When he was 70, alone, a widower, his wife had passed away, he had reached the stage with prostate cancer orthodox treatment where the cancer had spread to a large lump in his groin. The doctors told him frankly, “Go on home and settle your affairs. This is it.” But he wasn’t ready to go. He was a fighter and determined. He found Dr. Gerson’s book and on his own, alone, at home without any help from anybody, put himself on this therapy. That is not easy. Earl did not have a fancy education. He had a hard time following the book. He had to study hard to learn and understand what to do. But he did that. He was in pain. He had tough times, difficult days. How long was it Earl? I think you said it was one month when you went back to the doctor and the doctor could no longer find the mass on the side of his groin. Was that right? One month? Earl: In the beginning I had a doctor who could feel the mass in the groin. I said, “Doctor, do you feel anything?” He said, “Yes.” So later on, a few months later, I asked the doctor, “Doctor, give me your hand.” I took his hand and I put it on where the mass was. I says, “You feel anything?” He said, “No. It’s gone.” Charlotte: Great. Then Earl went on. He didn’t stop there. He carried on the therapy so that he stayed well. It’s now about 15 years. But, as he was recovering, he had an acquaintance, a chiropractor by the name of Dr. Dunbar in Kentucky. He had just been diagnosed with x-rays and so on, bronchioscopy, to have inoperable lung cancer in all lung fields, something like Mary Lee. It had spread in all areas. He was also given up. He called Earl and said, “Earl, would you help me?” Earl said, “Yes, I will help.” He went on over and since he was already experienced with the therapy, he set up the therapy also for his friend Dr. Dunbar. Now Dr. Dunbar had been diagnosed in August of, what year was that? It must have been about 15 years ago. He told me two months later he had new x-ray films made and the radiologist said, “There must be a mistake here. These are not the same lungs.” He very carefully compared all the marks and markings and you can’t mistake lungs. He admitted yes they were the same lungs and there was nothing in those"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #13 - Bonus 7 lungs anymore. They were healed. So Earl, with his understanding of the Gerson Therapy and the book, was able to help a man with incurable lung cancer get well and survive. He knew more than most doctors about healing cancer. A special thank you to Earl.  [Applause]  There was another point and I’d like to bring this out especially. Very often orthodox doctors cannot believe some of these incredible healings. They say, “Well, it’s anecdotal evidence. How do you know?” But in this case we do know. About a little over a year and a half ago Earl, by bending over the edge of a chair, cracked a rib. He had pain and he went to the hospital. The doctor said, “Well, of course now his prostate cancer has spread to the bones and it’s probably all over.” They did a bone scan on him to show that the cancer had spread. But it hadn’t. The bone scan showed completely clear. There was one break in the rib. He put himself back on the Gerson Therapy for a few weeks, the pain disappeared, the rib healed. Here he is, still working part-time at 85. That’s healing. Thank you, Earl.  [Applause]  Charlotte: We have some really remarkable cases here this afternoon. We also have Ed Braun. Ed Braun was my father’s patient. You can read about him. He’s case number 11 in the cancer therapy book, page 16. Ed is case number 11 “A Cancer Therapy.” In your little program booklet he’s on page 16 on the bottom left. Interestingly enough, ten years approximately after exposure to atomic radiation at Los Alamos, he developed cancer in the testicles. He was biopsied and it showed an embryonal cell carcinoma. So they removed one and they gave him radiation. Now of course I leave it up to you to judge what sense there is in radiating somebody when the very cancer they have was caused by radiation. It doesn’t seem very sound judgment to me. Well, it didn’t help. The cancer spread. Where did it go next? Ed: The cancer spread throughout my abdomen. At the time they took out the one testicle it was also a radical removal of lymph nodes up one side and around my back. It came back within six months, in my abdomen. Gradually these metastases settled in the lungs, which is a favorite spot to settle because it’s a blind in, no out. At the time in March of 1956 I had, I think they counted 14 metastasized spots in one lung. They were going to do surgery on it. In fact, I was in the surgery room all ready for surgery and the day went on and they never operated because at the last minute they found spots in the other lung. So that was the point they said, “That’s it.” That was when I heard about Dr. Gerson. Charlotte: In the meantime you had had a total of how much radiation?"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #13 - Bonus 8 Ed: 88. Charlotte: 88 deep treatments. At that time one of the most expensive radiation treatments anybody had had, very severely burned. These radiation treatments do not heal. They damage the body. So you went to see Dr. Gerson. What did he say? Ed: I don’t remember the exact words but he talked to me and went [tisk tisk]. He says, “I think we can help you,” with his German accent. And he did. Charlotte: All right. Ed said in another interview that that was the first optimistic word that he had heard in quite a long time. “We think we can help you.” How long did it take then until it showed some improvement? Ed: Dr. Gerson had this clinic at Manuet, upstate New York. I was there four weeks. I had a lot of optimism as I was there because I saw people getting better. After four weeks I had a chest x-rays taken, it might have been five weeks, but anyway, it showed that the one lung had already, the one that came last which had four small spots, they were gone. Some were leaving on the other one. Later it took a period of perhaps six months for all the spots to disappear and it took another two or three or more years for all the scar tissue to disappear. Charlotte: The scar tissue, of course, being caused by the radiation. It’s always much more difficult to eliminate the radiation damage than the cancer. So here is Ed, working now. He is well and he is active and he is normal, 28 years after he was supposed to be dead. Thanks for coming Ed. He comes all the way from Racine, Wisconsin.  [Applause]  As I mentioned earlier, when I see these people I cannot help but think of my father’s hands and healing mind and spirit, reaching out beyond the grave to keep these people in good health and activity with their families. And free of suffering, free of pain, free of disease and good, active, normal health. We have another young lady here. Where’s Jeannie? All the way back there. Come on front, Jeannie. Jeannie wished to not be further identified. We have gone along with her wish. Jeannie was diagnosed with lupus. As you know, lupus happens to hit young women more than others, young men. It can also quite readily be a fatal disease. With Jeannie it started in April 1979 and she was put on cortisone treatment and she experienced a brief response but then the lupus continued to flare up more and more aggressively. She tried cortisone cream on the lupus lesions, with little results. She started on the Gerson Therapy, at home, on her own, with her family’s help. Her husband helped. What I mean though is without doctors or medical supervision. As you know, all of this is very difficult"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #13 - Bonus 9 and the doctors make it virtually impossible to use nontoxic metabolic treatments. So there is not easily a doctor available. With her family’s help, her husband’s help, she started the Gerson Therapy. Tell us now how you’re doing, Jeannie. Jeannie: I’m doing really well now. I’m teaching physical fitness in Ojai. It’s a very strenuous kind of career because I’m always dancing and teaching yoga and driving back and forth, because I work in different places. What I wanted to tell you, beyond the fact that I feel so good now -- I’m 31 and the truth is that I feel the same kind of energy that I felt when I was 18 or 19, as though I was really given a second wind in terms of life. For this I’m deeply grateful to Dr. Gerson and his loving daughter. What is very important in my case is that my husband was the only one to help me. I come from a family where just about every one of my uncles is a doctor. It just so happens to be. I’d like you to know that not one of my uncles has even read the book, in all this time, even though I started the therapy in October of ‘79. My uncle who is a skin doctor, a dermatologist, told my mother, when my mother was so excited to see that I had this new life, he said, “I heal lupus all the time.” What he meant by that is that they give you the cortisone treatments and sometimes you respond. Sometimes you don’t but it’s an iffy kind of thing and you’re never really cured that way. My tribute to Charlotte is that I really, really was alone and not really, because whenever I called Charlotte, whether it was late at night, early in the morning, it was always a friend who could help with the tiniest little question. It gave me the confidence to go through with what I had to do. Thank you, Charlotte.  [Applause]  Charlotte: Thank you, Jeannie. Before we go to the next patient, I’d like to make a special presentation here. This is our lovely young friend. What’s your name? Jeremy: Jeremy Rands. Charlotte: Jeremy Rands. Where are you from? Jeremy: Canada. British Columbia. Charlotte: He’s here from Canada, British Columbia. I don’t have him in the book because he is not a cured incurable. I’ll tell you in a minute why. He was diagnosed about four months ago with primary liver cancer. At the same time his parents were told that there was nothing anybody could do. He had three enormous tumors on his liver that were biopsied, with a needle biopsy. What did they do? Jeremy: They stuck a needle in it and the one that they did stick the needle in has gone softer like the rest of my tumors but it’s taking a little bit longer."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #13 - Bonus 10 Charlotte: So just a needle biopsy seems to have done some damage and made it harder to heal that tumor. So he was biopsied and there was no question. The family was given a hopeless prognosis. Then the mother asked, “What should we feed him? Is there anything we can do to help him?” The doctor stated, “Food has nothing to do with it. Give him whatever he wants to eat.” He started on the Gerson Therapy, coming to us with a real large whole area of the liver, really sticking out. You didn’t have to undress him you could just see this through his clothes. It was really sticking out. These were hard lumps he could himself feel. He, of course, otherwise was thin and had lost weight. Well, it’s the other way around now. Those lumps are down and they’re virtually no longer palpable. He said even the one in the middle, that was biopsied, is now getting soft, is going away. His liver is getting back to normal. He is gaining weight. He is growing. He is beginning to get rosy cheeks again. He is full of pep and energy. He is healing. He is not yet cured. After four months you cannot talk a cure. But he is giving all the signs and his tumors are disappearing and we are quite confident that he’ll be perfectly well. What do you think? Jeremy: I will. Thank you.  [Applause]  Charlotte: He is a very unusual little fellow. His parents can’t be with him all the time. He’s virtually alone at the clinic. He takes his own juices, his own enemas. He really takes care of himself. He has taken very good responsibility for himself. He’s very remarkable. We are very proud of him. He’s ten years old.  [Applause]  Now, at the other end of the age spectrum we have another liver cancer. On the bottom of page three, to the right, you’ll find the story of Della Robbins. In 1974 she was jaundiced. She went to the hospital in Portland, Oregon where tests and liver scans and biopsies showed cancer. In January of ‘75 she was given three to five weeks to live. Her weight went down to 67 pounds and she was sent home in severe pain. She was heavily drugged in a semi-coma. Her family helped her. There was no clinic at that time. Her family helped her with the Gerson Therapy. They were aware. They had seen others in the family recover on the Gerson Therapy. They helped her with the therapy and in three months she was able to leave her bed, she was off drugs, she had no more pain. You are back to your normal weight. Della: A little bit heavier."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #13 - Bonus 11 Charlotte: A little bit heavier, okay. When I called her to invite her to come and be with us here, do you know where I found her? On a Sunday I found her working in her daughter’s business. She is working, she is active. She travels. She has good energy. She’s normal. She returned to a normal, active life. So what difference does age make? How old are you now Della? Della: 81. Charlotte: 81. Do you want to say something? Della: I owe it all to Dr. Gerson’s book, which we followed, which I feel I can never repay. Charlotte: Thank you very much. Della came down from Eugene, Oregon. You see we have people from all over the United States and even Canada. We have another charming, lovely lady. We are going back now to lupus. That’s Julie Clinwood [?]. Come on up Julie. Where are you at, do you know? Towards the end. Let’s see if we can find you. There she is. She’s on the bottom of page 18. Come on up here with me. You’re 35 now? Julie: Yes. Charlotte: In October of 1979 she had sore joints. By November she was on large amounts of Motrin and Indocin, with no relief. Every joint in her body was swollen and painful. She couldn’t dial even a push-button telephone. She could hardly swallow. She was hospitalized ten days and was on 30 aspirins and that made her worse. By Christmas she had an appointment at the Mayo Clinic and systemic lupus was diagnosed at the Mayo Clinic. They stated that there was nothing they could do. They didn’t even give you Prednisone. Julie: One of the other doctors suggested it but I didn’t want to go that route. Charlotte: You didn’t want to take it. Julie: I felt that Prednisone had as many side effects as lupus did. Charlotte: In a way, of course, that’s fortunate. Prednisone does have side effects and is very damaging to the body. It is harder to heal patients when they have been on Prednisone then if they have not been given drugs. We have a much easier time. So they said there was nothing she could do and they warned her against a quack diet. Julie: When I asked them if it mattered what I ate their only reply was, “Don’t try any"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #13 - Bonus 12 quack diets.” They told me that food had nothing to do with what was wrong with me. Charlotte: She started on the Gerson Therapy in January of 1980. She said she improved from the first day on. After one month she could go shopping, after three months she could drive a car and care for her home. She’s now in good condition. The doctor gave her a clean bill of health and said she was in clinical remission, without drugs of course. You want to tell us a little bit about it? Julie: When I started the Gerson Therapy the very first day I was in less pain than I had been the day before on 30 aspirins plus Indocin at night. To be truthful, when I heard about the Gerson Therapy and I heard why it worked, the fact that the body could heal itself was the first thing that made sense to e when I was trying to get better. That’s why I went on the diet. Charlotte: Thank you very much.  [Applause]  Julie and her husband came down from Minnesota. Here again we have travelers. We have another lady here. Where’s Hildegard? Would you like to come up front? Hildegard was a particularly interesting case and taught us an important lesson. Where is your picture? She’s on page ten at the bottom left. Hildegard is a registered nurse. She’s now 53. Hildegard: Yes. Charlotte: We got her age right, wow. She came to us with a malignant, inoperable thymoma the size of a grapefruit. Her thymus gland was malignant. She was diagnosed with chest surgery and of course a biopsy was taken. That was what year? Hildegard: 1977. Charlotte: It was inoperable because it was attached to the mediastinum and the heart, the aorta, the trachea and the sternum. It was biopsied and she was given 5,000 rads of cobalt to the thymus. After three weeks of this cobalt. She became violently ill. She had burning in the esophagus. She also developed pericarditis and drawing, and her right upper lung collapsed. She had fluid in the pericardium. It was withdrawn. Later both of her shoulders became nearly immovable. She was just about bedfast. Fluid was taken from the heart and she was in bed. She had edema in her legs and throughout her body. A liver scan in 1977 showed spots also on her liver. They suggested 5FU chemotherapy, one of the most toxic kinds. She refused. You must have know a little something about 5 FU. What did you know about it?"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #13 - Bonus 13 Hildegard: I knew it was very toxic and I’d seen patients who had received it for a long time. I knew that it would be fatal for me. Charlotte: Okay. In February of 1979 she came to the Gerson Clinic in Mexico, which is just about six miles south of Tijuana. To this day our doctor, whenever this lady doctor sees Hildegard in such great shape our doctor shakes her head because our own doctor there, when she got a good look and examination of Hildegard, she told Hildegard and her husband that we didn’t think we could help, that she should go home, that she was even beyond our reach. But Hildegard was stubborn. She has a good, stubborn German streak in her. She said, “No, I want to stay. I want to get well.” We said, “Well, we’ll try.” She stayed and she is here, almost three years later. This summer she was visiting in Germany, on vacation, and she says she took hikes 20 and 30 kilometers a day. She’s full of energy. She hikes, she walks, she does anything she wants to do. She’s mostly off the therapy except, of course, she continues eating good food, lots of fresh, raw salads and things like that. She is in excellent condition. In a way we are still a little bit ashamed that we thought we couldn’t make it and we almost sent her home.  [applause]  Hildegard: I would like to relate to you that this therapy went completely with my personality. When I was given this method of working with myself, and I read the Gerson book -- this was in Illinois. I had no contact with Charlotte. I immediately knew, understood rationally, what I needed to do. That fell into place in my mind. I was very happy that this interesting thing was given to me to work with. It was extremely interesting, extremely enjoyable, the way I could work with my body in this fashion and the way I could feel that after some time I was really growing well. That was a true experience for me. It was scientific. I understood every step I took. All the supplements I understood. I understood the rationale of potassium and sodium. I understood the rationale of the enemas. And on the basis of understanding and understanding what is needed for health, I healed, through this therapy. So I was grateful that there had been one person who had formulated this to this extent, that knowledge which has been with us ever since we had come into existence. So I thank you for listening to this today.  [Applause]  Charlotte: Thank you very much. You see now that your next speaker on program is Jackie Davidson. A number of you already know her book and have read about how she helped herself with malignant melanoma all over her body. But before she goes into that I’d like to take up, on the last statement here of Hildegard’s. It is interesting, of course, that the whole idea of healing is not new. It seems that when some of the Dead Sea Scrolls were found and pieced together and"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #13 - Bonus 14 translated, the wisdom of the Essenes was available to us. Among some of the Essene teachers of healing, as far as I understand it from a good deal of research, Jesus spent the 18 lost years, from the time he was 12 till he was 30, he was a great healer. He learned some of the healing with the Essenes. We have a translation of some of these Dead Sea Scrolls. This is not part of the Bible. In this Dead Sea Scroll translation of the wisdom of the Essene you can see and read Jesus describing how to take an enema. It was not my father’s idea. It is not a new idea. Jesus mentions how to eat, says to eat fresh foods, largely raw foods, not to eat meat. Jesus states, interestingly enough, that the body has certain healing reactions that as part of the healing sometimes there’s fever, weakness, dizziness - exactly the same healing reactions we still have today when the patients first start the Gerson Therapy. This is true. Healing is not new. But it was lost as an art and was supplanted with drugging and poisoning and burning and mutilating. The true healing is nature’s own way and is brought out in detail in the wisdom of the Essenes. We have a little booklet at our table, as you leave the hall to your left. It’s called “The Essene Gospel of Peace.” The knowledge of the Essenes. It only costs a dollar. I recommend it because it really is fascinating. The knowledge and information they had, it is not new.

Charlotte: And of course, this is now, the day of the 100 th birthday of Dr. Gerson. I’m particularly happy to be here, to be able to celebrate. I’d also like to point out that we have several items on our book table which are special items in celebration, including the lovely set of octaves prepared by Dr. Juliana Diego, a very famous Italian poet who lives and works in England, writes beautiful poetry in English too. It is in English, of course. I’d like you to have a look at it and perhaps take it home for inspiration and information, both. There are other little items that have been prepared and that are available. We are all here with the idea of celebration today. Let us now get on to business because we are running a little bit late. I’d like to present, again, some of these lovely people who we call cured incurables. You see, again, some very young faces here. It’s sometimes hard to believe that these young people are already in such serious situations. I will cover some of those problems later in my presentation, my speech that will follow this presentation and I think you’ll find it rather interesting. Let’s start with these very lovely young ladies sitting over here on my left. Do you want to come up? They are identical twins. They don’t look quite identical but close enough so that they pass, and of course, they are. They’re Mary and Martha. I want to show you, you’ll find their story on page three, near the top. They have a disease I frankly have never heard of, and probably most of you have never heard of. It’s called Takayasu’s arteritis. Not arthritis, arteritis. The arteries are involved. It’s also known more simply as the pulse-less disease. It started with Mary over here, in October 1978. She was 16. She had infection, flu, diarrhea, severe headaches, pain on breathing, extreme chest pain and her sedimentation rate was rising. Dr. Dunsk [?] could not find a blood pressure or pulse in her right arm. The blockage, the damage, apparently scar tissue had built up in the aortic arch so that there was not enough blood supplying her body. So she was diagnosed as Takayasu’s arteritis. In February of ‘79 at the Mayo Clinic she was again confirmed to have that problem. She was given Prednisone and Dr. Rowan"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #14 - Bonus 2 Johnson, who is a diplomat of the American Board of Internal Medicine stated that, “This is a uniformly malignant and fatal arteritis.” A few months later twin Martha develop the same symptoms and was similarly diagnosed. Now, when we call it malignant that does not mean it’s cancer. It means it’s very seriously damaging to the body and it cannot be reversed according to orthodox methods and it results in fatal consequences. How long did they say it might take? Mary: About a year and a half. Charlotte: They said about a year and a half. The parents were not satisfied with the Prednisone therapy and this rather dim prospect and they started Mary on the Gerson Therapy in June of 1980. Martha started later, since she was also diagnosed later, in August of ‘80. Now both girls are improving considerably with the metabolic therapy, including adjustment, herbs and sedimentation rate is getting toward normal. It’s not yet 100 percent. We are presenting these girls not yet 100 percent cured, but making extremely good progress, off their Prednisone. You’re off it now? Completely. Good. Off the Prednisone. Functioning much more closely to normal. I had the good word yesterday that they are back engaging in sports. Now you know, when you can’t breathe and you don’t have a pulse, you can’t engage in sports. Now what have you been doing lately? Mary: We’ve been horseback riding and taking a couple of evening college courses. This summer we were waterskiing a few times and really having a blast. Charlotte: Good. Do you have any pain anywhere? The headaches or any of these problems that you had? Mary: Just once in a while when I get really exhausted and I overdo, which is my fault. Charlotte: How about you, Martha? Martha: Rarely. The same, just when I’m exhausted. When I’m not taking care of myself is when I hurt. Otherwise I’m doing fine. Charlotte: Doing fine. The doctors also confirmed that there is improvement and that the pulse is improving, the sedimentation rate and all the problems, the arterial noises, all that is improved? Mary: One of the doctors at the Rockefeller University in New York, we were talking to him a couple weeks ago and he was really pleased that we were doing so well. He said, “I don’t understand it but I’m really glad that you are doing so well.” "},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #14 - Bonus 3  [Applause]  I just want to say too that since we’ve been off the Prednisone we’re doing a lot better than when we were on it. Charlotte: Thank you very much.  [Applause]  Mary and Martha are coming all the way from New Jersey to be here with us because it is such an unusual situation. I will be coming back to that, as I said, during my speech in the next period because this is a very interesting basic problem. Okay, who else are some of the people that are leaving? Okay. Let’s have Gary Heaton. Gary Heaton you will find also in your book on the last page, page 22. Gary started to have problems and was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1973. He had numbness in his hands and arms. He had a hypersensitivity to pain. He had constant deterioration until by March 1977 he had some loss of control and he had double vision, occasional falling. He couldn’t walk a straight line or feel his feet. The doctors told him that he would probably land in a wheelchair and he should learn to live with it, which many people are being told that. I tell you, “Don’t learn to live with it. Learn what to do about it to get well.” Now Gary went on the Gerson Therapy and he was first encouraged when the tinglings replaces the numbness. It took quite some time for him to get fairly good improvement because he was working fulltime and doing the therapy, all by himself. We do not encourage that kind of thing. It’s a tremendous stress and load because it’s like having two fulltime jobs. But he did this whole thing and you can see he walks well. He still has some slight numbness in his right hand. It never recovered completely. Now you do want to remember that multiple sclerosis is a disease of the nervous system and there is the chance that the nervous system, when some parts of the central nervous system are affected, that that does not come fully back. But most of his other functions are back. He says he can button his shirt again, tie his shoes again and he has generally very few problems. How are you doing? Gary: It seems to be so far back I’ve forgotten all the bad things that it was like. It makes it very nice to be back here now. It got so nice I went out and got married. I’m very happy now.  [Applause]  It’s like starting life all over again, thanks to you."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #14 - Bonus 4 Charlotte: That’s what we are interested in, getting these people back to a good, normal life. But aside from that first Gary started to go back on skateboarding and then he went back to skiing. Do you still ski? Gary: Yes. Charlotte: Then he went back to motorcycle riding-- Gary: No, no. Charlotte: No more now. Your wife won’t let you. [Laughs] Thank you for coming, Gary. We sure appreciate your coming. Gary: Thank you. I really owe a lot to a lot of you. I really do, an awful lot. Charlotte: Thanks a lot. Okay.  [Applause]  You will see, in this book, a few people...Like right here on this page, the bottom two people, Mr. Crawford Compton and Jeannie Magnason, who did not come. Crawford Compton, you can read his story, is 82 and he’s never flown in his life. He lives in New Jersey and he wasn’t going to come because he just didn’t want to start going on airplanes. Jeannie Magnason, on the other hand, her husband is a farmer and they are in the midst of harvesting season and they were just too busy. So they couldn’t come. I’m saying this to show you that they are busy, active people. Mr. Compton, at 82, is still running his real estate business. They are busy. They are engaged in normal life activities. They are not crippled, they are not damaged, they function. We have a few more people here now. Page 16. Eldon Cinnamon came on here from Canada. Where do you live? Eldon: Near Edmonton. Charlotte: Near Edmonton. It’s tough up there to do the therapy, isn’t it? Eldon: It’s a little difficult and quite expensive. Charlotte: A little difficult and quite expensive. We are very much aware of this problem. In certain areas where there are long, cold winters it’s hard to get the fresh greens, organically grown. Sometimes they have to be flown in and it makes it more expensive. But when you are dealing with cancer, when your life is on the line,"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #14 - Bonus 5 sometimes you just have to do these things to recover. Now, Eldon Cinnamon, you are now-- Eldon: I became 48 the other day. Charlotte: The other day. Can we say Happy Birthday? The 12 th ,it’s a little while back, on Columbus day. Eldon is now 48 and he had metastasized malignant lymphoma in 1975. Nodules in his right groin area were excised and the biopsy was made. It was diagnosed as malignant lymphoma. Lymphangiogram showed peri-aortic glands and those in the groin involved. In other words, it had spread through his body. Also, there was a mass in his abdomen. He had frequent diarrheas, indigestion and hemorrhoids. You see, the body usually has problems, there are other things. When we are using the Gerson Therapy usually all of these things clear up because you cannot heal selectively. If you heal any part of the body you heal the whole body and you eliminate all the problems. Do you still have any of those problems? Eldon: No, I can’t say that I have anything significant. Charlotte: Okay, no more diarrheas, no more hemorrhoids, none of these things? You function well and you feel good, good energy? How are those lumps and masses? Eldon: They’ve diminished but there’s some scar tissue there. Charlotte: There’s some scar tissue left. Well, this we would have to accept and sometimes it takes a little longer. Even the scar tissue often disappears. So we’ll wait a little bit and see. When did you start on the therapy? Eldon: January of 1980. Charlotte: January 1980. So that’s a little bit less than two years. There’s a good chance that that scar tissue will slowly go, if you stick pretty close to the therapy. Are you doing that? Eldon: Yes, very close. Charlotte: Do you have any special words you’d like to say to us? Eldon: I might just say that in early 1980 for the first three or four months when I was on the program, my body began to dump toxins very rapidly and I became very sick. I was in bed, my wife had to take me to the washroom in a wheelchair. My friends that came to see me didn’t say anything then but they said to me later, “We thought we’d be soon called to your funeral.” Now they see me out working with"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #14 - Bonus 6 my boys on the farm and very active, perhaps more energy than most of them. They can’t believe it. So I continually thank the Lord for Dr. Max Gerson, for giving him the wisdom and the encouragement to pursue this program. And also for Charlotte, who we called many times in those difficult days. She never seemed impatient. We talked for long times on the phone and she was always encouraging. We certainly thank her for that.  [Applause]  Charlotte: Thank you. Now we have another lady, over here. Come on up Melva. Maybe you want to stand on this thing. Melva Blackburne, you’re now how old? Melva: 66. Charlotte: 66, okay. We got your age right, too. Melva Blackburne, in one person rolled up, is one of the most amazing, complex situations of diseases all in this one little lady. She is now normal looking. When she came to us she was enormously bloated and tremendously overweight. She had terrible problems. To write up her story took more space than everybody else’s. Page nine on the bottom left. She had constant medical problems from 1940, that’s over 40 years now. She started with kidney disease and many operations. Every time you talk to this lady and chat with her a little while, it comes out that she actually had still other problems besides the ones we wrote up. She had constant treatment until 1979 when she started the Gerson Therapy. She had heart and coronary disease and was on drugs for those problems. She had whiplash in 1964 and she did not respond to treatment so she had pain. She had diabetes and was on drugs for the diabetes. Of course, that doesn’t go away with the drugs. On medication for diabetes since 1965. Are you on insulin or any medication now? Melva: No. Charlotte: She had poor control, that is nerve neuropathy, of her legs and feet, and she had Cushing’s Syndrome. I am not diagnosing. We did not diagnose her. She came with medical reports, yea thick. She was diagnosed by a bunch of orthodox doctors, hospitals, and we have all these medical confirmed diagnoses. This is nothing we are making up. As a matter of fact, in a television program that ran in Australia the other day, she was also presented as a recovering patient and the hatchet man that you heard Peter Chowka speak of yesterday, of the American Medical Association, said, “There’s no such thing. This is a bunch of lies. She couldn’t have had Alzheimer’s. I would personally hand the Nobel Prize to anybody who had Alzheimer’s.” She had it and I am hereby claiming from Dr. Victor Herbert, the Nobel Prize. [Applause and laughter]"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #14 - Bonus 7 She was a confirmed case of Alzheimer’s disease, which is premature old age. She wasn’t functioning. She had all these problems. She was falling and she wasn’t concentrating and all of these things. She also had fatigue, weakness, osteoporosis. She had arthritis in every joint, including her ears. She had susceptibility to infection, pneumonia at least twice a year. She had an enlarged liver. Arthritis, attacks, anxiety, confusion, aphasia, it goes on and on. I’m not making this up. As a matter of fact, I have to read it because I can’t remember all these problems. She was on drugs for years and had many, many surgeries. She started the Gerson Therapy in October of 1979, which is just two years ago. She feels fine now. She is off all the drugs. When she went back to her doctor about a year later and told the doctor she was off all the drugs he said, “You’re out of your mind. You’ll die in a month. This is terrible.” The doctor called her daughter and said, “Make your mother go back to the drugs. She’s crazy. She has to have the drugs.” Of course she did not go back to the drugs. Melva: I changed doctors.  [Applause]  Melva: I did go to the medical doctors for check-ups and glucose blood tests for my diabetes. They say I’m fine. Charlotte: Good. Thanks so very much for coming. Melva: Thank you, Charlotte, and your father for saving my life. Charlotte: Thank you very much.  [Applause]  Anybody else who has to leave? Okay, Bill. What page is Bill on? Bill: Number one, two. Charlotte: Number one, two. Of course, you should be. Bill Gerdis [?] is also a very interesting patient. Oh, he’s on three. The second one from the top. Bill, you are now 85. Bill Gerdis was a patient of Dr. Gerson’s, way back in 1940 or ‘41, he doesn’t even remember exactly which year it was. It was a long time ago. He, in 1941, had x-rays from New York Presbyterian Medical Center which showed his spine fused from neck to coccyx, top to bottom, with rheumatoid arthritis. You know there’s no cure for rheumatoid arthritis, not by orthodox medicine. The doctor’s said they could do nothing. Also, he had bleeding stomach ulcers. He"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #14 - Bonus 8 started the Gerson Therapy in October of ‘41 and the ulcers were gone after about six weeks. He went back to light work after about seven and a half months and he went into heavy work after 14 months when he took up a construction business. Bill: Steel construction. Charlotte: Steel construction. That’s not light work. At this time he is alive and well. I met him first dancing at Eric Goodman‘s victory party, swinging the ladies. He travels, he has fun, he is enjoying life. Would you believe he is 85? Bill: It’s only a number. 85, 82, that don’t mean a darn thing. It all depends how you feel. I take care of myself. I’m happy. I enjoy life. It is up to each individual how he treats his body. They put a lot of things on to make their selves look beautiful, clean themselves, take a bath. But the inside is the main thing of how a person feels. I don’t eat no junk food. I’m not on a diet either. But I live the way a human being should live and I feel good. I thank Dr. Gerson and my wife for bringing me back. Thank you. Charlotte: Thank you for coming, Bill. He comes from the Bay area. Norman: Is that everybody that is going to have to leave early this afternoon and couldn’t be at the afternoon program? We have another surprise or two, including a 91 year old that’s going to be up here, if we can get her. Is she chickening out? Charlotte: No, she has a little bit of a problem. A lady, 91 years old, is in the audience. She was my father’s patient for infections and problems. She, like many others, remains in good health and activity. She came alone from Akron, Ohio just to be here with us. She is coming just to show you what she looks like and you wouldn’t believe she is 91.  [Applause]  Irene: When I had this infection in my kidney I went on a fast. I went to a doctor and he wanted to give me a lot of dope. I wouldn’t take it. I went on a fast for ten days and I got a fever and it was very bad. My family said, “If you don’t go to a doctor we’re putting you in an ambulance and taking you to the hospital.” I was in Akron, Ohio. I said, “The only doctor I’ll go to is Dr. Max Gerson in New York.” They got him on the phone and he very lovingly said, “Bring her.” I have had fabulous contact with him before through a housekeeper that I had for 26 years who had a breast removed at Cancer Memorial Hospital. So that is how I became in touch with Dr. Gerson. I can’t tell you the fabulous things that happened prior to my going to New York for my kidney condition. When I was helped into his office he looked at me and"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #14 - Bonus 9 he said, “Mrs. Harrison, you look to be 150 years old. What have you done to yourself?” I said, “I feel 150 years old.” He said, “We’re going to do something about it.” And he did. I was six weeks at his wonderful little place in New York. I met fabulous people who were cured of cancer and I kept their records. I took them, later, to the chief of staff of the cancer operating, of the surgeons in Cancer Memorial Hospital who told me that there was nothing that could be done to get an honest evaluation of Dr. Gerson’s work because Dr. Rose, the head of the research department knew that if they allowed Dr. Gerson to come in and prove that he was curing cancer, that Dr. Rose would lose his job as head of the research department. He said, “I’m sorry to tell you, the medical association is not organized for the benefit of the people of this nation, for their protection. It is organized to protect the economic situation of the doctor and the protection of the doctor from difficulties that might arise when they don’t cure their patients.” This is why it is organized, for the protection of the medics. I shouldn’t be taking all this time, but it was so exciting. He later wrote a letter for me to give to a doctor in Akron, Ohio, saying that if cancer hit his family he would go to Dr. Max Gerson. I think with that we’ll stop. I feel just like all the rest of them, indebted beyond any ability to pay our debt to these wonderful people. Their courage.  [Applause]  Norman: I don’t think we got his lady introduced. She introduced herself as Mrs. Harrison. This is Irene Harrison. She’s not on the page because we didn’t know her until last week or so. Charlotte: When she received this journal she called up, she said she was coming. She packed up within a day and here she is, all the way from Akron, Ohio. Thank you. Some of the patients that you have not yet seen we will present later on this afternoon but now we have to get on with the program. Norman: Yes, we’re sorry we have to break. We’re running late now. We’re back in say 25 minutes, if you can. Charlotte: I do have to say, in great distress, that John Ash bloom [?] who I was going to present to you, who was case number 13 in my father’s book, who was here the rest of the time, you may remember the man who’s arm was missing, has left. To my knowledge, I didn’t expect him to leave. I was going to present him but he’s gone. He had metastasized melanoma. He had had his arm removed 26 years ago. It had gone into his lungs. He was coughing and he was dying when he came to my father. He was here but he had to leave and I didn’t know about it. So I can no"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #14 - Bonus 10 longer show him to you. But I have a picture of him here, on page four, toward the bottom. You’re going to have to remember that he was here. He had a beard, which is not showing on the picture. We probably have him on the TV tape. So we’ll have to move along to Eric Goodman. Eric Goodman is a very special friend. I’m going to have to move along fairly fast at this point. Eric discovered cancer in his jaw. It was biopsied, found to be adenocarcinoma. He had earlier had a little skin cancer removed and the doctor said, “That’s nothing. It’s gone and there’s no problem.” That’s not true. If there’s cancer anywhere in the body it’s a problem. Anyway, he had it removed and a few years later, six or seven years later, he now had adenocarcinoma, biopsied, in his jaw. The doctor said, “We’ll remove the jaw, the palette, and then we’ll give you radiation and the whole works.” Then he said, “Un-uh.” He had seen his sister die that way. He didn’t want it. He also had heart fibrillation and arthritis. He also had sinus trouble and headaches since he was a teenager. He also severe sleeplessness and couldn’t sleep nights. He had total lack of energy. He couldn’t work during the day. And he had hemorrhoids. He started the therapy, I remember it exactly, on August 1 st 1975. He started on the Gerson Therapy. He had some problems, like everybody else, going through healing reactions. But he is now recovered. A couple of years ago when his daughter got married his surgeon told him, “Listen Eric, it’s too late now for an operation. There’s nothing I can operate on. It’s gone.” Tell me what else your surgeon is doing now. Eric: Originally two very eminent surgeons gave me, one was from University of San Francisco and the other one at Kaiser Hospital, gave me six months to live and if I do not follow their goodies the cancer will either go to my brain, one said, or to the lungs, the other said. So I told them, exactly the same, what Geraldine told her doctor when she was hospitalized. “Don’t you touch me!” The only one I would have let touch me was Charlotte. Charlotte: And it’s only in a loving touch. Eric: After he examined me for six years, my mouth, ears, throat and couldn’t find anything, he himself went on a modified Gerson diet.  [Applause]  Charlotte: Thank you, Eric. Right below Eric on page three on the bottom, near the bottom, is Chris Matteson. Chris Matteson, who is now 31, he had ulcerative colitis and he was diagnosed in 1974, after proctoscopy and colonoscopy. He was given sulfadine and Prednisone. The latter caused gaining weight, acne, acne on his back and a moon face and facial redness. His doctor said that diet makes no"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #14 - Bonus 11 difference. He was on 60 milligrams of Prednisone and the doctor urged removal of the colon. Remember, they take the whole colon out and they put a sack on you. It’s a terrible thing, not only psychologically, a rubber bag on your belly, but if you don’t have a colon you have very serious problems. Anyway, he refused and he started the Gerson Therapy in June of ‘79. You were bleeding at that time and had colitis and the moon face and other problems. In five months he was back to work. What are you doing now? Eric: Still working. Charlotte: Feeling better? Eric: Yes, very good. Charlotte: Any problems with your colon? Eric: No, none at all. I’m doing very good. I’m very healthy and haven’t had any problems since. Charlotte: Are you on any drugs? Eric: No drugs. And I hope never again either. Just one thing I’d like to say, which I don’t think Charlotte knows about. My wife and I have been married for eight years and we’ve had trouble with infertility. After I’d gone to the clinic and started the Gerson Therapy, about a year ago, we found out my wife was pregnant and last June we had a nice, big boy. Charlotte: That’s wonderful. Thank you.  [Applause]  Now these are the success stories and the side effects of the Gerson Therapy. You want to be careful, you could get pregnant. You will hear, in a little bit, also from George Gimson [?], who also had that problem and with the Gerson Therapy it was eliminated. George Gimson was Dr. Gerson’s patient. Way back he was discharged from the army, toward the end of World War II. He had had cancer growing--where’s your picture, George? At the bottom of page six. That’s my father’s picture. Where did you get that, George? George: The second thief is the best thief. Charlotte: Ah-ha. I don’t know. His picture’s on the bottom of page six. He had this pimple on the back of his neck. They removed it but it came back and it was cancer. He"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #14 - Bonus 12 entered the army anyway. It was basal cell carcinoma. He had surgery, it was removed, behind the right mastoid and in April of ‘45 a large lump recurred at the right mastoid. Fitzsimmon’s Hospital x-ray treatments were impossible because of the proximity to the brain. Besides, he refused it when he saw his good friend, who he had just shaved that morning, they were sent down to radiation and he came back a few hours later, dead. Cobalt. So he refused it. He was sent home without treatment in October of ‘45, to die. He was in severe pain. He had a large tumor on the outside as well as going into the brain. You can see the x-rays in the book. He is described as case number 35 in “A Cancer Therapy.” He went to Dr. Gerson with his eye closed, in severe pain, his whole face screwed up. He was helped because he was almost unable to walk. He started on the Gerson Therapy. He was on it for some three years and then he went back to work. At work, instead of doing his longshoreman’s work that he had been doing, he was house painting and he got a lead poisoning. In order to get over the lead poisoning he stayed on the therapy another two years. I’d like to point out that the therapy works in this respect similarly to homeopathy or similar to chelation. It removes heavy metals or other toxins from the body. So he is completely free and clear and remains in good condition. George is one of these people that I’m sometimes worried about and have nightmares about. When they get off the therapy and they are well and their bodies function well, George, right now, smells of a cigarette he smoked. He carries a pack of cigarettes. He smokes against. He eats most anything he pleases. He remains well. George also, you will find his story, he was interviewed, he was one of the five patients that my father showed before a Senate committee in 1946, before Senate [indecipherable] committee as the first doctor that ever presented terminal cancer patients. George was one of them and you can read his story in the little book on our table called “Has Dr. Max Garson a True Cancer Cure?” George: And my wife also had two children. Charlotte: And you also weren’t supposed to have children? George: Couldn’t do it for nine years and then went to Dr. Gerson and he fixes it up. What else happened was the sister-in-law, she had a tumor in the womb, Gerson says, “Go home with your brother-in-law and stay there until you’re better.” She got pregnant. Do you know where the son is today? He’s out here in California. His name is Jackie Vanore. He’s a doctor. How do you like that for a pineapple? Charlotte: We’ll send him back. [Laughter] George: Keep the Gerson Therapy out of your mind or your wife will get pregnant again. "},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #14 - Bonus 13 Woman: I brought you something George for all that badness. George: This is to kill that nicotine flavor. Charlotte: The green juice, to make up for the badness. All right, now we have, still on page three on the left-hand bottom, we have Alison Roberts. Alison, where are you? There you are. We have such lovely young women here. It’s always a little bit of a shock to me that even these young people have cancer. Alison is now 30? Alison: 36. Charlotte: Oh, it says 36. It’s a little bit dark here. Okay. She had a recurring lymphocytic lymphoma. In September of ‘79 a lump on her neck the size of a lemon. She had surgery and the biopsy showed lymphocytic lymphoma. Chemotherapy was recommended but refused. In January of 1980 another lump, at the time one centimeter by one was in the same area. Chemotherapy was again recommended and refused again. In April of 1980 she had lumps up to four by four centimeters. She started the Gerson Therapy. By August the tumor became softer and smaller. Now, this one took a long time to dissolve. I remember her calling sometimes rather panicky, the tumor was still the same, it hadn’t gone down, it was still sitting there. It wasn’t growing? Alison: No, but it was swelling. Charlotte: There would be up and downs, swelling. But up and down isn’t cancer. Anyway, after August then the tumor became softer and smaller. After six months the tumor was gone. After one and a half years she’s in good condition. Are you feeling good? Alison: Great. I recently had a complete physical by a well-known internist who said my blood was textbook perfect, that I’m more normal than normal.  [Applause]  Charlotte: I’d like to re-stress, this is important, these people get re-examinations because orthodox doctors will say, “Oh, well they never had cancer or it’s just anecdotal evidence. They say they are well but they still have cancer.” But you see, they have been re-examined. They have been rechecked. Like Bill for instance, he had another scan and he was showing clear. Earl Taylor had a scan and showed clear. So we have these cases that are fully documented. They are not anecdotal evidence. They are documented from the beginning, not our biopsies. They are documented when they are well, full recheck. They are fine. It is not anecdotal evidence."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #14 - Bonus 14 Now we’ll go a little bit here in order. On top of page four we have Katy McPherson. There she is. Also Hodgkin’s, lymphosarcoma. In January of ‘79 she had a large mass. It was discovered in five days testing at San Diego Sharp Hospital. Again, not ours. Surgery confirmed Hodgkin’s lymphoma. In other words, you had a biopsy. The tumor had penetrated the large artery and was inoperable. A large artery, which one? Katy: The main one. Charlotte: The aorta? Katy: Yes. Charlotte: Okay. It was inoperable. But they removed the spleen just the same while they were inside there. You didn’t need it, did you? Katy: It was very much enlarged. Charlotte: Oh, it was enlarged. Katy: The pancreas was malignant and had thrown off the cancer cells which had filled the spleen till it was as far up as it could go. It was like a fat sausage. Charlotte: So they removed the spleen. The tumors had also invaded other abdominal organs. Radiation and chemotherapy were suggested and refused. She tried the megavitamin therapy and by September new tumors were growing on the abdominal wall. She started the Gerson Therapy in September of ‘79. Five months later there were no signs of cancer anywhere in her body. What were these recent tests you had in June of ‘81. Katy: Let me tell you a story before I answer that. The large tumor was originally discovered by my gynecologist routinely. She sent me out to a surgeon. I chose not to stay with him. I was pretty busy getting tests and having surgery and staying alive. I never contacted her again. A year and a half later the phone rang and a voice I didn’t recognize said, “This isn’t Katy, is it?” I said, “Yes.” She said, “You’re not alive and well, are you?” I said, “I think so.” “It couldn’t be!” I said, “Who is this?” It was the doctor who had originally discovered all of this. She said, “I don’t believe it. There is no way you could survive this long. I want you in my office immediately.” Now it takes two months to get an appointment with her but I was there in two days. She checked me over. I was perfect. But she said the lab would show the real truth. Everything was perfect. So every six months she insists that I come in and have tests. "},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #14 - Bonus 15 Charlotte: Thank you very much for coming Katy. That’s beautiful. Katy: I would like to say that there are two magnificent side effects. One is to live in an aging body that doesn’t age too much anymore. I have all the energy and an absolutely pain-free body and I feel totally alive now since I’ve been on the Gerson Therapy. More alive than I ever have been in my life. Thank you and thank your father.  [Applause]  Charlotte: Thank you for coming. We are running a bit late now. I’m going to try to be fast. We have Paul Tyrel [?] It’s a very simple story. Paul Tyrel had prostate cancer, lumps on the prostate were discovered in 1976. Urologists did a biopsy, not us, and confirmed cancer. Operation was recommended and refused. He started the Gerson Therapy at home, on his own. There was no clinic at that time. He had no doctors or hospitals. In March of ‘77 he started the therapy. The last three tests all show negative. What kind of tests were those, Paul? Paul: Those were tests by Dr. Navaro in the Philippines that shows the actual presence of cancer anywhere in the body, not just the prostate cancer. I’d like to say one thing. All during this treatment my wife and I were constantly running into people who said, after we told them what we were doing, “We don’t believe it,” or “We can’t believe it.” We are constantly amazed and constantly marveled at the things that we have seen happen, both to myself and to others we know who are also on this treatment. We have lived it. Charlotte: Thank you very much for coming, Paul.  [Applause]  We have Christine Colmas [?] here. She is page 15 on the right-hand side. Christine in May of 1980 had a series of small seizures. In June she had a severe seizure. She was hospitalized and a brain scan showed a shadow. They did an operation in June of ‘80 which showed an inoperable cancer. They did a biopsy and it turned out to be an astrocytoma. It was so deep and so penetrating that they couldn’t get it. So they just closed her back up and recommended radiation and chemotherapy, which she refused. She started the Gerson Therapy in July of 1980 and she is without any drugs. She rarely ever has any seizures. Once in a long while she has a mild one. What is it now, about two months apart? An occasional rare one. Otherwise she functions fully and completely. She, as you see, has no trouble moving. Her eyes are fine. She has no headaches. She is free and clear. She is recovering. I can’t quite say at this point that she is cured, it’s to short. She is recovering and she shows every sign of being well on the road to complete, total, normal health. Inoperable astrocytoma, cured, healing. Any words on that?"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #14 - Bonus 16 Christine: Thank you for being here Charlotte.  [Applause]  Charlotte: Thank you for coming. We have Marilyn. What page are you on, Marilyn? The bottom of page 17, Marilyn Edwards. Marilyn had a spreading melanoma. In December of 1977 pain and bloating and weariness. In January of ‘78 increased pain. In February a biopsy showed spreading, malignant melanoma. At the City of Hope it was suggested that she have a deep excision, mutilating. She refused. Her biopsy wound never healed. A UCLA doctor urged immediate deep excision as her only possible chance for survival and she refused. She started on laetrile but she went home still in constant pain. She started on the Gerson Therapy in March of ‘78. Within four days the wound was closed and pain disappeared. Marilyn is still struggling occasionally, but overall in good health. How’s things going? Marilyn: I’m fine, thank you. Charlotte: Fine. Marilyn: Belief and determination, I think, is the key, along with the Gerson Therapy. I’m grateful to be a Gerson Person.  [Applause]  Charlotte: Thank you for coming Marilyn. Now we have, since we are on the melanomas, we have another melanoma patient here, Virginia Golden. What page are you on? Page ten. You see, they know what page they are on. Virginia also was my father’s patient, way back in 1946. Virginia: I’m 35 years old. [Laughter] Charlotte: Good. I’m glad you are. You’ll see her story on the bottom of page ten. You can also read the full story in Dr. Gerson’s book “A Cancer Therapy - Results of 50 Cases.” You can see a picture of Virginia’s leg and ankle where she had her first melanoma and operation. It then spread to her thigh. She had another operation. Before that wound was even closed she had a new large mass in her groin and her husband was given a hopeless prognosis. He was told, what? Three months to live. That was in 1946. That’s been a long three months. Virginia: Yes, it has. Charlotte: As you see, not only is Virginia very much alive, looking wonderful, but certainly not showing her age, which I won’t tell you. Virginia teaches music. She was a"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #14 - Bonus 17 singer and she teaches singing. She is active. She had, after the second year of the therapy with being healed of melanoma, she gave birth to a healthy, normal baby girl. Virginia: I’d like to say that the men are not the only ones that can do it. [Laughter and applause] Charlotte: Thank you very much for coming, Virginia. Virginia and her husband came all the way from Birmingham, Alabama. So I want you to know we have lovely people that have made a real effort of being here. Josephine, what page are you on? You don’t know? I’ll have to find you. She had uterine cancer. The bottom of page 17, left. She had excessive uterine bleeding noted in October 1978. A D&C was done on November 17 th . Where was that done? Josephine: University Hospital in Cleveland. Charlotte: University Hospital in Cleveland. Not by us. It showed the tumor was filling the uterus, which was twice its normal size and the biopsy showed cancer growing into the wall of the uterus. The doctor advised immediate operation, hysterectomy. This was just a day or so before Thanksgiving and he said, “Why don’t you go home for Thanksgiving and come back the next day?” At that point she decided she wasn’t going to have the operation. She heard about the Gerson Clinic and she came to Mexico to our clinic instead. The surgeon, when she canceled the appointment, what did he say? Josephine: He told me I wouldn’t be here the following year and that he felt sorry for my husband who would have to watch me die. Charlotte: That wasn’t nice. So she went on the Gerson Therapy instead, no operation. Here she is, very nice, very well and feeling good. Are you in good energy? [audio cuts out] Charlotte: ... a girl, when she had cancer and that’s exactly what happened. When she was seven years old she had a recurring giant-cell carcinoma on her left leg. Ankle was it? On her ankle. The doctors proposed to cut the leg off, not that it would save her life. It would only save her from unbearable pain while she was dying. The parents refused and accidentally found out about Dr. Gerson and the Gerson Therapy. She came to my father’s clinic in Manuet. How long did it take till the pain subsided and the swelling came down? "},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #14 - Bonus 18 Gail: I was at the clinic for a total of two weeks. When I first got there the pressure of a sheet lying on my leg was just too much to bear. At the end of two weeks I could not only put pressure on it but I could walk around and run like a little girl again. Charlotte: Thank you. Now Gail not only has her both legs, as you can see, she is in good health. She is active. She is teaching. She is into political activities, organizing. She does all kinds of things, whatever her spirit directs her to do. She is in good activity and enjoying life. Here’s Gail. She comes all the way from New Jersey, taking a long trip to get here to be with us. Gail: I went on the Gerson treatment and I haven’t had a child, so I feel somewhat left out after all those stories back there. It doesn’t happen automatically, I guess. Charlotte: You mean it takes a man too? Gail: Does it? Oh.  [Laughter]  What’s interesting is I met a nurse recently and as I always am prone to do, “Gee, do you know about the Gerson Treatment?” I told her what I’d had and she said, “Obviously you couldn’t have had that.” I said, “I really did. It was documented, etc.” She said, “Well, I’ll settle for it’s been a long remission.” Charlotte: A 25-year remission. We call it a cure. Okay, fair enough? Thank you.  [Applause]  We have another gentleman up here on stage. He’s not in your book because he came here on his own. We didn’t even ask him specifically to come. But he’s here. I want to talk about him.

He’s just going through a reaction.” Charlotte: When was it that you started the Gerson Therapy? Luis: June of ‘79. Charlotte: In June of ‘79. So that’s a little over two years now, going on two and a half years. Luis: That’s correct. Charlotte: And you’re feeling good? All these lumps and everything disappeared? Luis: I feel fine. Charlotte: Any pain anywhere?"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #14 - Bonus 20 Luis: No pain. Charlotte: Are you on any drugs for the diabetes? Luis: No drugs. Charlotte: No pain, no drugs. Feeling good. Thank you. Luis: To sum it all up, lots of determination in combination with the Gerson Therapy I’m still running.  [Applause]  Charlotte: Thank you very much. Now we’re running over and I think somebody is going to get me and I’m afraid we have to quit at this time. I think we have gone and presented all the patients that were here. Anybody we haven’t talked to? I think we have presented everybody and I’ll pass it along to Norman. Norman: All right. We’re moving along now. We’re going to have another fundraising effort, like we did yesterday. I want to repeat that everything that we’re able to do is primarily through the support of you people. If we have no support then we can’t do very much. As you surely realize, we put quite a bit into this convention. So we’re hoping to be able to continue our efforts and put on other conventions. This is a part of the videotaping that we hope to be able to support people who want to help us away from here. Of course we have the audio tapes, the video tapes and all of our research programs and so on. Now, if you people, like you did yesterday, would help us by...Let’s see. Pardon me just a minute. We have one other thing here. Here she comes. Just in time. Mary Lee: Just in time. For those of you who weren’t here yesterday morning when I had an opportunity to share some of my experience with you, today is my five-year Gerson anniversary. You can applaud. I will too.  [Applause]  Six years ago I was told I only had six to eight months to live and the application of this therapy and a lot of tenacity, it does work. What I also have the privilege of doing today is to play some music for you on the piano while this fundraising is going on. I’ve been playing the organ at church for about 20 years so I’m used to playing for offerings, but in this situation a gift to the Gerson Institute to further the education so that others might survive and learn how to do it in a better way is even a greater privilege."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"The Gerson Tapes #14 - Bonus 21 I want you to know that while I was ill I stopped playing. There wasn’t any life- force in me, there wasn’t any creativity and very little strength. So as I play for you today, and the vitality has returned, it’s another blessing and another statement of how wonderful it is to be able to become well again. Yesterday Charlotte talked about the Essene Gospel of Peace and talking about the words of Jesus, as far as taking enemas and proper foods, diet, nutrition. The pieces that I’ll be playing for you today, the first one is entitled, “What a Friend.” The rest of that states, “What a friend we have in Jesus.” The second piece is simply called “Happiness” and that’s just full of joy. The third piece, I’ll continue one into the other, is called “My Tribute to God be the Glory.” It’s words I wish I’d written because they can come from my heart. They say, “How can I say thanks for the things that you’ve given me? Things so undeserved that you came and proved your love for me. The voices of a million angels could not express my gratitude. All that I am and ever hope to be, I owe it all to thee. To God be the glory.” I hope you enjoy it.  [Applause]  Norman: I’d like to make one comment, Mary Lee. A part of our disappointment sometimes is that people call us in the very late stages and we say that we wish we could help you but with all that chemotherapy or something we feel frankly that there just isn’t much chance and we can’t ask you to spend your money if we don’t feel that we’re able to help you. There are many other people, like Mary Lee and a lot of these people up here, who one way or another heard about it, sometimes through a friend, but our purpose is to get the word out and not just to one or two but to hundreds of thousands because there are over a thousand a day dying and most of them have not heard of the things they can do to save themselves. That’s what we’re here for and we hope that you’re here for too. Thank you.  [Piano Music]  Announcer: Thanks for listening to this audio.
