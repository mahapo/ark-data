Drinking the juices of raw fruits and vegetables as a path to good health was even touted in the early nineteenth century. While juicing itself isn’t new, what is new is the machine that can render even the hardest beet into a sweet juice to sip in a matter of sec- onds. This ability is increasingly important as our society quantifies the amounts of these foods we should be eating. Some governmental agen- cies say five daily servings of vegetables and three of fruit, while other medical groups advocate seven vegetables and two fruits. Regardless of exact number, it’s a lot. That’s where the benefits of juicing begin. An 8-ounce glass of juice can fulfill a third of your daily needs. It’s like the difference in medicine between injections and pills. The benefits of the injection go directly into your bloodstream, while a pill must dissolve and be absorbed, which increases the time between when you take it and when you begin to feel the results. The same is true when juicing because it allows the body to quickly absorb high-quality nutrition, which leads to increased energy levels. So drinking fresh juices is an excellent health habit. It’s more than an excellent source of vitamins, minerals, enzymes, purified water, pro- teins, carbohydrates, and chlorophyll. In liquid form, juices supply nutrition that is not wasted on creating its own digestion, as is the case when eating whole fruits or juices with a large percentage of pulp. Here are some of the benefits that come from juicing: u Juicing creates fast assimilation of nutrients. Some enzymes, vitamins, and minerals are “trapped” in the indigestible fiber of vegetables and fruits and can take up to a few hours to be assimi- lated into the body. When these nutrients are added as a pure juice, the time is reduced to 15 minutes, which allows the body to rest. u Juicing keeps up our water table. Our cells consist mostly of water, which is essential to their proper function. That’s why we"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Juicing xiv should consume at least 8 glasses of water a day. Beverages such as coffee, soft drinks, and alcohol actually draw water from our bodies to metabolize. Raw juices, on the other hand, supply the water we need to replenish lost fluid. And the water is puri- fied better than from any bottle. Juices also promote our bodies’ natural alkalinity, which is important for immune systems and metabolic functions to work properly. u Juices deliver natural sugar. The natural sugars in fruits and vegetables deliver the same energy as from soft drinks but without chemicals or fat. You might be wondering why I’m asking you to buy an expensive machine rather than just pour from a bottle. There’s an important reason: only fresh juices that haven’t been pasteurized to increase their stability contain necessary enzymes and other “living” ingredients. Plants are the spark plugs that keep our bodies running. They get their energy from the sun during photosynthesis. These “living” quali- ties comprise enzymes, vitamins, and minerals. Minerals are basic parts of the earth’s crust, and plants get them from the soil while enzymes and vitamins are produced in plants’ tissues. But cooking and processing destroy these nutrients. Enter juicing as a way to get the maximum benefit. Cooking accounts for the loss of almost all the water-soluble vitamins (A, E, D, and K) from food. And even allowing raw vegetables to sit after peeling reduces their level of nutrients. For example, cantaloupes lose 35 percent of their vitamin C if slices sit overnight in the refrigerator. So drinking a juice right after it’s extracted gives you the best of all possible worlds. How This Book Is Organized The book is divided into four parts: Part 1, “Component Parts,” teaches you the fundamentals of juicing. The first chapter details how to select a juicer, how to use your blender, and the difference between juicing and pulping. In the next two chapters you’ll find profiles of fruits and vegetables frequently"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"xv specified in recipes, along with their nutritional highlights and the amount of juice that comes from them. Part 1 ends with a chapter detailing information on nutritional supplements you can add to juices, herbs you can use to flavor them, and ways to use your juice machine as a kitchen tool. Part 2, “Garden Patch Purées,” gives you combinations that use just about all the vegetables in the produce aisle. The recipes are divided by both the types of vegetables they contain and if any addi- tional ingredients are added into the flavor profile. In one chapter juices are made primarily from root vegetables, and the next showcases the cabbage and its cousins. The rest of the chapters in Part 2 are for juices complexly flavored with herbs, based on popular cold soups, or balancing fruits with the vegetables. Part 3, “Fruity and Fantastic,” shows you that often the whole is better than the sum of its parts. Juice is almost synonymous with fruit, and these recipes multiply the ways you can combine these luscious juices. The recipes in Part 3 are divided by the nature of the predomi- nant fruit in the juice blend. They range from tropical treats to bowls full of bright berries. Part 4, “Lean and Luscious Libations,” demonstrates that juices can be fun as well as serious. These juices are meant for parties, either as punches or as cocktails. The recipes in the first chapter of Part 4 are all flavored teas. Some use herbal teas while others encompass many species of prized black tea. In the last chapter of Part 4, you’ll see some sort of alcohol listed amongst the ingredients, but instructions are given on how to concoct the juices to remain “unleaded.” At the end you’ll find some useful appendixes. A glossary will add to your knowledge of foods, and an appendix of charts will help you convert measurements to the metric system. The last appendix is a chart listing the nutritional composition of the fruits and vegetables frequently used in these recipes. Extras In every chapter you’ll find boxes that give you extra information that is either helpful, interesting, or both.

Nutritional Necessities Every health organization—including the American Cancer Society, the National Cancer Institute, and the National Research Council—believes Americans don’t eat enough fresh fruits and vegetables to prevent disease. And cooking and processing destroys food’s natural nutrients and energy, so you’re not getting as many benefits from eating the food if you cook it. But juicing preserves all those nutrients. 1 Cha pter"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Part 1: Component Parts 4 Vitamins for Vitality To remain healthy, humans need to consume some 13 vitamins a day. The largest group of these vitamins is the eight distinct B vitamins and also vitamin C, which are all water soluble. This means that with the exception of vitamin B12, which is stored in the liver, you need to eat foods that contain these vitamins on a daily basis because they don’t stick around. You know many of these vitamins in the B family by their chemical names, such as thiamine (B1), niacin (B3), and folic acid (B9). The body stores the fat- soluble vitamins, which is both good and bad. On the good side, you can go for a day or so with- out meeting your quota and your body will still function well. But on the bad side, too much of a fat-soluble vitamin can lead to toxicity. Magic from Minerals Dietary minerals are the group of nutrients that bind us to all living organisms. Plants need them to prosper and grow and so do humans. The mineral content of food depends on the soil in which it’s planted. Soil is the natural breakdown of the minerals in the rocks that form the earth, and some soils are richer in some minerals than others. Nutrients are elements or compounds that our bodies need for metabolism, growth, or other functioning. Carbohydrates, proteins, and fats are the three substances that provide energy in our diets, while vitamins, minerals, and water are the essential nutrients that support metabolism. All of these come from the foods we eat. Liquid Lingo Casimar Funk, a Polish chemist in the early 1900s, set out to research diseases like rickets and scurvy. He discovered that these widespread maladies were due to chemical deficien- cies rather than poisons in the diet. He named these chemical compounds vitamins , or literally “union of vitality.” Pulp Tidbits"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Chapter 1: Just Juicing 5 The trace minerals include chromium, cobalt, copper, fluorine, iodine, iron, and magnesium. Of these, the body needs iodine in the largest quantity, which is why table salt frequently has iodine added as a dietary supplement. Dietary minerals are the chemical elements required by all living organisms. They can either be bulk minerals our bodies require in large amounts or trace minerals that we only need a small amount of in our diets to keep us healthy. Liquid Lingo Essential Enzymes Enzymes are the body’s worker bees because they are constantly demolishing and rebuilding our bodies. Approximately 1,000 enzymes are found in all living things, including raw food. It’s the enzymes in fruits and vegetables that cause them to ripen. Enzymes are paired with the foods they help to break down. For example, bananas are high in carbohydrates and contain amylase which is a carbohydrate-splitting enzyme. Butter is high in saturated fat and contains lipase, an enzyme that splits fat. Juicy Jive Amino Acids Next to water, protein is the most plentiful element in the body, and more than 50 percent of the dry weight of the body is composed of protein. Proteins, in turn, are composed of protein chains called amino acids. These amino acids are the raw materials with which the enzymes do their building. The essential amino acids are those that the body can gain only from the foods we eat. A deficiency in an amino acid can create a range of symptoms from allergies to poor digestion. For example: u Lysine helps to activate hormones and enzymes, as well as pro- mote body growth and blood circulation."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Part 1: Component Parts 6 u Leucine keeps us awake and alert. It’s sort of nature’s own jolt of caffeine. u Tryptophan is essential for building blood, skin, and hair. It also calms the nerves and stimulates digestion. u Phenylalanine is what gives the thyroid gland a boost in the pro- duction of thyroxin for our mental balance. u Threonine stimulates easy digestion and general body metabo- lism. u Valine activates the brain, helps in muscle coordination, and calms the nerves. u Methionine helps cleanse both the liver and kidneys and regenerate their cells. The need for nutrients and in- creasing their number in your diet is the “why” of juicing. Now it’s time to get to the “how” of juicing. Passion for Pulping Let’s say you don’t want to invest in a juicer when you already have a blender and perhaps a food processor. Well, don’t despair. You can still gain lots of beneficial food energy with a process called pulping. This process works the same as juicing, but if you want to drink the mixture without the pulp, you will need to strain the resulting liquid. Fundamentals of Fiber Vegetables and fruits are full of two different types of fiber, and fiber is necessary in the diet. That’s why if you’re using a juicer, you have to remain aware of how much fiber you’ve had in the course of a day from other sources, such as whole grains, nuts, and seeds. Did you ever wonder why you’re always so mellow after Thanksgiving dinner? Sure, you ate a lot of food. But one of those foods was turkey, which contains a high amount of tryptophan. So after your turkey dinner, you’re calm—and full. Pulp Tidbits"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Chapter 1: Just Juicing 7 The first type is insoluble fiber. Water does nothing to its size or form, but it helps to keep stools soft in the intestinal tract and push them through the tract faster. This is the type of fiber found in whole wheat, wheat and corn bran, and potato skins. Then there’s the soluble fiber. Soluble fiber forms a soft gel when it mixes with water in our bodies and is able to bind bile salts which may help in lowering cholesterol. It also keeps the digestive tract func- tioning properly. When a drink is pulped, this beneficial fiber is retained with all the good things from the juice. Prepping Your Parts It would be easy if all you had to do was place the produce in the blender to pulp it. But it’s not that easy. Blenders and food processors don’t separate the juice from the pulp. They create a thick lique- fied mixture by pureéing. So for each recipe, I give you tips on how to prepare the food for pulping as well as juicing. In a juicer the tops of scal- lions will be ejected along with all the other pulp. But for a blender or food processor, you should cut off the tops for aes- thetic reasons. The same holds true for the skin of yams and some fruit skins. Eating large quantities of beans and other legumes can cause poten- tially embarrassing bouts of gas and other forms of flatulence because they contain short-chain carbohydrates that are not digested by the human digestive tract but by natural bacteria in the colon. It’s just nature doing its thing. Pulp Tidbits If you want to peel apples, pears, or bananas for pulping, either do so just before blending them or else toss them with some fresh lemon juice to prevent them from browning. While the browning does not change the flavor, it gives these fruits a most unappealing color. Wrong Spin!"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Part 1: Component Parts 8 Machines with Muscle When you’re thinking about a juicer, don’t picture that little plastic thing you use to squeeze lemon juice. That’s about as close to a real juicer as the Wright brothers’ airplane is to the Space Shuttle. The juicers we’re discussing are powerful machines. They have to be. Their purpose is to separate the liquid from the fiber, and that takes power. Consider how hard it would be to squeeze the juice from a beet using the little plastic thing you use for lemons. Choosing Your Weapon When selecting a juicer, it’s most important to choose one with a stable motor and low heat generation. Excess heat will instantly kill out enzymes. The stability of the machine as it’s doing its appointed task is more important than the number of rpms (revolutions per minute) it boasts. The more efficiently the unit can shred and eject pulp, the less the possibility that the juicer will clog or overheat. Juicers fall into the following categories: u Masticating: Food is squeezed through gears that crush it and force it through a fine strainer. Pulp is continuously extracted, and nutrients are preserved because the machine doesn’t generate heat or friction. u Centrifugal: A spinning basket shreds the food and forces the juice through a fine strainer by centrifugal force. This process adds oxy- gen to the juices and makes them somewhat frothy. Either type works efficiently and is up to the task at hand. You’ll f ind information on how it func- tions on the box. Few stores will allow you to try juicers before purchasing them, but that’s where the Internet enters the picture.

They’ll range in price from about $75 to more than $350. I’m sorry to tell you that powerful motors aren’t cheap. Consider these guidelines when selecting a juicer: u Is it easy to use and clean? In general, I find centrifugal juices are easier to handle than their masticating cousins. u What is the percentage of juice it removes from the pulp? It should be at least 90 percent. u How much juice will it process before you have to empty the con- tainer and the pulp container? If the juice beaker only holds a cup, it slows down the process. u Does it have different speeds for different jobs? Most of the good ones have high and low, with high used for harder foods. u Does it sit securely on the counter? This is a major consideration, as well as whether the feed tube is easy to use at your height. u How noisy is it? Some juicers I tried require earplugs to save your hearing, while others are virtually silent. In general the centrifu- gal juicers are quieter, as are juicers that are more expensive. u Can the parts go into the dishwasher? To me this is a deal breaker. I don’t want any machine that can’t go into my favorite machine. Before rushing out with credit card in hand, spend some time researching your options online. Many companies will give user reviews, and cyber shopping is also a way to find a good deal! Don’t throw away the pulp from the juicer if you’re a gardener or even know one. It makes rich com- post to add into soil once it has broken down, but don’t just put it on top of your flower beds or you’ll be inviting a bug invasion. You can also add the pulp to soups as a thickening agent. Juicy Jive"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Part 1: Component Parts 10 Completing the Equipment List No machine exists in a vacuum.

Blender Basics Chances are you already own a blender, and if you do, then you’re all set both for pulping and for incorporating foods as a second step to juicing. Many recipes in this book specify the use of a blender or food processor as well as a juicer. The primary reason is that foods such as bananas and avocadoes don’t contain enough water to juice correctly. You would end up with virtually no juice or nutrients. The second rea- son is that certain foods such as seasonings don’t juice well, so you’re instructed to either add them via a blender or stir them into the juices by hand."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Chapter 1: Just Juicing 11 Purchase Prowess If you’re buying a new blender, you don’t have to mortgage the house. When blender shopping, look for a blender that has ... u A heavy base to stabilize it on the counter. u A strong motor of 60 hertz or more. This makes it strong enough to chop the hardest vegetable, and it will last far longer than machines with less power. u A glass jar so that it’s dishwasher safe. Some of the most expensive blend- ers have stainless-steel jars. They are the most durable, yes, but you can’t see what’s going on inside. u A two-piece lid that fits very snugly on the jar to avoid leaks. The small access hole in the center of the lid allows you to add ingredients when the machine is running. Operating Instructions A blender might look innocuous enough, but you definitely need to approach this machine with caution. These usage tips will help you get the most from your blender: u Always keep one hand on the top of the lid to ensure it won’t fly off. u Turn off the blender completely and allow the liquid to stop mov- ing before removing the lid. u Never put your hands in the blender jar, and be sure the blades have stopped moving before you insert a spatula into the jar. When you’re blender shopping, consider how easy or inexpensive it would be to replace the jar or purchase a second jar. This could make the difference between two machines at a simi- lar price point. Juicy Jive"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Part 1: Component Parts 12 u Use only rubber spatulas, not metal spoons or knives. u Never fill a blender more than two-thirds full. When the motor moves the liquid around, it will push it above the level of the ingredients at rest. Never fill it too full, or you could have a mess. The Organic Alternative Whenever you have the chance, it’s always best to buy produce that is certified organic. Organic agriculture is about growing foods without synthetic fertilizers and chemical biocides. And it’s also about using agricultural practices that benefit the planet, such as recycling. Each year more than a billion pounds of pesticides and herbicides are used in the United States. About 2 percent actually kill insects, with the remaining 98 percent ending up in the air, water, soil, and food supply. But this is not the case with organic foods. When this method of healthy farming began about 20 years ago, the only way to ensure that food was organic was to purchase it directly from a reputable farmer. Luckily, that’s no longer the case. In 2002 the National Organic Program (NOP) became law. The U.S. Department of Agriculture administers this program, which upholds the prohibitions against chemicals first spelled out in the Organic Food Production Act of 1990. The NOP states that it believes in “optimizing the health and productivity of interdependent com- munities of soil life, plants, ani- mals, and people. Management practices are carefully selected with an intent to restore and then maintain ecological harmony on the farm, its surrounding environ- ment, and ultimately the whole planetary ecosystem.” Wanting to eat organic food is another reason to buy food in sea- son rather than imported. While many European countries also Make buying organic your shopping goal when you’re looking for shelf-stable food as well as fresh. There are now organic options for everything from canned tomatoes and chicken stock to tortilla chips made from organic corn. These are all good choices.

When using produce that is conventional rather than organic, always pay attention to the skin to see if it’s been treated with wax. This is especially true of cucumbers and citrus fruits. While citrus fruits need to be peeled before juicing, cucumbers do not. But if they are waxed, it is necessary to peel them. The Least You Need to Know u Juicing is an effective way of delivering nutrients to our bodies. u Pulping uses the same ingredients as juicing but leaves in the fiber because pulped drinks are made in a blender. u Juicers remove the juice from the pulp either by centrifugal force or through mastication. u Organic produce is the best to use at all times because it’s not sub- jected to chemicals."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Fruits for All Seasons In This Chapter u Fruits to juice u Juice yields u Tips for freezing fruit Fruit and juice are synonymous to most people. If you only drink one glass of juice a day, chances are it’s a fruit juice in the morn- ing. In this chapter, I’ll give you a guide to the fruits that I most often use in the recipes in this book. You’ll learn how to tell if fruits are ripe and ready for juicing and how to freeze ripe fruit for future treats. You’ll also get some handy knowledge about how much juice you’ll get from various fruits. This is useful if you’re using juices for these recipes that someone else has squeezed. Nature’s Energy Fruits contain both complex carbohydrates and simple sugars. The complex carbohydrates are more slowly digested, which keeps your energy level up. 2 Cha pter"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Part 1: Component Parts 16 The simple sugars are in a form called fructose. In contrast to com- plex carbohydrates, fructose gives you instant energy when you drink the juice, but it also gives you nutrients you won’t get from the “empty calories” from refined sugar. The Fruit Family What unites fruit botanically as a group is that it has a seed or many seeds. That’s why tomatoes, eggplant, and avocadoes are technically fruits. But because we eat them as vegetables and with other vegetables, w e’ll discuss them in Chapter 3. The majority of this chapter gives you profiles of different fruits. At the end of the discussion of some fruits, I tell you how much juice you might expect to extract. So if you want to use a high-quality bottled juice, you’ll know the equivalents. Apples. Although not as high in vitamins as some other fruits, apples do contain a high level of pectin, which helps reduce cholesterol. Y ield: 8 ounces of juice per pound of apples. Apricots. High in beta-carotene, which the body converts to vita- min A, pale ripe apricots are also a good source of fiber and potassium. A ripe apricot is soft when gently pressed, and the skin is thin enough that it does not have to be peeled. Just slice the apricot and discard the pit. Yield: 6 ounces of juice per pound of apricots. Bananas. Bananas are an easy way to get a juice with a creamy texture without adding cream—or any binder for that matter. They are a fantastic source of potas- sium, an electrolyte lost during exercise, as well as an excellent source of magnesium and vitamin B6. Bananas are truly ripe when the peels are mottled with brown spots, not just bright yellow. Yield: 2 ounces of juice per pound of bananas. Bananas should not be pushed through your juicer. Because they don’t contain very much juice, you won’t have the luscious texture they bring to juices when they’re added in a blender.

Blackberries, rich, purple-black in color and high in heart-healthy compounds called saponins, are actually a cluster of tiny fruits, each with its own seed. They’re most common and affordable during the summer and can be successfully frozen after a quick rinse and gentle patting with paper towels. Yield: 4 ounces of juice per pound of blackberries. Blueberries. In addition to antioxidant vitamins, blueberries are high in salicylate, a compound that reduces inflammation. Look for berries that are plump, not shriveled, and have a slight grayish patina. Rinse them, discard any stems, twigs, or small green berries, and they’re ready to go. You can use blueberries fresh, or dry them on paper towels and freeze them in a plastic bag. Yield: 3 ounces of juice per pound of blueberries. Cantaloupes. Cantaloupes are rich in beta-carotene, vitamin C, and potassium. The rind should appear well netted. To tell if it was picked ripe, look at the stem end. It should be a full scar, without flesh attached, showing that it was picked when mature. Cantaloupe can be a carrier of salmonella, so wash the rind with soap and water before peel- ing it. Yield: 8 ounces of juice per pound of cantaloupe. Cranberries. It’s not a wives’ tale: cranberries, high in vitamin C, do alleviate bladder infections because they pre- vent bacteria from attaching to the wall of the bladder. Select plump, non-shriveled cranber- ries and rinse them in a colan- der. It’s difficult to find fresh cranberries except in the fall, so buy a few extra bags when you can find them, and freeze them for use during the year by rins- ing them and placing them in plastic bags. Yield: 4 ounces of juice per pound of cranberries. Because it can be quite acidic, most bottled cranberry juice is either sweetened with corn syrup or other sweeteners or blended with apple or grape juices (often with less cranberry than the other juice). If you want real cranberry flavor, look for smaller brands and in health food stores to find the real thing. Wrong Spin!"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Part 1: Component Parts 18 Cherries. Rich in potassium and B vitamins, sweet cherries come in a range of colors and all make great juices. Discard the stems, rinse the cherries in a colander, cut them in half and discard the pits, and they’re ready to go. Yield: 6 to 8 ounces per pound of cherries. Grapes. Both green and red grapes are high in potassium, and their flavor is almost identical. Which one you choose depends on your aesthetic preference and which seems the sweetest. Rinse and remove grapes from the stems; then dry on paper towels. Yield: 8 ounces per pound of grapes. Honeydews. A good source of both potassium and vitamin C, choose honeydews that are green, not white, and slightly perfumed. Cut honeydew melons into quar- ters, and then cut away the soft flesh from the hard peel. Since the fruit is being pushed through a juicer, how pretty it looks is irrel- evant. Yield: 6 ounces of juice per pound of honeydew melon. Kiwi . Kiwi are a rich source of vitamin C, and their potassium level is almost as high as that of bananas. They contain both vita- min A and E, and their fuzzy skin can be used as a meat tenderizer in the same way as papaya skin. When juicing, it’s not necessary to peel the kiwi, and the skin con- tains some valuable antioxidants. But when pulping, do peel them. Yield: 4 ounces of juice per pound of kiwi. Mangoes. Like other orange-fleshed fruits, mangoes are a good choice for beta-carotene. Mangoes are ripe if they’re slightly soft when pressed and the skin is mottled with red and orange. Avoid buying There are approximately 8,000 varieties of grapes, many of which date back to prehistoric times. The main classifications we now follow are the differ- ence between wine grapes, which are high in acid, and table grapes, which are sweet. Thomas Jefferson was the first person to try to raise wine grapes in the United States. Pulp Tidbits Melons are the juiciest of fruits, and some of the juice can be lost when you’re peeling them. Always handle melons over a mixing bowl to catch the sweet juice. Then strain the juice and toss it into the beaker with the juice coming out of your machine.

Mangoes have a hard way and an easy way of being peeled, which varies fruit to fruit. If you’re having problems cutting away the skin, try peeling it from the other end. The stone (pit) is ellipti- cal, and once you’ve determined its shape, cut a parallel slit on both sides to remove as much flesh as possible; then cut off any flesh remain- ing on the stone. Juicy Jive Nectarines. See Peaches. Oranges. Oranges are a superb source of vitamin C. For juicing, it’s only necessary to peel an orange. The white pith will be ejected with the other pulp. When placing them in a blender, the best way to prepare oranges is to cut off the top and bottom so the orange will sit snugly on the work surface. Then use a serrated fruit knife to cut off the peel, including the white pith. Cut between the white lines that mark the sections, and the orange sections, sans peel, will pop right out. Yield: 8 ounces of juice per pound of oranges. Papayas. Nutritionally, the papaya is best known as a source of the enzyme papain. Buy papa- yas somewhat soft and golden orange. If the fruit is hard, cut a small slice off both ends, then make a few lengthwise cuts into the flesh. The papaya will ripen in a few days at room tempera- ture. Always peel the papaya and discard the peppery seeds before cubing it. Yield: 1 to 3 ounces of juice per pound of papaya. Peaches. Peaches, high in beta-carotene, are ripe if they’re soft when pressed gently. There’s no reason to peel peaches before push- ing them through the juicer; however, you might want to peel them if Papain is an enzyme that can ease indigestion and has been shown to protect the stomach from ulcers. It is also a tenderizer, so save papaya skins and toss them into a meat marinade to speed along tenderizing meats.

If so, drop them into boiling water for 30 seconds, remove and drain lightly, and the skins will slip right off when you rub the fruit. Yield: 1 to 3 ounces of juice per pound of peaches. Pears. Fiber-rich pears are a good source of vitamin C and potassium. Pears ripen better off the tree, and it might take up to a week for them to ripen if they’re rock-hard when you buy them. You can substitute any variety of pear for another. Yield: 4 to 6 ounces of juice per pound of pears. Pineapples. Pineapples are a good source of minerals, including potassium, calcium, iron, and iodine. Choose one that is fragrant and plump with an overall golden color, or allow it to sit at room tempera- ture until it meets that description. Slice off the top and bottom so it sits flat on your work surface. Then, with a strong knife, slice off the peel. It’s not necessary to remove the tough core when juicing or pulp- ing pineapples. Yield: 6 ounces of juice per pound of pineapple. Plums. Rich in antioxidant vitamin C, all the hundreds of species of plums are good in juices if they’re ripe. A plum is ripe if it’s soft when you gently press it with your finger. Just rinse plums before slicing them, and discard the pit. Peeling is not necessary. Yield: 4 ounces of juice per pound of plums. Raspberries. Vitamin C is the big boast of succulent raspberries, which are now grown in a rainbow of colors, from classic red to golden amber. When choosing fresh raspberries, look at the bottom of the container, and choose one that has the least amount of juice, a sign that There are two basic types of peaches, cling- stone and freestone. They taste similar, and the only difference is whether or not the flesh clings to the pit. Both make an excellent juice, and regard- less of which you pick, choose the ripest peach you can find.

Place berries in a bowl of water, stir them around to dislodge any lingering dirt, and then gently pat them dry on paper towels. Yield: 4 to 5 ounces of juice per pound of raspberries. Strawberries. A good source of iron as well as B vita- mins and vitamin C, strawber- ries do not ripen once they’ve been picked, so what you buy is what you get. Because most companies “top dress” the pack- ages with the “hero berries” on the top, check out the bot- tom of the package. Generally, the smaller the berry, the more intense the flavor. Tiny European fraises du bois are the sweetest of all. Yield: 4 to 5 ounces of juice per pound of strawberries. Watermelons. Watermelon is rich in electrolytes, which makes it a good choice for a snack after a strenuous workout or any other time you might be dehydrated. One of the great feats of genetic engineer- ing is the seedless watermelon. They’re not as much fun because you can’t spit the seeds at your friends, but they’re much easier to transform into a juice. It’s easier to cut the flesh off the rind after cutting a watermelon in quarters than it is to cut through the rock- hard rind. It’s not necessary to remove the seeds when juicing, but it is important if pulping watermelon. The best idea is Raspberries were a campaign issue in a presidential election. Because they were consid- ered quite the luxury, in 1840 the Whigs attacked Martin Van Buren for “wallowing lasciviously in raspberries.” Pulp Tidbits Fraises du bois literally means “strawberries of the woods” in French, and you can find these tiny treats in specialty produce markets, most often in the spring.

But in small quan- tities their tartness creates a yin-yang with sweeter fruits and accentu- ates the other fruits’ flavors. When choosing lemons and limes, look for ones with thin skins because they’ll have more juice. The yield for both fruit is 4 ounces of juice per pound. Fresh from the Freezer Modern air transportation has given us a new definition of “airline food,” and we can now enjoy almost all fruits year-round thanks to air freight from other countries. But we do pay a price for this conve- nience, so for juicing, it’s also possible to take advantage of dry-packed frozen fruits. If you stock up on fruits when they are either in season locally or attractively priced and then freeze them yourself, you’ll save money plus have a freezer stocked. Do keep in mind that you lose some of the nutrients when fruit is frozen, but many remain intact. The best way to freeze fruit is to first prepare the fruit by clean- ing, slicing, peeling, sectioning, etc. as appropriate. Then simply arrange 1 ⁄ 2 - to 1-inch pieces on a baking sheet, cover with plas- tic wrap, and put them into the freezer until they’re frozen. Once frozen, transfer the fruit to a heavy, resealable plastic bag. Mark the date on the bag, and use the fruit within two months. Dry-packed frozen fruits are frozen in individual pieces without any syrup or addi- tional sugar. You’ll find the fruits in plastic bags in the freezer section of your supermarket.

We’ve come a long way, and we now appreciate how nutrient-rich vegetable juices can add to our general health. In this chapter I give listings of vegetables that are frequently juiced. Each contains the nutritional highlights of the vegetable, along with how to select it and store it. 3 Cha pter"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Part 1: Component Parts 26 Successful Shopping Shopping for vegetables is much easier than shopping for fruit. Vege- tables don’t need to ripen to gain greatness. In fact, it’s just the oppo- site. Vegetables should be eaten as soon as possible after they’re picked. In an ideal world, we’d pick vegetables from the garden outside the kitchen door and enjoy them within minutes. But we know that’s a bit unrealistic and probably wouldn’t offer enough variety. It’s best to buy vegetables at least two or three times a week, and always try to use up what’s in the refrigerator before replenish- ing them. In the listings I talk about how long vegetables can be stored, but especially with organic vegetables that are not subjected to waxing and other forms of preservation, it’s always best to deplete your supply quickly. From Asparagus to Zucchini Unlike fruits, vegetables have no common denominator other than they somehow came from the earth. Some grow above ground, while others grow below. Here’s a guide to vegetables frequently pushed through the juicer: Asparagus. Asparagus, a good source of vitamins A and B1 as well as folic acid, is actually a member of the lily family. The young shoot is the edible part, and while most of our asparagus is green, it can also be white or purple. When choosing asparagus, look for straight firm stalks with tightly closed buds. The stem end should still be firm because it dries out as it ages. In the early spring, buy very thin asparagus, but the fatter stalks will have more flavor in May and June. Asparagus begins to lose flavor as soon as it is picked, but it can be stored up to three days. Wrap the stems in a damp paper towel. For juicing, all you have Always rinse all produce just before juicing it or cooking it. Water can cause any leafy vegetable or herb to rot or mold more quickly than if it’s stored dry. Juicy Jive"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Chapter 3: Versatile Veggies 27 to do is rinse the spears and cut them into 2-inch lengths, but for cook- ing it’s generally desirable to break off the woody stems and peel the bottom few inches of the stalks. Yield: 6 ounces of juice per pound of asparagus. Avocado. Avocado is a great source of potassium, and is also high in vitamins A, C, and E. These buttery members of the pear family are so perishable that they’re always shipped to stores when rock hard. Look for avocadoes that are heavy for their size, and avoid any with soft or dark spots. An avocado is ripe when it yields slightly when pressed at the stem end, and to speed ripening you can put the fruit in a brown paper bag in a warm spot. Once ripe, an avocado can be refrigerated for up to five days. Like a banana, avocado should be added to juices in a blender and not put through the juicer. Yield: 2 ounces of juice per pound of avocado. Beets. Beets are a “two-fer” of the vegetable bin. You can juice the prized roots and also the leaves as long as they are perky and not wilted. The roots are a good source of calcium, potassium, and iron, while the greens are rich in calcium, iron, and vitamins A and C. Choose beets that are small to medium in size, and a key to selection is that the greens should be fresh. Beets should always be scrubbed well. After all, they did come out of the dirt! When you get beets home, store beets and greens separately. Use the greens within two days, but refrigerate the beets themselves in a plastic bag for up to two weeks. Yield: 6 to 7 ounces per pound of either beets or beet greens. If you cut open an avo- cado and it’s still unripe, coat the exposed surfaces with mayonnaise, push the avocado back together, and allow it to continue ripening. Juicy Jive Never, ever consume beet juice alone, because it can cause a severe inflammation of the throat and esophagus. No juice should ever be more than 50 percent beet juice. Wrong Spin!"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Part 1: Component Parts 28 Broccoli. Even broccoli’s detractors have to admit that it boasts a strong nutritional profile. A one-cup serving provides the same amount of protein as an equal portion of rice or corn, but with one third of the calories. It’s an excellent source of calcium, as well as being very high in antioxidants and vitamins B6, C, and E. Firm stalks, tightly closed bright green heads, and a fresh aroma are the way to select this mem- ber of the cruciferous family. Avoid broccoli that has a strong cabbage smell, dried or woody stems, and yellowed florets, and use it within four days to preserve its nutrients. Broccoli has a strong flavor if con- sumed by itself as a juice. Always wash broccoli well. Grit and even insects or worms can be hiding in the florets. Yield: 6 ounces of juice per pound of broccoli. Cabbage. There are different types of cabbage, and all are high in vitamin C. Savoy cabbage has wrinkled leaves, while common white cabbage has shiny light green leaves. For both species, select heads that are firm and heavy for their size. Don’t select a head that has discol- ored leaves or feels light, because both are signs it’s been picked for some time. Rinse cabbage well, trim the stem end, and store it in the refrigerator for up to two weeks. Always store it in a plastic bag, because some of its natural aroma can transfer to more deli- cate foods. Yield: 6 ounces of juice per pound of cabbage. Carrots. The color is a tip-off that carrots are high in beta- carotene, but they also are excellent sources of vitamins A, B, and C. On the mineral side, they’re an excellent source of calcium, phospho- rous, potassium, and sodium. It’s good to buy carrots that have the lacy foliage attached as a sign of how fresh they are, but discard the foliage as soon as you get them home. Carrot foliage actually robs the carrots of moisture and vitamins if left attached. Pick carrots that are thin, firm, and smooth, and deeply colored. Avoid any with cracks or if they’ve begun to become soft or wither. Refrigerate carrots for up to a week, but discard them if they begin to show cracks. Yield: 6 to 8 ounces of juice per pound of carrots. While native to Afghani- stan, carrots were known in Europe long before the Christian Era. Both Greeks and Romans wrote about them but actually preferred turnips for eating. Pulp Tidbits"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Chapter 3: Versatile Veggies 29 Cauliflower. Like broccoli, cabbage, and other cruciferous veggies, cauliflower by itself can be rather strong, so always mix it with other vegetables and perhaps some fruits. High in vitamin C, cauliflower should be snowy white with no discoloration on the florets when you buy it. Try to use it within four days, although you can refrigerate it for up to a week. Another thing to look for is that leaves are bright green and fresh-looking. Yield: 6 ounces of juice per pound of cauliflower. Celery. Celery juice is mild in flavor, and its natural sodium con- tent adds to any mixture, so it’s one of the most versatile to juice. Pascal is the type of celery we find in American supermarkets, although other varieties are grown around the world. High in vitamin C and potas- sium, choose celery stalks that are bright green and firm with fresh-looking leaves. Store celery refrigerated for up to a week. Cut off the stem end, separate the ribs, and wash them well. There’s always a large amount of dirt embedded at the stem end. For juicing, all you have to do is rinse it well and cut it into 2-inch lengths. Juice the ribs and the leaves, or leave the leaves on the short sprigs to use as a garnish. Yield: 8 to 10 ounces of juice per pound of celery. Cucumbers. Like celery, the mild taste of cucumbers makes them a foil for more dominant flavors in a juice, and they also pair nicely with herbs. Select cucumbers that are firm, dark green, and have a skin that is slightly bumpy but not wrinkled. Organic cucumbers are never waxed, but should you buy a conventional one, always peel it. Peeling cucum- bers is a shame because the skin contains almost all the valuable vitamin A content as well as the mineral silica, which is good for connective tis- sue and your complexion. Use cucumbers within four days after picking. Yield: 8 ounces of juice per pound of unpeeled cucumbers. There’s a big difference between the natural sodium found in foods like celery and sodium chloride, or table salt. Natural sodium is alkaline so it balances the pH of the blood and makes the body’s use of calcium more effective. Natural sodium makes our blood salty, but it doesn’t raise our blood pressure.

Americans are just beginning to appreciate the wonders of fennel, a vegetable similar to celery with a nutritional profile that is high in sodium, calcium, and magnesium. Its slight mild licorice fla- vor makes a wonderful juice that blends with stronger vegetables and fruits. Fennel is basically a winter vegetable, and it’s at its peak from November to April. Pick fennel bulbs that are about the size of ten- nis balls and show no bruising or discoloration on the skin, store them refrigerated, and use them within five days. For juicing, use both the bulb and stalks, and save the feathery greens for a garnish. Trim off the stem end, rinse the bulb, and cut it into pieces to fit your juicer. Yield: 6 to 8 ounces of juice per pound of fennel. Garlic. This bulbous member of the lily family is a wonder food that has been proven to reduce cholesterol as well as the risk of heart disease. Available year-round, choose heads that are firm and not dry or shriveled, and store them in a cool, dry place. Don’t refrigerate garlic, because it will cause it to sprout. If you see green shoots emerging from the tips of the cloves, don’t buy them; they indicate that it’s old and sprouting. It’s best to store garlic in a cool, dry place and not refrigerate it. Yield: Only used for flavoring, and usually 1 or 2 cloves is sufficient. Ginger. While we refer to ginger as a root, it’s actually a rhizome native to Asia that has a sweet and somewhat peppery flavor. When choosing ginger, look for nodules that are large, firm, and have a shiny skin. Avoid ones that are dull and shriveled. Store it refrigerated for up to a week. It’s not necessary to peel ginger for juicing, so the size of the bulb doesn’t matter, but for general cooking, select large pieces or you’ll peel away the majority. Yield: Only used for flavoring, and most juice recipes call for 2 to 4 tablespoons of sliced ginger. The species of fennel we use for juicing as well as cooking is the Italian strain sometimes referred to as Florence fennel; it’s also just called fresh anise in some super- markets. Juicy Jive A rhizome is different from a root. It’s actually an underground part of the stem that usually grows hori- zontally. Ginger is an edible rhi- zome, but many exist in nature.

Rather than growing as a compact head or with tight florets, it grows like a bou- quet of flowers. It’s very high in iron as well as vitamins A, B, and C. Choose heads with crisp, dark green leaves, and pass by heads that have even a tinge of yellow in the leaves or are limp. Refrigerate it loosely in a plastic bag for up to five days. Kale is easy to juice. Just rinse it well, and break it into lengths that fit into your juicer. Yield: 6 ounces of juice per pound of fennel. Parsnips. These iron-colored vegetables are first cousins of the carrots, and both have an essentially sweet flavor, although the flavor of parsnips is somewhat stronger. Choose large parsnips that are very firm, and look for feathery tops, which you should discard as soon as they arrive home. Like carrots, store parsnips for up to a week. Parsnips are a good source of vitamin C and also contain large amounts of potassium, phosphorous, and silicon. Yield: 4 ounces of juice per pound of parsnips. Peppers, bell. Bell peppers, a good source of vitamin C, are best if they’re allowed to ripen on the vine. That’s why red peppers, which are also high in vitamin A, are so much sweeter than green peppers, which are just immature. When choosing peppers, look for ones that are firm and shiny, and avoid ones that are shriveled. Store refrigerated but not in plastic bags for up to a week. For juicing, remove the cap and pull out the large clump of seeds, although you don’t have to be meticulous about seed removal. Then rinse the pepper, at which time more seeds will fall off, and cut it into pieces to fit your juicer. Yield: 5 to 6 ounces of juice per pound of peppers. Potatoes. Potatoes add a light flavor to juices, and they’re high in vitamin C and several of the B vitamins, as well as potassium. If pulped instead of juiced, they are also a good source of soluble fiber. Choose potatoes that are firm and free from blemishes, discolorations, or sprouting eyes. Yield: 3 ounces of juice per pound of potatoes. Parsnips are sometimes harder to find than ubiquitous carrots, so feel free to substitute carrots for them anytime you’re juicing. Be aware, however, that the color of the juice might not be as pleasing. Juicy Jive"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Part 1: Component Parts 32 Scallions. You’ll notice that scallions, also called green onions, are the member of this offshoot of the lily family I use most often for juices. And the reason is simple. They are the mildest, and their deli- cate flavor blends well with myriad vegetables. They are also about the same size, so you don’t have to “guesstimate” what is small or large. Scallions should be firm with unblemished bulbs and perky green tops, so avoid ones that are limp. Most scallions will start to go limp after three or four days of refrigeration. Yield: 2 ounces of juice per pound of scallions. Spinach. Popeye was right: spinach is a wonder food. It’s a great source of iron, phosphorous, and fiber as well as vitamins A, B, C, E, and K. It’s best to buy loose spinach rather than in bags so you can really see the condition of the leaves, which should be crisp, firm, and dark green. Also choose a bunch with short stems. Store it refrigerated for up to four days. Give spinach a very careful washing, and follow with a second bath if the leaves are very dirty. Spinach doesn’t produce all that much juice when compared to its bulk, so I don’t use it very often, but if you prefer to drink it rather than eat it as a salad, juice away! Yield: 4 ounces of juice per pound of spinach. If you get a potato home and discover that it has a green cast to the flesh, throw it out. The green indicates the presence of solanine, a toxin caused if potatoes are exposed to light when growing. Wrong Spin! Don’t believe those bags that say that vegetables or lettuce has been pre-washed. They might have given you a leg up on the process, but the job’s not done. I’ve done numerous tests and always find lingering dirt. I don’t like to wash tender greens in a salad spinner because it can bruise or break them. For those veg- etables, swish them around in a large bowl of cold water, rubbing stem ends with your fingers. Then remove them from the bowl and pat them dry with paper towels. And look at the amount of grit in the bottom of the bowl from your pre-washed produce! Wrong Spin!"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Chapter 3: Versatile Veggies 33 Tomatoes. Botanists classify tomatoes as a fruit, but I’m list- ing them in the vegetable section because we eat them as a vegetable. Today’s science touts tomatoes for their lycopene content, which is proven to have anti-cancer qualities. In addition, they contain a good amount of vitamin C and potassium. There’s nothing like a vine- ripened tomato fresh from the garden. Second to that, choose ones at the market that don’t have ridges at the stem end, which is a sign the tomato might be mealy, and always choose the brightest red possible. If ripe, refrigerate them for up to four days. While tomatoes—like most fruits—do ripen once they’re picked, the flavor is never as sweet as if they’re allowed to stay on their fragrant vines in the field. If you live anywhere near a farmer’s market, I suggest you buy them there. Yield: 8 to 10 ounces of juice per pound of tomatoes. Sweet Potatoes/Yams. These two vegetables, both high in caro- tenes, vitamin C, calcium, and potassium, are decidedly different spe- cies, but I’m lumping them together because of their similarity in taste and because you can substitute one for another at any time. Look for tubers that are firm, shiny, and fresh-looking, and avoid ones that are shriveled. Store them in a cool, dry place. Scrub well before juicing, but there’s no need to peel them. Yield: 4 ounces of juice per pound of sweet potatoes or yams. Zucchini. This mild- tasting member of the summer squash family is a good source of vitamins A and C, potassium, and niacin. Choose small zuc- chini that are unblemished and firm, and refrigerate them for up to five days in a plastic bag. Substitute yellow crookneck squash for zucchini in any juice recipe, and even the color will not change because zucchini juice is such a pale green. Yield: 8 ounces of juice per pound of zucchini.

Lately, researchers are dis- covering more and more nutritional benefits from soy products. For example, soybeans are the only known plant source of complete protein. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a health claim stating that diets containing 25 grams of soy protein a day may reduce the risk of heart disease. Complete protein is the term used for a food that contains all the essential amino acids in the appropriate proportions that are part of the growth and maintenance of cells. Meats and some dairy prod- ucts have complete protein, while grains and beans contain incom- plete proteins. Blending incomplete proteins, such as rice and beans, produces a complete protein. But in the plant world, soy alone has it all. Liquid Lingo In addition, soy is low-fat, and products made from soy create great juices. Here are a few: Soy milk. This nondairy “milk” is made by grinding soybeans to a flourlike consistency, cooking the flour with water, and pressing out the liquid. Soy milk is rich in protein and iron, and most manufacturers fortify their soy milk with calcium as well. Whole and low-fat versions are also available. Use soy milk interchangeably with dairy milk in any recipe. Silken tofu. Tofu is a curd made from pressed and drained soybeans and comes in a num- ber of densities, such as firm and silken, depending on how hard it was pressed during manufacture. Tofu is high in B vitamins, potas- sium, and iron, and some tofu is also high in calcium, if that mineral was used as the curdling agent. The best tofu for juices is Although you can blend any form of tofu into your juices, do not substitute tempeh for tofu. Tempeh is made from fermented soybeans, and its crumbly tex- ture and savory flavor are not really compatible with many vegetables or fruits. Wrong Spin!"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Chapter 4: Added Attractions 37 silken tofu because it adds a soft texture to the drink. If you’re using a firmer tofu, you might want to add additional liquid to the blender. Powerful Powders You can easily turn a juice into an energy- and nutrient-packed meal by just adding a few tablespoons of a nutritional supplement for additional protein, vitamins, and minerals. You should be able to find most of these supplements in many grocery and most health food stores. They are not specified in the recipes in this book, but you can add any of them to any juice concoction. Bee pollen. Bee pollen is made from the seeds of flower blossoms that stick to the bees’ legs as they’re going about their tasks. When they return to their hive, they clean their legs, mixing these seeds with nectar and their own enzymes to form the pollen. It’s rich with protein; vitamins A, B, C, and E; as well as calcium and magnesium. Bee pollen doesn’t change the taste of juices at all, so add up to 2 tablespoons to any juice recipe. Flaxseed. Flaxseed is the best vegetable source for essential omega- 3 fatty acids, the same beneficial fat found in salmon and other fish. Flaxseed also contains lecithin, which aids in digestion. The seeds have to be ground up to release their benefits, so put up to 2 tablespoons into any juice recipe and blend away. Flaxseed does have a nutty flavor, but it will probably be masked by other ingredients in the juice. Soy protein powder. There are protein powders on the market made from cow’s milk or eggs, but the most popular is a flavorless pow- der with all the health benefits of soybeans. The texture of some brands tends to be a bit grainy, but you can add 2 or 3 tablespoons per juice recipe, and the texture from the other ingredients will mask that of the powder. Wheat germ. Wheat germ is the embryo of a wheat berry, and adding just 1 tablespoon to a juice recipe adds 2 grams of protein and 1 gram of fiber. It’s best to add all nutri- tional supplements to juices at the beginning of the blending process. Some, such as flaxseed and wheat germ, benefit from being puréed well while other ingredients are added to the blender. Juicy Jive"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Part 1: Component Parts 38 Wheat germ has a slightly nutty flavor. It’s an exceptional source of vitamin E and also contains thiamin and copper. Add up to 2 table- spoons per recipe—or more if you like the nutty flavor. Herbal Additions Fresh herbs add anticipatory aroma as well as fresh flavor to all foods, including juices. Botanically an herb is the leaf of specific plants, most of which grow in temperate climates. It’s easy to grow fresh herbs in your garden, and the aroma and flavor is never as good as the moment they’re picked. Even if you live in an apartment, you can grow small pots of herbs on a sunny window sill. The recipes in Chapter 7 are devoted to juices that star herbs along with vegetables and even the occasional fruit. But you can add herbs to any vegetable juice. Here is a list of frequently used herbs: Basil. Now more popular than ever garnishing many Italian dishes and as the main ingredient in pesto, basil has a pungent flavor and aroma that’s almost a cross between anise and cloves. Choose bunches with bright leaves that aren’t wilted. Chives. Chives are related to onions and leeks and have a very mild onion flavor. They’re long and green and can be snipped to any length with a pair of scissors. Cilantro. Cilantro, sometimes called fresh coriander or Chinese parsley, was almost unknown in this country until the 1980s when both regional American and ethnic cooking began to grow. It has a pun- gent aroma and flavor, and many consider it an acquired taste. It’s used extensively in Mexican, Southwestern, and Asian cooking. Dill. This fresh-tasting herb has feathery bright green leaves that look similar to those of fennel and is used extensively in Scandinavian cooking for such dishes as Gravlax and Swedish Meatballs. It’s also used in Greek dishes. Mint. Mint will take over a garden, so relegate it to a pot if you’re growing herbs. Two species of mint are widely available. Peppermint is the more pungent of the two and has bright green leaves. Spearmint, with gray-green leaves, is more delicate in aroma and color."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Chapter 4: Added Attractions 39 Oregano. This herb, popular in Mediterranean cooking, is a mem- ber of the mint family but is also related to both thyme and marjoram. It adds a pungent aroma and almost spicy flavor to juices. Parsley. Long before any other herbs began appearing in produce sections, cooks could always find a bunch of fresh-tasting parsley. In addition to using it in cook- ing, parsley’s probably the most ubiquitous garnish in the coun- try if not on the planet. Rosemary. Rosemary is another mint family cousin, and its long, bright green needles convey the aroma of pine with a slight flavor of lemon. It’s native to the Mediterranean region and is used in many European cuisines. Tarragon. Tarragon is one of the stalwarts of classic French cook- ing. It has a pungent anise aroma and flavor that blends very well with grassy vegetables like celery and asparagus. Great Garnishes You might think it’s crazy to garnish a juice. After all, you’ve already got a glass of a food with a delicious taste and (most of the time) a vivid color. But occasionally you might have a few extra minutes and want to make the juice more special. Or maybe it’s a special occasion and you want to elicit a “Wow!” when you serve the frosty glasses. Whatever your reason, garnish away! I’ve annotated each recipe with a suggested garnish, but you can ignore those suggestions and add any of these: Fruit kebabs. Kebabs are the no-brainer of garnishes. Reserve some of the fruit used in the juice and thread bite-size pieces onto a toothpick or a little plastic sword that doubles as a toothpick. For a fancier look, use a few different types of fruit. While there are more than 30 types of parsley, the most common ones are curly and Italian flat-leaf. Most cooks prefer the latter because it is more strongly fla- vored, but either can be used. Until a few years ago flat-leaf parsley was harder to find, but all supermarkets now carry both.

Rinse the berries, but do not remove the green cap. Using a sharp paring knife, make five or six cuts through the berry, start- ing at the cap. Transfer the straw- berry to a plate, and gently push a part the slices to form a fan. Herb sprigs. Any delicate herb, such as parsley, cilantro, mint, or dill, makes a pretty and edible garnish. Rinse the sprig, and tuck it on the side of the glass. Culinary Creations It’s always nice to know that a piece of kitchen equipment can do dou- ble duty, and that’s the case with juicers and blenders. While intended for drinks to quaff immediately, they can be useful in other ways. You’ll find criteria for selecting and using both juicers and blenders in Chapter 1 of this book. This section is intended to give you reasons to keep them on the counter. Smooth Sailing The basic difference between a juice and a smoothie is the texture. Smoothies are always thick because some of the ingredients are frozen. It’s easy to turn a juice into a smoothie by taking some of the juice and freezing it in ice cube trays. The proportion should be about half and half frozen and chilled. Then place the juice in a blender and turn it on high. In about 30 seconds you’ll have a thick, frosty juice drink. But don’t use ice cubes made from water or it will dilute the juice too much. Freezing does lessen some of the nutrients culled from the juice ingredients, but most of them are preserved. Herbs like rosemary, sage, and thyme are not appropriate for garnishes because the stems are too woody. Pull the leaves off the stems of all these herbs before using. Wrong Spin!"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Chapter 4: Added Attractions 41 Great Granitas To make a smoothie, freeze only half of the juice, but if you take the process further, the juice can become a granita . Serve these ices in myriad ways. Place a dollop on top of a chilled summer soup, serve it as a palate cleanser between courses, or place it on top of fresh fruit as a dessert. The easy way to make granita is to freeze all the juice in ice cube trays until it is about 75 percent frozen. Then place the cubes in a food processor fitted with a steel blade, and pulse it on and off until it becomes mushy. Return the mixture to the freezer in a mixing bowl. Once it has become frozen again, it’s ready to use. Remove the gra- nita to soften 20 minutes before serving it. Gourmet Gelatin Vegetable and fruit aspics are nothing more than juices thickened by gelatin. While they were very popular back in the 1960s, they fell from favor with devoted foodies. But like many foods, such as fondue, they’re beginning to make a comeback in popularity. Juicers make a mean aspic. The general rule of thumb is to use one 1 ⁄ 4 -ounce package of granulated gelatin for every 2 cups of liquid. The first step is to soak the granules in cold liquid for 3 to 5 minutes so they will soften and swell up. This makes them dissolve smoothly when heated. Granita is hard like granite, but it’s the Italian word for ice. The term is used to describe any hard, granular frozen ice that can be either sweet or savory. Liquid Lingo Commercial gelatin didn’t hit the scene until the late nineteenth century. Until then cooks had to make their own by laboriously boiling calves’ feet. The only other products that produced the desired effect were isinglass, which is a natural gelatin from fish air bladders, or carrageen, a dried seaweed. Most com- mercial gelatin today is a by- product of pig skin.

Other Ideas You’ll find that your juicer can become a useful piece of equipment for everyday cooking as well as juicing. All those trimmings and scraps you are now throwing into the garbage after prepping vegetables for dishes might be candidates to be pushed through the juicer to intensify the flavor of the dish you’re cooking. For example, if you’re making a dish with asparagus—like an aspar- agus risotto or cream of asparagus soup—chances are you’ll throw away the woody parts of the stems. But you can put them through the juicer and then use the resulting juice for part of the liquid specified in your recipe. The same holds true for any recipe made with broccoli. Are you making a pot of vegetable soup? Push the well-washed car- rot scrapings and celery trimmings through the juicer. While the nutri- ents will be lost through cooking, you’ll boost the flavor.

Indeed, carrots actually put forth lovely delicate white blossoms that chefs use to garnish plates when available. But there is some variation amongst the taproot clan.

They are related by families, and all plants in the cabbage family fall into the cruciferous clan. This term refers to the small cross shape which is formed when the flowers are growing. In eras before air importation made it possible for us to eat what- ever we wanted regardless of season, cabbages and their cousins were one of the mainstays of winter vegetables. The family includes cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, and new introductions such as broccoflower, which is a genetically engineered hybrid of broccoli and cauliflower. The importance of the cabbage clan for our diets is from the high amounts of sulphurophane they contain. Sulphurophane is a compound touted for its anti-cancer properties. This compound was discovered when the diets of East Germany and West Germany were compared during the Cold War. East Germans were poorer, and cabbage con- sumption was high. The rate of cancer in the country was much lower than that of the more prosperous West Germans."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Chapter 6: Drinks from the Cabbage Patch 61 Cabbage and Jerusalem Artichoke Serves 2 Prep time: less than 10 minutes Each serving: 262 calories 9 calories from fat 1 g fat 0 g saturated fat 8 g protein 61 g carbohydrates 1 ⁄ 4 head green cabbage (about 1 ⁄ 2 lb.) 2 Jerusalem artichokes 2 celery ribs 3 parsnips 1 cup firmly packed spinach leaves 3 scallions 1 sprig tarragon 2 sprigs tarragon for garnish (optional) 1.

Herbs have a tendency to be full of grit and sand. Keep in mind they grow close to the ground. So if a bunch looks dirty, let the sprigs soak in a bowl of ice water for a few minutes, and then remove them from the top. Don’t place them into a colander or the grit will go right back onto the herbs.

And if you choose to pulp them rather than juice them, you can easily serve them as soups. Most of these juices are enlivened with ingredients to boost the flavor. Some contain various forms of vinegar, while others have some spices added at the end. What you’ll find is that the flavors are complex and perk the palate.

But over the centuries we’ve come to use the term only for trees that produce fruit that humans eat. In the larger sense, nut trees, such as walnut and pecan, can also be considered fruit trees. This fruit is produced in a form of botanical sex through a process called pollination. Pollination is the transfer of pollen, which is the male part of the flower, to the stigma, which is the female part of the flower. This transfer of pollen is needed for fruit to set and seeds to develop. For this process, the honey bee is the trees’ best friend. And this is why honey is classified by the pollen the bees have moved around— ranging from common clover to exotic orange blossom or lavender. Vintage Vines While grapes grow on woody vines rather than trees, their fruit falls into the same category as that of deciduous trees. Literally thousands of varieties of grapes are grown, divided by color as well as by purpose. In general, the wine varietals like cabernet or chardonnay are not pleasant to eat off the vine because of the same high acid content that creates complexity in wine. Conversely, table grapes with low acidity would make very bland wine. While concord grapes are the ones most often used in grape juice, they’re hard to find in supermarkets."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Chapter 10: Tree-Ripened Treats 113 Gingered Apple and Pear Serves 2 Prep time: less than 10 minutes Each serving: 273 calories 9 calories from fat 1 g fat 0 g saturated fat 2 g protein 72 g carbohydrates 3 apples 3 ripe pears 2 TB. sliced fresh ginger 2 tsp. hoisin sauce 2 apple slices for garnish (optional) 1.

In botany berries are simple fleshy fruits, so the tomato, as well as the eggplant and avocado, qualifies. But in common usage a berry is a small, sweet fruit with many seeds. While the blueberry and the cranberry are actual berries, the strawberry is termed a false berry because we eat the material that sur- rounds the seeds. Both raspberries and blackberries are actually clusters of tiny fruits held together by common walls. That’s why they are hol- low in the center. Garnishing Greatness You’ve probably noticed that all the garnishes suggested for the juice drinks in this book are an ingredient comprising the mix. And that’s true for the recipes in this chapter, too, but tiny fruits like raspberries are just too little to stay perched on a glass. For a strawberry garnish, rinse the strawberry and cut it from the tip halfway up to the green top. Then you can secure it to the side of the glass. For smaller berries, the only way they won’t get lost in the juice is if they’re placed on skewers.

But recent studies indicate that any tea derived from the leaf of a warm- weather evergreen known as Camellia sinensis has similar properties. This includes all green, black, and red (oolong) teas. The leaves of this tree contain chemicals called polyphenols , which give tea its antioxidant punch. Herbal teas do not derive from this leaf and so do not have this particular health-promoting chemical. The degree of processing determines whether a tea will be green, black, or red. Green teas are the least processed. They are simply steamed quickly before packaging. Black and red teas are partially dried, crushed, and fermented. The length of fermentation, which causes the leaves to blacken, deter- mines whether the tea will be red or black. Tea also has fluoride for strong teeth, virtually no calo- ries, and half the amount of caf- feine found in an equal size cup of coffee. The question hasn’t been answered as to whether decaffeinated teas have the same polyphenols. Caffeine is a natural component of tea leaves. We do not yet know if removing caffeine also removes polyphenols. Brewing Bravado Centuries-old rituals go into brewing the perfect cup of tea, and every self-respecting native of either China or England would balk at the sight of a tea bag sitting in a cup. The first step of this brewing process is to warm the tea pot with very hot water, and then drain it. Then place the loose tea into the empty pot, and pour water over it. The temperature of the water and the amount of time needed for the tea to brew varies with the type of tea: Polyphenols are anti- oxidants that help protect cells from the damage of free radicals, neutralize enzymes essential for tumor growth, and deactivate cancer promoters. They are now known to help prevent cancer, and they are tied to preventing heart disease.

The Herbal Alternative A number of plants, both herbs and flowers, are dried and brewed into tea. Some of the more popular are chamomile, which many devotees say calms the nerves and lessens muscle cramps, and rosehip tea that’s made from the berries formed by wild roses. Tea made from the petals of St. John’s wort is touted as possibly relieving depression. Rosemary, sage, thyme, ginger, and cinnamon are all used to infuse herbal teas. Herbal teas don’t contain any caffeine, but they also don’t have the same antioxidant benefits as green or black tea. Steep is the verb used when dry ingredients, such as tea leaves, herbs, or dried mushrooms, are soaked in hot liquid until the flavor of the ingredient is infused into the liquid.

As vodka has virtually no taste, just don’t add it to any recipe. For rum, the other liquor speci- fied in many of these recipes, a dash of rum extract adds a flavor that is similar. With wines it’s even easier to omit the alcohol. Many options are available for nonalcoholic wines, some of which are produced by famous wineries and have a delicious flavor. They’re made from the same grape varietals used for the “hard stuff” and with a similar process as wine with one big difference—no alcohol is added for fermentation.
