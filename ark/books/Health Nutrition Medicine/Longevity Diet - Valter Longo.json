And they have deeply fascinatedme since I was a teenager. Back then I wanted to become a rock star, and I wassure I would always be a professional musician, but my passion to discover thesecrets of longevity and how they could revolutionize medicine wouldn’t bedrowned out, no matter how fantastic a rock career appeared to be. When I was asophomore in college, I decided to put music to the side and dedicate myself toscience so that I could study the processes by which we age. Three decadeslater, I still play guitar, but I spend the majority of my time working as thedirector of the University of Southern California (USC) Longevity Institute inLos Angeles and the Program on Longevity and Cancer at IFOM (Molecular OncologyFIRC Institute) in Milan, where I combine studies of centenarians withepidemiological studies of populations, clinical trials, and basic research tounderstand how to help people live long lives.But it’s not just the idea of living longer that has driven me; it’s livinghealthy longer, staying vibrant and youthful beyond the traditional lifeexpectancy. To achieve this, my laboratories performed decades of cellular,animal, and human studies focused on maximizing function (learning, memory,physical fitness, etc.) and on the prevention and treatment of diseases, with aspecial focus on cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease as well asautoimmune and neurodegenerative disorders. Contrary to the notion that if welive longer we will extend the “sickness” period, our data indicate that byunderstanding how the human body is maintained while young, we can stay fullyfunctional into our nineties, hundreds, and beyond. One of the primary ways toachieve this is to exploit our body’s innate ability to regenerate itself at thecellular and organ levels. Unfortunately, the modern diet, and the constantconsumption that characterizes the way so much of the first world eats, keepsthese built-in mechanisms permanently switched off, leaving us prematurelyvulnerable to disease and degeneration beginning in our thirties and forties.But as I’ve discovered over the past thirty years of research, that switch canbe turned back on rather easily. The difficult part has been figuring out a wayto do it that is feasible and safe for everyone.Let me back up. I was sixteen when I first came to America from Genoa (hometownof Christopher Columbus), in the northwest of Italy. That’s where I was born andraised, though I spent my summers in Calabria, the southern Italian region wheremy parents came from. Harboring my dreams of fame and fortune as a rock star—andhaving driven neighbors in my building crazy for long enough with loud electricguitars—I arrived in Chicago to live with an aunt and pursue my music studies.Along with the thriving music scene, and some of the best blues in the nation, Iwas exposed for the first time to the American diet. Having grown up in tworegions with some of the healthiest cuisines in the world and never reallyhaving thought about it, I was amazed at the giant portions, the huge amounts ofmeat and cheese consumed at almost every meal, the sugary drinks and snacks soreadily available. The other thing I noticed was that my Italian relativesliving in Chicago were developing diabetes, heart disease, and other ailmentsuncommon to the family back home. At the time, I didn’t think much of it, butlater these exposures motivated me and helped me solidify hypotheses about diet,diseases, and longevity.By the time I got to the University of North Texas just outside of Dallas a fewyears later to continue my music education, my fascination with aging had takenhold. All my friends who were approaching or past thirty were starting to lamentgetting old. But something else, maybe my having been in the room when mygrandfather died, was stuck in my head, waiting for an opportunity to guide mein a new direction. As much as I loved music, in my second year as anundergraduate I realized that what I really wanted to do with my life was studyhow people stay young, so I moved to the biochemistry department to beginstudying aging. Four years later, I entered one of the best programs for thebiology of aging, the pathology PhD programs at the University of California,Los Angeles, and the laboratory of Roy Walford, MD, who at the time was theworld’s leading expert on nutrition and longevity, a field that was justbeginning to come into its own. The rest is history.I have now been researching healthy longevity for more than thirty years,studying the links between nutrition and the genes that regulate cellularprotection and regeneration. The Longevity Diet collects what I have learned andputs it into a simple program anyone can live by. It is as simple as adoptingthe daily nutritional regimen I outline and combining it periodically (two totwelve times per year, depending on your general health) with myfasting-mimicking diet (FMD), which is exactly what it sounds like: a diet thatmimics a fast, providing the benefits of fasting without the deprivation andhunger. Combining these two elements, I have discovered, can protect,regenerate, and rejuvenate the body to keep us young and healthy longer. This isachieved in part by turning back the biological aging clock, which means thatthese diets can be adopted by relatively young people to help delay aging andprevent disease, and also by older individuals to help them return to a moreyouthful state. The FMD is also clinically proven to stimulate the loss ofabdominal fat while conserving muscle and bone mass. These benefits aregenerated by switching on the human body’s own remarkable ability to activatestem cells and regenerate parts of cells, systems, and organs, leading to areduction of risk factors for many diseases. In the chapters that follow, I willexplain first why it works, then how it works. I will also explain how we tookadvantage of scientific and clinical experience to make nutritional strategiessafe and feasible while minimizing the need for drastic dietary changes. Ourdietary interventions are now recommended by thousands of doctors in the UnitedStates, Europe, and Asia.Among other things that I believe set this book apart from the thousands ofother diet and wellness books out there is that it is based on a solidmultidisciplinary foundation. We are constantly bombarded with new science thatdemonizes or exalts one food or another. For this reason, I devised amethodology that would ensure the widest possible scientific basis for myrecommendations. I call this method the Five Pillars of Longevity. These pillarsdo not refer to specific interventions such as diet and exercise, but to fivedisciplines that provide the foundation for my nutrition program: 1)basic/juventology research (juventology, as I will explain, is the science ofstaying young); 2) epidemiology; 3) clinical studies; 4) studies ofcentenarians; and 5) the understanding of complex systems (like cars, forexample). By thus providing the widest, most solid grounds possible for dietaryand exercise recommendations, we not only ensure their efficacy, but we alsoreduce to a minimum the chance that a future set of studies will drasticallyalter them. The past thirty years of research, and learning from many scientistsin these different fields, have allowed me to build a system that I believe issolid enough that you can use it for life.My search for the secrets to youthful longevity has led me all around the world,from Los Angeles to the Andes of southern Ecuador; from Okinawa, Japan, toRussia; from the Netherlands to southern Germany. But ultimately it led me backto Italy. Though I had no idea of this when I was growing up, the part ofnorthern Italy where I was born and raised happens to be home to one of thehighest percentages of people over age sixty-five in the world (28.3 percent,according to the Italian National Institute of Statistics in 2016), and theregion in the south where I spent every summer of my childhood has, wediscovered, one of the highest proportions of centenarians worldwide. It hasbeen a very surprising coincidence but also a confirmation and privilege of mylife’s work to take my studies back to where I grew up and be able to see thatpart of the world again through the eyes of people who have lived long, healthy,and full lives there. Inspired by all my long-lived friends back home and aroundthe world, this book is for anyone who wishes to join their ranks.A NOTE ON PROCEEDS AND PRODUCTSThis book gives you the advantage of many years of research into how to livelong and healthy lives, but there is another benefit; with 100 percent of mybook royalties going to charity, you’ll also be helping to fund valuableresearch through organizations like the Create Cures Foundation(www.createcures.org [http://www.createcures.org]), a nonprofit organization Ifounded to support people with advanced-stage or complex diseases in need ofintegrative and more effective treatments. Every day I get emails from peoplewho have been diagnosed with serious diseases—cancer, autoimmune and metabolicdisorders, neurodegenerative diseases, etc.—seeking options beyond the standardtreatments offered by their doctors. Unfortunately, professional guidelines,fear of legal action, heavy caseloads, and the complexity of illness work tokeep doctors narrowly focused on standard-of-care treatments, and often patientsaren’t given integrative options even if they ask. As I spent time withclinicians working on innovative therapies for cancer and other diseases, itbecame clear that they needed researchers like me to help them offer integrativeinterventions that could be safe, built on solid research, and advantageous totheir patients, who in many cases do not have the option of waiting years forthe end of large clinical trials.This is how I came to start the Create Cures Foundation. Our mission is to makeevidence-based information available to the public, to empower those who want tocomplement traditional treatments with reliable, scientifically based andclinically tested strategies to improve the efficacy of the therapy but alsoreduce its side effects. Our goal is not to diminish the role of medical doctorsin patient care, but to enhance it by providing information on integrativeapproaches supported by strong animal and clinical data. We live in a time whenfunding for research is getting tighter, with very little going to creative oralternative ideas, which is why my profits from the sale of this book will gostraight to the Create Cures Foundation and other nonprofit universities andinstitutes. So go ahead and buy more copies! Give them to your friends andfamily. You’ll be helping whomever you give it to, and you’ll also be directlyfunding our ongoing research into aging, cancer, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s,cardiovascular disease, multiple sclerosis, Crohn’s disease and colitis, andtype 1 and type 2 diabetes. (I list these particular diseases because we haveperformed basic research on all of them, and are planning or have started, andin some cases completed, clinical trials with documented success.) We arecommitted to transforming research into improved, applicable therapies asrapidly as we can by thinking broadly and creatively. Our approach is to workwith as many leading hospitals and research institutes as possible—at the momentthese include Harvard, the Mayo Clinic, Charité–University Medicine Berlin,Leiden University, and University of Genova, among many others—even as wecontinue to perform our own basic research and clinical trials at USC’s LeonardDavis School of Gerontology and Keck Medical Center, one of the largest and bestuniversity hospitals in the United States, and at the IFOM Cancer ResearchInstitute, in Milan, Italy. You can receive updates on our research, includingupcoming clinical trials, on my Facebook page, @profvalterlongo[https://www.facebook.com/profvalterlongo/], and at www.createcures.org[http://www.createcures.org].Virtually every one of the patients who wrote to me asked the same question:having heard that my fasting-mimicking diet can bring all the benefits offasting without the actual fasting part, they want to know what they can eatwhile on the “fast.” In response, and in order to make the FMD available as wellas safe and effective for everyone, I started a company called L-Nutra(www.l-nutra.com [http://www.l-nutra.com]). With support from the US NationalCancer Institute, the National Institute on Aging, and other funding agencies,we first developed a clinically tested FMD for cancer patients (Chemolieve®),then one for everyone (ProLon®). One hundred percent of my shares in L-Nutra arecommitted to the Create Cures Foundation and other nonprofit organizationsinvolved in research relevant to our mission. (I receive neither a salary nor aconsulting fee from L-Nutra—though in the interest of full disclosure, I doreceive minimal expense reimbursement.) Although I do not directly make pricingdecisions, I am committed to ensuring that L-Nutra’s products are as affordableas possible without compromising quality or the company’s ability to grow andmake its products available around the world.ProLon is already available through the L-Nutra website in the United States andis recommended by a network of physicians and other healthcare professionals.Chemolieve is currently being tested at several leading cancer centers,including USC, the Mayo Clinic, and Leiden University, and there is a long listof institutions waiting to test different FMDs for many diseases and conditionsas soon as funding becomes available.Many eager patients have asked whether it’s necessary to buy the products anduse them under supervision, or whether they can just do the FMD themselves athome. I always answer the question by first reminding people that half of myprogram, the everyday Longevity Diet part, consists of foods that can bepurchased in any supermarket and does not require supervision or speciallyformulated products. The Longevity Diet alone will help prevent and treat manydiseases, and will also reduce the recommended frequency of the FMD. That said,when it comes to the FMD, after years of experience with patients doing it indifferent ways—with the product and without; under supervision and not—I’veconcluded that it should really be done with the clinically tested product andpreferably under the supervision of a registered dietitian or physician.Although all ingredients are completely safe, fasting and FMDs have powerfuleffects that can be turned against aging and diseases but that can also resultin side effects, in some cases severe. The use of the clinically tested product,along with the right screening and supervision, will guarantee maximum safetyand efficacy. (The great majority of experts recommend that prolonged fastingperiods—anything more than one day—be done only in clinics under the supervisionof specialized medical personnel.) The clinically tested ProLon FMD will allowmost people to do the diet at home. If you are healthy and have the means andaccess to consult a registered dietitian before undertaking the FMD, especiallyfor the first time, it is strongly recommended that you do so. If you have beendiagnosed with a disease, you must have the approval of your doctor. You canfind information and specialists on L-Nutra’s website."},{"pageContent":"Penguin walking logo [../images/PCHI_1.gif]CHAPTER 1CARUSO’S FOUNTAINBACK TO MOLOCHIODrive an hour and a half north from the southernmost tip of Italy and you’llreach a little town called Molochio in the region of Calabria. Its name isprobably derived from the Greek word molokhē, meaning “mallow,” which is amedicinal plant with a bright purple flower. In the central piazza, there’s afountain you can safely drink from, its cold water flowing via undergroundsprings directly from the Aspromonte mountains.In 1972, when I was five years old, I spent six months in Molochio with mymother, who had gone there to stay with my ailing grandfather. For many years,my nonno Alfonso had neglected a hernia, a simple condition that could have beentreated with the right care. The day he died, everyone was calling his name towake him. I walked in the room and said, “Can’t you see that he has diedalready?” I was very close to my grandfather, and his death caused me greatsadness; but even as a child, I felt that dealing with aging and death wassomething that I was supposed to do, that I had to take charge of the situationsomehow.Our neighbor in Molochio, Salvatore Caruso, was about the same age as mygrandfather. In 2012, forty years after my grandfather’s death, Salvatore and Iwould appear in the same issue of the scientific journal Cell Metabolism for mygroup’s discovery that a low-protein diet, based on the eating habits ofMolochio’s elders, is associated with low cancer and overall mortality rates inthe US population. The cover image of 108-year-old Salvatore standing among theCalabrian olive trees made the pages of The Washington Post and media around theglobe. Two years after that, Salvatore was the oldest man in Italy, and one offour centenarians living in Molochio. Since there were only around two thousandpeople living there at the time, this meant Molochio had one of the highestproportions of centenarians in the world (four times that of Okinawa, Japan,which is believed to have the highest rate of centenarians for a large region).Salvatore, who died in 2015 at the age of 110, started drinking from Molochio’sfountain soon after he was born in 1905; given the exceptional longevity of somany of the town elders, it’s tempting to think it might be the closest thing wehave to a real fountain of youth. But while that’s an interesting thought, I’vespent most of my life studying the science of living long, and the truth isnothing so enchanted. You don’t need to travel to Molochio to drink from itsfountain of youth—but if you did, you would learn many of the secrets oflongevity from its centenarians.image [../images/9781405933940_TheLongevityDiet_001_IMGX.jpg]1.1. The fountain in the piazza of MolochioFROM TRADITION TO SCIENCEWhether by luck or destiny, my life took a path that has given me a unique andinvaluable perspective on different diets and cultures. From the Calabrian dietof Molochio, where I spent childhood summers, to the pescetarian Ligurian dietof Genoa, where I was raised, to the heavy American diets of Chicago and Texas,to the health-obsessed diet of that mecca of youthfulness, Los Angeles—I’velived the full range of good, bad, and excellent nutrition, which has helped meformulate hypotheses about the connection between food, disease, and longevity.It also helped me realize that in order to understand how people can live long,healthy lives, we need to go beyond scientific, epidemiological, and clinicalstudies and investigate actual populations that age successfully.Although I didn’t know it at the time, I grew up between two places that boastamong the healthiest traditional diets in the world. Unlike other regions ofItaly famous for their meats (Tuscany) or their heavy cream-based sauces (Lazio,Emilia-Romagna), Liguria and Calabria maintained a cuisine based on complexcarbohydrates and vegetables, with dishes like minestrone, pansotti al sugo dinoce (a ravioli-like pasta with vegetable filling served in a walnut sauce), andfarinata (garbanzo beans and olive oil). During the summers of my childhood inCalabria, we lived simply; almost every morning my brother or sister or I walkedup the hill to the bakery to buy fresh bread, hot from the oven, dark from thewhole wheat from which it was made. About once every other day, for either lunchor dinner, we ate pasta e vaianeia, which consisted of a small amount of pastatossed together with large amounts of vegetables, particularly green beanscooked in the pod. Another common dish was stoccafisso, or stockfish—a dried codsimilar to baccala but without the salt—served with a vegetable side dish. Othercommon ingredients of our diet growing up were black olives, olive oil, and lotsof tomatoes, cucumbers, and green peppers. Meat was a once-a-week treat; only onSundays would we have homemade maccheroni pasta with polpette (meatballs)—twoeach—or sometimes a small steak. The most common drinks were water (from themountain spring), local wine, tea, coffee, and almond milk. We often drankgoat’s milk instead of cow’s milk in the morning. Between meals we were allowedto snack only on peanuts, almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts, raisins, grapes, or cornon the cob. Once we finished dinner around 8 p.m., we usually wouldn’t eatanything until the next morning. Even at our celebratory village fairs, thesweets were made with nuts and dried fruit. And instead of ice cream, we wouldoften have granita, the frozen dessert somewhere between a smoothie and asorbet. Made with lots of fruit, it is, in my opinion, the best dessert in theworld, but it does contain a lot of sugar. We had to go six miles down the road,to the town of Taurianova, to find the good one.The traditional diet of Genoa and its region Liguria is arguably as healthy asthat of Calabria’s; low in sugar, it consists of a lot of vegetables, garbanzobeans, olive oil, anchovies, codfish, and mussels, all of which representimportant components of the Longevity Diet I present in this book.FROM LIGURIAN TO CHICAGOANWhen I was twelve years old, I would lock myself in my room with my electricguitar, turn the amplifier up to ten, and play along to the albums of DireStraits, Jimi Hendrix, and Pink Floyd. I dreamed of going to America to become arock star. That opportunity came in 1984 when, at age sixteen, I left Genoa tolive with my aunt in Chicago. A music-crazed teenager, I arrived in the LittleItaly district of Melrose Park, in the Chicago suburbs, with my guitar stickingout of my backpack, lugging a portable amp. My spoken-language skills were sobad that the immigration official stamped “no English” on my passport. Chicagohad an incredible music scene. I took guitar lessons with Stewart Pearce, aniconic local bebop player. I was mostly interested in rock, but I knew thatlearning to play jazz and bebop would make me a much better rock guitar player.On weekends, I would sneak out of my aunt’s house and take the L train downtown,where I would plug in and jam with musicians in blues clubs all night long.My exposure to some of the best blues in the world coincided with my exposure tosome of the unhealthiest food in the world—what I consider “the heart attackdiet.” At the time, I knew nothing about nutrition and aging, but I rememberthinking something must be wrong with the Windy City diet because so many of myrelatives there—mostly ethnic Calabrians—were dying of cardiovascular diseases,which were relatively uncommon in southern Italy in general, and wereparticularly rare in my extended family.These southern Italians in America were eating bacon and sausage with eggs forbreakfast, then lots of pasta, bread, and meat for lunch, often having meatagain for dinner. They also consumed high quantities of cheese, milk, andhigh-fat, high-sugar desserts. The famous Chicago pizza had more calories fromcheese than from the dough. Drinks were usually sodas or equally high-fructosefruit juices. To make matters worse, much of the food we Chicagoans ate wasfried. Not surprisingly, many people I knew were overweight or obese by agethirty. Although I never became obese, I ate like everyone else and grew a lotduring my three years in Chicago. My height shot up to six feet two, almosteight inches taller than my father and four inches taller than my brother. Apossible explanation for this was all the meat suddenly in my diet, which, alongwith protein, probably contained steroid hormones.I graduated high school in Chicago and headed south to study jazz performance atthe famous University of North Texas College of Music. I could never haveimagined eating more or becoming bigger than I was in Chicago—until I joined theArmy Reserve as a way to pay for my education in Texas. Arriving for boot campin Fort Knox, Kentucky, I joined a battalion of Army tankers who trained withthe Marines and took pride in pushing themselves to the limit. We slept onlythree or four hours a night, did push-ups and other vigorous exercises all daylong, and we ate—a lot.I spent two summers at Fort Knox doing things I never would have believed myselfcapable of. It was the toughest and probably the best training of my life. TheArmy taught me how to get things done quickly, meeting the highest standardswhile minimizing or eliminating mistakes. Our trainers expected the impossibleall the time. If you could do fifty push-ups, they told us, you should be goingfor a hundred. If you could run two miles in twelve minutes, they’d scream, youshould finish in ten. I found out that sometimes when the impossible isexpected, it can be achieved—eventually I was able to run two miles in tenminutes.The Army diet was based on meat and carbohydrates, with sugary sodas allowed asa reward only if we had a combined run, push-up, and sit-up score of 200—whichmeant about seventy push-ups and sixty sit-ups in under two minutes each, plusrunning two miles in under ten and a half minutes. In retrospect, I can see howaddicted we all were to sugary drinks; we craved that mix of phosphoric acid,caramel coloring, and sugar, and everyone envied the very few who could reachthat 200-point mark.This diet, along with the grueling exercise regimen, made me a lot bigger,increasing the size of my muscles and making me stronger—at least that’s what Iassumed at the time. As I will explain in more detail in a later chapter, ourrecent studies indicate that a protein-rich diet, which can increase musclesize, may not necessarily translate into increased muscle strength and that aperiodic low-protein, low-sugar diet, alternating with periods of normal proteinintake, may do more to generate new muscle cells (which we currently think hasmore to do with strength than size does) while promoting health. In the tenyears after basic training, during which my diet consisted of a lot of meat,fats, and proteins, my strength and stamina were dramatically reduced. But thenI slowly switched to the Longevity Diet, and more than twenty-five years later Ican do about the same number of push-ups and sit-ups as I did at boot camp whenI was nineteen and supposedly in peak shape.My stint in the Army eventually got me interested in how and why different typesof diets can improve health without negatively affecting muscle mass andstrength. The answer lies in nutritechnology, a new field I have helped create,in which we treat ingredients found in normal food as a complex set of moleculesthat, in specific doses and combinations, can have drug-like beneficialproperties that we can harness to delay aging and prevent disease.1[chapter001_notes.xhtml#ch01-1]IN TUNE WITH EVOLUTIONMy destination after finishing boot camp was Denton, Texas, just north ofDallas, home of the University of North Texas and one of the largest and bestjazz performance programs in the world, where I was set to pursue anundergraduate degree in jazz performance. The program was tough, requiring anall-out, sixteen-hour-a-day, seven-days-a-week effort as a freshman. Jazz greatslike pianist Dan Haerle and guitarist Jack Petersen became my teachers.Many people in my career as a scientist who know about my beginnings as a jazzmusician wonder how I came to make such a drastic change in my life’s direction.The truth is, though music and science are obviously very different, you mightbe surprised at how much my musical training has helped me in the lab andspurred me on to discoveries that required creative approaches.If you’re trained from childhood to recognize chords, the ability to recognizefrequencies and intervals isn’t that difficult. It’s like learning a newlanguage, akin to a child recognizing spoken words and understanding what isbeing said. However, I was a mostly self-taught guitar player who learnedthrough listening, so being all of a sudden exposed to a new language wasparticularly challenging for me; in the jazz program, I learned how tounderstand and write in a language I had always known simply as sound.Similarly, as a scientist, you are always observing; but that observation isuseless if you can’t transform it into data or hypotheses. Musical trainingturned out to be essential for many of the discoveries I made about why we ageand how it’s connected to nutrition. When I started my research on aging,everyone could see that organisms aged, and everyone suspected that genes weresomehow involved in that process; but the scientific community had no idea howto translate these observations into quantifiable genetic and molecularexplanations. What were the harmonies and melodies of life and death? How couldwe decipher and transcribe these incredibly complex processes so that we mightact upon and change them?As an example of how my music training informed my scientific inquiry, here’sone of my favorite analogies, which I use to explain what’s missing from theprevalent “free radical” theory of aging, which holds that antioxidants alone(higher doses of vitamin C, for example) can extend the healthy human lifespan:Trying to extend your lifespan by increasing your intake of vitamin C is liketrying to improve a Mozart symphony by increasing the number of cello players.The cello is a beautiful instrument, but to improve a Mozart symphony, you needto be a better composer than Mozart. Adding cellos alone won’t do it. Thehealthy human lifespan is much more complex than a Mozart symphony. It tookbillions of years of evolution for it to reach the current state ofnear-perfection. We cannot expect a simple supplement to make something that’salmost perfect even better, so we cannot expect that we will live healthier andlonger lives just by drinking orange juice. Not surprisingly, supplementationwith antioxidants has not even been shown to extend the lifespan of mice.Another advantage musical studies gave me as a scientist was a training inimprovisation and composition, important elements in jazz, to be sure, and alsoin science; improvisation challenges you to understand what you hear in relationto what you play so thoroughly and instantaneously that you can react to andmatch it on the fly. But this is only the start, since in jazz eventually theimprovisation breaks free from the chord progression, often violating rules thatwould never be violated in classical music. However, the improviser is alwaysaware of the chords, and the violation must follow new rules, albeit much moreflexible ones. In science, this skill keeps you on the lookout for ideas thatmight be new or surprising but that are also well grounded, as opposed tolooking for trendy discoveries that are just variations on previousbreakthroughs. Composition instead forces you to write music that no one haswritten before; but unlike with improvisation, the music must be structured, andall the melodies and harmonies, as well as the instruments playing them and theway they are played, must be defined. In science and medicine, the musiccomposer approach pushes you to look for new ideas, new hypotheses, but it alsorequires that the intervention has a mathematical foundation and is in harmonywith the human body and its history. I call this being in tune with evolution.For example, as I will discuss elsewhere in the book, if we use a drug thatlowers glucose, we are not considering the harmony of the human body, since thatdrug is disrupting a normal function of the organism. Although this may lead toa temporary solution (lower glucose), in the long run it will usually also leadto problems (adverse side effects). If instead we can rejuvenate theinsulin-resistant muscle cells that cause the high glucose levels and renderthem more functional, we are making changes that maintain and even increase theharmony of the human body. Further, if this rejuvenation is activated by takingadvantage of environments and conditions that echo our past and more ancientorganisms, then we are not only taking advantage of the harmony, but we are also“in tune with evolution,” since that process matches the “frequencies” of ourhistory. Fasting, which is the focus of much of this book, activates coordinatedresponses that are in tune with evolution because starvation was encountered byall organisms, starting with bacteria, billions of years before Homo sapienseven existed. For this reason, it is clearly one of the most powerfulinterventions we can rediscover to promote coordinated changes that do notdisrupt the harmony of the human body.Without scientists and researchers thinking outside the box and being open tonew possibilities and ideas, many of the greatest scientific and medicaldiscoveries could never have been made—from Alexander Fleming’s discovery ofpenicillin, to James Watson and Francis Crick and others’ unraveling of thestructure of DNA.It was at the University of North Texas that I decided to switch my studies frommusic to science. One day during my second year there, an academic counselorasked me when I was going to enroll in Music Teaching, a course in which I wouldhave to direct a marching band. It was the marching band that decided it. I hadno intention of ever leading a marching band! For one thing, I was a rockmusician. But for another, was this really what I wanted to do with my life? Allof a sudden I didn’t think so. I still play guitar to this day, but after a fewdays of wandering the streets of Denton, Texas, I decided that I wanted todevote my life to the study of how we age—or rather, how we might stay young andhealthy for as long as possible.I had noticed people I knew in their thirties worrying about “getting old.” Andit seemed like forty was the age at which people started to become vulnerable tomajor disease. As a twenty-year-old, I wondered: Why can’t we push that back tofifty, sixty, even further? The field of aging provided a fantastic opportunity.It combined the impossible scientific task of understanding why we grow old anddie with the idea I was just beginning to understand: that if we can effectivelyact on the aging process, we can postpone and even prevent many common diseases,enabling people to stay young and healthy as long as possible.Along with my musical training, another element of my background has helped mein my career, and that is self-doubt. After making the decision to switchprograms, I went to see the chairman of the biochemistry department, excited todiscuss my new program of study. He was, to put it mildly, highly skeptical of ajazz performance major who had never taken a biology course, who now wanted totransfer into the biochemistry program to study aging. He told me that I wascrazy and that I wouldn’t last a semester. His reaction gave me pause—maybe hewas right. My father was a policeman, and my mother, as was the cultural normwhen I grew up, ran the house and only worked occasionally as a tailor; neitherof my parents, who had emigrated to Genoa from the south, had more than aprimary school education. So I wasn’t sure I could do it. Maybe I was beingpresumptuous; maybe it was ridiculous to think that I’d be able to keep up. Inretrospect, I realize it was probably this doubt that helped me succeed—in theprogram and as a scientist. My lab’s motto and modus operandi is “paranoia.” Onthe one hand, I teach my students never to trust their results, nor those ofothers, and always to expect that something will go wrong—the great result theymight be so excited about will probably change under further scrutiny andexperimentation, or when looked at from a different angle. On the other hand, Iteach them that everything is possible. Think of big ideas; if you can dream it,you might be able to do it.Our popular culture depicts scientists as confident-leader types, sure of whatthey’re doing and the outcomes they will achieve. And it’s true that this is amind-set I frequently encounter at universities and in hospitals. Even in mycollege days, though, I understood that confidence was a way for arrogance tousurp knowledge. I believe the most revolutionary discoveries come fromcreativity and doubts because they first appear as crazy ideas, but then undergoa grueling process that makes them real and repeatable.I didn’t let my doubts stop me back then, and a year later I was thriving in thebiochemistry program, working in the lab of the same doctor who had so doubtedme. Soon I would be driving sixty miles a day to work in the lab of Dr. RobertGracy, a leading aging research expert in Texas, where I would begin studyingone of the most important aspects of aging: the process by which proteins aredamaged. We can think of proteins as both the bricks that support an organismand the switchboard that transmits biological information from cell to cell, orwithin cells. For example, growth hormone is the protein that circulates in theblood-activating growth hormone receptors on the surface of cells, whichpromotes human growth. Like all proteins, growth hormone can be modified anddamaged through aging, which can affect its function. Dr. Gracy’s research groupwas studying how to potentially reverse this protein damage. This study would bethe beginning of my research in the extraordinary field of longevity.Hamburgers, french fries, and other unhealthy foods, especially Tex-Mex,remained my everyday diet throughout my undergraduate studies in Texas. Tex-Mexcombines the worst food elements, transforming the relatively healthy Mexicancuisine into a terribly unhealthy one by frying everything and addinglow-quality cheeses and meats. In spite of my new area of study, it didn’t occurto me yet that my diet could affect my health and might be setting me up fordisease. Not surprisingly, a few years after graduating from college, mycholesterol and blood pressure were high, and doctors were ready to load me upwith statins and hypertension drugs. But by then I had joined the UCLAlaboratory of Dr. Roy Walford, who was at the time the world’s leading expert onnutrition and longevity. My diet, and life, were both about to change."},{"pageContent":"Penguin walking logo [../images/PCHI_1.gif]CHAPTER 2AGING, PROGRAMMED LONGEVITY, AND JUVENTOLOGYWHY WE AGEThe approach in this book is different from that of the great majority ofnutrition books because I focus on keeping organisms young, not treatingindividual diseases or conditions. So it’s important to understand what aging isand the strategies that have the best chance of slowing it down without causingside effects.“Aging” refers to the changes that occur over time to both organisms andobjects. These changes aren’t necessarily negative. In fact, although humans andmost other organisms become dysfunctional in old age, growing older can actuallybring improvements as well. For example, New York marathon winners are typicallyin their thirties, and many of the top finishers are in their forties. Thissuggests that there can be overall positive changes in the human body associatedwith aging.So why do we age? Clearly every object around us, from houses to cars, gets oldand deteriorates, so perhaps a better question is this: Why wouldn’t humans andall other organisms also age and die?Natural selection, the process Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace described toexplain evolution, has resulted in mechanisms that protect an organism, such asDNA repair, until it can generate healthy offspring. Over millions of years ofevolution, the lifespan of an organism will tend to get longer if its ability togenerate healthy offspring also increases. Both Wallace and Darwin alsohypothesized that aging and death may be programmed so that organisms could ageon purpose and die prematurely if it were advantageous to the species—to avoidovercrowding, for example. You can think of it like a company that establishesmandatory retirement at age sixty-five in order to allow younger employees to behired, with the idea that ultimately this benefits the company. Both scientistsabandoned this theory because, at the time, it would have been extremelydifficult to demonstrate, since they did not have the computational, molecularbiology, and genetics tools we have now.A century and a half later, my laboratory produced one of the first pieces ofexperimental evidence for this “programmed aging” hypothesis. We showed that aselfish group of microorganisms—in this case baker’s yeast that had beengenetically manipulated to invest in their own protection and live as long aspossible—would eventually become extinct, whereas shorter-lived microorganismswilling to sacrifice themselves and die early would seed future generations. Inother words, the genetic alterations that make the organism act selfishly andlive longer decrease its chances of generating healthy offspring. Whether humanbeings are actually programmed to die, however, has not been demonstrated.To fully demonstrate programmed aging, one must first demonstrate groupselection—one of the most hotly debated and challenged theories of evolutionarybiology. Group selection posits that groups of organisms can act in analtruistic way, to protect or benefit the group at the individual’s expense.In most cases, it can be argued that altruistic behavior—a bird flying in frontof the flock, for instance, thereby taking additional risks for the sake of thegroup—is just a case of paying one’s dues, and that the risk taken willeventually benefit the individual taking the risk. But when an organism dies tobenefit others, it’s impossible to deem it a selfish act. Either death isoccurring by chance (i.e., it serves no purpose), or it’s programmed andaltruistic. Over the past ten years, I have argued for programmed aging in aseries of public debates against experts who argued for traditional evolutionaryaging theories. After two such debates, in Texas and California, the audience,made up of scientists, was asked to vote on the theory that seemed right. Inboth cases I lost, though the vote and following discussions suggested I hadconvinced nearly half of them. Why? I believe it’s because current evolutionarytheories are accepted as dogma, and most scientists just aren’t willing toconsider alternative possibilities. To maximize the chance for everyone to makeit to 110 healthy, it is important to consider these evolutionary theories andtake advantage of the programs that have evolved to extend longevity in responseto changes in the environment. For example, we showed that the “altruistic deathprogram” described above is inactivated by starvation, indicating that anorganism left without food no longer dies to benefit others, probably becausethe others are not expected to be around to benefit.There are hundreds of theories of how and why we age. Many are partially trueand overlap. For example, the popular free radical theory of aging I alreadymentioned proposes that oxygen and other reactive molecules that function asoxidants can cause damage to virtually all components of a cell and organism,similar to the rusting of metals when exposed to oxygen and water. TomKirkwood’s “disposable soma” theory is another well-received theory of aging. Itproposes that organisms invest in reproduction, in offspring and in themselves,but only to the level necessary to generate healthy offspring. The soma, ourbody—which is the carrier of the genetic material contained in our sperm cellsand oocytes—is therefore disposable once it has generated a sufficient number ofoffspring. Unflattering as it sounds, under this theory we are merely disposablecarriers of DNA.Because these theories focus on the aging process and not on the potential fororganisms to stay young, fifteen years ago I came up with my own explanation ofaging: the “programmed longevity” theory.1 [chapter002_notes.xhtml#ch02-1] Iproposed that an organism could, in fact, afford a greater investment inself-protection against aging, and that this could have important implicationsfor human life and the prevention of diseases; since by altering the “longevityprogram,” we could postpone the age at which we begin to become frail and sick.Imagine, for example, moving this age from fifty to seventy. If this ispossible, you might wonder, then why did this longevity program ever becomedormant?The answer is not that it is impossible to maximize both protection andreproduction, but that the level of current protection is sufficient to carryout the task. The other reason for the program to have remained dormant is thathistorically we reproduced, or tried to reproduce, much more frequently than wedo now. So for the great majority of human history, activating a program thatreroutes so much energy away from reproduction to use for protection and repairwould not have been advantageous.Consider this analogy: Would it be possible to build a plane that could flyyears longer than current models without its performance suffering?The answer is yes. There are at least two ways to accomplish this: 1. The longer-lived plane would need more fuel and more maintenance for each mile it flies to prevent damage. 2. The longer-lived plane would require superior technology to reduce damage while using the same amount of fuel and maintenance as current models.Now let’s apply this to humans: 1. People who live longer would need more energy to perform more maintenance (DNA repair, cellular regeneration, etc.). 2. People who live longer would need to get better at utilizing energy to increase protection against aging and maintaining normal function for longer.However, there may be no evolutionary reason to do it, because for the humanspecies to continue to thrive, aging and death at eighty is perfectlyacceptable. But what if we wanted to be just a little more selfish and live anextra thirty healthy years? Is it possible to improve the protection and repairsystems to stay young longer, or even become younger? Or have we reached amaximum level of protection?I believe, and the data indicate, that we have not—that it is indeed possible toimprove the body’s protective systems or make these systems continue to worklonger so that we undergo decline and begin to encounter diseases not at ageforty to fifty but at age sixty to seventy or better yet, never encounter manyof them at all. In the following chapters I will show how genetic or dietaryinterventions can not only delay diseases but actually eliminate a major portionof chronic diseases in mice, monkeys, and even humans to extend longevity. Atthe foundation of these effects is what I called programmed longevity: abiological strategy to influence longevity and health through cellularprotection and regeneration to stay younger longer.JUVENTOLOGYDiscussions about theories of aging are great entertainment for scientists butnot much use to anyone else. Under the programmed longevity theory, how and whywe age is not as interesting as how we stay young. Because of the importance ofthis distinction, I coined a term for this area of inquiry: “juventology,” thestudy of youth. What’s the difference? A great deal.If you are trying to understand why a car ages, you might study the engine andconclude that over time it slowly rusts. To make it last longer, you might addan antioxidant additive to the fuel or motor oil. This is essentially what thefree radical theory of aging supports as a way to extend healthy longevity. Butthis is like what I said before about vitamin C and the Mozart symphony: youcan’t improve Mozart’s compositions by just adding cellos—you have to write abetter symphony. But for the sake of argument, let’s suppose that you could slowthe aging of the engine a little by adding a lot of antioxidants. This agingprocess and the small effect of the antioxidants on it becomes irrelevant,however, if the owner of the car rebuilds the engine every ten years, replacingthe damaged parts with brand-new ones.The same applies to the human body: we can try to understand how it ages andattempt to slow that down, or we can identify ways to eliminate aged componentsand periodically replace them with young ones. In this case, it doesn’t matterhow the body ages, whether by oxidation or some other mechanism. The goalchanges from protecting the body from damage to improving protection and, moreimportantly, repair and replacement/regeneration.In both cases the body ages with time, but if we can program health to lastlonger, the system will trigger protection, repair, and replacement mechanismsto maintain the organism’s vigor and functionality. This is the differencebetween the current gerontology/aging-based approach and what I think is a moreeffective juventology-based approach. It is worth keeping in mind thatprotecting the body from aging and damage is also important because we are along way from being able to repair and replace molecules, cells, and systemsperfectly. Thus, combining the gerontology and juventology approaches is ideal.Throughout this book, I will describe specific dietary changes that haveprotective, regenerating, and rejuvenating effects. As my laboratory hasdiscovered, there is a clear connection between nutrients and longevity genes,which can be activated to promote cellular reprogramming and regeneration sothat an organism can stay healthy longer and, as a consequence, maximize what wecall “healthspan,” or healthy lifespan.THE DISCOVERY OF THE AGING GENES AND NETWORKSTo keep organisms young, we must “reprogram” the “youth period” from aforty-to-fifty-year length to a sixty-to-seventy-year program or longer. Tolearn how to reprogram longevity though, I had to better understand itsmolecular mechanisms. The dietary interventions described later in the book arebased on discoveries made in part by my laboratory’s research into just this.In 1992, I came to UCLA, at that time one of the world’s leading centers oflongevity research, to devote myself to the genetics and biochemistry oflongevity. I had put my career as a rock guitarist on hold, though I did performin Los Angeles and toured on the West Coast during my first three years ofgraduate school. Perhaps influenced by the Hollywood obsession with stayingeternally young, each of the two rival research universities of the City ofAngels had attracted its own master in the field of aging: famous pathologistRoy Walford was at UCLA, and renowned neurobiologist Caleb Finch was at USC.I elected to join Walford’s group for my doctoral work. Under his watch, Istudied the effect of caloric restriction—how reducing the daily caloriesconsumed by mice and men by 30 percent every day affects their aging andlifespan. However, Roy and I spoke only via video conference because he haddecided to lock himself away for two years, along with seven other people, in asealed environment in the middle of the Arizona desert. Called Biosphere 2, thisself-imposed exile was an experiment to understand whether and how humans couldsurvive in a completely sealed environment, producing all the food they needed:a useful experiment in the responses of humans to a highly regulated environmentwith possible applications for living on space stations. I went to Arizona atthe end of the two years to welcome the eight adventurers as they came out ofBiosphere 2. As part of the experiment, they had been calorie restricted andconsumed very few calories a day for two years. When they emerged at the end ofit, they were extremely thin and looked angry.After being in Walford’s UCLA lab for two years, I still had little insight intothe secrets of aging. Mice were too complex to allow rapid identification of thegenes that regulate and affect aging. Also seeing the angry faces of theBiospherians made me think that there must be a better way than chronic calorierestriction to delay aging, and I was impatient to find it. It prompted me tomove to the biochemistry department, and the laboratory of Joan Valentine andEdith Gralla, to study aging in baker’s yeast: a simple unicellular organismthat allowed me to study the molecular foundation for life, aging, and death.We think of yeast as an ingredient in bread and beer, but Saccharomycescerevisiae (baker’s yeast) is in fact one of the most studied organisms inscience. This single-cell organism is inexpensive to work with and easy tostudy. It is so easy to work with that some scientists carry out yeastexperiments at home. It’s also easy to modify genetically, by simply removing oradding one or more of its roughly six thousand genes.image [../images/9781405933940_TheLongevityDiet_002_IMGX.jpg]2.1. Roy Walford (far right) and the Biospherians at the beginning of theexperiment, 1991A small group of scientists, including myself at UCLA and Brian Kennedy at MIT,decided the easiest way to understand how humans age is to identify the genesthat regulate the aging of simple organisms, like yeast, and eventually moveback to mice and humans. There was a big risk, however: What if our discoveriesabout how yeast ages had no relevance to humans? Most scientists studying agingin mice and humans had assumed that to be the case and were not that interestedin our research on these very simple organisms.But I had faith it would work and was determined to try; the risk was big butthe potential payoff—figuring out the molecular mechanisms of aging—was worthit. My first step was to define a new scientific approach to studying aging.Because aging in yeast was studied only by a method called “replicative aging,”which would be equivalent to studying human aging by determining the maximumnumber of children a woman could have, I developed a method called “yeastchronological life” and used it to identify a set of genes important to aging.This method allowed me to measure aging chronologically—in other words, the sameway we measure it for humans or mice—by being able to monitor every few days howmany of these microorganisms remained alive. It was 1994, and no one had everidentified a gene that regulated the aging process in any organism. Thanks tothe work of Thomas Johnson at the University of Colorado and Cynthia Kenyon atUC San Francisco, it was known that genes could make worms live longer—just notwhat genes they were or how they worked.With three Nobel laureates and seven members of the National Academy of Sciencesin the pharmacology and biochemistry departments, UCLA was science heaven. I wassurrounded by great geneticists, biochemists, and molecular biologists, allready to help. I didn’t even have to knock, because the doors—even those of theNobelists—were almost always open.Even so, we didn’t tell people we were working on aging. Although within ten tofifteen years the field would explode, back then it was considered a strange,even crazy area of study, and we were considered an odd group. When people askedwhat I was working on, I would say, “Free radical biochemistry.”After just one year I made two important discoveries using the method I hadinvented: 1. If I starved yeast—by removing all the nutrients available to them and giving them only water—they lived twice as long. 2. Sugar is one of the nutrients responsible for yeast aging fast and dying early. It activates two genes, RAS and PKA, that are known to accelerate aging, and it inactivates factors and enzymes that protect against oxidation and other types of damage.In a short period in the biochemistry department, I had identified not only thefirst gene regulating the aging process but also the entire signaling pathway,all thanks to a very simple organism.The system was so simple and so new that the scientific community was indisbelief and struggled to understand, let alone accept, the chronological agingsystem and the discovery of the pro-aging sugar pathway. Leading sciencejournals refused to publish the findings my mentors and I found soextraordinary, so I used the discoveries as the basis for my doctoral thesis, aswell as two other publications, which were ignored for several years.It wasn’t until 1996 that anyone showed any interest in my discovery. Theleading aging research at the time was being done on worms, and Tom Johnson, whowas trying to identify an unknown gene that made worms live longer, invited meto present my data on the “sugar pathway” at a conference. When my presentationended, the room was absolutely silent. The stars of the aging field, who yearslater would become my colleagues and friends, stared at me as if I had grownhorns—no one had ever heard of the system I was working with (yeastchronological aging), nor of the genes I had identified, and anyway, very fewbelieved that similar genes and strategies could be affecting aging in suchdifferent organisms.A few years later, encouraged by continuing to discover similarities between myfindings in yeast and those of the teams studying worms, which now included GaryRuvkun at Harvard, I published an article proposing that many if not allorganisms age in similar ways and that the genes and “molecular strategy” toachieve longer lifespans would be similar or the same in yeast, worms, mice,and, yes, humans.2 [chapter002_notes.xhtml#ch02-2] This was heresy, and thegreat majority of scientists dismissed it as a crazy idea with no relevance tohuman aging, since it was based on discoveries made in a microorganism.image [../images/9781405933940_TheLongevityDiet_003_IMGX.jpg]2.2. Yeast, fruit flies, and dwarf mice with similar mutations in growth genesall have record longevity.It would take another six years for our data on genes activated by sugars to getpublished, along with the discovery of the pro-aging genes activated by aminoacids and proteins (see fig. 2.2 [chapter002.xhtml#lon0003041a]).3[chapter002_notes.xhtml#ch02-3] Eight more years passed before differentlaboratories would confirm these data experimentally in mice, and another tenyears before my own lab provided initial evidence that similar genes andpathways may protect humans against age-related diseases.4[chapter002_notes.xhtml#ch02-4]Knowing that “dwarf yeast” with longevity mutations in the growth genes(TOR-S6K) could live up to five times longer than normal yeast, and that “dwarfflies and mice” with similar genetic mutations could live up to twice as long asnormal mice, in 2006 I started research on the human version of the growth geneknown to correlate to record longevity in mice (see fig. 2.2[chapter002.xhtml#lon0003041a]). Through my colleague Pinchas Cohen, who is nowdean of the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, I learned of the work ofJaime Guevara-Aguirre, an endocrinologist who had spent decades studying acommunity of extremely short people in Ecuador who lacked the receptor forgrowth hormone, a disorder known as Laron syndrome. After five years of workingtogether, we published our findings concluding that there was a major decreasein the incidence of cancer and diabetes in subjects with Laron syndrome (seefig. 2.4 [chapter002.xhtml#lon0003045s]), despite poor diet (consuming largequantities of fried food) and unhealthy lifestyle choices (smoking, drinking,etc.).5 [chapter002_notes.xhtml#ch02-5] Our finding made this group of shortindividuals from remote villages in Ecuador famous around the world—everyonewanted to hear about this group of little people who appeared to hold the secretthat could protect everyone from cancer, diabetes, and possibly other diseases.We were even invited to present our research to the Pope, accompanied by one ofour Laron subjects. Journalists described these people as being free fromdisease. “It doesn’t matter what we eat,” the Laron subjects told reporters,“because we are immune from diseases.” Of course, this is not the case; a fewhave developed both cancer and diabetes, but these diseases occur rarely, andmuch less frequently than they appear in their non-Laron relatives living in thesame houses and consuming the same food. Recently, we also published our studieson the brain function of this Laron group and concluded that they have cognitivefunction that is typical of younger individuals.6[chapter002_notes.xhtml#ch02-6] In other words, their brains appear to beyounger than they are, which is in agreement with the findings published by theAndrzej Bartke laboratory in mice with similar mutations.7[chapter002_notes.xhtml#ch02-7] After these studies and many trips to Ecuador,the country, particularly the isolated Andes to the south, became a magicalplace for me, and I go back as often as possible. Jaime and I argue all thetime, but we continue to work very closely and have forged a fruitfulfriendship.image [../images/9781405933940_TheLongevityDiet_004_IMGX.jpg]2.3. Me with Freddi Salazar Aguilar and Luis Sanchez Romero (both with Laronmutations) in their native Ecuadorimage [../images/9781405933940_TheLongevityDiet_005_IMGX.jpg]2.4. Individuals with mutations in the growth hormone receptor are protectedfrom disease.These findings were the last missing pieces to support my theory that similargenes and longevity programs can protect organisms, ranging from simple onessuch as yeast to complex ones like humans, against aging and disease. Thesealternative programs, such as those found in the Laron people, have probablyevolved to deal with periods of starvation by minimizing growth and aging, whilealso stimulating regeneration. The mutation in the growth hormone receptor genethat these Ecuadorians carry appears to force the body to enter and stay in an“alternative longevity program” characterized by high protection, regeneration,and low incidence of disease. The rest of the book takes advantage of thisgenetic knowledge to identify everyday diets and a periodic fasting-mimickingdiet that can regulate genes that protect against aging and diseases.CONNECTING NUTRIENTS, GENES, AGING, AND DISEASESA risk factor is something that affects the probability of dying from ordeveloping a particular disease. For example, obesity is a well-established riskfactor for diabetes: it can increase by fivefold the chance of developing thedisease. We think of poor nutrition, lack of exercise, and the genes we inheritfrom our parents as the major risk factors for diseases. But, by monitoring theage at which people are diagnosed with different diseases, we know that agingitself is the main risk factor for cancer, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer’s,and many other diseases. According to recent data, the probability that atwenty-year-old woman will develop breast cancer within the next ten years ofher life is roughly 1 in 2,000. The risk is 1 in 24 for a seventy-year-oldwoman—that’s an increase by almost a factor of 100.As I have stated, my approach is different from that of almost all othernutrition books, in that my program doesn’t focus on achieving a healthy weightor on any one specific disease independently of the long-term consequences of atreatment. If aging is the central risk factor for all major diseases, it’s muchsmarter to intervene on aging itself than to try to prevent and treat diseasesone by one. Even great success against one disease may be minimal or renderedirrelevant if accompanied by an increased incidence of another—few people know,for example, that curing cancer or cardiac disease today would increase theaverage lifespan by only a little over three years.The lifespan of a mouse is about two and a half years, and tumors begin toappear in mice at the age of one and a half. People live on average more thaneighty years, and most tumors begin to appear after age fifty. In relativeterms, that is a similar proportion of life. Therefore, we can reduce the riskof cancer and many other diseases by acting on the longevity program, and we nowknow that we can do this through diet.Figure 2.5 [chapter002.xhtml#lon000305s2] shows how sugars and proteins (aminoacids) affect key genes and pathways widely recognized to accelerate aging:TOR-S6K, PKA, RAS, and IGF-1. To maximize and reprogram longevity in the humanbody, we need to continue to study how different diets control these genes andthen apply the longevity program to all the diseases associated with aging. (Seechapters 7 [chapter007.xhtml] to 11 [chapter011.xhtml] for disease-specificapplications.) Clearly our strategy of studying the genetics and molecularbiology of longevity in simple organisms paid off, though it took many years ofhard work by groups made up of mostly geneticists and molecular biologists atuniversities all over the world.image [../images/9781405933940_TheLongevityDiet_006_IMGX.jpg]2.5. The regulation of aging and diseases by sugar- and protein-activatedpathwaysFROM STUDYING AGING TO SOLVING MEDICAL PROBLEMSAfter studying aging, my second passion, developed while working with Walford’sgroup at UCLA, is using the biochemistry of longevity to solve medical problems.To optimize disease prevention and treatment, we need to know what causesdisease at the molecular and cellular level and to understand how we can returnthose molecules and cells to their youthful, fully functioning states. Toattempt to treat a disease without this information is like trying to fix a carwithout knowing how its engine or electrical system works. Repairing cars andplanes is, of course, much simpler than repairing a sick human body.Although this is a generalization, much of medical research is based onidentifying drugs that can target a specific problem associated with a disease.For example, to treat cancer, researchers developed chemotherapy and other morespecific drugs that preferentially kill cancer cells; to treat multiplesclerosis and other autoimmune diseases, scientists identified proteins anddrugs that reduce the activity of specific immune cell populations or theinflammatory factors they generate. I argue that this is an incomplete approachthat is not “in tune with evolution” and that would greatly benefit from beingcombined with, and in some cases replaced by, a “longevity-based” approach,preferably one awakening a program already present in the human body, once thisis further demonstrated to be effective. For example, by starving a mousereceiving chemotherapy or other targeted therapies, we protect normal cells andorgans while making the therapy more toxic to cancer cells (see chapter 7[chapter007.xhtml]); and by applying cycles of a fasting-mimicking diet to amouse with an autoimmune disease, we reduce the number of autoimmune cells whilealso activating regeneration of the damaged tissues (see chapter 11[chapter011.xhtml]). Preliminary results indicate that these strategies may alsobe effective in humans.While I was a research scientist working at USC, I had the opportunity to meetwith children being treated for cancer at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles.Italian researcher Lizzia Raffaghello, at the time a visiting scholar in LosAngeles, was puzzled by our effort to find ways to help people live longer andhealthier lives to age one hundred and beyond, when her ward was full ofchildren who might not make it to ten.One of these patients was a girl from southern Italy. We considered isolatingher neuroblastoma cells in the laboratory, to study them and understand whattherapy might work best. But we came up against the hard reality that this typeof study was not allowed by the hospital or by my department. The girleventually returned to Italy, and sadly she died. I will never forget how shekept close watch on the intravenous saline solution bag, with the seriousnessand maturity of a nurse ensuring a procedure is being carried out correctly.Because of the impact that girl and the other sick children I’d met had on myvision of research, I decided to divide my lab between two areas of interest andtwo different missions. One team of researchers would continue to work on thebiochemistry and genetics of aging; the other would work to solve medicalproblems using strategies based on our understanding of cellular protection,repair, and regeneration with an eye toward solutions that were inexpensive andcould rapidly be translated into improved therapies. Because diet-basedtherapies do not involve new drugs, they can move through the Food and DrugAdministration approval process quickly, and in some cases can be combined withstandard-of-care drug-based therapies without FDA approval. From this effortcame our discoveries of differential stress resistance and sensitization, whichuse prolonged fasting to push normal cells into a highly protected state whilemaking cancer cells highly vulnerable to chemotherapy and other cancer therapies(see chapter 7 [chapter007.xhtml]). Other dietary strategies applicable todiabetes as well as autoimmune, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative disordersalso came from our effort to identify simple but powerful therapies for complexproblems. But before we get to the diet itself, I’ll explain how I’ve harnessedthirty years of research, both mine and that of other labs, to identify dailydiets as well as periodic fasting-mimicking diets with the potential to extendhealthy human longevity."},{"pageContent":"Penguin walking logo [../images/PCHI_1.gif]CHAPTER 3THE FIVE PILLARSTHE LONGEVITY REVOLUTIONMost popular diets and the experts behind them fail to take into considerationthe most important reason to adopt a diet in the first place: living to a veryold age and “dying healthy.” We are so used to associating death with cancer,heart disease, or another illness that the concept of “dying healthy” seemsalien. But this is the promise of the “longevity revolution.”1[chapter003_notes.xhtml#ch03-1] Indeed, the concept is now strongly supported byexperiments in simple organisms, mice, rats, monkeys, and humans. Based onbiogerontology (study of the biology of aging), preventive medicine, andlongevity research, we now know that the later years of life, even when life isextended, need not be associated with poor health and disease.For example, the mice and rats we treat in the lab with different longevitydiets live up to 40 percent longer and have far fewer diseases despite theirlonger lifespan compared to mice on standard diets. Long-term studies of monkeyson a calorie-restricted diet demonstrate a major reduction in disease incidenceas well as lifespan extension. This is consistent with our recent studyassociating high protein intake with cancer and mortality in humans. Inaddition, we discovered that, as with the long-lived mice lacking growth hormonereceptors, the Ecuadorian people with the same deficiency in the GH receptorrarely develop either diabetes or cancer and appear to be protected fromage-dependent cognitive decline and possibly other diseases. Thus, dietaryinterventions that affect particular genes or genetic changes in those genesdirectly can extend not only longevity but healthy longevity in mice, primates,and humans. According to these studies, a precise Longevity Diet accompanied byperiodic fasting-mimicking diets (which I describe in chapters 4[chapter004.xhtml] and 6 [chapter006.xhtml], respectively) can, by regulatingthe set of “longevity genes,” extend the healthy lifespan.I’ve been lucky to see this kind of healthy longevity with my own eyes. In thepast ten years, I was able to make many visits to the two oldest people inItaly: Salvatore Caruso, 110, and Emma Morano, 117, who have both now passedaway. Emma was also the oldest living person in the world, and the oldest everin Italy’s recorded history. Both retained good memory skills, engaged in manyactivities on their own into old age, and were remarkable examples of healthylongevity. Emma exemplifies the importance of genetics on longevity (her dietwasn’t particularly healthy), whereas Salvatore shows the influence of diet onhuman health. Thus, the study of people and populations with record longevityrepresents one of the key pillars I have used to identify the Longevity Dietdescribed in this book.WHO DO YOU LISTEN TO?Among the longevity factors within your control, what you eat is the primarychoice you can make that will affect whether you live to 60, 80, 100, or 110—andmore important, whether you will get there in good health. So when it comes todietary recommendations, it’s crucial to listen to the right people. In anInternet-centered world, perhaps the most dangerous development for your healthis the chaos generated by the idea that everyone can give dietary advice. It isessential to determine whether a so-called diet expert has the appropriate rangeof knowledge before deciding whether he or she is qualified to give you dietaryadvice.On a recent train ride from Milan to Genoa, I had one of many entertainingexperiences underlining that everyone believes themselves to be a diet expert.An old building administrator from Genoa explained how his wife’s omelets werethe key to maintaining his weight and health. The woman next to him protestedthat eggs have high cholesterol and that her pasta and zucchini were muchhealthier. When five such “dietary experts” had made their recommendations, theywondered why I had not jumped in.“I think you’d better cut down on the number of fried eggs per week,” I told theretired administrator.“You know, I don’t think I like you,” he replied.Because everyone eats, everyone feels he or she knows enough about food andhealth to give advice. Recently a woman asked me what I thought she and her sonshould eat to stay healthy. After hearing my advice, she responded, “I think thebest thing to do is to eat everything in moderation.”I asked her, “Would you fly on an airplane that you had personally designed?”She knew the correct answer to that question was absolutely not. Most planes aredesigned by teams of world-class engineers working at major aviation companieslike Boeing and Airbus, using technology and insights going back to the Wrightbrothers and even Leonardo da Vinci. Why would you be willing to make keydecisions that affect whether you and your loved ones will get cancer, diabetes,cardiovascular disease, and many other illnesses based on the silly idea thatone should “eat in moderation”? What does that even mean?In the class I teach on nutrition and longevity at USC, I ask my students howmany calories there are in a bagel. Most think it’s around 100 or 150 calories.In fact, most bagels provide between 250 and 500 calories, without cream cheese.When I started directing clinical trials in which participants are told exactlywhat to eat, I discovered that most people have no idea what it means to eat0.36 grams of protein per pound of body weight per day. Even experienced healthjournalists have told me, “I wasn’t sure if you meant that I should eat fiftygrams of protein or fifty grams of food that contains proteins per day.”I mean protein, not food that contains protein. This minor misunderstandingalone could cause someone to become malnourished or sick—50 grams of garbanzobeans contains only 5 grams of protein, just 10 percent of what adults need tostay healthy.I have also learned that “moderation” is relative. Consider the following dailymenu: a glass of milk, two eggs and bacon, a small steak, a slice of cheese,some carrots, some pasta, a chicken filet, a salad with ranch dressing, a pieceof cake, and two soft drinks. To many people, this represents eating inmoderation. Yet this is the type of diet that has made the United States one ofthe world leaders in obesity and related diseases. The key to adopting alongevity diet is finding books, like this one, written by scientists orclinicians who have mastered as many of the Pillars of Longevity as possible.Although most healthy people will be able to make these dietary changes on theirown, I do recommend if at all possible that you consult with a qualified medicaldoctor or registered dietitian, at least initially, and especially if you havefood allergies and might need help personalizing the diet to your needs. Youalready bought this book, so you’re on the right track.As I have said, I based the great majority of dietary recommendations in thisbook not on my opinion, but on the Five Pillars of Longevity and the solid,consistent, scientific, and clinical evidence they provide. I don’t talk about“miracle diets” or “cures,” and I stay away from fad diets promising weightloss. Changing your diet to gear it toward healthy longevity will take somework. But it will be much easier than you imagine, and in many cases it will bemore beneficial than drug therapies when you factor in both efficacy and sideeffects. Not to mention saving money on doctors and medications. In the longrun, the life-extending benefits will be well worth the effort.I’m confident in these claims because of the positive results achieved bythousands of people I have studied—either personally or through basic research,clinical trials, and genetic and epidemiological studies. I’m also confidentbecause most of my recommendations for everyday diets match the diets of thevery-long-lived populations that I, and other experts like Craig Wilcox inOkinawa, have studied. These individuals are concentrated in “blue zones,” aterm coined by Michel Poulain and Gianni Pes, and made popular by author DanBuettner, to identify longevity hot spots, where diet and physical activitylevels are believed to be a key factor in successful longevity. This book alsotakes into account dietary habits that were common in our history. For example,my disease-treatment recommendations in the later chapters of this book,specifically the fasting and fasting-mimicking diets, are based on scientificand clinical studies; but many of these interventions find echoes in ancientpractices, such as religious fasting. Historically religious fasting was notadopted to prevent or treat disease but, since it was common for our ancestorsand has now been tested on thousands of people, we know it to be generallyfeasible and safe.THE FIVE PILLARS OF LONGEVITYMost people are discouraged and often confused by nutritional news. Nutrientgroups (fats, proteins, and carbohydrates) and also specific foods like eggs andcoffee have all been described in scientific journals and the media as both goodand bad for you. How do you decide what’s right for you and your health? Infact, proteins, fats, and carbohydrates can be considered both good and bad foryou depending on type and consumption. For example, proteins are essential fornormal function, yet high levels of proteins, and particularly those from redmeat and other animal sources, have been associated with increased incidence ofseveral diseases. So we need a better system to filter out the noise and extractbeneficial dietary information.This is why I formulated the “Five Pillars of Longevity.” This method is basedon my own studies and also on the studies of many other laboratories andclinicians. It uses five research areas to determine whether a nutrient orcombination of nutrients is good or bad for health and to identify the idealcombination of foods for optimal longevity.I believe that many popular strategies and diets are inappropriate or onlypartially correct because they are based on just one or two pillars. This isimportant because while one nutrient may be protective against one condition ordisease, it can negatively affect another, or it can protect middle-ageindividuals but hurt the very young or the elderly. An example: In adults ageseventy and below, eating a relatively high-calorie diet will in most cases leadto weight gain and an increase in the risk for developing certain diseases. Yetin individuals over age seventy, the same diet and the consequent moderateweight gain can be protective against certain diseases and overall mortality.This is why it is important to follow the advice of someone who has an in-depthunderstanding of the complex relationship between nutrition, aging, and disease.The Five Pillars of Longevity create a strong foundation for dietaryrecommendations and a filtering system to evaluate thousands of studies relatedto aging and disease, while also minimizing the burden of dietary change. Whendietary choices are based on all the Five Pillars, they are unlikely to becontradicted or undergo major alterations as a consequence of new findings.image [../images/9781405933940_TheLongevityDiet_007_IMGX.jpg]3.1. The Five Pillars of LongevityTHE FIVE PILLARS OF LONGEVITY: * Basic/juventology research. Without understanding how nutrients—such as proteins and sugars—affect cellular function, aging, age-dependent damage, and regeneration, it is difficult to determine the type and quantity of nutrients needed to optimize healthy longevity. Without animal studies to determine whether a diet can in fact extend longevity, in addition to having acute effects on general health, it is difficult to translate the basic discoveries to human interventions. As I mentioned earlier, I first started working with mice and humans in Walford’s lab, but I soon discovered that a far simpler unicellular organism, yeast, could help us identify the fundamental properties of organisms. These could then be applied to humans, furnishing information related to molecular aspects of longevity—in particular, the ones linked to evolutionary principles. Using yeast, we were able to generate the differential stress resistance and sensitization theories that served as the foundation for a number of clinical trials testing the effect of fasting-mimicking diets in combination with cancer therapies. This basic/juventology research is where every one of our studies begins. * Epidemiology. This is the study of the causes and important risk factors for disease and other health-related conditions in defined populations. Studying population-based risk factors is crucial to testing hypotheses generated by basic research. For example, if you hypothesize that excess sugar promotes abdominal fat storage and resistance to insulin, epidemiological research should confirm that people who consume high quantities of sugars have a high waist circumference and an increased risk for diabetes. After my initial focus on the genetics of aging and juventology, I carried out epidemiological studies related to aging and diseases, which taught me the tremendous value of understanding the health consequences of behavior in large populations. * Clinical studies. Hypotheses formulated in basic and epidemiological studies eventually must be tested in randomized, controlled clinical trials. This is the gold standard to demonstrate efficacy. For example, a group of pre-diabetic subjects would be instructed to consume fewer sugars but otherwise maintain the same diet and calorie intake as before. The control group would be asked to maintain the same diet or reduce the intake of fat to match the calorie reduction in the reduced-sugar group. Understanding the importance of this pillar grew out of my own randomized clinical trials, and those of many others, testing the effect of a particular dietary component on risk factors for disease, such as cholesterol or fasting glucose levels, but also on a disease itself, such as cardiovascular disease. * Centenarian studies. Once the data from basic/juventology, epidemiological, and clinical studies are available, there is still uncertainty about whether a specific diet or nutritional indication is in fact safe and beneficial after long-term use, and whether it is palatable enough for people not just to adopt it but to stick with it for the rest of their lives. Studies of various centenarian populations from around the world provide long-term evidence of the safety, efficacy, and compliance associated with a particular diet (for example, a low-sugar diet). To generate data for the fourth pillar, I have studied long-lived populations in Ecuador and southern Italy and consulted the work of my colleagues focusing on other very long-lived populations in high-longevity zones around the world. * Studies of complex systems. This pillar is the result of my fascination with reductionism, physics, and the need to simplify the human body’s complexity by identifying machines that can serve as models to teach us about the function and loss of function of human organs and systems. This last pillar can complement the others by providing reference points and useful analogies. For example, above I discuss how sugars can lead to disease. But sugars are also the most important nutrient for the human body. Sugar is to the body what gasoline is to a car—the central source of energy. So sugar is not the problem. It’s the intake of excessive quantities of sugar, in combination with proteins and certain types of fats, that contributes to disease both directly and indirectly—by activating aging-related genes, creating insulin resistance, and triggering hyperglycemia. This last pillar furthers the analysis of a human problem by taking an engineering approach to generate a relatively simple model to understand the complex interactions between food, cellular damage, and aging.APPLYING THE FIVE PILLARS OF LONGEVITYAs an example of how to apply the Five Pillars to analyze a diet’s efficacy,let’s examine the very popular high-protein, high-fat, and low-carb diet, suchas the Atkins and Dukan diets. Should you go on this diet just because an“expert” told you that a small clinical trial or even a large epidemiologicalstudy shows that it causes weight loss and may lower cholesterol? The answer isdefinitely not, since when you analyze these diets, they are often based on justone or two pillars, rarely taking into account the entire foundation needed tosupport the selection of a diet that will optimize health and longevity. Theseare the diets that tend to get debunked over time. When you look atmultidisciplinary studies, you realize that the high-protein,high-saturated-fat, and low-carb diet is one of the worst for your health.Populations with record longevity do not eat this way, and theoretical,clinical, and epidemiological studies supporting this kind of diet’s long-termand longevity benefits are very few. Also, if we examine the laboratory studies,we see that both high protein intake and high saturated fat intake areassociated with aging and disease, an additional and key vote against ahigh-protein, high-saturated-fat diet.As you can see, even when a diet is touted as having been clinically studied, itdoesn’t mean that it has been studied as rigorously as necessary, so it isalways wise to hesitate before adopting a new diet, and to look into how many ofthe Five Pillars it is based on. As we have shown in both our human and mousestudies, one diet fits most but does not fit all, and the levels of some dietarycomponents must be modified depending on a person’s age and physical state andbased on his or her genes. In my laboratory, we treat food as a complex mixtureof molecules—each capable of causing remarkable changes in your body, which isits own complex mixture of molecules.If it already sounds confusing or difficult to follow, don’t worry, I will makeit as simple as possible in chapter 4 [chapter004.xhtml]."},{"pageContent":"Penguin walking logo [../images/PCHI_1.gif]CHAPTER 4THE LONGEVITY DIETYOU ARE WHAT YOU EATWe all know the saying “You are what you eat.” For most people, that translatesto “avoid junk food.” But this popular expression reflects a deeper truth. Thefood you eat can determine how you look and function, whether you sleep well atnight, whether you will stay thin or gain weight, and whether your body shape ismore like a pear or an apple. The type of food you eat determines whether yourbrain will use glucose or ketone bodies to obtain energy; and if you’re a woman,the type and quantity of food you eat can affect your chances of becomingpregnant. It’s important to eat food you truly enjoy, but it’s also important toeliminate or minimize the consumption of food that will make your life shorterand sicker, and to increase the consumption of nutrients that will make yourlife longer and healthier.Many ingredients aren’t just food; they’re actually molecules causing remarkablechanges in the body—changes in their levels and combinations can reprogram thefunction of our cells and organs. As mentioned earlier, I call the understandingand use of food combinations to control these changes “nutritechnology.” In thischapter, I will describe briefly what these ingredients are and what they do.Then I will explain their role in aging and disease, based on evidence using theFive Pillars of Longevity. I will also focus on the enjoyability of food—animportant consideration that can determine how likely someone is to continuewith a certain diet.PROTEINS, CARBOHYDRATES, FATS, AND MICRONUTRIENTSThere are three major components—what we call macronutrients—in the food we eat. 1. Proteins are generally composed of twenty amino acids, whose sequence determines their particular function. For example, a 3-ounce steak contains approximately 25 grams of protein. One of the most abundant proteins in meat is actin, which is involved in muscle contraction and many other cellular functions. After meat is eaten, the digestive system breaks it down into protein and then into amino acids. These amino acids are released first in the stomach and subsequently in the intestine. They are absorbed into the bloodstream as single amino acids or chains of multiple amino acids. Eventually, amino acids are distributed to different cell types throughout the body, where they are used to generate new proteins, including the actin found in human muscle. 2. Carbohydrates are found in most foods you eat, either in their simple form (the sugars in fruit juices, honey, candy, or soft drinks) or in their complex form (the large chains of glucose and other sugars contained in vegetables or grains). Simple sugar can enter circulation immediately, increase blood glucose levels, and trigger the rapid release of insulin by the pancreas. Complex carbohydrates must be separated from other components in food and broken down into simple sugars before they can be absorbed by the body. When analyzing a food’s nutritional value in terms of its carbohydrates and their quality, there are a couple of different measures. You’ve probably heard the terms “glycemic index” and “glycemic load.” Glycemic index refers to the effect of a particular food on the levels of blood glucose. Orange juice has a glycemic index of about 50; white bread has an index of 95; a pure glucose drink has an index of 100. However, glycemic index assumes that you are eating a standard portion of carbohydrates. Glycemic load is a more useful measurement because it reveals information about both the characteristics of a specific carbohydrate and its quantity. For example, whole-wheat bread has a high glycemic index (71) but a slice of whole bread has a relatively low glycemic load (9). Compare that to sponge cake, with its relatively low glycemic index (46) but higher glycemic load (17). You should be more concerned about the glycemic load, since it takes into account both the quality and quantity of sugars a food contains.1 [chapter004_notes.xhtml#ch04-1] 3. Fats are the major source of stored energy in the body, in humans as well as in other mammals and simpler organisms. Modified fat molecules also play other key roles in the cells that make up the body, such as a central role in generating the membrane that separates all cell content from the blood, and in generating hormones, including steroids. Fats are mostly ingested in the form of triglycerides, which are composed of three chains of carbon and hydrogen molecules (fatty acids) bound together by a molecule of glycerol. After digestion, they are broken down in the intestine by bile salts, released from the gallbladder, and by lipase enzymes released from the pancreas and other organs so they can be absorbed into the blood. Fats can be saturated (when the maximum number of hydrogen atoms are bound to each carbon) or unsaturated (when fewer than the maximum number of hydrogen atoms are bound to each carbon). The unsaturated fats can be divided into monounsaturated fats (such as the oleic acid contained in olive oil) or polyunsaturated fats (such as those contained in salmon and corn oil). The polyunsaturated fats omega-3 and omega-6 are called “essential fatty acids” because the human body cannot generate them, but they are essential for the normal function of cells and organs.In addition to these three major macronutrients, micronutrients are an essentialcomponent of nutrition. Micronutrients, such as vitamins and minerals, accountfor much of the $37 billion US supplement industry. Yet studies by nutritionexpert Dr. Bruce Ames and others show that between 50 and 90 percent of USadults do not get enough vitamin D, E, magnesium, vitamin A, calcium, potassium,or vitamin K. At the same time, several recent articles indicate that dietarysupplements containing excess vitamins and minerals are ineffective inpreventing major diseases and delaying mortality.2[chapter004_notes.xhtml#ch04-2] One possible exception: a large, randomized,controlled trial reported a minor reduction in cancer and cataracts in peopletaking daily multivitamins.3 [chapter004_notes.xhtml#ch04-3]Though supplementation with high levels of vitamins and minerals may not protectagainst aging or diseases, we know they are important for many essentialfunctions of the human body. For example, vitamin D, zinc, and iron areimportant for normal immune function. Calcium and vitamin D are essential inmaintaining normal bone-mineral density.A diet rich in vegetables, fish, nuts, and whole grains is the ideal way to getthe essential nutrients, but even such diets can be deficient in vitamin D and,for vegans and the elderly, vitamin B12. Most people throughout the world whoare consuming what is thought of as a high-nourishment diet have similardeficiencies. Because some studies have indicated that high doses of certainvitamins can be toxic, the ideal recommendation, based on the opinion of bothsupporters and opponents of supplement use, is to take a multivitamin, made by areputable company, that contains at least vitamin D, E, magnesium, vitamin A,calcium, potassium, or vitamin K, every two to three days.As I explained in chapter 3 [chapter003.xhtml], looking for common denominatorsin support of a given supplement’s benefit will ensure that you don’t adopt adietary practice that may later be proved unhealthy. It’s possible that in thefuture, some vitamins or supplements will turn out to have benefits for someaspects of longevity and health, while others may be detrimental. By reducingthe supplementation frequency to relatively low doses and two or three times perweek, we minimize the chance of a toxic effect while still avoidingmalnourishment due to a lack of a particular vitamin or mineral.TREAT AGING: ONE HUNDRED AT FIFTY? OR FIFTY AT ONE HUNDRED?Nutrition is clearly the most important factor you can take control of to affecthow long you live, whether you will be diagnosed with certain major diseases,and whether you will be active and strong or sedentary and frail in old age.A recent paper examined nearly a thousand men and women who were thirty-eightyears old.4 [chapter004_notes.xhtml#ch04-4] It found that, in terms of theirbiological condition, some seemed no older than thirty while others appearedcloser to sixty. Furthermore, all those who were biologically older than theirtrue age would continue to age quickly in later years. My students are surprisedwhen I say some centenarians are healthier—and in some ways, younger—than peoplewho are fifty. Clearly this is limited to very few people and certain organs orsystems, but it underlines the relative value of knowing someone’s chronologicalage. Maybe one day we will determine how old someone is based not on the year heor she was born, but on his or her biological age, which we are starting to beable to accurately measure.image [../images/9781405933940_TheLongevityDiet_008_IMGX.jpg]4.1. Comparison of the potential extension of longevity obtained treatingcancer, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes and delaying aging (with diet,etc.)In the remainder of this chapter, I take advantage of the Five Pillars ofLongevity to postpone aging and prevent disease by awakening the body’s dormantability to heal, protect, regenerate, and rejuvenate itself.“I WOULD RATHER DIE YOUNG THAN HAVE TO EAT LIKE THAT.”When I talk about the Longevity Diet, someone usually makes some variation ofthe following comment: “I would rather die young than have to eat like that.”It reminds me of the joke about the man who asks his doctor how he can livelonger. The doctor recommends he eat very little, give up alcohol, and stophaving sex.“Are you sure it will work?” the man asks.“I don’t really know,” the doctor replies, “but no matter how long you live, itwill seem an eternity!”Fortunately, the Longevity Diet isn’t that restrictive. It allows you to enjoycoffee and alcohol—and puts no limit on sex. Contrary to what you might expect,it often requires that you eat more, not less. As I will describe in detail inchapter 8 [chapter008.xhtml], a plate of pasta and cheese can weigh just 12ounces and be very unhealthy, full of bad-quality calories. Or it can weigh morethan double that amount, about 1.5 pounds, and be very healthy, full ofhigh-quality calories—provided you cut down the pasta and cheese to modestportions and add plenty of vegetables and legumes and a generous splash of oliveoil.With food, as with most things, people assume anything they want and more of itwill make them happier, but that’s an illusion. In one of the best TED talksI’ve seen, Harvard professor Daniel Gilbert compares the happiness of two groupsof people: one group had won the lottery; the other was made up of people whohad become paraplegic. A year after the life-changing events occurred, bothgroups were equally happy. In the same way, one’s happiness is largelyindependent of diet. Adopting a diet that promotes a long, healthy lifespan,contrary to what the doctor in the joke says, doesn’t make life an unbearableeternity. In fact, I argue that healthier diets can be superior in taste, sincevegetables, legumes, nuts, olive oil, and other plant-based foods provide a muchwider variety of ingredients and flavors, compared with unhealthy food rich insaturated fats and sugars that obscure natural flavor. I think of the diet highin saturated fat, red meat, fried food, and cheese as equivalent to the sugarydrinks most of us consumed when we were children. Eventually, we grew up andstarted enjoying red wine instead, yet many of us never abandoned the unhealthyfood. But it’s never too late.CALORIE RESTRICTION: MICE, MONKEYS, AND HUMANSIn chapter 2 [chapter002.xhtml], I described how mice with defects in the growthhormone receptor gene can live up to 50 percent longer than those in the controlgroup, and half of them will not develop detectable diseases. I also describedhow Ecuadorians with defects in the same gene rarely develop diabetes or cancerand appear to have reduced incidence of other diseases. High protein intake, asI explained, causes the activation of the growth hormone receptor, which in turnincreases the levels of insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), whosealtered concentrations are associated with diabetes and cancer, respectively.Proteins and certain amino acids derived from them, including leucine, canactivate TOR-S6K, a set of genes that accelerate aging. Another gene thatappears to play a key role in aging is PKA, which we have shown in both simpleorganisms and mice to be activated by sugars. Mice with reduced PKA activitylive longer and are protected against age-related disease.5[chapter004_notes.xhtml#ch04-5]By reducing calorie intake, particularly reducing calories from proteins andsugars, you can decrease the activities of the growth hormone receptor, and thusof the TOR-S6K and PKA genes known to accelerate aging. These findings representthe “basic/juventology research” pillar, necessary to establish how nutrientsact on the aging process.As a consequence of not recognizing the connection between proteins and sugarsand aging, we have seen the rise over the past thirty years of high-sugar andhigh-protein diets that have been erroneously labeled “healthy.” We are startingto accept that a high-sugar diet is unhealthy. Unfortunately, many are turningto proteins, and in some cases to bad fats, as replacements for sugar. Instead,they should be turning to healthier complex carbohydrates and good fats, as Iwill explain later in this chapter.Which diets improve longevity? We have known for nearly one hundred years thatwhen mice are fed about 30 to 40 percent fewer calories, they live longer anddevelop half the tumors and other diseases when compared to the groups of micereceiving a normal-calorie diet. (An equivalent reduction in a human diet wouldleave a six-foot-tall man weighing about 130 pounds.) However, since thatdiscovery was made, it’s also become clear through multiple further studies ofmice and monkeys that chronic caloric restriction can also take a toll. As Imentioned, when I saw my first PhD adviser Roy Walford and the other sevencalorie-restricted individuals upon their exit from Biosphere 2 in Arizona, theylooked terrible; and as it turns out, those nearly two years of calorierestriction may have cut Walford’s life short. He died twelve years later ofcomplications from Lou Gehrig’s disease, which many speculate may have beenlinked to a combination of stress, calorie restriction, and advanced age.So, on the one hand we know that chronic caloric restriction can have profoundlybeneficial effects on risk factors for many diseases. On the other hand, we knowthat chronic and extreme diets—diets that reduce calories by 20 percent or moreand are maintained for long periods or permanently—can negatively affectnecessary processes, including wound healing, immune response, andcold-temperature tolerance. Put simply, besides making a person extremely thin,the detrimental effects of chronic calorie restriction appear to minimize itsbenefits by causing a major increase in other types of diseases and conditionsthat are less well understood. The focus of the rest of this book is on how toobtain the remarkable beneficial effects of calorie restriction without thenegative ones.THE LONGEVITY DIETWhat follows is the optimal diet for minimizing disease and maximizing a healthylifespan based on the Five Pillars. * Follow a pescetarian diet. Aim for a diet that is close to 100 percent plant- and fish-based, limiting fish consumption to two or three portions a week and avoiding fish with high mercury content (tuna, swordfish, mackerel, halibut). If you are past age sixty-five and start to lose muscle mass, strength, and weight, introduce more fish into the diet, along with other animal-based foods commonly consumed by populations with record longevity, like eggs and certain cheeses (preferably feta or pecorino) and yogurt made from goat’s milk, all of which are commonly consumed in high-longevity areas. * Consume low but sufficient proteins. Consume 0.31 to 0.36 grams of protein per pound of body weight per day. If you weigh 130 pounds, that comes to about 40 to 47 grams of protein per day, of which 30 grams should be consumed in a single meal to maximize muscle synthesis. If you weigh 200 to 220 pounds and have 35 percent body fat or higher, 60 to 70 grams of protein per day is sufficient, since fat cells require lower levels of protein than muscles. Since this minimum requirement can change from person to person, it is preferable to occasionally consult a dietitian, to make sure that a healthy, lean body mass is maintained. Protein intake should be increased slightly after age sixty-five in individuals who are losing weight and muscle. For most people, a 10 to 20 percent increase (5 to 10 grams more per day) is sufficient. Finally, the diet should be free of animal proteins (red meat, white meat, cheese) with the exception of proteins from fish, but relatively high in vegetable proteins (legumes, nuts, etc.) to minimize the former’s negative effects on diseases and maximize the latter’s nourishing effects. * Minimize bad fats and sugars, and maximize good fats and complex carbs. Part of the confusion and constantly changing recommendations around diet stem from the oversimplification of food components and their categorization into fats, carbs, or proteins. Every day we hear about “low carb versus high carb” or “low fat versus high fat.” It shouldn’t be a question of either/or, but of which type and how much of each. In fact, your diet should be rich in good unsaturated fats, such as those found in olive oil, salmon, almonds, and walnuts, but as low as possible in saturated, hydrogenated, and trans fats. Likewise, the diet should be rich in complex carbohydrates, such as those provided by whole bread, legumes, and vegetables, but low in sugars and limited in pasta, rice, bread, fruit, and fruit juices, which are easily converted into sugars by the time they reach the intestine. * Be nourished. You can think of the human body as an army of cells always at war. The enemy includes oxygen and other molecules that damage DNA and cells; bacteria; and viruses, which are constantly trying to defeat the immune system. Like an army in need of rations, ammunition, and equipment, the body needs proteins, essential fatty acids (omega-3, omega-6), minerals, vitamins, and, yes, sufficient levels of sugar to fight the many battles raging inside and outside cells. When your intake of certain nutrients becomes too low, the body’s repair, replacement, and defense systems slow down or stop, allowing the damage to accumulate or fungi, bacteria, and viruses to proliferate. (The appendixes include a list of foods rich in each of the important nutrients, as well as sample weekly diets that meet established nutritional targets.) As extra insurance, take a multivitamin and mineral pill, plus an omega-3 fish oil soft gel every two or three days. Purchase these products only from reputable companies, where quality control ensures appropriate supplement content and stability. * Eat a variety of foods from your ancestry. To take in all the required nutrients, you need to eat a wide variety of foods, and it’s best to choose from foods that were common on your parents’, grandparents’, and great-grandparents’ table. This does not mean you should eat like your grandparents, but that within the guidelines of this book, you should pick foods your grandparents ate. The human body is the result of billions of years of evolution, and even the last one thousand years have helped filter out people not fit for a particular environment, or foods not appropriate for a particular genotype (the collection of all genes in a person). For example, in many northern European countries where milk was commonly consumed, intolerance to lactose (the sugar contained in milk) is relatively rare, whereas lactose intolerance is very common in southern European and Asian countries, where milk was not historically part of the traditional diet of adults. If a person of Japanese ancestry living in the United States suddenly decides to start drinking milk, which was probably rarely served at her grandparents’ table, she will likely start getting sick. Whether it’s lactose or kale, quinoa or turmeric (curcumin), you have to ask whether these were foods common at the table when you, your parents, or your grandparents were growing up. If not, it’s best to avoid them or consume them only occasionally. The potential problems are intolerances (for example, an inability to break down the lactose sugar in milk) or autoimmunities, such as the reaction to gluten-rich foods like bread and pasta observed in people with celiac disease. Although clear links have not been proved yet, it is possible that consumption of the wrong foods based on ancestry could be associated with many autoimmune disorders, including Crohn’s disease, colitis, and type 1 diabetes. * Eat twice a day plus a snack. Unless your waist circumference and body weight are in the normal or low range, it is best to eat breakfast and one major meal plus a nourishing low-calorie, low-sugar snack daily. If your weight or muscle mass is too low or if it’s dropping against your will, then eat three meals a day plus a snack. One of the major mistakes of guidelines on nutrition is blurring the line between what theoretically could work and what actually does work. We often hear that we should eat small meals five to six times a day. Aside from a lack of evidence supporting the benefit of such a regimen in terms of a long and healthy lifespan, it is extremely difficult for most people to regulate food intake when they are told to eat so often. Even if the meals contain 305 calories each, instead of the recommended 300 calories, that extra 30 calories a day, or more than 900 calories a month, means nearly 3 pounds of extra fat every year. Not surprisingly, over the past twenty years—the period when the six-meal diet was popular—America reached a record 70 percent portion of overweight and obese people. If you eat only two and a half meals a day, with only one major meal, it becomes much harder to overeat, particularly on a mostly plant-based diet. It would take large portions of fish, beans, and vegetables to get to the calorie level that would cause obesity. The high nourishment of the food, plus the volume of the meal, signals to your stomach and brain that you have had enough food. * In the elderly, this one major meal system may have to be broken down into two smaller meals to avoid digestion problems. Older people and adults prone to weight loss should stick to eating three meals a day plus one snack. For people trying to lose weight or those who tend to be heavy, the best nutritional advice is to eat breakfast daily; have lunch or dinner, but not both; and substitute for the missed meal one snack containing fewer than 100 calories and no more than 3 to 5 grams of sugar. (Do not skip breakfast, as this has been associated with increased risk for age-related diseases in multiple studies.) Which meal you skip depends on your lifestyle. The advantage to skipping lunch is more free time and more energy. On the other hand, there is the possible disadvantage of restless sleep from having consumed a large dinner, particularly for those who suffer from acid reflux. The disadvantage to skipping dinner is that it eliminates the most social meal of the day. * Observe time-restricted eating. Another common practice adopted by many centenarian groups is time-restricted eating, or confining all meals and snacks to within eleven to twelve hours or less a day. The efficiency of this method has been demonstrated in both animal and human studies.6 [chapter004_notes.xhtml#ch04-6] Typically you would eat breakfast after 8 a.m. and finish dinner before 8 p.m. A shorter eating window (of ten hours or less) can be even more effective for weight loss, but it is much harder to maintain and may increase the risk of side effects, such as developing gallstones and possibly increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease. You should also not eat within three to four hours of going to sleep. * Practice periodic prolonged fasting: People under age sixty-five who are neither frail nor malnourished and are free of major diseases should undergo two periods of five days a year in which they consume a relatively high-calorie fasting-mimicking diet, or FMD. Most religious groups—including Muslims, Christians, Jews, and Buddhists—have practiced some form of fast, though some of these practices have been modified or abandoned over time. Muslims practice fasting during the month of Ramadan, but in modern times the daytime fast is often accompanied by overeating at night. During Lent, Christians used to undergo a month of severe calorie restriction ending in a week of fasting, but this practice, too, has largely been abandoned today. In chapter 6 [chapter006.xhtml], I discuss the remarkable effects of five-day cycles of a fasting-mimicking diet on disease risk factors and the optimization of healthy longevity. * Follow the eight points above in such a way that you reach and maintain a healthy weight and abdominal circumference. In a longitudinal study of 359,000 European adults followed over ten years, high waist circumference and abdominal fat were associated with increased diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, and heart disease. Having a waist circumference of more than 40 inches in men and 35 inches in women doubled the risk of premature death, compared with having a waist circumference of less than 33 inches in men and 27 inches in women. Following the eight points above will allow you to reach and maintain low visceral fat, and a healthy weight and abdominal circumference.For most people, the Longevity Diet can be adopted simply by replacing a limitednumber of items with foods that are just as enjoyable, if not more so. Virtuallyall diets fail because they are too extreme to maintain in the long run. Theyalso fail because they require major changes to your habits and lifestyle. Forexample, many new diets require low carbohydrate intake, but carbohydrates arethe food people around the world enjoy the most—whether it’s potatoes fornorthern Europeans, pasta for Italians and Americans, or rice for Asians. Thus,very low-carbohydrate diets, besides being associated with increased mortalityand reduced lifespan, are not sustainable in the long run for most people.Because the Longevity Diet is closer to diets generally adopted by Americans,Europeans, and Asians, it can be embraced by people all over the world.In the following sections I explain how the above dietary recommendations arerooted in the Five Pillars of Longevity, since this is the key to understandingtheir effectiveness. I discuss studies of the laboratories I direct, as well asthose of other laboratories and clinics.PILLAR 1: BASIC/JUVENTOLOGY RESEARCHIt is difficult to perform studies on specific human diets in mice and othersimple organisms. However, basic research yields a fundamental understanding ofthe connection between food components, aging, and disease. For example, we knowthat proteins (amino acids) consistently accelerate aging in most organisms,including yeast, flies, and mice. We also know that IGF-1 and TOR-S6K, both ofwhich are increased or activated by protein intake, are central promoters ofaging and age-related diseases in mice.7 [chapter004_notes.xhtml#ch04-7] In arecent study testing many combinations of food components, mice given alow-protein, high-carbohydrate diet lived the longest but also displayedimproved health. Mice on a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet lived theshortest and had the worst health, despite the effect of the diet on weight loss(see fig. 4.2 [chapter004.xhtml#lon0000056s]).8 [chapter004_notes.xhtml#ch04-8]In our recent study, we showed that simply by lowering protein intake in mice,we can reduce the incidence of melanoma and breast cancer.9[chapter004_notes.xhtml#ch04-9] Even after tumors were established, their rateof growth slowed in the presence of reduced protein intake. Data from studies inmice and simple organisms also support the role of time-restricted feeding andperiodic prolonged fasting in lifespan extension and reductions in age-relateddisease.10 [chapter004_notes.xhtml#ch04-10] Recently we also showed that highsugar levels make heart cells and mice more sensitive to damage and death duringchemotherapy, confirming our hypothesis that sugar makes cells more vulnerableto damage.11 [chapter004_notes.xhtml#ch04-11] Thus basic/juventology researchsupports the pro-aging role of proteins and sugars.PILLAR 2: EPIDEMIOLOGYMost large-population studies show an association between longevity and diseaseprevention, and a diet that is low in protein; largely plant- and fish-based;and rich in complex carbohydrates, olive oil, and nuts. For example, ourepidemiological study of six thousand Americans suggested that consuming ahigh-protein diet is associated with increased levels of the pro-aging growthfactor IGF-1 (see fig. 4.3 [chapter004.xhtml#lon0000057s]), a 75 percentincreased risk of overall mortality, and a three- to fourfold increased risk incancer mortality compared with consuming the low-protein and plant-based dietrecommended here (see fig. 4.4 [chapter004.xhtml#lon0000059s]).12[chapter004_notes.xhtml#ch04-12] Contrary to the findings of T. Colin Campbellin The China Study, which advocates consuming low levels of plant-based proteinsthroughout life, the beneficial effect of a low-protein diet seems to apply onlybefore age sixty-five (fig. 4.3 [chapter004.xhtml#lon0000057s]). A Harvard studyof nearly 130,000 doctors and nurses also indicates that a low-carb diet high inanimal fat and protein is associated with increases in overall cancer andcardiovascular disease mortality, a finding that is in agreement with ourresearch.13 [chapter004_notes.xhtml#ch04-13] In line with our previous proteinstudy, a follow-up study of the same group followed by Harvard University, inwhich I acted as a co-author, showed that consumption of high levels of animalbut not plant-based proteins was associated with increased mortality fromcardiovascular disease.14 [chapter004_notes.xhtml#ch04-14] A similar study offorty thousand men suggests that a low-carb, high-animal-protein diet isassociated with a twofold increase in diabetes, a finding also consistent withour discovery in the six-thousand-person protein study.15[chapter004_notes.xhtml#ch04-15] A number of other epidemiological studiesconsistently associate high IGF-1 levels in the bloodstream with an increase oftwofold or more in the incidence of breast, prostate, and other cancer types.16[chapter004_notes.xhtml#ch04-16] Because we know that protein consumption is thekey regulator of IGF-1 levels and that animal-protein intake is usuallyassociated with intake of saturated animal fats, these studies bolster the casefor a link between cancer, diabetes, and high protein and saturated fat intake.Epidemiological studies also support the key role of nourishment in diseaseprevention, since populations with deficiencies in certain vitamins have beenshown to have an increased incidence for a variety of diseases. For example,vitamin D deficiency has been associated with an increased risk for diabetes andautoimmune and cardiovascular diseases.17 [chapter004_notes.xhtml#ch04-17]PILLAR 3: CLINICAL STUDIESAs I’ve indicated, the gold standard for demonstrating the effect of a foodcomponent or diet on longevity and diseases is direct testing in a randomized,controlled clinical trial. Subjects are randomly assigned to either a groupconsuming a control diet (not believed to have an effect on health) or anexperimental diet (expected to have a health benefit). A large randomized studyto test a longevity diet against a standard diet has not been performed, but weare currently starting several trials aimed at achieving this goal. However,several existing studies do support the recommendations given above. Forexample, we have shown that even periodic use of a low-protein, plant-based dietcan reduce many markers or risk factors for aging and diseases in subjects agestwenty to seventy. (See chapter 6 [chapter006.xhtml] on fasting andfasting-mimicking diets.) A research group in Spain has randomized people atrisk for cardiovascular diseases to either a “healthy low-fat diet” or a dietrich in olive oil or nuts. A Mediterranean diet with high levels of olive oil or30 grams a day of nuts (walnuts, hazelnuts, almonds) was associated with reducedcardiovascular events and mortality.18 [chapter004_notes.xhtml#ch04-18] Theprotective role of nuts is also supported by an analysis of many studiesinvestigating their effect on the prevention of multiple diseases.19[chapter004_notes.xhtml#ch04-19] Another set of clinical trials clearlydemonstrates that protein intake is associated with high levels of IGF-1, thussupporting the link between proteins, IGF-1, aging, and cancer.image [../images/9781405933940_TheLongevityDiet_009_IMGX.jpg]4.2. Low protein and high carbohydrate consumption produces maximum longevityand health in mice.image [../images/9781405933940_TheLongevityDiet_010_IMGX.jpg]4.3. High levels of IGF-1 (growth factor pro-aging and cancer) are seen only inpeople with high consumption of protein before age sixty-five.Although it was not a randomized clinical trial, Satchidananda Panda and hiscolleagues at the Salk Institute studied how the total number of hours that foodis consumed daily and when that food is eaten are associated with sleep patternsand risk factors for diseases. They determined that people who consumed foodover a period of twelve hours or more benefited from reducing the consumptiontimespan to twelve hours or less.20 [chapter004_notes.xhtml#ch04-20] In supportof a diet high in complex carbohydrates and good fats being the best even forweight management, when a diet very low in carbohydrates (less than 10 percentof calories) and high in protein (more than 20 percent of calories) and fats wascompared with a moderate carbohydrate regimen similar to the Okinawan diet, fatloss was similar in both cases.21 [chapter004_notes.xhtml#ch04-21] However, thelow-carbohydrate diet caused a much higher loss of water and proteins,indicating that the seemingly large effect of very low-carb diets on weight lossactually represents loss of water and muscle in addition to fat.image [../images/9781405933940_TheLongevityDiet_011_IMGX.jpg]4.4. High consumption of protein before age sixty-five is associated with a 75percent increase in risk of death and a fourfold increase in risk of death fromcancer.PILLAR 4: CENTENARIAN STUDIESAreas of the world known to have the highest prevalence of centenarians—Okinawa,Japan; Loma Linda, California; small towns in Calabria and Sardinia, Italy; andin Costa Rica and Greece—all share diets that are (1) mostly plant-based withlots of nuts and some fish; (2) low in proteins, sugars, and saturated/transfats; and (3) high in complex carbohydrates coming from beans and otherplant-based foods. Most of these centenarians ate only two or three times a day,ate light meals in the evening, and were in many cases done eating before dark.They also consumed a limited variety of foods—ones typical of their homelands.In some cases they did modify their diet. For example, Okinawans used to getmost of their calories from sweet purple potatoes, but today that is far lesscommon.OKINAWACraig Wilcox and his colleagues have compared the dietary habits of typicalolder people from Okinawa with those of older citizens living in the UnitedStates.As we can see, American seniors ate ten times more meat, poultry, and eggs andthree times more fruit, but far less fish, half the vegetables, and one third ofthe grains that the Okinawans did.image [../images/9781405933940_TheLongevityDiet_012_IMGX.jpg]4.5. Dietary habits of Okinawans versus Americans. Willcox, BJ. et al. “CaloricRestriction, the Traditional Okinawan Diet, and Healthy Aging,” Annals of theNew York Academy of Science, 2007.image [../images/9781405933940_TheLongevityDiet_013_IMGX.jpg]4.6. Risk of hormone-associated cancers (1990s, taken from Okinawa Program).Willcox BJ, et al. The Okinawa Program, Harmony, 2002.In figure 4.7 [chapter004.xhtml#lon0000148s], we see that far fewer Okinawanshave cancer or cardiovascular disease than do Americans or even other people inJapan.In terms of brain aging and disease, Wilcox and his colleagues report a 30 to 50percent reduction in the prevalence of dementia in Okinawans of different agescompared with that in people of the same age in the United States.Other than diet, what makes Okinawans so long-lived? Wilcox and his colleaguesbelieve that physical activity is a key factor for their longevity and health.These activities range from gardening to martial arts to dancing. I observedsimilar high exercise behavior in elderly individuals when I visited three otherzones with high longevity: Loma Linda, California, Sardinia and Calabria, bothin Italy. I go into more detail on the connection between exercise and healthylongevity in chapter 5 [chapter005.xhtml].Wilcox and his colleagues also report that Okinawans are very spiritual, andrely both on doctors and shamans. The effect of spirituality on longevity isless clear than that of diet, but it is often found to be associated withlong-lived populations. Many scientific studies suggest that spirituality can beeffective in both preventing and treating some diseases and medical conditions.Having interviewed centenarians all over the world, I think the commondenominator is not spirituality per se, but a sense of purpose, a will to live.A distinguished colleague once told me his theory: “What many of thelongest-lived people in the world have in common,” he said, “is that they aretough. They are fighters, and they will go on even when their own children havedied.” As did Jeanne Calment of France, who reached the record age of 122,outliving both her daughter and grandson by several decades. Calment quitsmoking at 117, not for health reasons, but because she became too blind tolight up by herself and refused to ask for help. Famously witty, she is known tohave said, “I’ve only got one wrinkle, and I’m sitting on it.”image [../images/9781405933940_TheLongevityDiet_014_IMGX.jpg]4.7. Mortality from diseases: Okinawa versus Japan versus USA. Wilcox BJ et al.“Caloric Restriction, the Traditional Okinawan Diet, and Healthy Aging,” Annalsof the New York Academy of Science, 2007.Although it will be difficult to ever quantify this, my conclusion is that somecentenarians find their strength in God, some in their families, but many findit in the joy of living—in tasting an egg after going through years of war andfamine when they could only dream of eggs, or simply drinking a glass of wine.Which brings me to Italy, and two of my favorite people in the world.SALVATORE CARUSO AND MOLOCHIO, ITALYAlthough my grandparents died years ago, and even my mother and father rarely goback, I have always remembered the many summers I spent in Molochio, and evenafter settling down in Los Angeles I continued to visit. I thought this littlevillage, lost in the Aspromonte mountains, was worth a stop on my yearly visithome to Italy, and so were its people—but I never could have imagined that theelderly people of the little town that holds so many fond childhood memories forme would serve as a confirmation of our discoveries about nutrition andlongevity in the lab and epidemiological surveys among US populations.It was around 2006, and my uncle in Molochio, the village of two thousand peoplewhere both my parents grew up, told me that Salvatore Caruso had reached onehundred years of age. Big deal, I thought. But I remembered Salvatore, uragiuniere (the accountant), who was well known for the interesting stories hetold. He had even written a book chronicling his life.Year after year, the number of centenarians kept on increasing and by 2010, fourvillagers had reached the age of one hundred. So I started visiting Salvatoreand a few others, and I started asking questions about their lifestyle and diet.In addition to the invaluable information about diet and longevity, a great giftfrom these centenarians is their ability to recall one hundred years ofadventures, wars, and stories of all kinds in seconds, to surprise you and makeyou laugh. Soon I realized that Molochio had one of the highest concentrationsof centenarians in the world.Salvatore, who also owned land where he tended olive trees, always said hiscredo was “No Bacco, no tobacco, no Venere,” which didn’t make him very populararound town, since it means no Bacchus (wine), no smoking, no Venus (women). Aswith most centenarians, however, the stories they tell can be very differentfrom the facts; as it happens, Salvatore was married with children and liked todrink wine regularly. I did not have to ask much about his diet, since it wasthe same as my grandfather’s: dark bread, olives, olive oil, walnuts, almonds,stockfish, tomatoes, and most of all and almost every day, pasta e vaianeia, thepasta dish with lots of vegetables and beans, including green beans in the pod.Variations on this dish still represent the most frequent meals at my own table.Why did Salvatore, my grandfather, and everyone else in Molochio eat all thosebeans? Because they were grown locally and were all they could afford. Notsurprisingly, hardship played a key role in the historical diet of this region.In one of the documentaries filmed in Molochio, a French television journalistasked one of the other centenarians of Molochio how many times per week she atemeat in her younger years. At first, she didn’t understand the question. Whenher daughter translated in the local dialect, she started to laugh. “Meat, yes,I had meat. My friends and I snuck into a wedding one time and we ate meat.” Weare so accustomed to thinking about meat consumption in terms of times per weekthat we did not realize that for some of the Molochio centenarians, theopportunities to eat meat were rare.A few years later, I was in another magical place I like to visit every year—themountains of southern Ecuador, where I was studying the villagers with Laronsyndrome—I was interviewed by journalist Stephen Hall, who was writing a coverstory on parts of the world with extraordinary longevity for National Geographic(May 2013 issue). I told him about my grandfather’s village. “If you really wantto meet people who make it to very old age without disease, then you must go tomy parents’ hometown,” I told him. Stephen asked a few questions, but probablythought the same thing I did: it sounds a little too convenient. To my surprise,several months later he emailed me from there. “I’m in Molochio,” he wrote, “andI just confirmed that there are four centenarians and four 99-year-olds amongits 2,000 inhabitants.” The Molochio centenarians became the centerpiece of thestory.image [../images/9781405933940_TheLongevityDiet_015_IMGX.jpg]4.8. With Salvatore Carusoimage [../images/9781405933940_TheLongevityDiet_016_IMGX.jpg]4.9. With Emma MoranoOne key observation, made in collaboration with my colleague Giuseppe Passarino,is that the Molochian centenarians tend to live with their sons’ or daughters’families. Because the younger generation has adopted a more modern diet, wespeculated that transitioning to a higher-protein diet with more animal-basedingredients—which many of the centenarians did in their eighties andnineties—may contribute to their extreme longevity. In other words, maintaininga high-vegetable, low-protein diet for the first seventy or eighty years oflife, and later switching to a diet richer in proteins but also animal-basedfoods like eggs, chicken, milk, and certain cheeses, may have slowed down agingand optimized the health of the Molochio centenarians. This explanation fitswith our discovery that low-protein intake is associated with extended longevityand a major reduction in cancer in people age sixty-five and younger, but not inthose above sixty-six.22 [chapter004_notes.xhtml#ch04-22] In fact, we know thatIGF-1 and other hormones that contribute to aging can reach very low levelsafter age eighty. This may make a strict low-protein diet less beneficialagainst cancer and diabetes in later life, as well as a risk factor for frailtyand defects in the immune system and wound healing. Again, this problem does notrequire complex changes and is solved by maintaining the Longevity Diet untilage sixty-five or seventy, then gradually increasing one’s level of protein andgeneral nourishment by 10 to 20 percent to maintain a healthy weight and musclestrength.EMMA MORANO, VERBANIA, ITALYAnother one of my favorite people was Emma Morano, of Verbania, Italy. Emma diedin 2017 at age 117. Records show that Emma is the oldest Italian ever to havelived, and up until her death she held the title of the oldest living person inthe world. A reporter from The New York Times asked me why Emma, who ate threeeggs a day and consumed plenty of meat, was one of the longest-lived women inhuman history. My response, as quoted in the article: “If you take 100centenarians, you get 100 different elixirs of longevity.”23[chapter004_notes.xhtml#ch04-23]It turns out that although she ate eggs and meat in her old age, Emma’s diet wasprobably much more plant-based, with lots of rice and minestrone, for manydecades of her life. More important, Emma probably had the right genes, whichcan increase by manyfold the chance that someone will live to 100. Her motherhad died at 94, her sister at 102, two other sisters had reached 98, and herbrother passed away at 90.Research shows that the sons of centenarians have an overall 50 percentreduction of disease onset for hypertension, stroke and seizure, cardiacdisease, and diabetes. According to these data, having just one parent who livespast the age of 87 reduces your chances of getting cancer by 24 percent.24[chapter004_notes.xhtml#ch04-24] This is analogous to something we saw among theLaron people of Ecuador: the rare individuals who maintain a very unhealthy dietbecome overweight or obese but still live a long and healthy life. Furthermore,Emma was under the care of an excellent physician, Dr. Carlo Bava, whose medicaldecisions for the past thirty years undoubtedly contributed to her recordlongevity.Scientists are trying to test and produce drugs capable of causing the sameeffects as the genetic mutations that extend the healthy lifespan, but thosewon’t be available for many years. For now, the food we eat is the most potentintervention available for disease prevention and treatment.Emma remembered a lot, but the things she talked about most were the death ofher son—at only seven months of age—and how she packed her bags and left herex-husband after he abused her. That had happened in her late thirties, nearlyeighty years in the past by the time she was telling me her stories. I was alsoimpressed by how protective she was of her photo album, not letting me touch itand swatting my hand away whenever I got too close. She was letting me know thatshe would be needing it for a long time to come.Her zest for life was evident in other ways too. When we visited Emma in 2015, aresearcher from my group proposed to bring a scarf as a present. But I thoughtit might be better to bring something Emma could enjoy more. So we brought her acake made of fruit. When I gave Emma the cake, she was tired and absentminded,so she didn’t say anything about the cake. Her reaction made me think she didn’tlike it and maybe it would have been better to bring her a scarf. As weexchanged greetings, one of her nieces said: “Don’t worry, Aunt. I’ll put thecake right there, next to you, close to the pillow.” After just five minutes,Emma was eating the cake enthusiastically. Ten minutes later, the cake was gone.Emma had devoured it in a very organized way, feeding herself without dropping acrumb. She also had a bowl of soup and some eggs.SARDINIA: THE ISLAND OF LONGEVITYAlthough I’m only now beginning to follow the centenarians of the Nuoro regionof Sardinia, Italy, researchers Gianni Pes, Michel Poulain, and Luca Deiana, aswell as author Dan Buettner, have made this region world famous. Certainvillages in Sardinia’s blue zone have had the number of centenarians reachlevels among the highest observed anywhere in the world and possibly even higherthan those of Molochio.Nowadays many regions (Russia and South America, in particular) claim to havehigh longevity zones. But the stories about longevity coming out of these areasare often invented by inhabitants who want to lure journalists and tourists.Sardinia, on the other hand, is an area of record longevity validated bydemographers. The Sardinians eat a diet that is probably familiar to you by now:mostly plant-based, with beans, whole-grain breads, and lots of vegetables.Because of high local production, they also consume pecorino, the high omega-3cheese made from ewe’s milk.LOMA LINDA: CALIFORNIA’S LAND OF LONGEVITYAn hour’s drive from Los Angeles is a Seventh-day Adventist church that has beenunder close scrutiny by Dr. Gary Fraser and others of Loma Linda University.When researchers compared the longevity of Californians belonging to this churchwith the longevity of all Californians, they found that the Adventist men—whoare vegetarians—lived nearly ten years longer than the average California man.Adventist women lived on average six years longer than California women ingeneral.25 [chapter004_notes.xhtml#ch04-25] Again, not surprisingly, among thevery long-lived vegetarian California Adventists, those who consumed nuts atleast five times a week, two or more servings of vegetables per day, and threeor more servings of legumes per week lived the longest and had reduced incidenceof disease. Other common characteristics of California Adventists, besidesvegetarianism, are eating light dinners early, exercising often, and maintaininga healthy weight and abdominal circumference. Even in Southern California, thecenter for fad diets, members of the longest-lived community consume lots ofvegetables, legumes, walnuts, and almonds, which they spread across two or threedaily meals served within twelve hours.PILLAR 5: STUDIES OF COMPLEX SYSTEMSThis is clearly the most abstract of the pillars, but it can play an importantsupporting role in reaching solid conclusions. For example, we can betterunderstand the effect of age on the requirement for higher protein and foodintake in elderly and frail Americans, and in centenarians, by considering howpoorly maintained cars may lose fuel efficiency as they get older. Another wayto use complex systems like cars or planes to understand human aging is bycomparing the complicated nourishment of the human body to not only gasoline(the source of energy) but also brake fluid, radiator coolant, and motor oil.For example, the radiator is not involved in running the car, but its ability tocool the engine makes it essential for the car’s longevity.In either the human body or a car, low fluid level—even of fluids needed for arelatively minor subsystem, such as the radiator—can accelerate aging and causethe whole system to break down. Undernourishment in humans is like low levels ofmotor oils or other fluids in cars. Another comparison: the car—like the humanbody—needs both high-quality oils and fuel for its brakes and engine to operateproperly. If these products are of low quality or the wrong kind—similar tosaturated fats in our diet—the engine and other parts of the car can be damagedand deteriorate faster. Eventually the damage will lead to car problems thatmust be fixed, just as the aging process in humans leads to diseases. Theseanalogies help simplify the complexity of human biochemistry and underline thefundamental link between nutrients, their functions, aging, and disease. As Ihave already mentioned, whereas the correct levels of proteins, unsaturatedfats, and carbohydrates are beneficial, excess levels of proteins, saturatedfats, and sugars can accelerate aging and damage the human body. This is notsurprising, considering that humans have evolved in an environment whereproteins, sugars, and saturated fats were rarely available at high levels forlong periods.THE LONGEVITY DIET IN SUMMARY 1. Eat mostly vegan, plus a little fish, limiting meals with fish to a maximum of two or three times per week. Choose fish, crustaceans, and mollusks with a high omega-3, omega-6, and vitamin B12 content (salmon, anchovies, sardines, cod, sea bream, trout, clams, shrimp; see appendix B [appendix002.xhtml]). Pay attention to the quality of the fish, choosing those with low levels of mercury. 2. If you are below the age of sixty-five, keep the intake of protein low (0.31 to 0.36 grams per pound of body weight). That comes to 40 to 47 grams of protein per day for a person weighing 130 pounds, and 60 to 70 grams of protein per day for someone weighing 200 to 220 pounds. Those beyond age sixty-five should slightly increase their protein intake, including fish, eggs, white meat, and products derived from goats and sheep, to preserve muscle mass. Consume beans, chickpeas, green peas, and other legumes as your main source of protein. 3. Minimize saturated fats from animal and vegetable sources (meat, cheese) and sugar, and maximize good fats and complex carbs. Eat whole grains and high quantities of vegetables (tomatoes, broccoli, carrots, legumes, etc.) with generous amounts of olive oil (3 tablespoons per day) and nuts (1 ounce per day). See the biweekly diet program in appendix A [appendix001.xhtml]. 4. Follow a diet with high vitamin and mineral content and complete it with a multivitamin buffer every 3 days. 5. Select ingredients among those discussed in this book that your ancestors would have eaten. 6. Based on your weight, age, and abdominal circumference, decide whether to have two or three meals per day (see chapter 8 [chapter008.xhtml] for diabetes guidelines). If you are overweight or tend to gain weight easily, consume two meals a day: breakfast and either lunch or dinner, plus two low-sugar (less than 5 grams) snacks with fewer than 100 calories each. If you are already at a normal weight, or if you tend to lose weight easily or are over 65 and of normal weight, eat three meals a day and one low-sugar (less than 3 to 5 grams) snack with fewer than 100 calories. 7. Confine all eating to within a twelve-hour period; for example, start after 8 a.m. and end before 8 p.m. Don’t eat anything within three to four hours of bedtime. 8. Until age 65–70, depending on weight and frailty, undergo five days of a fasting-mimicking diet (see chapter 6 [chapter006.xhtml]) every one to six months, based on your goals and, if possible, a dietitian’s or medical doctor’s advice. 9. Follow points 1 through 8 in such a way that you reach and maintain a healthy weight and abdominal circumference."},{"pageContent":"Penguin walking logo [../images/PCHI_1.gif]CHAPTER 5EXERCISE AND HEALTHY LONGEVITYA LESSON FROM CENTENARIANSIn general, those who reach age one hundred in good health have stayed active orvery active into old age. There are of course exceptions. If you look atcentenarians, or even just within your own extended family, you will likely findsomeone who beat the odds: eating whatever they wanted, seldom exercising, yetmaking it to a ripe old age. Nir Barzilai of the Albert Einstein College ofMedicine studies Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians in New York, many of whom arecompletely sedentary, he reports. Their longevity is likely due to genetics.Clearly genes are the most powerful factor in determining lifespan. We know thisbecause we have identified mutations that cause a high degree of protectionagainst age-related diseases in both mice and humans. We also know that achimpanzee can eat the perfect diet and exercise regularly yet never come closeto the average human lifespan. Despite sharing 95 percent of our DNA sequence,chimps rarely live beyond age fifty. There is nothing we can do about our genes.But after making changes in the diet, the second major factor affecting lifespanis physical activity.In Okinawa, I heard stories of fishermen who never retire, and I watched a womanin her nineties dance with a large bottle on her head, something she did manytimes a week. When she wasn’t dancing, she enjoyed playing traditional Japanesemusical instruments. In Calabria, 110-year-old Salvatore Caruso told me how hewalked every day to the oliveto (olive grove) and how much labor his olive treesrequired. In Loma Linda, the very long-lived Seventh-day Adventists are famousfor their high levels of exercise, including walking fast and going to the gym.1[chapter005_notes.xhtml#ch05-1] When Dan Buettner asked very long-lived CostaRicans to share the secret to their longevity, they said they enjoyed doingphysical work all their lives. When I posed the same question to the shepherdsof towns with famously long-lived populations in Sardinia, they told me thatevery year they left their homes around November so they could walk their sheepto lower elevations and warmer areas, where the animals can find food, and theydidn’t return until April or May.2 [chapter005_notes.xhtml#ch05-2]What physical activity is best for healthy longevity? The one you enjoy most,but also the one you can easily incorporate into your daily schedule and the oneyou can keep doing up to your hundredth birthday and beyond. Many Okinawanspractice martial arts, especially a dance-inspired version of tai chi. The typeof exercise you choose isn’t important. What’s important is working all yourbody parts until you breathe rapidly and sweat for five to ten hours a week.I’m not talking about running weekly marathons. Overworking your body is not agood idea. If you consider the “complex systems” pillar described earlier andthink about a car, why is it that no one wants to buy a five-year-old car withone hundred thousand miles on the odometer? Because despite being relativelynew, it has been driven too much. You can replace the tires and repaint thechassis, but you cannot change every belt, hose, and valve, and there’s a highchance that some overworked component will break down. On the other hand, youdon’t want to leave your car parked in the garage most of the time, as this willalso eventually cause it to break down.The same holds true for the human body. It’s important to exercise, but not tooverexercise, because knees, hips, and joints will eventually getdamaged—particularly if you continue to exercise when you feel pain. On thebright side, certain exercises and diet can cause tissue to self-repair andregenerate, so the human body has built-in advantages over a car.OPTIMIZING EXERCISE FOR LONGEVITYThe following guidelines are for exercising to maximize health and longevity:> Walk fast for an hour every day. The goal of walking for an hour a day can> easily be achieved. For example, pick a coffee shop or restaurant fifteen> minutes from your work and make a point of going there twice a day. It can> also be achieved on the weekend by walking when you would normally drive.> Every year, I take my USC students from Los Angeles to Genoa, Italy, for three> weeks. On the first day, we do a walking tour of the city. I then urge them to> continue walking everywhere for the duration of the trip. By the end of the> course, they are used to walking around the city and realize that they enjoy> it and feel better in general.> > Ride, run, or swim thirty to forty minutes every other day, plus two hours on> the weekend. The best way to achieve this goal is to have both a stationary> bike and a road bike. When you can, ride outside; when you can’t, use the> exercise bike in high gear (use a bike that provides the option of high> magnetic resistance, which makes it hard to pedal—as if you were going> uphill). After ten minutes, you should be sweating. If you ride on the street,> go uphill for at least ten to fifteen minutes. Do this for about forty minutes> every other day and for two hours on the weekend.> > Bicycling may be healthier than running because it minimizes stress on the> joints. However, a long-term study showed that long-distance running among> healthy older adults was not associated with osteoarthritis,3> [chapter005_notes.xhtml#ch05-3] so an injury caused by long-distance running> may be less common than we would expect. In fact, another study that followed> 74,752 runners for seven years concluded that running reduced both weight and> the risk of osteoarthritis.4 [chapter005_notes.xhtml#ch05-4]> > Following one pillar of longevity (studies of complex systems), we could> conclude that bicycling is preferable to running. But following another pillar> (epidemiology), running would appear to be equally good. Its beneficial> effects, however, may change over time and may vary in individuals who are> injured, have joint damage, and continue to run. Thus, I would recommend a> bicycle as a first choice, but running is also fine if the limits described> below are followed. Swimming is another excellent form of exercise, although> its beneficial effects on longevity have received less scrutiny than those of> running.> > Use your muscles. Humans evolved as a species that walks, runs, climbs trees> and hills, and uses a variety of muscles all the time. Now people use> elevators and escalators instead of stairs, drive instead of walk, use> dishwashers and washing machines instead of washing dishes and clothes by> hand, buy food instead of growing it, and hire people to do even minor repair> work around the house instead of fixing things ourselves.> > Every muscle of the body needs to be used frequently, because muscles grow and> maintain or gain strength only in response to being challenged. Climbing six> flights of stairs rapidly can cause leg pain, especially if you haven’t done> it in a long time. That pain is evidence of minor injury to your muscles. In> the presence of sufficient amounts of proteins, muscle injury leads to the> activation of “muscle satellite cells” and, eventually, to muscle growth.> Muscles can be slightly injured and rebuilt by doing simple everyday tasks> that are challenging. Of course, minor injury can turn into major injury if> the burden in weight-bearing exercise is too high or if you keep reinjuring> already inflamed muscle or cartilage. Muscle training must be balanced to> avoid both acute injuries and the slow, chronic damage that comes with> ignoring pain and continuing to put stress on an injured joint.EXERCISE LENGTH, STRENGTH, AND EFFICACYHow long and how strenuously should you exercise to optimize healthy longevity?Most studies linking exercise and longevity are sustained by just a singlepillar, epidemiology, which is insufficient to reliably conclude a primary rolefor exercise in longer life. Nonetheless, exercise and longevity studies stillprovide very valuable information, particularly when hundreds of thousands ofsubjects are followed.An Australian study looking for a link between exercise and longevity monitored204,542 people ages forty-five to seventy-five for eight years. The groupreporting more than 150 minutes a week of moderate to vigorous exercisedisplayed a 47 percent reduction in overall mortality, while the groupexercising at moderate to vigorous levels for 300 minutes per week had a 54percent reduction, so twice as much exercise did not provide much additionalbenefit.5 [chapter005_notes.xhtml#ch05-5] The effect was increased by another 9percent in those who sometimes exercised vigorously.Metabolic equivalent tasks (METs) are commonly used to express the intensity ofphysical activity. One MET is defined as the energy cost of sitting quietly andis equivalent to a caloric consumption of 1 kilocalorie per kilogram per hour.Moderate exercise involves movement that burns three to six times the caloriesused when sitting still (3 to 6 METs). Vigorous exercise burns calories at morethan six times the resting level (more than 6 METs).image [../images/9781405933940_TheLongevityDiet_017_IMGX.jpg]5.1. Exercise levels and corresponding activities.Another very large study, combining data from six studies performed in theUnited States and Europe, followed 661,137 men and women (with a median age ofsixty-two) over fourteen years. During that period, 116,686 participants died.The data showed that even those who exercised less than 150 minutes at moderateintensity or 75 minutes at vigorous intensity per week had a 20 percent reducedrisk of mortality compared with those who did not exercise. Mortality wasreduced by 31 percent in those who exercised for more than 150 minutes a week atmoderate intensity or for more than 75 minutes a week at vigorous intensity. Andthe risk of dying was reduced by 37 percent in those exercising more than 300minutes a week at moderate intensity or 150 minutes at high intensity.6[chapter005_notes.xhtml#ch05-6] Again, the difference between exercising for 150or 300 minutes was minimal. Exercising more than this resulted in very minoradditional health benefits, but the study showed a trend for a potentially lessbeneficial effect among those who exercised ten times the recommended minimum.PROTEIN INTAKE AND WEIGHT TRAININGHigh protein intake is believed by most to be necessary to maintain or increasemuscle mass. However, several studies indicate that exceeding a daily proteinintake of 0.33 grams per pound of body weight does not increase muscle growthand that consuming 30 grams of protein in a single low-carbohydrate or verylow-carbohydrate meal optimizes muscle synthesis.7[chapter005_notes.xhtml#ch05-7] For best results, the 30 grams of protein shouldbe consumed one to two hours after resistance training, such as lifting weightsor doing push-ups. In both young and older individuals, the ideal musclesynthesis occurred when the weight being lifted or pushed was 60 to 75 percentof one’s maximum capacity.8 [chapter005_notes.xhtml#ch05-8]OPTIMIZING ENERGY IN SUMMARY 1. Walk fast for an hour every day. 2. Take the stairs instead of escalators and elevators. 3. On the weekend, walk everywhere, even faraway places (avoid polluted areas as much as you can). 4. Do moderate exercise for 2½ to 5 hours a week, with some of it in the vigorous range. Most of the beneficial effects appear to be caused by the first 2.5 hours of exercise, making the additional exercise optional. 5. Use weight training or weight-free exercises to strengthen all muscles. 6. To maximize muscle growth, consume at least 30 grams of protein in a single meal one to two hours after a relatively intense weight-training session."},{"pageContent":"Penguin walking logo [../images/PCHI_1.gif]CHAPTER 6FASTING-MIMICKING DIETS, WEIGHT MANAGEMENT, AND HEALTHY LONGEVITYAs I mentioned earlier, in 1992, when I saw my mentor Roy Walford exit Biosphere2 after nearly two years of a severe calorie-restricted diet, I looked at Royand the other seven emaciated Biospherians and thought, “There must be a betterway to delay aging and prevent disease.” Ten years later, as I was searching forways to protect cancer patients while leaving their cancer cells vulnerable totherapy, I remembered the baker’s yeast experiments from my doctoral research atUCLA. Moving yeast cells from a sugar-rich medium into a medium of pure waterhad protected them from various toxins, and also caused cells to live twice aslong. We eventually determined that switching mice from their normalhigh-calorie diet to water also protected them from damage caused by the sametoxins. And since we knew that both humans and monkeys kept on chronic calorierestriction were at risk for side effects—immune system deficiencies, problemswith wound healing, extremely low weight, and high levels of stress, to name afew—I wondered: Could the protective effect of short periods of fasting continueafter the mice returned to a normal diet? If so, we could design a periodicshort-term fast that would be easy to implement. The burden would be minimal,and the timing and frequency would be within the individual’s control. Bylimiting the period of fasting to four to five days no more than once a month wecould also minimize the side effects.It was a great plan in theory, but when we tested water-only fasting in cancerpatients, the three-day trial was not exactly a roaring success. Not because theresults were bad—they were in fact very promising—but because the patients, whowere undergoing chemotherapy at the time, found it difficult to undergo such anextreme fast, and their doctors and nurses were also very resistant to the idea(see chapter 7 [chapter007.xhtml] for more on cancer prevention and treatment).So we needed to find a different solution.In our cancer studies with mice, we had determined that four major changes inthe blood need to occur to show that the mouse had entered a protected state asa result of fasting: (1) lower levels of the growth factor IGF-1; (2) lowerlevels of glucose; (3) higher levels of ketone bodies, the by-product of fatbreakdown; and (4) higher levels of a growth factor inhibitor (IGFBP1).To achieve these results (i.e., to mimic fasting), we fine-tuned a diet low inproteins and sugars and rich in healthy fats. We took advantage of manyadditional nutritechnologies developed in my lab to ensure proper nourishmentand maximum therapeutic effects. We called this regimen the fasting-mimickingdiet (FMD), and later developed it into the product ProLon.When we tested the three-day-long ProLon in sixteen-month-old mice (theequivalent of a forty-five-year-old human), the results were remarkable: * Their 75 percent lifespan (that is, the age at which 75 percent of the mice were still alive) was extended by 18 percent. Their 50 percent lifespan grew by 11 percent. * The mice ate the same quantities of food per month as the mice on the non-ProLon diet, yet they lost weight, primarily abdominal fat, without loss of muscle mass. * Age-dependent loss of bone mineral density dropped. * Tumors were reduced by nearly half, and cancer onset for the great majority of mice on ProLon was pushed back to twenty-six months (equivalent to approximately seventy years for humans) from the onset at twenty months (equivalent to approximately age sixty in humans) in the group on the normal diet. Furthermore, the abnormal lesions in mice on Prolon tended to occur in no more than two organs, indicating that many tumors were probably benign. * Skin inflammatory disorders were cut in half. * In the ProLon group, a stem cell–dependent regenerative process rejuvenated the immune system. Regeneration also occurred in the liver, muscle, and brain. Levels of several types of stem cells increased. * In three different cognitive tests, old mice in the ProLon group performed better at motor coordination (movement), learning, and remembering than the control group.Consistent with our ProLon research in middle-age mice, we showed in severalother mouse studies discussed in the following chapters that periodic fastingpromotes stem cell–dependent regeneration in the immune system, nervous system,and pancreas. The fasting itself destroys many damaged cells, and damagedcomponents inside the cells but it also activates stem cells. Once the micebegin eating again, these stem cells become part of a program to regenerate theorgan or system, with the newly regenerated cells bearing characteristics ofyounger, more functional cells.1 [chapter006_notes.xhtml#ch06-1] Additionally,the inside of a variety of cells is partially rebuilt as part of a processcalled autophagy, also contributing to cellular rejuvenation.image [../images/9781405933940_TheLongevityDiet_018_IMGX.jpg]6.1. Mice receive FMD twice a month from the age of sixteen months.image [../images/9781405933940_TheLongevityDiet_019_IMGX.jpg]6.2. Old mice exposed to FMD show less bone density loss (mgHa) when comparedwith those in the control group.image [../images/9781405933940_TheLongevityDiet_020_IMGX.jpg]6.3. Mice that receive FMD in middle age experience rejuvenation of the immunesystem.EFFECTS OF PROLON IN HUMANS: A HUNDRED-SUBJECT CLINICAL TRIALThese remarkable results from the mouse studies prompted us to develop anequivalent fasting-mimicking diet for humans. Unlike the one we had developedfor cancer patients (see chapter 7 [chapter007.xhtml]), this FMD would haveenough calories, vitamins, minerals, and essential nutrients to require minimalmedical supervision.Abstaining from food is a tradition that goes back thousands of years. EarlyChristians performed the Black Fast during Lent, Muslims fast during Ramadan,and Hindus set aside one day a week for fasting. While little is known about thefrequency of fasting in prehistoric times, it’s certain that periodic prolongedfasting was common among our Paleolithic and Neolithic ancestors. Religiousfasting has been all but abandoned in modern times; among Christians, the Lentenpractice of forty days of calorie restriction ending in a week of water-onlyfasting has almost disappeared, and the traditional Ramadan fasting month, meantto be a period of restriction and self-discipline during the day, nowadays isoften accompanied by overeating after sunset. But the mere fact that fasting ishistorically common to most religions supports the idea that fasting is not afad diet, but part of our history and evolution. However, religious fasting wasnot and is not done for health reasons, so it was important to identify a lengthand type of fasting that is in fact beneficial for health, while minimizing theburden and safety concerns associated with fasting. A label that is now widelyused by the media is “Intermittent Fasting.” I believe this represents aproblematic direction because, like the “Mediterranean Diet” or “eating inmoderation” it allows people to improvise and pick and choose periods of fastingthat range from 12 hours to weeks, giving the impression that just because theyall involve some period of “abstention from food” they are similar or equivalentand all provide health benefits. In fact, they have very different effects. Forexample, if we consider fasting as the period necessary to switch from aprimarily sugar-burning mode to a fat-burning mode, then only periods ofabstention from food lasting two or three days or more can be consideredfasting. The same length of fasting appears to be necessary to trigger theactivation of “regenerative” programs. This does not mean that shorter periodsof abstention from food cannot be beneficial, but that we should not use wordslike “Intermittent Fasting” to include interventions that are very different andhave very different effects just like we don’t want to place in the samecategory walking for fifteen minutes and running a marathon.We have abundant safety data on long-term fasting from such programs as NorthernCalifornia’s TrueNorth Health Center and the Buchinger Wilhelmi clinics inGermany and Spain, where thousands of patients a year undergo fasts of a week orlonger supervised by medical staff. Because these fasting regimens are eitherwater-only (TrueNorth) or confined to a few hundred calories per day (BuchingerWilhelmi), it is important to do this in a specialized clinic and under medicalsupervision. Some doctors and nutritionists offer outpatient fasting support,but this requires expertise and can be dangerous.By contrast, the five-day FMD was developed with the following goals: 1. To provide sufficient calories to be safe outside of a clinic 2. To provide a variety of components that most people can enjoy 3. To be 100 percent plant-based, as described in the Longevity Diet in chapter 4 [chapter004.xhtml] 4. To be equally effective as fasting, if not more soThe FMD, as demonstrated in our animal studies, treats aging and promoteshealthy longevity using the following processes: * Switching all cells to a protected anti-aging mode * Promoting autophagy (self-eating of parts of the cell) and replacing damaged cell components with newly generated functional ones * Killing damaged cells in many organs and systems and replacing them with newly regenerated cells from activated stem cells * Shifting the body into an abdominal/visceral fat-burning mode, which continues after returning to a normal diet (probably due to epigenetic changes, which are modifications of the DNA and proteins that bind DNA)Our randomized study of one hundred patients carried out at the USC medicalcenter yielded impressive results. Participants who adopted an FMD for five daysa month over a period of three months showed remarkable outcomes in thefollowing areas:image [../images/9781405933940_TheLongevityDiet_021_IMGX.jpg]6.4. Reduction in risk factors for diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular diseasesafter three cycles of the FMD (one hundred subjects randomized clinical trial)Three months after the last ProLon FMD cycle, test subjects still benefited froma significant loss of body fat and reductions in waist circumference, glucoselevels, IGF-1, and blood pressure, all of which suggests that the use of the FMDevery three months may be sufficient to reduce the risk of a number of diseases.AWAKENING THE REJUVENATION FROM WITHINIf a forty-five-year-old couple can have a near-perfect baby, then clearly theadult body holds all the information necessary to generate a new and viable setof cells, organs, and systems without transferring any of the damage present inthe original oocyte and sperm cell. But is it possible to trigger the sameregenerative process within adult organisms?Perhaps I’m biased because it was my group that discovered its beneficialeffects, but I believe the FMD is probably the best way to start thisregenerative and self-healing process, with minimal or potentially no sideeffects (see my TEDx talk, “Fasting: Awakening the Rejuvenation from Within,” onYouTube). The randomized clinical trial results outlined above were achieved injust three months after three cycles of five-day FMD using human subjects. Thefindings are in keeping with our mouse studies, which showed that FMD acts bybreaking down and regenerating the inside of cells (autophagy) and killing offand replacing damaged cells (regeneration). In fact, both in humans and mice, wedetected a transient elevation of circulating stem cells in the blood duringFMD, which may be responsible for the regeneration and rejuvenation occurring inmultiple systems.image [../images/9781405933940_TheLongevityDiet_022_IMGX.jpg]6.5. The sperm cell and egg of a couple in their forties can create a perfectbaby.By feeding people a very specific diet that tricks the organism into astarvation mode, most organs and systems eliminate unnecessary components(proteins, mitochondria, etc.) but also kill off many cells. As a result, theorganism saves energy because it needs to maintain fewer and less active cells.In addition, both cells that are killed and cellular components broken down byautophagy can provide energy to other cells. A good analogy is to think of thebody as an old wood-burning steam locomotive low on wood. To reach the nextfueling station, the fireman can start burning the train’s oldest and mostdamaged wooden seats and walls, making the train lighter while generating thesteam needed to keep it going. Just as the seats can be rebuilt once the trainreaches the fueling station, the streamlined cells, systems, and organs can berebuilt by activating stem or progenitor cells and activating repair andreplacement systems inside the cell to cause regeneration—once the body resumesnormal feeding patterns.image [../images/9781405933940_TheLongevityDiet_023_IMGX.jpg]6.6. Blood stem cells in patients during FMDFMD VERSUS DRUGS AND STEM CELL–BASED THERAPIESMany promoters of alternative medicine avoid traditional medicine and even newtechnologies entirely. Similarly, many doctors and scientists searching for newtherapies avoid alternative and natural interventions at all costs. This is amistake on both sides, and will often mean that a therapy or preventive measureis only partly effective.In chapter 7 [chapter007.xhtml], I show how the combination of nutritionalstrategies and conventional therapies is the most effective for treating cancerin mice, with high potential to achieve the same in humans. My lab has begun todemonstrate the benefits of this mixed strategy for humans as well. However, thepotential promise of effective drugs and stem cell–based therapies for otherdiseases and conditions shouldn’t be an alternative to leading a life of goodnutrition and other natural interventions to promote self-healing andself-preservation, since ideally drugs and more aggressive treatments should beused only when natural interventions are not enough. The reason for this is thatnatural interventions are the result of billions of years of evolution and inmany cases can be highly coordinated and minimize or eliminate side effects,whereas drugs or other therapies will have side effects, some of which won’t bedetected until years after the beginning of treatment.Statin drugs, for example, lower cholesterol by reducing the activity of thecholesterol-producing enzyme HMG-CoA reductase. But this approach is a Band-Aidsolution that, instead of fixing the original problem at its source, simplyreduces one of the negative symptoms generated by the problem. I once asked acholesterol expert, “Why do some people’s bodies produce much more cholesterolthan they need? What is the body trying to do?” Both surprised and annoyed, hereplied, “I don’t know. It just does.”Organisms don’t waste precious resources generating molecules they don’t need.The right therapy for high cholesterol and cardiovascular disease is not toblock generation of this molecule, but to find out what is not functioningproperly in the body and what command the system is responding to whenoverproducing cholesterol, so that the problem can be fixed at its foundation.Simply blocking the generation of cholesterol is like adding coolant to anoverheated car engine—it will undoubtedly help, but the underlying engineproblem remains, and eventually the car will break down. Indeed, an analysis ofeleven randomized studies found that taking statins does not change one’s riskof dying.2 [chapter006_notes.xhtml#ch06-2] The same is true for the greatmajority of drugs, whether they target glucose, cholesterol, or blood pressurelevels: they don’t fix the problem; they merely try to limit the damage itcauses. Sometimes they work very well and can save or prolong lives. But oftenthey represent a partial solution that creates new problems. This is why, as Ipointed out in earlier chapters, biologists, physicians, and dietitians shouldwork together in teams using their respective problem-solving skills to have animmediate and long-term impact on patients. My own lab has been working foryears with medical doctors, and we hope this will become the clinical standardsomeday.Take, for example, a forty-five-year-old person with slightly elevatedcholesterol, a fifty-five-year-old man with mild hypertension, or a woman whosegrandmother died of breast cancer at age eighty-five; these kinds of high riskfactors can likely be reduced or reversed with a combination of the longevitydiet described earlier and a periodic FMD, according to findings emerging fromour clinical studies. This can forestall or even eliminate the future need fordrug or stem cell therapies or may allow the use of lower levels of drugs. Themajor advantage of the FMD approach—compared with drug interventions and stemcell–based therapies—is that it awakens a highly coordinated response that isalready built into the body but that has fallen dormant because of our steadyand constant consumption of food. At present, FMD represents perhaps the safestand most potent way to reverse many age- and diet-related problems by fixing orreplacing, and thereby rejuvenating, cells, systems, and organs in a naturalway.FMD achieves this by taking advantage of billions of years of evolution toactivate a self-healing program resembling the embryogenesis process (i.e., thenormal growth of a fetus). We have demonstrated this in mice and human cells.For example, we were able to cause severe damage and insulin deficiency in thepancreas of both mice with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and show that FMD cyclespromote the regeneration of pancreatic cells to restore insulin production.3[chapter006_notes.xhtml#ch06-3] As described earlier in the chapter, FMD cyclesalso reduce fasting glucose and return prediabetic subjects to the normalglucose range. As pointed out below, in participants with normal blood pressure,glucose, cholesterol, and inflammation, we did not find big changes in the levelof risk factors in response to three monthly cycles of the FMD, but we sawsignificant changes among those with the highest levels of risk factors beforebeginning the FMD. This is consistent with a rejuvenation effect—a true reversalof the physical damage or underlying problem, not simply the blockage ofcholesterol synthesis or lowering of glucose levels achieved with statins ordiabetes drugs.image [../images/9781405933940_TheLongevityDiet_024_IMGX.jpg]6.7. The rejuvenating effects of the FMDTHE FASTING-MIMICKING DIETWhat follows is a simplified version of the FMD tested in our clinical study ofone hundred patients at Keck Medical Center of USC and now also recommended topatients by thousands of US and UK doctors. At least ten thousand patients haveundergone the ProLon FMD therapy, and there have been no reports of major sideeffects. The goal in this section is to provide general information that you cantake to doctors and dietitians for help implementing the diet, rather thanspecific recipes for readers to implement on their own. The FMD clinicallytested and commercialized by L-Nutra is far more complex than what I describebelow, and it includes a precise formula with ingredients that cannot generallybe found in stores, as well as instructions on dosages of specific ingredientsbased on the weight of the patient undertaking the diet. For safety and efficacyreasons, it is strongly recommended that patients do the ProLon FMD and not a“homemade” version of it, which could be ineffective and potentially harmful.L-Nutra is assembling a network of doctors and registered dietitians whospecialize in these integrative therapies. Further information and resources areavailable at www.prolonfmd.com [http://www.prolonfmd.com] and on my Facebookpage, @profvalterlongo [https://www.facebook.com/profvalterlongo/]. (As pointedout earlier, I do not benefit financially from the sale of ProLon.)WHO MAY DO THE FMD * Healthy adults in the normal weight range between the ages of eighteen and seventy years may undertake the FMD. A few genetic mutations, however, are incompatible with long-term fasting. If any side effects occur other than slight weakness, tiredness, or a headache, you should contact your doctor. Drink a small quantity of fruit juice for immediate relief.WHO MAY NOT DO THE FMD * Pregnant women. * People who are underweight, have very low body mass index, or suffer from anorexia. * People over the age of seventy, unless in superior health—and then only with a doctor’s approval. * Anyone who is fragile. * People with liver or kidney diseases. * People affected by pathologies, unless they have the prior approval of their specialized doctor. In the case of serious or relatively serious illnesses (cancer, diabetes, or cardiovascular, autoimmune, or neurodegenerative diseases), it is important to seek permission and approval from a disease specialist as well as from a dietitian with expertise in the FMD or in therapeutic fasting. The use of the FMD for disease treatment should for the moment be limited to clinical trials unless the doctor determines that there are no other viable options and the patient cannot wait until the conclusion of appropriate clinical trials and FDA approval. * Patients who take medication should not undertake the FMD without the approval of their doctor with input from a dietitian or doctor who specializes in the use of the FMD. Although it may be possible to combine the FMD with many drugs without side effects, the combination of the FMD and certain drugs could result in severe side effects. * Patients who have low blood pressure or who are taking medication for hypertension should not undertake the FMD without the approval of a specialized doctor. * Patients with rare genetic mutations that block the organism’s capacity to produce glucose from glycerol and amino acids (gluconeogenesis). * Athletes during training or competition. High muscular effort requires levels of glucose not available in the blood during the FMD, leading to a risk of fainting.OTHER WARNINGS 1. The FMD can never be undertaken in association with insulin or medication that reduces sugar levels. The combination could be lethal. At the end of the FMD, the patient may still be sufficiently insulin-sensitive to have below normal levels of glucose in his or her blood. Because the use of the FMD on diabetic patients could be dangerous, we advise to do it only as part of a clinical trial. Information about upcoming clinical trials can be found on my Facebook page, @profvalterlongo [https://www.facebook.com/profvalterlongo/]. 2. Do not combine the FMD with very hot and lengthy showers, especially during hot weather. There could be a risk of fainting. 3. Drive with caution—or better yet, don’t drive at all—until you know how the FMD affects you. 4. We advise undergoing the FMD in the presence of another person.HOW OFTEN TO UNDERTAKE THE FMDThis is a decision that ideally should be made with input from a doctor orregistered dietitian, but broad guidelines are as follows: 1. Once a month for overweight or obese patients with at least two risk factors for diabetes, cancer, or cardiovascular or neurodegenerative disease 2. Once every two months for average-weight patients with at least two risk factors for diabetes, cancer, or cardiovascular or neurodegenerative disease 3. Once every three months for average-weight patients with at least one risk factor for diabetes, cancer, or cardiovascular or neurodegenerative disease 4. Once every four months for healthy patients with a normal diet who are not physically active 5. Once every six months for healthy patients with an ideal diet (see chapter 4 [chapter004.xhtml]) who engage in regular physical activityWHEN TO START THE FMD * Many people decide to start FMD on a Sunday night so they can end the following Friday night. This decision is based purely on social considerations, allowing them to return to the transition diet on Friday night and to a normal diet on Saturday night. * Preparation * For at least one week before the FMD, we recommend following the Longevity Diet, with 0.36 grams of protein per pound of body weight per day, preferably obtained from vegetables and fish. Multivitamin supplements of omega-3 should be taken at least twice during this preparatory week (see chapter 4 [chapter004.xhtml]).image [../images/9781405933940_TheLongevityDiet_025_IMGX.jpg]WHAT TO EXPECTSIDE EFFECTS 1. Some people feel weak during parts of the FMD. Others say they feel more energetic. 2. Some patients complain of light- or average-intensity headaches. This effect is usually greatly reduced by day 4 or 5, and eliminated entirely by the second or third FMD cycle. 3. Most people feel hungry during the first few days of the FMD. This effect is greatly reduced by day 4 or 5 and on all days during the second or third FMD cycle. 4. Some people suffer a slight backache that disappears once they resume a normal diet.POSITIVE EFFECTSIn addition to the production of stem cells, the reduction of abdominal fat, andlower levels of risk factors for various illnesses, many people report thefollowing beneficial effects during or after FMD: 1. Glowing skin, which many describe as “younger looking.” 2. Stronger mental focus. 3. An ability to resist bingeing once they resume a normal diet. Many reduce their consumption of sugar and calories, and are less prone to excess in their consumption of coffee, alcohol, desserts, etc.Now that you understand the Longevity Diet and how and why it works, and thebasics of the FMD, I will go into detail in the following chapters on how thisprogram can have profound effects when it comes to preventing, delaying,treating, and even reversing specific diseases. The next five chapters containmore detailed information on the work I and my fellow researchers and physiciansaround the world are conducting into the potent links between diet and disease,and they are especially intended to help those individuals at high risk for orsuffering from cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerativedisorders (especially Alzheimer’s), and autoimmune diseases. It is my hope thatthis book can help as many people as possible take control of their health sothat they can supplement the standard care they are receiving with thisintegrative, inexpensive approach.

With this as my goal, fifteenyears ago I decided to switch a large part of my lab to clinical research. As Imentioned in chapter 2 [chapter002.xhtml], I was motivated by my experienceswith children suffering from cancer at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles. Themedical community, I realized, had a deep understanding of how DNA and cellulardamage affect cancer cells, but almost no knowledge of how to protect normalcells, which was the focus of my lab.Our first cancer-related mouse study, as mentioned in chapter 2[chapter002.xhtml], was very simple—basically a spin-off of our studies withmicroorganisms.Paola Fabrizio, a postdoctoral fellow researcher in my group, and I coauthored aseries of papers on studies using yeast as a model organism to identify whatgenes accelerate the aging process. Mario Mirisola, another researcher in mylaboratory, helped me identify the links between genes that accelerate aging andmake cells more vulnerable, and specific nutrients. Remarkably, the genes thatmade the cells weaker were the same genes central to cancer—the oncogenes.Here’s how the process works: When certain genes in cancer cells are modifiedthrough a mutation (a change in the DNA sequence), they become oncogenes. Thischange lets cancer cells divide more than they should, regardless of the signalsthey receive to stop dividing. We discovered that oncogenes also make cellsweaker and more vulnerable to the damage caused by toxins. This occurs becausethese same oncogenes give cells a key characteristic: the ability to disobeyorders and continue growing.When I began my cancer studies, every researcher was looking for a magic bulletthat would seek out and destroy only cancer cells. I don’t remember when I firstdreamed up the idea, but I remember calling one of my colleagues, a famous agingresearcher, to float my theory: “I think I’ve figured out a way to distinguishall cancer cells from all normal cells,” I told her. “It’s not a magicbullet—it’s a magic shield.”I don’t think she had any idea what I was talking about.What I proposed, and eventually called “differential stress resistance,” wasbased on the idea that if you starve an organism, it will go into a highlyprotected, nongrowth mode—this is “the shield.” But a cancer cell will disobeythis order and continue growing even when it is starved, because the oncogene isstuck in an “always on” mode.Imagine a battlefield where ancient Romans and Carthaginians are mixed togetherwearing very similar uniforms. The common approach of cancer therapies is toseek a magic “arrow” (or “bullet”) that will kill only the Carthaginiansoldiers, without harming the Romans. This is tricky, because the soldiers alllook the same to archers standing fifty yards away.But suppose before shooting their arrows, the archers ordered the soldiers, inLatin, to kneel and raise their shields. Because only the Romans wouldunderstand the command, they would take cover, while the Carthaginians wouldremain standing, exposed to the incoming arrows.In this imaginary historical example, the Romans are the normal cells of thebody, the Carthaginians the cancer cells, the archers the oncologists, and thearrows the chemotherapy. If you starve a cancer patient before injectingchemotherapy, normal cells will respond by putting up a defensive shield. Butthe cancer cells will ignore the command to kneel and thus remainvulnerable—providing a way to potentially eradicate cancer cells with minimaldamage to normal cells.When I first proposed starving cancer patients, oncologists thought it was avery bad idea. Because cancer patients often lose weight during chemotherapy,oncologists instruct them to eat more, not less. Clearly, we needed veryconvincing results in mice before we would get approval for a clinical trialwith human subjects.I asked Changhan Lee, one of my graduate students in the Los Angeles laboratory,and Lizzia Raffaghello, a researcher in Genoa, to perform a simple experiment:switch mice with cancer to a water-only diet for two or three days before givingthem multiple cycles of chemotherapy.The results were stunning: virtually all the fasting mice were alive and movingaround normally after high-dose chemotherapy. Mice on a normal diet, however,were sick and moving very little after chemotherapy. In the following weeks, 65percent of the mice that did not fast died, whereas nearly all the fasted micesurvived. We reproduced this same effect using a wide variety of chemotherapydrugs. As hoped and predicted, starvation consistently caused “multi-stressresistance,” or protection against many different toxins in normal cells, butnot cancer cells. We now knew this approach had great clinical potential, but itstill would not be easy getting the medical community to give it a chance.A NOTE TO ANIMAL ACTIVISTSThis seems like a good place to say a word about animal testing. From time totime I receive emails from animal rights activists asking why mice must sufferand die for the sake of research.Here is my answer:First, we do as much of our work as possible with cells and microorganisms, notmice. However, before any human clinical trial can begin, we have no choice butto test interventions in mice.Regarding the supposed cruelty of a forced fast, it’s worth noting that mice,like humans, are perfectly capable of going without food for a few days. Indeed,they benefit from fasting—with longer, healthier, less disease-prone lives. It’strue that when we give the mice chemotherapy, they suffer. I am troubled by thisfact. It seems morally wrong. But I don’t see any alternative.We confine our animal studies to the minimum required in the lead-up to humanclinical trials. In almost every case, these studies target advanced-stagediseases either deadly or devastating to patients.A few years ago, I responded to a letter from an animal activist with thefollowing question: “If your child, sister, or father was dying, and the onlytreatment that might save his/her life needed to be tested first in mice, wouldyou condone the mouse experiments? Or would you choose to see your loved onedie?”I know many activists will still object, but I ask that they be honest andconsider the consequences. If they don’t condone animal experiments under anycircumstances, even those necessary to develop treatments for deadly diseases,then they should never take any drug—even aspirin or antibiotics—and tell theirfamily members to do the same.I believe animal experiments should be undertaken only as a precursor to humanclinical trials in the treatment of advanced-stage and major illnesses. In theabsence of better options, these trials are, unfortunately, a necessary evil.CURING CANCER (IN MICE)Here’s another military scenario with parallels to fighting cancer: In 1812,Napoleon invaded Russia with more than 450,000 men. As the French army movedtoward Moscow, the Russian forces didn’t fight. They retreated, burning theirown villages and towns before the enemy’s advance.Napoleon was surprised and confused. The invasion had started in June, but theRussians refused to fight until December. The strategic retreat was meant toweaken the French army. By winter, Napoleon’s army was in tatters after enduringmonths of starvation, freezing conditions, and the final attack by the Russians.When the war ended, 400,000 French soldiers had perished.Cancer cells behave like Napoleon’s army, advancing even when it would be wiserto stop. To stay alive, they require a lot of nourishment. The typicalnutritional recommendation given by doctors to cancer patients is to “eat well,”and sometimes to “eat more than normal.” This makes intuitive sense, as it madeintuitive sense for the Russian army to engage Napoleon’s invaders the momentthey arrived, in the summer of 1812, when they were well fed. But because theRussians waited until the French soldiers were at their weakest, the combinationof cold, starvation, and targeted attacks by the Russians defeated thempermanently. In the same way, starved cancer cells are most vulnerable to theassault of chemotherapy after fasting.Having conceived the idea of a starvation-induced magic shield, I remembered abasic lesson from evolutionary biology: the great majority of genetic mutations(changes in the DNA) are deleterious, but their negative consequences usuallyappear only under certain conditions. Abundant mutations in the DNA sequence ofcancer cells may well increase their ability to grow, but those same mutationswill greatly impede the cancer cell’s ability to survive in challengingenvironments, for example under the double onslaught of starvation andchemotherapy.image [../images/9781405933940_TheLongevityDiet_026_IMGX.jpg]7.1. Percentage of lung cancer remission in mice subjected to the FMD with andwithout chemotherapy1 [chapter007_notes.xhtml#ch07-1]image [../images/9781405933940_TheLongevityDiet_027_IMGX.jpg]7.2. Cycles of FMD reduce and delay cancer in miceCould this theoretical scenario actually work? Our animal studies and those ofother researchers show that fasting, in addition to protecting normal cells,makes chemotherapy much more toxic to melanoma, breast cancer, prostate cancer,lung cancer, colorectal cancer, neuroblastoma, and many other cancers. In manycases, cycles of fasting (or of a fasting-mimicking diet) are as effective aschemotherapy at fighting cancer. However, neither strategy alone is optimal.Permanent therapeutic effects are achieved only through the combination offasting and chemotherapy. In mouse studies, we saw fasting combined withchemotherapy definitively cured cancer even in the disease’s end stages, afterit had metastasized. Not all mice were cured, but we and others regularlyobtained a 20 to 60 percent cure rate for a variety of cancers.FMD AND IMMUNE-SYSTEM-DEPENDENT KILLING OF CANCER CELLSAmong new therapies to treat and, in some cases, cure cancer, perhaps the mostpromising is immunotherapy, which relies on the immune system to kill cancercells. In another very promising study at USC, we showed that FMD can triggerthe same effects produced by immunotherapy.2 [chapter007_notes.xhtml#ch07-2] Thestudy, which looked at breast cancer and skin cancer cells, found that FMDperforms two main functions: (1) it weakens cancer cells and removes theprotective shield safeguarding them from immune cells; and (2) it renews andrevs the immune system, making it more aggressive toward the cancer.3[chapter007_notes.xhtml#ch07-3]FMD AND CHEMOTHERAPY-RELATED STEROIDSCorticosteroids such as prednisolone, methylprednisolone, and dexamethasone arefrequently used in combination with chemotherapy in cancer treatment. In arecent publication, we showed that the corticosteroid dexamethasone increasedthe toxicity to mice of the chemotherapy drug doxorubicin by increasing thelevel of glucose in the blood.4 [chapter007_notes.xhtml#ch07-4] In earlierchapters, I described how glucose accelerates aging in cells but also makes themweaker when exposed to toxins. Thus, by increasing the levels of blood glucose,corticosteroids make normal cells in mice weaker while probably making cancercells stronger. This effect was reversed by adding the fasting-mimicking diet tothe dexamethasone and chemotherapy treatment. Thus, our results indicate thatcorticosteroids should never be combined with chemotherapy unless there is noviable alternative. In fact, high glucose levels in combination withchemotherapy in patients are associated with an increased risk of developinginfections and with higher death rates when compared with patients with normalblood glucose.5 [chapter007_notes.xhtml#ch07-5] Thus, both our mouse data andpreliminary clinical data indicate that steroid hormones that increase bloodglucose levels can be detrimental in combination with chemotherapy.FASTING AND FASTING-MIMICKING DIETS IN HUMAN CANCER TREATMENTAfter the 2008 publication of our first study on the powerful, protective effectof fasting on mice exposed to chemotherapy, the press was abuzz with stories ona fasting-dependent “magic shield” with the potential to protect cancerpatients. One such article in the Los Angeles Times caught the eye of a localjudge, Nora Quinn, who had recently been diagnosed with breast cancer and wasabout to undergo chemotherapy. Shortly after the story appeared, one of thejudge’s friends called me at USC and informed me that Quinn had been fasting foreight days. I was horrified. “That’s crazy,” I said. “Please tell your friend tostart eating immediately.”As the news reached patients, many decided to improvise and came up with theirown dangerous versions of the FMD. Luckily for Quinn, she ended up respondingwell to shorter periods of fasting in combination with chemotherapy, and didn’tsuffer many of the treatment’s debilitating side effects. I’m happy to reportthat when I recently communicated with her, she remained cancer-free.Another early adopter of FMD was Air France pilot Jean-Jacques Trochon.Diagnosed with metastatic kidney cancer and multiple masses in the lungs, he hadread about our mouse studies in the news and contacted me seeking advice onfasting before chemotherapy. Working with his oncologist, Trochon followed allmy instructions with disciplined rigor to combine an FMD with a plant-basedtherapy developed by another scientist. Two years later, he was cancer-free andhad returned to flying.These anecdotes aren’t proof that the combination of anticancer therapy and FMDcures some cancers. But together with the mouse and the clinical data, theypoint to a potentially effective strategy for improving conventional treatmentoptions while reducing side effects.After we published the 2008 fasting and chemotherapy mouse study, emails startedpouring in from cancer patients interested in trying FMD. I put a youngphysician working in my laboratory in charge of following up and communicatingwith these patients’ oncologists.In our initial interactions with clinical oncologists, we were not takenseriously. But we had compared the effects of fasting with the chemotherapy drugof choice in the treatment of various cancers. We knew that combining the twohad produced a synergic boost in efficacy, at least in mice.We called the oncologists of each patient who had contacted us. Some wouldn’treturn our calls. In several cases, my researcher showed up at the clinic topersonally request copies of the patients’ files. Eventually we collected dataon ten patients: seven women and three men, between the ages of forty-four andseventy-eight, diagnosed with different types and stages of cancer:DEMOGRAPHICAL AND CLINICAL INFORMATION OF PATIENTSimage [../images/9781405933940_TheLongevityDiet_030_IMGX.jpg]7.3. Personal and clinical data of ten patients involved in the study focused onfasting and chemotherapy combinationimage [../images/9781405933940_TheLongevityDiet_029_IMGX.jpg]7.4. Self-reported side effects after chemotherapy with and without fastingEach of these patients had voluntarily fasted for 48 to 140 hours prior to and 5to 56 hours following chemotherapy. They had received an average of four cyclesof various chemotherapy drugs in combination with fasting. None reportedsignificant side effects caused by the fasting itself, other than hunger andlightheadedness. Six patients who underwent chemotherapy both with and withoutfasting reported a reduction in fatigue, weakness, and gastrointestinal sideeffects while fasting. In patients whose cancer progression could be assessed,fasting did not impede the chemotherapy-induced reduction of tumor volume ortumor markers.Since then, several other clinical studies have followed.CLINICAL TRIALSIn collaboration with oncologists at the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center,we performed a clinical trial with eighteen patients on a water-only fast of 24,48, and 72 hours’ duration before receiving platinum-based chemotherapy.6[chapter007_notes.xhtml#ch07-6] Below are the results. In terms of side effectscaused by chemotherapy, 72-hour fasting was generally associated with moreprotection than 24-hour fasting was. However, the water-only fasting was sodifficult for patients that it took over 5 years to complete this small study.This limitation led to funding by the National Cancer Institute of the USNational Institutes of Health to develop a FMD specific for cancer (see below).image [../images/9781405933940_TheLongevityDiet_031_IMGX.jpg]7.5. Different protective effects of fasting for 24, 48, and 72 hours againstside effects of platinum-based chemotherapy in breast, ovarian, uterine, andpulmonary cancer patientsLeiden University in Holland also published a small, randomized clinical trialof thirteen patients undergoing two days of water-only fasting compared with acontrol group.7 [chapter007_notes.xhtml#ch07-7] The study is also consistentwith the protective benefits of fasting with respect to chemotherapy sideeffects.Finally, a study at Charité–University Medicine Berlin tested the impact of avery low-calorie FMD in thirty-four women with breast and ovarian cancer. Eachwoman received multiple cycles of chemotherapy either with or without fasting.Those on the FMD experienced a clear reduction in the side effects caused bychemotherapy. That study has not yet been published.Ongoing clinical trials involving more than three hundred patients are currentlytesting the efficacy of a four-day FMD in combination with standard cancertherapy. Centers involved in these trials include the Mayo Clinic, the USCNorris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Leiden University Medical Center, and theUniversity of Genova San Martino Hospital. An additional ten European and UShospitals are committed to begin similar trials once funds become available.FMD AND CANCER THERAPY: CLINICAL EVIDENCE AND GUIDELINES FOR ONCOLOGISTS ANDCANCER PATIENTS * Extensive animal testing from at least six independent laboratories shows the efficacy of fasting or FMD in protecting against the side effects caused by a wide range of chemotherapy drugs. * Extensive animal testing from at least six independent laboratories shows the efficacy of fasting or FMD in increasing the effect of standard therapy on breast cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, neuroblastoma, glioma, lung cancer, mesothelioma, melanoma, and others. * Three completed small clinical trials and one case series report involving seventy-five patients provide initial evidence that fasting and FMD are safe and potentially effective in protecting patients from multiple side effects of chemotherapy. * Ongoing clinical trials on Chemolieve at leading cancer centers, which have now tested over two hundred patients, provide additional evidence for the safety and potentially protective effect of the FMD against chemotherapy side effects.The FMD product for cancer patients, Chemolieve, can be recommended to patientsby their oncologists once additional tests are done and if the results arepositive. Until this product is shown to be effective and comes to market, theFMD remains an unproven method of cancer treatment and should be consideredpreferably as part of clinical trials and only in combination withstandard-of-care therapies under medical supervision. The patient should beinformed of the risks of undergoing a support therapy that is not yet fullytested. Following are my FMD recommendations to oncologists and cancer patients: 1. If the oncologist agrees, the patient may fast or adopt an FMD for three days before and one day after receiving chemotherapy or other standard-of-care drugs. Depending on the type of chemotherapy being administered and the interval between cycles, this regimen could change. Patients should hold off on resuming their regular diet until the chemotherapy is below toxic blood levels (usually 24 to 48 hours after administration). For treatment lasting up to three days, patients can adopt an FMD one day prior to, three days during, and one day after chemotherapy for a total of five days. Longer treatment periods, while difficult to integrate with fasting, may still be combined with a higher-calorie FMD with the oncologist’s approval. 2. We have rarely seen major side effects caused by FMDs, and all occurred when people made their own fasting or FMD; one patient showed an increase in liver toxicity markers while doing her own fast while receiving a chemo cocktail. Several patients fainted while taking hot showers after multiple days of fasting—probably because of the reduction in blood pressure and glucose levels. Another FMD-related risk: resuming regular eating habits immediately following chemotherapy could cause liver damage due to the combination of hepatotoxic drugs and the proliferation of liver cells. For this reason, it is important to wait a minimum of 24 hours after the chemotherapy is administered before resuming a normal diet. 3. While most people can safely drive or operate machinery while fasting, a few will be impaired. When in doubt, avoid both activities during the fasting period. 4. Starting 24 hours after chemotherapy, the patient should eat only rice, pasta, bread or a similar source of carbohydrates, vegetables, and vegetable soups, and some fruit for a full 24 hours. Then a normal diet can be resumed, paying particular attention to nourishment (vitamins, minerals, protein, and essential fats). 5. The patient should try to return to regular body weight before undertaking another fasting cycle. 6. With regard to weight loss caused by fasting, obese patients should consult their personal physician on the advisability of maintaining their new weight or regaining what they lost. 7. Diabetic patients should not undergo fasting unless it is approved by their diabetologist or endocrinologist. 8. Patients should not fast while taking metformin, insulin, or similar drugs. 9. Patients on hypertension medication should speak to their doctor about blood-pressure drops caused by fasting and the risk of combining fasting with medications. 10. Until clinical trials are completed, fasting will remain an experimental procedure and should be considered only with the approval of a patient’s oncologist in combination with standard-of-care therapies, preferably as part of a clinical trial and when other options are not available or are known to be ineffective. 11. Between fasting cycles, we recommend that cancer patients maintain a low-sugar, mostly plant-based, low-protein but otherwise high-nourishment diet which allow them to maintain a healthy weight and normal BMI. A registered dietitian should be consulted to avoid malnourishment and unwanted weight loss (see the Longevity Diet in chapter 4 [chapter004.xhtml]).NUTRITION AND FMD FOR CANCER PREVENTIONAlthough the Longevity Diet (see chapter 4 [chapter004.xhtml]) can be generallyapplied for cancer prevention, it has the potential to be especially beneficialfor people with certain genetic mutations—such as the BRCA genes—which put themat a greatly increased risk of cancer. Prophylactic mastectomies and othersurgical procedures can reduce the incidence of genetically induced cancers, butnutrition and FMD may also help. Dietary interventions additionally have thepotential to reduce the chance of recurrence in previously diagnosed patientswhose cancer is in remission. It is important to stress that patients should notattempt to replace prophylactic mastectomies with nutritional interventionswhose efficacy remains to be established.image [../images/9781405933940_TheLongevityDiet_032_IMGX.jpg]7.6. Insulin-like growth factor-1, associated with cancer and aging, is reducedmore effectively, after three cycles of FMD in individuals at risk for cancer(>225, or with IGF-1 levels above 225 ng/mL at the beginning of the trial)BELOW ARE DIETARY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PEOPLE AT HIGH RISK FOR CANCER: 1. Follow the Longevity Diet, described in chapter 4 [chapter004.xhtml], with protein intake reduced to the lower range of about 0.31 grams per pound of body weight per day. 2. Limit fish intake to one or two times a week; otherwise stick to plant-based foods. 3. Reduce sugars to very low levels. Also minimize the consumption of pasta and breads. It is important to keep blood-sugar levels as low as possible within the safe range. 4. Maintain a healthy weight and BMI (see chapter 4 [chapter004.xhtml]). 5. Exercise regularly (see chapter 5 [chapter005.xhtml]). 6. Undergo a five-day FMD every one to three months, depending on your weight and health status (once every three to six months if you are very healthy with ideal weight and abdominal fat; once every month if you are overweight or obese and at high risk for cancer). Remember that in mouse studies, FMD was as effective as chemotherapy against cancer. Instead of damaging normal tissues and organs, it protected them. 7. Nourish yourself with essential fatty acids (omega-3 and omega-6), vitamins, and minerals from a variety of vegetables (broccoli, carrots, green peppers, tomatoes, garbanzo beans, lentils, peas, black beans, etc.) and fish (salmon, anchovies). Your immune system is one of the major defenses against cancer. The diet must be balanced to kill cancerous or precancerous cells without causing deficiencies in your immune system or hormonal changes that can make you frail. See the high-nourishment diet examples at the end of this book. 8. Discuss with your oncologist the option of taking 6 grams of vitamin C or Ester-C® daily for a few weeks every 6 months. Multiple studies have demonstrated vitamin C to possess cancer-fighting properties, although its effectiveness in preventing cancer is controversial. Either way, vitamin C taken for a few weeks every 6 months at this level is not known to have major side effects, and the patient and doctor could consider continuing high-level vitamin C consumption for longer periods. 9. Consume plenty of good fats from olive oil, nuts, and fish, but minimize saturated fats, even those that are vegetable-derived. 10. Consume as little alcohol as possible.Our clinical trials looking into FMD and cancer prevention and treatment areongoing, but if early results are any indication, it could be a powerful newweapon in the arsenal we have to fight, and one day defeat, cancer. Next up, alook at our studies into FMD and diabetes."},{"pageContent":"Penguin walking logo [../images/PCHI_1.gif]CHAPTER 8NUTRITION, FMD, AND DIABETES PREVENTION AND TREATMENTFN1 [footnotes.xhtml#fn-2]> [For their review of this chapter, I thank Hanno Pijl, endocrinologist,> diabetologist, and director of the Clinic for Endocrinology and Metabolic> Disease at Leiden University, and Clayton Frenzel, bariatric surgeon.]TYPE 2 DIABETESType 2 diabetes, by far the most common of the two types, affects more than 27million people in the United States; an additional 86 million people haveprediabetes, meaning they have elevated risk factors for diabetes. According tothe World Health Organization, the number of people diagnosed with diabetesglobally has more than quadrupled in the past thirty-five years, from 100million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014. The disease is diagnosed by measuringthe average level of glucose in the blood (by an HbA1c test), or by detectingglucose levels above 125 mg/dL after an overnight fast—this latter measure isknown as one’s “fasting glucose level.” Typical symptoms include high thirst,frequent urination, blurry vision, irritability, numbness of the hands or feet,and fatigue.In type 2 diabetes, the pancreas produces insulin, but muscle cells, livercells, and fat cells do not respond properly to it. When cells becomeinsulin-resistant, glucose accumulates in the blood. You can think of insulin asthe key needed to unlock the gate that lets glucose enter the cells, but alsothe key that closes the door that allows glucose to be released by the liver. Intype 2 diabetic patients, that key isn’t working properly, the gate doesn’t opencompletely, and glucose cannot enter cells at the normal rate.But the damage to normal cells begins well before diabetes is diagnosed. Peoplewho are obese or overweight with high levels of abdominal fat have a far greaterchance of developing diabetes and prediabetes (when fasting glucose levels arebetween 100 and 125 mg/dL).The risk for diabetes is sixfold higher among women with body mass index (BMI)of 25 than those with a BMI of 21. For a five-foot-five-inch-tall woman, this isthe difference between weighing 154 pounds and 130 pounds. A similar effect isobserved in men with a BMI of 27.5 and 22, which indicates that afive-foot-eight-inch-tall male weighing 152 pounds would have a risk fordiabetes that is five times lower than that of a man of the same height weighing191 pounds (see fig. 8.1 [chapter008.xhtml#lon0000644s]).1[chapter008_notes.xhtml#ch08-1]image [../images/9781405933940_TheLongevityDiet_033_IMGX.jpg]image [../images/9781405933940_TheLongevityDiet_034_IMGX.jpg]8.1. Diabetes onset risk increases with higher body mass indexAnother study indicates the best way to assess risk for diabetes is by measuringabdominal fat via waist circumference. Men with a waist measurement above fortyinches and women with a waist measurement above thirty-four inches are at thehighest risk.2 [chapter008_notes.xhtml#ch08-2]NUTRITION, WEIGHT MANAGEMENT, AND DIABETES PREVENTIONMaintaining an ideal weight will minimize the chance of developing diabetes. Weknow from both human and monkey studies that a severely calorie-restricted dietcan either completely prevent diabetes, as in monkeys, or, as in humans, causesuch a dramatic reduction in fasting glucose levels and abdominal fat that itwould be highly unlikely that these individuals would develop diabetes.3[chapter008_notes.xhtml#ch08-3]However, the great majority of people cannot maintain a 30 percentcalorie-restricted diet, and don’t want to give up most of the foods they enjoy;nor should they want to lose large quantities of muscle mass or become too thin,which would be unavoidable after prolonged calorie restriction. Also, severalstudies indicate calorie restriction does not reduce fasting glucose among obesepeople the same way it does among people starting from a normal weight.4[chapter008_notes.xhtml#ch08-4] To prevent diabetes, then, it is important toidentify strategies better suited to a majority of people.In the following section, I present both the everyday dietary changes and theperiodic fasting-mimicking diets that can be adopted to prevent and help reversediabetes.THE LONGEVITY DIET FOR DIABETES PREVENTION AND POTENTIAL REVERSALAdopting the Longevity Diet described in chapter 4 [chapter004.xhtml] can helpprevent and has the potential to reverse diabetes in some subjects. Not onlywill it help you maintain or reach a healthy weight and abdominal fatlevel—especially when combined with the exercise guidelines in chapter 5[chapter005.xhtml]—but also it may reduce diabetes incidence independently ofweight. Here are specific dietary interventions that can help prevent and treatdiabetes: 1. Eat within twelve hours or fewer per day. In chapter 4 [chapter004.xhtml], I discussed the research related to a healthy time period for daily eating. A five-foot-two woman weighing 154 pounds who normally eats breakfast at 8 a.m. and has a late-night snack at 11 p.m. is eating for fifteen hours a day. This probably affects her weight and possibly her sleep.5 [chapter008_notes.xhtml#ch08-5] One simple strategy for dropping to a healthier weight is to reduce the eating period to eleven or twelve hours per day—in the above example, this would mean eating the last snack by 7 or 8 p.m. This technique can be adjusted to further regulate weight. For example, if limiting food intake to eleven to twelve hours per day isn’t sufficient, it can be limited to ten or even eight hours per day (8 a.m. to 6 p.m., or 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.), although limiting the food intake period to less than eleven to twelve hours could have side effects including gallstones. Furthermore, a number of studies indicate that skipping breakfast could have a negative effect on overall health and increase cardiovascular disease.6 [chapter008_notes.xhtml#ch08-6] However, restricting food intake to an eleven- to twelve-hour window every day is often observed in very long-lived populations, so this more permissive time frame is probably a safer choice until further studies become available. 2. Be nourished: eat more, not less, but better. As discussed in chapter 4 [chapter004.xhtml], if you ate 5.3 ounces of pasta or pizza with 5.3 ounces of cheese, you could be consuming 1,100 calories in a relatively small portion that is deficient in important vitamins and minerals. If you instead ate 1.4 ounces of pasta (about 140 calories) and an additional 14 ounces of garbanzo beans (about 330 calories) plus 11 ounces of mixed vegetables (about 210 calories) and 0.5 ounce of olive oil (about 120 calories), you would reach only 800 calories, while eating a large portion rich in proteins, healthy fats, complex carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals.Option A (wrong choice)5.3 oz. pasta (540 calories) + 5.3 oz. cheese (550 calories) + 2 oz. sauce (20calories)Option B (right choice)1.4 oz. pasta (about 140 calories) + 14 oz. garbanzo beans (soaked and drained,about 330 calories) + 11 oz. mixed vegetables (about 210 calories) + 0.5 oz.olive oil (120 calories)image [../images/9781405933940_TheLongevityDiet_045_IMGX.jpg]8.2. Option A = 12.6 ounces, 1,110 calories; Option B = 27 ounces, 800 caloriesOption B is obviously a better choice, for multiple reasons: * Option B provides enough proteins and more vitamins, minerals, healthy fats, and other nutrients, which can nourish and signal satiety to the brain. * It causes a lower release of insulin. * It requires eating food weighing more than twice as much as Option A, therefore filling and expanding the stomach and sending the brain additional signals of satiety, while providing 30 percent fewer calories. * It replaces the bad saturated animal fats contained in cheese with the protective monounsaturated fats contained in olive oil. * For many people, Option B will eventually even taste better than Option A, because saturated fats and sugars tend to cover the flavor of other ingredients. * Many will also feel lighter and avoid acid reflux or heartburn, despite having eaten twice as much food. Of course, some people consuming large meals, particularly at night, may experience acid reflux even if a meal like Option B is consumed. In this case, it’s best to talk to a specialized doctor and reduce your meal size. 3. Eat two meals a day plus a snack. As also noted in chapter 4 [chapter004.xhtml], eating small meals five or six times a day is generally a bad idea, particularly for people who are gaining unwanted weight or needing to lose weight. The ideal strategy to maintain or lose weight is to eat a light breakfast plus lunch and then have a snack or very light meal for dinner, as is the norm in several very long-lived populations. The other option is to have a light breakfast, a snack for lunch, and a larger dinner. Note that for some people, especially older and sick people, one large meal per day may cause indigestion or acid reflux, in which case it may be necessary to move the larger meal to earlier in the day or go back to breakfast plus two smaller meals per day instead of one larger one. If in doubt and if at all possible, you can consult with a dietitian to determine the best strategy. 4. Maximize complex carbohydrates (whole grains, vegetables, legumes); reduce pasta, rice, and bread; and minimize sugar and bad fat. Even once you reach an ideal weight and waist circumference, the levels of sugars or starches (rice, pasta, bread, soft drinks, etc.) as well as the levels of saturated fats (cheese, butter, candy, etc.) must be minimized. The liver uses excess sugars to generate fats, which can be stored there or transported to various storage sites including the abdomen (visceral fat) and to areas under the skin throughout the body (subcutaneous fat). The role of fat intake in obesity and diseases is very controversial. In the past, it was commonly believed that a high-fat diet leads to obesity. We now know that while a high-fat diet can also contribute to obesity, it’s a high-sugar, high-starch diet that deserves a lot of the blame. As for a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet, while it’s true that in most cases this regimen will result in weight loss, a significant portion of that loss comes from water and muscle. In addition, the high-fat and high-protein diet, in the long run, is the worst of all possible regimens both in terms of overall mortality and the incidence of cancer or death from cancer (see chapter 4 [chapter004.xhtml]). Good fats—particularly those coming from olive oil and nuts (walnuts, almonds, hazelnuts)—have been consistently associated with health and longevity. Consume a handful of nuts every day and pour olive oil generously on salads and other dishes. 5. Adopt a low but sufficient protein diet. Although obesity is known to increase one’s risk of diabetes, protein intake may be just as big of a factor. One study following forty thousand men for up to twenty years showed a twofold increased risk for diabetes associated with a low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet.7 [chapter008_notes.xhtml#ch08-7] Those results are consistent with our 2014 study of six thousand people in the United States indicating increased diabetes risk in those with the highest protein intake, although the small population size limited the significance of our results.8 [chapter008_notes.xhtml#ch08-8] Two of our papers we published in 2011 and 2015 studied diseases in one hundred Laron syndrome patients living in Ecuador. Because of the mutation in the growth hormone receptor gene (GHR), they experience dwarfism and become obese at a higher rate than their relatives who live in the same communities and eat the same diet but do not have Laron syndrome. Even though obesity is one of the major risk factors for diabetes, not one of the Laron subjects in Ecuador has developed diabetes. Because proteins are the major regulators of the growth hormone gene, these results are in agreement with the papers discussed above, and similarly suggest that high protein intake may promote diabetes in part by increasing the activity of growth hormone and the growth factor IGF-1, associated at high levels with multiple diseases. The absence of growth hormone receptor (which can be viewed as having an effect similar to that of eating a very low-protein diet) eliminates or reduces drastically obesity’s causal effect on diabetes. In fact, mice with defects in the growth hormone receptor are also protected from diabetes—results that support our conclusions in humans. The strongest proof for our hypothesis came in 2015, when we measured glucose tolerance in the Laron syndrome group. Far from being insulin-resistant, they turned out to be insulin-sensitive, meaning their insulin worked better than normal even in overweight or obese individuals.9 [chapter008_notes.xhtml#ch08-9] Because insulin resistance is the key cause of diabetes, this insight may explain why none of the Ecuador Laron patients have yet developed this metabolic disease.The above recommendations for preventing diabetes may also be beneficial fortreatment of the disease, although, as with the cancer recommendations, furtherstudies are necessary to demonstrate this effect.FASTING AND FASTING-MIMICKING DIETS IN DIABETES TREATMENT5:2 DIETTwo major short-term interventions involving some form of fasting have beendemonstrated to be effective against multiple diabetes risk factors (excludinginterventions that use severe calorie restriction lasting weeks to months). Oneof them is the periodic FMD developed by my laboratory. The other, developed byDr. Michelle Harvie of the University of Manchester—and subsequently modifiedand popularized as the “5:2” diet by doctor and journalist MichaelMosley—involved overweight subjects who, for two days a week during a six-monthperiod, consumed only 500 to 600 calories of relatively high-protein foods. Theylost abdominal fat and displayed improved insulin sensitivity and reduced bloodpressure.10 [chapter008_notes.xhtml#ch08-10] The diet had a limited effect onglucose levels for overweight patients, however, indicating that longertreatment periods may be necessary for diabetes patients.11[chapter008_notes.xhtml#ch08-11] The advantage of this diet is that it requiresminimal medical supervision. The disadvantage is that most obese and diabetespatients may find it difficult to remain on this diet for years, since itrequires severe dietary restriction for two days every week. Further studieswill be necessary to determine what the effects will be on diabetes patients.A concern yet to be addressed is that alternating between a 2,000-calorie dietand a 500-calorie diet could trigger metabolic and sleep disorders resemblingjet lag. Nonetheless, the 5:2 diet has been tried by thousands of people,particularly to lose weight, and many report a range of positive effects whilebeing on it. Doctors should decide with their patients whether it may beincorporated into diabetes prevention or treatment therapies, preferably incombination with standard of care or as part of clinical trials.FMD AND DIABETES TREATMENTDiabetes drugs will interfere with or activate enzymes that can lowerblood-glucose levels, but they will not target the multiple root causes fordiabetes—some of which are understood and some of which are still emerging. Theresults of our one-hundred-patient randomized clinical trial are very promising:they show that undergoing three monthly cycles of the five-day FMD formulated tomimic fasting (750 to 1,100 calories per day) will lower many of the major riskfactors for diabetes and metabolic syndrome, which increases the risk for heartdisease, diabetes, and stroke.METABOLIC REPROGRAMMING AND REGENERATION TO TREAT DIABETESScientists are wary of the word “cure” because it sounds like an exaggeration.However, for some patients with type 2 diabetes and the great majority ofprediabetic patients, the combination of the dietary interventions describedabove could lead to a cure. I’m not saying everyone would be cured or that it’seasy for diabetes patients to execute this plan. But the mouse and human dataindicate that some and potentially many patients who follow the chronic dietarychanges outlined in the first part of this chapter, or the periodic FMD, andpreferably both, could eventually be free of type 2 diabetes, the most commontype, especially if the treatment is started right after the initial diagnosis,when the pancreas is still functioning well. Note, as described below, that thecombination of diabetes drugs and fasting or fasting-mimicking diets isdangerous and should be done as part of a clinical trial. Note also thatalthough all the data, including clinical data, underline the high potential ofthese dietary changes in effectively treating diabetes, this will have to bedemonstrated in a large randomized clinical trial and approved by the FDA beforeit can be prescribed to patients as a replacement for standard-of-care drugs fordiabetes treatment. However, dietary interventions can serve as support to FDAapproved therapies.image [../images/9781405933940_TheLongevityDiet_036_IMGX.jpg]8.3. Changes in risk factors for diabetes and metabolic syndrome and otherdiseases from a 100-subject randomized clinical trial testing three monthlycycles of the FMD. The figure reports effects in both low-risk (left) andhigh-risk (right) participants.However, if you are at high risk for or suffer from diabetes, I encourage you totalk to your doctor and consider changing your everyday diet now, both fordiabetes prevention and treatment. Our studies in mice and humans indicate thatthe FMD can prevent or potentially reverse diabetes by doing the following: 1. Reducing abdominal and liver fat. FMD pushes the body into a high fat-burning mode, mainly using abdominal/visceral fat but also liver fat, which are central to the promotion of diabetes and other diseases. Mice that undergo two cycles of the FMD a month, while eating the same total calories per month as mice on the regular diet, continue to lose weight, which suggests the fat-burning mode continues even after resuming a normal diet (see fig. 8.4 [chapter008.xhtml#lon0000694s]).image [../images/9781405933940_TheLongevityDiet_037_IMGX.jpg]8.4. Mice exposed to a fasting-mimicking diet lose weight while eating the sameper month 2. Promoting fat loss without muscle loss. In the human clinical trial, obese participants lost approximately 9 pounds after three cycles of the FMD, and overweight participants lost an average of 4.5 pounds. However, the loss of lean body mass was either not observed or very small. 3. Cell renewal/regeneration and autophagy. By causing many damaged and old cells in different systems to die or reset, FMD flushes out bad cells and spurs regeneration inside the cell (autophagy) as well as new cell production through stem cell activation. This leads to regeneration and rejuvenation. In mice, we have demonstrated this process occurring in multiple systems, including the blood, the brain, the muscle, the liver, and the pancreas. In humans, data from clinical trials suggest the same regenerative process is occurring. Healthy subjects with low blood glucose or low blood pressure experienced little or no change after FMD cycles, protecting them from levels sinking dangerously low. However, the effects of FMD on glucose, blood pressure, and other risk factors for diabetes were much stronger in people who already had evidence of risk factors for aging and diseases at the beginning of the study (see fig. 8.3 [chapter008.xhtml#lon0000691s]). These effects in humans, together with the data from mice, indicate either a rejuvenation or a regeneration of the damaged cells, or both. If muscle cells that respond poorly to insulin are either repaired, rejuvenated, or regenerated, they can return to their normal function. (Not surprisingly, insulin resistance is relatively rare in young people, particularly in the non-obese, but is very common in older people, even if they are not obese.)image [../images/9781405933940_TheLongevityDiet_038_IMGX.jpg]8.5. FMD cycles promote pancreatic regeneration to restore insulin productionand reverse both type 1 and type 2 diabetes in miceFMD, PANCREATIC REGENERATION, AND REVERSAL OF TYPE 1 AND TYPE 2 DIABETES IN MICEIn a recent paper, we showed that cycles of the FMD, in addition to improvingthe function of insulin, could promote the regeneration of insulin-producingbeta cells and the reversal of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes symptoms in micein which the pancreas could not generate sufficient insulin, resulting in veryhigh glucose levels.12 [chapter008_notes.xhtml#ch08-12] Remarkably, the FMDcaused the activation of many pancreatic genes normally activated duringembryonic/fetal development, suggesting that it can trigger a natural and highlycoordinated regenerative response able to result in new and functioning betacells, which can make normal levels of insulin.A note about insulin and water-only fasting or similar: While death in peopleundergoing a prolonged fasting period is rare, when it did occur, it was inseveral cases associated with insulin use. A few patients have died by combiningfasting with an insulin injection, probably because insulin normally workspoorly in diabetes patients, and fasting partially reverses this effect. Thesame insulin injection that normally decreases glucose to healthy levels in adiabetic patient can cause a much more precipitous drop in a diabetic patientwho is fasting—resulting in hypoglycemic shock and, in some cases, death.Similar albeit reduced dangers apply to the use of the fasting-mimicking diet.A CAUTIONARY TALE (WITH A HAPPY ENDING)I want to share an email I received from a stranger. It reinforces how powerfulthe periodic FMD and the daily Longevity Diet can be in preventing and treatingdisease, but it also demonstrates the dangers of self-treatment. This diabeticpatient risked his life by combining insulin-like drugs with his own version ofmy Longevity Diet, and doing so without consulting his doctor.> Dear Dr. Longo,> > You don’t know it, but you saved my life. In December, I started my descent to> hell with a paralysis of my left leg. By the night of Christmas I was in the> hospital. A series of endless blood exams did not identify anything alarming> but strong acid reflux, bad digestion, and continuous vomiting.

Keep in mind that I’m a diabetic person (insulin, NovoRapid 18 units> 3 times per day, 22 units of Lantus at night—metformin pills and blood> pressure medications). I adopted the diet described by you at the end of June,> and everything changed. The results: 230 pounds, I walk/run for 3 miles per> day and I’m taking a diving class.

My doctors did not> believe how well I was doing and wanted a copy of the article.Fortunately, the patient did not adopt the FMD, only the Longevity Diet. Butthat was enough to resensitize his cells to insulin and cause severehypoglycemia at night. He risked his life by making such a drastic changewithout consulting a doctor experienced in diet and diabetes to advise himduring the transition. Had he also adopted the FMD, the combination of that andhis diabetes drugs could have killed him.The results of my research may have proven beneficial for this patient, but ifyou are diabetic I strongly discourage his self-administered approach. The bigmistake, of course, was combining the diet with insulin. With just one visit tothe right doctor before adopting the same diet and perhaps a periodic FMD, hecould have done even better without risking hypoglycemic shock.If your doctor resists helping you treat or prevent diabetes with dietaryinterventions, you should insist. It the doctor still refuses, look for amedical doctor specialized in integrative medicine, or contact L-Nutra and askfor a specialized doctor in their network.I am not suggesting that conventional therapies do not work. But I believemedical doctors should prioritize therapies aimed at curing the patient, notjust those that slow down the progression of disease. Recently I launched atraining program to educate biologists, nutritionists, and medical doctors onthe Longevity Diet and FMD. I hope to establish a network of specializedprofessionals in many countries to oversee patients wishing to use the dietarystrategies described in this book.TREATING OBESITYMost of my work is geared toward preventing or finding a cure for commondiseases, in most cases by acting on the aging process, and therefore therepair, protection, and regeneration of cellular components, cells, and organs.Usually I focus on animal and clinical studies related to obesity, diabetes,cancer, heart disease, or Alzheimer’s, working at major universities and thehospitals associated with them. But every day people write to me, particularlywhen they’ve come to a dead end with traditional medicine. In such cases, Icollect data about the individual patient and extrapolate from currentscientific findings to devise a plan of action, which I then share with thepatient and his or her doctor. I want to share two extreme cases among these,involving obesity.CASE 1I received a letter from a woman who had decided to do her own FMD. She wrote,“I have now experienced 15 five-day cycles of FMD. In total, I have lost 40pounds (from 251 pounds to 211 pounds, that’s 2.5 pounds per cycle), althoughdue to a lack of availability of the ProLon FMD for about 10 months, I haveregained a total of 6 pounds. My blood pressure has decreased from approximately130 over 80 to approximately 120 over 70. During the three- to four-week periodbetween cycles, I have more energy and am able to work longer hours withoutlosing concentration.“I find that the diet is not what I would call ‘fun,’ in that I enjoy eating avaried international diet and would prefer that to the FMD. However, I find thatthe short (five-day) period is tolerable, in that I don’t feel hungry. Moreover,after five days I am able to resume my ‘normal’ diet and enjoy eating what Iwant. To maintain weight loss, I try not to binge, but I have an occasionalhamburger, a couple of frozen yogurts, and even a pastry between cycles, so itisn’t a difficult or major sacrifice.”CASE 2The second case involves an obese man I helped who had tried everything to loseweight but nothing worked. He started at an unhealthy 245 pounds with a 50-inchwaist and a 38 percent body fat composition, which placed him at a very highrisk for developing diabetes. He did three cycles of the FMD and his weight,blood pressure, C-reactive protein (CRP; a measure of inflammation), and bloodglucose levels all improved. The improvements were not major, however, becausebetween cycles he would return to a high-fat, high-sugar, and high-starch dietand gain most of the weight back. I told him that considering his high diseaserisk, he should undergo four back-to-back cycles of the FMD diet under medicalsupervision.I knew that fasting clinics regularly place patients on a 200-calorie-per-daydiet for four weeks with few problems, so three weeks on FMD, providing at least750 calories per day, was reasonable if the patient were very careful and workedclosely with me and his doctor.This strategy resulted in a loss of 30 pounds, a lot of it abdominal fat, and amajor gain in energy and well-being. One year later, he had maintained his bodyweight and reported that FMD had changed his eating habits.Clearly this multiple (two or more) FMD-cycle approach should be considered onlywhen periodic cycles fail. Multiple cycles like these must be done with theapproval and close monitoring of a doctor, preferably one who specializes inprolonged fasting therapies. Several potential side effects can result from thisapproach if it is followed improperly or if the wrong foods are consumed. Thoseside effects include an excessive drop in blood pressure or blood glucose, andmalnourishment (deficiencies in certain vitamins, minerals, or essentialnutrients). FMD can also produce a number of potential drug interactions, makinga prolonged approach dangerous to some—for example, people receiving insulintherapy. Another concern is related to combining this major weight loss with amajor weight gain. Multiple studies have shown that cycles of major weight lossfollowed by major weight regain can increase cardiovascular disease in bothnormal subjects and those already suffering from heart disease.13[chapter008_notes.xhtml#ch08-13]Based on the abovementioned studies, it is particularly important to avoidweight losses and regains, thus the patient must be committed to continuing theFMD once a month after undergoing multiple consecutive FMD cycles. Please notethat ProLon or any other FMD is only a tool that doctors can use to help manageobesity. We are now working toward performing clinical trials as part of the FDAapproval process, but it takes time. Until that day, the information in thischapter provides a solid basis for dietary interventions that may complementstandard diabetes prevention and treatment.Next, a look at our very promising early studies into the Longevity Diet andFMD’s positive countereffects on cardiovascular disease."},{"pageContent":"Penguin walking logo [../images/PCHI_1.gif]CHAPTER 9FMD, NUTRITION, AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE PREVENTION AND TREATMENTFN1[footnotes.xhtml#fn-3]> [For their review of this chapter, I thank Kurt Hong, MD, PhD, associate> professor and director of the USC Center for Clinical Nutrition, Los Angeles,> and Andreas Michalsen, head physician at the Experimental and Clinical> Research Center, Charité–University Medicine Berlin.

That’s about one in three deaths. In addition, around92 million Americans are living with some form of cardiovascular disease or theaftereffects of a stroke. Costs related to treatment and lost productivity areprojected at around $316 billion. Clearly the drugs and other interventionsbeing prescribed have not been very effective, and therefore the everydayLongevity Diet and FMD have the potential to reduce CVD incidence andprogression. When it comes to cardiovascular disease, two very long studies onmonkeys, conducted over decades, as well as multiple human studies serve asevidence of the power of certain diets in combating this widespread problem. Ibegin with a brief explanation of what they show us and where we can go fromhere.PREVENTING CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE IN MONKEYSWith a DNA sequence that is 93 percent identical to ours, rhesus macaques areperhaps the most humanlike organism in which we can study how lifespan respondsto dietary interventions. They have a maximum lifespan of approximately fortyyears, making it possible to study them over a long but manageable period oftime, and they develop many of the same diseases we do—including diabetes,cancer, and cardiovascular disease. Two monumental studies, one at theUniversity of Wisconsin and one at the US National Institute on Aging (NIA),have measured how restricting calories by approximately 30 percent for lifeaffects longevity and disease in rhesus monkeys.The Wisconsin study, headed by Dr. Richard Weindruch, which ran for more thantwenty years, concluded that a calorie-restricted (CR) diet lowers monkeymortality rates to 26 percent, compared with a 63 percent death rate in thecontrol group.1 [chapter009_notes.xhtml#ch09-1]Forty-two percent of the monkeys on the regular diet developed prediabetes ordiabetes, but none of the CR animals were diagnosed with either. In addition,cardiovascular diseases were reduced by 50 percent in the CR animals.2[chapter009_notes.xhtml#ch09-2]In contrast to the Wisconsin study, the NIA study, led by Rafael de Cabo, foundno apparent difference in the cause of death between the control and CR groups.Both groups showed a similar distribution of cardiovascular disease,amyloidosis, neoplasia, and general health deterioration.3[chapter009_notes.xhtml#ch09-3]The difference between these two decades-long studies on diet in monkeysunderscores the importance of diet composition in addition to limiting calories.In the NIA study, the control group received a healthy diet in which proteinswere derived mainly from plant-based sources, including wheat, corn, soybean,and alfalfa, plus fish. Protein provided 17.3 percent of total calorie intake,along with 5 percent fat, 5 percent fiber, and 3.9 percent sucrose, plusvitamins and minerals. Finally, the animals were fed only twice a day, and theirportions were adjusted for the age and body weight of each individual monkey.In the University of Wisconsin study, milk (lactalbumin) was the only source ofprotein. The diet contained 10 percent fat (primarily from corn oil), 5 percentcellulose, and 28.5 percent sucrose. Unlike those in the NIA study, theWisconsin monkeys in the control group were allowed to eat as much as theywanted, to better represent the typical Western diet.In other words, the NIA control-group monkeys were kept to a healthy weight on adiet with similarities to the Longevity Diet described in this book, whereas theWisconsin monkeys in the control group were on an animal-protein-based,high-sugar diet and were allowed to gain some weight. It is not surprising,then, that calorie restriction in the Wisconsin study was highly protectiveagainst aging and diseases, because the CR monkeys were being compared withcontrol monkeys eating an unhealthy diet. The NIA control group, in contrast,was eating such a healthy diet that restricting it by 30 percent did notnoticeably affect aging or most diseases, underlining the importance of theeveryday diet, and supporting my conclusion throughout the book that for peoplewho maintain an ideal longevity diet, the periodic FMD could be limited to twicea year.DIET AND PREVENTION OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASENow back to humans. In chapter 4 [chapter004.xhtml], I described the idealLongevity Diet (which takes into account the Wisconsin and NIA monkey studies).However, milder versions of this diet exist, and their beneficial effects havebeen investigated in many studies. One of the most studied diets that has beenshown to have effects on aging and disease, including cardiovascular disease, isthe Mediterranean diet in its strictest form. The science behind its efficacy isrooted mostly in one of the Five Pillars—epidemiology—since few clinical trialsand molecular studies have been carried out. Data from studies of centenariansshow that extreme longevity has little to do with the Mediterranean diet per se.It is instead associated with specific ingredients and how heavily they arefeatured in diets common to the Mediterranean, Okinawa, Loma Linda, and CostaRica. In other words, the Mediterranean diet appears to be a very good choice,but if we keep in mind all the pillars, the Longevity Diet, which includes theperiodic FMD outlined in chapters 4 [chapter004.xhtml] and 6 [chapter006.xhtml],has the potential to be much more beneficial. Those unable to strictly followthat diet could still benefit by adding some components typical of both theLongevity and the Mediterranean diets.image [../images/9781405933940_TheLongevityDiet_039_IMGX.jpg]Many studies have shown that the Mediterranean diet described above isassociated with reduced incidence of chronic diseases, including cardiovasculardisease.4 [chapter009_notes.xhtml#ch09-4] For example, a study at the Universityof Florence looked at data obtained from 4.1 million subjects and found a clearcorrelation between a lower risk for cardiovascular disease and a greateradherence to the Mediterranean diet.5 [chapter009_notes.xhtml#ch09-5]As with the Longevity Diet, consumption of olive oil and nuts is consistentlyassociated with longevity and protection from cardiovascular disease. Tounderstand whether olive oil and nuts in fact provide protection from diseases,a study at Spain’s Barcelona University followed 7,447 men and women agesfifty-eight to eighty at risk for developing cardiovascular disease. Thesesubjects consumed a Mediterranean diet supplemented with either one liter ofextra-virgin olive oil per week or with 30 grams of mixed nuts (15 grams ofwalnuts, 7.5 grams of hazelnuts, 7.5 grams of almonds). Subjects in the controlgroup instead consumed a reduced-fat diet.6 [chapter009_notes.xhtml#ch09-6] Theresearch team observed a reduction in cardiovascular events (stroke, heartattack, etc.) in both the Mediterranean diet group supplemented with olive oiland the one supplemented with nuts.7 [chapter009_notes.xhtml#ch09-7] More thanfive years later, observation of the same group revealed that the intake ofmono- and polyunsaturated fats, such as those contained in olive and othervegetable oils, was associated with reduced cardiovascular disease, but a dietrich in saturated and trans fats increased cardiovascular disease.8[chapter009_notes.xhtml#ch09-8] Notably, the intake of saturated fats from fishand plant-based sources (nuts, etc.) was associated with reduced cardiovasculardisease and death.9 [chapter009_notes.xhtml#ch09-9]A Harvard study, discussed earlier, of nearly 130,000 men and women—whichrecorded more than 20,000 deaths, 5,204 of those from cardiovasculardisease—showed that those in the group on a low-carbohydrate, mostlyanimal-based, high-protein diet were twice as likely to die of any cause, andhad a 40 percent higher risk of dying of cardiovascular disease.10[chapter009_notes.xhtml#ch09-10] When the diet was vegetable-based but still lowin carbohydrates, it was no longer associated with higher cardiovasculardisease. In fact, it appeared to reduce diseases further.Another study following a large group of middle-aged men indicated that highintake of proteins from animal-based sources increased the rates of stroke andischemic heart disease, whereas a higher plant-based protein intake wasprotective.11 [chapter009_notes.xhtml#ch09-11]As we and others have shown, people with high vegetable-based protein intakenormally have lower or much lower overall protein intake, suggesting that thelower incidence of disease may be caused by both the beneficial effects ofplant-based food and the lower overall protein intake, compared with peopleeating high levels of animal-based proteins.A study of 43,396 women in Sweden reported a 5 percent increase in the incidenceof cardiovascular disease with each 5-gram increase in protein intake and20-gram reduction in carbohydrate intake.12 [chapter009_notes.xhtml#ch09-12]Another study evaluating 2,210 cases of nonfatal infarcts and 952 deaths fromheart disease also concluded that a high intake of red meat and fat correlateswith an elevated risk of heart disease in women, whereas intake of nuts andbeans reduces the risk.13 [chapter009_notes.xhtml#ch09-13]When my PhD adviser Roy Walford was in Biosphere 2, he and the other sevenresidents of the sealed environment in the Arizona desert were on acalorie-restricted diet for almost two years.14 [chapter009_notes.xhtml#ch09-14]Their meals, providing fewer than 1,800 calories a day, were mostlyvegetarian—consisting of fruits, grains, peas, beans, peanuts, greens, potatoes,plus other vegetables and small quantities of goat’s milk and yogurt (about 84grams per day), with very small quantities of goat meat, pork, fish, and eggs.15[chapter009_notes.xhtml#ch09-15] The eight Biospherians showed remarkablechanges in risk factors for cardiovascular diseases after adopting this diet.Several studies have confirmed the Biosphere 2 results and have also shown thatcalorie restriction reduces inflammation (CRP levels) and additional markersassociated with cardiovascular diseases.16 [chapter009_notes.xhtml#ch09-16]Taken together, these studies confirm that many of the risk factors for heartdisease and stroke can be prevented and even very effectively treated by veryspecific dietary interventions. However, as we saw with the rhesus monkeystudies, prolonged calorie restriction is an extreme intervention that producesboth benefits and problems.image [../images/9781405933940_TheLongevityDiet_040_IMGX.jpg]9.1. How the Biosphere 2 experiment influenced risk factors for cardiovasculardiseaseFor example, as figure 9.1 [chapter009.xhtml#lon0000798s] shows, the body massindex after chronic calorie restriction typically reaches a value of 19, evenfor men. The average BMI of a Holocaust survivor was 14.2. Approaching anemaciated state can have a wide range of negative consequences on wound healingand the ability to fight infectious diseases.We need to take advantage of what we learned from these powerfulcalorie-restriction studies and use this information to identify dietary andother effective interventions that don’t lead to excessive weight loss andpotentially severe side effects.DIET AND TREATMENT OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASESeveral studies have investigated the role of dietary intervention in thetreatment of cardiovascular diseases. In one randomized study from the 1990s,people were placed on the “Ornish diet,” named for UC San Francisco medicalresearcher Dean Ornish. The diet consists of no animal products, no caffeine, 10percent of calories from fat obtained from grains, vegetables, fruit, beans,legumes, or soy foods, and only 12 grams of sugar per day. Together with mild tomoderate exercise and stress management, study participants saw their risk ofdeveloping coronary atherosclerosis improve after just one year.17[chapter009_notes.xhtml#ch09-17] Twenty-three of the twenty-eight patients onthis diet showed regression of atherosclerosis; meanwhile, the health of thesubjects on the control diet declined.18 [chapter009_notes.xhtml#ch09-18]After five years on the Ornish diet, the study group’s positron emissiontomography (PET) scans showed abnormalities associated with heart disease haddecreased, compared with the control group’s scans, in measurements taken bothat rest and under drug-induced heart stress.19 [chapter009_notes.xhtml#ch09-19]A similar diet, tested first in a small group and eventually monitored in alarger group of patients diagnosed with cardiovascular disease, was designed byCleveland Clinic surgeon Caldwell Esselstyn. Similar to the Ornish diet,Esselstyn’s regimen contains no meat, poultry, fish, dairy, oil of any kind,nuts, or avocado. It allows vegetables, legumes, whole grains, and fruits.The focus of the Esselstyn diet is to maintain cholesterol at very low levels.In the original study, he placed twenty-four patients with severe coronaryartery disease on the diet and followed them for twelve years. In all eighteenpatients who stayed on the diet, coronary heart disease was either arrested orregressed. After twelve years, seventeen of the eighteen patients maintained acholesterol level of 145 mg/dL.However, there are several limitations to the Esselstyn and Ornish diets. First,because they are so restrictive, the chance of long-term compliance in thegeneral population is uncertain at best. Second, both diets overlook thebenefits of nuts, other plant-based fats, and fish. These foods have beenassociated with decreased, not increased, heart disease.20[chapter009_notes.xhtml#ch09-20] The consumption of fish, olive oil, and nuts insome combination is common among record-longevity populations, including theSeventh-day Adventists of Loma Linda (although most don’t eat fish), the Greeksof Ikaria, the Italians of Calabria and Sardinia, and the Japanese in Okinawa(although they don’t consume high levels of olive oil).Support for the inclusion of these foods extends beyond epidemiological,clinical, and centenarian studies. Calorie-restriction studies in humans havenot prohibited nuts, olive oil, other fats, or fish, yet they have reportedmajor decreases in total cholesterol. CR study subjects reached 125 mg/dL and 60low-density lipoprotein (LDL) mg/dL levels, both far lower than the 150 (total)and 80 (LDL) mg/dL that Esselstyn considers healthy levels providing highprotection against diseases.In summary, although the Esselstyn and Ornish diets appear to be effective inthe treatment of cardiovascular disease, I recommend talking to yourcardiologist about adopting the cardiovascular diseases treatment diet outlinedat the end of this chapter, which takes into account their studies together withthe Five Pillars of Longevity. My modifications allow the reintroduction ofrelatively high levels of nuts, olive oil, and certain fish containing highlevels of omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon. I also reduce the consumption offruit, pasta, bread, and daily proteins, which my research team and others haveassociated with a high risk of age-related diseases.PERIODIC FASTING-MIMICKING DIETS IN THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OFCARDIOVASCULAR DISEASEMy laboratory has focused on interventions that are simple and effective, andthat minimize changes people don’t want to make. Our approach withcardiovascular diseases is not based on blocking the activity of enzymes, suchas those that produce cholesterol or affect blood pressure. Rather, our goal isto switch on the body’s ability to promote cellular protection, regeneration,and rejuvenation, leading to improved function and a return to a more youthful,healthy state.As with cancer and diabetes, the effects of the periodic FMD on risk factors forcardiovascular diseases are impressive, although they need to be confirmed bylarger clinical studies.21 [chapter009_notes.xhtml#ch09-21] When we tested theFMD in humans, subjects displayed lower cardiovascular disease and inflammationmarkers after three diet cycles, without any adverse effects. Other findingsincluded reduced body weight and body fat without loss of lean mass.22[chapter009_notes.xhtml#ch09-22] Three cycles of the FMD performed once a monthfor five days, followed by a return to a normal diet, reduced abdominalcircumference in all participants by 1.6 inches.However, in general, FMD cycles were far more effective in individuals with highlevels of risk factors for cardiovascular diseases than they were in healthyindividuals. For example, systolic blood pressure dropped about 7 mmHg insubjects with moderately high blood pressure; triglycerides fell by 25 mg/dL insubjects with high triglycerides; and bad cholesterol (LDL) went down by nearly22 mg/dL among at-risk individuals. Notably, three cycles of the FMD returnedthe levels of CRP, an important inflammatory risk factor for cardiovasculardisease, to the normal range in the great majority of study subjects (figure 9.2[chapter009.xhtml#lon0000844s]).SUMMARY OF THE FMD AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, RESULTS OF CLINICAL TRIALS,PREVENTION, AND TREATMENTIn our human clinical study involving one hundred subjects, FMD cycles affectedmany of the major risk factors or markers contributing to or associated withcardiovascular diseases, particularly in individuals at high risk. The resultsof the FMD related to cardiovascular diseases include the following: 1. Reduced abdominal fat and circumference 2. Major drop in the inflammatory risk factor, C-reactive protein 3. Reduction in total and LDL cholesterol 4. Lowering of triglycerides 5. Reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure 6. Reduction in fasting glucoseThe following are my guidelines for the prevention and treatment ofcardiovascular disease:PREVENTION 1. Follow the Longevity Diet (chapter 4 [chapter004.xhtml]) and the exercise guidelines (chapter 5 [chapter005.xhtml]). 2. Undergo periodic fasting-mimicking diets. For very healthy individuals with no cardiovascular-disease risk factors, we recommend FMD once every six months. For those overweight with multiple risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, including a family history of heart disease or stroke, we recommend FMD once a month until normal weight is achieved, then it can be reduced according to the guidelines in chapter 6 [chapter006.xhtml].image [../images/9781405933940_TheLongevityDiet_041_IMGX.jpg]9.2. C-reactive protein, blood pressure, and LDL cholesterol, all risk factorsfor cardiovascular disease, decrease after three cycles of the FMDTREATMENTThe best and safest strategy is to talk to your cardiologist about takingcomponents of the Esselstyn, Ornish, Walford, and Longevity diets and combiningthem with new information emerging from clinical and epidemiological studiesdiscussed in this chapter. For more specifics on all the below guidelines, seechapter 4 [chapter004.xhtml]. * No: red meat, poultry, or other meats (excluding fish) * No: dairy * Yes: fish * Yes: large amounts of vegetables (best if organic) * Yes: legumes, including beans, lentils, garbanzo beans, peas (best if organic) * Yes: whole grains, including pasta and bread, but less than 100 grams per day * Yes: fruits, but only one or two a day (e.g., one apple or orange, two handfuls of blueberries, blackberries, or strawberries) * Yes: olive oil (about 80 grams per day) * Yes: nuts (about 30 grams a day of walnuts, almonds, or hazelnuts) * Limit all eating to eleven to twelve hours a day (e.g., between 8 a.m. and 7 or 8 p.m. only). * Limit meals to twice a day plus a low-sugar, high-fiber snack with fewer than 100 calories, if you are above BMI 25. * Limit sugar to less than 10 grams per day. * Eat approximately 0.31 to 0.36 grams of protein per pound of body weight per day. If you weigh 130 pounds, that comes to about 40 to 47 grams of protein per day, of which 30 grams should be consumed in a single meal to maximize muscle synthesis. * Exercise as directed in chapter 5 [chapter005.xhtml]. * The diet I propose differs from the Ornish diet in that it allows high levels of fat from fish, olive oil, and nuts. However, it does not go as far as the Barcelona study’s diet fat allowance, which permits close to one liter of olive oil per week. Because the Barcelona study diet clearly protects against cardiovascular disease, the diet presented here is a compromise that factors in decades of work and evidence produced by Ornish, Esselstyn, and others indicating that very low-fat intake may be preferable while also considering more recent studies suggesting that there is little evidence that a decreased consumption of olive oil and nuts will produce a beneficial effect. * Talk to your doctor about using the dietary treatments described here as an integrative strategy. * Undergo periodic FMD. Remind your doctor that hypertension medications should not be taken with FMD unless it is clear that your blood pressure will remain within the normal range.Remember, because the dietary interventions described in this chapter have notyet been tested in large randomized clinical trials for the treatment ofcardiovascular disease, they should be used only in support of standard of care.Our early results are certainly promising enough that you and your doctor shouldbear them in mind as we continue to work toward larger trials and FDA approval.The same goes for the next area we will look at, neurodegenerative diseases,especially Alzheimer’s and other dementias."},{"pageContent":"Penguin walking logo [../images/PCHI_1.gif]CHAPTER 10FMD AND NUTRITION IN THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF ALZHEIMER’S AND OTHERNEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASESFN1 [footnotes.xhtml#fn-4]> [For their review of this chapter, I thank neurologist Markus Bock, a> specialist in the application of the ketogenic diet and fasting-mimicking diet> at the Experimental and Clinical Research Center, Charité–University Medicine> Berlin, and Patrizio Odetti, chief of geriatrics at the University of Genova> San Martino Hospital.]Brain function and damage has long been a scholarly focus and passion of mine.As with aging, it represents a daunting scientific challenge. The brain iscommonly afflicted by diseases, including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, that aredevastating to sufferers and those around them. Yet I know and have spent timewith many very elderly people who remain sharp and witty into their nineties andhundreds. My goal is to help as many people as possible live to a very old agewith normal mental faculties. This chapter focuses mostly on Alzheimer’s diseaseand other dementias—specifically how nutrition and an FMD may affect theirincidence and progression. Although Parkinson’s disease is also one of myresearch group’s areas of interest, we have not yet completed studies related toit. We have high hopes that the Longevity Diet and FMD will have beneficialeffects on Parkinson’s, but it would be premature to speculate on possibleoutcomes before performing basic and clinical research on this disease.ALZHEIMER’S DISEASEAlzheimer’s disease (AD) accounts for 60 to 80 percent of all dementias. It ischaracterized by a loss of memory that interferes with normal daily tasks. Inthe early stages of the disease, patients have difficulty remembering newlyacquired information. Later they become disoriented, show changes in mood andbehavior, and often grow suspicious of family members or caregivers, whom theyfail to recognize and remember. As the memory loss becomes severe, patients mayhave difficulty speaking, walking, and even swallowing.When I first started working on AD in the laboratory of USC neurobiologist CalebFinch in 1997, the great promise in combatting the disease was a vaccine againsta protein called beta-amyloid, which accumulates in the brains of AD patientsand which scientists generally agree is somehow involved in the disease, sinceit is linked to both the hereditary and nonhereditary forms. Twenty years later,this strategy has yet to produce any effective treatment, and hundreds oflaboratories are still searching for a cure. It is also no longer clear thatbeta-amyloid accumulation has a primary causal role in the disease.While we continue to search for a cure though, even a five-year delay in theaverage age of Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis would cut the number of patients bynearly half, since onset occurs at such an advanced age that many patients woulddie of another cause before developing the disease. Thus, AD is an excellentcandidate for the use of dietary interventions such as the FMD, with wideeffects on the aging process, which could delay AD onset or progression.PREVENTION OF ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE IN MICENot surprisingly, the major risk factor for AD is aging. Incidence of thedisease increases by more than a hundredfold from age sixty to age ninety-five.Mouse studies have provided a platform for understanding Alzheimer’s disease,since the human genes known to cause AD can be introduced into the mouse genome,promoting some of the memory loss and learning deficits observed in Alzheimer’spatients.Again, it is sad that we must sacrifice mice to identify interventions forAlzheimer’s. But before we can begin human testing, we have no choice but to dopreliminary tests in mice. It’s worth noting that the mice used in our ADstudies do not appear to suffer; the cognitive decline caused by the mutationswe introduce is similar to what occurs in humans with AD who reach very old age.Thanks to these studies in mice, my group is now ready to start a clinical trialon the use of FMD in the prevention and treatment of AD together with a group ofclinical geriatricians and neurologists at the University of Genova. We havealready performed preliminary studies on the effects of the FMD on cognitiveperformance in normal participants and obtained positive and very promisingresults, which serve as a strong foundation for the Alzheimer studies. The pointof this section is not to review all mouse studies related to diet andAlzheimer’s. Rather, the goal is to lay the foundation for specific diets in theprevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.Our first study attempted to delay the onset of Alzheimer’s disease byregulating the genes that accelerate aging. We used “triple transgenic” mice,which have three of the mutated human genes associated with Alzheimer’s disease(APP, PS1, and tau). Because AD in the great majority of cases occurs after ageseventy, we opted against using a chronic low-calorie diet, since even if itproved effective, it could not be safely adopted by elderly people. We decidedto regulate the activity of the two major sets of genes accelerating aging bytricking the cells, giving the mice a normal diet that lacked the nine essentialamino acids (those the body cannot generate: isoleucine, leucine, lysine,methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, valine, and arginine). We alsogave the mice excess quantities of the nonessential amino acids, which the humanbody can make and therefore does not need to obtain from the diet. In otherwords, the test diet was identical to the normal diet but contained feweressential amino acids and more nonessential amino acids.Starting at young to middle age, the mice received this diet every other week,alternating with a normal diet. The potent effect of this minimal change isobvious from the 75 percent reduction we detected in the levels of the pro-agingand cancer growth factor IGF-1 in the mice while on the diet. Notably, theeffect of this dietary intervention on IGF-1 levels continued even after themice returned to their normal diet. Months later, the mice placed on theprotein-restricted diet every other week had better performance in severaldifferent cognitive tests, indicating that they were protected from Alzheimer’sdisease symptoms.These results are evidence of the potential of nutritechnology—that is,understanding the effect of food composition on specific genes and pathways inthe quest for therapeutic diets that are minimally disruptive yet have effectscomparable or superior to drug therapy. This is different from the concept of“nutraceuticals,” which in most cases are foods engineered for concentratedlevels of particular molecules that have specific biological or medicalfunctions. For example, concentrated vitamin C obtained from acerola can beconsidered a nutraceutical.image [../images/9781405933940_TheLongevityDiet_042_IMGX.jpg]10.1. Improvement of cognitive tests in mice exposed to fasting-mimicking dietcyclesIn a study I have already mentioned, mice received a reduced-calorie FMD forfour-day cycles twice a month (eight days a month total), starting in middleage. In old age, these mice learned and remembered much better than mice in thecontrol group (see fig. 10.1 [chapter010.xhtml#lon0000883s]). We observedperformance improvements in all tests, including motor coordination (on arotating wheel), and both long-term and short-term memory.The FMD cycles had profound effects on genes that play key roles in the agingprocess, including aging of the brain. Researchers at the US National Instituteon Aging have performed many studies in this area, focusing on alternate-dayfasting. Receiving no food one day and a normal diet the next day, these miceconsistently showed improvements in learning and memory function. The benefitsapplied to both normal mice and mice with Alzheimer’s disease.1[chapter010_notes.xhtml#ch10-1]We are now ready to begin clinical trials to test the effect of similar but lesscalorie-restricted diets in humans.DIETARY PREVENTION OF ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE IN HUMANSThe periodic FMD, because it promotes a longer and generally healthier lifespan,is recommended for most people, but because it provides a very low level ofcalories, it is not recommended for people over the age of seventy. What wouldbe the point of adopting a diet that prevents Alzheimer’s disease if the samediet promoted a deficiency in the immune system or made the patient frail? Thus,before a dietary intervention can be recommended, it is imperative that itspotential to prevent or treat a disease or condition outweighs its potential tocause adverse side effects. Thus, the minimal risks of using an FMD in asixty-five-year-old would be justified if this person was at high risk fordeveloping Alzheimer’s; this should be considered only until age seventy, orpossibly older depending on the ability to maintain a normal weight and musclemass, and based on the individual’s overall health status and the opinion of aneurologist. Notably, several studies indicate that a calorie-restricted dietimproves and prevents loss of muscle mass in older animals and therefore furtherstudies are needed to determine whether periodic FMDs would have positive ornegative effects on muscle mass and strength in the elderly. With theavailability of inexpensive and highly specific DNA testing, we can now alsoconsider diets tailored for the prevention of a specific disease in individuals.For example, the APOE protein, responsible for carrying cholesterol andcholesterol-like molecules, comes in three forms: APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4. Forpeople—particularly women—who have two copies of the APOE4 gene, the risk ofdeveloping Alzheimer’s disease is fifteen times higher than average. In thegeneral population, the chance of having AD after age eighty-five is more than40 percent; for someone with two copies (alleles) of the APOE4 gene, the riskshoots up to 91 percent—with half of them developing the disease by agesixty-eight.2 [chapter010_notes.xhtml#ch10-2] I encourage anyone whose parentsor grandparents had Alzheimer’s disease to pursue genetic testing to determineif they have risk factors for the disease. If the tests come back positive, theymay want to talk to their doctor about adopting the dietary recommendations thatfollow.THE LONGEVITY DIET PLUS EXCESS OLIVE OIL AND NUTSThe periodic FMD may be effective in cognitive disease prevention in mice andpossibly humans, but everyday diet also plays a central role in cognitivehealth. Although we are still conducting our studies into the positive effectsof the Longevity Diet on neurodegenerative diseases, an everyday diet that hasbeen shown to be protective against cognitive decline is the Mediterranean dietin combination with high levels of olive oil.3 [chapter010_notes.xhtml#ch10-3]A six-year study in Barcelona, Spain, originally designed as a cardiovascularstudy (and mentioned in the last chapter) monitored 447 volunteers (with a meanage of sixty-seven years) who were at high cardiovascular risk but cognitivelyhealthy. Participants were randomly assigned to a Mediterranean dietsupplemented with either extra virgin olive oil or 30 grams of nuts per day, ora control diet in which they were advised to reduce dietary fat. Participants onthe Mediterranean diet plus olive oil or nuts performed better in cognitivetesting than those on the low-fat control diet.4 [chapter010_notes.xhtml#ch10-4]In people over age sixty—and likely also in younger people—a Mediterranean dietsupplemented with either olive oil or nuts is associated with improved cognitivefunction. However, an analysis of many studies on the Mediterranean diet andneurodegenerative diseases concluded that adherence to the Mediterranean dietonly decreases the risk of neurodegenerative diseases by 13 percent.5[chapter010_notes.xhtml#ch10-5] Thus, in order to optimize brain health anddelay or prevent Alzheimer’s onset, I recommend the Longevity Diet plusadditional nutrients including olive oil and nuts, as described below. Thoughthe efficacy of this diet in the prevention of dementia has not beendemonstrated yet, it has a higher potential for significant impact since itrepresents a stricter version of the Mediterranean diet and includes manyadditional nutrients of reported benefit.COFFEE AND COCONUT OILThe role of coffee in health and longevity has been controversial. Althoughearlier studies included coffee as a risk factor for a variety of age-relateddiseases, including cancer and heart disease, later more careful studiesindicate that moderate coffee consumption may in fact protect against diseases,including Parkinson’s, type 2 diabetes, and liver disease. A few studies suggestthat coffee may also protect against Alzheimer’s.Researchers at the University of South Carolina reviewed studies publishedbetween 1966 and 2014 assessing the relationship between coffee consumption anddementias. They examined eleven studies of a total of 29,000 participants.Overall, coffee drinkers and non–coffee drinkers showed no difference in theirrisk of developing dementia. However, the group with the highest coffeeconsumption had an approximately 30 percent reduction in the risk of developingAlzheimer’s disease. It is possible that drinking three or four cups of coffee aday may protect against Alzheimer’s, as it was shown to protect againstParkinson’s.6 [chapter010_notes.xhtml#ch10-6] This may be caused in part bycoffee’s high polyphenol content. However, this type of coffee consumption couldcause side effects, and its use should be considered only if you are at highrisk for AD, and then under medical supervision.Coconut oil contains high levels of saturated fat. But unlike other dietarysaturated fats, which are composed mainly of long-chain fatty acids (fats with13 to 21 carbons in the chain), coconut oil contains a high level ofmedium-chain fatty acids (MCFA, or fats with 6 to 12 carbons in the chain). MCFAare easily converted into ketone bodies, the same molecules produced at highlevels during fasting. The brain begins to utilize ketones as a major source ofenergy during prolonged fasting periods and when glucose is scarce.In a study of patients with Alzheimer’s disease, consumption of 40 milliliters(1.5 fluid ounces) per day of extra virgin coconut oil resulted in animprovement in cognitive status. This finding is consistent with other studiessuggesting medium-chain fatty acids protect against dementia. While coconutoil’s protective role must be confirmed in large clinical studies, the publisheddata indicates it may improve cognition in Alzheimer’s disease patients.7[chapter010_notes.xhtml#ch10-7] Notably, the American Heart Association includescoconut oil among the potentially harmful foods containing saturated fats.Whether this concern is appropriate is hotly debated, but the possibility thatregular use of coconut oil could increase cardiovascular disease should beconsidered when using it to prevent or treat dementias.“BAD” FATS AND ALZHEIMER’S DISEASEWhile the medium-length fats in coconut oil and the mono-unsaturated fats inolive oil may protect against Alzheimer’s disease, the opposite is true ofsaturated and other fats, the “bad” fats, which may increase the risk ofdeveloping dementia in addition to cardiovascular disease. Several studiesindicate that consuming high levels of saturated or trans fatty acids increasesthe risk of dementia. In studies conducted at the Chicago Health and AgingProject, consumption of saturated and trans fatty acids was associated with anincreased risk of AD.8 [chapter010_notes.xhtml#ch10-8] These findings supportadoption of the Longevity Diet, which is nearly free of the saturated fats andtrans fats found in high quantities in animal-derived foods (especially redmeat, butter, cheese, whole milk, pork, and candy).9[chapter010_notes.xhtml#ch10-9]SUFFICIENT NOURISHMENTCertain vitamins and other nutrients have been proposed to beneuroprotective—that is, capable of protecting neurons against damage. This viewis probably simplistic, but some studies have implicated deficiencies in omega-3fatty acids, B vitamins, and vitamins C, D, and E in brain aging and dementias.To date, most have failed to show a clear association between high-dosesupplementation of these vitamins and nutrients and protection againstdementias.That said, every diet should contain a sufficient level of foods rich in allthese nutrients (see appendix B [appendix002.xhtml] for foods containing thehighest levels of these nutrients). In fact, a review of studies indicates thatAD patients have lower levels of folate and vitamins A, B12, C, and E. It wouldnot be surprising if, in the future, certain deficiencies were found tocontribute to AD. So while supplementing with high levels of vitamins or fattyacids may not be proven as protective, it avoids the risk of developing adeficiency, which could accelerate brain degeneration and dementias. Foods richin vitamins may reduce the risk of AD but, for example, B vitaminsupplementation was found to be largely ineffective, except in countries wherefood is not fortified with the folate vitamin.10[chapter010_notes.xhtml#ch10-10]AGE-APPROPRIATE WEIGHT AND ABDOMINAL CIRCUMFERENCEThe association between body mass index (which takes into account a person’sweight relative to height) and cognition is complex and varies according to age.In younger and middle-age adults, a high BMI is associated with reducedcognition or a higher risk of dementia once these adults reach old age. However,a slightly higher BMI in older adults is associated with improved cognition andlower mortality. Thus, it is important to maintain a healthy weight and idealabdominal circumference up to age sixty-five; beyond that point, the goal shouldbe to reach the upper limit of the healthy BMI and abdominal circumferenceranges. For men, a BMI in the 22 to 23 range may be ideal up to age sixty-fiveto seventy-five, but beyond that age, a BMI in the 23 to 25 range may bepreferable in order to avoid loss of muscle mass and other detrimentaldeficiencies.This goal could be achieved by adding small amounts of foods not permitted orvery restricted under the Longevity Diet, such as eggs, goat’s or sheep’s cheeseand yogurt, dark chocolate, fruit, and higher levels of fish and seafood. Thesefoods should be consumed only in moderation even at older ages. Adding them tothe Longevity Diet may help prevent weight loss and muscle loss, especially whenprotein consumption (0.4 grams of protein per pound of body weight) is combinedwith muscle training and exercise (see chapter 5 [chapter005.xhtml]).11[chapter010_notes.xhtml#ch10-11]DIETARY TREATMENT OF ALZHEIMER’S DISEASEDietary interventions to prevent dementias—including coconut oil, olive oil, andthe Longevity Diet—may also help patients with Alzheimer’s disease or acondition called mild cognitive impairment, which often precedes dementia.Unlike their role in treating cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease,however, the role of dietary interventions in the treatment of Alzheimer’sdisease and other dementias is little understood and still speculative. BecauseAD is devastating to patients and their families, and because most AD patientscannot afford to wait for future studies, I will describe the mouse studies wehave completed and the studies we are about to perform in AD patients, which Ibelieve have potential.Again, the purpose of these interventions isn’t necessarily to cure AD but totry to delay its onset by five or ten years or more. Only a neurologistspecialized in AD can determine whether any individual patient should try thediet. It must be understood that this is an unproven and risky strategy, whichneeds clinical testing in large trials before its safety and efficacy can beestablished. It would be best to try the following recommendations as part of anapproved clinical trial.As I mentioned, we had positive results in a mouse study alternating weeklongcycles of a protein-free diet supplemented with nonessential amino acids andweeklong cycles of a normal high-protein diet. With the input of an experiencedneurologist, AD patients could try weekly cycles of a low-protein diet (0.1 to0.15 grams of protein per pound of body weight) alternating with a relativelyhigh-protein diet (0.45 grams of protein per pound of body weight). The patientwould eat a diet based on carbohydrates and “good” fats (no meat, fish, eggs,milk, or cheese and low levels of legumes) for one week, followed by a normaland high-nourishment Longevity Diet the next week. The diet should include dailysupplements of coconut oil (40 milliliters). During the “nourishment week,”salmon and other fish high in omega-3 oils (see appendix B [appendix002.xhtml])should be eaten at least three times a week, with care taken to avoidhigh-mercury fish.Continue these week-on, week-off cycles of very low protein and normal proteinfor at least six months to see if (1) cognitive performance improves and (2) thepatient maintains normal weight and muscle mass and does not develop othersymptoms. If the patient loses more than 5 percent of body weight or musclemass, further cycles of the diet should be delayed until the patient returns toa healthy weight.Another admittedly risky option is to use the monthly FMD, which we have testedin people ages twenty to seventy but not in older subjects or in AD patients(see chapter 6 [chapter006.xhtml]). In a small and preliminary study, weobserved improvements in cognitive performance in subjects who received threecycles of the monthly FMD. This is consistent with the strong effects of thetwice-a-month FMD started in middle age on neural regeneration and the improvedcognitive performance in mice once they reach old age.12[chapter010_notes.xhtml#ch10-12]Note that FMD is potentially very risky in elderly subjects, especially thosewho are frail, are low-weight, or have lost weight during the progression of thedisease. In the periods between FMD cycles, patients should follow ahigh-nourishment, plant-and fish-based diet that’s relatively high in protein(0.45 gram of protein per pound of body weight).I emphasize once more that these interventions should be considered only in theabsence of other viable options and based on the recommendation of a specializedneurologist, with the precautions and warnings listed above and preferably aspart of a clinical trial.EXERCISE BOTH BODY AND MINDRemaining both physically and mentally active has been shown to protect againstage-related dementias. A review of all the studies on exercise and dementia,covering eight hundred patients and eighteen randomized clinical trials,concluded that physical activity—particularly aerobic exercise, such as runningand swimming—improves cognitive function in patients with dementia (see theexercise guidelines in chapter 5 [chapter005.xhtml]).13[chapter010_notes.xhtml#ch10-13]Exercise is important in both the prevention and treatment of dementias.Naturally, for frail and older patients, a stationary bicycle may be moreappropriate than running or swimming. Pedal resistance can be adjusted toachieve the right level of difficulty to challenge but avoid physical harm tothe patient.Another way to ward off AD and other dementias is to maintain brain activity.Reading, solving puzzles, and playing computer games have all been shown toimprove cognition and help prevent or delay dementias.14[chapter010_notes.xhtml#ch10-14]SUMMARY: PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASESPREVENTIONThe following are guidelines for people at high risk of developing dementias(given family history or early cognitive decline): 1. Adopt the Longevity Diet and the periodic FMD. 2. Incorporate plenty of olive oil (50 milliliters per day) and nuts (30 grams per day). 3. Drink coffee. For people at relatively low risk of AD, keep it to one or two cups a day; for people at high risk, drink up to three or four cups a day. Speak to your doctor if you have problems. 4. Take 40 milliliters of coconut oil per day but consider potential heart disease risk (people with or at risk for cardiovascular disease should not use coconut oil). 5. Avoid saturated fats and trans fats. 6. Avoid all animal-based products with the exception of low-mercury fish and cheese or other dairy products from goat’s milk. 7. Follow a high-nourishment diet containing omega-3, B vitamins, and vitamins C, D, and E. 8. Take a multivitamin and mineral every day.TREATMENTThe following are guidelines for people who have already been diagnosed with ADor dementia. This treatment plan must be approved and supervised by aneurologist and should be combined with standard of care. 1. Follow all the dementia-prevention dietary recommendations above. 2. Talk to your neurologist about following cycles of a protein- and essential amino acid–deficient diet followed by normal calorie intake and/or cycles of the periodic FMD. With AD and other diseases that are later in onset, it’s important to remember that calorie- and nutrient-restricted diets are potentially dangerous to the elderly, so the neurologist on the case should work with a registered dietitian to optimize the effects on brain function while minimizing risks and side effects. Although our studies into AD are perhaps the most speculative, this is an area I feel especially passionate about. By acting on the aging process using strategies like the Longevity Diet, it is possible to delay and even prevent diseases and remain as healthy as Emma Morano or Salvatore Caruso, who remembered well not only what they had done an hour earlier but also remembered many stories and even songs from their youth. This is my ambitious vision, and we’re working with labs and researchers around the world to help make it possible."},{"pageContent":"Penguin walking logo [../images/PCHI_1.gif]CHAPTER 11FMD AND NUTRITION IN THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF INFLAMMATORY AND AUTOIMMUNEDISEASESFN1 [footnotes.xhtml#fn-10]> [For their review of this chapter, I thank Kurt Hong, MD, PhD, associate> professor and director of the USC Center for Clinical Nutrition, Los Angeles,> and Andreas Michalsen, head physician, at the Experimental and Clinical> Research Center, Charité–University Medicine Berlin.]AGING AND THE AUTOIMMUNE SYSTEMAs we age, we suffer damage to, or malfunction of, the cells of our immunesystem. White blood cells central to the immune system—including T cells,macrophages, and neutrophils—naturally produce inflammatory factors. Thesenormally play a central role in coordinating many different healthy immunefunctions, ranging from combatting and killing bacteria and viruses to killingand disposing of damaged human cells, including cancer cells.But as we get older, and also in association with disease, production of bothimmune cells and these inflammatory factors can become dysregulated. When thishappens, inflammation can be activated even when it is not needed. This canresult in a low-level systemic inflammation involving the entire body. In somecases, this inflammation is followed by the development of a strong immunityagainst normal cells or molecules within cells, resulting in a self-recognition,in which the immune system attacks parts of its own body—this is what occurs inautoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Crohn’s, and type 1 diabetes.One way to determine whether someone has systemic inflammation—considered a riskfactor for cancer and cardiovascular diseases, among other conditions—is tomeasure the level of C-reactive protein in the blood. The liver naturallyproduces CRP in response to systemic inflammation. Research shows that about athird of US adults have systemic inflammation as measured by CRP,1[chapter011_notes.xhtml#ch11-1] but large portions of European and otherpopulations are also affected—a consequence of normal aging and unhealthybehaviors, such as consumption of Western diets, obesity, and exposure toinfection. Because the Mediterranean diet has been associated with a reducedrisk of disease, many Europeans believe they are protected by their diet.Unfortunately, as I have shown in previous chapters, even the strictest form ofthe Mediterranean diet has a limited beneficial effect on aging and disease. Andbecause most Europeans do not know what the Mediterranean diet entails, and alsobecause adherence to the strictest form is difficult, it is seldom adopted evenin the Mediterranean region.A recent worldwide analysis revealed that between 8 and 9 percent of the globalpopulation has been diagnosed with one of the major twenty-nine autoimmunediseases2 [chapter011_notes.xhtml#ch11-2]—the most common being type 1 diabetes,multiple sclerosis, Crohn’s disease, polymyalgia, psoriasis, lupus, andrheumatoid arthritis.Alarmingly, the number of newly diagnosed cases of autoimmune diseases has beenon the rise for the past thirty years. In the last decade, the incidence hasjumped worldwide by a remarkable 19 percent a year.3[chapter011_notes.xhtml#ch11-3] In other words, autoimmune diseases appear to bedoubling in number every five years. While some of this increase can beattributed to improved diagnosis and awareness of certain conditions, it’slikely that environmental and dietary factors are also to blame.NUTRITION AND AUTOIMMUNE DISEASESObesity has been linked to multiple autoimmune diseases, including multiplesclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. It may also be linked to Crohn’s and otherautoimmune diseases of the gut.4 [chapter011_notes.xhtml#ch11-4] Because fatcells can be an important source of inflammatory molecules like TNF alpha andIL-6, the connection between obesity and autoimmune disorders could be relatedto abdominal fat. Fat accumulated in the abdomen and elsewhere in the body cangenerate molecules that stimulate immune responses, prompting immune cells toturn against other ordinary body cells.High salt consumption is also believed to contribute to autoimmune diseases,possibly by promoting the activation of T cells—a central culprit in manyautoimmune diseases. More studies are needed to confirm and understand the roleof sodium in autoimmune disorders, but because salt is also involved incardiovascular disease, moderation is generally recommended for those diagnosedwith or at high risk for autoimmune diseases.Diet can also affect the immune system by altering the bacteria population inthe gut, which in turn regulates many different immune cells. It’s wellestablished that the Western diet can have inflammatory, negative effects on thetypes of microbiota occupying the human gut.5 [chapter011_notes.xhtml#ch11-5]Research shows the bacterial population present in the gut of people eating ananimal-based Western diet can be rapidly altered to a less inflammatorypopulation simply by switching to a plant-based diet.6[chapter011_notes.xhtml#ch11-6]AT THE TABLE WITH YOUR ANCESTORSA less-understood potential factor explaining the rapid worldwide increase inautoimmune diseases may involve expanding choices in a modern, globalized foodsupply. My laboratory is only beginning to investigate this aspect of autoimmunediseases. We suspect, however, that certain aspects of today’s globalized dietmay trigger autoimmune responses. For example, in a study, cow’s milkconsumption in children was associated with elevated autoimmunity against thepancreatic cells that generate insulin, resulting in an increased risk for type1 diabetes.7 [chapter011_notes.xhtml#ch11-7] Eventually, it will be possible toconnect a person’s DNA (the genome) to the food he or she should avoid eating toprevent autoimmune disorders or intolerances. For now, my best advice is to “eatat the table of your ancestors.”This means finding out where your parents, grandparents, and great-grandparentscame from and what foods were common in those places. My ancestors are all fromItaly, and because of this my diet is rich in tomatoes, green beans, garbanzobeans, and olive oil. Tomatoes are known to activate an immune response in asmall minority of people, and they arrived in Italy only four hundred years ago,but that’s long enough that there is minimal risk that they will causewidespread autoimmunities or intolerances in today’s Italians. In contrast, agrandchild of Japanese or southern Italians, both populations without milk intheir traditional historical adult diet, is likely to develop lactoseintolerance as an adult.If my grandparents were from Okinawa, I would include sweet potatoes andseaweeds in my diet; if they were from Germany, cabbage and asparagus. It seemscomplicated, but it’s not. It may require you to sit down with your parents orgrandparents and ask questions, or ask an old person who used to live in thesame area as your grandparents. Try to get the full list, since every componentof their diet was probably selected to make up a full nourishment diet. Eventhough a little village like that of my parents in southern Italy did notconduct scientific studies to determine what diet was good or bad, everyone kneweveryone else, and if someone developed vitamin B12 deficiency because theynever ate fish or meat or eggs, everyone else in town would hear about it, andeventually learn how to avoid vitamin B12 deficiency. Similarly, if many babieswho drank cow’s milk developed problems, people would eventually notice andswitch their babies to goat’s milk. This type of food selection can happen moreeasily in villages and small towns, but it can also occur in cities if peoplelive their whole lives in the same place. It would be much less likely to happenin the United States or in large cities like London or Tokyo, where communitiesare more transient and people know less about their neighbors’ diseases and foodhabits.We do not yet have solid evidence that “eating at the table of your ancestors”will prevent diseases and make you live longer. And I’m not proposing that youeat exactly what your grandparents ate, rather that you match what they ate withthe Longevity Diet described in this book.When you don’t have the luxury of waiting until conclusive scientific andclinical studies are completed, it makes sense to adopt the best possiblehypothesis using all the available information. In this case, the hypothesis isthat a town of two thousand people and the surrounding towns—together with thedoctors working in these towns—will be able to detect many of the advantages anddisadvantages associated with particular foods by observing their effect overdecades and by learning from their parents and grandparents. Much of theinformation will end up being correct. Some of it will be incorrect, but therisk of adopting this strategy is virtually zero—the food that was common andsafe at the table of your ancestors is very unlikely to be harmful to you.It’s also important to know what your ancestors didn’t eat. While the market maynow be rich with so-called health foods and superfoods—ranging from kale tocurcumin, quinoa to chia seeds—that can provide high levels of vitamins orprotein, these varied ingredients and foods may be more harmful than helpful topeople whose ancestors never consumed them. Quinoa, which originally comes fromthe Peruvian Andes, may be perfectly safe for people whose ancestors used it asa staple ingredient in their diet. It may also be fine for the great majority ofpeople around the world. But it may lead to allergies, intolerances, and evenautoimmune diseases in a small group of people—particularly those exposed toother factors contributing to autoimmune diseases. For example, quinoa was shownto increase the immune response in mice, which may be evidence of its potentialto cause autoimmune diseases in humans,8 [chapter011_notes.xhtml#ch11-8] and itwas shown to cause severe allergic reactions in multiple patients in the UnitedStates and France.9 [chapter011_notes.xhtml#ch11-9] Thus, if all your ancestorsgoing back three hundred years lived in Germany, for example, it may be best toavoid “health foods” like quinoa and turmeric (curcumin), that historically werenot key ingredients of the German diet.AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE TREATMENTThe above-listed guidelines for the prevention of autoimmune diseases shouldalso be adopted by patients undergoing disease treatment. In the followingsection, I focus on the use of FMD for the treatment of multiple sclerosis andrheumatoid arthritis—autoimmune diseases my group and others have investigatedboth in mouse studies and human clinical trials.We have now tested the FMD with two additional major autoimmune diseases inmice. In both cases it worked surprisingly well, suggesting that FMD has thepotential to reduce the severity of many autoimmune diseases. Please considerthat these interventions are still under clinical or laboratory investigationand that, until larger clinical trials are completed, we cannot know whetherthey are effective in humans, nor can we exclude the possibility of severe sideeffects in a minority of patients.MULTIPLE SCLEROSISMultiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder in which immune cells (Tcells) attack the insulating sheath around nerve fibers in the central nervoussystem. The clinical presentation includes debility of one or more limbs,partial or total loss of unilateral vision, and generalized pain. Patientsgenerally suffer relapses of symptoms, which can be short but periodic. In somepatients, the associated symptoms progress. Our research related to FMD andautoimmune diseases started after we discovered that fasting causes a major dropin the number of circulating white blood cells in mice, followed by a return tonormal levels after they resume a normal diet (figure 11.1[chapter011.xhtml#lon0000972s]).10 [chapter011_notes.xhtml#ch11-10]image [../images/9781405933940_TheLongevityDiet_043_IMGX.jpg]11.1. Fasting cycles regenerates immune cells after chemotherapyIn the same study, we showed that during fasting, long-term hematopoietic stemcells are turned on and expanded. This type of stem cell, found in the blood, iscapable of generating the various cells of the immune system. Two researchquestions followed this finding: 1. Does the fasting preferentially kill dysfunctional cells, including autoimmune cells? 2. When animals or humans return to their normal diet after fasting, will the stem cells generate only healthy immune cells or will the new cells also become autoimmune?After we published our findings, I started receiving emails from people who,having read media accounts of our study, had attempted fasting to fight theirautoimmune disorders. Several reported to me that four or five days of FMD hadreduced and in some cases even cured their autoimmune diseases.The results of our first set of tests in mice were remarkable. To replaceautoimmune cells with good ones, we hypothesized, we had to first kill off thebad ones. It worked. Cycles of the FMD not only reduced the severity of themultiple sclerosis in all mice; it eliminated all symptoms in a portion of themice that had already developed the disease. Each cycle of the FMD killed aportion of the autoimmune cells, and three cycles eliminated disease symptoms in20 percent of the mice. FMD worked in another remarkable way: it promotedregeneration of the damaged myelin in the mouse spinal cord.image [../images/9781405933940_TheLongevityDiet_044_IMGX.jpg]11.2. Rejuvenation from withinThus, FMD cycles reversed the autoimmunity in a subset of mice by (1) killingoff bad immune cells, (2) generating new and healthy ones, and (3) turning onprogenitor cells (cells similar to stem cells), which can regenerate damagednerves. This is an example of what I call “rejuvenation from within.” FMD killsmany cells, but it is particularly effective in killing off old and damagedimmune cells that have lost the ability to distinguish between the cells of itsown body and invading organisms such as bacteria and viruses. Fasting increasesstem cells but reduces immune cells. After re-feeding, stem cells generate newand healthy immune cells (fig. 11.2 [chapter011.xhtml#lon0000979s]).In mice, FMD could do even more: it seemed to prompt the body to detect damagein the spinal cord—like it detects damage to the skin after a cut—and turn onstem and progenitor cells to repair the damage. Could the FMD actually curemultiple sclerosis in human patients?In collaboration with other researchers, we performed a randomized clinicaltrial on patients with multiple sclerosis (relapsing-remitting) to determinejust this.11 [chapter011_notes.xhtml#ch11-11] Twenty MS patients were asked toundergo a single seven-day cycle of an FMD, followed by a Mediterranean diet forsix months. The choice of the Mediterranean diet instead of the Longevity Dietwas made by our clinical collaborators at Charité–University Medicine Berlin. Inour future MS studies, we anticipate combining the periodic FMD with theeveryday Longevity Diet. A control group of twenty MS patients continued theirnormal diet.The FMD began with a pre-fasting day of 800 calories from fruit, rice, and/orpotatoes. This was followed by seven fasting days, during which patientsconsumed 200 to 350 calories a day from vegetable broths or vegetable juice,supplemented with linseed oil (omega-3) three times daily. Patients were advisedto drink 2 to 3 liters of unsweetened fluids each day (water and herbal teas).After the seven-day FMD period, solid foods were reintroduced slowly for threedays. Patients followed a plant-based Mediterranean diet for the next six months(see chapter 4 [chapter004.xhtml]). An additional twenty MS patients were placedon a “ketogenic diet” (very high levels of fat, normal protein, and lowcarbohydrates) for six months; a ketogenic diet had previously shown improvedoutcomes for MS patients.After the study ended, patients who had received a single cycle of FMD reportedsignificant improvements in quality of life, physical health, and mental health.Side effects unrelated to MS were similar in both groups and were reported byapproximately 20 percent of patients on the regular diet and those receiving theFMD. The most common side effects were respiratory tract infections and urinarytract infections, but there was no indication of liver or other damage. Ninetypercent of the patients in the FMD group were able to complete the trial period.During the six-month study period, four relapses were observed in the controlgroup, and three relapses were observed in the FMD group.Overall, this study indicates that FMD is safe and potentially effective in MSpatients, although additional and larger studies are necessary to confirm theseresults. Notably, whereas mice received multiple cycles of FMD, human subjectsreceived only one seven-day cycle, which raises the possibility that efficacywould increase once multiple cycles are tested in human MS patients, followed bythe Longevity Diet. We are now preparing to perform several larger clinicaltrials with hundreds of MS patients exposed to multiple cycles of FMD.CROHN’S DISEASE AND COLITISAfter we published our work on fasting and immunity, journalist and autoimmunedisease sufferer Jenni Russell of the Times of London wrote several articlesabout it. I include one of these articles below. At the time, it was too earlyto tell journalists about our work on multiple sclerosis and other autoimmunedisorders, but we were already convinced the results were promising.FASTING TRANSFORMED ME AFTER MEDICINE FAILEDBY JENNI RUSSELLTIMES OF LONDON | APRIL 22, 2015In the last ten months, my life has been transformed. I didn’t write a book,move house, have children, find a faith, or change my job. Instead, I have gonefrom being an exhausted person with a lifelong and incurable illness, kept aliveby four drugs, to a currently healthy and energetic one. This remarkabledifference has been brought about by a therapy that’s simple, free andoverlooked by the NHS: fasting.I tried fasting because I was desperate. It’s two decades since I developed aserious autoimmune condition which has often left me sleeping 12 hours a day andsometimes kept me in bed for months at a time. It was made worse by chemotherapyfor cancer five years ago. I was told after that I could never live withoutimmune-suppressing drugs; when I tried to, I was rushed to hospital as anemergency admission and spent several days on drips.That was when I came across research from the University of Southern California.Valter Longo, a leading biogerontologist who had been studying the effects offasting on mice for 20 years, had discovered that if mice were starved for threedays, their immune systems started to regenerate. Starvation forced the bonemarrow to create stem cells, replacing the faulty immune response with a normalone. Intermittent fasts over six months created steady improvement. This therapymight, said Longo, prove remarkably effective for anyone with an autoimmunecondition or whose immune system was deteriorating with age. He cautioned thatnothing was proven until human trials had been done.I had nothing to lose by trying it, except my temper and a little weight. Istarted the first fast on a boat journey on a stormy sea. It was made a loteasier by the fact that I’d lost my appetite anyway, and that I wasn’t requiredto do anything except lie in a bunk and read. Still, it was very boring to havenothing to look forward to but hot water, cold water, fizzy water; black tea,green tea, mint tea. I got fiercely hungry, and sometimes dizzy, but thesensation would pass. I lasted two and a half days and thought nothing couldcome of it. On the fourth day, I woke feeling better than I had for years.Since then I have fasted three more times, most recently for four days. It’s nofun. I couldn’t do it while working, or cooking for anyone else. You need to befree to crash out whenever your indignant body complains. You also needdistractions to look forward to when you remember, gloomily, that there isn’t ameal ahead; books, films, the company of partners and friends.I only do it because the results have been so dramatic. I am off every drug, andfor the first time since getting ill I don’t have to ration my energy and time.I can’t know if it will last, but I have become a quiet evangelist. Fasting, asone doctor said recently, may be the panacea that western medicine forgot.In the last few years diabetes researchers have found that the disease can becured by a daily 600-calorie diet for eight weeks. Longo’s own earlier researchindicates that fasting is as effective as chemotherapy in treating cancer.Combining the two, fasting just before and after treatment, increases theefficacy of chemo by up to 40 per cent while minimizing side-effects. Cancercells cope badly with being simultaneously poisoned and starved. But normalcells gain protection, because fasting closes the pathways that let toxins in.Since a fifth of all cancer-related deaths are due to the effects of chemo, thismay be a major breakthrough.We have now carried out mouse studies on Crohn’s disease. The results are notyet published, but I can confirm they are very promising. Patients sufferingfrom Crohn’s, colitis, or another gastrointestinal inflammatory disease shouldtalk to their doctors about using an FMD in support of standard-of-care therapy.If the neurologist agrees, follow the FMD protocol in our multiple sclerosisarticle12 [chapter011_notes.xhtml#ch11-12] once every two months until eitherthe symptoms improve or it becomes clear that the diet does not help. It is bestif this is done as part of a clinical trial.RHEUMATOID ARTHRITISRheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease resulting inthe destruction of multiple joints. It affects about 1 percent of the overallpopulation and 2 percent of people over the age of sixty. Fasting or verylow-calorie diets lasting one to three weeks have been shown to be effective inthe treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, or RA. Inflammation and pain typical ofRA can improve within a few days of commencing the fast,13[chapter011_notes.xhtml#ch11-13] but they return after patients resume theirnormal diet. If the fasting period is followed by a vegetarian diet, some of thetherapeutic effects remain.14 [chapter011_notes.xhtml#ch11-14] This combinationtherapy has produced beneficial results lasting years.15[chapter011_notes.xhtml#ch11-15] The efficacy of this approach has beenconfirmed by four different studies, including two randomized clinical trials.16[chapter011_notes.xhtml#ch11-16] For many patients able to endure long-termfasting and willing to permanently modify their diet, fasting cycles have thepotential to not only augment but also replace existing medical treatments.17[chapter011_notes.xhtml#ch11-17]What has yet to be tried is multiple/periodic cycles of the periodic FMD everyone to three months in the treatment of RA instead of a single cycle followed bymajor changes in the diet. Our research on multiple sclerosis, Crohn’s, andseveral other autoimmune diseases—combined with our clinical results suggestingthat FMD reduces systemic inflammation in the great majority of patients withhigh inflammation (CRP) at the beginning of the trial—suggests that the idealway to treat RA will be with cycles of the five-day FMD (see chapter 6[chapter006.xhtml]) every one to three months. Between cycles, I recommend theLongevity Diet described in chapter 4 [chapter004.xhtml]. We have evidence thatmonthly cycles of FMD could benefit RA patients even in the absence of switchingto a Mediterranean or Longevity Diet. While this is not my recommendation, forthose who cannot permanently change their diet, the monthly five days of FMD maybe a good option. Notably, FMD would have the advantage of providing relativelyhigh calories, which would allow patients to do this under medical supervisionbut without checking into a clinic. Considering that in our pilot multiplesclerosis trial a weeklong FMD was safe and potentially effective in improvingpatients’ quality of life, and considering past studies on RA, a periodicseven-day FMD may be more effective than a shorter one. After future studies, wewill know more about the efficacy of FMD against various autoimmune disorders.We will also know more about the length and frequency of the diet best suited totreating these diseases.SUMMARY: PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF AUTOIMMUNE DISEASESPREVENTION 1. Follow the Longevity Diet, making sure you do so in such a way that you maintain a healthy weight and low abdominal circumference. 2. Avoid a high-salt diet. 3. Eat foods your ancestors ate frequently, and avoid foods that were not part of their diet.TREATMENT 1. Adopt all changes in the “Prevention” section above. 2. With your doctor’s approval and close supervision, and preferably as part of a clinical trial, alternate the Longevity Diet with a monthly five-day FMD, or the seven-day FMD described above every two months."},{"pageContent":"Penguin walking logo [../images/PCHI_1.gif]CHAPTER 12HOW TO STAY YOUNGI’ve postponed writing this book for years out of concern that myrecommendations, while optimizing healthy longevity, would cause side effects.Before I could put this down on paper, I needed to determine how nutrients arelinked to genes and molecules in cells, mice, and people, and to understandwhether and how the body can fix and rejuvenate itself. I had to test my theoryon myself and in randomized clinical trials. I also followed thousands ofpatients with cancer, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and other diseases andconditions as part of clinical trials or often directly by working with them orwith their physicians. I performed parallel studies of human populations withspecific genetic mutations, such as the Laron’s community in Ecuador, andconsumed specific diets, such as the centenarians in Calabria and Okinawa.Finally, I performed epidemiological studies of large US populations tounderstand the association between the consumption of certain foods and disease.I am grateful to the extraordinary students and research scientists in mylaboratories in Los Angeles and Milan who have given their all for years,allowing me to test and prove my hypotheses. I am also grateful to mycollaborators from all parts of the globe and across many fields of study. Inthe thirty years that I have worked on aging, the motivation driving me forwardwas the desire to discover the genes and molecular mechanisms that regulateaging and a healthy lifespan with the final goal to help people who have run outof therapeutic options. Not long ago I visited a famous journalist in the endstages of cancer. His oncologists had shrugged and sent him home.“There’s nothing more we can do,” they told him.Although I understand why his doctors were reluctant to try out my ideas—he hadlost so much weight by the time I met him—I actually believe there is almostalways something that can be done. Unfortunately, the system is not always setup to allow this. Sadly, I wasn’t able to intervene in his case, and he hassince passed away. I don’t know what would have happened to the Air Francepilot, the judge in Los Angeles, or the Times journalist if they had not triedfasting-based diets, but I suspect they would not have done as well as they did.At the same time, there is an official and appropriate process of identifyingmedical interventions (large randomized trials, FDA approval, etc.), that is asimportant as trying new and creative interventions and which cannot be ignored.Thus, when there are no viable options, it is important to adopt a therapeuticcompromise that is respectful of the official methods but which carefullyconsiders integrative therapies based on sufficient scientific and safety data.I am confident, thanks to evidence from the Five Pillars, that our FMD and othernutritional and integrative approaches will continue to help people remainhealthy and/or become healthier by acting on the ability of the body toregenerate and rejuvenate itself. I also hope our longevity studies, and otherscoming out of my colleagues’ labs, will bring swift implementation by medicaldoctors and dietitians who are in a position to act on new, proven, low-costintegrative treatments.My favorite novel is Luigi Pirandello’s One, None and One Hundred Thousand. Thebook’s premise is marvelously simple: If no one knows you, in some way, youdon’t exist; but if one hundred thousand people know you, there are one hundredthousand versions of you living in their heads. I see our work in the same way.If we make a discovery that helps no one, then in a way we haven’t discoveredanything at all. But if our discovery helps a hundred thousand people livelonger and healthier, then our discoveries live in the people who are alive orhealthier because of them.So I hope that this book will sell as well in the rest of the world as it hassold in Italy, not only because I hope that it will help many people reach oldage in good health, but also because 100 percent of my royalties from the salewill be donated to support our continued multidisciplinary studies.Below, I briefly summarize the most important findings and conclusions of ourresearch.THE LONGEVITY DIET 1. Eat a mostly vegan diet with some fish: Strive for a 100 percent plant- and fish-based diet, but limit fish consumption to two or three meals a week and avoid fish with high mercury content. After age sixty-five to seventy, if you start losing muscle mass, strength, and weight, add more fish and fruit and introduce animal-based foods like eggs, cheese, and yogurt made from sheep’s or goat’s milk. 2. Consume low but sufficient proteins: Consume approximately 0.31 to 0.36 grams of protein per pound of body weight per day. If you weigh 100 pounds, that is about 31 to 36 grams of protein per day, of which 30 grams should be consumed in a single meal to maximize muscle synthesis. If you weigh 200 pounds and have 35 percent body fat, 60 grams of protein per day are instead sufficient, considering that it is the lean body mass that utilizes most of the proteins. Protein intake should be raised slightly after age sixty-five to seventy in individuals who are losing weight and muscle. 3. Minimize bad fats and sugars, and maximize good fats and complex carbs: The diet should be rich in “good” unsaturated fats, including those from salmon, almonds, and walnuts, but very poor in “bad” saturated, hydrogenated, and trans fats. Likewise, the diet should be rich in complex carbohydrates, such as those provided by whole bread and vegetables, but poor in sugars and limited in pasta, rice, white bread, fruit juices, and fruits containing carbohydrates that are easily converted into simple sugars. Finally, the diet should be low in animal proteins but relatively high in vegetable proteins, in order to minimize the former’s negative effects on diseases and maximize the latter’s nourishing effects. 4. Be nourished: The body needs protein, essential fatty acids (omega-3 and omega-6), minerals, vitamins, and sufficient sugar to fight the many wars going on inside and outside cells. To be sure you get enough nutrients, every three days take a multivitamin and a mineral pill, plus an omega-3 fish oil soft gel purchased from a reputable manufacturer. 5. Eat at the table of your ancestors: Consume a variety of foods to take in all the required nutrients, but choose the ones that were common on the table of your parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents, so long as they are included in the Longevity Diet. 6. Eat twice a day plus a snack: Unless your waist circumference and body weight are in the normal or low range, it is best to eat breakfast plus one other meal a day and one low-calorie, low-sugar, nourishing snack. If your weight or muscle mass is too low, then eat three meals a day plus a snack. 7. Time-restricted eating: Restrict your eating to eleven to twelve hours or less per day. For example, if you eat breakfast after 8 a.m., finish dinner before 8 p.m. Shorter periods of feeding (ten hours or less) have been shown to be even more effective in promoting health, but they are much more difficult to comply with and may increase the risk of side effects, such as the formation of gallstones. 8. Periodic prolonged fasting-mimicking diets: People who are under seventy years of age, not frail or malnourished, and free of certain diseases should undergo five-day periods during which they consume a relatively high-calorie fasting-mimicking diet (see chapter 6 [chapter006.xhtml]). An FMD may also be appropriate for older people, but only if needed and if a medical doctor recommends it. 9. Follow steps 1 through 8 in such a way that you reach and maintain a waist circumference of less than 35.5 inches for men and less than 29.5 inches for women. This is higher than the ideal 33 inches and 27 inches cited earlier, but it is more realistic and should still be very effective in reducing disease risk while avoiding malnourishment.EXERCISE FOR LONGEVITYWalk fast one hour per day. Take the stairs instead of escalators and elevators,even if you have to go up many flights. On the weekend, try to walk, even tofaraway places, but avoid polluted areas. Do moderate exercise for 2.5 hours aweek, some of it in the vigorous range. Do weight training or weight-freeexercises to strengthen muscles (combined with 30 grams of protein intakefollowing the weight training).A LONG-LIVED MINDI have written very little in this book about the mind. I am not an expert inthis area, and I find that studies investigating how the mind can help us livelonger and healthier are few and inconclusive. Although there are many studieson social aspects of longevity, it would be difficult to find a set ofconsistent basic, clinical, epidemiological, and centenarian studies supportinga major role for a particular social behavior in healthy longevity. In theabsence of strong scientific data, I surmise that staying close to familymembers and friends, belonging to religious or spiritual organizations, andvolunteering to help others are all important to a long and healthy life.However, I have also seen many lonely people live long and healthy lives,probably because they focus on simple pleasures and obtain strength from theirown instincts and ability to find happiness in little things—eating certainfoods, walking in the park, talking to the cashier at the local grocery store.My father, who is ninety-one, recently had part of his stomach removed becauseof a suspected tumor. He is separated from my mother and lives alone. Hisrecovery was difficult, and he was losing weight for several weeks. So hestarted eating chocolate and other treats he had enjoyed in his youth but hadnot indulged in for many years. He resumed a daily exercise regimen. He not onlyregained the weight he had lost, but he also sounded happier when we spoke andlooked forward to each day. Making it to 110 in good health, in my father’scase, is less about social connections and great friendships and more aboutsimple things, like that long-forbidden chocolate bar. In the case of SalvatoreCaruso, who watched my father grow up, it was about competition. He wanted to bethe oldest man in the world. When I informed him that someone in Sicily wasolder, he said: “I have to beat him.” And he eventually did.Salvatore, someday I hope to beat you. I’ll see you on the other side, oldfriend. I hope it’s a very long time from now."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX A: LONGEVITY DIET TWO-WEEK MEAL PLANFN1 [footnotes.xhtml#fn-5]The following two-week meal plan is based on the Longevity Diet described inchapter 4 [chapter004.xhtml]. These recipes reflect the types of ingredients andcombinations most beneficial to your health. Feel free to substitute equivalentingredients while maintaining a similar nutrient composition. For example, whena recipe calls for pasta, you may replace it with whole-wheat pasta, barley,farro, semolina, polenta, gnocchi, or wild rice, keeping the portion within thesuggested 40-gram serving. This dietary plan was developed to maximize requiredlevels of vitamins and minerals without interfering with otherlongevity-promoting food components. Incorporate as many as possible of theingredients listed in the vitamins, minerals, and other micronutrient tables(see appendix B [appendix002.xhtml]). These are excellent sources of vitaminsand minerals commonly deficient in the Western diet: vitamin B12, vitamin D,folate, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, calcium, iron, magnesium, and omega-3(from fish oil or other sources). To prevent deficiencies, I encourage you totake a complete multivitamin and mineral pill and one omega-3 oil soft gel everythree days. This diet is ideal for people of normal weight, ages twenty tosixty-five years. After age sixty-five, calorie and protein intake should beadjusted up to prevent unwanted weight and muscle loss.The following diet consists of three meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) andone snack. It provides approximately 1,700 to 1,800 calories per day. This isthe average calorie requirement for a sedentary woman of normal height (5 feet,4 inches), weight (125 pounds), and body mass index (21.5) between the ages ofthirty-one and fifty, or a moderately active woman over age fifty-one. Men ofnormal height (5 feet, 8 inches), weight (152 pounds), and BMI (22.5) shouldincrease every ingredient in these recipes by approximately 20 percent. Theportion sizes should be adjusted based on the need to maintain or reach a normalbody weight (BMI and abdominal circumference; see chapter 4 [chapter004.xhtml]).Those who tend to lose weight and drop below the normal range may increase theportions of various dishes, while those who tend to gain weight may decreasethem or combine lunch and dinner while reducing portion sizes. The diet providesapproximately 55 to 60 percent of calories from carbohydrates, with most comingin the ideal complex-carbohydrate form contained in vegetables and grains, butalso in pasta and bread. There are virtually no components with sugar added,although sugar is present in fruit and other foods. The diet providesapproximately 30 to 35 percent of calories from fats, the great majority ofwhich are in the form of “healthy” unsaturated fats, and 10 to 11 percent ofcalories from proteins, with the great majority coming from plants and fish.The lunches and dinners are grouped into one low-calorie, low-protein meal andone high-calorie, high-protein meal providing all the necessary nutrients. Thehigh-calorie, high-protein meal contains at least 30 grams of protein tooptimize muscle growth (see chapter 5 [chapter005.xhtml]). Although low-proteinmeals are listed as lunches, they can be switched with dinners. However, Irecommend using the low-protein meals either for all the lunches or for all thedinners. All meals should be consumed within a daily twelve-hour window, and thelast meal should be consumed at least three to four hours before bedtime.IMPORTANT NOTICERemember that the calories you consume need to be adjusted according to yourbasal metabolic rate (BMR) and daily physical activity level (PAL). To calculateyour ideal daily protein intake, multiply your body weight in kilograms by 0.8(USDA, 2016; ISTAT, 2015; WHO, 2015). Achieving balance between caloriesconsumed and calories burned through daily physical activity is essential tomaintaining an ideal body weight and maximum health. Consuming just 150 caloriesa day beyond what your body needs can lead to ten pounds of extra body weightgained in twelve months. Note that the energy content and nutritional values ofany food component listed in the following diet may differ depending on thetypes and brands you choose.REFERENCES (DIET)“Balance Food and Activity.” Bethesda, MD: National Institutes of Health, 2016.Available fromhttp://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/wecan/healthy-weight-basics/balance.htm[http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/wecan/healthy-weight-basics/balance.htm].Country statistics: Italy.
