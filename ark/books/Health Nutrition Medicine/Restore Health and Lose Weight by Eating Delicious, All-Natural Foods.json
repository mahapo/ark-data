Medical bills are the leading cause of bankruptcy, and if you watch the evening news, it can easily feel like things are quickly taking a turn for the worse. Amongst all the fear, worry, and confusion though, there is a movement of people taking control of their own health and truly having fun doing it. This movement, how- ever, wouldn't be possible without the wellness leaders who work so hard to research what works, to share their experiences, and to create practical programs for others to follow. I wholeheartedly consider Penni Shelton a driving force behind this movement and a premier example of a health educator who has no agenda other than to see peo- ple healthy and happy. She has the heart of a teacher and a personal testimony that millions can relate to.

Instead of a program that takes weeks for results to show, Penni's tiered cleansing protocol delivers results every step of the way. The 3-Day Energy Boost Cleanse will gently ease you into the world of cleansing and support you need so that you don't get overwhelmed by the detox process. Once you've had a taste of what true health feels likes, you'll be ready to take on a deeper cleanse that will deliver even more profound results. All along the way you'll be supported by the fantastic recipes in the book, which are so satisfying that you might actu- ally forget you are cleansing. Most importantly, with each cleanse you do, you'll slowly begin to drop bad health habits that you never imagined you'd be able to leave behind-not because you have to, but because you'll want to. This is the power of cleansing. With every cleanse you take on, you teach your body to crave what is naturally best for it and in tum improve your overall health. This book, and the cleanses featured in it, will not only help you lose weight and transform your relationship with food, but it will also radically change your definition of what it means to be truly healthy.

Catastrophic disease in America is epidemic. This year 35 percent of all deaths will be due to cardiovascular dis- ease. At least one in four deaths are from cancer. Every sin- gle day, just under 8,000 people die from disease, which adds up to more American deaths annually than occurred during the entire Vietnam War. Over 4 million women are considered to be infertile. Depression, ADD, chronic fatigue syndrome, PMS and fibromyalgia affect 70 percent of American women over the age of 17. Now let's consider obesity. The American Heart Asso- ciation reports that among Americans 20 years old and older, 145 million Americans are overweight or obese. Over one third of American children are suffering from weight-related issues. The reality is that being overweight contributes to over 60 diseases. Finally, an alarming statistic is that a significant cause of death in America is from adverse reactions to medica- tions that were properly prescribed and taken correctly. The New England Journal of Medicine says that 2 million Americans fall ill and are hospitalized every year from reactions to prescription drugs. Of those 2 million, more than 140,000 die from that reaction. That puts adverse reactions in the same category as heart disease, cancer, dia- betes and strokes as a top cause of premature death in America today. It's not surprising that people are becoming more attuned to their own bodies and beginning to seek answers outside the sphere of modem medicine. Current statistics show that more and more Americans each year are seeking \"alternative\" medical approaches. Many indi- viduals I meet are interested in finding ways to build their 2"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"State of Our World health and pinpoint the source of their illness. People have grown weary of repeated visits to the doctor just to man- age symptoms. All of that being said, as I travel and give lectures I'm careful not to be too critical of physicians and hospitals. If I were in a life-threatening accident, I would want to be rushed to the closest emergency facility, and I'd be very thankful to have a skilled physician, surgeon and nursing staff to care for me. Today's doctors are not evil, nor are their contributions trivial, as some natural health educa- tors like to imply. Today's physicians have simply been taught, as we all have, that illness is normal and natural, especially as we age. Doctors fully expect that most people are simply going to get sick sooner or later. The problem I see is not with the skilled health care workers themselves, but with the fact that they don't receive a thorough background in nutrition. Because of this, they place minimal value on the importance of food and the role it plays in health and healing. Doctors today are exhaustively trained in treating the symptoms of dis- ease with pharmaceuticals, removing growths or cancers with surgical procedures and managing pain. However, there is not nearly enough emphasis on the statement made by the father of modem medicine, Hippocrates: \"Let thy food be thy medicine and thy medicine be thy food.\" My 16-year-old daughter was diagnosed with mild to moderate depression around the time she reached puberty. Her father and I made an appointment with a highly respected adolescent psychologist to discuss treatment options. Being the natural health advocate that I am, I broached the subject of diet and shared my concern regarding my teenager's poor food choices. I added that I thought there was a vitamin/ mineral deficiency at play as 3"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"RAW FOOD CLEANSE well as social and situational concerns contributing to the problem. This professional and two other doctors we saw were not interested in discussing dietary changes or adding supplements to the list of possible treatments. They all felt that my daughter was a typical teenager, enjoying a diet rich in fast food, and that her daily choices of pizza, French fries, chocolate ice cream and soda had no bearing on her mental health. It was through that trying experience, and others like it, that I learned the importance of knowing when to look to allopathic medicine and when to explore holistic treat- ments. Both can be viable options. Learning how to take charge of your own personal health and well-being, and that of your loved ones, is just another facet of achieving optimum health. I'm also encouraged as I learn of more cutting-edge, trailblazing physicians who are educating themselves and in tum offering their patients new options of care that combine holistic and Western medical tradi- tions. I'm hopeful that we'll see this trend grow over time. Exploring our society's dietary history helps enlighten us as to why we are faced with many of today's degenera- tive diseases. Before the 1940s, only a small percentage of the foods we ate were processed. Since 1940, the consump- tion of whole grains has decreased by at least 50 percent. The regular consumption of locally grown fresh fruits and vegetables has decreased by a startling amount, yet the quantity of sugar in our diet has doubled. The regular in- take of processed foods has increased fourfold, and food- coloring additives are loaded into nearly everything pack- aged or processed. Soft drink consumption is up 300 percent since the 1940s, and currently 90 percent of the standard American diet is made up of foods that have been 4"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"State of Our World processed in some way. Statistics show that 90 percent of every food dollar is spent on processed foods. Yikes. So, our body chemistry has evolved over millions of years, but our current lifestyle has only developed over the last hundred years, becoming even more dramatically altered after the Second World War. As our lives have become more modernized and hectic to meet the demands of this present age, our diets have followed suit. We began consuming an increased number of toxins and denatured foods, and our stress levels skyrocketed. In some very fundamental ways, modem civilization, with its mind- boggling technological advances, has actually compro- mised us more than it has helped us. Now we live in a society that eagerly accepts fast foods, even those that are heavily processed and loaded with chemicals, as a way of life for the average American, at any age. Few people give any real thought to what they are actually eating as they cruise to the nearest drive-thru to get their daily fix of overly processed, denatured food that is devoid of most essential nutrients. The typical modem diet is proving to be more and more detrimental to our health. And the fact that many of our modem health-care professionals close their eyes to this reality in treating our illnesses, whether acute or degenerative, is cause for alarm. As a country we are getting sicker and sicker, even though we have the most advanced medical technology in the world. As we've already discussed, medical technol- ogy is geared toward treating symptoms, not identifying their causes. I am still baffled that our universities and medical schools are not offering or requiring more nutritional cur- riculum. Research consistently shows that 85 percent of the degenerative diseases in this country are linked to 5"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"RAW FOOD CLEANSE poor lifestyle, in particular, to our diet. The vast majority of people would prefer to spend their money and energy looking for quick fixes rather than actually changing their lifestyle. I've heard it said that it's easier for a person to consider changing their religion than it is for them to make lasting changes to their diet. And a question I get asked all the time by skeptical friends and acquaintances is, \"Does food really matter?\" I believe it does. There are natural laws and a natural order to this life. Our Creator designed it that way. Gravity is a perfect example. You may totally believe that you can leap from the top of a four-story building and fly; you may even be able to convince others of this. The reality is that if you do jump, you will hit the ground. Real health functions under the same kind of law. You may choose to eat a diet rich in animal fats, processed grains and sugars, caffeinated bev- erages and sports drinks, and even if you believe that it won't affect your health, eventually it will catch up to you. Along with an evaluation of our diet, we must also examine the environmental dangers in today's world. The modernization of our society has not only created a mas- sive amount of accommodating fast foods, it has also cre- ated other modem conveniences that have taxed our envi- ronment. There are many chemicals and other toxic materials that have been created largely by industry. These chemicals have infiltrated our water, our food and our precious air supply. Unfortunately we can't see, feel or smell many of these toxins. In many cases, people don't comprehend the effects these toxins have on our bodies until they receive a diagnosis of a chronic disease years after exposure. The most encouraging news on the subject of environ- mental toxins is that there is a growing movement at a 6"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"State of Our World grassroots level that is bringing much of what is going wrong to the surface. Environmental activists and organi- zations are springing up all over the planet and the once faint voice is growing louder and stronger. More and more people are becoming aware of what is happening across our globe and how it is adversely affecting our health and the health of our young children. Although I see encourag- ing changes, more large-scale efforts are needed. I believe things will continue to evolve as we educate and empower ourselves and others. It's true that industrialization within our culture has created poor dietary habits and a sick environment, but it has also brought with it another insidious factor that threatens our health. I am convinced that lifestyle stresses may be equally damaging, if not more so, to our overall health. The pressures of our everyday lives are at crisis levels, yet we have become so desensitized that the hectic way we live seems normal. The overstimulation and the busy pace of a modem culture leads to emotional and relational imbalances, lack of exercise and poor elimination. A high percentage of people struggle with addictions of all kinds in an effort to just get through the day and cope. Although it is a sad state of affairs, it is within our grasp to transform and alter the course of our lives. We just have to recognize the need, then learn how to change and become empowered to do so. Knowledge is power, and my hope is that this little book will surprise you, give you hope, encourage and equip you with the practical tools to redirect your life onto the path of reclaiming your own optimal health.

Accurate information equips and inspires, and it is my hope that the truths presented here will be a catalyst for positive change and renewed health along your journey. Did you know that over 77,000 chemicals are pro- duced in North America? There are over 3,000 chemicals added to our food supplies, over 10,000 chemical solvents, emulsifiers and preservatives used for food processing, and over 1,000 new chemicals introduced each year. I don't know about you, but to me these numbers are pretty overwhelming. So what effects do these toxins have on our bodies? A study by the British Medical Journal says that 75 percent of most cancers are caused by environmental and lifestyle factors. A report by the Columbia University School of Public Health estimates that 95 percent of cancer is caused by diet and environmental toxicity. I've read in numerous places that Americans have between 400 and 800 chemi- cals stored in their bodies, mainly in their fatty tissues. What are the short- and long-term effects of these toxins? Check this list out: • Neurological disorders (Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, depression, ADD and ADHD, schizophrenia, etc.) • Enzyme dysfunction • Nutritional deficiencies • Altered metabolism • Hormonal imbalances • Reproductive disorders • Chronic fatigue • Headaches I migraines • Obesity • Muscle and vision problems 9"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"RAW FOOD CLEANSE • Suppressed immunity • Allergies I asthma • Endocrine disorders • Chronic viral infections Like me, you may be wondering what everyday chem- icals are especially heinous to humans. Here is a list of the top 10 most common toxins found in our environment: ASBESTOS This insulating material was widely used from the 1950s to the 1970s. Problems arise when the mate- rial becomes old and crumbly and releases fibers into the air. Risks include scarring of the lung tissue and cancer, including a rare form of cancer called mesothelioma. Main sources of asbestos include insulation on floors and ceil- ings, water pipes and leaking ducts (especially in build- ings from the 1950s-1970s). CHLORINE This highly toxic yellow-green gas is one of the most heavily used chemical agents. Risks include eye and skin irritation, severe eye and skin burns, blue coloring of the skin, sore throat, coughing, rapid breath- ing, narrowing of the bronchi, wheezing, accumulation of fluid in the lungs, pain in the lung region, lung collapse, and reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS; a type of asthma). Main sources include household cleaners, public drinking water (even in small amounts), and air near factories that use chlorine in industrial processes (e.g., paper plants). CHLOROFORM This colorless liquid has a pleasant, nonirritating odor and a slightly sweet taste, and is used to make other chemicals. It's also formed when chlorine is added to water. Risks include cancer, reproductive dam- age, birth defects, dizziness, fatigue, headache, and liver and kidney damage. Air, drinking water, and food can contain chloroform. 10"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Our Human Condition: The Cause & Effect of Our Toxic World DIOXINS These are chemical compounds formed as a result of combustion processes such as commercial or municipal waste incineration and from burning fuels (like wood, coal or oil). Risks include cancer, reproductive and developmental disorders, chloracne (a severe skin disease with acne-like lesions), skin rashes, skin discoloration, excessive body hair and mild liver damage. Over 95 per- cent of exposure comes from eating commercial animal fats. HEAVY METALS Metals like arsenic, mercury, lead, aluminum and cadmium, which are prevalent in many areas of our environment, can accumulate in soft tissues of the body. Risks include cancer, neurological disorders, Alz- heimer's disease, foggy head, fatigue, nausea and vomit- ing, decreased production of red and white blood cells, abnormal heart rhythm and damage to blood vessels. Main sources include public drinking water, fish, vaccines, pesticides, preserved wood, antiperspirant, building mate- rials, dental amalgams and chlorine plants. MOLD AND OTHER FUNGAL TOXINS Thirty-three percent of people have had an allergic reaction to mold. Mycotoxins (fungal toxins) can cause a range of health problems even with only a small exposure. Risks include cancer, heart disease, asthma, multiple sclerosis and dia- betes. Main sources include contaminated buildings, foods like peanuts, wheat and com, and alcoholic beverages. PCBS (POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS) This indus- trial chemical has been banned in the United States for decades, yet is an unrelenting organic pollutant that's still present in our environment. Risks include cancer and impaired fetal brain development. Avoid eating farm- raised salmonj they are fed meals of ground-up fish that have absorbed PCBs in the environment. 11"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"RAW FOOD CLEANSE PESTICIDES According to the Environmental Protec- tion Agency (EPA), 60 percent of herbicides, 90 percent of fungicides and 30 percent of insecticides are known to be carcinogenic. I find it alarming that pesticide residues have been detected in 50 to 95 percent of U.S. foods. Risks include cancer, Parkinson's disease, miscarriage, nerve damage, birth defects, and blocked absorption of food nutrients. Main sources include bug sprays, conventional fruits and vegetables, and commercially raised meats. PHTHALATES These chemicals are used to lengthen the life of fragrances and soften plastics. Risks include endocrine system damage (phthalates chemically mimic hormones and are particularly dangerous to children). Plastic wrap, plastic bottles and plastic food-storage con- tainers can leach phthalates into our food. VOCS (VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS) VOCs are a major contributing factor to ozone, an air pollutant. According to the EPA, VOCs tend to be 200-500 percent more concentrated in indoor air than outdoor air, likely because they are present in so many household products. Risks include cancer, eye and respiratory tract irritation, headaches, dizziness, visual disorders and memory impairment. Main sources include drinking water, carpet, paints, deodorants, cleaning fluids, varnishes, cosmetics, dry-cleaned clothing, moth repellents and air fresheners. I realize that this is a threatening list of dangerous pol- lutants; however, you can minimize your exposure and even overcome many of the injurious side effects by mak- ing mindful dietary and lifestyle changes.

Well, the real truth is that we are what we eat, digest and assimilate. Learning to enjoy foods in their natural, fresh, raw state is the best way to ensure that you will digest and assimilate the most nutri- ents possible. The processing of food strips it of its essen- tial nutrients by overheating and oxidation-and then there's the addition of toxic materials. Nature designed our foods in a complete package with all the nutrients and enzymes needed to digest and assimilate them into a usable state. When whole foods are stripped of part of the original package, they become nutrient-draining to our bodies rather than life-giving and nutrient-dense. Unfor- tunately, our bodies must be robbed of needed nutrients and enzymes in order to break down this denatured food. Choosing mostly fresh, raw, organic and locally har- vested foods, like those you'd find at a farmers' market, makes for an ideal diet. If there are no farmers' markets near you selling locally grown, seasonal fruits and vegeta- 19"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"RAW FOOD CLEANSE bles, the next best choice is to support grocers like Whole Foods or other healthy natural food stores. Conventionally grown produce is often deficient in nutrients for a number of reasons. The soil is often overworked and lacking in minerals; the vegetation has generally been treated with multiple pesticides, herbicides, larvicides, fungicides and chemical fertilizers; and produce has often been shipped from around the world. Aside from eating fresh, raw whole foods, the next best way to maximize nutrition for your body is through juicing or blending whole foods. The freshly extracted juices of fruits and vegetables deliver easily assimilated, instant nutrients into the system. No matter how chal- lenged one's digestion may be, juicing is the definitive way to maximize the absorption of vitamins, minerals and amino acids. Even the most compromised, sickly, nutrient- deficient body can greatly benefit from juiced and blended raw whole foods. Acclaimed health retreats around the world utilize juicing in the healing and detoxification process of their patients. There are volumes of docu- mented cases of cancers and other degenerative diseases being successfully treated and healed with the nutritional support of fresh vegetable and fruit juices. One must consume fresh juices immediately after extracting. Once the skin of a fruit or vegetable is broken, oxidation begins and the food begins to lose nutritional value. We desperately need these live and active enzymes in order to help rejuvenate and repair our bodies. Although often underrated by doctors and nutritionists, enzymes are vital players in helping you regain your most vibrant health. Along with juicing, drying or dehydrating is another nutrient-maximizing food preparation. Drying has been 20"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"What We Should Be Eating Now used as a method of preserving foods for thousands of years and by many cultures. Long before the invention of refrigeration, people were putting fresh foods into the sun to dry so they could enjoy them at a later time. Dehydrated foods keep and travel well, but look for foods that have been dried with no chemicals or additives. Foods that have been dried at less than 115 degrees retain about 95 percent or more of their nutritional value, which makes them a great staple to store for the winter. A dehy- drator is a money-saving purchase if you're committed to improving the integrity of your health (see the Resources section for more information). What about eating frozen foods? Obviously it's not always possible to find fresh produce, especially in the winter months, so freezing or buying frozen is a suitable option. Do you read labels when buying frozen produce? Choose organic whenever possible and look for companies that flash freeze immediately after picking. Frozen foods retain 70 to 95 percent of their nutrients, depending on the freezing practice. Although this book is titled Raw Food Cleanse, lightly steamed foods can be a healthy alternative when you desire warm foods in the colder months. Be careful not to over-steam. When steamed foods begin to lose color and feel limp, they are overcooked and have lost a significant amount of their nutritional value. Any preparation that heats food to over 115 degrees depletes all of the living enzymes that help your body digest and assimilate what you swallow. Depending upon how long you cook your food, this process will not only kill all the living enzymes, it will also cause a 50 to 100 percent depletion of the nutrients in your food. I find that people are resistant if you tell them that baking, broiling, 21"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"RAW FOOD CLEANSE grilling or steaming foods for too long limits the body's ability to process them efficiently. But even my husband, a self-proclaimed grilling master, has started being more mindful of how long he leaves his food on the fire. Microwaved leftovers, commercially canned foods and fried foods have all lost close to 100 percent of their nutritional value. Processed cooked foods with additives, which make up a huge portion of the typical American diet, not only have zero nutritional value, they also have toxins added to them that significantly increase your chances of degenerative illness. I am convinced that this is why we have a country filled with overfed, undernour- ished adults and children. People keep eating, plugging themselves until they're stuffed with nutrient-depleted foods, but they are still hungry. Their bodies are crying out for the vital nutrition that satisfies, nourishes and heals. A big missing link in mainstream approaches to weight loss and health is the study of the acid/ alkaline balance. It you've consumed a typical American diet for any significant length of time, you are most likely dealing with an acid issue. One of the main goals of the Raw Food Cleanse is to move your body out of its acidic state and into a more alkaline environment. Are You Too Acidic? The following foods and lifestyle choices may lead to an acid problem. • Meat, including chicken, pork,. turkey and fish • Dairy products, including eggs • Bread, pasta, potatoes, and baked goods • Cigarettes and other forms of tobacco • Alcohol, prescription and recreational drugs 22"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"What We Should Be Eating Now • Coffee and most commercial teas • Processed or fast foods • Sugar • Artificial sweeteners • Soft drinks and sports drinks • No exercise • Stress, negative emotions and spiritual emptiness Another factor that stalls weight loss is dehydration. High acid levels and lack of hydration have something in common. Check this out Your body retains fat as a protec- tion against the acids produced by the lifestyle outlined in the above list. Some of the acids are eliminated through the bowels, urinary tract and skin, but whatever is left behind has to be buffered and neutralized. In the same way your body manages to sustain an ideal body tempera- ture of around 98.6 degrees, your body also intrinsically knows to maintain a pH balance that is within very precise boundaries. Your ingeniously created system goes to impressive lengths to keep you in balance by storing fat, building cholesterol plaque, draining calcium from bones, and leaching magnesium out of your heart or muscles. This all happens as your body battles to protect against acid damage. The human body is composed of approximately 65 percent water, which means that we're made up of some- where between 10 and 13 gallons of water. We've already said that we are what we eat, but we are also quite literally what we drink. When you're dehydrated, your body goes into preservation or fat-storing mode. Every day that you don't drink enough water or drink the wrong things, you put your body at additional risk and on some level com- promise your health. If your body has been dealing with a major acid intake, your fat is actually protecting your cells, 23"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"RAW FOOD CLEANSE tissues and organs. This may be a new perspective, but there's a good chance that your stored fat is actually work- ing to save your life! In a nutshell, along with consuming an acid-forming diet, being dehydrated can likely lead to weight gain. There is also a tendency for the body to send confusing sig- nals to your brain. An example of this is that many of us mistake thirst/ dehydration for hunger, so we eat when we really need to be drinking. If we don't get enough water, our bodies actually retain water and feel bloated and uncomfortable. Lack of water is the number-one cause of daytime fatigue. Do you recognize any of these symptoms? Symptoms of Dehydration • Weakness and fatigue • Problems focusing and concentrating • Drowsiness • Impatience and irritability • Headaches or migraines • Brain fogi clouded thinking • Short-term memory loss • Trouble articulating • Lightheadedness • Cold hands and feet • Anxiety • Depression Besides the above list, degenerative conditions including morbid obesity, heart disease and cancer are all linked with serious long-term dehydration. Sounds shocking, but it's true. So the question is, how much water should you be drinking? Half your body weight in ounces daily is opti- 24"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"What We Should Be Eating Now mal, which means that if you weigh 200 pounds you should be drinking 100 ounces of pure water each day. If you are very active or out in the hot sun for extended peri- ods, this amount needs to increase. The good news is that you may also count any freshly extracted fruit and veg- etable juices, herbal teas and the liquid from young coco- nuts toward your daily total. I hope you have followed my train of thought regard- ing proper hydration and the importance of re-alkalinizing your body. Many studies and reports are being released showing that cancer and other degenerative diseases can't survive in an alkaline environment. In order to cleanse the body and lose weight for good, we must transition away from the typical American diet. Setting a goal of eating 80 percent whole, fresh, raw, ripe, organic focus foods will give you amazing results. As we've seen, these foods are the healthiest for your body due to their nutritional profiles and their alkaline-forming properties. They are the healing and life-giving foods that your body needs to rejuvenate, restore health and bring your body into homeostasis. The other 20 percent of your diet is up to your com- mon sense. People with compromised immunity, those who are obese, individuals with degenerative disease, and those with severe food allergies or sensitivities will likely need to consider carefully how they approach this 20 per- cent. Many will choose to be 100 percent raw-and will generally reap faster results in doing so-while others pre- fer to use this 20 percent for social dining occasions, when traveling, and in other situations to help them function more comfortably in society.

I also recommend the following alkaline-forming superfoods that will support your immunity, fight disease and encourage lasting weight loss. Alkaline-forming Superfoods YOUNG THAI COCONUTS One of the most powerful superfoods to help with both hydration and alkalinity is the young Thai coconut. The liquid within a young coconut is the most incredible, pure, 27"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"RAW FOOD CLEANSE delicious water. It is one of the richest sources of elec- trolytes known to man. Forget the commercial sports drinks! This amazing water, or milk, as some call it, is nearly identical to blood plasma. When we drink fresh coconut water, it's as if we've given ourselves an instant blood transfusion. Young coconuts are preferable to the more mature brown coconuts; they are most health- enhancing in their early stages of growth. The meat of the young coconut contains lauric acid, known for its beneficial antimicrobial effects. Coconut meat and coconut oil do not contain trans-fatty acids. Most of the saturated fat in coconut oil consists of medium- chain fatty acids. This good fat gets digested and assimi- lated more easily: it is less likely to be stored in the body as fat and can actually help you burn more fat. In addition to antiviral and antibacterial properties, natural coconut fat helps normalize body lipids, protects against liver damage and, most importantly, improves the immune sys- tem's anti-inflammatory response. Good saturated fats such as these also contain micronutrients and vitamins that are vital to metabolism. Young coconuts can be found in most health food stores and Asian markets, or you can find organic sources online. CHIA SEEDS Nothing compares to the chia seed when it comes to hydration and endurance. Once soaked, these tiny seeds open up and absorb nine times their volume in water. The seeds, once fully hydrated, form a gel that is phenomenal at keeping your body hydrated. This gel is also 90 percent soluble fiber, which is beneficial for your digestive tract and helps to lower cholesterol even more effectively than oatmeal. And talk about an impressive nutritional profile: 28"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"What We Should Be Eating Now the seeds have twice the protein of any other seed or grain, five times the calcium of milk, and copious amounts of omega-3 and omega-6, essential oils for the body. Because of the soluble fiber in the gel, incorporating chia into one's diet is very helpful for people with diabetes: the gel forms a wall around ingested carbohydrates, causing them to be released more gradually. Savvy dieters love the seeds be- cause the gel can be added to foods or drinks without changing their flavor, and it helps provide a feeling of full- ness and satisfaction. Using the hydrated seeds is an excel- lent way to control one's appetite. Although these seeds have superstar status, they are very affordable and are car- ried at most health food stores. One word of warning: Don't use chia seeds unless you have soaked them for at least 10 minutes. If you eat them dry, they will actually use your bodily fluid to expand, and that can cause digestive issues and dehydration. BEE POLLEN Along with local raw honey, bee pollen is one of the most amazing foods you will ever eat. My friends Gabriel Cousens and David Rainoshek, both well-respected in the natural health movement, share the opinion that bee pollen contains all the elements necessary for the suste- nance of human life. The San Francisco Medical Research Foundation estimates that pollen has more than 5,000 dif- ferent enzymes and co-enzymes-more than any other food in existence. The high amount of enzymes, such as catalase, amy- lase, and pectin-splitting enzymes, make pollen an aid to digestion. Some research suggests that pollen is absorbed directly from the stomach into the bloodstream. Pollen is a vegetarian source of human-active B12, most of the B vita- mins, vitamins A, C, D and E, rutin, lecithin, all the essen- 29"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"RAW FOOD CLEANSE tial amino acids, the essential fatty acid called linoleic acid, fats, complex carbohydrates, simple sugars, and many other beneficial agents that are still being studied. According to research by doctors from France, Italy, and the former Soviet Union, pollen is the richest source of protein in nature. Gram for gram, pollen contains an esti- mated five to seven times more protein than meat, eggs or cheese. lhe protein in pollen is in a predigested form and therefore easy to assimilate. When you try it for the first time, simply place a cou- ple of granules under your tongue to check for any allergic response. (Only about 1 to 2 percent of the population is allergic to bee pollen.) You can find pollen at Whole Foods Market or online (see the Resources section for a list of rec- ommended online retailers). HEMP SEEDS Hemp seeds contain all the essential amino and fatty acids necessary to maintain healthy human life. No other single plant source has the essential amino acids in such an easily digestible form, or the essential fatty acids in such a per- fect ratio to meet human nutritional needs. As one of nature's most perfect foods, hemp seeds contain all 10 essential amino acids, the building blocks of protein. Hemp is also rich in naturally balanced omega-3 and omega-6 essential fatty acids, not to mention magnesium, iron, potassium, fiber and phytonutrients, plus natural antioxi- dants like vitamin E. I highly recommend hemp seeds, as they are one of the plant kingdom's best sources of easily digestible, high- quality protein. To my knowledge, these amazing seeds are the highest vegan source of simple protein, which is required for proper immune system function. 30"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"What We Should Be Eating Now Hemp is the perfect alternative protein, much less likely to cause allergic reactions and much less mucus- forming than dairy and soy sources. Adding hemp protein to your morning smoothie is a great way to support your entire system and power up for your day. Many vegan super-athletes supplement their daily dietary regime with hemp and spirulina. SPIRULINA Spirulina is both a food from the past and a food for the future. Some scientists speculate that the manna of the wandering Israelites, which appeared miraculously on rocks following a devastating dry spell and was described as tasting like wafers made with honey, may in fact have been a form of dried, dormant spirulina. Spirulina is an exceptional food and an incredible source of concentrated, absorbable nutrients. Because it is 65 to 70 percent complete protein with all essential amino acids in perfect balance, it's a highly beneficial substitute for protein powders. lhis amazing blue-green algae also contains vitamins A, Bl, B2, B6, B12, E and K. In addition, spirulina provides minerals, trace minerals, cell salts, phy- tonutrients and enzymes, as well as an abundance of chlo- rophyll and other beneficial pigments. Beef is only 22 percent protein and is very difficult for most individuals to digest and assimilate. Even soybeans are only 34 percent protein. This makes spirulina one of the world's highest known sources of usable protein. The reason I believe that vegan sources of protein are superior is that proteins from animals form relatively large amounts of uric acid, which can contribute to osteoporosis, gout, arthritis, lack of energy, acidic body chemistry, aging and more! Add powdered spirulina to your smoothies, 31"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"RAW FOOD CLEANSE juices, soups and sprinkle it on your salads for an intense source of nutrient density and added protein daily. WHEATGRASS Wheatgrass is an amazing blood purifier, cleanser and detoxifier. It contains chlorophyll, which helps carry oxy- gen to every cell in your body. Oxygen in the body's cells helps fight off harmful bacteria and diseases-even the most insidious diseases, like cancer. Wheatgrass must be squeezed, juiced or blended, and strained in order to as- similate its nutrients. Wheatgrass is grown from the wheat seed or wheat berry, which is farmed in almost every U.S. state and around the globe. People with wheat allergies need not be concerned about consuming wheatgrass juice; it is a leafy green that is different from the grain and refined-grain products. This super-grass is also a complete protein with meganutrients when grown in an organic soil base. My well-respected friends at the Hippocrates Health Institute suggest drinking wheatgrass juice in small amounts throughout the day, always on an empty stom- ach. Two to four ounces every day is sufficient. Slowly sip- ping small quantities of the juice will give your body an opportunity to get used to its taste and effects. Taking one to two ounces straight or mixed into other green juices or smoothies and sipping slowly will prevent nausea or upset stomach, as this is one of nature's most powerful detoxing and revitalizing agents. In addition to the Raw Food Cleanse dietary protocols, I suggest drinking one or two ounces of wheatgrass up to three or four times per day with one day of rest periodically. Although, be advised: with wheatgrass, more is not better. Two ounces at any one given time is all one person needs. 32"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"4 The Ultimate Raw Food Cleanse This segment of the book is devoted to a number of differ- ent dietary cleanses.

We're moving in a positive direction as we become em- powered and act as bringers of light and change. I've recently been working with my 16-year-old daughter, Gabrielle, to teach her the importance of considering her goals and mapping her desired destinations in life. Every choice we make moves us either one step closer to or one step further away from our ultimate goals.

It's important that you make a game plan for your long-term success right now, determining what newfound strategies you want to incorporate into your daily life. Maintaining your detox and living in vibrant health doesn't just happen. It takes a plan-and the desire to exe- cute the plan-on your own part and even on the part of those whom your transformation will impact. As I shared in Chapter 3, you need to grab hold of the truth that you can be an example to others of what's possible. Once you seize that truth, you will be the influence, not the one who is influenced! As I write this book, I can tell you that for many years I have been working on acquiring a taste for a lifestyle that brings lasting benefits. I haven't always gravitated natu- rally toward the healthiest choices, and I've had many breakdowns along the way. It is through my own personal struggles and victories that I have become the natural health advocate that I am today. It is not because I have more willpower, more resources or more motivation than youi it is because I've simply been stubborn enough to never give up. I've kept my heart open, pressing into the power of change. The truth that has helped me the most in attaining my goals is that our thoughts and words greatly influence our relationships, self-esteem, finances, attitude, and yes, even our weight and health. Many world-renowned teachers and counselors emphasize this concept, but truly under- standing and implementing it doesn't come naturally to most of us. There is a very real connection between rela- tionships, food, focus, service and your health. What programming in your life has been holding you back from reaching your highest potential?

It is crucial to your opti- mal health that you begin to feed your body living, vibrant, easy-to-assimilate foods. It is equally important that you find a way to feed your mind positive, truthful words that bring life and joy to your soul. You aren't reading these words by coincidence. This little book is a special delivery that was written to give you hope and point you in the right direction. Today is a new day, a fresh start and an opportunity to intentionally and lovingly take charge of what you put into your mouth and into your brain! If you are feeling down, feeling like you are a failure or are out of control, you are not alone. Now is the time to take control of your mind and stop focusing your energy on your negative circumstances. Yes, you have the power within you to take charge of your stinkin' thinkin'! Start keeping your goals, your true heart's desire for optimal health, your list of why you are tired of failing and your list of how you are going to start succeeding constantly in front of you. Joumaling is the very best thing for this. Unplug from all the lies and negativity that hold you back. Read positive things, speak and write positive words about your own life, even if you think nobody else believes in or respects you. The old thoughts that are no longer serving your higher good will not support you toward meeting your new, higher-resonating goals. Another truth is that sometimes the road to real and lasting change can be lonely. When I made the commit- ment to change my diet and life once and for all, I had to make some other decisions that seemed to go against my nature and old desires. I had to stop spending time with people who didn't care about my ultimate well-being.

These are not bad people, but they may be only looking out for ways to vali- date themselves and protect their own egos. The saying \"misery loves company\" is one you can take to the bank. If you are an alcoholic and you make the decision to give up drinking, your common sense tells you to stay away from the bar, right? Don't drive down the street where the liquor store is if you can't handle the tempta- tion. Likewise, don't put yourself in situations that will sabotage your success in following a diet that will help you lose weight and revitalize your life. Stop looking for empty validation from your unhealthy, stuck, overweight friends. Although they may mean well, they will gladly take you to an early grave with them. What I'm sharing here may sound harsh, but for many of you it is going to take some radical changes in your mental, physical, spiritual and social surroundings for you to finally arrive where you want to be. And you thought this chapter was just going to tell you how to decrease your exposure to environmental and dietary toxins! It fas- cinates me how interconnected all of this is and how, when we set our heart and intentions on going to the next level, the needed support will manifest in ways that are both confirming and authentic. Start looking for new opportu- nities, road signs and the divine interventions that are just waiting to guide you, and most of all, enjoy the ride.

What you can do, however, is limit your exposure as much as possible by doing the following: • Buy, grow and eat, as much as possible, organic pro- duce and free-range, organic foods. • If you eat fish, consume wild-caught fish (which is most likely not contaminated with PCBs and mer- cury), making sure it comes from a reputable source. Generally, large health-food distributors like Whole Foods or sustainable-friendly fishmongers have the market share of these kinds of fish. • Avoid processed foods-they are all processed with chemicals. • Only use natural cleaning products in your home. See the Resources section in the back of this book for recommendations. • Switch over to natural brands of toiletries, including shampoo, toothpaste, antiperspirants and cosmetics. Again, see the Resources section for suggestions. • As soon as you are financially able, remove any metal dental fillings. They're a major source of mer- cury. Be sure to have this done by a qualified bio- logical dentist. • Avoid using artificial air fresheners, scented dryer sheets, fabric softeners or other synthetic fragrances as they can irritate your skin and pollute the air you are breathing. • Avoid artificial food additives of all kinds, includ- ing artificial sweeteners and MSG. • Get plenty of safe sun exposure to boost your vita- min D levels and your immune system (you'll be better able to fight disease).

I now have a showerhead that filters out chlorine and my chronic problem with excessive skin itching is a thing of the past. Drinking filtered, purified, or spring water is a huge benefit to your health. Don't take my advice: research it for yourself. • Start switching over to glass containers (like Mason jars) to store your food instead of plastic contain- ers. The plastic might be leaching chemicals into your food. • If you are going to eat cooked food, don't use a microwave to cook or heat it. • Whenever possible, put your cell phone or even your cordless home phone on speaker when you're talking to someone. The less time it's up near your brain, the better! • Minimize your exposure to sources of radiation and electromagnetic fields (EMFs). Unplug your elec- tronics-computers, televisions and other such devices-as often as possible. Don't agree to rou- tine x-rays unless you are in a dire health crisis. Go outside and walk barefoot to get grounded and to help neutralize and balance your compromised energy field. 146"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Life Practices for Ageless Health 7 Any successful effort to improve one's life requires paying attention to habitual behaviors. Most of us who have struggled with weight and poor heal~ or are simply feel- ing stuck in life, have some self-sabotaging habits that are getting in the way of positive and lasting change. Lasting transformations happen in the lives of people every day, but most life makeovers include focusing your attention on crowding out defeating habits and replacing them with new, higher-resonating rituals. As I mentioned in Chapter 4, any of the Raw Food Cleanses are best combined with the lifestyle practices shared in this chapter. Your ultimate success will be greatly enhanced when you include nurturing rituals like journaling, daily body movement, attention to your daily elimination, care for your body and skin, adequate sun- light, prayer I meditation and building a sense of service and community that will support your new and improved way of life. 147"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"RAW FOOD CLEANSE Journaling Journaling can be one of the most effective tools to help you uncover what's been working well in your life and what hasn't. It's impossible to face behaviors if we aren't aware of them, so journaling is a valuable way to explore and pay attention to what's really going on. Within the safety of your own written words, you can let your ideas and feelings flow freely, and follow them wherever they lead you. Over time your journal will give you a broader and more accurate perspective on yourself and your jour- ney. You may be unaware of how long you have been grap- pling with a particular issue or challenge, but rereading entries from previous months and even years will offer you a clear perspective and allow you to see recurring themes. Getting honest about where you are and where you want to be can become life-transforming. You get to decide who you want to be, and you can change your mind at any time. For many people, a shift in mindset begins to create tangible changes in their daily lives. But until you can allow yourself this personal freedom in real life, use journaling to try on different ways of being and expressing yourself. Write as though you are already the fearless, lim- itless being you aspire to be. Journaling is risk-free, private and no one but you is affected by what you write. Your journal will not resist change or pressure you to be who it thinks you ought to be! Breathing Breathing is so simple and fundamental, yet we often take it for granted, ignoring the power it has to affect our body, mind and spirit. Correct breathing is critically important for two reasons: it is the only means to supply our bodies 148"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Life Practices for Ageless Health and various organs with vital oxygen, and it's an impor- tant means of purging waste and toxins from the body. Oxygen is the most vital nutrient for our bodies. It is essential to the integrity of the brain, nerves, glands and internal organs. We can do without food for weeks and without water for days, but without oxygen, we will die within a few minutes. If the brain doesn't get a proper supply of this essential nutrient, it will result in depriva- tion of all vital organs in the body. Oxygen is vital to our well-being, and any effort to increase the supply of oxy- gen, especially to the brain, will pay rich rewards. Deep breathing is important because it makes your lymphatic system work better. The lymph system is like the body's sewage system. Every cell in your body is sur- rounded by lymph. Did you know that the lymphatic sys- tem is twice the size of your other circulatory system? Twice as much lymph as blood is present in our bodies, and we have twice as many lymph vessels as blood ves- sels. One of the keys to good health is to keep your lym- phatic system open and flowing freely. The next essential life practice for ageless health is body movement. Notice that I don't use the word exercise. For many of us who have struggled with weight-related issues, the utterance of the word can hold certain negative connotations. So if for no other reason than my own men- tal trickery, I prefer to use the term body movement. Body Movement Just as deep breathing brings oxygen to an often-sluggish bloodstream and clogged lymph system, simple and en- joyable body movement can and often is the catalyst that ushers in deep healing and more rapid weight loss. The 149"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"RAW FOOD CLEANSE options of movement are nearly limitless; however, there are particular forms of activity that will support and nur- ture you most effectively as you begin to focus on giving your body the attention and care it deserves. WALKING Walking is the most gentle, low-impact exercise that will ease you into a higher level of health and fitness while promoting an overall sense of well-being. Our bodies were created for walking, so it is clearly the most natural form of body movement. It's safe, simple and doesn't require practice, equipment or a gym membership. My doctor shared a list from the Mayo Clinic during my last checkup, outlining the health benefits associated with walking just 30 minutes per day: • Lowering LDL cholesterol (the \"bad\" cholesterol) • Raising HDL cholesterol (the \"good\" cholesterol) • Lowering your blood pressure • Reducing your risk of or managing type 2 diabetes • Losing and managing weight • Improving your mood • Staying strong and fit YOGA Another favored form of body movement is yoga. Yoga is a cleansing practice that has proven to be extremely effec- tive for alleviating various disorders. Yoga is also particu- larly helpful in these ways: • Increasing flexibility. Yoga positions work on vari- ous joints that are often overlooked with other forms of exercise. Some people have also reported experi- encing remarkable flexibility in areas of the body that have not been consciously worked upon. When 150"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Life Practices for Ageless Health done as a flow, yoga positions work in harmony to create flexibility throughout your entire body. • Increasing lubrication in the joints, ligaments and tendons. • Massaging of all the organs of the body. Yoga is per- haps the only form of activity that massages all the internal glands and organs of the body in such a thorough manner. • Detoxification. By gently stretching muscles and joints as well as massaging the various organs, yoga ensures the optimum blood supply to various parts of the body. This helps flush out toxins from every nook and cranny and deliver nourishment through- out. This leads to benefits such as slower aging, increased energy and restored zest for life. • Excellent toning of muscles that have become flac- cid or weak. The repetitive stimulation and stretch- ing sheds excess flab and creates tight, lean muscles. REBOUNDING Along with walking and yoga, rebounding is another form of body movement that receives my enthusiastic stamp of approval. You can practice this highly effective activity several times a day while watching television, listening to music or even talking on the phone. When you jump on a rebounder, or mini-trampoline, the body is subjected to gravitational pulls, but unlike jog- ging on a hard surface, rebounding does not put any stress on your joints, knees or ankles. The jumping motion stim- ulates the internal organs, moves the cerebral-spinal fluid and is very beneficial for the intestines. All cells of the body become stronger in response to the motion of re- bounding. The body's immune cells also become much 1 51"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"RAW FOOD CLEANSE more active, which gives them added ability to destroy viruses, bacteria and even cancer cells. Who wouldn't want to engage in a motion that directly strengthens the immune system? Rebounding reduces body fat, which is highly benefi- cial in treating diabetes and many other diseases. It also provides an aerobic effect, strengthening your heart and giving your body energy when you're weary. Along with deep breathing, walking and yoga, re- bounding is an excellent way to reduce stress. I've even found myself in a trance-like state from the relaxation of the repetitive jumping, which soothes the nervous system, giving you a relaxed disposition even after you've stepped off the trampoline. The overall effect is increased resistance to environmental, physical and emotional stress. Rebound- ing is recommended to those who are suffering with emo- tional issues and depression. Ultimately, it's up to you what form of body move- ment you choose. What's most important is that you find a practice that is enjoyable to you and that you can easily incorporate into your daily schedule. Many people enjoy running, swimming, hiking, biking, dancing or playing group sports like soccer, basketball or tennis. It is strictly up to you, but please understand that body movement is an integral part of living your best life now. Elimination Another aspect of achieving and maintaining your most vibrant health is paying attention to your elimination. I am always amazed when people tell me that they consider themselves to be regular when they only have a few bowel movements per week. As you become more in tune with your body, pay attention to what your elimination cycle is 152"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Life Practices for Ageless Health like, recognizing that you should be having at least one large bowel movement per day, but ultimately working toward eliminating after each meal. If you aren't seeing approximately 18 inches of fecal matter daily, then you are likely dealing with constipation and a higher level of auto-toxicity. I know, I know this subject may be taboo, but I can't in good faith write a health-related book without discussing the importance of proper elimination. I recommend educating yourself re- garding ways to facilitate proper bowel cleansing to help you achieve your best health ever. I could seriously write an entire book on this topic, but for now I will simply tell you to consider using herbal teas, enemas and colonic irrigation as part of your cleansing, healing, and weight-loss journey. If you are eating a high- raw-food diet, engaging in regular body movement, and finding ways to reduce stress, you should begin to see a dramatic improvement in your bowel pattern. Skin Care Many of us who have struggled with weight-related issues have also suffered from a lack of self-love. One practical way to reverse this unhealthy pattern is to nurture your body, which has been given to you as a gift. Take a bit of time each day to care for your skin. It's really quite simple and not very time-consuming to cultivate a daily skin-care ritual that will keep you looking and feeling your best well into your advanced years. Two things I do religiously are dry-skin-brush before I shower and then apply coconut oil as a moisturizer over my entire body. First let's look at the amazing benefits of dry skin brushing. 153"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"RAW FOOD CLEANSE DRY SKIN BRUSHING • Dry skin brushing helps you shed dead skin cells, which can improve skin texture and promote cell renewal. • Dry skin brushing increases circulation, encourag- ing your body's discharge of metabolic wastes, which greatly aids lymphatic drainage. • Dry skin brushing helps to tighten the skin because it increases the flow of blood. Increasing the cir- culation to the skin can also lessen the appearance of cellulite. • Dry skin brushing stimulates the lymph canals to drain toxic mucoid matter into the colon, thereby purifying the entire system. This enables the lymph to perform its house-cleaning duties: keeping the blood and other vital tissues detoxified. After sev- eral days of dry brushing, you may notice the mucous material in your stools. • Dry skin brushing helps with muscle tone and more even distribution of fat deposits. • Dry skin brushing rejuvenates the nervous system by stimulating nerve endings in the skin. • Dry skin brushing helps your skin absorb nutrients by eliminating clogged pores. Healthy, breathing skin contributes to overall body health. Individuals who sit at a computer screen all day long will particularly take pleasure in the benefits of skin brushing. People who have inactive lifestyles or desk jobs usually ex- perience stiff necks and shoulders, and soreness that reaches even into their arms, down their spines and into their lower backs. Increased blood flow begins entering the areas brushed and you will experience an increase in elec- tromagnetic energy that permits you to feel invigorated. 154"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Life Practices for Ageless Health MOISTURIZE & PROTECT Pure coconut oil is the finest natural skin moisturizer available. It leaves your skin soft and smooth with a healthy, youthful appearance. Its unique molecular struc- ture allows it to be easily absorbed by your skin. Because it is absorbed into the cell structure of the skin, it can help protect against excessive damage from the sun. Coconut oil will keep the connective tissues in your skin strong and supple. The natural antioxidants found in coconut oil fight against free radicals that damage connective tissue and cause the skin to lose elasticity and form wrinkles. Coconut oil also has natural antibacterial, antifungal and antimicrobial properties that provide a protective layer on your skin and can help facilitate healing of skin conditions such as rashes, acne and infections. Coconut oil contains medium-chain triglycerides, which are broken down by the good bacteria on the skin into free fatty acids. These acids in turn contribute to the acidic environment on the skin, enabling it to repel disease-causing germs. Sunlight The benefits of getting out into the sun have been nearly forgotten by a generation that now considers sunbathing totally taboo. There is truth that damage can be caused by staying too long in intense sunlight, increasing the risk of skin cancer, but conversely, safe sun exposure has been shown to help improve a host of chronic skin conditions including acne, eczema and psoriasis. Being in the sun- shine helps build strong bones and teeth, lower choles- terol, prevent heart disease and ward off depression. And even more encouraging, many health experts believe that safe exposure to sunshine may prevent more cancers than it causes. 155"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"RAW FOOD CLEANSE Sunlight triggers the body to build its own vitamin D, which is crucial not only for strong bones and healthy teeth, but for keeping the immune system fine-tuned as well. Studies have shown that exposing the body to sun- light increases the number of white blood cells or lympho- cytes. These are the body's primary defense against the assault of an infection and are a significant part of your immune response to the organisms that cause illness. Vitamin D also plays a role in increasing the amount of oxygen your blood transports around the body, which boosts energy levels, sharpens your mental faculties and gives you an improved feeling of well-being. In the early 1990s, doctors who reviewed all the med- ical literature examining the health risks of exposure to the sun concluded that the benefits of moderate exposure out- weigh both the risk of skin cancer and premature aging. Their paper, \"Beneficial Effects of Sun Exposure on Cancer Mortality,\" was published in Preventive Medicine and re- ported that safe sunbathing would slash the number of deaths from breast and colon cancers in America by a third. Although it's referred to as a vitamin, Dis not really a vitamin at all but a hormone-like substance that the body can only make when it gets enough sunlight. Since 90 per- cent of westerners now spend 90 percent of their waking time indoors, the majority of people do not get enough exposure to sunlight to make enough vitamin D. The FDA says we need 400 IU (10 meg) of vitamin D a day to stop the body from leaching calcium from the bones. Sunlight also triggers the increased production of the feel-good brain chemical serotonin-which, as well as con- trolling your sleep patterns, body temperature, and sex drive, lifts your mood and helps ward off depression. 156"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Life Practices for Ageless Health Just 20 minutes of safe sunbathing a day is enough to get the exposure you need. lhe safest way to benefit from the healing powers of sunlight is to increase your exposure slowly throughout the year and to avoid burning by stay- ing in the shade when the sun is at its most intense. To sunbathe safely, remember that frequent, short exposures are not only safer but more beneficial than an extended dose of sunlight. Also, early morning sunshine has been identified as the most beneficial. Sleep In the early 1900s, the average American slept 9.5 hours nightly. In 1975 that number had decreased to 7.5 hours. Now it has dropped to under 7 hours. Sixty-seven percent of Americans have sleep disorders, a 33 percent increase in the last five years. Seventy million Americans suffer from insomnia, and over 100 million Americans fail to get an adequate night's rest. When people get less than 6 to 7 hours of sleep each night, their risk for developing dis- eases begins to increase. The importance of getting quality sleep every night is downplayed in our super busy, late-night culture. Going to sleep before midnight is almost unheard of by a large majority of the population, yet our immune system func- tions optimally if we go to sleep by 10 p.m. As we sleep, physical repair takes place between approximately 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. Our immune cells patrol our bodies, eliminating cancer cells, bacteria, viruses, and other harmful agents. Then from about 2 a.m. to 6 a.m., we enter a stage of psy- chic regeneration. During this time, the brain releases chemicals that enhance our immune system. Throughout the night, we experience rapid eye movement (REM) sleep 157"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"RAW FOOD CLEANSE states and non-REM sleep, alternating between light sleep and deep dream states. This is how we process the mental and emotional events of the previous day and restore our minds for the day ahead. Most people need a minimum of seven or eight hours of sleep to accomplish these tasks. Without adequate sleep, the immune system is hard-pressed to keep up with its damage control. This creates the opportunity for disease to take hold. Additionally, if cortisol is elevated at night, which can happen if you are anxious, these immune func- tions can become compromised, which eventually leads to weight gain, illness and disease. Here is a list of reasons sufficient sleep is so critical for sustained weight loss and vital for you if you're to find your own optimum health: SLEEP KEEPS YOUR HEART HEALTHY Heart attacks and strokes are more common during the early morning hours. This fact may be explained by the way sleep affects the blood vessels. Lack of sleep is associated with the in- crease of blood pressure and cholesterol, both risk factors for heart disease and stroke. Your heart will be healthier if you get between 7 and 9 hours of sleep each night. SLEEP MAY HELP PREVENT CANCER Those who work the late shift have a higher risk for breast and colon cancer. Researchers believe this is caused by differing lev- els of melatonin in people who are exposed to light at night. Light exposure reduces the level of melatonin, a hormone that both makes us sleepy and is thought to pro- tect against cancer. Melatonin appears to suppress the growth of tumors. Be sure that your bedroom is dark to help your body produce the melatonin it needs. SLEEP REDUCES STRESS If your body is sleep defi- cient, it goes into a state of stress. The body's functions are put on high alert, which causes an increase in blood pres- 158"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Life Practices for Ageless Health sure and the production of stress hormones. Higher blood pressure increases your risk for heart attacks and strokes. The stress hormones also, unfortunately, make it harder for you to sleep. SLEEP REDUCES INFLAMMATION An increase in stress hormones raises the level of inflammation in your body, which creates more risk for heart conditions, cancer and diabetes. Inflammation is thought to be one of the causes of the deterioration of your body as you age. SLEEP MAKES YOU MORE ALERT Of course, a good night's sleep makes you feel energized and alert the next day. Being plugged in and active not only feels great, it also increases your chances for another good night's sleep. When you wake up feeling refreshed, you feel like going out into the day, being active and engaged in your world. You'll sleep better the next night and increase your daily energy level. SLEEP BOLSTERS YOUR MEMORY It's not fully known why we sleep and dream, but a process called memory consolidation occurs during sleep. While your body may be resting, your brain is busy processing your day, making connections between experiences, sensory input, feelings and memories. Your dreams and deep sleep are an important time for your brain to make memories and links. Getting more quality sleep will help you remember and process things better. SLEEP MAY HELP YOU LOSE WEIGHT Researchers have also found that people who sleep less than seven hours per night are more likely to be overweight or obese. It is thought that the lack of sleep impacts the balance of hormones in the body that affect appetite. The hormones ghrelin and leptin, important for the regulation of appetite, have been found to be disrupted by lack of sleep. 159"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"RAW FOOD CLEANSE SLEEP MAY REDUCE YOUR RISK FOR DEPRESSION Sleep impacts many of the chemicals in your body, includ- ing serotonin. People with a deficiency in serotonin are more likely to suffer from depression. You can help to pre- vent depression by making sure you are getting the right amount of sleep, between 7 and 9 hours each night. SLEEP HELPS THE BODY MAKE REPAIRS Sleep is a time for your body to repair damage caused by stress, ultraviolet rays and other harmful exposures. Your cells produce more protein while you are sleeping. lhese pro- tein molecules form the building blocks for cells, allowing them to repair damage. Feeding the Spirit For me, one of the most powerful aspects of my total health journey has been \"to be still and know the voice of God\" and to learn about my purpose in this life and how to flourish in that purpose. Choosing to live a life that includes prayer and meditation helps connect you to a lis- tening God. As you begin to listen to that still, small voice within, you naturally start gravitating toward fulfilling your purpose on this planet, becoming transformed more each day into the person you were created to be. \"Spirituality is an essential dimension of being hu- man, and as much a part of us as our bodies and minds/' shares Jonathan Ellerby, PhD, author of Return to the Sacred. \"It's not a matter of whether or not you're spiritual, but of what kind of spiritual personality you have.\" I rec- ommend Ellerby's book as a helpful starting place if you feel detached from your spirituality. I have seen that in the place of the Spirit, all things become possible; healing and weight loss can occur no 160"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Life Practices for Ageless Health matter how severe or long-standing the situation. This is the place of miracles, where the body does what it was designed to do-heal. Just as a cut naturally heals in time, without thought, without action, without any effort, so can disease heal when all the blockages, imbalances, and tox- ins have been released from body, mind, and emotions. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF PRAYER/MEDITATION/STILLNESS Prayer is the simple act of communicating or communing with God. Most of your time in communion can be spent listening to the voice spoken into your heart. Holy scrip- tures teach that you can begin to clearly know God's voice rather than the voice of your mind, your emotions, or the world system when you begin to seek Him with all of your heart. For me, this happened when I recognized the end of my own ideas, strength and ability to change. As I became humbled and still, in a place of fasting and prayer, the direction and empowerment for change started to happen. Even if you don't consider yourself to be a spiritual or religious person, there is much research that shows prayer and meditation to be hugely beneficial in overcoming life's most stubborn challenges, like disease and obesity. Here are some statistics: • Many physicians recommend meditation to prevent and control pain in patients suffering from chronic illnesses or conditions such as heart disease, AIDS, cancer and infertility. • Prayer can restore balance to those afflicted with mental conditions such as depression, hyperactivity and attention deficit disorder (ADD). • For 30 years, medical research has shown that prayer can reduce emotional stress. 161"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"RAW FOOD CLEANSE • Prayer can \"reset'' the brain to change behavior (for example, reducing one's tendency toward road rage). • Those who pray are generally healthier and live longer. They have lower blood pressure and lower incidence of stroke and heart disease. They are less likely to smoke or drink and tend to get sick less often. • The authors of the Handbook af Religion and Health document nearly 1,200 studies done on the effects of prayer on health. Here are some of those statistics: • Hospitalized people who never attended church have an average stay that is three times longer than people who attended regularly. • Heart patients were 14 times more likely to die following surgery if they did not participate in a religion. • Elderly people who never or rarely attended church had a stroke rate double that of people who attended regularly. • In Israel, religious people had a 40 percent lower death rate from cardiovascular disease and cancer. The author of The Blue Zones, Dan Buettner, writes: \"The simple act of regularly attending a religious service or ceremony seems to be a common thread among cul- tures with the longest life spans. It doesn't matter what your faith practice is-attending a religious service-even once a month, seems to have positive effects on overall health and happiness. A study in the Journal of Health and Social Behavior followed over 2,500 people for seven and a half years and discovered that those who attended regular religious services (one to three times per month) had a longer life expectancy than those who did not.\" 162"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"Life Practices for Ageless Health All of this comes as no surprise to those who have an active faith, but for those who do not, perhaps these facts will open you up to considering your own spirituality, not as just a concept, something on paper, or a religious myth, but as real. When God becomes real for you, life is never the same again and prayer is not a waste of time, but a fountain of new life. To begin, the practice of meditative prayer should last for at least 15 minutes each day, as it's hard to quiet the mind and body in less than that amount of time. Praying with a spiritual book or with scriptures can be very help- ful. Finding a quiet place where you can be alone and un- distracted by noise or cell phones is key. Begin by asking God, as you know him, to help you focus during this time of prayer. God has no problem being with us, although we often have the problem of being distant from God. Be quiet for a few moments to listen and think about God. Think about whom you are addressing. Dwell on this thought for a while. If you have a good imagination, visu- alize being in His presence: imagine the two of you talking and walking together. Imagine him touching you gently, smiling and saying, \"Peace be with you.\" What is happen- ing inside you? How are you feeling? Allow forgiveness and love to flow over and through you at this time. Because so many of us have been wounded by reli- gion, its people and its dogmas, this exercise is a meaning- ful way to reconnect with our own spirituality in a per- sonal and intimate way. There is much healing and freedom in this practice. During these precious times of spiritual awakening, you can start to believe that it is God's perfect will for you to be made who lei all you have to do is receive. 163"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"RAW FOOD CLEANSE Community A support group can be a great resource for people with health issues and for those who are hoping to lose weight permanently. This is likely the reason that Weight Watch- ers has been the world's most successful approach to last- ing weight loss. The emotional support and encourage- ment of like-minded people can be so significant when trying to achieve your best health ever. Look for opportu- nities to join raw food groups in your area or online groups that will allow you to share your achievements, recipes, ideas and even your challenges. The camaraderie of others who have the same goal can help you avoid pitfalls such as emotional eating and bingeing. (In the Resource section at the back of this book,. you'll find infor- mation on a suggested web-based community of support for raw foodists.) Finding new healthy relationships, either online or in person, will help you with challenges such as remaining accountable, staying within your dietary budget, overcom- ing cravings and getting past plateaus. Whenever you want to share tips, get support or simply chat about weight- and health-related challenges and successes, this type of com- munity can provide an outlet for you. When I decided to write this book,. I created an online research group to help collect data for my writing. I had no way of knowing that this online community would evolve into something so beneficial for both the research project and for all of those who participated.

Jen Hoppa attended as a guest of one of my closest friends. I had met Jen a couple of times before at local raw food events. When I shared with the dinner guests that I had been commissioned to write a book outlining four specific raw food cleanses for individuals wanting to restore their health and lose weight, Jen quickly offered to 166"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"Real Stories from Raw Food Superheroes be a guinea pig for my cleanse research. In addition to being a longtime vegetarian and vibrant new-experience seeker, Jen had a bit of weight she wanted to lose, so she was instantly motivated to try the program. That night over dinner-party conversation, I realized others around the globe might also like to be part of the experiment. A few days later I put a video on YouTube and RawFu, a raw food social-networking site, asking for vol- unteers to participate in the research for this book. Within 24 hours, I had nearly 200 e-mails from people who hoped to be chosen for such a project. Needless to say, I was thrilled, but I was also overwhelmed. Because of the time sensitivity, I had to pick my guinea pigs immediately, as the research would need to begin in a matter of days. I had to tum away hundreds of interested project volunteers, all people just like you, eager to try anything to lose weight and find their optimal health. Over the course of the following 11 weeks, many par- ticipants became inactive or were removed from the research for a variety of reasons, but in the end, 65 partici- pants successfully completed the program. These partici- pants lost a combined total of over 900 pounds, and the individual results, which I am about to share with you, are staggering. But even more interesting, the friendships and connections that developed within the research group reveal how vital a sense of community and camaraderie can be in helping you reach your personal goals. Back to Jen: Not only did she successfully complete the 11-week Raw Food Cleanse Experiment, she also talked her very hesitant, skeptical parents into joining her. The Hoppa family's story is one that will stir, motivate and inspire you. 167"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"RAW FOOD CLEANSE The Hoppas-Bill, 52; Katy, 51; and Jen, 24 Tulsa, Oklahoma Jen made the decision to become a vegetarian at age 12, much to the dismay of her parents. They questioned her reasons for such an unexpected pronouncement and tried to convince her how difficult and complicated such a life might be at school and in social situations. Their concerns continued to grow as Jen became more determined about her decision. Where would she get her protein and ade- quate nutrition, especially when she was so young and still growing developmentally? After much debate and many long family discussions, Jen made her final choice, and she has maintained a vege- tarian lifestyle ever since. Her parents have continued to lovingly support their daughter's lifestyle choice, but they did not adopt a vegetarian diet themselves. Recently, when Jen approached them about her new raw food diet, the eyebrows raised once again. Katy shares her experience: Our daughter Jen first started incorporating raw food into her diet after joining a local group, Real Food Tulsa, which facilitates raw food potlucks and holds monthly meetings on the lifestyle. Even though she was only getting her feet wet with this way of eating, I began seeing amazing results in her within a short period of time. I have never been a vegetable eater, and the thought of eating raw vegetables was less than appealing to me. Months later, Jen told me that she was embarking on another, more intense raw-food diet, but this time as an experiment for a friend who was writing a book on the subject. For some reason, I listened with more interest. 168"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"Real Stories from Raw Food Superheroes I was quickly approaching menopause and had gained 40 pounds over the last three years. Nothing I did seemed to get the weight off. As the Raw Food Cleanse Experiment kickoff date grew closer, I wondered if I could possibly eat a raw food diet. As a last-minute whim-and I do mean last-minute-my husband and I decided to support Jen and committed to try to eat raw foods for three days. I thought that if Bill and I could just lose a few pounds and feel a bit better it might be worth the hell we were sure to experience. After only three days of 100 percent raw eating, I was hooked. Daily I made one of Penni's cleansing smoothies with chia seeds, coconut oil and lots of greens and fruit. Green Smoothies usually made up two meals of our day, but we ate snacks of highly nutritious foods and a raw evening meal. For the first time in my life I was never hungry. Sugar, carb and chocolate cravings were gone. Since we began eating this way, our lives have been revolutionized by a raw food diet. We are eating the best food of our lives and living our best life ever. Katy Hoppa lost 25 pounds in 10 weeks. In her final evalu- ation, she shares that her overall health has greatly improved, her energy level has greatly increased, she feels more balanced in her emotions and has had a clearing of long-term \"brain fog.\" Other improvements include smoother, clearer, glowing skin, stronger nails and de- creased hair loss. She was also motivated to add walking to her daily health regime. Finally, Katy adds: I now see my high-raw-foods diet as a lifestyle that I will carry throughout my entire life. A very close friend who is a medical doctor asked me one question after learning that I had begun a 100 percent raw food diet 169"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"RAW FOOD CLEANSE \"Can you eat this way forever?\" He said he always asks this question of his patients when they talk about diets and losing weight. He asked this during my first week of eating raw and my answer was \"Let's wait and see.\" Now, after 11 weeks, my answer is unequivocally, ''YES!\" Katy' s husband, Bill, also had a dramatic experience with the Raw Food Cleanse. At 52 years old, 5'7\" and 235 pounds, Bill was hesitant about this way of eating, yet he too was ready for a change. At the beginning of the exper- iment, he viewed eating a raw food diet as extreme and \"counter-cultural,\" certainly not something one could real- istically maintain for any length of time. Read along as Bill shares his experiences: The past 10 weeks have been such a positive experience because of the absence of cravings. Both weight loss and the overall health benefits such as lowered blood pressure, tighter, firmer skin, more energy, strength, endurance and improved concentration were noticeable in a short amount of time. It just seemed that these improvements were automatic benefits that simply happened by themselves as a result of the lifestyle change. Every other diet I had tried in the past gave me a sense of being on a temporary, deprivation-oriented, unnatural, forced way of eating. This has been one of the top five most transformational experiences of my life! For the first time since emerging from my mother's womb, I am not preoccupied and controlled by food: hunge~ cravings, addictions, and all the other horrible consequences of the standard American diet. I thought people who ate this way were unnecessarily fanatical and misinformed. Through personal education and experience, my eyes 170"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Real Stories from Raw Food Superheroes have been opened and my life has been transformed. I can now see, taste and feel the positive difference in real, whole, natural, organic and raw foods. In the past, every moment was focused on when I would enjoy my next morsel. Now I use every morsel to enhance my ability to enjoy my next moment. Tectonic plates have shifted: I now eat to live rather than live to eat. Since Katy, Jen and I did this experiment as a team, it has brought us closer together as a family. The outcome of this bonding experience is equally as significant as the 32 pounds I lost in the process. Now my primary concern is relationship rather than food. One of my new life missions is to bring raw food to real people. Of course by now you must be wondering what happened with Jen. Even though Jen had been a vegetarian for over half her life, that didn't mean she kept a meticulously healthy watch over everything she ate. As many know, it's possible to be a vegetarian and still not be totally healthy. Here are some of her observations from the experiment: Prior to trying the Raw Food Cleanse, I was taking a lot of naps and feeling generally sluggish. I would get tired at work, which would affect my performance and dampen my mood. Since I started eating a very high raw foods diet, I now have improved clarity and focus. Although I was not taking it regularly, I did have a prescription for Adderall to help with my ADD tendencies. This way of eating helped me to focus with more intent and motivation. I think I've taken one nap in the past three months. I also sleep better and feel more rejuvenated after sleeping than I did before. Another benefit was an improvement in bowel function. I've generally never had a lot of BMs, having one or none at all per day. This has always bothered me 171"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"RAW FOOD CLEANSE and although I've tried \"increasing my fiber'' many a time, I've never had changed results. Eating a high raw diet increased my BMs to a comfortable level of regularity that I hadn't experienced before. It has helped me to feel much lighter and more \"clean.\" I think the 80 I 20 model is ideal for my body and perfect for dealing with cravings, social events and traveling. If you try to do 100 percent raw all the time, then any slip-up is interpreted as a failure. But with the 80 I 20 diet, if you end up only eating 80 percent raw one day, there is no guilt. If you eat more than 80 percent raw, there is a feeling of accomplishment. The 80 I 20 model is really helpful for long-term success. If something is not attainable, people will not do it. I feel so amazing after eating a high-raw diet, there is no way I'm going to let myself relapse back into a world of fatigue and poor health. I want raw to be a lifestyle for me. I see it as the perfect way to maintain my weight loss. Jen lost 14 pounds during the 11 weeks that she partici- pated in the research experiment. The Hoppas continue to maintain this healthy way of eating along with following many of the Life Practices for Ageless Health (see Chapter 7). Jen is maintaining her weight loss and Bill and Katy continue to lose weight toward their goals. Dawn Maiorana, 42 Pleasant Valley, New York Since making the decision to eat a high raw diet, including Green Smoothies and juicing, I feel like I've taken my body and my life back.

Anna H., 35 Barrie, Ontario I've always struggled with my health. As a child, I generally spent one to two weeks in the hospital every year with pneumonia, tonsillitis or a horrible bout of the flu. I've also been challenged with a few autoimmune disorders. I added to the complexity of my compromised constitution by taking up a few destructive habits in my early adult years, like smoking, caffeine consumption, undereating, overeating or just eating poorly, not getting enough sleep, and burning the candle at both ends. Over time, the cumulative effects of my challenged health and lifestyle choices caught up with me and it became clear that I had to make some serious changes. Food seemed to be the most obvious aspect to change, so I started there. However, it wasn't easy and it didn't just happen overnight. When you start caring about what you eat, it's an act of self-love and self- preservation, which ultimately spills over into other areas of your life. Changing my diet has not only helped me to lose 12 pounds so f~ it has also brought such relief. I now feel as if I have found real answers and a way out of the vicious cycle I was in. Not only has my 173"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"RAW FOOD CLEANSE physical health improved, but my mental well-being has been greatly enhanced as well.

My husband has started asking me questions about his health and has finally agreed to go in for his first ever physical. I hosted a dinner party for all of my friends that included a number of raw food dishes, and they were amazed at how delicious everything was. I hope to continue to be an ambassador of positive change within my sphere of influence, sharing the message of how foods affect your health and healing. Barbara, 45 Silver Spring, Maryland 1he Raw Food Cleanse has brought so many positive changes into my life. Saying goodbye to dairy products and gluten-containing foods has been a huge aspect of my restored health. No more gas or bloating, yea! Also, my blood pressure went from being borderline to being well within the normal range. Incorporating more raw foods into my diet has helped me to love myself more, putting me in closer touch with the world around me. 1hey say you are what you eat, and I believe that is so true. Before I learned about raw foods, I was rushed, always choosing packaged foods that were full of artificial ingredients. Now I appreciate nature's bounty and find joy in something as simple as a fresh tomato! Every time I choose to eat raw, I'm deciding to be kind to my body. 1his is a huge breakthrough.

I have always been a lurker type, but in this group and with this experiment, I have really put myself out there in ways I never thought were possible for me. Eating a raw food diet, being part of all the honesty and watching the personal videos from others has given me a new confidence in myself. I now perceive myself as someone others would want to talk to, know or look at, and it's not just about the 10 pounds I lost. It amazes me that this kind of transformation can happen in a person's life both inside and out just by eating living foods! My results were so quick, too.

Afsheen Mayhai, 23, and Hannah Mayhai, 25 (husband and wife) Burlington, Iowa Hannah said: It is through raw food that I've finally started to get my life back. I had a baby 18 months ago and the postpartum depression and weight gain really affected me. I had never been over 200 pounds before, and by the time I found the Raw Food Cleanse opportunity I was pushing 250 pounds.

Andrea Crossman, 38 Brooklyn, New York 1his group was heaven sent. As a holistic nurse and cofounder of a love-infused social entrepreneurship venture called Lovemore, I was deeply bothered when I began to realize that I was not in alignment with my own mantra, \"love more,\" in some fundamental ways. I had stopped the exercise I loved, put back on 40 pounds that I was oh-so-proud to have lost a few years ago, and my social life had all but ground to a halt as I struggled with not feeling right in my skin or in my spirit. It was in that place that I stumbled upon Penni's open call for guinea pigs. Serendipity like this is not to be ignored. 1his raw connection back to my soul was masterminded by the cosmos, of that I have no doubt. 1he love and support I found in the group was amazing and the accountability has been huge for me. Another critical factor in my success was that I viewed this experiment as focused not on weight loss, but 176"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"Real Stories from Raw Food Superheroes actually on love and health, with weight loss as the natural outcome. 1hat mindset totally worked for me. It's so wonderful to be enjoying my food, feeling the vibrations of being well-fed and completely nourished, while still being able to eat foods I consider to be treats, and while losing weight at the same time. 1his weight- loss experiment has been a revelation for me. I don't feel deprived-with the sense of orneriness, depression or wanting to act out that comes along with deprivation. In fact, I actually feel very well-loved as a result of getting to have all of these beautiful, fresh, delicious foods in abundance every day. Andrea lost nearly 30 pounds during our Raw Food Oeanse Experiment and her delightful presence made us all feel loved more. Debbie Dise, 54 Tahlequah, Oklahoma 1hirty years ago I was introduced to raw foods by Ann Wigmore. 1he information in her books just made sense to me and changed my life for the better. I grew indoor greens and made Rejuvelac and could f eel how important live enzyme-enriched foods were for my body. I went on to become a licensed midwife and saw how important good nutrition was for pregnant moms and their growing babies. Some of the healthiest moms and babies I helped birth were high-raw vegan families. I went on to get my license as a body worker and colon hydrotherapist and started learning a lot about degener- ative diseases and how the standard American diet was contributing to mass amounts of pain and suffering.

Joint pain and gallbladder pain of eight-plus years was gone. I was also amazed to get my metabolism back up and running without the use of unhealthy exercise stimulants!

It's been so interesting because I considered myself to be fairly healthy before I started this cleanse. However, as I began eating more and more raw foods, some of the things I considered to be normal about myself started to disappear. For example, I thought it was normal to have itchy skin. When I realized that I had been creating the itchiness with my diet, I was stunned. My skin cleared up, my acid reflux went away, the pain in my knees reduced and my hair and nails grew longer and more luxurious. How powerful is that? During the experiment I chose to do water and juice feasting, which helped me get over my fear of not snacking. I had always thought that I had low blood sugar because I had to eat every two or three hours so I wouldn't get lightheaded or run down. I believed this about myself because I grew up hearing my mom always saying that about herself. I didn't realize it before, but I had actually conditioned myself to think that this was just normal and \"this is just how I am.\" Now I can go for many hours between meals and be just fine. Doing the water /juice fasts has been such a powerful revelation for me because now I know I'll be fine to just wait until I can have some fruit or veggies. I don't have to feed my body junk out of unfounded panic. Even though my husband's not raw, or vegan or even a vegetarian, he is still totally supportive of me. I will definitely continue to eat a high raw diet. Even though I lost 14 pounds, it's not about the weight loss for me, this is now my lifestyle and I don't see that ever changing.

I'm only 44! I'd wake up in the middle of the night all sweaty, or during the day, just out of nowhere I'd get really hot. Not pleasant at all! About three weeks into this experiment I stopped having hot flashes altogether.

I lost 13 pounds and 22 inches and know that raw (80 percent) is the way to go for me. I have dabbled on and off for a couple of years and cannot tell you how much better I feel on raw than off. If I can just keep all of this in mind, I will never be tempted to stray far from raw. Kerry, 40 Salem, Oregon I've struggled with fibromyalgia for over 15 years, and since I started eating raw last January, my muscle soreness is much improved. I'm convinced that my body is putting all this newfound energy into helping me feel better. Speaking of energy, I've earned the reputation now as the Energizer bunny because I just keep going and going. It must be all the raw foods that have me so powered up! Since I've been on the Raw Food Cleanse I've dropped eight pounds and my ulcerative colitis has gone bye-bye!

My diet consisted of only about 25 percent raw foods when I began this experiment. I thought that what I was eating was healthy, but now I realize it wasn't all that great. Because I have hypothyroidism, it has been a battle to lose weight, no matter what or how hard I tried. On most diets I would actually gain weight. With the Raw Food Cleanse, the nearly 20-pound weight loss was painless. I have not been starving myself and the weight is just falling off. This experience has been such a blessing. I will certainly continue to follow this dietary lifestyle because it's easy and I really feel great. Aimee K., 39 Lewisburg, Pennsylvania I completely understand why people might be put off at first by the idea of eating raw. For most of us who grew up on TV dinners, white bread and fast food, eating raw seems like a completely foreign concept, when in fact it is the oldest and most natural way to eat. My introduction to raw foods came years ago while living in California. Only 25 years old at the time, I was still living the party life when I took a job as a server at a raw food restaurant called Garden Taste. Unfortunately I missed the call and didn't feel a need to make any changes to my then standard American diet, but thankfully, a seed had been planted. Ten years later when I was living in Oregon, my concern for the environment led me to join a group called the Northwest Earth Institute, a grassroots organization with programs emphasizing individual responsibility in adopting a more sustainable lifestyle. There I learned the benefits of eating organic, seasonal and locally grown foods. This new knowledge, coupled 183"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"RAW FOOD CLEANSE with the fact that I was becoming a first-time mom, led me to begin making healthier food choices, though my diet still consisted of mostly cooked foods, including meats. After my son's birth, I fell into the common trap of thinking being a \"good mother\" meant sacrificing my own needs. So, while I focused a lot of my energy on making sure my son got the best nutrition possible, I failed to make my own health a priority. In two years, I gained over 50 pounds and acquired a long list of aches, pains and inflammatory problems. When my health issues began noticeably interfering with my life, I knew I needed to change. Innately I felt that the best path to optimal health and wellness for me was to add more living foods to my diet. While I dabbled in eating raw a few times in recent months, I lacked direction and needed help transitioning. Then, as fate would have it, I was given the opportunity to be a guinea pig in the Raw Food Cleanse. Penni's guidance has made a huge difference in my life. Just the simple act of beginning my day with 32 ounces of pure, alkaline, mineral-rich water helped me shift away from my habit of getting up in the morning and immediately doing for others. It's a gift I now give myself each morning. Although I was not one of the biggest weight-loss stories within the group, I noticed tremendous positive changes within weeks of converting to a high-raw diet. Most of my ailments are now gone or drastically improved, my skin is glowing, my overall mood is brighter and my confidence greater. There is no doubt that I will continue to eat this way, for myself and for the planet. 184"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"Real Stories from Raw Food Superheroes Jodi Clark, 44 La Quinta, California Although there is certainly a learning curve when it comes to transitioning from a typical American diet to one that is high in raw foods, I found the education and community support invaluable as I participated in the Raw Food Oeanse Experiment. Within just a couple of weeks, eating this new way became easier and I could actually feel the difference. I no longer crave junk food or sweets and my taste for animal protein has diminished almost entirely. I look forward to my meals and see them as a true source of life and energy for my body. I'm thrilled to have lost 14 pounds during the experiment, but am even more encouraged that my gallbladder symptoms are completely gone. My chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia pains decreased and my mental clarity improved dramatically. All previous symptoms of PMS, cramps, bloating, breast tenderness, extreme fatigue and nausea are gone. I view this as only the beginning of my newfound life. Eating this way will certainly be a lifestyle choice from now on. Wendy Agee, 34 Mentor, Ohio Even though Wendy had already embraced a raw foods lifestyle before joining our research group, she made a more intense commitment during the 11-week experiment. She upped her daily intake from about 75 percent to 90 percent raw and she added regular walking and biking to her routine. Wendy was able to get below 200 pounds for the first time in years, losing 15 pounds and 12 inches. Being a raw foodist is just who Wendy is at this pointj there is no turning back now! 185"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"RAW FOOD CLEANSE Aimee Bittinger, 30 Seattle, Washington Since I started the Raw Food Cleanse, people say I look better and less tired, and I agree. Even though I was eating raw before the cleanse, I tried some new approaches like juice fasting. I was really intimidated by the idea, but upon hearing other people's stories and having Penni's support, I embarked on the five days recommended. It was not easy for me. I've given up many foods in my life, and it's never been easy, but giving up all food for even a short while was really a hard concept for me. Within a short time I began to realize my emotional attachment to food. Since I've had food allergies and restrictions for over 10 years, I've always been worried if I didn't eat enough I might starve. Through juicing, I realized I can survive with less and learn to appreciate what I have! After my juice feast, people commented on my skin being smoother and softer and my eyes being clearer. The number-one best change that I implemented during the 11 weeks was drinking 32 ounces of water first thing every morning. It helped me so much, and I plan to keep this as a habit for life. On this cleanse, I gained lots of information and skills that I will continue to use. I will continue to eat a mostly raw diet. It seems like the perfect way to maintain weight and to be healthier overall. Anita Repp, 63 Tulsa, Oklahoma I doubled my raw food percentage during the Raw Food Cleanse Experiment. I noticed that eating this way brought an enormous amount of mental clarity after I got my system cleansed from sugar and processed 186"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Real Stories from Raw Food Superheroes foods. I plan to continue to eat a higher, healthier level of raw foods, eliminating those foods that I know don't encourage health or add longevity to my life. T. Larson, 47 Moorhead, Minnesota Before I started eating a raw foods diet I had a multitude of ailments. Nothing specifically life- threatening, but I had irritable bowel syndrome, acne, dry skin, allergies, migraines, PMS, borderline obsessive-compulsive disorder, an ulcer since I was 13, arthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome ... and probably more things that I am forgetting now because they are gone. Since changing my diet, I have not had to take medication for anything. As long as I stay raw, the PMS and allergies are kept at bay. My bottle of ulcer medication has collected much dust. I sleep more soundly and wake more rested even on less sleep. Acne and dry skin patches only start to reappear if I return to my old patterns of eating. Being 47 years old, I was starting to see gross granny skin on my feet, elbows and knees-you know the chicken skin I'm referring to. All of that is gone, and without having to slather on lotions or creams. I've also lost the jaw jowls and gobbler neck that come with aging. My outlook on life is more positive and I react more positively even if something negative is happening around me. Over time, I know that eating a raw foods diet will help me live a long, healthy and productive life without all of the ailments I had while eating a standard American diet. If you think eating a raw diet is time-consuming, inconvenient or even too tedious, I would like you to compare that little bit of additional effort to the 187"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"RAW FOOD CLEANSE experience of being on lifelong medications, or even dying, from the results of cancer or some other degenerative condition. Personally, I'd rather spend two days each month making delicious raw tortilla chips, drying fruit or preparing other foods than spend weeks, months or years in a hospital bed unable to do anything but wait to die. I guess I don't need to tell you that I plan to make this a long-term lifestyle. Eating raw, along with body movement and meditation, is the way for me and there is no turning back. I've already cleared out my kitchen cupboards and have replaced everything. This is a lifetime commitment and I love it! Sarah Chimblo, 35 Jenks, Oklahoma As a mother of two and a teacher, I know the importance of eating raw foods for health. After the birth of my second child, I noticed that the last 15 pounds of pregnancy weight wasn't coming off as easily as it had the first time, eight years ago. So I started researching healthier food habits and came across the raw food lifestyle via Penni's blog, which was recommended by my sister-in-law. I decided to try the Raw Food Cleanse as a way to get my eating under control and to rethink how and what I was eating. I did the three-day cleanse to begin with and experienced some of the symptoms of detox. I had the chills, a little more acne than usual and a runny nose. 1hose symptoms subsided as I continued eating raw after the cleanse. For one week during the experiment, I really focused on eating totally raw, and I exercised. Within that week I lost six pounds. 1hat was a dress-size for me.

I've gone from about 25 percent to 60--70 percent raw during the last 11 weeks. What I've learned through this process: Be prepared. If you are a parent, you'll need to plan your meals and how you can best incorporate your foods with the family meals. Be kind to yourself. Some days all I could do was eat fruit and veggies as snacks, but then again, refer to the previous tip. Smoothies are an easy alternative when you're on the go. They're great as a meal replacement for breakfast or lunch. Green Smoothies are great for digestion. A simple combination of spinach, cucumber and apples has so many good nutrients. When I eat more raw foods, my body just feels better on less food. Participating in the Raw Food Cleanse has made me look more closely at the food I give my family. It has prompted research and led me to read many books about the food industry and how eating raw, unprocessed food really is best for my family. My goals in the future are to continue adding more fruits/ veggies to my family's diet, curb the snacking that comes from the teacher's lounge and encourage others to eat real food. Dianne, 50 Gig Harbor, Washington Dianne was already rocking a high-raw-food diet before she started the Raw Food Cleanse, but during the 11 weeks she lost weight and noticed that her skin began to clear.

Marcy Lisboa, 39 Brooklyn, New York Starting this experiment really made me look at myself more than at food. The detox we worked on hit home in more ways than one. It made me realize that my weight issues are about so much more than just what I was putting into my mouth. I have been controlling my feelings by stuffing food down. That realization was my biggest reward of this experiment and I'm so grateful for it. I learned that the past is in the past and that I am more than just a number on a scale. The scale will no longer be the measure of who I am as a person. I now have a more positive self-image and I view this is as just the beginning for me. Weight management is just a small part of what I received from this experiment. I now have a sense that I can be successful in anything I seek to do. Look for my \"full story'' in Penni's sequel to this book-I am just starting to emerge from my cocoon! Robin Abbott, 47 Little Rock, Arkansas I first learned about raw foods, juicing and smoothies last year when I read Health Bliss, by Susan Smith Jones, which introduced the concept of the raw food lifestyle. It piqued my interest and I kept thinking and thinking about it. I did more research on the internet, and I went to the library and checked out Harvey Diamond's latest 190"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Real Stories from Raw Food Superheroes book (Harvey wrote Fit For Life in the '80s). I discovered Angela Stokes on the internet and downloaded her book, Raw Emotions. I began watching her and Matt Monarch on YouTube. That's where I ran across their interview with Penni the last weekend in May. When I looked at Penni's site, she had posted an invitation to join in the Raw Food Cleanse Experiment. The timing was spot-on as the program would be starting in the next day or so. I thought about it for a short time and told my husband I wanted to do it. I told him it would take a lot of my time and energy, but I needed to do it. He was supportive, so I signed up. I had gotten up to 180 pounds last year and had lost 14 pounds January through March of this year by eating whole cooked foods and exercising, but my weight loss had stalled. I went back to my standard American diet again in March and quit working out as my energy went down. The vicious cycle had begun again. On June 1, when this experiment began, I weighed in at 167, so I was really ready for a change! Even though the changes were difficult at first, it took only a week for positive transformations to start occurring. I began feeling better and not minding the body movement or missing cooked food. After about a week, the physical food cravings subsided. I began saying positive affirmations when I was walking outside, on the treadmill, or driving. My favorite affirmation is, \"I maintain optimum health and a slim, sexy body through a diet of living and raw foods, sunshine and exercise.\" I believe that a change in mindset has had as much to do with my transformation as the raw foods and exercise. Everything seemed to be completely intertwined. Throughout this experiment, my diet mainly consisted of fresh fruit in the mornings, a Green 191"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"RAW FOOD CLEANSE Smoothie in the late morning or at lunch, or leftovers from a raw food dinner at lunch. I would enjoy a Green Juice mid-afternoon and then have a raw food dinner an hour or so later. I enjoyed trying several of the Life Cleanse recipes along with others I found on the internet or in raw food books. Without a dehydrator or high-speed blender, I had to keep things as simple as possible. I read in Tonya Zavasta's book Beautiful on Raw that transitioning to a raw food lifestyle is similar to immigrating to another country. There are many cultural activities that must be left behind. There are new friends to be made and new tastes to acquire. I still miss the ease of grabbing a quick processed meal, or going out to dinner and being waited on after a long day. But nothing compares with the improvement in health, physically, mentally and spiritually, that I have gained. I've gone from being an overweight, sluggish, perimenopausal emotional ping-pong ball with bad skin and high cholesterol, to a healthy, fit, happy and vibrant woman. Within 11 weeks I lost 23 pounds and I feel like I have my life back! I plan to maintain a high raw lifestyle for the rest of my life. I don't see any way of maintaining optimum health without eating a very high percentage of living foods, so I do plan to continue learning to prepare more raw recipes, and to get more involved in the raw food lifestyle.

Name withheld by request I began drinking alcohol on a somewhat regular basis about ten years ago. Although I gave up alcohol for Lent one year, prior to doing the Raw Food Cleanse I was drinking nearly every evening. Usually it was two or three glasses of wine, and then other times it was the whole bottle. When I would go out I'd indulge in two or three margaritas or Long Island Teas. I didn't give my ''habit\" too much concern since drinking hadn't interfered with my life to the point where I didn't meet responsibilities, and no one had ever confronted me about it. But down deep, it weighed on my mind. My brother passed away due in part to alcoholism, and both of my mother's grandfathers were alcoholics, bringing much shame to the family. When I made the decision to join the Raw Food Oeanse research group, I knew alcohol would interfere with my results, but I was concerned that I couldn't give up my evening wine. A part of me wondered if I'd become an alcoholic. I decided to not make a big deal out of it and made the decision to just go ahead and try. There was something unique about this situation that allowed me to approach things in a relaxed way, although I did feel accountable to the program and the rest of the group. It was really the perfect situation; after all, it was just an experiment. Once on a high raw foods diet, I never had physical cravings for alcohol. Giving it up was no more difficult 193"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"RAW FOOD CLEANSE than giving up the unhealthy diet I had been eating. I just toughed it out that first week and then I was completely fine. Although I never considered myself an alcoholic, I was a regular drinker. Eating a raw food diet cured my cravings for sweets, alcohol, bread and other SAD foods. Oh, and coffee, too. I didn't think this was possible! One simple thing I've done to help with cravings is drink mineral water, or even plain water with lemon or lime in a pretty wine glass. I think part of why I enjoy drinking is holding the pretty glass. Silly, I know, but it works. No doubt the change in diet and the elimination of my daily alcohol is the reason I lost so much weight in 11 weeks, including a six-and-a-half- inch loss around my belly! Melinda Gill, 38 Coquitlam, British Columbia I was already eating a pretty high-raw-foods diet when I joined the Raw Food Cleanse project. I saw this as an opportunity to turn up the volume and get serious about eating 100 percent raw for the duration of the experiment. Even though I already had experienced a marked improvement in my health since going raw, bumping it up to 100 percent brought these exciting changes: clearer skin with a definite glow, better mood, weight loss of over 14 pounds, much better elimination, able to deal with adversity bette~ and less aches and pains in general. My energy levels are great and I need much less sleep. I just do so much better at 100 percent raw.

After four years of thyroid medication adjustments and dieting (Weight Watchers, Atkins and South Beach) I finally lost 112 pounds, placing me at my goal weight of 128 pounds. I was at this weight for only three months when I got a diagnosis of adrenal failure and was put on cortisone for life. I was told I would die without it. I immediately started gaining weight (this was in 2004). Then I got very ill in 2008 with drug- induced Cushing's Syndrome (the opposite of adrenal failure). I weaned myself off the cortisone very slowly. It took five months, and I did not die. My most recent doctor believes I was misdiagnosed because the proper tests were never done. I've now been off cortisone for four months and am still healing from Cushing's Syndrome. I also have gastroparesis (gut paralysis). My entire digestive tract was not working properly from my stomach to my colon. My food would not digest and I had severe constipation. I had daily nausea and vomited several times a week. I had reflux 24/7. When what little I ate did stay down, the food would stay in my stomach for days and ferment. The bloating was unbearable. My colon barely worked and I had to take a gallon of Miralax once a week to get a weekly BM. I lost 50 pounds and suffered from malabsorption and anemia. I tried many medications, but none worked. I was told that my last resort would be a total liquid diet; if that were to fail I would need colon surgery.

I started with smoothies. I knew to get as much nourishment as I could I needed whole foods. I also bought a juicer. This was the beginning of raw for me. Within a week I no longer experienced nausea, vomiting or bloating and I didn't need any more medications to have a BM. I now go up to three times a day; apparently fiber is not an issue if it's raw. After a few weeks on smoothies I tried small amounts of fruits and did not get sick. Then I tried a few nuts and did not get sick. I was very afraid of veggies because they had made me so sick in the past. It took about a month for me to try some zucchini with a little marinara. I did not get sick. It's a total miracle that my stomach works as long as I stay raw. It's a miracle that I've lost 15 pounds in 17 days while still healing from Cushing's.

At that time I instinctively knew I had to clean up my diet. I became a vegan and immersed myself in studies of nutrition and cancer.

Ellen Morrison, 42 Honolulu, Hawaii I have realized the benefit of raw for years now but had not yet embraced the lifestyle completely. Prior to this experiment, I was eating mostly vegetarian and trying to have at least one salad per day. The biggest change that I made during the cleanse was to have a green smoothie every morning religiously. I also did yoga every single night so I was eating my heavier meal during the day and a much lighter meal in the evening. I feel like all I've learned has helped me to change on so many levels.

It has opened up a whole new way of living. I am 34 years old and for about 32 of those years I lived on junk food. I used to joke that I should become a vegetarian but I hated vegetables! I have always hated any and all healthy food. I could and would try to live on cookies (preferably the dough), salt bagels dipped in blue cheese dressing, pretzels, cake, cheese, bread, basically anything carb-ish. 1he only vegetable I would touch was cucumber and that was only with iodized salt and dressing. I probably ate one piece of fruit a month. When I had to, I would eat a meal, but I preferred to eat junk instead. I started learning about raw foods when my husband became sick with ulcerative colitis. I learned even more when my son was born with food allergies to dairy, nuts and eggs. I honestly had no idea what to feed him. I started eating more fruits and trying to add veggies in when I could, and it was then that I really started trying to change the way I fed my whole family. I came up with a plan to try to go 100 percent raw and blog about it. My start date was to be June 1. It was then that I learned about the Raw Food Cleanse research project and decided it would be the perfect support so I signed up.

Raw food has turned my life around 180 degrees. I can love more, appreciate others more and enjoy a better connection to myself and my spirit. I attribute all of this to being more nourished, which is what a raw lifestyle has offered me. My body is now no longer fighting to be fed. Today, instead of eating to cover up what's not working in my life, my focus is on giving my body raw meals that are of the highest nutrition possible. Today I honor and nurture myself. The food addictions that ran my life and took me away from living are a thing of the past. My body no longer demands and suffers with cravings, as now I am listening to what I really need. The struggle of malnutrition is over and all that is left is living and loving my life to the fullest each day. Lowanna' s achievements are truly amazing, and she was such an inspiration to the group. Choosing to simply eat raw consistently since the end of 2008 has meant she has lost well over 100 pounds. Today Lowanna continues her raw lifestyle and is a living advocate of the benefits a raw life can offer.

I now recognize when I am truly hungry or eating emotionally. I was also dealing with a major health issue during this time, and everything I've learned in this program has helped me to understand that there is healing energy in the enzymes of live food. I was able to double my raw food intake during these 11 weeks, and my goal is to stay around 75 percent raw. I am choosing this as a lifestyle-it's not about the weight. I love myself now and I would love me even if I didn't weigh less. I just want to be healthy in my mind, body and soul. Kali Amato, 48 lorain, Ohio When I juice, drink Green Smoothies and eat fruits/veggies and salads, I feel awesome. I feel so connected to Spirit and feel the energy flowing through me and with me. When I eat foods like nuts, seeds, coconuts and avocados, I feel heavy and disconnected, so I'm learning to be mindful of that, reminding myself that more than one serving of those foods lowers my energy and seems to contribute to addictive eating patterns.

My mental clarity is improved, I feel truly optimistic and suddenly have a desire for exercise! I've started walking, which is a substantial accomplishment for me. I see the Raw Food Oeanse as a way to achieve your weight-loss goals as well as a long-term lifestyle choice for optimum health! Susan Bradbury, 47 Iron Mountain, Michigan Last Labor Day weekend, I felt like I was having a heart attack. I had major pains down my entire left side for three days. Being stubborn, I waited to go to the doctor until I felt I could drive myself. My blood pressure was off the charts at 220/120 ... strokeville! I was hospitalized for three days, but afterward I didn't fill the prescriptions: I decided to change my lifestyle instead. When I was finally forced to deal with these intense health issues, I chose a change of lifestyle over popping pills for symptoms. I knew the prescriptions would only be a Band-Aid. It was then that I started with raw foods. During the first three months, I lost 28 pounds, and that was with a broken foot that I couldn't even stand on.

It's okay to have some steamed veggies or pickled beets if that is what is available. I do try to stick with the veggies and fruits when making non-raw choices, however. Even though I started this raw food journey to lose weight, the health benefits have been so considerable that I plan to make this a permanent way of life. I have slowly incorporated raw foods into my family's diet and am already starting to see benefits in their health as well. I don't expect them to go totally raw, but they'll certainly be making healthier choices in their non-raw foods. Most of us who did the experiment found that we needed less food then we were eating before. I am sure it is because we are finally getting the nutrients from the foods we are eating. Even though I read a lot, being part of the group added to the overall experience in many ways. I also liked the fact that not being 100 percent raw was okay on the Raw Food Cleanse and that the 100- percent-raw police would not get on your case. This will be a lifestyle choice for me from here on out.

I've noticed some other nice changes, too. My period has become shorter and lighter-no more cramps at all- and emotionally, I'm a lot happier, cheerful and positive. People say my happiness is infectious and they like my attitude, my outlook on life and my caring nature. Friends and acquaintances say I look radiant, healthy and happy. Some people focus on the weight loss and get worried, but often they're just jealous. I feel a lot more comfortable with my body and my weight now.

I took an office job after being a housewife forever, and within six months I packed on 65 pounds. Over the last 12 years, I've tried to lose weight with so many diets I can't even count anymore. Each time I would do really well for two or three weeks and then end up bingeing on the weekend, gaining it all back plus some on top of that. I beat myself up each time.

My skin was really bad and I tried everything I knew to correct that, but with no luck. I had GERD (acid reflux) and was drinking water with baking soda every night to go to sleep. For about three years I would vomit in the night because of the GERD. One day when I was watching You Tube, I came across a video that said \"RAW VEGAN\" and I watched it. That day I probably watched 35 to 40 videos and found so many new and helpful websites. I went raw that day, haven't turned back and never will. I've even changed what I want to do with the rest of my life. I want to open a raw food restaurant and store in my town. I have lost a total of 35 pounds since I went raw and 15 during the Raw Food Cleanse Experiment. I truly feel amazing. This has become a life-transforming way of life for me, with no turning back. I can't shut up about raw foods. Leigh, 55, and Megan, 31 (mother and daughter) Tulsa, Oklahoma Leigh says: Honestly, I just feel better when I eat raw. Food seems to taste better and cleaner. For instance, I've noticed that I can eat a potato and I don't need to pile a bunch of other stuff on it to taste good. I actually enjoy the taste of the potato in and of itself. I notice the simple goodness of real food now. I find that I am much less a meat-based person now that I eat a high-raw-foods diet. I just don't crave it anymore.

Once I realized what I was dealing with, I became very serious about what I was putting into my mouth and my overall lifestyle choices. I was able to tolerate hideous, horrible chemo-chemo that is not FDA-approved outside of Houston Medical Center- plus four surgeries, like a 25-year-old (those were the doctor's very words). I've not only survived but am continuing to survive this cancer. I attribute this in large part to my diet. During chemo, when I could not eat much of anything, I could always eat raw and I craved fresh juices, particularly orange and carrot/ apple juice. Even at my most nauseated I could always drink fresh, raw juices. Sometimes that was all I could keep down. Now I've started running with my daughter, Megan, who joined me in the Raw Food Cleanse Experiment. We've each lost well over 10 pounds and we feel great. 1here's no doubt that this is a lifestyle we'll both continue well into the future. And from Megan: My mother was diagnosed with a rare cancer in my adult years. She wasn't given good odds of survival, so I was determined to help her find what would make her thrive. As a family we have made more of a conscious effort to eat our way to health through real food. My mother has recovered very well and has beaten the odds. I truly believe our bodies were made to heal themselves as long as we don't get in the way. We were designed to eat the fruits of the land, and if people would go back to the basics they would find that they are in control of their own health.

One of her biggest motivations in changing her diet for good has been observing her mother's illness and dependency on pre- scription drugs. She wants a better life for herself. I'm so proud of Melodie. She kicked 14 unwanted pounds to the curb while doing the Raw Food Cleanse, and she learned to like Green Smoothies as long as she used spinach (she's not a big fan of kale!).

At times I would eat unhealthy things, but overall I did pretty well. I do feel much better than I did 11 weeks ago. Some benefits of doing the Raw Food Cleanse: I sleep so much better. My hot flashes disappeared. Pain from my trigger thumb is gone. My hair stopped falling out and seems much fuller. I feel a new sense of calm, almost like an inner peace.

Now that I buy items with \"natural\" packaging, I have very little trash. I love having a blended smoothie for a meal. It's the easiest way to get a lot of fruits and vegetables in, especially the greens. Juicing is another way to get nutrients, but without the fiber. I don't like it as much as smoothies, but I did juice an entire watermelon yesterday and it was amazing-really refreshing. Not only am I using raw food for weight loss, I'm also using it for disease prevention. I'm at the age where things can really begin to fall apart, and I've been pretty lucky so far.

Delaney Berrini, 33 Minneapolis, Minnesota Even though I had followed a raw food diet before finding the Raw Food Oeanse opportunity, I feel like I was able to go raw and stay high raw this time because of my discipline with green juices. No matter what, every morning, I juiced. With the greens flowing through me, I had no cravings for anything that wasn't good for my body or part of my journey. Plus the juicing allowed me to eat fewer meals and helped my digestion because I wasn't snacking all day. Normally, I eat all day. Juicing is king!

I'm not stressing so much about my \"rawness\" like I did in the past. I realize that I may eat more or less fat or more or less fruit along my journey but I will stay high raw. The key is not becoming too dogmatic. I have to monitor and see how my body reacts as I switch things in and out of my diet. I cannot follow raw \"gurus\" and make their diets mine. I have to figure it out for myself. This is a big lesson I learned. I've continued to release weight, 17 pounds altogethe~ and even though I'm slender now, I feel that my body is still surprising me with new healthful discoveries. One of the best discoveries for me was that I can still build muscle without eating meat. I used to be into a high protein diet (in my twenties) and dated men who insisted I had to eat meat to build muscle. I saw an ex-boyfriend over the weekend. I was carrying a box, and he commented on my muscled arms. I said, ''Yeah. Nice, huh?\" He said, \"Even without protein .... \" Fruits and veggies have protein!

Here's what she had to say about the experience: In November of 2008, I was searching for weight-loss stories on You Tube. One in particular that I found was Angela Stokes-Monarch. I was really amazed at how beautiful she was after her dramatic weight loss. She looked healthy, hydrated and happy. I was also encouraged, thinking, \"She was fatter than me! I only need to lose 60 pounds. I love vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds; I like raw food .... I can do this!\" So on November 15, 2008, I started my raw food journey. Beginning weight: 206 pounds. You Tube became my raw food information headquarters. I subscribed to around 50 raw food channels and received at least two or three new videos a day. This is where I found the lovely Penni Shelton. A very pretty blue-eyed redhead like myself, Penni was already successful on raw food. She gave me a vision. I quickly learned that the key to success with this way of eating was preparation. I would cut up salad for three hours (12 heads of romaine lettuce with all the fixings) about every four days. Package it up in Ziploc bags. My refrigerator was immediately turned into my new fast food drive-thru. I would eat seasonal fruit. When I first started, apples were in season and they tasted amazing. I would eat three or four apples a day. When I started green smoothies, I noticed my cravings went away. This became the way I could get enough nutrients into my body. I now consume two or three bunches of kale a day in the form of smoothies. 215"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"RAW FOOD CLEANSE 1he first week I lost 10 pounds. I was stoked.

Something about the approach made me feel safe. Actually, I think it was fate. I was surfing the net one day when I came across Penni's name and I clicked on it. It happened to be a Sunday, May 31, the last day to sign up as a guinea pig for the Raw Food Cleanse Experiment. I debated- should I or not?

He even served in the United States military for a few years, maintaining a buff, athletic build. His family of origin are all average-sized people. So, when Dennis signed up as one of my research guinea pigs, I wanted to know his story. How did Dennis end up top- ping the scales at nearly 550 pounds just two years ago? From the very beginning, I was particularly fascinated with Dennis's positive can-do attitude, and even though he weighed in a few hundred pounds heavier than all the other participants, I knew there was something different, 220"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"Real Stories from Raw Food Superheroes something very special about Dennis. In an early e-mail, Dennis shared details of his personal story, and we have talked via telephone many times since. Dennis began to put on weight in his mid twenties. At that time he went through a very stressful marriage and separation, and it was then that he began to seek comfort in food. Once officially divorced, he gravitated toward fast, convenient food as a way of life and to pacify himself, especially late at night As the years went by, Dennis kept getting larger. Dennis's career afforded him the financial ability to eat out whenever he liked. Since he traveled a lot in his pro- fession, he would enjoy dining out often, usually for all three meals, including a late-night drive-thru habit as a reward for working long, hard days. Food was his com- fort, but over time his eating patterns and dramatic weight gain began to deeply concern his family and close friends. Dennis shared that at one point he would drive to a local recycling facility in the middle of the night to secretly weigh himself on their one-ton commercial utility scale. This is actually how he found out that he was pushing 550 pounds. This was his first wake-up call, so he scheduled an appointment with a nearby doctor who performed gas- tric bypass surgery, thinking that would be his only hope. After a three-hour seminar and a one-hour preliminary consultation with the doctor, Dennis learned that this doc- tor would not agree to do the surgery for insurance reasons. At this point, Dennis nearly lost all hope for ever living a normal life again. One precious detail that Dennis shared with me is that no matter what happened, his mother never gave up on him. She was always loving, encourag- ing and non-judgmental, even though he knew she was deeply concerned about his binge eating and weight. 221"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"RAW FOOD CLEANSE A few more years passed and Dennis saved enough money for a newer procedure that was being offered in his area, Lap-Band surgery. He made the appointment once he had the funds together (nearly $20K) and eagerly went to talk with the doctor, ready to schedule the surgery. After spending a good amount of time on all the preliminaries, the doctor came in only to tell Dennis that the hospital wouldn't allow the surgery to be done on anyone over 400 pounds. Dejected once again, Dennis became hopeless. To make matters worse, the downturn in the economy created a near standstill in Dennis's line of work. With the stock market crashing and the housing market nearly down the tubes, in January 2008 Dennis decided to move in with his mother and stepfather as a way to stay afloat in uncertain economic times. This move turned out to be a good situation, as his mother's cooking was relatively healthy and she even encouraged him to use his YMCA membership to get some much-needed exercise. Dennis's aunt gave him the book God's Way by George Malkmus, which planted the first seed in his mind of raw foods. Exercise and his mother's cooking helped Dennis lose about 40 pounds that year, which was encouraging, but hardly a dent in his massive frame. In May of 2009, Dennis hit another low point. His mother had made a large meal one Sunday morning before going to church. The meal was one of Dennis's favorites-the main entree was a big casserole dish of shepherd's pie. Normally Dennis would enjoy the Sunday meal with his parents after they returned home from church. This particular Sunday his parents decided to stay at church for a lunch event, and they told Dennis to go ahead and have lunch without them. By the time they arrived home, Dennis had devoured the entire meal, leav- 222"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"Real Stories from Raw Food Superheroes ing not even a morsel for his family. His parents were star- tled and deeply concerned when they realized that he had eaten a meal large enough to serve at least six adults-in one sitting, all by himself. Dennis immediately felt rage, but he also realized things had spiraled out of control. The guilt and humiliation from this episode is what ultimately led him to the Raw Food Oeanse. There was no doubt in either of our minds that God ultimately orchestrated Den- nis's finding my video calling for willing guinea pigs that afternoon. I started the Raw Food Cleanse Experiment on June 1, 2009. I weighed in at 484.6 pounds, and I was extremely unhappy (even if I didn't admit it). After just two weeks on the program, I had lost 24 pounds, and man, were my eyes suddenly wide open to a whole new world! For the next nine weeks I continued to lose weight at an average rate of 4 pounds a week. I even did a three-day juice cleanse, which totally cleaned out my system and gave me tons of energy. When I made salads I would use anywhere from 13 to 20 different ingredients; the more, the better! My world opened up to chia seeds and young coconut water-and now I'm about to start growing my own wheatgrass. When I started this experiment, I had realized that I was actually killing myself with the amount and kinds of foods I was eating, but in just a short amount of time on raw, I came to understand that I could live an amazing, full life without depriving myself. Talk about gaining some mental clarity! I now have hope that life can be better than it ever was before. For the first time I truly believe that I can and will have an active, healthy, vibrant life. I've also made friends that have really helped me along this journey-real friends that I will 223"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"RAW FOOD CLEANSE keep for life. On August 6, I dedicated my life to living a raw food lifestyle from here on out. There's no going back now!

In 11 weeks Dennis lost 64 pounds while gaining his life back.
