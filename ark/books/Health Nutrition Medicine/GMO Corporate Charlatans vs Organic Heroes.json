GMOs: Corporate Charlatans Versus Organic Heroes Democratic and Republican administrations, and Congress, have repeatedly ignored the overwhelming majority of Americans who favor labeling genetically engineered (GE) food in the marketplace. Our politi- cians seem to be listening to the corporate executives (donors) instead of the citizenry. But in California, the people have a right to cra\u001f laws of their choosing. Proposition 37, on the ballot in California on November 6, would mandate labeling of foods containing GE ingredients. If we win this \u001eght in California, manufactur- ers will likely begin to label food nationally for GE ingredients.
