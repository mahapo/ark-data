I raised my hand. “Is it true that you have discovered a novelpathogen in this disease?” I had heard a rumor but my expectations couldn’t havebeen lower. Silence ensued while Judy Mikovits gripped the sides of the podiumas if weighing her options. “Yes,” she finally said. There was scatteredlaughter in the hall, as if she had just made a joke. Only an audience of peoplewho have been ill for a very long time and who have even the slightest knowledgeof the fraught history of their disease could be so devoid of hope that such aclaim could be considered laughable. “It’s not a new pathogen,” Mikovits pressedon, suddenly lowering her voice to a degree barely audible. “But it is new tothis disease. We have submitted a paper to Science,” she added.On that intriguing scientific riddle, the annual scientific conference held bythe U.K. charity Invest in ME at One Birdcage Walk near London’s Houses ofParliament ended. It was May of 2009. My friendship and professionalrelationship with Judy Mikovits began. She could not have imagined the infernoshe was about to enter, the ups and downs and startling turns of which aredescribed in this book.I would watch and listen in sympathy over the next three years as Mikovits,challenged and derided by critics in a way few scientists will ever experience,seemed to leap from one circle of hell to another. Ultimately, her crime wouldemerge as heresy, a sub rosa charge reserved for anyone who dared offer evidencefor a viral cause and, worse, transmissibility, in a disease governments onevery continent had for three decades effectively disappeared with acontradictory mélange of explanations, none of them logical.With her pending publication still undergoing editing, Mikovits was about tolead a battle charge in what has often been described as medicine’s holy war.But then, the eleven-syllable “myalgic encephalomyelitis,” understandablyshorthanded to “ME,” has never been regarded as an ordinary disease, nor has thepublic health response to it been anywhere near normal. Instead, it’s beensaddled with an extraordinary burden of meaning, a word Susan Sontag employed inher famous essay “Illness as Metaphor.” “Nothing is more punitive than to give adisease meaning—that meaning invariably being a moralistic one,” Sontag wrote.“Any important disease whose causality is murky, and for which treatment isineffectual, tends to be awash in significance.”Since its emergence in the late 1970s in pandemic form, ME has been touted as apsychiatric affliction of people “with poor coping strategies or histories ofunachievable ambition,” as one American government scientist wrote in aninfluential paper in 1988. “Ultimately, any hypothesis regarding the cause of[ME] must incorporate the psychopathology that accompanies it and, in somecases, precedes it,” he added. Aided by a passive lay press, governmentscientists have sought to dismiss the disease by labeling sufferers with allmanner of deficiencies and malevolent motives. That list has includedmalingering and cheating welfare systems, being either sympathy-seekers or TypeA personalities who one day simply fell apart, or people who read about thedisease and “wanted to have it.” The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) probablywins any contest as to which US government entity has done more to trash victimsand belittle the disease. CDC has trotted out “hysteria,” “yuppie burn out,” agenetically-linked “inability to handle stress,” a history of childhood sexualmolestation, “doctors working themselves into a frenzy,” “collusion betweenpatients and doctors,” and “an epidemic of diagnoses,” to name a few of theuntenable “causes” handed down from on high over the past thirty years.Any collective memory of just how suddenly and aggressively this disease emergedin the late 1970s and early 1980s, especially in large coastal cities like NewYork, Boston, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, recedes with each passing year.Anyone born after, say 1985 or 1990, will be unable to recall a period in theirown lives when this scourge was virtually unknown. Yet, by the mid-1980s,distressed doctors and desperate patients had turned the disease into the topcategory of inquiry at both the Centers for Disease Control and public healthdepartments in the major cities of this country; eventually, their calls both tothe CDC and NIH exceeded queries about AIDS at the height of the AIDS epidemic.In 1988 a small group of worried scientists and research clinicians met todiscuss the disease and its origins in Newport, Rhode Island. Charles Carpenter,professor of medicine at Brown University Hospital noted, “We’re seeingsomething that wasn’t there in the fifties and sixties. Most of us feel this isnew. If this had been going on in the fifties and sixties, even if we haddiscarded it as psychiatric, it would have been written about, and it’s not inthe literature. And that suggests there is a dominant agent that’s driving thedisease.” Another doctor, Paul Cheney, agreed. “How could we have possiblymissed this disease for all these years?” he asked. “Although a large number ofpatients are subtle and may not be that sick, there are a significant number ofpatients who are really quite incredible, and I just can’t believe the medicalprofession could have watched this—missed this—for decades, or millennia. It’stoo striking.” Twenty-six years after Carpenter and Cheney voiced theirconcerns, current estimates place the number of sufferers worldwide at twentymillion, with a million or more of them in the US, exceeding the number ofpatients with breast and lung cancer, AIDS, and multiple sclerosis combined.Today, a doctor in New York City Skypes with patients in Uzbekistan, Scotland,and Norway. Japanese, Chinese, and Latvian investigators attend medicalconferences in San Francisco. ME is now the most common chronic disease mostpeople have never heard of until they acquire it.By 2009, when Mikovits appeared on the scene, ME was a disease with a shockinghistory of neglect that rose to the level of government-sanctioned human rightsviolations perpetrated upon millions around the world. Patients were denied notmerely medical care, pay outs on disability claims, and the emotional supportthat might have been forthcoming from family and friends had they suffered froma “real” disease, they had been thoroughly disenfranchised and subjected toridicule and abuse from all quarters. If they were children, they were deniededucations. Adults and children were on occasion incarcerated in psychiatricinstitutions against their wills, a ghastly outcome resulting, in at least somewell-documented cases, their deaths. The spiral into years and decades ofpoverty that frequently accompanied onset of the disease was perhaps the mostintolerable outcome of all.ME was a storm gathering on the horizon in the late 1970s, a rumored malady thatsounded too incredible to believe: “Like mono—except you never recover,” was howthe disease was first described to me by a fellow journalist who had his ear tothe ground. This once rare disease was about to explode in tandem with the AIDSepidemic, but those with ME would share a very different fate. Rather than spendbillions of dollars on research and reorder the medical research cosmos on itsbehalf, public health authorities would seek to disappear ME by any meansavailable, whether by marginalizing its victims or, as documented in my bookOsler’s Web, conspiring to prevent Congressionally mandated research on it.There is a magnificent treatise waiting to be penned about the divergent pathstaken by governments of great nations as regards AIDS and ME, so thinlyseparated as to symptoms and aberrant biological signs. Both diseases have ashallmarks a deranged immune system that allows myriad viral infections topropagate—viruses that normally would remain latent, an elevated cancer risk,dementia, and more. As long ago as 1986, a top neurologist was unable todifferentiate the two diseases while studying MRI brain scans of ME patientspocked with multiple small lesions and reduced gray matter and those of patientswith AIDS-related dementia, or “ARD.” Patients suffer from a devastating cascadeof symptoms rendering them ghosts of the people they once were; more than halfbecome completely disabled, a quarter permanently bed-bound. Recovery is rare.Morbidity studies have demonstrated that ME patients are as ill as end-stageAIDS sufferers, advanced cancer patients, and people dying from congestive heartfailure.* * *With her publication in Science the following October, Mikovits would providehighly persuasive evidence for an AIDS-like viral infection existing in close to70 percent of patients and 4 percent of healthy controls. The virus was calledXMRV and had been discovered at the University of California in 2006. A memberof the gammaretrovirus family, XMRV was classified as a murine leukemia virus,one which likely had jumped from its natural “reservoir”—mice—to humans at somejuncture in the recent past. Although XMRV’s discovery had aroused littlefanfare, Mikovits’s data drawing an association between the virus and ME, rareimmune cancers, and, eventually, autism, raised a firestorm three years later.If her data were right, then ten million people in America alone were infected,but asymptomatic, with this virus. At one juncture during the ensuing scientificfracas an incredulous vice president of the American Red Cross, Roger Dodd,dubbed Mikovits’s findings, “The Doomsday Scenario.” In other words, it was toohorrible to be true.A media-stoked controversy erupted as laboratories around the world sought toreplicate the findings in ME patients, a drama that played out over the nextthree years with a kind of fury rarely seen in science. Famous scientistsshouted over each other’s presentations during normally staid conferences;relationships shattered and paranoia blossomed, revealing scientists to be notatypical of the rest of humanity. Publications as diverse as The Economist andScience News followed the story faithfully and with bemused interest, as if theoften down and dirty dash to confirm or deny was a tennis match instead of apressing scientific matter, the outcome of which had the potential to affect theeconomies of nations. One highly conservative estimate of the annual loss to theU.S. economy from ME was $20 billion, a figure based on the unreasonableassumption that everyone disabled by the disease had been earning just $20,000 ayear when they fell ill. Given the history of the long-politicized disease atthe center of the controversy, the uproar was hardly surprising.Yet, the baseball hat and flip-flop wearing scientist at the center of thecontroversy, who bragged of her shared ancestry with Attila the Hun, was asurprise. She was forty-six, with oftentimes unkempt, sun-streaked hair, andwide, innocent-looking blue eyes. She looked like she would be happiest at thehelm of a sail boat in some far reaches of the Pacific Ocean. In reality, shewas a molecular biologist and biochemist and the author of approximately fiftypublications on the immunology of HIV, its cancers, and the chemistry of drugsto fight its infections. A twenty-two year veteran of the National CancerInstitute, she had been mentored in her early years by Frank Ruscetti in his labat Ft. Detrick, Maryland. Ruscetti was himself a veteran of Robert Gallo’sbrutally competitive AIDS lab.Perhaps understandably, sufferers of this disease felt that with thematerialization of Mikovits and her collaborators—especially Ruscetti,codiscoverer of the first human retrovirus in 1980—the grownups had arrived.Certainly, Mikovits was not and would never be among the beleaguered MEclinicians and researchers of past decades, a stalwart if tiny fraternity inperpetual need of funds, well-known to each other and to patients. Since theearly 1980s, the latter had existed as if in some kind of dystopian paralleluniverse, in possession of information they deemed urgent but in which fewbesides themselves were interested. A constant at their scientific conferenceswere the ashen-faced patients, mostly women, lying in fetal positions on thecarpeted corridors outside the hotel ballrooms, blankets pulled up to theirnecks; somehow they had made their way there but the effort cost themeverything.Certainly, there was little doubt that Mikovits was a different kind ofscientist, one who didn’t seek the approval of the top guns at the NIH and whowasn’t afraid to upbraid scientists at the CDC whether via email or in person.Indeed, she had a quality of fierceness rarely seen in science. She would callXMRV “. . . the biggest epidemic in United States history,” one destined “toturn the U.S. into the equivalent of HIV-riddled sub-Sahara Africa” if itcontinued unabated. She labeled the Centers for Disease Control “criminal” forwhat she saw as the agency’s failure to control the spread of XMRV. Inside herlab, the Atlanta agency’s acronym stood for “Can’t, Don’t Care.” She and herstaff derided the agency’s method of selecting patients—by random telephonesurveys—calling the government’s cohort “Publisher’s Clearinghouse” patients.Judy Mikovits was unshakable in her convictions and harsh on her critics whomshe considered biased, occasionally dishonest, and often ill-informed. She was acharming advocate of patients. Startlingly for a scientist, she even consortedwith them, seeking them out and befriending them, once posting her personalemail address prominently to the blogosphere. Her rationale was not just humanebut utterly reasonable: her understanding of this disease arose from patientsand their histories and she formulated hypotheses for scientific experimentsbased on what she heard and observed. The ancient Greeks would have laudedMikovits for her methods, but in the 21st Century, she was an oddball.As far as other scientists were concerned, perhaps her greatest sin was herpublic conjecture about what her data might imply for other unsolved diseases,especially autism, a malady that vied with ME as a bio-political hot-button. Shehad identified family clusters in which parents and other close adult relativessuffered from ME and children suffered from autism, and found evidence forgammaretrovirus infection in victims of both diseases. It was one thing to posescientific hypotheses about controversial disorders over drinks at theconference hotel bar with lab colleagues, but to explain in some detail suchhypotheses on day-time television talk shows or to journalists from majorAmerican newspapers, as Mikovits did, was another matter. Federal scientists,who frequently confuse their mandate to perform research with a mandate toprevent public panic, were especially unnerved by the use of words like“infection” and “transmission” in the same sentence with words like “autism” or“lymphoma,” and certainly in conjunction with what the CDC calls—in preferenceto ME—“chronic fatigue syndrome.”Of course, it’s a rare and delicate venture in science to be first and fewhazard the risk. Mikovits’s primary Science collaborator and unabashed admirer,Ruscetti, said of Mikovits, “What I always tried to teach her is, learn thescientific method and learn it well so that you can publish something that 99percent of the [scientific] community might say, ‘You are wrong,’ but which youknow is right. That is the courage of a true scientist, and Judy has that.”Perhaps it’s unsurprising that for the next three years, Mikovits stood unbowedat the center of a crackling scientific storm that raged over severalcontinents. If she was correct, and a highly infectious retrovirus was in factthe cause of “chronic fatigue syndrome” and ten million Americans were alreadyinfected—well, that not only changed the geometry but shattered the credibilityof the nation’s bulwark against infectious disease, the CDC and it’s moreprestigious sister agency, the National Institutes of Health.By year three, pondering the five-foot-five-inch Mikovits and her place in thescientific cosmos brought to mind Abraham Lincoln’s purported remark to HarrietBeecher Stowe, “So you’re the little woman who wrote the book that started thisgreat war!”* * *Mikovits had been so insulated in what could be called the HIV-AIDS researchbubble, she had never heard of ME until being enlisted as scientific director ofa new institute affiliated with the University of Nevada in Reno. What drew herto such a foolhardy fate? A rush of intuition, facts lining up with facts, herknowledge of AIDS immunology, a Eureka moment. “I spent my whole life working onthis. I just didn’t know it,” she would say later.In 2006 she sat in the audience at a conference in Barcelona and listened to aveteran of the ME wars, a doctor who had seen thousands of patients and hadlearned about the disease in real time right along with them, talk about a groupof 300 patients he had followed for years. Dan Peterson of Nevada, an internalmedicine specialist with a wait list measured in years, described what Mikovitswould call “opportunistic infections” in these patients; multiple immunedeficiencies; a kind of sub-acute encephalopathy that lowered IQ and destroyedeven the brightest patients’ ability to think straight, complemented by abnormalbrain scans using several technologies. The doctor offered data for cytokine“storms,” an onslaught of inflammatory proteins like interferon that leveledvictims, generated in response to infections. He noted that 5 percent ofpatients in this carefully observed group had rare immune system cancers thatwould be expected to occur in the general population at rates closer to .02percent. In all, 77 of the 300 had either blood cancers or cellular changes thatwere predictive of lymphoma.Mikovits was struck to her core. “It’s a retrovirus,” she thought, almost sayingthe words out loud. HIV was one of three retrovirus families known to infecthumans; maybe there were four, Mikovits wondered. Long known to infect domesticanimals such as cats and cattle as well as wild animals, retroviruses causedcancer, immune deficiency, and horrendous neurodegenerative diseases. If thedisease Peterson described wasn’t AIDS, it was akin to AIDS or, as Mikovitswould say eventually, “the other AIDS,” or “non-HIV AIDS.” She leapt to themicrophone when Peterson finished. “I’m a cancer researcher,” she said. “Numberone, I look for viruses in cancer and number two, this smells like a virus.”Three years later, having met hundreds of sufferers on both sides of theAtlantic, she would comment, “It’s amazing to me that anyone could look at thesepatients and not see that this is an infectious disease that ruins lives.”* * *There is an immense backstory to Mikovits’s contemporary story; a heart-rendingtale of dashed scientific careers and broken-hearted people who have madeimportant-seeming discoveries about ME and ended up on the sidelines,incredulous that their work went unheralded and more importantly, unfunded. Notinfrequently, those discoveries were evidence for retroviral infection. Expertsfamiliar with the clinical manifestations of the disease, have recognizedretroviruses as a class of pathogens with the power to cause all the symptomsand outcomes they document: immune deficiency, neurodegenerative disease, andgreatly elevated rates of cancer. One reads again and again that the cause ofthe disease is “elusive” and the disease itself “mysterious.” Implicit in theseclichés is that some organized, concerted effort has been undertaken to solvethe mystery, to no avail. Contrary to popular belief, however, searches for acausative infectious agent in the disease have been rare, limited in scope, andfor the most part, either poorly funded or virtually unfunded.As long ago as the early 1980s, Campbell Murdoch, a local doctor in Dunedin, NewZealand, began referring patients to University of Otago microbiologist andmedical doctor Michael Holmes, a dark-haired, enthusiastic, and open-mindedyoung scientist whose appearance and temperament were compared by his colleaguesto Henry VIII. Interestingly, the disease was known popularly in Dunedin as“Poor Man’s AIDS.” The South Island of New Zealand was hit by the malady by thelate 1970s perhaps most famously in the small town of Tapanui, a village lessthan two hours inland from coastal Dunedin. Locals there adopted the mellifluousname “Tapanui Flu.” Holmes, whose primary interest was “clinicalimmunovirology,” spent several years prior to his retirement in 2002 studying“Poor Man’s Aids” for evidence of retroviruses.In 1986, using the equivalent of $690 given to him by patients, Holmes looked atsix sufferers and six healthy controls and discovered reverse transcriptase, anenzyme used by retroviruses in their replication process, in four of sixpatients. In addition, he found “. . . cells with convoluted nuclei comparableto those described in the ARC [AIDS-related complex] syndrome. These were notpresent in controls.”“We would like to propose a retrovirus etiology for CFS based not only on thispilot study but on the train of deductive observation which led us to considerit in the first place,” Holmes wrote. Part of that deductive observation hadbeen the cytokine “interferon” seen in extremely high levels in ME patients. “.. . [T]he most powerful interferon inducers are retroviruses,” Holmes added.Two years later, Holmes was awarded $7,000 from patients to continue the hunt,this time with twenty patients. Again, he saw the “convoluted nuclei” also seenin HIV disease. Four years later, he had scrounged enough money to investigateanother twenty patients, with similar results. By then, 1991, Americanimmunologist Elaine DeFreitas had published her own discovery of retroviral genesequences in 80 percent of adult and child ME sufferers and in 4 percent ofcontrols. Unfortunately, DeFreitas had been, in Holmes’s memorable words, “. . .[S]avaged and thrown to the wolves.” As a direct result, in his opinion,Holmes’s interesting research reached a dead end with the scientificestablishment in New Zealand and the rest of the world. After Holmes presentedhis findings at an ME conference in 1994 in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida—the onlystudy on causality out of sixty presentations—a CDC epidemiologist, KeijiFukuda, who today is the Assistant Director-General for Health, Security, andEnvironment at the World Health Organization, told me matter-of-factly, “To talkabout etiologies is to raise false hopes. . . . It will not be agent X causingdisease Y.”Fukuda’s comments were representative of the denialist mindset the peppery,often sardonic DeFreitas encountered at the CDC when, after her discovery wasreported in Newsweek and several major newspapers, scientists in Atlantaapproached her. DeFreitas, who was a fast-rising star at the Wistar Institute inPhiladelphia and had been mentored by its world-famous director, HilaryKoprowski, commanded about as much respect from the male retrovirologists at CDCas did the patients whose blood she was studying. In defiance of protocol, theyrefused to follow her methods at every turn. Ignoring her proscription againstfreezing blood, scientists froze ME blood samples in order to take vacations.They employed chemical reagents DeFreitas had warned against, they cast asidereagents she recommended, they regarded the ratios of particular nutrientsDeFreitas used to nurture her cell cultures (and the virus) as unimportant.“There’s always enough time to do it wrong, but never enough time to do itright,” DeFreitas noted at the time. She also said, presciently, “If a plaguewere to hit this country, the CDC would be the last to know.”Eventually, DeFreitas urged the agency to send a scientist to her lab inPhiladelphia to work side by side with her. She would bring the horses to waterand hope they ’d drink. Wistar director Koprowski offered the institute’sluxurious corporate apartment to CDC scientists as lodgings. Citing a lack ofmoney to pay the round-trip airfare of a scientist from Atlanta, CDCadministrators refused both invitations. That’s how much the US governmenteither didn’t care or didn’t want to know what DeFreitas had found in victims ofthis rapidly spreading disease.“The CDC is culpable,” Mikovits told me during one conversation aboutDeFreitas’s discovery. “They let an entire generation become infected. I thinkthey all know there’s a huge class action lawsuit here.”By the time CDC officials published their failure to confirm DeFreitas’s findingin not just one but four publications and had written a letter to her bosssuggesting she be fired, academic scientists were comparing DeFreitas to Joan ofArc. She had dared propose an infectious etiology for ME; she had dared to turnit into a “real” disease. I always thought a comparison with the mythologicalCassandra more apt.DeFreitas’s then-seventy-five-year-old boss Koprowski was a Polish émigré of the1930s and considered by many to be personally responsible for the European“brain drain” of the 1950s during which scientists left Europe in droves forAmerica; many of them found a home at the Wistar Institute. Koprowski, who tooka great interest in ME and characterized it as an “infectious disease of thebrain,” told me he believed the NIH needed an institute akin in size and scopeto the National Cancer Institute to fight ME and other burgeoning centralnervous system diseases. Koprowski believed all of them would turn out to havean infectious cause, much like polio and rabies.With DeFreitas’s tantalizing findings demolished by the CDC, research into thecause of ME rapidly slid into a scientific equivalent of the Mojave Desert,where the disease lay like a corpse for twenty years to be picked over by ascavenging psychiatric “lobby,” as patients call the still-influentialpsychiatrists. The latter have turned ME into a winking euphemism they call“bodily distress syndrome,” characterized by “medically unexplained symptoms,”a.k.a., “M.U.P.S.” They have managed to persuade much of the medicalestablishment that cognitive behavioral therapy is an effective treatment.Certainly, talk therapy is less expensive to administer than a full-out researcheffort into the cause.Federal dollars to search for pathogenic etiologies would never be forthcoming.Nihilism settled over those rare iconoclastic clinician investigators and evenrarer scientists who continued to find the malady alarming. They returned topublishing papers about symptoms, things like the pompously titled“post-exertional malaise”—the inevitable crash that occurs in patients who exertthemselves—or impaired blood flow to the brain, or pathologically low bloodpressure. There are today some 5,000-plus papers on abnormalities in ME thathave appeared in scientific journals since the dawn of the 1980s, yet governmentofficials continue to tell reporters “There are no biomarkers.” With Swiftianlogic, the same officials tell each other that the disease needs to be brokeninto myriad “subsets” because, they insist, it’s simply unimaginable thateveryone could have the same thing—a new way of saying, as did the CDC’s KeijiFukuda twenty years ago, “. . . it will not be a case of agent X causing diseaseY.”After meeting Judy Mikovits in London in the spring of 2009, I wondered: had theday of reckoning arrived? Would Mikovits be the scientist who would resolve thisdisease or would she go down in flames? Without meaning to be cryptic, I believethe answer is a bit of “yes” on both counts.* * *“We have CDC-proofed this paper,” Mikovits assured me in September of 2009shortly before her study was published in Science. She might have been new tothe disease, but she was well acquainted with its political history. Earlier, inJuly, her work had held up beautifully when two AIDS experts at the NationalCancer Institute called a secret meeting of top gammaretrovirus experts todeliberate on the matter. The government’s primary concerns: how to manage anunpredictable public once the news of XMRV and its possible relationship tocancer was publicized and what to do about all those infected, asymptomaticpeople.“That’s the piece of the data that scared everybody,” Mikovits remembered. “Theydidn’t care about ‘chronic fatigue syndrome.’ Ten million people infected with aretrovirus of unknown pathogenic potential? In this country, by comparison,eight-hundred-thousand people are infected with HIV.”In the tumult that followed, concern turned to scorn when several laboratorieswere unable to confirm the work and, in time, a persuasive argument waspresented by an American scientist, initially a staunch Mikovits supporter, thatXMRV was a man-made virus, a “contaminant,” that had been spreading fromlaboratory to laboratory since the mid-1990s. Mikovits and her collaboratorsaccepted the verdict on XMRV but drowned out in the resulting furor and evenridicule was Mikovits’s voice. She insisted that evidence for gammaretrovirusinfection in ME remained strong and was deserving of continued study. As withHIV, she argued, likely there were multiple strains of the pathogen and shenoted that her research supported that hypothesis. She also referenced anotherscientist, a reclusive interferon expert named Sydney Grossberg, who had beenquietly pursuing his own discovery of a retrovirus in an ME patient since theearly 1990s at the University of Wisconsin. Indeed, in May 2013, once XMRV waslaid to rest, Grossberg published his observation that the pathogen was a memberof the gammaretrovirus family. Specifically, it was a murine leukemia virus asXMRV was believed to be. It was, he continued, distinct from XMRV. Grossbergwent on to suggest that in future studies, his techniques be used to “expand thedetection” of a subset of viruses “related to [murine leukemia viruses].”** * *Would Mikovits have been treated as harshly had she been a man? Certainly, thediscoverers of XMRV were men and none of them suffered the malignant newscoverage, Internet hazing, or public drubbing she would suffer. Wouldjournalists Jon Cohen and Martin Enserink of Science have tagged-teamedMikovits, as they did in the summer of 2012, to produce an eight-page classicwork of character assassination in September of 2011 in Science? Enserinktrailed Mikovits around Brussels and the university town of Leuven, Belgium,during a scientific conference there, and Cohen later followed her fromCalifornia to Reno, apparently in large part to obtain her jail mug shot, whichappeared on page one of their story. I witnessed Mikovits talk herself hoarsewith Enserink over a period of days in an effort to explain her scientificmethods and hypotheses; I failed to recognize a word she had said to him in thearticle that resulted.Or was it the fact that the public health establishment largely perceives ME asa disease of women, resulting in derision and dismissal not just of patients butof the scientists who seek to identify the etiology of their disease, especiallyif they, too, are women? As recently as December 2013, one newly-retired NIHscientist was asked by a patient at a medical conference in New York City whatthe NIH leadership really thought about this disease. After a pause in which heseemed to be weighing his words, the scientist replied, unsmilingly, “They hateyou.” Can the rocky history of an epidemic that so far has impacted two humangenerations be attributed to misogyny in the way foot-dragging on AIDS duringthe early 1980s is attributed to homophobia?Or does the explanation lie with the CDC and NIH imperative to save face, withthe need to avoid any admission that taxpayer-supported health agencies havefailed so profoundly and for so long? Or is it to do with the avoidance of theclass action lawsuits Mikovits predicted? We are not primed as a society toponder whether these agencies are conspiring, by default or purposefully, tokeep the population ignorant of real and present threats to our lives and thelives of our children. The history of this disease, however, and the oftendevastating experiences of scientists who have tried to crack the case, forceany thinking person to consider that possibility.What cannot be disputed: Judy Mikovits changed a stale quarter-century debateabout the legitimacy of ME to a conversation about its biological cause, itsmodes of transmission, and rational drug therapies. She reopened the Pandora’sBox that was slammed shut when the CDC attempted to bury Elaine DeFreitas. Shemade the disease real for a while, a momentous feat in itself, and moved thefocus of the scientific community away from its symptoms toward its cause. Shebroke the spell of nihilism. She also proposed a reasonable hypothesis about apossible infectious agent driving the autism epidemic; in a rational world, herhypothesis would be pursued aggressively. More broadly, Mikovits brought a oncequiet, even esoteric conversation among molecular and evolutionary biologistsout of the closet and into the mainstream: is it possible that one virus or aclosely-related family of viruses might be causing the neurological diseasessuch as ME, autism, even possibly ALS and Parkinson’s disease, as well as theepidemics of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and leukemia?One hopes for greater honesty and a new spirit of open-mindedness fromgovernment officials in the future. When so many are sick and the cost to theculture is so high, every discovery should be examined and explored without biasand with great urgency. Honest scientists need to know they will be supported intheir endeavors to solve difficult problems rather than “burned at the stake.”One hopes, too, for the salvation of the millions of people who have beendisappeared by their governments for having acquired a disease that cannot beacknowledged by those governments and those who will become ill in the yearsahead if there is a return to the status quo that Judy Mikovits disrupted forthree brilliant years.* Sidney E Grossberg et al., “Partial Molecular Cloning of the JHK RetrovirusUsing Gammaretrovirus Consensus PCR Primers,” Future Virology, Vol. 8, No. 5,April 18, 2013, 507–520."},{"pageContent":"PrologueThe ArrestI began comparing Judy Mikovits to Joan of Arc.The scientists will burn her at the stake, but herfaithful following will have her canonized.—Dr. John Coffin1 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Apfn_1]Friday, November 18, 2011“Is Dr. Judy home? I’m Jamie. I’m a patient and she knows me very well. She’llremember me. She said to come by any time.”That’s odd, Mikovits thought. Patients rarely showed up at her door. The onlyJamie she could think of was miles across the ocean in Hawaii, hardly a placeone comes from unannounced. “That’s okay, David. I’ll take it,” she said. Sheswept past her husband, giving him a quick glance to indicate everything wasokay as she walked to the door of her southern California beach bungalow.Judy often wondered what David must think of her crazy life. Did he know he wassigning up for a roller coaster ride when they married? She might be theworld-famous rock-star scientist, but he was the rock. As a teenager growing upin Philadelphia, Judy’s husband David Nolde had danced on Dick Clark’s AmericanBandstand to musicians such as Sam Cooke, Neil Sedaka, and the Everly Brothers.In his professional life he had been a personnel manager for various hospitals.He was the kind of man who was good at listening, understanding people, anddefusing tense situations. She was often called the brilliant one, but it wasDavid who understood what others tried to keep hidden.The woman standing at the door was tall and dark-haired, dressed in black. “Hi,Dr. Judy,” the woman said. “Do you remember me?”Judy Mikovits had her PhD in biochemistry and molecular biology from GeorgeWashington University and was an AIDS and cancer researcher of more than thirtyyears, but people often said she had a second career—a calling, in the languageof her strong Christian faith—as a patient advocate. Over the years she had runvolunteer cancer support groups and would often research and review treatmentoptions for people and accompany them on doctor visits. Most people wereterrified to be suddenly thrown into the medical system and were reassured byhaving someone along who understood the science. She also found that themajority of doctors welcomed the opinion of a researcher as they oftencomplained that they didn’t have time to keep current with the latest research.Most people she helped referred to themselves as her “patients” even though shewas not a treating physician. In the past few years she had moved from cancerresearch into a high-profile investigation of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronicfatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), taking the position of research director at thestart-up Whittemore Peterson Institute for Neuro-Immune Disease (WPI), housed atthe University of Nevada, Reno (UNR) campus. Mikovits developed the entireresearch program that culminated in an article in 2009 in the highly prestigiousresearch journal, Science¸ showing an association between a newly discoveredhuman retrovirus, XMRV (xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus) andME/CFS.2 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Apfn_2] There had been a partial retraction ofthe work a month earlier,3 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Apfn_3] but for many reasonsMikovits still believed the theory was sound and needed rigorous validation.Over the past five years Mikovits had counseled ME/CFS patients in much the samemanner as she had counseled cancer patients and felt she could tell prettyquickly if a person was suffering from the disorder. Patients were oftenunnaturally pale, sometimes too thin or overweight in a sickly way, and therewas something about the eyes that looked different. She understood that callingwhat these patients suffered from “fatigue” was like calling the atomic bombdropped on Hiroshima “fireworks.” Over a spectrum of severity, many of the mostseverely affected spent twenty-three hours a day in bed with the shades drawnbecause of their utter weakness and light sensitivity. Many of the patients hadbeen active, vital people before their affliction struck, with a good numberengaging regularly in rigorous athletic pursuits, like running marathons orlong-distance cycling. Their physical breakdown was often looked upon by doctorsas some sort of unconscious psychological disorder, as if these people who livedlife to the fullest had simply decided that life was no longer worth thetrouble.But the disease was without mercy, lasting for decades and taking decades frompatients’ expected lifetimes. The former chief of Viral Diseases for the Centersfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) claimed the level of disability of manyof these patients was similar to terminal AIDS patients and those in end-stagerenal failure, so patient comparisons to a “living death” were apt.4[../Text/031_Notes.html#Apfn_4] But the years generally did not bring death,although an unusual number of patients developed rare types of cancers, salivarygland tumors or B-cell lymphomas. This fact more than any other is what drew theformer cancer and AIDS researcher toward this research. Why would years of afatiguing illness result in an elevated rate of rare types of cancer? She feltthere were some intriguing avenues to explore.Yes, Judy Mikovits had learned a great deal about ME/CFS in the past five years.Judy stared at the woman in her doorway and felt a sudden chill. She was certainthe woman didn’t have the disease and that she wasn’t a patient she had everseen before. “I don’t know you,” Mikovits said to the woman and began to pushthe door shut.* * *Regan Harris first got to know Mikovits when she called the WPI in December of2009, after reading the Science article.5 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Apfn_5] Reganwas surprised and flustered to suddenly be speaking to an internationallyrecognized scientist, but Mikovits quickly put her at ease and asked Regan toshare her story. With a deep breath, Regan began by telling Mikovits she hadbecome sick in October of 1989, at the age of fourteen after a bout ofmononucleosis. The following year she had been diagnosed with ME/CFS and fromthat point on, life had been a roller coaster ride.Despite her ME/CFS, Regan had been able to graduate high school and had attendedcollege where she received a bachelor’s degree in psychology. While getting herdegree, Regan researched the issue of suicide among the ME/CFS population andhow these patients presented with a different psychological profile than peoplewith depression. Regan’s work eventually culminated in a poster presentationbefore a meeting of the American Psychology Society in 1998. After listening toRegan’s tale, Mikovits told her about an ongoing research study and asked if shewould like to participate. “I can never give you back the years of yourchildhood that were stolen from you,” said Mikovits, “but I think we can preventthis from happening to other kids. Will you help me take this thing downforever?”Galvanized by Mikovits’s confidence, Regan signed the forms and went to thegrand opening of the $77 million WPI and Center for Molecular Medicine at theUniversity of Nevada, Reno in August of 2010. There she met Annette and HarveyWhittemore and their daughter Andrea, who had also been struck with ME/CFS froma young age. Regan couldn’t wait to make her own contribution to this effort.Regan moved to Nevada in September of 2010. She planned on volunteering for theWPI, hoping it would lead to a paying job. Judy and David were warm andwelcoming, often taking Regan out to sample the local cuisine. When Regan firstarrived, David spent some time driving her around Lake Tahoe, eventuallyshuttling her to Glenbrook, the exclusive gated lakefront neighborhood where theWhittemores had one of their many residences. When David approached thegatekeeper at Glenbrook the large gates opened as he said, “Whittemore.”When they got to the Whittemore home, a historical residence known as theLakeshore House, complete with its own private dock, David motioned with a handand said, “What do you do when your family is too big to fit in one house? Youbuy the one next door as well!” The Whittemores owned two houses on Lake Tahoe.When Regan flew home to Massachusetts that Christmas, she couldn’t wait to tellher mother all about her run-in with the Nevada royalty. Regan gushed about thewealth and influence of the Whittemores, noting, “My God! They’ve even got amovie theater in their house. You would not believe this, Mom! Can you imaginewhat it’s gonna be like if I can work for them? It would be so cool.”Regan’s excitement was not fully celebrated by her New England mother, who said,“Regan, I never want you to be seduced by money and power. You remember onething: anybody who is powerful enough to give you everything is also powerfulenough to take it all away.”* * *Mikovits had almost latched the door when she heard a male voice shouting, “Holdon there!” A man, identifying himself as University of Nevada, Reno campussecurity, stepped out from behind one of the large bushes in her yard and strodequickly to the door. Dr. Mikovits knew this man—he had investigated therobberies that had taken place at the WPI when she had been the researchdirector. Where she had been research director.That was in the past now. On September 29, 2011, she was fired, receiving thedismissal call on her cell phone from Annette Whittemore, president of the WPI,as she walked home. While the experience of being fired could shake anybody, howmany could claim the news had been reported in the pages of the Wall StreetJournal?6 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Apfn_6] The article by the well-respectedjournalist Amy Dockser Marcus in her Health Blog section of the Wall StreetJournal had given a fair account of her firing:Whittemore told the Health Blog that she and Mikovits were not “seeingeye-to-eye” on who controlled the cells. Research on retroviruses and theirpossible connection to CFS as well as other diseases continues, she said. “Wewill keep going down that path as long as it continues to show promise,”Whittemore says.Annette Whittemore’s given reasons for firing Mikovits would change severaltimes over the ensuing months, but she detailed them in a letter sent to Dr.Mikovits on September 30, 2011, which among other things accused Dr. Mikovits of“insubordination”.7 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Apfn_7]On October 1, 2011, Dr. Mikovits sent a response to Annette Whittemoreaddressing the event that had ostensibly caused her firing as well as moreconcerns she had about the management of the WPI. Mikovits told Annette that asthe principal investigator on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) R01 grant,Mikovits alone was legally responsible for all resources on that grant and thatMikovits alone was the one who should have decided the appropriate allocation ofthose resources. Mikovits was pleased that Annette hoped for “a smoothtransition” regarding Mikovits’s departure. However, as Mikovits was theprincipal investigator on three grants housed at the WPI, two from the NIH andone from the Department of Defense (DOD), she told Whittemore that she fullyintended to continue her research on those same grants, but at anotherinstitution—once one was found. This is common practice in the scientificcommunity; the principal investigator takes the grants with her if she leavesthe institution.8 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Apfn_8]Her break six weeks earlier with the Whittemores had been sudden, but Mikovitswas eager to move forward with her life and research. The next day, she wasscheduled to fly out to New York City to participate in the celebration of amulti-million dollar ME/CFS initiative to be run by ME/CFS physician Dr. DerekEnlander of Mount Sinai Hospital. Mikovits and Enlander were also scheduled todiscuss ways in which they might collaborate after her depature from the WPI.But she would never make that trip.* * *A thud at her feet made Dr. Mikovits look down. She realized the woman haddropped a microphone and a recording device. “That’s illegal here,” saidMikovits. “You can’t record me without my permission.”“We’re just here to get your side of the story,” replied the woman as she pickedup the fallen items.“Fine then. You can come with me to my lawyer’s office. I’m on my way to meethim.” Mikovits again tried to close the door when three burly Ventura Countysheriff’s deputies came around from the driveway. One of the deputies wasbrandishing a yellow piece of paper. “We have a search warrant.”The deputies came onto the landing, pushed the door open, and proceeded to enterthe house, pushing Mikovits’s husband along with them. “David,” she called out.“Call the lawyer!”Just that morning she had called her attorney’s office to ask if there were anywarrants out for her arrest. On November 4, the WPI had filed a civil caseagainst her, claiming she left with intellectual property, specifically hernotebooks and computer files. As a principal investigator on three governmentgrants, Mikovits knew she was legally required to maintain and protect copies ofall data under federal regulations and her UNR contract as an adjunct professor.In addition, since her research was being challenged by the scientificcommunity, she needed to possess this information to defend the work. Theattorney had found her trepidation humorous and said he didn’t see anything thatserious arising out of the civil case. Just to calm her, he had checked. Therewere no arrest warrants.But Mikovits still sensed something terrible afoot. She believed she had causedher former employers considerable distress. Viral Immune Pathology Diagnostic(VIP Dx)—a for-profit clinical lab loosely associated with the WPI and owned bythe Whittemores and Lombardi—was selling an unvalidated diagnostic test for theXMRV retrovirus, one which they would later discontinue selling. They claimedthat she had approved VIP Dx’s tests, including a new serological one announcedunder her name, when she was not employed by VIP Dx and had not evaluated dataor statements made by the clinical lab.9 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Apfn_9]Mikovits believed she had cut off a lucrative source of revenue for the WPI whenshe had vocalized all of this on September 23, 2011, at the Ottawa Conference,saying “VIP Dx lab will not continue XMRV testing because it hasn’t been shownto be reproducible in the Blood Working Group [BWG].”10[../Text/031_Notes.html#Apfn_10]She was fired one week later.Others were already concluding the test was problematic after the release of thereport from the BWG, the group founded to investigate whether the retrovirusposed a threat to the blood supply.11 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Apfn_11]Next came the replication study coordinated by Dr. Ian Lipkin of Columbia, oneof the world’s most famous virologists. A few days after Mikovits was fired,Lipkin had called to ask if she had confidence in the integrity of her formeremployers, the Whittemores, to allow her to perform the study in Reno.12[../Text/031_Notes.html#Apfn_12]Mikovits told Lipkin that she did not have confidence that the study could beperformed at the WPI. It was not until November 14, 2011, that Lipkin emailedMikovits saying he had decided not to have the WPI participate in the study, adecision which would potentially cost the institute a great deal of money.13[../Text/031_Notes.html#Apfn_13]Despite these financial hardships to the Whittemores, Mikovits believed she wasacting the only way she knew how—as an ethical scientist.The woman in black took Mikovits by the arm and motioned for her to come outonto the porch. “We just want to hear your side of the story,” the womanrepeated. “Do you have any WPI property?”“I do not,” Dr. Mikovits answered. “Everything in this house is mine.”She knew what they were looking for. The research notebooks. The notebooks whichshe feared would have ended up on the bottom of Lake Tahoe, been altered, orotherwise kept from public view had she not secured them.The open access to research, especially research funded by the government wasthe property of all. She didn’t have the notebooks, didn’t even know where theywere, but she knew they were safe. She believed that her assistant, Max Pfost,had secured them. Whatever she had discovered, or the mistakes she had made, theevidence would be there for all the world to see.“Do you have a black laptop?” the woman in black asked.“Yes, it’s sitting right on the table, but it’s mine. It was a gift.”“From whom?”“Annette Whittemore.”* * *Mikovits remembered the extravagant 2007 Christmas party, the first WPIChristmas party, when Annette had presented her with the black laptop, a back-updisk drive, and a printer.14 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Apfn_14] The onlystipulation Annette put on her present was that Mikovits had to promise to backup the hard drive on the disk drive that stayed at the lab. Thus, as Mikovitsunderstood it, there should be two copies of all data, one for the principalinvestigator, Mikovits, and one backed up on the drive at the lab. Annette evengave Mikovits the receipt for the computer in case there were any problems.The Whittemores were political contributors to US Senator Harry Reid, a Democratand the majority leader of the Senate, as well as many other politicians.15[../Text/031_Notes.html#Apfn_15] All four of Harry Reid’s sons had at one timeworked for the law firm where Harvey Whittemore was a senior partner.16[../Text/031_Notes.html#Apfn_16] In addition, Harvey Whittemore had personallyhelped advance the legal careers of two of Reid’s sons—and one of the sons, LeifReid, had become Whittemore’s personal lawyer.17[../Text/031_Notes.html#Apfn_17]In a 2006 article in the Los Angeles Times, Harvey Whittemore is quoted assaying, “You have to understand how close the Whittemore and Reid families are .. . My relationship with Sen. Reid goes back decades.”18[../Text/031_Notes.html#Apfn_18]Harvey Whittemore was often identified as one of the most politicallyinfluential individuals in the state of Nevada, earning nicknames such as “the64th legislator” for his help in drafting the state’s first business tax andbeing among a select group of four wealthy men known as the “Power Rangers,”19[../Text/031_Notes.html#Apfn_19] after the popular Saturday morning children’sshow. One reporter of Nevada state politics had quipped, “Governors come and go,but the Power Rangers stay the same.”20 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Apfn_20]Ominously, one of Harvey former associates said “Harvey Whittemore has adifferent moral compass than the rest of us.”21 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Apfn_21]One of the Whittemores’ children, their daughter Andrea, had been struck downwith ME/CFS when she was just eleven years old. Her parents were tireless intrying to find a cure for her, and through the work of Mikovits and others,Andrea—now in her thirties—was close to recovering her health. This personalconnection to the disease made Mikovits believe that she and the Whittemoreswould always be on the same side.* * *The case brought by the WPI against Mikovits was an unusual one, according toher civil attorney, Dennis Neil Jones. “The complaint alleges what I guess youcould call industrial espionage. And the defense is basically a whistleblowerkind of defense.”22 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Apfn_22]It was much different than the typical cases Jones handled. Both Jones andMikovits’s bankruptcy attorney, David Follin, would be disturbed, however, bythe legal maneuverings deployed against Mikovits. As attorneys, they understoodthe combativeness of the judicial system, but also knew there were rules and anexpected logical progression of events.But this case seemed very different from the start, in both the legal aspects,and the response of the scientific community. “It seems like the field wasstacked against Judy and it’s continued to be so. Any allegations she wasconvicted of a crime or [that] there was a successful judgment against her, iswrong,” said Follin.23 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Apfn_23] “Judy is just an amazingperson. She’s probably one of the most brilliant people I’ve ever met. All Judywants is fairness and I can’t understand how her profession can turn its back onsuch a talented individual who has so much to offer and could help so manypeople.”24 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Apfn_24]* * *When Mikovits thought about it later, she realized the problems had actuallystarted soon after Mikovits and Annette Whittemore first appeared on a TV showin 2009 called Nevada Newsmakers,25 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Apfn_25] shortlyafter the publication of the landmark article in Science linking a new humanretrovirus to ME/CFS.Mikovits and her team found evidence of the retrovirus in 68 out of 101 patients(67 percent) with CFS as compared to 8 out of 218 (3.7 percent) of healthycontrols.26 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Apfn_26] As if weren’t enough that they weretaking on a disease which had been looked upon for more than thirty years assome form of female “hysteria,” they were now planning to take on one of modernmedicine’s most controversial disease: autism.“It’s not in the paper and it’s not reported,” Mikovits said, speakinghesitantly at first, “but we’ve actually done some of these studies, and wefound the virus present in a number, in a significant number of autistic samplesthat we’ve tested so far.”The show’s host noted that this news had tremendous potential for the autismcommunity, holding out the possibility that this might lead to treatments oreven a cure. Mikovits replied by saying XMRV might be “linked to a number ofneuro-immune diseases, including autism. It certainly won’t be all because thereare genetic defects that result in autism, but there are also the environmentaleffects.”Then, barely taking a breath, she crossed the Rubicon.“There’s always the hypothesis that my child was fine, then they got sick, andthen they got autism. Interestingly, on that note, if I might speculate a littlebit . . . This might explain why vaccines lead to autism in some childrenbecause these viruses live and divide and grow in the lymphocytes, the immuneresponse cells, the B and T cells. So when you give a vaccine, you send your Band T cells in your immune cells into overdrive. That’s its job. Well, if you’reharboring one virus, and you replicate it a whole bunch, you’ve now broken thebalance between the immune response and the virus. So you could have had theunderlying virus and then amplified it with that vaccine and then set off thedisease, such that your immune system could no longer control other infectionsand created an immune deficiency.”If these children were harboring a retrovirus it wasn’t an outlandish claim tomake. It has long been established that children born to HIV-infected mothersshouldn’t be immunized until they’re on antiretroviral drugs and their testsshow the virus to be at extremely low levels. As explained at the University ofCalifornia at San Francisco web page on HIV and immunizations,Activation of the cellular immune system is important in the pathogenesis of HIVdisease, and that fact has given rise to concerns that the activation of theimmune system through vaccinations might accelerate the progression of HIVdisease . . . These observations suggest that activation of the immune systemthrough vaccinations could accelerate the progression of HIV disease throughenhanced replication . . . If feasible, it is preferable to have patients onantiretroviral therapy (ART) prior to receipt of vaccination . . .27[../Text/031_Notes.html#Apfn_27]Just as one wouldn’t want an immunization to provoke AIDS in an HIV-positivechild, one would also want to be sure a vaccination didn’t trigger autism.Mikovits and Annette Whittemore had both grabbed onto the third rail of westernscience, the question of vaccine injury and the increasing numbers of childrenwith neuro-developmental problems. The scientific community, often choosingcomfortable-yet-unproven dogma over testing controversial ideas, made thefunding of routine grant proposals even more difficult after the interview.* * *The saga of Harvey Whittemore’s Coyote Springs development had started in 1998when he purchased 43,000 acres of remote Nevada desert about an hour northeastof Las Vegas. The dry landscape was originally considered to be so barren thatits best use was thought to be a weapons test range.28[../Text/031_Notes.html#Apfn_28] One reporter referred to the single outpost ofcivilization they’d been able to build on that God-forsaken land as “The GolfCourse at the End of the World.”29 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Apfn_29]But Harvey Whittemore had big dreams. He envisioned ten golf courses as ananchor for retirees and hard-working families who wanted the good life, butcouldn’t afford Vegas prices.30 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Apfn_30] In addition tothe already built Jack Nicklaus signature course, there would eventually be159,000 housing units. If fully realized, Coyote Springs would become the secondlargest city in Nevada. But it had all fallen through as the recession of 2008started to take its toll and real estate markets across the country had bottomedout.As of 2011, none of the housing units had been built and only the single golfcourse had been completed. The writer remarked that Nicklaus’s single green golfoasis in the dry brush country of jagged edges and steep lines made it look likea vista out of the classic 1968 science fiction movie Planet of the Apes.31[../Text/031_Notes.html#Apfn_31]And yet there was something audacious about Harvey Whittemore’s ambitions, evenin light of his troubles. The reporter who dubbed it “The Golf Course at theEdge of the World” also gave what might be considered a eulogy for many ofWhittemore’s projects. After first writing that normally when one sees adevelopment gone bad you simply think the developer put his money in the wrongplace and give a figurative shrug. The developer will go onto a new project.“But a golf course—at least one made with such high levels of devotion andtalent as this one—is different.”32 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Apfn_32]* * *“You’re under arrest,” said the woman in black, slapping a pair of handcuffs onMikovits.“But it’s my laptop!” Mikovits protested.The police would take and hold for almost one year not only Mikovits’s blacklaptop, but also her iPad, iPhone, the MacBook Air she had recently purchasedfor her Ireland trip, and the silver laptop of her stepdaughter, who had beenstaying with them for a few days.“Don’t say anything!” David called out.“I won’t!” she shouted back.Four unmarked sheriff’s cars immediately came around the corner from HarborBoulevard, staging what might have looked to the casual observer like an episodeof America’s Most Wanted rather than the apprehension of a figure in ascientific controversy. Mikovits—five foot four of her, frizzy blonde hair, andjust a shade over a hundred and forty pounds—stood on the road in her whitejogging shirt and black knee-length shorts. She was shoeless, having left herflip-flops on the floor in the bathroom. One of the deputies noticed she wasbarefoot and asked if she had anything back at the house. “I was wearing myflip-flops,” she replied.An officer went into the house to retrieve her shoes.“Why am I being arrested?” Mikovits asked one of the deputies.“You are a fugitive from justice.”The arrest of Mikovits would confuse every legal expert who looked at the factsof this case for a simple reason. Nobody involved in any of these proceedingsever produced an arrest warrant. Under what law could a middle-aged scientist betaken into custody without an arrest warrant?The question would remain unanswered.* * *A deputy returned with Mikovits’s flip-flops and she was able to put them on herfeet. A sheriff’s deputy opened the back door and she was escorted into thesquad car for the eight-mile drive to the Ventura police station. At the policestation, she was taken to an interrogation room and read her Miranda rights byan officer. “Yes, I want an attorney and I’ll remain silent,” she told him.The woman who had identified herself as “Jamie,” now revealed as a member of theUniversity of Nevada, Reno campus police, was also in the interrogation room.“We’ll give you a chance to go back to Reno,” she said.One has to wonder how many times the UNR campus police have crossed the Nevadaborder to make an arrest of an adjunct professor in southern California.Mikovits wondered if the whole song and dance had been an attempt to intimidateher so that she would agree to let the WPI participate in the Lipkin study,which would represent at least a quarter of a million dollars for the WPI.Arrest her in her home, drag her back to Reno, and let her stew in a jail celluntil she agreed to let the WPI back into the Lipkin study? And if she didn’tagree, who knew what might happen to her in a Nevada jail cell?“I’m never going back to Reno,” Mikovits replied, as clearly as she could.“We’ll see about that. See ya!” the campus cop sneered. After about two hoursMikovits was taken to the Ventura County Jail, booked, and told to stand for amug shot. They gave her a thorough strip-search, including a body cavity searchfor drugs, took her only jewelry—her wedding band—her baseball cap, and herclothes, and issued her a standard prison orange jumpsuit. She tried to use herallotted phone call to reach David but outdated regulations disallowed calls toa cell phone. The only landline number she could remember was that of herlong-time collaborator Dr. Frank Ruscetti back in Maryland. Nobody was home sothe machine at his house picked up the call. Instead of allowing Mikovits tospeak all that was left on the machine was a disembodied robot-like voicesaying, “You have a call from inmate.”Later, Ruscetti recalled having no idea what to make of the crazy message.Finally she called a bail bondsman and tried to post the $100,000 bond, whichhad been levied against her. The bondsman told her with a tone of disbelief inhis voice that a “bail hold” had been placed on her case and she wouldn’t beable to be released that day. “You must really have pissed off someoneimportant,” he said.* * *“I never had a case where somebody was charged with stealing their ownresearch,” Bill Burns of 101 Bail Bonds later recounted.33[../Text/031_Notes.html#Apfn_33]When a potential client contacted Bill he usually performed a backgroundinvestigation in order to get a sense of the person. Sometimes the people whofound themselves arrested could be pretty smooth talkers, but their recordusually told the real story. Burns talked to Mikovits’s lawyer, who explainedthe nature of the dispute with the Whittemores and then he did his own research.He was quickly able to find out she had no criminal history, that she was awell-regarded scientist, and her husband David Nolde had also never been introuble with the law.A picture of his new client began to form in his mind. He had seen a similarscenario several times before—whether it was an overzealous district attorneyunfairly prosecuting somebody or when a wealthy individual had influence andknew how to make another person’s life miserable. The information he gatheredabout Mikovits in a short period of time convinced him that something wasdefinitely out of whack.“A lot of people suffer from this illusion of how great our legal system is,”Burns later recounted, “and it really isn’t great. You talk about third worldcountries. You could feel like you’re in a third world country when you’relocked up and trying to get out. You can’t use the phone. You don’t have theability to mount a defense. It’s amazing in a country of this size that a lot ofpeople get screwed very badly in our system. It’s very easy to end up losingeverything on a case that shouldn’t have even been brought.”Determining if a potential client was trustworthy was important to Burn’sbusiness. Bail bonds don’t get exonerated until the case is resolved, whetherthat takes two months or two years. The bail for Mikovits was one hundredthousand dollars, which meant she would put up 10 percent of that money upfront. Burns would normally take a lien on her house or other property ascollateral for the bond, but in this case he didn’t have Mikovits or David Noldesign over anything as collateral.“I did a hundred thousand on a signature because I thought not only was the casefull of shit, but everything about it was wrong,” he later said.* * *There were three holding cells in the basement of the Ventura County Courthouse.The cells were six-by-eight feet, with a three-foot-long steel bench, a smallwall, and on the other side a steel commode, unfortunately without any toiletpaper. The guards would alternate which cell a new prisoner would be put in,usually about five to a cell. When it was full or the hour was late, the groupof prisoners would be taken to the new Ventura County facility down the road.Many of the people in the holding cell were picked up that day for drug offensesor driving under the influence. For some of the prisoners it was their“appointment time” to serve all or part of their sentence. These were peoplewhose cases had already been heard, and due to the overcrowding of the jails andthe relative minor nature of their offense, would serve just a few days.Shortly after Mikovits arrived in her cell, a woman named Karen (pseudonym),entered to serve her appointment time. She worked for a local newspaper,managing several of the vehicles, which made early morning deliveries. She hadbeen picked up on a minor drug possession charge, was convicted, and as she toldMikovits, just wanted to put the mistake behind her and get it over with. Otherswere a little more frightening. One woman came in, teetering on six-inch heels,her hair eighteen different shades of the rainbow, clearly picked up for drugs.Karen and Judy exchanged thankful looks that she hadn’t been put in their cell.As the hours passed the cells continued to fill up, with some of them apparentlyregulars; they would warmly greet their fellow inmates or guards as they wereprocessed in. At some point, one of the prisoners asked if any of them werefirst-timers.“I am,” said Mikovits.* * *In the late evening, probably around ten or eleven, Ruth (pseudonym), adistraught woman in her mid-fifties, was brought into the jail. She was coughingand crying at the same time and lamenting that this was all a mistake. In thesix or seven hours Mikovits had been in the holding cell she had learned alittle about jail psychology: one didn’t look directly at people and one keptone’s head down. Everybody else was avoiding looking at Ruth as well.“This is all wrong! This is a mistake!” cried Ruth. “I shouldn’t be here! Ishould be home!” Mikovits knew just how she felt.* * *When Dr. Jamie Deckoff-Jones read the October 9, 2009, Science article byMikovits and her team shortly after its publication, she looked up at herhusband and said, “This is it. This is what we’ve got.”34[../Text/031_Notes.html#Apfn_34]Deckoff-Jones was a graduate of Harvard and Albert Einstein College of Medicineand a board-certified emergency physician. Her father was a brilliant man andlegendary surgeon, who graduated magna cum laude from Yale and finished HarvardMedical School at the age of twenty-one. Deckoff-Jones traced the beginning ofher own neurological downfall to a series of hepatitis B shots she received whenshe was pregnant with her third child. She also often wondered about the sugarcube polio vaccine she received in 1961.35 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Apfn_35]Her symptoms waxed and waned over the years and she believed the constellationof her symptoms most closely resembled some sort of combination of Lyme diseaseand multiple sclerosis. Her daughter came down with ME/CFS when she was thirteenyears old and around the same time her husband came down with Lyme carditis, aheart condition associated with Lyme disease.In January of 2010 she wrote to Mikovits and was amazed at the lengthy emailsMikovits wrote in response to her questions as well as her openness andinclusiveness. As their relationship grew, Deckoff-Jones took over the role ofanswering much of Mikovits’s email questions from patients. It wasDeckoff-Jones’s opinion that Mikovits was spending so much time responding topatient emails that it was limiting the amount of scientific work she couldaccomplish in a day.Deckoff-Jones eventually came on as the clinical director of the WPI. Herrelationship with the Whittemores quickly soured. Deckoff-Jones believed theproblems arose because of Annette’s inability to admit what she didn’t know andprotect her staff. Eventually Harvey took over as the person at the WPI to whomDeckoff-Jones directly reported. She found Harvey to be a smart man andgenerally easy to work with but he had his breaking point.36[../Text/031_Notes.html#Apfn_36]In a text she sent to Harvey, she used the word “nepotism” to describe manyhighly-placed individuals who worked at the WPI, like Carli West Kinne, legalcounsel for the WPI, and Kellen Monick-Jones, the patient coordinator for theWPI, both Whittemore nieces. Other examples included not just relatives, butothers who had long-standing personal or professional ties with the Whittemores.“Now you’ve really lit my fuse,” Harvey wrote back in a text after the“nepotism” comment. Shortly after that, Annette Whittemore informedDeckoff-Jones they were going to have to shelve their plans for a clinic and herservices wouldn’t be needed. They had had conflicts over other issues as well,such as whether the clinic should treat kids with autism. Deckoff-Jones wantedto treat them, but believed Annette saw far too many problems with such aneffort.37 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Apfn_37]For Deckoff-Jones, Mikovits’s story is important in that Mikovits was likePandora, opening a forbidden box. “She made mistakes like everybody in thestory. Me, everybody. An incredible opportunity has been lost as a result. Butit’s mostly Harvey and Annette’s fault. Judy never had a chance. They neversupported her. She didn’t have what she needed to pull it off. Ever. It was ajoke.”38 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Apfn_38]* * *Around two a.m. the day after her arrest, Mikovits was driven to the Todd RoadFacility located in a lemon orchard about ten miles out of the city of Ventura.Upon being admitted to the facility, she was again required to strip, bend over,and submit to being cavity searched for drugs. Mikovits was given several piecesof paper with directions on how to be a model prisoner, but because she didn’thave her reading glasses couldn’t make out the words. When she complained to aguard about her need for reading glasses, the guard replied, “This isn’t aresort. That’s why they call it jail.” Apparently a model prisoner didn’t “needto read.”At one point during her processing, Mikovits was asked if she was suicidal.“No,” she replied.Even with her clear answer, Mikovits was placed in the suicide watch wing. Thesuicide watch wing was regularly used for people who were being arrested for thefirst time. It seemed that being arrested and placed in jail for the first timewas such an overwhelming experience for the average person that it was presumedto make them suicidal. The light in the suicide watch cell was on the entirenight, which allowed the guards to constantly monitor the prisoners for anysigns of abnormal behavior. Mikovits’s cellmate was a woman, Marie (pseudonym),who was undergoing treatment for a methamphetamine addiction. Because Marie wastaking several powerful drugs to break her addiction and was thus at risk offalling out of bed, Mikovits was required to take the top bunk.The cell was made of thick cinder block. The cell was about four feet wide, hada bottom and top bunk made of steel, a commode and sink attached to the wall,and a small window at the top. Instead of bars across the front entrance, therewas a thick steel door with a small rectangular window. When the steel doorclosed, sealing her in, Mikovits felt as if she was in a tomb. The opening andclosing of the heavy doors all night sent shivers through Mikovits. She couldnever have imagined herself in such a place. For a mattress, they were given theequivalent of an exercise mat and no pillow since they were in the suicide watchcell. Marie explained to Mikovits how to put her foot on one side of the smallsink to climb into the top bunk. Upon making it to the upper bunk, Mikovits wasgreeted by the fluorescent, oblong light, which never went off.Mikovits thought about one particular day in the WPI shortly after she hadreturned from the Invest in ME conference in England in May of 2011, when Harveyhad stormed into her office. He shouted at her because he thought she hadinsulted Annette’s efforts to reach out to another ME/CFS charity. Mikovits haddone nothing of the sort but Harvey demanded, “You’re going to go and apologizeto Annette!”“Okay! Okay!” Mikovits replied, hoping to defuse the situation.Harvey’s booming voice had no doubt been overheard by other staff members, butas they left Mikovits’s office, he put on a big smile and slid his arm aroundher shoulder. But his hand didn’t reach all the way to her shoulder, stoppinginstead at the back of her neck, where it would be concealed by hershoulder-length blonde hair. As he walked past employees of UNR, all smiles andfriendliness, Mikovits felt his hand squeezing the back of her neck so hard shethought it would leave bruises. To Mikovits, the message was unmistakable: shefelt like he was saying he could end her at any time he wanted and all of thesepeople he supported wouldn’t raise a voice in protest.Harvey pulled the same little neck-squeeze trick on Mikovits in August of 2011when they’d been leaving a restaurant with a representative of a drug companythat Mikovits had introduced to the Whittemores. Harvey was hoping the companywould initiate a clinical trial of a new drug therapy with the WPI and providesignificant financing. Mikovits had been unusually quiet during the evening, andby the end of the meal the company had decided not to collaborate.Since that time, Mikovits had been plagued by a recurring nightmare in which shewas driving with friends of hers, having a great time, laughing and talking,when Harvey Whittemore suddenly sat up in the back seat, reached his long armaround her neck, and started strangling her. The metaphor was clear, he could doanything to her and she could not scream.That first night in jail, Mikovits didn’t worry about her own safety. Shebelieved that Harvey’s plan had been to get her back to Reno and she knew thenotebooks containing evidence had been secured by Max.Who knew what was planned for her in Nevada?But no matter how long his arms, Mikovits doubted Harvey could reach all the wayfrom Reno, Nevada, to her jail cell in Ventura, California. It was ironic, butshe felt safer in a cell with a recovering methamphetamine addict than she hadfelt in months.* * *Mikovits let her thoughts wander to Dr. John Coffin, whom many saw as the grandold man of virology, and his quote in Science comparing her to Joan of Arc.Science at the highest levels is a territorial game of power. In many cases, ifa young person discovers a novel finding in someone else’s turf, theself-appointed head of that domain writes the second paper and first reviewarticle and effectively squeezes the young person out. Coffin had actuallywritten an editorial in support of her original article in the journal Scienceentitled “A New Virus for Old Diseases.”39 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Apfn_39] Nowhe was on the other side.Who Mikovits wondered, compared a fellow researcher to Joan of Arc, a fourteenthcentury warrior saint unjustly accused of heresy, and prophesized, “Thescientists will burn her at the stake”: It was a ludicrous statement. Why shoulda scientist be burnt at the stake for publishing data that might turn out to bewrong? In the 1970s many papers were published falsely claiming the discovery ofhuman disease-causing retroviruses. None of these people were burnt at thestake, some of them were elected to the National Academy. Was Coffin comparingthe scientific community to the agents of the Inquisition? How might they feelabout such a comparison? If her research turned out to be incorrect, letsomebody else run the same experiments and disprove her. That was the wayscience went. People can be right one day and wrong the next. She could acceptthat. Coffin had been wrong about human retroviruses. Had he ended up in jail?Disgraced? No. There was so much more to this story.But as much as she thought Coffin had acted inappropriately in many instances,she also felt that a great many of her problems stemmed from her former allies,the Whittemores. She believed that the recession had badly hurt the Whittemore’sreal estate holdings but also wondered if others with far more power might beforcing them to act against their natural inclinations.But why would anybody not be interested in helping the millions of patients withME/CFS and children with autism?* * *Even with all that had happened, as Mikovits lay in her bunk, she found herselftrying to pray for the Whittemores. Mikovits had genuinely liked them. Many ofher friends believed her downfall was due to her misplaced loyalty towards theWhittemores, maybe an emotional naiveté, an inability to tell when people weremanipulating her. But there was no doubt that since the 1984–1985 outbreak ofME/CFS at Lake Tahoe, no other individual or group had done more to focusattention on this horrible disease than the WPI.The poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow once wrote, “If we could read the secrethistory of our enemies, we should find in each man’s life sorrow and sufferingenough to disarm all hostility.” It was in this vein that Mikovits thought ofthe Whittemores as she sat in her jail cell.Mikovits believed Annette was in over her head with the WPI, but she was aparent fighting for her child’s life. She felt that so many things had conspiredagainst them but especially the economy and not fully understanding how much thegovernment wanted to avoid taking an honest look at ME/CFS or autism and therole vaccines might play. Mikovits tried to leave these thoughts behind andconcentrate on something more elevated. She struggled to remember the words ofcertain Biblical verses she had heard over the years at church but couldn’trecall any. It bothered her because she really wanted, needed, to pray.Only the words to the Lord’s Prayer came to her. She began reciting it over andover, almost like a mantra, and it gave her a feeling of great peace as shefaced the uncertain night ahead.Our Father who art in Heaven,Hallowed be thy name;Thy kingdom comeThy will be doneOn Earth as it is in Heaven.Give us this day our daily bread;And forgive us our trespassesAs we forgive those who trespass against us;And lead us not into temptationBut deliver us from evil.“Act, and God will act,” Joan of Arc had once said. Despite all the times shehad acted before and it had come to nothing, Mikovits thought she would try onceagain."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONEThe HHV-6 Conference and the Culture of ScienceIn science there is—maybe—more self-interest, a little more paranoia, a littlemore narcissism, or else why do we go into it? You think you are good enough tosolve problems of nature. Many scientists tend to keep things to themselves. Ifthe other person does not get funded, maybe you will be funded. All these thingsare in play, but these are the worst elements of science or scientists.—Dr. Robert Gallo.1 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach1fn_40]Barcelona, Spain—May 1, 2006Judy Mikovits searched for a seat just barely within earshot distance of thekeynote speech of Dr. Robert Gallo2 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach1fn_41] at the5th International Conference on HHV-6 and -7 (human herpes viruses 6 and 7).Gallo was speaking in the stately grand ballroom at the Hilton Diagonal MarHotel in Barcelona, Spain. She hoped to fade into the diffuse lighting andsubtle European accents of the room. Mikovits knew from previous encounters thatshe wanted to stay far away from the famed scientist.Gallo was there to speak about human herpes virus number 6, which had beencodiscovered in his lab in 1986 by Dr. Dharam Ablashi.3[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach1fn_42] Ablashi was also the program’s committeechair of this conference dedicated to the HHV-6 virus and its possibleconnection to ME/CFS and other disorders.Many Americans still consider Gallo to be the scientist who discovered the HumanImmunodeficiency Virus (HIV), which causes Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome(AIDS). The World Health Organization estimates that since the known onset ofthe AIDS epidemic in the early 1980s, 70 million people have become infectedwith the HIV virus and about 30 million have died from the complications ofAIDS,4 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach1fn_43] making it the greatest pandemic of themodern era and ensuring a place among the Louis Pasteurs and Jonas Salks ofhistory for those at the forefront of HIV research, hence the ferocious fightamong the participants for credit. Gallo’s biography at the Institute of HumanVirology at the University of Maryland, which he founded and still directs,claims he is “best known for his codiscovery of HIV.”5[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach1fn_44] However, when the Nobel Prize committeeawarded the Nobel Prize in 2008 for the discovery of HIV to French scientists,Luc Montagnier and Françoise Barré-Sinoussi, Gallo’s name was conspicuouslyabsent.One can’t doubt the ascendant accolades and recognition Gallo has receivedduring his scientific career. Gallo holds an enviable twenty-nine honorarydoctorates. In 1982 and 1986, he received the most prestigious Americanscientific award, the Lasker Prize, which is often called the American NobelPrize for medical research. Gallo is the author of 1,200-plus scientificpublications, and he authored the book, Virus Hunting—AIDS, Cancer & the HumanRetrovirus: A Story of Scientific Discovery. According to Gallo’s own account,he decided to devote his life to science after the untimely death of his youngersister at the age of six from leukemia.6 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach1fn_45] Hisstory is an archetypal tale in science and medicine: those personally touched byan illness often want to conquer or cure it. His career choice seemed to be hisnatural métier. Judy Mikovits made a similar decision to enter science afterwatching her beloved grandfather die of cancer, and later on her stepfathersuffered the same fate.The dispute over who actually discovered the HIV retrovirus, whether it wasGallo or a French team led by Luc Montagnier, became so heated that in 1987 itrequired intervention by US President Ronald Reagan and the French PresidentJacques Chirac.7 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach1fn_46] The truce was struck whenGallo conceded he likely used the French HIV isolate to develop the test andallowed both Gallo and Montagnier to claim credit as “codiscoverers” of theretrovirus. These events likely marked the first time in history that credit fora scientific discovery has been decided by two heads of state.Pulitzer-prize winning journalist John Crewdson of the Chicago Tribune wasparamount among Gallo’s early HIV critics. In several articles over a three-yearperiod, Crewdson scrutinized many of Gallo’s claims about his role in thediscovery of the HIV retrovirus. Crewdson’s investigative reporting culminatedin a book-length special supplement to the Tribune of 55,000 words in Novemberof 1988, entitled “The Great AIDS Quest”.8 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach1fn_47] Ina later article in 1992, the Chicago Tribune’s public editor Douglas Kneelandsummarized Crewdon’s conclusions and the unresolved controversy:9[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach1fn_48] After noting that Gallo’s lab had notdiscovered the AIDS virus as they long claimed, they had benefited from theresulting test.As a result, the United States has collected $20 million in patent royaltiesover the years from an AIDS test Gallo developed by using what even he nowacknowledges was the French virus [emphasis added].Kneeland finished his lengthy editorial by reflecting on what this investigationof high-profile science exposed about the pitfalls of money, ambition, andcontroversy.This case was not of abiding importance because it was typical. It was not. Butas a worst-case example, it tells us about the treacherous quicksands greed andambition place in the path of even professional truth-tellers in the scientificresearch community. And it shows too well what happens when politicians,bureaucrats, lawyers and marketers get too close to science.Mikovits found that many of the same criticisms would be just as applicable toher investigation of the XMRV retrovirus and ME/CFS, her own version of“treacherous quicksands” that would entrap her in distortions and legal battles.But she was nothing like Robert Gallo.She had seen the illustrious scientist at close range at the very beginning ofher scientific career and did not want to imitate him.* * *Three years of investigation by the Federal Office of Research Integrityculminated in a report they released on December 30, 1992,10[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach1fn_49] which found that Gallo had committed“scientific misconduct.” Gallo vigorously and vocally disputed the findings.However, on July 11, 1994, the Department of Health and Human Services stated “.. . a virus provided by the Institut Pasteur was used by the National Instituteof Health scientists who invented the American HIV test kit in 1984” andpromised the French $6 million dollars in restitution.11[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach1fn_50]Shortly after this acknowledgment, Gallo left the NIH for a position at theUniversity of Maryland. The Chicago Tribune reporter, John Crewdson, would laterturn the condemnatory information against Gallo into a 670-page book, ScienceFictions: A Scientific Mystery, a Massive Cover-up, and the Dark Legacy ofRobert Gallo, which would be published in March of 2002.12[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach1fn_51]However, it wasn’t as if Gallo had contributed nothing to the field ofretroviral research or had never taken risky positions. He had pushed thescience further, demonstrating that the HIV virus caused AIDS, using a techniquedeveloped in Gallo’s lab by Frank Ruscetti for growing T-cells—an immuneresponse cell which the virus was found to infect. He had also been among thefew who took the renegade position that a retrovirus could cause human cancer ata time when it had been almost laughable to believe such a thing. Right beforeAIDS, cancer was the most feared national disease, and he seemed willing to takeon a fearsome challenge.The scientists involved in the presidential dispute over HIV had also seeminglymade peace with each other. When Montagnier was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2008,he wrote a gracious statement that Gallo was equally deserving of the award.13[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach1fn_52] The two would later collaborate on severalpapers regarding the scientific history of the AIDS epidemic.Maria Masucci, a member of the Nobel Assembly, had another take, telling the NewYork Times shortly after the awards were given, “there was no doubt as to whomade the fundamental discoveries.”14 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach1fn_53]* * *The temporary truce between the two giants of retrovirology would deterioratesoon enough. Ironically the break would not be over HIV/AIDS, but rather overautism. Despite collaborating on the greatest pandemic of modern history, thewinds between Gallo and Montagnier shifted dramatically around this other,underdog epidemic.On June 4, 2012, Gallo wrote a letter to the Chantal Biya InternationalReference Center, an AIDS research center in the central African nation ofCameroon, calling for Montagnier to be removed from his part-time position asscientific director. Gallo was joined in this effort by several others who—likeMontagnier—were Nobel Prize winners.A June 19, 2012, article in Nature recounted Gallo’s efforts and Montagnier’sresponse15 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach1fn_54]:Montagnier deplores what he describes as “ad hominem attacks” and “plain lies”,and says that there is an “ignominious campaign” against him and his group. Hesays that history is full of pioneers whose ideas were at first given a chillyreception by a conservative research community. “I believe this is happeningagain to me, and it is very sad that it involves Nobel Prize laureates attackinga fellow laureate,” he says.The Nature article went on to detail what seems to have been the “last straw”justifying the efforts to remove Montagnier, his appearance at Autism One, aconference of autism parents and researchers in the field. Montagnier’s theorywas that abnormal bacteria were causing at least some of the symptoms of autism,and that long-term treatment with antibiotics might be helpful. But it seemedhis greatest crime was in listening to autism parents describe what happened totheir children.He says that he has never argued that vaccination could cause autism. “Manyparents have observed a temporal association, which does not mean causation,between a vaccination and the appearance of autism symptoms,” he says.“Presumably vaccination, especially against multiple antigens, could be atrigger of a pre-existing pathological situation in some children.”16[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach1fn_55]Parents of children with autism were understandably frustrated that thescientific community disregarded that some of them noticed their children’ssymptoms worsened or that health problems began shortly after the child wasvaccinated.Like Montagnier, Mikovits was not into arbitrary social divisions: she didn’tlike being told who to shun. She felt parents tended to be honest and accuratereporters about their own children. If she wanted to talk to an autism parent,she was going to talk to an autism parent. Being an aisle-crosser just didn’talways make her popular amongst spotlight-grabbers.One of the greatest thrills of her professional life came when she delivered aspeech immediately following Montagnier, and the Nobel Prize winner directed thediscussion toward her presentation and its ramifications. Then in a privateconversation following the presentation, Montagnier commented on the XMRVcontroversy, compared it to his own battle with Gallo over HIV, and told her,“Don’t let the critics get you down.”* * *Dr. Frank Ruscetti, Mikovits’s mentor and long-time collaborator, was inclinedto take a less charitable view of Gallo than Montagnier had offered on themorning he won the Nobel Prize. Ruscetti had seen Robert Gallo at close range,working in his lab from 1975 to 1982. Dr. Kendall Smith, a professor of medicineand immunology at Cornell University, recalled meeting Ruscetti during thoseearly years at Gallo’s lab as he worked on interleukin-2(IL-2), a proteinmolecule that regulates the body’s immune system, saying, “I always describe himas a cross between Leonardo Da Vinci and Rocky Marciano, because he is truly apure intellectual, probably the most well-read scientist I know, and he neverpulls punches.”17 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach1fn_56]Even before he joined her in later battles, Mikovits agreed that Ruscetti wasone of the most brilliant, well-rounded men she had ever met. She saw him asboth honest and incorruptible. These qualities and Mikovits’s appreciation ofthem would form the basis of a more than thirty-year collaboration andfriendship. Mikovits proclaimed that nobody on Earth knew her as well as FrankRuscetti, as he had the soul-peering ability of an honestly-lived life.18[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach1fn_57]Smith’s fond memories of Frank Ruscetti stand in sharp contrast to what he toldthe reporter Seth Roberts of Spy magazine in 1990 about Robert Gallo’s reactionto his work:When, in 1988, Kendall Smith published a paper in the prestigious journalScience that accurately described the discovery of IL-2, Gallo was infuriatedand phoned Smith from an AIDS conference in Stockholm. “Kendall, I haven’t readit, but people tell me you were not nice to me.” (It is a peculiar habit ofGallo’s to claim he hasn’t read or seen or heard whatever he is vociferouslycriticizing.)19 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach1fn_58]The article in Spy magazine also provided an account of the discovery of HTLV-1,the first known human retrovirus. It highlighted Gallo’s reaction, and FrankRuscetti’s response to Gallo’s attempt to take credit.In 1978, Bernie Poiesz arrived at the Gallo lab for a postdoctoral fellowshipand was put under the tutelage of Ruscetti. For years Gallo’s lab had beenlooking for retroviruses that infected myeloid cells, as retroviruses were knownto cause cancer in animals. Researchers wondered whether they could do the samein humans.20 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach1fn_59] With Ruscetti’s help, Poieszfound a retrovirus within months, and the two of them planned to publish anarticle on the discovery. Then Gallo called Ruscetti down to his office andsuggested Poiesz be taken off as first author. Ruscetti refused. Gallo told himhe was unlikely to get far in life with an attitude like that.Poiesz compares the discovery of HTLV-1 to the Celtics winning an NBAchampionship; Poiesz was like Larry Bird; Ruscetti was like the coach; and Gallowas like the general manager. Yet in the decade that followed, Gallo, who hadnot done any lab work for years, received almost all the credit.Although Mikovits would never work directly under Gallo, she found herselflocking horns with Gallo and NIH officials at her very first research job, andlike Ruscetti she would not back down.* * *“Science is a very difficult thing to do well,” said Frank Ruscetti in 2013,reflecting on his research career of more than forty years and experience as thesenior investigator and head of the Leukocyte Biology Section in the Laboratoryof Experimental Immunology at the National Cancer Institute.21[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach1fn_60] “And there are two ways to get ahead. You canstruggle in the lab, work your tail off, and get some publications. The problemwith that approach is that it’s a profession, which relies on the integrity ofindividuals to be anonymous. Anonymous in getting funding, anonymous inreviewing manuscripts, and that anonymity depends on the integrity of theindividual.”22 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach1fn_61]In Ruscetti’s opinion, Gallo’s brand of ruthless jockeying is common inresearch, as many scientists become intoxicated by scientific celebrity andquickly throw away their integrity. As in any field, science could involvesubstantial social networking and favoritism. “Then there are a group ofscientists who believe it’s never important to be first, but to be second andthird and write the first review article,” said Ruscetti. Those scientists willthen “use political connections to convince the world they’re great. Andunfortunately, our field is full of people like that. And they tend to be themore famous ones.”23 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach1fn_62]Ruscetti recalled an incident in the early 1980s when he went to see two leadingscientists about obtaining some HIV samples for research. The scientists werehappy to share the samples, but one couldn’t stop talking about how much hehoped this research would land him a spot on The Tonight Show with JohnnyCarson. To Ruscetti, there seemed to be to be a lust for the limelight, a GreatMan complex, when in truth science should be a collaborative process. InRuscetti’s view, this thirst for personal glory and recognition threatened thepurity of science.24 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach1fn_63]* * *Mikovits had entered her early professional life with enthusiasticdetermination. She graduated from the University of Virginia in May of 1980 witha BA in biological chemistry. She was the only one of the four children in herfamily to go to a four-year university.25 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach1fn_64]Recognizing her promise, Anne Harpe Peabody, a high school English teacher atJeb Stuart High in Falls Church, Virginia, was instrumental in getting Mikovitsthe financial aid to attend.Right before Mikovits’s graduation from college, TIME Magazine ran a cover storyon March 30, 1980, about the discovery of interferon, which held the possibilityof being a cure for cancer. From the day her grandfather had died several yearsearlier of cancer, Mikovits promised him and herself that this disease would notdevastate other families as it had done hers. As with Gallo, her familialhistory of disease had thrust her into cancer research with a sense of calling.She also didn’t want to waste any time getting started. On the Sunday followinggraduation, she saw an job listing in the Washington Post for a protein chemistto purify interferon as a biological treatment against kidney cancer in a labcontracted under the NCI in Frederick, Maryland. She applied for the job andlanded it.In 1982, Gallo contracted to Mikovits and her colleagues the task of purifyingHTLV-1 retrovirus from infected cells grown in 250-liter fermentors using acontinuous flow centrifuge. But there were risky issues with his methodology.Mikovits and her supervisor felt that the growing conditions for the retroviruswere unsafe for the lab workers, especially since there were several pregnantyoung women on staff.26 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach1fn_65] The hazards to adeveloping fetus were at that time unknown and they wanted more safeguards.According to Mikovits, they brought these concerns to the supervisors, who wereunbending and demanded that they go ahead and grow the retrovirus or sacrificetheir jobs. Mikovits and her boss decided to do the work around-the-clock bythemselves and still managed to complete the project on time, not putting anypregnant workers in harm’s way.A few months later, Mikovits received a letter from her boss that the NCI nolonger needed a protein chemist to purify interferon. She couldn’t help but feelthat the same dysfunctional environment that allowed Gallo to thrive was nowturned against her as payback because she was a twenty-four-year-old labtechnician who dared to challenge a lionized scientist. The guardians of publichealth had shown reckless disregard for the well-being of their own lab workers,even pregnant women, handling a poorly understood pathogen. What did this sayabout their concern for the rest of the public?After her position was “eliminated,” she attended a seminar given by Dr. JoostJ. Oppenheim. After his engrossing talk, she approached Oppenheim to discuss hiscurrent research.27 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach1fn_66] He invited her to hisoffice, and when she mentioned her position at the NCI lab had ended hesuggested she talk to Frank Ruscetti, who Oppenheim had just hired as aprincipal investigator in his laboratory.Mikovits was certain after the fact that she had blown the Ruscetti interviewbut had actually left quite a favorable impression with the scientist. WhenRuscetti went to notify the personnel director to hire Mikovits he was told no,with the rationale that Mikovits “was a troublemaker.”“How is she a troublemaker?” Ruscetti queried.“She asks too many questions.”“But she’s a scientist!” he replied with outrage. “It’s her job to askquestions!” That settled it for him. Ruscetti insisted that they hire Mikovitsand won his battle.A few months later, Mikovits got a call from Robert Gallo, followed by Vince DeVita, who was head of the NCI. They wanted to take a look at a paper Ruscettiwas writing confirming the isolation of HIV from blood and body fluids. Ruscettiwas attending an overseas scientific convention in Europe at the time and thuscould not weigh in.Since Mikovits did not hold authorship, she told them she could not ethicallygive the paper to them. They threatened then to fire her for insubordination.(“Insubordination” seems to be a recurring theme in the ongoing career ofMikovits, earning respect from her supporters and angering her critics).Mikovits told Gallo and DeVita she wasn’t going to hand over the paper. Mikovitschallenged them to go ahead and fire her. When Frank returned from Europe andlearned what she had done, he was incredulous. “You did that for me?” he asked.The stress of the past few weeks and the fear that she could be fired for asecond time for standing up to powerful men got the better of her, and sheangrily lashed out. “I didn’t do it for you! I did it because it was the rightthing to do!”28 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach1fn_67] Ruscetti was impressed andbemused by the brassy courage of his young protégé. This was clearly a veryspecial young woman.Shortly after Mikovits told Ruscetti what had happened in his absence, he got acall from Gallo. “You know, Frank, the NIH can’t afford to have two differentlabs discovering this. You have to send me your virus to make sure it’s the sameas my virus.”But Ruscetti had been down too many dark alleys with Gallo to enter his circleof trust. Ruscetti replied, “Well, thanks, but no thanks. Congratulations onconfirming the isolation. But I’m going to flush my virus down the toilet ratherthan give it to you.”Ruscetti would later observe that there were a number of dominant people inscience who believed things were true simply because they spoke with anauthoritative utterance. Their underlings lived in fear of them because of howthey could change the trajectory of a researcher’s career. Unfortunately, acommanding phrase could take on a life of its own, outlasting even itsdefinitive disproof, which was how some dominant figures rose to the upperechelon of the scientific hierarchy in Ruscetti’s estimation.“Gallo’s a classic example,” said Ruscetti. “Unfortunately, there are a lot ofpeople like him in science.”29 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach1fn_68]* * *When Gallo hit a crosswind several years later regarding his claim to havediscovered the HIV retrovirus before Montagnier and Barré-Sinousi, Mikovits andRuscetti weren’t exactly surprised to see him sputtering against a backlash.However, there was no such controversy surrounding the discovery of humanherpes-virus #6 (HHV-6). The dispute surrounding HHV-6 would be about itspossible connection to various debilitating or deadly human diseases. Working atGallo’s lab a few years after Ruscetti had left, Drs. Syed Zaki Salahuddin andDharam Ablashi first reported the isolation of the virus.30[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach1fn_69] Pictures of white blood cells which hadswelled (earning the nickname “juicy cells”), showed they had been infected bythe virus. These findings were published in the journal Science in October of1986. The infected cells appeared to be B cells, but the virus also seemed totarget T-4 lymphocytes (otherwise known as CD4 cells, a key part of the immunesystem).Patients with AIDS soon tested positive for the newly discovered herpes virus,which may not have been initially groundbreaking since AIDS patients testedpositive for numerous opportunistic infections including others in the herpesvirus family. Then reports filtered in to Gallo, Salahuddin, and Ablashi thatthe so-called “juicy cells” were seen in other patients with unrelated immunesystem disorders including young children with seizures as well as adults andchildren with blood disorders, kidney problems, or ME/CFS.31[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach1fn_70] Of course, this raised the question of whatcausal factors could create commonality in these seemingly disparate hits to theimmune system, and which virus or retrovirus was the driver (and which ones werepassengers).Even after more than twenty years, the question remains unanswered whether theHHV-6 virus lies at the heart of many serious diseases or whether it is justanother telltale indicator of an even more elusive pathogen or type of pathogenwhich is decimating the immune system of its victims and leading thereactivation of dormant bugs or invasion by new bugs.However, with AIDS, the one-two punch of HIV and its coinfections becametextbook information: HIV compromised the immune system, leading to secondaryopportunistic infections. To treat AIDS, antiretroviral drugs had to be used asprimary treatment, with treatment for secondary infections as a next line ofcourse, because this was the way to deal with the one-two punch.Treating opportunistic infections alone, in the early years of AIDS, hadresulted in gravely shortened lifespans and massive carnage, even when it didprolong life.* * *In late 2005, Mikovits was smiling and at ease in one of her favorite spots:tending bar at the Pierpont Bay Yacht Club (PBYC) in the Ventura Harbor inVentura, California, not far from the beach house she shared with her husband,David.32 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach1fn_71] There were no membership feesrequired to join the club and annual dues were minimal, giving the club aclass-straddling joviality unreachable in many similar places. However, thesmall dues required that the facility run on volunteerism. Members were requiredto partake in various duties at the clubhouse at least once a year.Judy and David Nolde did much more than the minimal duties. In addition to beingrear commodore of the yacht club, Nolde (among their friends she is known asJudy Nolde, while professionally she retains the Mikovits name) liked filling inregularly as the bartender. The job allowed her to open up the club in the lateafternoon or in early evening, pour beer and wine, clear her mind with the heftof a pinot noir in one hand, and connect with a diverse group of people. Sheloved the relaxed banter, hearing about the struggles and obstacles people hadovercome. If asked, she would freely share tales of her own life.She regaled the patrons with stories about her more than twenty years working atthe National Cancer Institute in Maryland. Or, if they were in the mood forromance, she told them about meeting David at a conference in Ventura in 1999,getting married at the age of forty-two, commuting for a few months between theNCI on the East Coast and David’s home in Ventura, and finally deciding that ifshe wanted a real marriage she needed to be in the same time zone as herhusband. It was his gentle magnetism that brought her there, to a place where anaccomplished scientist might be found tending bar at an egalitarian yacht club.To be nearer to David, she got a job as director of cancer research with abiotech start-up in Santa Barbara called EpiGenX Pharmaceuticals, which wasdeveloping drugs to regulate tumor suppressor genes, leading to more effectiveoutcomes for cancer treatment. The drugs they were developing decreased DNAmethylation (increased DNA methylation caused silencing of gene expression),which normally becomes disrupted as cancer spread through the body, thus causingfurther downstream damage. The intellectual property for the company waslicensed out of the University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB) and Judywas intimately involved in the construction of the lab EpiGenX built, as well assecuring two SBIR grants from the NIH.33 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach1fn_72]The company had floundered in the wake of the sluggish economic climate after9/11. In the spring of 2005, it was in the process of being bought out by alarger company. EpiGenX had generated a fair amount of its own intellectualproperty, but with no funding to pay employees, Mikovits was the only actual labemployee left. She would still go into the lab every day and run experiments,but the company had also put her in charge of handling due diligence for theupcoming sale, which took a few hours every day. Mikovits knew that when thesale went through she would in all likelihood need to look for a new job.The sale wouldn’t take place for several months, so on one Friday evening inlate 2005, Judy found herself working behind the bar when then vice-commodore ofPBYC, Joe Vetrano, walked in with his new girlfriend, Karen, an accountant. Itwould prove to be a moment of serendipity, with Judy’s candor working in herfavor. The three of them chatted for a while and Karen started to talk about herboss, who had a daughter tragically sick with an illness believed to be causedby a human herpes virus HHV-6. Judy was intrigued as Karen conveyed thesubstantial level of impairment and suffering of her boss’s child. Karen’s boss,Kristin Loomis, had started an organization to go after the virus, called theHHV-6 Foundation. After Karen had talked for several minutes and Judy excitedlyasked a few questions, Joe initiated, off-handedly, “Judy, maybe you could helpthem.”“Yes, Joe, why not—I’ll check it out,” she replied with a grin, taking awaytheir finished drinks.* * *Ken Richards joined EpiGenX in September of 2000, as chief financial officer,and recalled recruiting Mikovits from the NCI in May of 2001.34[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach1fn_73] Ken was originally from Canada, having workedfor seventeen years for a Canadian corporate investment bank before transferringwith them to Los Angeles in 1997. He was surprised as a savvy money-man to findthat the University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB) had a phenomenalscience and engineering program, but no systematic way to bring their researchdiscoveries to market. Richards and two other ambitious partners founded theSanta Barbara chapter of Tech Coast Angels, the largest angel funding network inthe United States.It was at a meeting for Tech Coast Angels that Ken was introduced to EpiGenX,and through that company he would meet Mikovits. He later gushed about her:“Judy was a very well-spoken, knowledgeable, and dedicated scientist who wantedto do everything possible to find effective treatments for cancer,” saidRichards. On the question of why Mikovits seemed to have both strong supportersand critics, Richards said, “I tell everybody, Judy is very controversial. Manypeople do not like her and many people admire her. I am in the later category.She speaks her mind. When she develops a view, she is dedicated to that view andwill defend it fiercely. She’s combative in a positive sense, and that tends toirritate some people.”Richards believed that many of Mikovits’s detractors had fallen victim to anunconscious form of sexism in which an assertive woman was “viewed as a bitch”while a man making a similarly impassioned defense of his position would be“admired and respected for his firm stance.”35[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach1fn_74] It seemed like the kind of post-feministstatement that perhaps only a man could make and be fully heard, especiallyregarding a disease like ME/CFS that was incorrectly thought to only affectwomen and had been derogatorily referred to as “Yuppie flu” in its early years,with mocking press implying that women contracting the disease were overlydriven.Even though Mikovits would eventually leave EpiGenX, her tie with Richards wouldremain solid and he would remain a steadfast supporter. In 2011, Richards wasputting together a private equity firm to invest in early stage technology andbiotechnology companies. “[We] needed somebody with a strong science background,the first person I thought of was Judy Mikovits.”When a few higher-ups asked questions about bringing on this controversialfigure, Richards had several cards to play on Judy’s behalf. In addition to arecommendation from the respected Frank Ruscetti, Nobel Prize winner LucMontagnier was very supportive of Judy and wrote highly of her work and herintegrity when he penned a recommendation to the Yorkbridge management.* * *After her chance run-in at the yacht club, Mikovits did some cursory research onHHV-6, and within a few hours felt comfortable that she understood most of theissues, mainly the question of whether HHV-6 initiated the disease process orwas simply a consequence of a poorly functioning immune system. The questionswere much the same as they had been in HIV/AIDS research.Her doctoral thesis had in fact been on the development of AIDS from HIVinfection.36 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach1fn_75] She had the curious experienceof defending her thesis shortly after the basketball player Magic Johnson hadannounced he had tested positive for HIV in November of 1991. Because Johnsonwas such a beloved sports star and defied widespread stereotypes about who gotAIDS and who didn’t, his revelation had shaken the country and cracked openborders for marginalized groups. The focus of the committee at her thesisdefense was the question: based on your thesis do you think Magic Johnson willultimately develop and die of AIDS?The soon-to-be Dr. Mikovits answered that she thought Johnson’s long-termprospects looked good. His infection appeared to have been recently acquired, soif he took the recently developed antiretroviral therapy (ART) that preventedthe HIV virus from replicating and integrating into tissue reservoirs of themonocyte and macrophages, it would never cause the immune deficiency. ForJohnson, HIV might not be able to establish itself in hidden reservoirs, if theystarted him on the antiretrovirals quickly after his initial infection.In all likelihood, Mikovits told her thesis committee then, Johnson could lookforward to an average life-span. Nearly fourteen years later, as Mikovits satdown to write an email to Loomis in November 2005, she reflected on Johnson’scontinuing good health, which many would have thought magical thinking in 1991.She included her résumé in the email and details of the upcoming sale ofEpiGenX. Loomis emailed Mikovits back within a few hours and they made plans tomeet at Loomis’s house in Montecito. They talked for much of the afternoon.Loomis said she was interested in bringing Mikovits on staff in some sort ofresearch capacity. Ablashi had the title of research director, so that wouldremain with him.But some position would be found for Mikovits.Mikovits wrote an excited email to Ruscetti about the job offer, noting how muchshe disliked the turmoil of EpiGenX’s pending sale, being put in charge of duediligence for the sale, and that—more than anything else—she wanted to get backto working with patients and doing research. Ruscetti was a little morecautious, hesitant about the involvement of Ablashi. He thought Ablashi was cutfrom the same cloth as Gallo, and part of what had gone wrong in retrovirologyin the past thirty years, turning what should have been a collaborative searchfor truth about the greatest scourge of recent history into a cruel and brutishcompetition for individual glory.37 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach1fn_76]Against the advice of Ruscetti, Mikovits took the job.* * *Within the first couple of weeks she worked as a consultant for the HHV-6Foundation, Mikovits took Loomis to her lab at EpiGenX. Loomis was excited overthe large freezer they had at the facility and explained that she worked withDr. Daniel Peterson, a physician in Incline Village, who—along with Dr. PaulCheney—stumbled upon and then started treating the “walking wounded” from thefirst modern outbreak of what was called at the time, chronic fatigue syndrome(CFS) at Lake Tahoe in 1984–1985.The name would later be changed to myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatiguesyndrome (ME/CFS). It was a surreal reality for these small-town doctors in theplacid setting nestled in the mountains, like being in a remote area of the Alpsunaware that it was wartime and finding an office filled with never-before-seeninjuries.The patients kept stumbling into the practice in Incline Village, as baffled asthe doctors, while Peterson and Cheney tried to take detailed testing andrecords with little certainty about what to offer beyond symptomatic treatments.Peterson reputedly had a repository of blood samples dating back to that firstoutbreak, which would be ideal for research. Mikovits dreamed of the diagnostictests she could run on the blood. Loomis told Mikovits that she and Petersonshould write papers together since that was not one of Peterson’s strengths,whereas Mikovits had more than forty published articles to her name.After the initial burst of excitement of the first couple weeks, though, therewas a disconnect between what Mikovits thought she would be doing and what shewas assigned. Mikovits figured a bright spot might be preparing for the 5thInternational Conference on HHV-6 and -7, to be held later that year inBarcelona, Spain. Loomis wanted her to find companies and individuals to sponsorthe meeting. She knew that Mikovits had many contacts from her years at the NCIand her years in the biotech field.Mikovits reviewed the abstracts for the conference, knowing the rigorousstandards the pharmaceutical companies and scientific experts would expect.After reading the abstracts she grew more despondent. There was no realuniformity to the papers and Mikovits felt she could not present the idea ofsponsoring the conference to any of her colleagues due to the fact there was solittle actual science in any of them. It wasn’t necessarily a criticism of thescientists. It was largely a reflection of the paltry level of funding given tostudy the virus. Without serious money given to study a problem, nobody could beexpected to produce high-quality science.Loomis was upset when Mikovits said she couldn’t find any sponsors for theconference among the scientists and organizations she knew. After those aimlessearly weeks and after talking it over with her husband, Mikovits made adecision. She had promised to go to the meeting in Barcelona, but when theconference was over she would leave the HHV-6 Foundation and look for anotherjob.* * *Barcelona, Spain—May 1, 2006Gallo finished his dinner talk and Mikovits was glad she had been able to avoidlistening too closely. The pharmaceutical reps at her table had been livelycompany. To the public, Gallo was still a respected figurehead, but some viewedhim as somebody who had been “saved” because a true accounting of his misconductwould have been a stain on the prestige of American science.38[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach1fn_77]After Gallo’s talk there was an award being given to one of the members of theboard of directors of the HHV-6 Foundation, Annette Whittemore. Mikovits knewthe name, but had not otherwise been aware of the Whittemores until the awardannouncement and the letter written by her husband Harvey as a prelude. Mikovitslearned that Annette’s father had been a doctor for small rural communities ineastern Nevada. Later Mikovits would learn that Annette’s father had deliveredall of Senator Reid’s children. Annette also had a degree in special educationand had worked for several years with children who had autism. She appeared abit overwhelmed by the tribute, kindly thanking the group before quickly exitingthe stage.As Annette stepped down from the podium, Mikovits couldn’t help but reflect onthe contents of Harvey’s letter, detailing what a loving, virtuous, personAnnette seemed to be: just the kind of person Mikovits wanted to be around.* * *Barcelona, Spain—May 3, 2006Dan Peterson gave the morning presentation on the final day of the conference.He was listed in the program as “Principal Investigator, Chronic FatigueSyndrome and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome”39 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach1fn_78]out of Incline Village, Nevada. It was only fitting he should have such anexalted title given his association with ME/CFS ever since it had appearedamongst those snow-capped peaks in 1984–1985.Mikovits sat in the back of the room, thinking she had only a few more hoursleft of the conference and her attention was waning a bit, when Peterson came tohis last slide. The slide contained data from sixteen people with ME/CFS and thevarious cancers they had developed over time, which obviously piqued herinterest after so many years at the National Cancer Institute.40[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach1fn_79] In addition to the cancers, the slide showedthe results of their immune cell testing.The T cells showed some unusual abnormalities known as clonal rearrangements.This meant instead of making many different generalized T cells to target all ofthe pathogens that might appear, these patients’ cells seemed to be focused on asingular insult, leaving their immune systems vulnerable to other invaders as ifthe cells were obsessively staring down the crosshairs of a gun at one targetwhile other invaders snuck in from behind.This piqued Mikovits’s attention because T cells eliminate virus and cancercells and abnormalities meant the body would have a reduced ability to fight offa viral pathogen. A chronic viral infection lying in wait for many years mightend up causing a cancer. Mikovits also saw on the slide a few mantle celllymphoma cases. At the time she was participating in a cancer support group inVentura, and a few of those women also had mantle cell lymphoma. Mikovits’syears at the NCI working with Ruscetti had drilled into her the idea thatwhenever one saw a cluster occurrence of illnesses, one should think aboutpathogenic causes. This dictum wasn’t always true, but it was a logical place tostart.Peterson told the assembled group that he didn’t know what the unusual T-cellabnormality meant and stated that if anybody had any idea they should come upand talk to him. Mikovits nearly sprinted up to the podium to grab hisattention. They talked for several minutes and Peterson was enthusiastic abouther expertise and invited her up to Incline Village to look over his files andtalk with patients. She would meet with the Whittemores and with Peterson, whowas treating the Whittemores’ aforementioned daughter, Andrea, to see if therewere any ways she might assist their efforts. Mikovits also thought she might beable to link the mystery of the T-cell abnormality to the pathogenesis ofME/CFS.Exciting collaborations seemed to be afoot and Mikovits was unexpectedly lookingtoward Nevada, a state that had used the slogans, “Wide Open” and “Battle Born.”Both slogans would prove prescient for her as she ventured into what seemed tobe a wide-open field of possibility and found herself battling bullyingopposition and intangible demons.Reno had hosted its own slogans and nicknames over the years too, such as “ALittle West of Center” and “Far From Expected,” catch phrases that seemed toconnote a climate of broad-minded risk taking that would welcome aninsubordinate scientist who stuck to her guns."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWOThe Move to NevadaThroughout the 1990s and early 2000s . . . Whittemore . . . was the supremelegislative lobbyist. He represented the gaming, tobacco and liquor industries .. . He could get legislators to pass the legislation his clients wanted and thenhelp the same legislators finance their next political campaigns.1[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach2fn_80]—Las Vegas Review, February 26, 2012Sparks, Nevada—early June 2006Judy Mikovits first met with Harvey and Annette Whittemore at the Red HawkResort and Country Club in Sparks, Nevada. Red Hawk was a place withpreternaturally green golf courses rimmed with mountain views, dining areas withtasteful stonework and towering wood pillars, and a luxe-yet-earthy aesthetic:even the restaurant’s house wines were from La Terre (the earth) winery, areminder that patrons were in a verdant but obviously man-made paradise.2[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach2fn_81]The juxtaposition of green fairways and the arid desert was one Harvey seemed tolove as a Nevada developer. Other regions of the country had transitioned fromdust bowl to arable plains, from marshy tall grass to farmland, and this processof revamping unruly land often involved both visionary thinkers and sometimes aheavy human hand. Sparks sat about thirty minutes east of Reno, and manyinitially thought it was a crazy location for a city. It was plunked right inthe middle of the desert, where average rainfall was less than eight inches peryear. Economic growth in Reno in the 1950s had created a rising demand for lowcost housing, and Nevada was known for risk-takers seeking unexpected payoffs.Developers successfully grabbed water rights to divert streams from the SierraNevadas that towered to the West, thus allowing the city to prosper. Theapproximately 90,000 people of Sparks were housed in a neat layout around thecentrally-located tower for John Ascuaga’s Nugget Casino, which wasunderstatedly flashy by Nevada terms. Nevadans often joked, “Reno is so close tohell you can see Sparks!”Water rights, being so central to life and property and a protected commodity inthe West, could be harder to secure than cattle in modern-day Nevada. The SilverState might as well have been named after the battle over silvery streams andrivers. When her car glided closer to the Red Hawk resort it was difficult to beunimpressed by the sheer audacity of what Harvey Whittemore had pulled off inthe high desert. The Resort at Red Hawk sat on land that had originally belongedto George Wingfield, who during his sixty-three years in Nevada had been aminer, banker, rancher, investor, and—like Harvey Whittemore—a developer andpolitical power broker.3 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach2fn_82]Harvey and his fellow developer David Loeb chose to preserve the original ranchhouse of the man nicknamed “King George” when they built their resort among thesage, reeds, and rushes where Wingfield had once set his duck blinds and raisedLabrador retrievers in the shadow of the nearby Pah Rah Mountains. In the springof 1997, Harvey and his partner opened the first of their two golf courses, theLakes Course, designed by the famed golf architect, Robert Trent Jones II.Sitting upon Audubon Certified protected natural wetlands and featuring naturallakes, murmuring springs, and cottonwood trees, the course was designed toembrace the idyllic landscape.In the ensuing years the Lakes Course was named “Best Golf Course in Reno” seventimes by the Reno Gazette Journal.4 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach2fn_83] In 2001,Harvey’s group built a second course designed by player-turned-golf-architectHale Irwin. Then they broke ground on a permanent clubhouse and a variety ofresidential options ranging from large homes to condominiums.Mikovits immediately noticed the respect bordering on reverence that theemployees seemed to have for Harvey and Annette. Later she noticed glimmers ofnepotism in the same Whittemore mirage, as she learned that many of theemployees at Red Hawk were the children of close friends or even family members.In person, Harvey could be considered a physically intimidating man, standingwell over six foot four, his reddish hair cropped and thinning, almost militarystyle. He also had a well-trimmed goatee, giving him a rebellious look for abusinessman and adding to the waft of celebrity that followed him around RedHawk and beyond. Harvey’s office was mightily extravagant. An enormous baywindow overlooked the Lakes Course and autographed sports memorabilia ornamentedthe walls along with flat screen TVs.In many meetings to come, Mikovits would typically join the Whittemores in asmall conference room. Before the meetings started, a waiter typically slippedin to ask if they needed drinks or food. This first meeting, however, they metin the evening in a conference room right off of the restaurant where they coulddine properly on the restaurant’s New American cuisine. On the heels of therecent Barcelona conference, they were joined by Dan Peterson and Dr. Greg Pari,a professor at the Department of Microbiology and Immunology for the Universityof Nevada, Reno (UNR). In 2010, Pari would become chair of that department.5[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach2fn_84]During the meeting, the Whittemores first proposed to Mikovits their idea ofstarting a research institute in collaboration with UNR. They believed aninstitute dedicated to all aspects of neuroimmune disease, one that couldencompass the work of the HHV-6 Foundation under the auspices of a commonacademic home, was the best approach to streamline the research and bringscientific powerhouses together.Pari thought it was a terrible idea, even though the Whittemores had envisionedhim as perfect for the job of research director. Pari told the Whittemores if hewas involved in a significant capacity his salary alone would cost somewherenorth of two hundred fifty thousand dollars a year. But Pari didn’t want the jobanyway.6 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach2fn_85] Even with his protests, he didremain interested enough to show up at WPI parties, and he would later join itsScientific Advisory Board after Mikovits was fired.7[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach2fn_86]With Pari declining the offer to be research director of astill-not-yet-existent WPI, the others agreed that Mikovits should spend thesummer commuting to Peterson’s office to learn about the disease and beginlaying out plans for the WPI. Her routine quickly fell into place. She took aSouthwest flight early Monday mornings, spent the week working at Peterson’soffice at Incline Village, then flew home to be with David on Friday night. Thiswould remain her routine before the WPI acquired laboratory space from theuniversity.* * *One Friday, as Mikovits flew back to southern California, she thought of whatshe had learned over the week about Andrea Whittemore. Annette later wrote along and thorough article, which gave much of her daughter’s history as well asthe rationale for the founding of the institute. It was published in the June2010 issue of Molecular Interventions8 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach2fn_87]. Shewrote of Andrea coming down with a mono-like illness in 1989, months of flu-likesymptoms, and symptoms including tachycardia (abnormal heart rate), swollenlymph glands, muscle pain, and night sweats. The doctor diagnosed the conditionas being psychological in nature, which seemed ridiculous to Annette.In November of 2009, shortly after the publication of the article by Mikovitsand her team in Science that showed an association between the XMRV retrovirusand ME/CFS Andrea Whittemore-Goad went public with her story on a Facebookposting for the WPI.9 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach2fn_88]“My name is Andrea Whittemore-Goad,” she wrote. “Until last year I wasuncomfortable telling my story to complete strangers, but now if this is what ittakes for all to understand the severity of this disease, I will.” She recountedhow as a young girl she’d had a poor reaction to a DPT booster and that infourth grade she came down with a mono-like illness after a tonsillectomy. Afterthe surgery she had gastrointestinal problems and tachycardia and none of thedoctors could tell her parents what was wrong. But the medical professionalswere scared. One psychiatrist told her to get out of her office because shedidn’t want to catch what Andrea had. Another told her parents that Andrea was“school-phobic.”Annette continued the story in her Molecular Interventions article.10[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach2fn_89] A neighbor suggested they visit a Petersonwho had treated patients from the Incline Village outbreak of 1984–1985.Peterson turned out to have a good understanding of the disease, and althoughhis treatments seemed to provide mostly symptomatic relief, Andrea made slow butsteady progress under his care. Her mother elaborated:She continued this modest improvement until she decided to enroll at theUniversity of Nevada, Reno. The admission policy required the measles, mumps,and rubella (MMR) vaccination prior to starting classes. Within five days of theMMR vaccination, Andrea had a severe relapse and never regained her previouslevel of health.11 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach2fn_90]Andrea’s Facebook post recounted that her reaction to the MMR vaccination lefther confined to a wheelchair.12 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach2fn_91] Over the nextseveral years, the family tried numerous strategies to improve Andrea’s health,without much luck until Andrea was twenty-one and they stumbled upon Ampligen, asubstance that acts to stimulate the body’s antiviral defenses.Compared to other treatments, for Andrea it was a godsend, a gift she didn’ttake for granted since she was one of the very few patients with access to thedrug under controlled trials. She took Ampligen off and on for eight years:While taking Ampligen, Andrea improved to 75% of her previous levels of energyand stamina, but despite many of the positive outcomes, she continued to fallill with opportunistic infections. For unknown reasons, Andrea began to developreactions to Ampligen, making her too sick to continue.In 2006, when Mikovits first started working in Nevada, Andrea was doingrelatively well, although there were clear indications that the Ampligen wasproducing less than a full recovery. This had also been true of earlymonotherapy for AIDS, where stumbles and severe relapses often followedimprovements.* * *When Mikovits first arrived at Peterson’s office in Incline Village to begin herinvestigation she encountered her new “staff,”—three summer studentinterns—waiting for her.13 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach2fn_92] The crew includedDavid Pomeranz, who later went on to USC Medical School, and Byron Hsu, a youngman from Berkeley: both hired from a job listing on Monster.com[http://www.Monster.com]. The third member was Katy Hagen, whose mother was afriend of Annette’s.After talking with David, Byron, and Katy for a few minutes it became clear thatnone of them knew much about science in a research setting. Yet they all seemedlike motivated, brainy, greenhorns and Mikovits had often worked with similarlyraw students at the National Cancer Institute. She enjoyed the challenge andenergy associated with new learning and often found that their inexperiencecould be a positive as they would work hard to master the right techniques,entering with what Buddhists call a “beginner’s mind.”In their previous discussions, Mikovits remembered Peterson talking about his“repository” of samples. She had already compiled a mental list of investigativestudies which might be conducted with them. Things were moving forward. Therehad been a meeting with Dr. John McDonald, who at the time was dean of themedical school, and Harvey and Annette had already started meeting with stateand national politicians about the feasibility of putting an institute togetherat UNR.Mikovits asked Byron to find a few patient samples using dates and patients fromthe original table Peterson had showed in Barcelona, especially the ones withMantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL). Then she started discussing with David and Katy whatthey would need to do to build an Excel data sheet to match the critical recordsfrom each of the patients to their samples in the repository. It seemed toMikovits that Byron had only been gone for just a minute or two when he wasback.“I think you need to see this,” Byron said. Mikovits followed Byron down thehallway to a small room which held a large deep freezer about six feet tall bythree or four feet deep and just as wide. Byron opened the freezer and Mikovitssaw it was filled from top to bottom with plastic bags containing tubes withwritten names and birthdates scribbled on the side of each tube.Oh my God! This is the great repository? Mikovits thought. Many of these sampleshad in all likelihood been logged prior to the more stringent privacy laws. Froma scientific standpoint there were more significant problems. Freezing wholeblood destroyed evidence of RNA viruses and the even more delicate RNA messengermolecules whose importance was just beginning to be understood, leaving behindonly DNA.Mikovits and her new team drove down to the local grocery store and bought ablock of dry ice, a few bottles of isopropynol, and cotton swabs. The internswould start the summer by rubbing the names off of thousands of tubes, puttingdates and identification numbers on them as required under the more stringentprivacy laws, and building the information into Excel files.Mikovits would start by contacting the patients, making arrangements to drawnew, fresh blood, properly harvested. On one of her weekends back in southernCalifornia she stopped by EpiGenX. She got permission to take some extrapipettes, bottles of trizol, vials that could withstand being cryogenicallyfrozen, and reagents which would allow the samples to be frozen withoutdestroying the nucleic acids.The repository may not have been what she expected, but Mikovits would make surethat this new repository was a resource they could trust to answer their mostchallenging questions.* * *The first hypothesis Mikovits came up with was that they might be able to find abiomarker of a viral infection in the sampled patients by measuring the abilityto produce alpha interferon from plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) introducedinto a patient culture sample. PDCs are immune cells circulating in the blood. Ahealthy individual will produce large amounts of interferon from their PDCs whenexposed to retroviruses like HIV.These cells can be harvested from blood and the amount of interferon theyproduce can be measured.Frank Ruscetti had done some of the original work on PDCs and human retrovirusesand had a good store of the cells. Mikovits was able to get fresh primary PDCsand the interferon-producing PDC cell line, CAL-1, and use them to test patientsamples. To her surprise, none of the samples were pumping out interferon. Itwas an interesting finding as PDCs infected with HTLV-1 did not produceinterferon either. A key part of the immune response was disabled in ME/CFSpatients, just as in HTLV-1, which caused cancer and neuroinflammatory disease.Mikovits and Ruscetti were both intrigued.Mikovits spent a good deal of time taking data from patients about theirmaladies. During this time she also did consulting work for a biotech companythat had developed a unique chemokine/cytokine multiplexed assay. She used thistest that measured inflammatory markers (usually a sign of infection) on thepatients. In addition, she checked their levels of natural killer (NK) cellactivity and RNase L (other indicators of an abnormality in the innate immunesystems of ME/CFS patients). When using the cytokine/chemokine profiling testMikovits later recalled that:it was consistent with a viral infection. It didn’t have to be a specific virus,it’s just what we found when we ran the original viral expression micro-arrayexperiments that same summer. There was a highly dysregulated expression ofRNase L, there were various levels of significant expression for many differentkinds of virus. It really didn’t matter. Lots of HHV-6, lots of enteroviruses.So much noise that I did remark that these people looked like AIDS patients.14[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach2fn_93]She was not the only person to make the clinical observation that ME/CFSpatients resembled people with AIDS. Before HAART therapy for AIDS patients,when AIDS dementia complex (ADC) often went unchecked, Dr. Anthony Komaroff ofHarvard University published a vivid paper that compared the brain SPECT scans(to measure blood flow) of patients with ADC, ME/CFS, and unipolar depression tocontrols.Komaroff’s images showed well-lighted brains in depression and the control group(with the illuminated red, orange, and yellow tones representing blood flow tovarious areas of the brain), but an optically-stunning near “lights out” in ADCand ME/CFS that was shockingly similar, as if a violent storm had knocked outthe power grid in two neighboring states.15 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach2fn_94]That summer, Mikovits called Ruscetti and told him that among Peterson’spatients she had encountered a fifteen year old and a thirty year old withshingles.“That’s ridiculous,” Ruscetti replied. “They’d be AIDS patients.”“Yeah. Exactly what I was thinking.”Since the patients weren’t dying en masse as they did with AIDS, Mikovits knewit couldn’t be the HIV retrovirus. But what if it was another retrovirus,leading not to the predictable degeneration and death of untreated HIV/AIDS, butto a chronic, long-term disease, characterized by a loss of cellular energy anda lowering of the defenses of the body’s immune system, as in the slower-movingretrovirus HTLV-1? That would explain why patients presented with pathogeniccoinfections, just as AIDS patients did, as well as with cancers that oftenseemed to develop after decades of being sick.Cancers were, of course, associated with both the retroviruses HIV and HTLV-1,though with AIDS in the years before aggressive therapies they took a swiftercourse, and AIDS was even once called the “gay cancer” due to the unlikelyappearance of Kaposi’s Sarcoma (KS) in younger gay men before AIDS wasdefined—when KS at that time was thought to primarily target older Jewish men.Retroviruses are a family of ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses, which contain theenzyme reverse transcriptase. The virus enters a cell, uses the reversetranscriptase to direct the cell to create viral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA),which then integrates into the DNA of the host cell. The virus thus becomes partof the DNA of many of the cells of an infected person. Retroviruses haddocumented transmission through sexual contact, exposure to infected blood orblood products, or passage from an infected mother to her newborn child duringgestation, delivery, or even breastfeeding. Retroviruses are transferred viabody fluids, rather than by a vector such as a mosquito or a tick.Mikovits thought about the infections, conditions, and cancers associated withHIV infection. HIV causes problems by damaging the immune system, leaving itvulnerable to other organisms that can cause disease. The majority of peopleinfected by HIV first develop a flu-like illness within a month or two ofinfection, often suffering fever, muscle soreness, headaches, swollen glands,and chronic diarrhea—similar to the relatively common “flu-like” onset ofME/CFS. Latent infection can last from eight to ten years, giving some patientsin the early years of the pandemic the illusory impression that something theywere doing was staving off the progressive decline.Similar misattribution has at times impacted ME/CFS patients due to lack ofviable treatments—or, more commonly, led to many claims from outsiders ofpseudo-cures, which can thrive when an illness’s course is unknown. Some withHIV develop full-blown AIDS sooner, and others later. Usually after one has beeninfected for ten years, the patients suffer from night sweats, fevers which lastfor weeks, weight loss, headaches, and chronic diarrhea.In poor nations, those with HIV/AIDS commonly develop tuberculosis.16[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach2fn_95] HIV/AIDS patients are also more susceptibleto salmonella, cytomegalovirus, candida, cryptococcal meningitis (aninflammation of the membranes and fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord),toxoplasma gondii (a parasite spread by cats), and cryptosporidium (a parasitewhich lives in the intestines and bile ducts, leading to chronic diarrhea).17[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach2fn_96]One of the common neurological disorders is AIDS dementia complex, which usuallyleads to behavioral changes and diminished mental functioning. Mikovits couldn’thelp but think about the mental and cognitive changes associated with ME/CFS,such as memory loss, drop in IQ, problems on neuropsychological testing,word-finding difficulties, computation problems, and many others.Considering all the clues and in light of early observations that ME/CFS hadoverlap with AIDS, it seemed they were on the trail of a retrovirus.* * *Early in her work at Peterson’s office, he advised her to be extremely discreetabout whom she saw in the office.18 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach2fn_97] She wasstarting to learn the politics of ME/CFS.Mainly, that if you had it, you didn’t want anybody to know.Peterson, given his prominent role during the first modern outbreak of 1984–1985in Incline Village, was known as the doctor to the rich and famous. Mikovits wasamazed at the small but steady flow of Hollywood actors and professionalathletes who came through Peterson’s office to get some relief from the disease.If one saw somebody famous in the waiting room, the protocol was to act like theperson was like any other patient there. That came easily to Mikovits, as shenever fancied herself a fan of anybody, and even if she found herself in anelevator with a favorite baseball player, she would let him have his privacy.When she wasn’t talking about science or doing her volunteer work, she wasactually a quiet person. She knew this would no doubt surprise many of hercolleagues, who often referred to her as “Tsunami Judy” for the torrent of wordsthat could pour forth from her when she was excited about a subject.Since it was summer, the Whittemores were typically in residence at their homein the Glenbrook neighborhood at Lake Tahoe. Past the double-gated securitycheckpoint, residents often drove around in golf carts and the houses all hadnames. The historic name of the Whittemore home was the Lake Shore House andresembled a two-story southern mansion, with an enormous wrap-around porch, abeach where one could swim out into the cove, and a private dock out back whereHarvey had several boats.Mikovits enjoyed the life at Glenbrook, often walking out on the dock just asHarvey was pulling up in his new thirty-foot power boat, while an employeegrabbed the line. Harvey would tell her and anybody else who might be on thedock to go ahead and jump in, and they’d speed off across the enormous Alpinelake. Sometimes they would get all the way to the California side, tie up theboat at Jake’s on the Lake restaurant, have dinner and drinks (for whichMikovits never saw the bill), and then hop back in the boat and race home. Itwas a lifestyle to which anyone could become accustomed.There were some townhomes located next door, and the Whittemores bought one tohost their friends and their children. The townhouse had a high loft with largewindows and a reading cove where Andrea would often sit with a book while herfamily’s guests enjoyed the beach. Mikovits couldn’t help but think it was dueto Andrea’s condition and not wanting to provoke what many ME/CFS patientscalled “a crash” caused by overexerting her limited supplies of energy.Down the road about a mile and an easy walk was “The Barn” which was owned bysomebody else but was where the Whittemores held most of their social events andpolitical fundraisers. It was once an actual barn but had been completelyrenovated with nice wooden floors, a bar, picnic tables, pinball machines,basketball hoops like the ones at a county fair, antique Coke machines whichwould dispense the soda in their classic hourglass shaped bottles, and horsesaddles and other farming implements on the walls displayed like pieces of fineart.19 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach2fn_98]The Whittemores were also crazy about sports, a passion they shared withMikovits. They had a skybox on the fifty-yard line for the University of Nevada,Reno, football games, seats on the floor for basketball, and season tickets forthe Reno Aces, a minor league baseball team. Mikovits couldn’t help but noticethat Harvey’s seats at Aces Stadium were in front of those for Dean Heller, theRepublican Senator for the state who served alongside Senator Harry Reid inWashington, DC. Not far away from those seats were those for CongresswomanShelley Berkeley, who would unsuccessfully challenge Heller for his US Senateseat.Nevada’s circle of power was small, and now, working for the Whittemores,Mikovits had a front row seat to it all.* * *Over the Fourth of July holiday in 2006 Judy and David went to Hawaii, but Judywasn’t participating in the Aloha spirit. Instead she spent the whole timeparked in a cozy cabana chair with her silver laptop from EpiGenX writing grantproposals. Loomis, Whittemore, and Peterson would then determine if they couldfund the research or if they could present it to one of their wealthier patientswho might be interested in funding. It was an abnormal life for a researcher,but one that was becoming common for many scientists. As government sponsorshipof science declined, the public was often left to fill the gap.As Mikovits settled further into her weekly routine, the Whittemores arrangedfor her to get a free dorm room at Sierra Nevada College, which was close toPeterson’s office. Occasionally, the Whittemores would treat Mikovits to a fewdays in a luxurious condominium at Red Hawk. The condos were large with lavishmarble appointments and beautiful faucets and sinks. There were always big softrobes and towels as well as fancy hand soaps and lotions. The attention todetail and elegance was almost intoxicating. Mikovits could go down to therestaurant or swimming pool and know she would be waited on hand and foot.Mikovits had a friend, a coworker from the National Cancer Institute inFrederick, Maryland, who lived in Reno and was a professor at the university. Ona couple of occasions, the two would meet at Red Hawk and they’d spend time atthe swimming pool.20 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach2fn_99] While Mikovits frienddidn’t personally know the Whittemores, she knew of them and told Mikovits thatthe Whittemores had a good reputation among her colleagues. Several times thatsummer the Whittemores took Mikovits to dinner at David’s Grill at Red Hawk.They might start off with crab cakes with California pepper aioli or just diveright in to a fettucine alfredo with a gluten-free pasta option. Many prominentbusiness people and local politicians would often drop by the table to say helloto the Whittemores. Harvey would always introduce Mikovits as their “dearfriend” who was helping them with Andrea’s disease and his wife’s institution.And a few times they’d jokingly say they were “trying to make her family.”Their family was so admirably close-knit and accomplished that it was hard notto be warmed by those words, and Judy Mikovits was already starting to feel likepart of the Whittemore clan.* * *The summer was ending and Mikovits wasn’t sure what she should do, but she hadto transition from the luxuriant summer of power boats and her young assistantsinto something more stable. She had an offer from a biotech company for whom shehad been consulting recently. The company had some natural product drugs whichwere close to clinical trial for cancer treatment and they offered her alucrative compensation package to become the vice president of research. Andwhile she had loved her “summer staff” and the patients, she didn’t exactly knowif this institute would ever get off the ground. Then there was the problem offunding. The research community didn’t seem to believe ME/CFS was a priority, sothere were lots of appeals to wealthy individuals or families who might have aloved one with the disease. The begging for philanthropy is a constant curse ofa maligned illness, but ME/CFS had the additional curse of patients being toosick to pound on doors or to march through the streets and shout funding demandsthrough a bullhorn.“Harvey, you can’t let her leave!” Annette had pouted when Mikovits had toldAnnette she was considering another opportunity. “Make her a good offer soshe’ll stay!”Harvey asked Mikovits what it would take to keep her.Mikovits said she wanted a five-year guaranteed contract (as would one see for avalued player in baseball) and the ability to keep their beach home in Oxnardbecause that’s where they planned to retire. If she did take the job in Reno,they’d want to become full members of the community by purchasing a small homeor condominium. Harvey asked if she’d withhold making a decision for a while tosee if he could use his influence and make some things happen.Mikovits agreed to give Harvey some time.By a happy coincidence Frank and Sandy Ruscetti had been invited to UNR by oneof their former colleagues from the NCI to give a seminar at the end of themonth. Mikovits thought it would be a perfect opportunity for him to meet theWhittemores and weigh in on the long-term prospect of her continuing to work forthem.Not that she had taken his advice in the past. When she’d met and married David,Frank Ruscetti had told her it was a bad time to leave the NCI and try to getinto the biotech industry. He had advised against her signing with EpiGenX, andhe’d also advised against going to work for the HHV-6 Foundation.* * *Reno, Nevada—October 31, 2006As Frank Ruscetti and his wife, Sandy, drove to the Whittemore’s house inGlenbrook, Frank considered how far his dear friend had come in the twenty-threeyears since he had hired the protein chemist who could not find a cell under amicroscope.But even though she’d left the East Coast for the West, Frank and Judy stilltalked on the phone several times a week. In the years they’d worked togetherJudy had become like family, occasionally baby sitting their only son so thatFrank and Sandy could have a night out at the Shakespeare theater. Now in thismomentous decision of her life, whether to take a job as the research directorof an institute which hadn’t even been built, she wanted Frank and Sandy to comeand check it out.Frank liked the Whittemores and felt the offer to Judy was a fair one. He wasimpressed with the Whittemore’s friendliness, how unpretentious they were, andtheir dedication to finding answers for the ME/CFS that plagued their daughter.It all culminated in a small, simple dinner with the Whittemores at the LakeShore house along with Mikovits and her husband and Dr. Peterson and his wife,Mary. The Whittemores cooked spaghetti and garlic bread and tossed a salad whilethe guests hovered about them in the kitchen and played Trivial Pursuit. Marywas an educator and an aspiring playwright like Frank. Everyone was enjoying acasual moment so comfortable it seemed they’d been friends for years instead ofjust meeting a few hours earlier.After the meal was over, Frank took Harvey aside and gave him the third degree:What were Harvey’s motivations? What did he want to get out of this? Harveyreplied that his daughter was now in her mid-twenties and had been ill since shewas twelve years old. Money could do a lot of things, but if your child wassick, how much did that matter? His taut face belied a father’s anguish that hisdaughter had lost her most carefree years to illness, with no end in sight.Harvey seemed to know a great deal about local history and Frank was pleasedthat Harvey had interests beyond business. Frank thought he glimpsed a man whorelished intellectual combat when he asked Harvey if he knew where the namesakeof the city of Reno was buried. Harvey knew the city was named after UnionGeneral Jesse Reno who died in the Civil War, but didn’t know where he wasburied.“His grave is in Frederick, Maryland, near the National Cancer Institute,” Franktold him, a little smugly. “He died at the Battle of South Mountain. I’ve beenthere a couple times.”Frank could see Harvey was slightly unnerved that he had known a bit of Nevadatrivia that Harvey didn’t. Harvey was clearly a man who didn’t like to lose.That could be a good thing. They talked for a while longer and then Frankabruptly said, “Harvey, this has been a lovely evening, but I must confess to asense of disappointment.”“Why’s that?” Harvey asked, slightly taken aback.“I’ve always believed like the French philosopher Balzac that ‘behind everyfortune lies a great crime.’ And during this time you’ve made a lot of progressin disabusing me of that notion.”They had a good laugh over that. When Frank and Sandy were at the airport thenext day, Judy called him on his cell phone. “What should I do?” she asked.“Take the damned job!” he grumbled.She followed his advice, as she said she would.Frank later lamented it was the worst advice he had ever given anyone.21[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach2fn_100]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREEDay Two in JailJudy, there’s something in this house.—Mikovits’s stepfather as he lay dying of aggressive prostate cancerSaturday, November 19, 2011At a quarter to six in the morning, the tower guards pealed over theloud-speakers, “Breakfast will be served in fifteen minutes.” A speaker in eachcell linked the prisoners to the main tower, a squawking, ever-present reminderof the institutional setting. Messages could be dispatched to all cells or to anindividual one. Each prisoner quickly learned a Pavlovian response to the noise:she was supposed to be fully dressed, have her bunk made, wrap her small towelaround her neck, make her booking notice visible on her arm, and be facing thefar wall opposite the door with her nose actually touching the wall.1[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach3fn_101]Mikovits couldn’t recall what had happened in the moments before the guardjostled her out of the dreamy state where she could forget where she was for aminute. Maybe she had drifted off to sleep again. Marie was preparing for theroll call so Mikovits hurriedly swung herself down from her bunk to do the same.The previous night she had been issued a bar of soap slightly larger than asilver dollar as well as a single aluminum foil packet of toothpaste. Shequickly used both of them, not realizing these were the only toiletries theywould provide to her for the next five days.Not realizing the protocol, Judy faced the door as she waited and noticed thethickness of the steel entry to their cell and the small window, no more thaneight inches long by six inches wide, which allowed the guard to peer in and seeif they were ready. She felt a tap on her shoulder and turned to see hercellmate motioning her to the back wall. “You need to do this,” Marie said,turning to face the wall with her nose touching. “Trouble for all today if youdo not do this.” She exaggerated her face and gestures.The guards came by, eyeballing her booking number and attire. She passed muster,and she and Marie were perfunctorily led out of their cell and lined up againstthe wall until the guards were finished checking everybody. When all of theprisoners were assembled, they were marched to breakfast. Mikovits took a momentto observe the strategic layout of the facility. Each cell block was like atriangular-shaped petal attached to a center, with the cells at the far wide endnarrowing down to a single exit which led into a large circular room that wasthe center of the “flower” of these cellblock petals around it. The circleserved as their “free time” room as well as where they got their meals beforereturning to their cells to eat. The “tower” was in the middle of the four“petals” that circled it, allowing the guards to see the individual cell-blocksas well as the free time areas.The breakfast that morning was powdered eggs and either French toast orpancakes, which looked like it had come out of the freezer and had been thrownin a huge oven on a sheet tray. She took the filled plate, but did not plan toeat, especially not the eggs, which looked about as appetizing as decades-oldfood in a bomb shelter. She expected to be able to post bail by the end of theday and be released. As she looked at the reconstituted eggs on the sad-lookingpaper plate all she could think of was how happy she was that her last mealbefore incarceration had been a wonderful breakfast burrito at Mrs. Olson’sCoffee Hut. Mrs. Olson’s was renowned for burritos so big you could slowlyexcavate them for a week (or she had joked), with fresh ingredients andhomestyle flair: heavenly by comparison.When the prisoners were done masticating the monotonous food, they pushed theirtrays out the door as directed. Other prisoners on their “free time” would comeby to collect the trays and dump the paper plates in the trash.At around eleven in the morning the speaker squawked, “Mikovits! You have avisitor! Prepare yourself!” Mikovits started to head toward the back wall inorder to put her nose against it when her cellmate stopped her. “No, you standat door, hands behind your back,” Marie said, modeling the proper posture. “Andyou walk to visiting area, same way. Hands behind back, no handcuffs.”“Oh, okay.” Mikovits assumed the position and looked to her cellmate forconfirmation.“Okay.” Marie said with a validating nod. The female guard opened the door, dida cursory check of Mikovits, and, gesturing for Judy to walk in front of her,motioned her forward to the visiting area. As Mikovits walked in front of her,the guard pointed to the signet ring on the middle finger of Judy’s right handand snapped. “No jewelry, inmate!”“It’s been on there a long time. Probably longer than you’ve been alive,” saidJudy. It was her signet ring from the University of Virginia at Charlottesville.One day in 1981, after hours in a cold room purifying natural products forcancer therapies, it had fallen off again, and in a fit of pique Judy hadslipped it over her middle finger where it had remained snugly attached to thatday. The guard was one of many people who claimed they had a “trick” for gettingrings off, normally involving twisting the metal in a certain way or using aspecial cream or lotion. The guard left for a moment and returned with one ofher “magic” creams. She put it on, and tried to twist and yank the ring off ofMikovits’s finger. Mikovits’s knuckle became red and inflamed as the ringtightened like gag Chinese finger handcuffs. “It has to come off,” said theguard after several minutes of trying. “This is for your own protection. Notelling what a prisoner might do to try and get it.”Mikovits understood the threat of harm coming to prisoners wearing jewelry, butthere was no getting that ring off her finger. For Judy it was a small triumph;a way to retain her own identity as an honest scientist with hard-working roots.Finally, the guard capitulated and led her in haste to the visitors, area. AsMikovits walked down the cellblock in front of the guard she could see a fewother prisoners getting ready. Visiting times were Friday, Saturday, and Sundayfrom 7:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. with cellblocks available for rotating in two-hourblocks and a half hour between each block. The routine enforced both complianceand a sense of drudgery.Family members wanting to visit a loved one were advised to call before showingup at the facility due to the fact that prisoners were often reassigned todifferent cellblocks with different visiting hours. Inmates were allowed twoscant half hour visits per week and at each visit were limited to having twoadults or one adult and one minor child. Any person entering the facility tovisit a prisoner was subject to a search.2 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach3fn_102]The rigidity of the visiting area shocked Mikovits: it seemed as obdurate assome of the prisoners. The walls were obsidian-black stainless steel and in thevisiting booths there was a single chair with a phone on the wall next to it.Mikovits went to the booth where David was waiting. She tried to give him abrave smile as she lifted the phone. “I’m doing okay,” she quickly mouthed intothe receiver. There was no audible reply from the other end, although she couldsee David’s lips earnestly moving. Mikovits turned to one of the guards. “Thephone isn’t working,” she complained.“Read the directions,” the guard replied in a surly voice.Mikovits leaned close but found that without her reading glasses it wasimpossible. Like a lot of people gradually losing eyesight, she made do bypicking up drugstore reading glasses. Her prescription was +3.25 and she knewthat soon she’d need something stronger from an optometrist. All those years ofpeering through microscopes had taken their toll. “I can’t read it,” saidMikovits. The guard exhaled in frustration, as if he heard illiteracy complaintsseveral times a day. “If you can’t read then your cellmate should be able toread the directions for you and tell you what to do.”“No, I can read, it’s just that I don’t have my glasses.”“You just pick up the phone, dial in the four digit number they gave you whenyou came in here, followed by your booking number, and the call will gothrough.”“What four digit number?” Mikovits asked.“The one you got when you came in here.”Mikovits remembered the small stack of papers she’d been given when she wasprocessed at two o’clock the previous morning. It must have been in there. “Ithink I left it back in my cell.”“Then I guess you’ll just have to have your visit tomorrow.”The moment was too much for Mikovits to endure. She started to cry. How couldshe be in such close proximity to David, be able to see him, and yet not be ableto talk to her husband and comfort him? He looked haggard, his face ashen: thesituation was obviously taking its toll. She knew he was probably worried sickthat she’d been abused in jail, but that was the least of her woes. She alsowanted to find out how he was faring through the shock and stress. He might noteven know that she wasn’t going to be carted off in the early morning hours toReno, that she was safe for now in Ventura. This was an upright, law-abidingman, and now he had a wife in jail.What had she done wrong?Nothing. She had tried to help the patients and protect the government’s money.The guard motioned for her to stand and put her hands behind her for the walkback to her cell. David looked befuddled and helpless behind the glass.She walked out of the visiting area, down the cellblock, into her cell, andheard the steel door cut through the air behind her, sounding menacing and finalin the way that only steel can.* * *David was determined he wasn’t going to leave the jail without talking to hiswife. After Mikovits had been taken from the visiting area, David went to talkto one of the guards. He explained in his disarming manner that she didn’t haveher reading glasses and was unfamiliar with the jail procedures. Couldn’t theybring her back one more time so she could actually speak to him? Meanwhile,Marie watched Mikovits come in and saw the distraught look on her face. Whenasked, Mikovits told her cellmate what had happened.“You cannot see?” Marie asked.“Maybe if the numbers were big enough.”Marie looked through Mikovits’s papers, found the four digit number and herbooking number from her wrist band, and wrote them on a piece of paper largeenough for Mikovits to read. “Can you read that now?”“Yes. Yes, I can,” said Mikovits. She thought that tomorrow she would get itright.A few minutes later, though, the guard in the tower made an announcement overthe loudspeaker: “Mikovits, you have a visitor.”“Okay, let’s try it again,” said the guard when he arrived. Mikovits put herhands behind her back, the guard entered, and they made the walk down thecellblock again. When she entered the room again and saw David, she felttriumphant. She sat down, picked up the phone, held the paper to her face, anddialed the numbers. The phone rang on David’s side of the glass and he pickedup. “How are you?” he asked gently.“I’m fine, honey. I can handle this. I’ve done nothing wrong.” She really wasresolute and at peace. She had been shocked by the arrest but felt the realdanger was in going back to Nevada. She worried that if she was under Harvey’salmost-despotic control over his lackeys in the Silver State, there was notelling what might happen. He had extended his far-reaching influence intoCalifornia to detain her, but folks in the Golden State weren’t his flunkies.They would take the orders he had padded with official-sounding legalese, butthey wouldn’t do his bidding.“Good. Because I’m trying to make things work out here. I got the bail, but Idon’t know what’s going on. It’s very strange. I don’t understand it. I’mtalking to Harvey, and Frank is helping as well. Frank is going to talk toHarvey. It’s all going to be okay.” They spoke hurriedly for a few more minutesand then their time was up. Fifteen minutes passed in a flash after one waslocked up in jail for nearly a day. When the guard came this time, Mikovits feltserene. She was back in control of a destabilizing situation. David was workingon her behalf and Frank also had her back. They were trying to reason withHarvey. They would all figure out a solution to get her out.Back in the cell, Marie was sleeping heavily. All that Mikovits could do wascrawl onto her bunk and gaze at the ceiling. Since she didn’t have her glassesshe couldn’t read anything. She could only lie there, making her think of theME/CFS patients who had to stay supine and reduce neurological stimulation,trapped in a liminal world of rest. At around four o’clock prisoners were takenout of their cells for “free time,” which usually lasted about four hours. Thecircular area, which contained the “view tower,” also had a room with concretefloors, steel picnic tables bolted to the ground, carts with books andmagazines, and a small television mounted high on the wall, about ten feet up toprotect it from the inmates. Without her glasses, she couldn’t read or followthe football game that was playing on the TV: it was as if she was in a foreignland.She tried pacing around the room, hoping the movement would wear her out alittle bit for better sleep, but she still wasn’t clear on all the protocols andknew that she had to watch the others for cues. When the door leading from thetower opened up and a guard walked in, all of the prisoners were supposed toimmediately find a seat. A few times Mikovits found herself the only personstanding, not realizing why everybody else seemed to be playing anincomprehensible game of musical chairs. Prisoners were also taken out of theircells for lunch and for dinner. Although she didn’t eat any of the lunch, shefigured she should try to have some dinner, even just a slab of mystery proteinto keep her strength up. Dinner was a hamburger and she took it, sliding themeat off of the bun and eating just the patty. It tasted like the cardboard endof an old oatmeal cylinder, but she had to eat something.* * *After dinner, and with her cellmate sleeping again, Mikovits found her thoughtsdrifting back to the chain of events that had caused this calamity. She tried tothink positively about Harvey Whittemore but her anger bubbled to the surface.How could he do this when they had so recently been allied for the same cause?How could he treat her like family and then do this? Hadn’t they learned who shewas over the past five years? She felt the walls of the cell closing in again.Then she prayed for Harvey and Annette to come to their senses and stop thismadness.Mikovits remembered her last discussion with Annette Whittemore a few monthsbefore at the Ottawa Conference in September of 2011. “I’m not going to be apart of this,” Mikovits had said after explaining again that the XMRV diagnostictest wasn’t clinically validated and thus they shouldn’t be selling itprematurely.3 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach3fn_103]Mikovits told Annette that as the Principal Investigator on their grants, shewas more than willing to take responsibility for the previous mistakes. “Butthat’s in the past. I won’t take responsibility for failure to take direction,”she continued. “We need to do the right thing, stop everything until we figurethis out!” Those were the last words she said in person to Annette.Mikovits realized her words and tone to Annette had been harsh, but she knewthey were honest. If she could go back and soften them she probably would havedone so, but her underlying message would remain unchanged: They could not ingood conscience sell that ineffective test.4 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach3fn_104]And the question that remained unanswered, which the scientific community hadlittle interest in investigating, was why all these people were sick withdiseases like cancer, ME/CFS, and autism.To Mikovits, the path was a straight line. A scientist should investigate humandisease, try to unlock its secrets, and when she does, figure out the quickestcourse to bring relief to those afflicted. All other issues were of secondaryconcern.The important question was how to deal with those who were sick now.Anything which kept patients with ME/CFS a single day longer in their darkenedrooms, which kept children with autism from being able to speak the thoughtsthat flashed through their overexcited brains, or that put an honest scientistin jail could only go by a simple name: evil."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURA Retrovirus in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome?It’s a classic gamma retrovirus, but it’s totally new. Nobody’s ever seen itbefore. Its closest relative is, in fact, from mice, and so we would call this axentotropic retrovirus, because it’s infecting a species other than mice . . .We’ve done it for many patients now, and we can say they’re all independentinfections.—Dr. Joseph DeRisi: “Hunting the Next Killer Virus,”February 2006, Monterey, CA, TED Talks1 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_105]Incline Village, Nevada—Summer and Fall 2006The days in Nevada fell into an efficient routine. Mikovits saw an average offive to six of Peterson’s patients a day at Sierra Internal Medicine.2[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_106] She and her team randomly numbered andentered every patient into the database to blind the clinical information theytook next and then they drew about 30 to 40 milliliters of blood. They separatedand aliquoted (portioned) the blood into plasma, sera, and pellets for DNAanalysis. After that, they mixed the samples with trizol, a chemical solutionthat preserved the nucleic acids and proteins when they were frozen.Trizol had been in use since 1987 and for many researchers it became thepreferred method for RNA/DNA/protein extraction. Even though trizol had anextremely potent and foul smell, Mikovits preferred it because it maintained RNAand protein integrity while ripping apart cells and cell components. One couldfeel comfortable going back to a sample preserved with trizol years and evendecades later, and when it was unfrozen one would see little, if any,degradation of the nucleic acids or proteins. To do longitudinal research on anepidemic such as ME/CFS, this meant that patient’s blood could be captured likea snapshot in pathogenic time.In addition to preserving the samples in trizol, Mikovits’s team would take somecells and preserve them in DMSO (Dimethyl sulfoxide, used as a cryprotectant toprevent ice formation that would cause cell death) and place them in liquidnitrogen so they could be thawed at a later date for cell growth in cultures.Peterson’s patients were scheduled to return to see him every three months andthis gave Mikovits the opportunity to collect more clinical data on each patientwith additional blood. She hoped to eventually have five or six samples fromeach person as his or her symptoms waxed and waned, spanning seasonal patterns,life stresses, and additional variants. This was important in pathogen huntingsince it helped override the natural inclination of pathogens to evade detectionas well as providing samples to reproduce any results.In addition to taking the clinical information and placing samples in the newand improved repository, Mikovits had them tested for cytokines (cell signalingmolecules that can create a disease “fingerprint” of sorts), put them on theflow cytometer to determine types of immune cells, and looked at white bloodcells under a microscope. Mikovits also used donations to purchase an expensivedatabase also used in major hospitals like Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in NewYork City (the world’s oldest and largest private cancer center). The databasewould track the master sample and then the aliquots (a portion of the originalsample) that were utilized in every study. This allowed samples to be tracedback to the exact aliquot from the master sample. Again, because preservationwas everything, the master sample would remain untouched by anything that mightcontaminate it.Mikovits was determined that nobody would ever look at her repository andquestion its organization as she had done when Byron Hsu had led her toPeterson’s original repository.* * *“It was like the great plague was moving from town to town, striking every sixmonths,” Paul Cheney later recalled. “First, there was Lake Tahoe in 1984–1985,then the small town of Yerington, Nevada, forty miles to the southeast, then sixmonths after that, Placerville, California, forty miles to the southwest.”3[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_107]This new illness was a freak show of physical abnormalities, parading itsstrange, markedly odd symptoms along a slow route of quiet towns around LakeTahoe and the Sierra Nevadas near where the famous Donner party met in 1846 withhorrific catastrophe including starvation, exposure, disease, hypothermia, andcannibalism, as they were cut off from both the East and the West.Eleven years after these outbreak, journalist Hillary Johnson published thedefinitive narrative of this modern calamity in a 700-plus page book calledOsler’s Web: Inside the Labyrinth of the Chronic Fatigue Epidemic. Johnsonchronicled the government’s lackluster, oftentimes nefarious, response to thethen-emerging disease, beginning with a near day-by-day recounting of theoutbreak in Incline Village, Nevada. Johnson’s description of the extraordinarylengths to which Cheney and Peterson went to unravel the mysteries of thedisease is worth revisiting because the doctors ultimately arrived—much likeMikovits two decades later—at a retroviral hypothesis.As Johnson reports, Peterson was a well-trained internal medicine specialist whoset up a private practice in Incline Village after paying for his medicaleducation by serving as a clinician to an impoverished population of migrantsand farm workers in Idaho.4 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_108] Cheney, at thetime, was nearing the end of his Air Force enlistment and serving as the chiefof medicine at Mountain Home Air Force Base Hospital.5[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_109]After learning that Peterson was looking for a partner, Cheney decided to visitthe Peterson clinic for a week, discovered that he liked the picturesque areaand the surprisingly sophisticated practice, and joined Peterson in October1983.The exceptional natural beauty of the region was a given and the economicopportunities were abundant, especially since Cheney and Peterson were the onlytwo board-certified physicians in Lake Tahoe.6[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_110] The doctors ran what many locals consideredthe “powerhouse practice” in town, according to Johnson. Rapidly, they becamethe doctors of choice in the exclusive community where most people had theability to see any doctor in the world.In October of 1984, however, Cheney and Peterson began to see an unusual groupof patients, starting with the girls’ basketball team of a local high school,several of whom complained of what seemed at first to be a severe case ofmononucleosis.7 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_111] In March of 1985, Johnsonwrites, the doctors began to witness large numbers of adults coming down withsimilar complaints, including teachers who shared a faculty lounge.8[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_112] Most of these patients were in theirthirties, which was atypical, as mono generally strikes adolescents and youngadults (hence why it was nicknamed the “kissing disease” due to salivarytransmission, though any contact with infected saliva can cause the disease).9[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_113]The numbers started to rise exponentially in May to June of 1985, and the twoyoung physicians were astonished by what they saw. In a series of late-eveningconversations, as described in Osler’s Web, the two were forced to face theobvious: they were witnessing a very large epidemic among formerly healthyadults, with an average age of about thirty-eight years old, occurring within asmall geographical area.10 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_114] Initially, thedisease resembled mononucleosis. Patients had sore throats, swollen glands,fever, large spleens that could be felt, and atypical lymphocytes (lymphocytesare immune cells that fight foreign invaders) on peripheral smear tests.11[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_115]In 2013 Cheney recalled, “Some cases looked like classic mono and in otherssomewhat different than mono. Something of an encephalitic onset, with severepressure headaches, light sensitivity, disorientation, and vestibularproblems.”12 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_116]While Cheney observed that the cases would initially resemble the flu or mono,when the acute phase ended there came “this extraordinary fatigue, causing themto be unable to function, and in addition, lots of cognitive issues. Troublewith word search, finding their way through traffic in a one horse town,forgetting things, having to take notes, not being able to watch TV programs orread books because they couldn’t follow the plot.”13[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_117]Eventually, Johnson continues, the doctors concluded that whatever had been intheir patients’ bloodstream “had now invaded their brains.” But what was it?Nothing in their medical training or clinical experience, Johnson noted, hadprepared the doctors for anything like this devastating disease.* * *A critical turning point in Johnson’s narrative occurred when Cheney andPeterson sent their blood samples to Susan Wormsley, a biochemist and flowcytometry expert at Cytometrics Laboratory in San Diego. Flow cytometryquantifies and qualifies the condition of the immune system cells.14[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_118] Wormsley told Johnson:“Right from the time we separated and stained the cells, we saw a lot ofdebris,” she said. “Just broken-apart cells, pieces of cells and platelets. Andwe don’t see that in anything else that gets sent to us. Now, naturally, witheverything that is sent to us, the people are sick, and most of them havecancer-leukemia, lymphoma—but we didn’t see this kind of debris except in thesepatients.”15 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_119]As Wormsley explained to Johnson, the answer was clear. Some type of virus ortoxin had to be killing the cells of these patients.16[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_120]But there was another issue. In order to perform one of the tests, thekappa/lambda test, the researchers needed a good portion of B cells in theirsamples.17 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_121]“Right from the beginning,” she tells Johnson, “these people seemed to haveextremely low percentages [of B-cells], sometimes only one or two percent oftheir white blood cell population instead of the eight to twelve percent that wenormally see. I noticed it because with a normal person, ten milliliters ofblood gives you plenty of cells to do the entire assay. But I wasn’t able to getenough B-cells to feel comfortable with Paul’s patients.”18[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_122]Another abnormality found in these unusual patients involved the ratio of T-cellsubsets, Johnson writes.19 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_123] T-cells are animmune system cell which regulates production of disease fighting antibodies.Scientists recognize two distinct types of T-cells, “helper” T-cells which boostantibody production, and “suppressor” cells which suppress antibody production.The ratio for a healthy person is one helper T-cell to every two or threesuppressor T-cells. The helper cells are like new police recruits anxious foraction, while the suppressor T-cells are like the seasoned captains who would bemore cautious in the use of force. With AIDS, HIV piggybacks onto the CD4receptor on T-cells and works its way into the cells, turning them into virusfactories to reproduce itself and render the cells useless against infection.From Osler’s Web:“One of the most striking immunological aberrations Wormsely observed, however,was abnormal ratios of T-cell subsets. T-cells are a major category of immunesystem cell: they regulate production of disease-fighting antibodies. Twoprimary T-cell subsets are “helper” and “suppressor” T-cells, which boost andsuppress antibody production, respectively. In AIDS the normal ratio tends to bedramatically skewed in favor of suppressors. Since this finding is virtuallydiagnostic of AIDS, Cheney and Peterson were curious to know the T-cell subsetprofile in the Tahoe malady.Wormsley’s results showed that four of five Tahoe patients did have abnormalhelper suppressor ratios. But unlike the ratios in AIDS sufferers, they were lowin the number of suppressor cells. Instead of one-to-two or one-to-three, whichare typical of healthy people, the Incline patients had helper-suppressor ratiosof five-to-one, ten-to-one, and higher. It was the mirror image of AIDS.(italics by authors)”20 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_124]Could there be a more frightening description of a disease? In AIDS the immunesystem was told to essentially “stand-down,” allowing all sorts of pathogens torun wild. By contrast, in ME/CFS it seemed that the immune system was instructedto go into “full-attack mode,” indiscriminately wiping out the good with thebad.The delicate balance of the immune system had been broken.* * *Cheney and Peterson investigated whether this low suppressor/high helper T-cellratio had been observed before and learned it was extremely rare.21[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_125]“Peterson and Cheney began using the curious helper-suppressor ratio as yetanother laboratory abnormality—in addition to the abnormal Epstein-Barr virusantibody profile—to support their diagnosis of the disease. It was a fragilestand, they knew, and they were uncertain of its significance. Yet, it was real,and it was not normal.”22 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_126]The elevated rate of another rare lymphoma, Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL),increased Mikovits’s curiosity about ME/CFS when she saw Peterson’s presentationat the HHV-6 Conference in Barcelona, Spain. Mikovits would come to believe thatthe development of lymphomas represented a long-term progression and finaloutcome of the cellular damage wreaked by a retrovirus.The same idea had occurred to Cheney decades earlier, when HIV/AIDS was still alargely untreated pandemic. The saying, “If it looks like a duck, quacks like aduck” surely applied to what they were witnessing. Both of them could see aretroviral duck, one that quacked too loudly for a dissimilar decoy: now theyneeded to find the location of the pond.* * *Cheney wasted no time pursuing the retroviral hypothesis. The doctor knew thatthere was a commercial test for one other human retrovirus besides HIV, and thatwas HTLV-1, the human T-cell leukemia-lymphoma virus 1, discovered by FrankRuscetti and Bernie Poiesz in Gallo’s lab.Cheney sent five samples to a Specialty Lab in Los Angeles, Johnson writes,noting that the samples came from five patients who could not be classified asamong the worst or the least affected, and two of them were teachers from theoutbreak at an elementary school. The prevalence rate in the North Americanpopulation for HTLV-1 was predicted to be about .031 percent, but four of thefive samples (80 percent) turned out to be positive.Cheney and Peterson thought they had landed their retrovirus. But as reported inOsler’s Web, a second and a third test of the samples turned out negative,raising the possibility that their first results were false positives. Cheneywas undeterred, certain he was on the trail of what caused the disease. One ofhis colleagues referred him to Dr. Elaine DeFreitas of the Wistar Institute, thenation’s first independent biomedical research facility, founded in Philadelphiain 1892.DeFreitas was initially reluctant to enter into a new collaboration. During aninterview with Johnson, she described her early interactions with Cheney:“What he was telling me about these patients was fascinating, and his theoriesand his experiments were very interesting. And he seemed absolutely convincedthat there was a retrovirus involved in this. And I would tell him, ‘I’m[working] on multiple sclerosis. I can only handle one disease at a time.’ Buthe was so persistent. Finally I decided that the quickest way of shutting him upwas to take five or six patients, run the samples—to do what I could with themhere. And they were all going to be negative—I was absolutely convinced ofit.”23 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_127]It took several months before Cheney heard back from DeFreitas. He learned thathis samples had been passed along to the Gallo lab at the National CancerInstitute. Gallo’s lab was puzzled because they had been finding antibodies to anew virus in a handful of different illnesses. When they got to Cheney’ssamples, they found all of them were infected by this new virus.The new virus was human herpes-virus #6 (HHV-6) and Gallo claimed its discoveryin the journal Science on October 31, 1986.24[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_128]As mentioned before, HHV-6 confused scientists for the next twenty years as towhether it caused disease or was just one more pathogen that appeared likewildfire in the system of these immune-compromised patients. It might be likethe causative virus of Kaposis’s sarcoma (Human herpes virus-8) was discoveredin men with HIV infections who also had KS, just as it previously had been foundin the aging, dysfunctional immune systems of certain old men.HHV-6 was the virus Mikovits would hear about in a yacht club in southernCalifornia in 2006, forcing her to abruptly change course like a mariner headinginto a perfect storm.* * *Paul Cheney first met Judy Mikovits on a mountaintop Buddhist retreat about twoand a half hours north of San Francisco.25 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_129]Nestled in the California wine country, the Ratna Ling (Buddhist for “health”)Retreat Center is located on 120 acres of redwood forests in the coastal range,about a mile away from the Pacific Ocean. Among the towering redwoods andfog-shrouded ridges of Sonoma County, Ratna Ling plays host several times a yearto a unique gathering of scientists and medical researchers.The driving force behind this series of ongoing conferences under the gorgeouspost and beam space of Ratna Ling was a wealthy San Francisco businessman whoconverted to Tibetan Buddhism and then poured money into this small heathretreat. When his wife came down with ME/CFS, he formed a consortium of the bestminds in related medical and research fields and invited them to Ratna Ling. Asa business big shot who had created a successful algorithm for the world’seconomy, his guiding principle was to get smart people with diverse ideas intothe same room, and let those ideas percolate.Cheney recalled, “The first conference was thirty people and it was one of thegreatest intellectual experiences of my life. I got to see in front of me allthe best thinking in one room. It was very collegial. It was a Buddhist temple:you had to take your shoes off, and we ate vegetarian meals. There were no cellphones, televisions, radios, or anything. Each of us presented for about twentyminutes. Then people around the room would make comments and have a discussion.It was very respectful of other views, even if they were the exact opposite ofyours.“And I learned a lot. I became comfortable with certain aspects of what Ibelieved, and saw flaws in my own thinking. It was wonderful. This was repeatedevery few months. The next one was on Lyme disease, the one after that wasautism, and then there was one on autoimmunity. If you were invited to anysingle conference you could attend any of the other ones. I attended the one onchronic fatigue syndrome and the one on autism because I had findings on autismto share. Judy spoke at the chronic fatigue syndrome conference, and that’swhere I met her.”Cheney went onto say he was respectful of Mikovits’s passion, intelligence, andknowledge of the field.26 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_130] They wouldcontinue to stay in touch and he would be one of the first people Mikovits wouldtell when something very exciting had been found in the disease which he hadstudied for so long.27 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_131]* * *At the Ratna Ling Conference on chronic fatigue syndrome, Cheney also met Dr.Joseph Burrascano, a prominent Lyme disease expert who co-authored theInternational Lyme and Associated Diseases Society (ILADS) guidelines fortreatment and diagnosis of Lyme and related coinfections. Cheney rapidly bondedwith Burrascano, respecting the physician’s intellect as well as his passionatebut even temperament.28 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_132]Burrascano told Cheney that he had treated acute Lyme disease on Long Islandwhere the disease is highly endemic, for a decade between 1970 and 1980. Thepatients presented with the standard known tick bite, bull’s-eye rash, and acuteillness that resolved with the medication Doxycycline. Not one of these casesadvanced into chronic Lyme disease in those days. But around 1980, somethingchanged in his practice. Patients started getting a new disease, a chronic Lymedisease that did not go away.It reminded Cheney of a time in 1987 when he attended a conference in Portland,Oregon, with about fifteen other clinicians treating ME/CFS patients.29[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_133] The moderator asked the clinicians to raisehands to note the year when they first began to see large numbers of ME/CFScases in their practices. The moderator called out 1978 and nobody raised ahand. The same thing with 1979: not one hand. For 1980, two hands popped up. Onewas from a clinician in the San Francisco Bay Area and the other was from NewYork City, the two areas that were the epicenters of the AIDS epidemic.This revelation made Cheney think more deeply about the pathogenesis of ME/CFS.What did it mean that San Francisco and New York City presented with the firstincreases in these illnesses? Aside from high rents, coastal proximity,international airports, large diverse émigré populations, and foodie cuisine,what did these two cities have in common? It was mysterious.Most viruses strike the young or the old, but whatever was at the heart of thisdisease was striking those in adolescence and early adulthood. Few over fiftyyears of age came down with it, and it certainly wasn’t rampaging throughnursing homes. Kids in elementary schools were not sneezing on each other’s milkcartons and causing large outbreaks in their schools. Whatever was initiatingthe problem seemed to require a robust immune system to counterattack it, whichwas similar to the profile of those struck down by mononucleosis (caused by theherpes virus, Epstein Barr), hence perhaps they were witnessing a herpes virusor the destruction of an otherwise-intact adult immunity. Cheney felt it waslikely that ME/CFS was an epi-phenomenon of the AIDS epidemic. He consideredHHV-6, type A, a likely causative candidate, but also thought HHV-6A may haverecombined to some degree with the HIV retrovirus. Both HHV-6A and HIV couldreadily infect the same type of cell.Cheney was also intrigued by a paper he read from Dr. Patricia Coyle of theState University of New York at Stony Brook in which she compared many of thefeatures of chronic Lyme disease and ME/CFS and found that a large number of theclinical markers of the two were indistinguishable.30[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_134]Many autism doctors later asserted that Lyme played a significant role inautism31 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_135] and Cheney soon saw an overlap ofboth of these conditions with ME/CFS.In February of 2011, however, Dr. Steven E. Schultzer’s research team of NewJersey along with Dr. Richard D. Smith of the Pacific Northwest NationalLaboratory published in the journal PLOS ONE that chronic Lyme disease (whichthey called Neurologic Post Treatment Lyme disease) and ME/CFS patientspresented with unique, measurable proteins in their spinal fluids—different fromeach other, and different from controls.32 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_136]Was it possible, then, that Lyme (caused by a spirochete) was not unlikesyphilis (caused by a spirochete) in untreated AIDS—a coinfection that furtheredthe retroviral damage?Of what transpired with Mikovits and the controversy over XMRV, Cheney wouldsay, “I truly do believe with the results she got from the spleen-focus formingvirus antibody test [designed to detect known and undiscovered mouse xenotropicretroviruses], that there’s something there. We just don’t know what it is. Isuppose it’s possible that it’s a human endogenous retrovirus that’s active,making an envelope protein and a gag protein. It could be a novelgamma-retrovirus, yet to be discovered. It could be a piece of HIV stuck in aherpes virus, making it a cross between a retrovirus and a herpes virus. Themost likely virus for that would be HHV-6, since it integrates into the humanDNA, just like retroviruses do. So we could have a cross of some kind.”33[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_137]“I don’t know what this is,” Cheney said. “But I sure as hell know what thisdisease is. It’s very coherent. You can measure it by objective standards thatare not found in control groups and cannot be explained by normal medicine.”34[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_138]* * *Even before Annette Whittemore met Mikovits, she was interested in Dr. JosephDeRisi’s invention called the ViroChip35 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_139](which had first identified XMRV in the tumors of prostate cancer patients in200636 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_140]) for the ME/CFS patients, includingher daughter.37 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_141]The ViroChip was a single diagnostic assay that contained a genetic sequence forevery known virus and that also had the ability to identify novel viruses. Ithad evolved out of a marriage of virology and technology and was expected tomore rapidly advance the science of viral detection. DeRisi had discovered XMRValong with Dr. Robert Silverman of the prestigious Cleveland Clinic, who wouldlater come to play a crucial role in their work.38[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_142]Annette told Judy she had written a letter to DeRisi inquiring about using thechip, but she never received a reply. After Mikovits started working withPeterson, Mikovits revived the ViroChip idea, but the two groups were unable tocome to an agreement.At the National Cancer Institute, there was a similar chip developed by themolecular technologies program. Ruscetti had access to it and the NCI wasfortuitously looking for investigators willing to try it. This option seemedlike a good opportunity, but one the research team would later come to regret.There were entire virus families that were not represented on the chip,including some in the XMRV family. A retrovirus virus might have something like9,000 base nucleotide pairs in its genetic makeup, some of which were quicklyevolving and others which were not. Among animals, even small genetic variationscreate wildly different species. For example, a human and a chimp vary in theirgenetic makeup by approximately 2 percent, but nobody would ever identify themas the same species.39 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_143]However, an RNA virus can vary in its genetic makeup by a much greaterpercentage and still be considered the same species. The different subtypes ofHIV differ by 25–30 percent while the viruses in a specific subtype themselvescan typically differ by 10–15 percent.40 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_144] Atypical assay might have only 50–200 base nucleotide pairs in its sequence todetermine the identity of a certain virus. It was therefore critical in creatingan accurate assay to determine which stretches of the viral genome were notevolving, or—in the parlance of virologists—which were conserved.About a year after they settled on the NCI chip that first summer of 2006,Mikovits did some additional research, talking with Dr. Ian Lipkin, the head ofColumbia University’s Institute of Infection and Immunity.41[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_145] Lipkin thought that both the NCI and DeRisichips were flawed. Lipkin articulated at length about the technology he haddeveloped and why it was better than either chip.Even though Mikovits did not understand every technical detail, she was able todiscern that Lipkin did indeed have the superior technology.42[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_146] But their experiments were already wellunderway and it would have been unethical for Lipkin to intervene in theresearch at such a time. In retrospect, Mikovits wished she had learned aboutLipkin’s technology before she used the NCI chip with Peterson’s top 70 samplesand as a component of the Integrative Neural Immune Program’s (INIP) IntramuralResearch award investigation. This knowledge might have radically altered thecourse of events.Dr. Dennis Taub and Frank Ruscetti cowrote a grant proposal for the INIPprogram, looking at the role of chronic inflammation stimulation by an activeherpes virus infection, and what role this might have in the development ofimmune dysfunction and mantle cell lymphoma in ME/CFS patients. The work wouldbe done with the samples Mikovits had prepared for Peterson the summer of 2006.The proposal was awarded three years of funding in September of 2007—six monthsbefore she would discuss chip technology with Lipkin.Less than a year since Mikovits set forth her plan, a new era of research intoME/CFS was barreling ahead.* * *As Mikovits worked on building a program to unravel the mystery of ME/CFS, shebecame acutely aware of the influence wielded by the Whittemores in Nevada. Inthe fall of 2006 the Whittemores threw a themed “I Hope You Dance Fundraiser”(since few ME/CFS patients could dance any more) at the Peppermill Casino inReno, a coffee shop turned gaming center when the owners partnered with theSeeno family in 1979. The event featured the legendary singer Joan Baez. Theevent was populated by Nevada royalty: most of the state’s congressionaldelegation, the current and former governor of Nevada, and US Senate MajorityLeader, Harry Reid, with his wife and four sons. Senator Reid received a specialaward for his support of the institute and Joan Baez gave him an autographedguitar from her collection.43 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_147] Futurehonorees included Governor Kenny Guinn, State Senator Bill Raggio, and RonParraguirre, who would be appointed Navada Supreme Court Chief Justice in2010.44 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_148]In late fall of 2007, Mikovits organized the WPI’s first Scientific Retreathosted by the Whittemores at Red Hawk for a number of notable scientists in thefield, including Drs. Nancy Klimas and Suzanne Vernon, as well as others fromthe UNR, many of whom possessed appropriate skill sets to figure out how toattack this problem. The group included immunologists, virologists,microbiologists, and any other field that Mikovits felt might conceivably beable to offer some assistance.Afterward, everybody drove out to the Whittemore’s Lakeshore house. There atGlenbrook, Mikovits was first formally introduced to Harry Reid, who seemed tobe an unpretentious man. He didn’t overpower a room the way Harvey did, and itwasn’t just because Harvey towered over the Senator in height.Mikovits was not interested in politics. Her husband David did like rousingconversation about politics and history, and thus was thrilled to engage withthe Senator. Over the years that Mikovits worked in Nevada, the Reids were acommon fixture at Whittemore events.* * *In 2005, prior to the arrival of Mikovits, the Whittemores had persuaded theNevada Legislature to unanimously pass Senate Bill 105, which appropriated tenmillion dollars to the University of Nevada, School of Medicine, the NevadaCancer Institute, and the Whittemore Peterson Institute.45[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_149] Harvey pledged to contribute two milliondollars to this effort as well as raise an additional two million from friendsand associates. These donations comprised the initial seed money for what wouldlater become the Center for Molecular Medicine at UNR, to house the WPI.In 2007 Mikovits joined Harvey and Annette in advocating for and securingpassage of Senate Bill 443, which set aside two million dollars for theconstruction of a facility dedicated to the research and treatment ofneuroimmune disorders, as well as providing money for equipment andfurnishings.46 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_150] The legislature also providedfunds for continued operational funding for the WPI in their legislation.On January 14, 2008, Annette Whittemore wrote a glowing letter to Mikovits onwhat had transpired in the past year and a half, noting that Judy had taken theprogram from a small, one-room office to a first class research laboratory.47[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_151]Annette’s tone belied her genuine warmth for her friend and colleague and—as shewould have put it—her new family member. Mikovits also received a check fortwenty thousand dollars, her annual bonus. She felt she had earned every pennyof it.* * *Another intriguing clue to unraveling the riddle of ME/CFS came in a paperpublished in 2005 by Belgian researcher, Dr. Kenny de Meirleir.48[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_152] De Meirleir reported that the RNase L enzymein ME/CFS patients wasn’t working effectively. This meant that patients wouldhave a reduced ability to defend against an RNA virus or retrovirus.It was a simple, yet crippling defect in the immune system.Mikovits and her team worked in 2007 and 2008 on developing tests to monitorcytokine and chemokine (a family of small cytokines) levels of the patients.Unlike in HIV, T cells from ME/CFS patients were not dying in culture. It wasmore like HTLV-1 which could be latent in T cells for decades without killingthem and still cause a neurological disease, HTLV-1 associatedmyelopathy/tropical spastic parapersis (HAM/TSP.) Only rarely (<5 percent of thecases) did HTLV-1 infection transform the T-cells, causing leukemia or result inHAM/TSP. Now they had found two ways in which ME/CFS patients’ immune systemswere dysregulated similar to patients with HAM/TSP, the dysfunction ofRuscetti’s plasmacytoid dendritic cells and the inflammatory cytokinesignatures.Her perspective began to solidify in October of 2007 when she and a postdoctoralresearcher who had recently graduated from the UNR—Dr. Vincent Lombardi—attendedthe Michael Milken Prostate Cancer meeting in Incline Village.49[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_153]Lombardi had already received a fifty thousand dollar grant to study RNase L andprostate cancer from the Nevada Cancer Institute. At the Milken meeting inOctober 2007, he first met Robert Silverman of the Cleveland Clinic (thescientist who is credited with discovering XMRV in prostate cancer cells) anddiscussed the research with him. In March of 2008 Silverman sent him somereagents including the plasmid containing XMRV clone to test his material.Mikovits had helped Lombardi with some of the design of his experiments for theprostate cancer grant, but they had been so busy working on ME/CFS that Lombardihadn’t actually been able to get caught up and do the work. Silverman’s reagentssat in the freezer for close to six months.50[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_154]Mikovits was familiar with Silverman as they had both worked in prostate cancerresearch and also attended meetings of the American Association of CancerResearcher prostate cancer meetings. He was an immunologist, with an expertisein the type 1 interferon pathway in cancer. Silverman’s poster presentation atthe Milken event was on the RNASEL genetic defects in prostate cancer patientswho tested positive for the newly discovered XMRV retrovirus. Mikovits attendedthe conference, displaying a poster on behalf of the biotech company for whomshe had consulted, showing how their drugs affected inflammation and cytokinesignatures of disease. They had some early research on how these drugs worked onME/CFS patients not shown on the poster but was the topic of their privateconversations.Little interest was displayed in Silverman’s and Mikovits’s posters so the twoof them along with Lombardi had some time to talk then, and she just happened tobe displaying her poster next to Silverman’s. It was a fortuitous collision ofthinking. A quick perusal of the two posters showed some intriguingsimilarities.Mikovits’s work showed high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines,such as IL6, chemokine IL-8, and they showed disregulation on interferonalpha.51 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_155] Mikovits, Silverman, and Lombardiwere all intrigued by the abnormalities in RNase L pathway because it mightexplain why the patients had so many chronic viral infections. Maybe they weredealing with a retrovirus that had some similarities to HIV and HTLV-1. CouldSilverman’s XMRV explain the differing results?Mikovits was somewhat skeptical that Silverman’s reagents would find this newlydiscovered retrovirus in her patient population. Mikovits recalled that themicroarray was showing an elevated expression of just about every virus, as ifsomething had thrown the immune system out of control.52[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_156] But the subjects weren’t obviously dyinglike AIDS patients, and aside from the increased incidence of certain types oflymphomas, they weren’t developing cancer, although Hillary Johnson haddocumented other cancers—such as salivary gland cancers—in the patientpopulations elsewhere.53 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_157]When they got back to their lab, Mikovits and Lombardi instructed a new graduatestudent, Max Pfost, to do some PCR testing using Silverman’s reagents. Mikovitshad a dual role at the WPI, also serving as an adjunct professor in severaldepartments at UNR, working extensively with students and teaching them theproper and thorough way to do a scientific investigation so that they would comeaway with foundational knowledge.Max Pfost would go onto become one of Mikovits’s closest colleagues and theywould develop almost a mother-son type relationship.54[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_158] Pfost was not quite cut from the same clothas many of the other graduate students, sporting bike racing tattoos on hisright arm, along with a quote in Latin from the 1980s film, American Flyers,which read res firma mitescere nescit, or “a firm resolve is not easilybroken.”55 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_159]On Max’s left arm the subject was science. He had illustrations of DNA proteinsbeing translated, immune cells, B cells, anti-bodies being secreted, and veinswith viruses exploding out of them.56 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_160] Whenthe debates between Mikovits and Coffin over XMRV became heated, Max had a smallcoffin tattooed on his middle right finger, so that if he ever met Coffin andwent to shake his hand, the veteran researcher would know just what Max thoughtof him.57 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_161]When Mikovits worked with Max, they picked out samples from twenty of thesickest patients, including several diagnosed with lymphoma, and she asked himto do PCR on the samples.58 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_162] Most of thesamples came back negative.But two or three were positive.However, the bands were the wrong sizes, meaning there could possibly be arelated virus. If she had been at a typical lab with a well-trained staff, shemight have simply thrown those samples out, figuring something went wrong in theexperiment.59 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_163] She might have returned to thecytokines, chemokines, RNase L, natural killer cells, or something elseentirely, and conclude that there was not a novel virus in the samples.But because she was teaching a young researcher she followed the most rigorouspractices and asked Max to sequence the bands. Another nagging doubt in her mindwas that some of the bands were quite bright, a strong positive signal. When theresults came back they contained sequences of Silverman’s XMRV retrovirus. Therewere some deletions at curious places and other inconsistencies, but if onealigned the sequences in just a certain way the pattern looked like XMRVgag—that is, sequences translated into a structural protein of XMRV (gagpolyproteins are used in the viral replication cycle of a retrovirus).60[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_164] It was like a Christmas tree lighting up.Mikovits showed Pfost how to optimize the PCR, how to ever so slightly vary theannealing temperature so that he could find everything that was closely related.Mikovits was not looking for a stringent match, but more of a loose associationthat might suggest they were looking at a taxonomic family member to XMRV.Lowering the stringency of the PCR changed everything.61[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_165]They found a lot of samples in the group of twenty ME/CFS patients withsequences highly similar to XMRV gag. They pulled an additional thirty samplesand tested them under the loosened PCR standard. A number of those were positiveas well. They tested samples that had been taken at different intervals from asingle individual.In doing this, they frequently found patients who tested negative in one sample,but positive in another.62 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_166] Both virallatency and methylation issues could (at least temporarily) conceal the presenceof a virus from PCR tests.This interesting implication that ME/CFS patients could be positive for XMRV wassomething they felt compelled to discuss with Silverman and Ruscetti. She hopedshe could convince Frank to come for a holiday in San Diego and show him thepreliminary data. If Ruscetti thought the preliminary data was compelling, theyhad a green light.* * *They met in January of 2009 in San Diego during a meeting of the AmericanAssociation of Cancer Research (AACR) special focus Prostate Cancer meeting,first to sign a confidential disclosure agreement regarding XMRV and the recentdata generated by Pfost and Lombardi in the Mikovits lab.63[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_167]After signing the agreement, Lombardi and Mikovits showed the preliminary datato Silverman and Ruscetti to see if the two experts felt the data warranted acollaboration. The four of them—Mikovits, Ruscetti, Lombardi, andSilverman—agreed early on to authorship of the paper. Lombardi would be firstauthor and Mikovits would be senior author, as is customary for a post doctoralfellow developing the mentor’s research hypothesis under her direction.The agreement they ended up signing on January 20 stated that the ClevelandClinic had “novel assays to detect xenotropic murine leukemia virus-relatedvirus (XMRV) infections in humans” and that both the National Cancer Instituteand the Whittemore Peterson Institute had “certain confidential informationrelating to detection of XMRV in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome.”64[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach4fn_168] The esteemed Cleveland Clinic, the iconicNCI, and the still-formative WPI (which did not yet have a building, just aborrowed lab) were going to commence a pivotal study on whether the XMRV viruswas associated with ME/CFS.It had been a wild, two-and-a-half year ride for Mikovits. Now she and hercolleagues were on a virology big game hunt.They were on the hunt for a retrovirus."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVEThe Appearance of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Autism in the Medical LiteratureFrom these experiments, it appears that of all the ordinary laboratory animals,the mouse should be the best in attempting to produce poliomyelitis, for thevirus survives in its brain for a longer time than in that of the guinea pig,rabbit, or rat.1 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_169]—Dr. Maurice Brodie of the New YorkDepartment of Health, in 1935, reporting onexperiments with his experimental polio vaccine.Accordingly the virus in the form of an injected suspension of mouse brain wasintroduced into several of these cultures of human tissue which were thenhandled exactly as in the experiment with the mumps agent.2[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_170]—Nobel Prize Lecture, December 11, 1954Attempting to identify the first outbreak or even the first patient with a newdisease (often referred to as “patient zero”) can be as frustrating as it is fora homicide investigator trying to solve a cold case. Defying the staid image ofscience as a measured progression of small steps, the exercise may look like theantithesis of scientific method, involving wild leaps of speculation, departurefrom evidentiary reason, and even a radical reinterpretation of subjects oncethought to be well-understood.Early AIDS investigation is a good example. New cases of the disease startedcropping up in the early 1980s among gay men. These men were often dying ofKaposi’s sarcoma (KS), a cancer that had, up to that point, typically struckelderly Jewish or Italian men.3 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_171] In Decemberof 1981, a gay man named Bobbi Campbell posted Polaroid snapshots of thepurplish KS lesions in his mouth and throat and on his torso in the window ofStar Pharmacy in San Francisco’s gay mecca, the Castro District. He warned othergay men that something ominous was spreading around, and those who witnessed hisstark admonition reported being chilled to the bone, sensing the community wastipping into a terrifying new era. A few years later, as the “gay cancer” spreadthrough the district like wildfire, Star Pharmacy hung a plaque on their wallnoting that they had reached a prescription sales record.4[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_172]The Jewish and Italian men who contracted this normally benign cancer wouldusually die with the unsightly but not fatal Kaposi’s sarcoma lesions but bekilled by other causes. These new atypical KS patients, on the other hand, alsosuffered from a staggering array of atypical ailments such as pneumocystispneumonia that were generally not so virulent but were rapidly fatal in thispopulation. The investigators tried to see if they could uncover any commonlinks between the earliest cases of KS in gay men. Eventually they were able tofind a “patient zero,” a charming, hypersexual French-Canadian airline stewardand athlete named Gaëtan Dugas who frequented gay bathhouses in New York and SanFrancisco, and had also traveled overseas.5 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_173]The “little black book” of Dugas held the names and numbers of many of the firstcluster of AIDS cases in the United States, whom researchers were then able tolink to other cases.* * *Shortly after the publication of her October 2009 article in the journalScience, Mikovits attended a conference in January, 2010 of Defeat Autism Now!(DAN) doctors. These medical professionals held the opinion that a trifecta ofgenetics, infection, and toxins caused autism. Some of the DAN doctors focusedon genetics, others on bacterial or viral infections, and others on ubiquitoustoxins like mercury or lead. They shared the belief that autism spectrumdiseases (ASD) resulted from some combination of these elements, creating aperfect storm. Mikovits had long been curious about a connection between ME/CFSand autism, as her team had preliminary data for what appeared to be a higherthan expected number of children with autism among ME/CFS patients and theirfamilies.* * *On June 14, 1934, the train carrying Dr. John R. Paul—a small, wiry Yale MedicalSchool professor with a fierce intellect—and Dr. Leslie Webster—a tall,good-looking physician from the Rockefeller Institute with a Clark Gablemustache—was met at the Pasadena rail station by Dr. George Parrish, City HealthOfficer for Los Angeles. The men were immediately whisked to the Mayor’soffice.6 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_174] High officials of the beleaguered,polio-stricken city of Los Angeles welcomed them as saviors.In a letter written to his wife on the day after his arrival, Dr. Paul recountedthe journey and the pandemonium that greeted their arrival.7[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_175]As we commenced to get Los Angeles papers, we realized we had newspaper troublesahead. A telegram was received requesting that we disembark at Pasadena. Therewe were met by the City Health Commissioner, Dr. Parrish and his aides. We weretold they had sidetracked us at Pasadena because of the size of the crowd at theterminal. Then they said the Mayor was waiting to receive us and award us theFreedom of the City. I said “Positively we will not give out statements, we camehere to work: leave us alone.”The scientists were treated like heroes before they had done a single lab testand they must have felt like the stars of their own movie.After dinner, the Police Commissioner of Los Angeles gave us his private car andwe were driven at breakneck speed with red lights, policeman’s radio, and sirengoing full blast. We skipped all traffic stops and just roared 18 miles toHollywood’s Greatest Premier Move Theater, where the great owner, Sam Grauman,gave us complimentary seats. He held up the main show 3 minutes to meet us. Myfeelings cannot be committed to paper!!!8 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_176]The Los Angeles Times gave a clear account of what the two men planned toaccomplish on their journey to the west.It is the plan of the two physicians, with the assistance of Dr. James F. Trask,of Yale Medical Institute, who will arrive Sunday, to undertake extensivelaboratory tests and research in an effort to isolate the poliomyelitis virusand through inoculation experiments with monkeys seek prevention of the diseasein the interest of humanity.9 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_177]They were men of science in the City of Dreams. They didn’t know it, but inaddition to polio, they were about to witness the first recorded outbreak ofME/CFS.* * *Paul and Webster were part of a second wave to arrive in Los Angeles from NewYork City. They were there to observe a polio epidemic as it swept the city and,if possible, gain valuable information about it. One physician, however, wasinterested in protecting the doctors and nurses who were on the front lines ofthe terrifying epidemic.Dr. Maurice Brodie, a young Canadian physician working at the New York CityHealth Department and at New York University,10[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_178] had developed a polio vaccine. According toan account in the popular magazine The Literary Digest, the funds for Brodie’swork came “partly from the Warm Springs Foundation, in which PresidentRoosevelt, himself a sufferer from infantile paralysis at the age of forty, isthe moving spirit. The rest is being contributed by the Rockefeller Foundationand the New York Foundation.”11 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_179]Brodie had reputable support from the president’s own charity in addition to theRockefeller and New York Foundation. Talk about a trifecta: the researcher couldnot have had more powerful patrons than the president and the country’swealthiest charities. Brodie later detailed the process of creating his poliovaccine, which consisted of up to forty-five passages of the virus through mice,and noted:The passage material was a mixture of 1 part of active virus and 4 parts of asuspension of mouse brain and brain stem. The material from the 24th and 45thpassages injected into a series of mice in multiple inoculations, produced noeffect in the mice nor did the virus in either of these passages survive for alonger time than in the preliminary experiment, when it was demonstrated in themouse brain, 3 but not 5 days after intracerebral injection.12[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_180]Trials of the Brodie vaccine were subsequently conducted in North Carolina,Virginia, and California, and included 7,000 children13[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_181] in addition to the “300 nurses andphysicians” from the Los Angeles County Hospital.14[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_182]* * *In a later account of the 1934 Los Angeles epidemic, Paul seemed conflictedabout the polio outbreak as well as the undefined new disease he witnessed. Hewrote:To sum up various opinions about the Los Angeles epidemic, there seems to belittle question that Los Angeles County was visited by an epidemic ofpoliomyelitis in the summer of 1934, although even this fact has been denied insome quarters. But a major question has been whether there was not some other,unrecognized illness combined with poliomyelitis cases, as Dr. Webster hadsuspected almost at the start of our virologic studies, and perhaps he wascorrect.15 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_183]In his account of the new disease which affected 198 nurses and physicians, Paulrelied on a later account by Dr. A. G. Gilliam, who observed that “the majorityof atypical symptoms could be described as ‘rheumatoid or influenza’ incharacter.”16 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_184] Paul noted from the beginningthat the vagueness of many of the symptoms caused some researchers to believethey were dealing with an outbreak of mass hysteria.Paul noted that there were later outbreaks of this fatiguing condition heobserved, namely in the winter of 1948 in Iceland and at the Royal Free Hospitalin London in 1954, where the condition was first referred to as a myalgicencephalomyelitis (ME), which technically translates into muscle pain (myalgic)accompanied by inflammation of the brain and spinal cord (encephalomyelitis).The similarity of the second word to poliomyelitis should not be overlooked, asthe new disease was quickly seen as polio-like.In addressing the question of whether Paul and Dr. Webster failed to properlyobserve and classify a new disease arising alongside to the Los Angeles polioepidemic of 1934 Paul wrote:Nonetheless the Los Angeles episode is a reminder that even those who believethemselves to be experts occasionally ride for a fall, although they may beextremely loathe to admit it, especially to their patients. It is sometimes thebitterest pill they have to swallow . . . As a weak excuse, it may be said thatwe had our hearts so set on isolating the poliovirus that we could think oflittle else.17 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_185]In their haste to isolate the polio virus, Paul and his team believed they mayhave overlooked a new disease in their midst.* * *What might an investigation by scientists into a virus (polio is caused by anenterovirus, it would become a model for studying the biology of RNA viruses)look like if it involved mice, monkeys, and men in the 1930s? While Brodie didnot publish extensive notes of his experiments, future generations are fortunateto have a well-documented example of the play-by-play of a similarinvestigation.This effort predates the use of the Brodie vaccine on the nurses and physiciansat Los Angeles County Hospital. It was performed by scientists working at theRockefeller Institute; scientists with whom Brodie would have had closeassociation. It was an investigation into the harrowing disease, yellow fever, aviral fever that often induces a hemorrhagic response that causes patients tobleed to death.A 1932 article by the Rockefeller Institute stated exactly what they hoped toachieve with their research: “The method here presented for vaccination againstyellow fever was devised primarily to interrupt the long series of accidentalinfections of persons making laboratory investigations.”18[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_186] Lab workers had become inadvertent soldiersin the pursuit of science and needed the “body armor” of an effective vaccine.The scientists were dying from the disease they were studying. In the four and ahalf years since researchers had started using rhesus monkeys as experimentalanimals to investigate yellow fever, there had been thirty-two infections amonglab personnel and five scientists had died.19[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_187]The concept of how to weaken a virus so that a human will produce an effectiveimmune response to protect the host rather than injure or kill the host incooperation with the virus is relatively simple. When viruses jump betweenspecies, their genetic structure undergoes changes that often make the virusmore benign. The alteration of just a few base pairs as the virus jumps cancreate an adjustment that causes a previously terrifying virus to become apathogen the body can handle with relatively little difficulty. Modern day Ebolavirus infection is a perfect example for first human infections that are rapidly100 percent lethal but after several passages in humans loses its lethality.20[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_188] However, the process can just as easily goin the opposite direction, turning a previously harmless virus into a killer.Non-endemic pathogens can also become virulently lethal in a new geographicallocation—which is why the pathogens carried by Europeans when they came to theAmericas was so predictably devastating to the native population.From early-to mid-twentieth century, directing the evolution of the world’s mostdangerous viruses through various animal species and gentling them as a rancherwould a wild horse, was the holy grail of medicine. The question that wouldhaunt researchers at the time and echo through research halls over decades waswhether in the attempt to conquer one disease a researcher might inadvertentlycreate another. This question became worth billions of dollars: failing toadequately answer it could have a devastating impact on the entire medical andscientific community.In their own words, this is what the scientists of the Rockefeller Institute didthree years before the Brodie vaccine was used by 300 nurses and physicians atLos Angeles County Hospital:The preliminary experiments with various ways of vaccinating against yellowfever seemed to show the most dependable and effective of the methods tried wasthe injection of living yellow fever virus with a simultaneous or precedinginfection of potent immune serum.Moreover, it appeared that yellow fever virus, after many passages through mice,had lost most, but not all of its virulence for monkeys, and probably for man,although retaining its power to immunize. It was proposed, therefore, to test inmonkeys the safety and the immunizing power of a vaccine composed of livingvirus fixed for mice and human immune serum, and if these tests gavesatisfactory results, to commence immunizing persons exposed to yellow fever.21[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_189]While it may surprise people today, early experiments with vaccinations wereoften coupled with attempts to boost the immune system of an individual by useof an “immune serum.” Vaccines carried the risk of overwhelming a person’simmune system, so steps were taken to increase the strength of the immune systemas a precaution.The Rockefeller researchers saw great promise in the work of their fellowcolleague in the Institute, Max Theiler, (winner of the Nobel Prize in 1951 forthe development of a vaccine against yellow fever), who had succeeded inlowering the virulence of the yellow fever virus by passaging it through mousebrain tissue:When Theiler showed that yellow fever virus which had been adapted to mice hadlost much of its virulence for monkeys, the hope was raised that the untreatedvirus in mouse-brain tissue, after enough passages in mice, would lose itsvirulence for man and would be safe to use as a vaccine.At the time of our experiments the French strain of yellow fever virus had beenthrough over 100 successive passages in mice and was nevertheless still able toproduce fever in monkeys, although it had apparently long lost its power to killthem.22 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_190]The mice seemed to be the key to weakening the virus so that it would cause afever in the rhesus monkeys when exposed to the virus (a sign that the immunesystem was attacking a pathogen), but not kill them. The generated fever showedthe immune system had been provided enough help to fight off the virus andattain immunity to future exposures of the virus by encoding it as a threat.Human testing was the next step:Sixteen persons were vaccinated against yellow fever in this laboratory, thefirst on May 13, 1931, by the methods developed with monkeys . . . The firstperson to be vaccinated was admitted to the Hospital of the RockefellerInstitute for Medical Research through the courtesy of Dr. Rufus Cole and Dr. T.M. Rivers, and was closely observed for us by Dr. G. P. Berry of the hospitalstaff . . . There were no subjective symptoms and no abnormalities oftemperature, pulse, blood pressure, heart action as shown by electrocardiogram,or urine, during 10 days in the hospital, 2 days before vaccination and 8 after.The other persons vaccinated remained on duty in the laboratory.23[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_191]Researchers at the Rockefeller Institute seemed to have established a sensibleprotocol for the yellow fever vaccine. It involved passaging the virus throughmouse tissue more than 100 times, then testing the vaccine on monkeys, and ifthat worked out without safety concerns, vaccinating humans. While this vaccinewas used for some time among researchers in African countries, eventually it wasreplaced by other vaccines that were not grown in mice.The reason?When the vaccine was injected into the brains of mice and monkeys, their brainsquickly swelled with encephalitis and they rapidly died. This was not initiallyconsidered a safety concern since vaccines were not directly injected into braintissue.The problem with the yellow fever vaccine grown in mouse brains by thescientists of the Rockefeller Institute was the subject of a presentation Dr. G.Stuart to the World Health Organization in 1953.The neurotropic strain used in this vaccine is a derivative of the pantropicFrench strain of yellow-fever virus which, during prolonged serialbrain-to-brain passage in mice as shown by Theiler to have lost its ability toproduce visceral yellow fever in rhesus monkeys—animals which, when inoculatedextraneurally with the modified virus, ordinarily developed only a mildnon-fatal infection and consequent solid immunity.At the same time, however, the modified strain had acquired an enhancedneurotropic virulence for both mice and monkeys, producing in these animals,when injected intracerebrally, a rapidly developing fatal encephalitis.24[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_192]To put it in plain language, if the vaccine was injected into the bloodstream itwould provoke a mild immune reaction, after which the subject would be immune toyellow fever. But if the vaccine components somehow migrated into the brain,they would quickly produce a fatal swelling. The problems with this vaccinegrown in mouse brain tissue were clear and Stuart addressed them in hispresentation:[T]wo main objections to this vaccine have been voiced, because of thepossibility that: (i) the mouse brains employed in its preparation may becontaminated with a virus pathogenic for man although latent in mice . . . ormay be the cause of demyelinating encephalomyelitis; (ii) the use, as antigen,of a virus with enhanced neurotropic properties may be followed by seriousreactions involving the central nervous system.25[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_193]It was all there in stark black and white (plus there was that word:“encephalomyelitis”). There were serious problems with using a vaccine developedby the passage of a human virus through animal tissues. The vaccine might pickup a virus from the mouse that was deadly to humans.This newly acquired virus could then cause the myelin sheaths, which coatneurons like the protective plastic on an electric cord, to fall apart and turnthe nerve endings to brittle threads. And the virus might make the bodyoverreact, provoking autoimmune disease in which the body attacks not aninvader, but rather turns on itself. Mikovits would make the same argumentsnearly seventy years later.Mikovits would also add the possibility that a recombination event might morphthe human and mouse viruses into another entity altogether.* * *Brodie’s once-promising polio vaccine never made it into general usage. Atwenty-year-old man vaccinated with Brodie’s polio vaccine developed paralysisin his inoculated arm and died four days later.26[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_194] According to vaccine expert Dr. Paul Offit,in his account of the Brodie vaccine trials, “Two children, five and fifteenmonths old, developed polio within two weeks of receiving inoculations.”27[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_195] The Brodie vaccine may have also induced thedeath of two-year-old Jackie Baldwin of Healdsburg, California (in SonomaCounty, north of San Francisco) in July of 1934, who died after receiving apolio vaccine administered by his father, a local physician.28[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_196] This death in California is especiallyinteresting as it took place around the mid-point of the first known ME/CFSoutbreak among the doctors and nurses at Los Angeles County Hospital.By December of 1935, many members of the medical community—such as Dr. JamesLeake of the US Public Health Service—were recommending discontinuance of theBrodie vaccine.29 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_197] Despite what had beenreported in The Literary Digest that the Warm Springs Foundation of PresidentRoosevelt had contributed funding for the development of the Brodie vaccine, inlate 1935 the foundation distanced itself from the vaccine and claimed only thatthey contributed money towards the building of a laboratory for Brodie.30[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_198]According to Offit, after 1935 Brodie found it difficult to get a new job,eventually accepting a minor, demoting position at Providence Hospital inDetroit. In May of 1939, Maurice Brodie died at the age of thirty-six of asuspected suicide.31 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_199]While Brodie’s work with an ill-fated polio vaccine may have prompted hisuntimely death in 1939, his use of mouse brain suspension to cultivate the poliovirus would result in three other researchers winning the Nobel Prize inMedicine in 1954.32 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_200]* * *The first outbreak of what would later be rebranded “chronic fatigue syndrome”started at Los Angeles County General Hospital in the late spring of 1934. Atthe time, General was a giant: the largest hospital in the world. This ME/CFSoutbreak followed a polio outbreak on the West Coast in which 2,449 suspectedcases were seen at Los Angeles County General Hospital. It was considered anunusually mild polio epidemic because so few deaths were reported.One hundred-ninety-eight doctors, nurses, and hospital staff were eventuallyafflicted with ME/CFS from May through December 15 of 1934. (Other accountsreport even higher numbers.) The disease outbreak was first thought to be poliocontracted from patients.But it was something distinct.Dr. A. G. Gilliam, an assistant surgeon for the US Public Health Service, wasdispatched to Los Angeles to investigate the large cluster outbreak. Prior tothis mission, Gilliam just happened to be investigating the efficacy of theBrodie vaccine in North Carolina.33 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_201]Gilliam’s boss was Leake, who eventually spoke out so strongly against theBrodie vaccine. Gilliam later had a distinguished career as a professor ofepidemiology at Johns Hopkins University. He wrote of the Los Angeles epidemic:These cases represent an attack rate of approximately 4.4 percent for allemployees of the General Hospital; the rate in the medical units being 4.5percent and in the osteopathic unit 1.0 percent. The personnel most severelyaffected were nurses and physicians, who suffered attack rates of 10.7 percentand 5.4 percent respectively.34 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_202]Gilliam struggled to describe the constellation of symptoms and particularly thepain of the sufferers:“The character of pain experienced varied within wide limits. It was frequentlydescribed as rheumatoid or influenza in character—an ache in the muscles orbones—but often of sufficient intensity to awaken the patient from sleep. Inmost instances it was aggravated by exercise. It was confined to no definitebody area and characteristically was variable from day to day in itsdistribution.”35 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_203]Headaches experienced by the patients were described as being “of a characterand severity never previously experienced by the patients.” The patients alsosuffered from muscle twitching, nausea, and vomiting. Other complaints includedirritability, drowsiness, stiffness in the neck or back, photophobia,constipation, and tremors. The distribution of standard neurological symptoms(twitching, irritability, photophobia) along with flu-like symptoms (nausea andvomiting) certainly matched reports by Peterson and Cheney in Incline Village,decades later (along with encephalitis and meningitis-like symptoms such asstiff neck, crushing headache, even “drowsiness” which is a dangerous sign inknown encephalitis-causing pathogens, as it can signal an approaching coma).Perhaps the most telling correlative to the more-recent Incline Village outbreakof ME/CFS, however, was the description of the condition being “aggravated byexercise.” This odd characteristic is so descriptive of ME/CFS that it has aname, “post-exertional malaise” or PEM.But the patients at the LA hospital did not recover, instead falling into apattern of lingering muscle weakness and fatigue that proved disabling. Amajority of the cluster group who tried to return to duty “subsequently foundthemselves unable to continue work and in consequence were sent off duty again,”again a portrait of modern-day ME/CFS survivors. As the Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention’s ME/CFS site states: “The majority of people with ME/CFSare affected by post-exertion malaise, which is defined as intensifying ofsymptoms following physical or mental exertion, with symptoms typicallyworsening 12–48 hours after activity and lasting for days or even weeks.” Thesite conclusively adds, “While vigorous aerobic exercise is beneficial for manychronic illnesses, CFS patients can’t tolerate traditional exercise routines.”36[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_204] At the time Gilliam compiled his findings,he reported that 55 percent of the patients were still unable to reenter thelabor force.In summarizing his report, Gilliam observed that the disease appeared to show apreference for “females rather than males, and females under 30 years of agerather than those over 30 years.” Again, this parallels the more recent ME/CFSoutbreaks. He also straddled the idea that this outbreak could be a newvariation of polio or a unique entity:The observed distribution of the disease is therefore what might have beenexpected had it been an epidemic of a disease, such as scarlet fever, spread bydirect personal contact with cases and carriers. It is quite different from whatone would have expected in an epidemic such as typhoid fever, spread bycontamination of the hospital water, milk, or food supply . . .In his report Gilliam struggles with the question of whether the disease is thepolio which is affecting the public or something completely different.Eventually he comes down on the side of believing something new has entered theworld.Irrespective of the actual mechanism of spread and of the identity of thedisease, the outbreak has no parallel in the history of poliomyelitis or othercentral nervous system infections. There is nothing in past experience with thisclass of diseases, which would have permitted anticipation of this institutionalepidemic.37 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_205]It is curious that Gilliam refers to this as an “institutional epidemic” becauseit appears to have affected solely the employees of the hospital. If it wassomething in the food, the water, or any of the other myriad items in generaluse in the hospital it would have affected both staff and patients. But itdidn’t. If affected only the staff.The critical question for any researcher is, to what was the staff exposed thatwas uniquely different from that of their patients?* * *In Osler’s Web, Hillary Johnson recounted the story told to her by Canadianphysician and researcher, Dr. Byron Hyde, who had studied Gilliam’s report andin 1988 was subsequently able to locate and interview some of the doctors whohad fallen ill during the Los Angeles out break of 1934–1935.According to Johnson, “Hyde added that there had been no medical follow-up ofany of the cases, which he suspected was the result of a legal settlementbetween the epidemic victims and the hospital. A condition of the settlement wasthat the victims refrain from discussing their ordeal publicly. The one hundredninety-eight staff members sued the hospital,” Hyde told Johnson, “andeventually settled for six million dollars in 1939, which would have purchasedthree houses for each victim in the best section of Los Angeles. Contingent onreceiving the payment was non-publicity of the epidemic.38[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_206]The value of six million dollars in 1939 would be just over one hundred milliondollars in 2014. Johnson was unable to determine whether this amount had beenpaid in full by the Los Angeles County General Hospital, or whether other groupscontributed to the settlement.Either way, it was a good chunk of money.What set of facts might have caused an organization to settle for such anamount, and what other incentives might there be for the victims of this diseaseto remain silent?In 1992 Hyde would publish a 724-page textbook, The Clinical and ScientificBasis of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome39[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_207] under the Nightingale Research Foundationthat he founded to better study the disease. He was assisted in this effort byDr. Jay Goldstein of the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Institute of Anaheim,California, as well as Dr. Paul Levine of the National Institutes of Health.While Hyde generally applauded the job Gilliam had done in characterizing theepidemic, he believed there were conspicuous omissions from Gilliam’s report,such as any sustained attempt to identify the cause of the outbreak, which wouldbe common practice in this type of investigation.Not only did Gilliam give the first clear description of the acute and subacutecharacteristics of M.E./CFS and its epidemiological factors, but his book alsoimplicitly posed a question that has been avoided and unanswered to this day.“(A) Did the 198 health care workers fall ill, or remain ill, solely as a resultof the “prophylactic serum” that Gilliam persistently documents as having beengiven, often prior to any symptom, to the majority of patients in thisepidemic?40 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_208]Could the Brodie vaccine have been the “something different” between thepatients and the staff at the hospital? From his discussion with the survivingdoctors of the 1934–1935 epidemic, Hyde believes it is the most likelypossibility. Hyde recounts what the doctors told him.. . . Gilliam told Dr. Shelokov that he had been “stymied by his superiors fromtelling the whole story” . . .If the question concerning the pooled adult serum and convalescent prophylacticserum as a potential cause of some of the pathology is not clearly stated in thetext of his book, there is ample reason for this. We know of the battle thatGilliam fought to even have the epidemic findings published. It was obvious thathe was not going to rock any more boats if he was going to see the document inprint . . .41 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_209]Hyde was interviewed in 2013 by the authors and had the following to say aboutGilliam’s work. “In the original document he [Gilliam] said it was caused bythis immunization and it was a human transfer of infectious material, so it wasactually a great experiment. He had a huge fight with the head of the publichealth system of the United States and the fight went on for almost six months.“Finally, it was agreed that he would be allowed to publish it, as long as theytook out the immunization section—because if you put the immunization in, itwould set back all Americans on immunizations for years and cause the death ofmany, many people. I think it was the theory then and it still is today. As aphysician you cannot say anything negative about immunizations, even if it’scausing problems—and they do.”42 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_210]* * *In October of 1938, Dr. Leo Kanner of Johns Hopkins University met DonaldTriplett, a five-year-old boy who would be known for decades only as Donald T.,the first child in Kanner’s 1943 article describing a new condition known asautism.43 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_211] The Rockefeller Foundationsupported Kanner’s work. The Triplett family lived in the small lumber town ofForest, Mississippi, where yellow fever outbreaks had occurred.According to his father, Donald always had always been fussy with food and wasnever interested in candy or ice cream. At just one year old, he could hum andsing many tunes, and by the age of two had developed an exceptional memory fornames and faces. As he grew older there was something peculiar about him, anabnormal insularity and aloneness. Donald’s father was a successful, meticulous,and hard-working lawyer who, when ill, always followed, “doctors’ orderspunctiliously, even for the slightest cold.” The boy’s doting mother was calm,capable, and a college graduate.In their book on the autism epidemic, The Age of Autism (2010), authors DanOlmsted and Mark Blaxill uncovered many interesting facts about the families ofthe first eleven children diagnosed with autism.44[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_212] Autism patient number two was FrederickCreighton Wellman III. He was referred on May 27, 1942, at the age of six years.His father, Dr. Frederick L. Wellman, was a plant pathologist who worked intropical areas of the world where yellow fever was common.The father of patient number three was a forestry professor, who worked at theUniversity of North Carolina. North Carolina was one of the states where theBrodie polio vaccine underwent early trials and where Gilliam conducted hisstudy on the vaccine. Again, there is the shadowy presence of vaccines, whichhad been passaged through mice. The father of patient number four was a miningengineer. The fathers of patients five through seven were all psychiatrists andthe mothers of patients five and seven were respectively a nurse and apediatrician.The mother of patient number seven, Dr. Elizabeth Peabody, cocreator of the“Well-Baby” visit (an early wellness concept that caught on through subsequentdecades of post-war hygienic concern), which generally consisted of anexamination of the child and an increasing number of immunizations designed tocurb the infectious diseases of childhood.It stands to reason that Dr. Peabody might have been among the first people thata researcher like Brodie would have contacted to assist in his vaccinationcampaign. In an article about a talk Peabody gave in April of 1947, theAnnapolis Capitol reported:Too many parents, said Dr. Peabody, have the proper shots given and then relax,forgetting that booster shots are needed and that immunization does wear off.Speaking specifically of some of the most prevalent ailments, she stated that achild cannot be vaccinated against smallpox too often and it should be done forthe first time when a baby is between three months and one year of age.45[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_213]The father of patient number eight was a patent examiner and his wife was apsychologist.Both of patient number ten’s parents were in the medical field. His father was apsychiatrist and his mother worked in a pathology lab. Would the offspring ofthese parents have been among the 7,000 children who received the Brodievaccine, which was claimed to offer protection against the scourge of polio? Ofthe twenty known occupations of the parents of Kanner’s first eleven cases, tenwere in scientific or medical pursuits. Four were psychiatrists, two were plantscientists, one was a psychologist, a nurse, a pediatrician, and the last workedin a pathology lab. Three mothers were teachers, and the remaining professionsbroke down into lawyer, mining engineer, patent examiner, clothing merchant,advertising copywriter, magazine employee, and theatrical booking agent.In their book on autism, Olmsted and Blaxill found the evidence pointed to threedistinct clusters among the first eleven autism cases.The first was the mercury fungicide cluster centered at the University ofWisconsin and Frederick Wellman’s work. Wellman’s son was case number two inKanner’s study.In addition to Wellman, this cluster connected with case number three, the sonof William Miller, who was a forestry professor at North Carolina StateUniversity. The school had recently acquired an eighty thousand acre tract ofland known as Hofmann Forest. Ethylmercury fungicides—including Ceresan andLignansan—developed by Wellman and others were being used at North Carolina’sresearch station in the Hoffmann Forest.Of the two compounds, Lignasan, showed the most promise. Besides the studentsand faculty using the research station in the Hoffman Forest, three lumbercompanies also shared the research station. One of the three companies,Eastman-Gardiner, owned land that extended north to that of the territory ofBienville Lumber, headquartered in Forest, Mississpippi. This was the home ofDonald Triplett, patient number one of Kanner’s eleven. Could the mercury fromthese agricultural products or the mercury derivative, thimerosal, used inBrodie’s vaccine which was passaged through mice set off a chain reaction insusceptible children?While there was no direct evidence, Olmsted and Blaxill argued that it seemedlogical to conclude that the smaller mills located in Forest also used Lignisanin the years before the birth of Donald Triplett. Thus, the first three cases inKanner’s group all had links to agriculture and forestry, and specifically tothe Caribbean and southern parts of the United States, as well as to the use ofmercury-containing fungicides. A question can reasonably be extrapolated fromthis knowledge. Might researchers traveling to undeveloped areas of the southernUnited States, or to the Caribbean, fear tropical diseases like yellow fever andhave been among the first to volunteer for the Rockefeller Foundation’s yellowfever vaccine?The 1933 Annual Report for the Rockefeller Foundation, just seven months afterthe first successful human trial, does report just such an approach.Vaccination against yellow fever by the injection of human immune serum andliving yellow fever virus fixed for mice was begun in 1931. The number ofpersons vaccinated in the laboratories of the Rockefeller Foundation has nowreached fifty-six. These persons have been principally members of the staff ofthe Foundation assigned to yellow fever work, and government officials,missionaries, scientists, and educators about to leave for countries in whichyellow fever was present.46 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_214]The second cluster was referred to as the medical cluster, embracing the fieldsof pediatrics, psychiatry, psychology, nursing, and pathology. This groupcontained cases five, six, seven, eight, and ten. Olmsted and Blaxill focused onthe work of Peabody and the effort in the 1930s to vaccinate children with a newdiphtheria toxoid shot containing thimerosal, a mercury derivative. Theyasserted the likelihood that any parent involved in medicine would have been anearly adopter of vaccines to protect their children. Would they also have beenamong the parents volunteering their children for an early Brodie polio vaccine?Could they have been among the 7,000 children who received that vaccine?Blaxill and Olmsted argued that the clustering of some of the early cases ofautism around Baltimore raised questions about whether the Johns Hopkinsanti-diptheria campaign of the early 1930s may have contributed to these firstcases as well. Could the new diphtheria vaccines have also been the product ofmouse-derived biological products? Or might these children have also received aBrodie polio vaccine? Could autism have spread among the members of the medicaland scientific community, as it did in the Los Angeles County General Hospitaloutbreak of ME/CFS. If so, might it have interrupted development only amongthose families whose parents had some acquired pathogen perhaps transmitted totheir offspring, who were also exposed to the mercury-containing products, andwhose children were at a critical stage of development?If one considers the infection rate of 10.7 percent among the Los Angeles nursesin the ME/CFS outbreak (presumably female), and 5.4 percent among the doctors(overwhelmingly male), then it’s easy to see how even widespread exposure amongmedical professionals would not necessarily translate into a perceived outbreakof autism among their children, as the secondary outbreak would have looked likea small trickle by comparison.The third cluster, containing only patients nine and eleven seemed to onlyoverlap in that they resided in major cities, specifically, Boston and New York.These would have been natural places to conduct trials of either the Brodiepolio vaccine, or other early vaccines which were at least partially derivedfrom mouse products. And what of the “thimerosal,” the mercury derivative usedin Brodie’s vaccine?The trifecta of genes, infections, and toxins suggested by the DAN doctors toMikovits did seem to parallel much of the historical information uncovered aboutthe earliest outbreaks of both ME/CFS and autism. While Blaxill and Olmsted werelooking for evidence of thimerosal exposure in agricultural products, there wasanother potential source. Brodie’s experimental polio vaccine was among thefirst to use the mercury preservative.”47 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_215]* * *In looking at the birthdates of the initial eleven autism cases from Kanner’sreport (rather than when they were seen at Johns Hopkins), it is clear that thefirst known child to have autism was born on September 13, 1931. Human testingof the first mouse-monkey-human yellow fever vaccine took place exactly fourmonths earlier, starting on May 13 of 1931. The second child, Elaine C., wasborn on February 3, 1932 in Boston. The third child, Alfred L., had thebirthdate June 20, 1932. The last child in Kanner’s first eleven children,Herbert B., came into the world on November 18, 1937.In a little more than six years, eleven children came down with this previouslyunrecorded mystery affliction and found their way to Johns Hopkins Hospital inBaltimore, Maryland, where they were seen by Dr. Leo Kanner, a RockefellerFoundation Fellow. The parents of two of these children even knew each other. Acountry away in 1934–1935, 198 nurses and doctors at Los Angeles County GeneralHospital had fallen ill with the mystery affliction that made them even sickerthe more they struggled against it, like Charlie Chaplin caught in a giantindustrial cogwheel.The tight chronological association between these outbreaks is unmistakable, asis the occupational connectedness of the victims’ families, who were mostlywell-educated people in the medical or scientific professions. What else mightthese two diseases share?After nearly eight decades, it may be difficult if not impossible to nail downan answer.* * *But someone may have known further information.If Hyde’s claims are accurate, a settlement of six million dollars wasdistributed to the nearly two hundred staff members of the Los Angeles CountyGeneral Hospital in 1939. In the last official year of the Great Depression,when people were still sewing dresses from flour sacks, it seems beyond beliefthat the hospital would pay out an amount that would equal just over a hundredmillion dollars today, simply out of good conscience. It’s plausible the pay-outwas meant to compensate the staff for their injuries without assigning blame.But then if there was no actual or perceived blame, why were the afflicted notsupposed to discuss the epidemic?Wouldn’t that have been the standard scientific investigation for such an event?Perhaps it’s a further stretch, but could the mystery entity have any link tothe parents of the first autism cases? Given what we know today about theability of viruses to recombine, is it possible that experiments at theRockefeller Institute in the 1930s to create a yellow fever vaccine, and inlater attempts by Brodie and others to create a polio vaccine, might haveaccidentally created a mouse-human hybrid virus that caused its own unique setof symptoms?Would scientists today even be allowed to conduct such experiments or were theya sign of more lax attitudes toward protecting human subjects? In the 2006Pulitzer Prize winning book, Polio—An American Story, author David M. Oshinskyrecounts the 1930s race to develop a polio vaccine by Brodie, his mentor WilliamPark (a professor of bacteriology at New York University Medical School), andtheir rival John Kolmber—who was a Philadelphia pathologist supported by a groupof Philadelphia hospitals and medical schools. Oshinsky also addressed thefall-out from this race.After first testing the vaccine successfully on monkeys:Park and Brodie next tested the vaccine on themselves. There were no problemsbeyond some muscle discomfort near the injection site. Then a dozen childrenwere vaccinated, all supposedly “volunteered by their parents” . . . Inoculationof this material into several human volunteers having shown that it was probablysafe for human administration, it was used in children.”“Probably safe?” “Used in children?” These words, so chilling today, were hailedas progress by a public just awakening to the threat of polio.48[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_216]The effort fell apart when several scientists, including those from theRockefeller Institute (who had pioneered the passaging of human tissue throughmouse brains) and those in public health like Gilliam’s boss—James Leake—statedthat not only was the vaccine ineffective, but questioned whether the vaccinemay have conversely triggered the disease in some patients and caused injury ordeath in others.In their discovery of XMRV, Silverman and DeRisi found that the retrovirus wasclosely related to a known mouse retrovirus. But mice and men have shared theplanet for millions of years, so how did the retrovirus suddenly jump to humans?If we believe Gilliam’s opinion that ME/CFS had a pathogenesis around 1934, wemight have an explanation. We know that the Brodie polio vaccine, passagedthrough mouse tissue, was administered to nurses and physicians at Los AngelesCounty Hospital in 1934.Might this explain why only the medical staff of the hospital (and not the morevulnerable patients) came down with this new disease? Just as the scientificcommunity would come to believe that XMRV was derived from prostate tissuepassaged through mice, the question is whether something similar had happeneddecades earlier.* * *What is most curious about the 1934 investigation of the polio outbreak in LosAngeles by the Rockefeller Foundation is their failure to make any mention of itin their 1934 Annual Report.49 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_217] It seems thatan effort to observe a polio outbreak unfolding would have been one of thepremier public health projects of the year, and heralded to donors in the publicrelations materials. Yet there is no mention of it in the 1934 Annual Report.The Rockefeller Foundation was only too happy to report its success againstyellow fever, however:Before the partial perfection of a vaccination method, first applied to humanbeings on May 13, 1931, one of the tragedies of yellow fever work was thecomparatively great danger to laboratory workers and men engaged directly in thefight against yellow fever . . . Fortunately, this danger seems to have beenended by the timely application of a method of vaccination which consists inadministering modified virus accompanied by immune serum . . .50[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_218]Likewise, the Rockefeller Foundation had no difficulty trumpeting their supportof Kanner (who nine years later would publish the first description of autism)as he attempted to develop a program of research and training at Johns HopkinsUniversity School of Medicine:The departments of Psychiatry and Pediatrics of the Johns Hopkins UniversitySchool of Medicine are cooperating in the development of a program of researchand teaching in child psychiatry in the Pediatric Clinic under the direction ofDr. Leo Kanner, a former Rockefeller Foundation fellow.51[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_219]The annual reports of the Rockefeller Foundation also offer a window into thefinancial state of the foundation. Upon closer inspection something curiousappears along with this conspicuous omission: the disappearance of more thanseven million dollars.The Rockefeller Foundation entered the year 1935 with a little more than$153,600,000 in their principal fund.52 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_220] Intoday’s money that is roughly equivalent to 2.5 billion dollars. At the end of1935, they had realized a fifty thousand dollar increase in the principal fundfor a little more than $153,650,000 in that fund.For a foundation with more than a hundred and fifty million dollars inprincipal, this principal increase was an expected amount. The principal throwsoff enough money to fund annual projects and research and if there’s a smallyearly loss or gain it doesn’t make much of a difference to the ongoing work ofthe foundation.But starting in 1936, a different pattern shows up. From the years 1936–1939 thetrustees of the foundation invade principal and transfer $7,800,000 to the“Appropriations Account,” resulting in a decrease in the value of the principalfund to a little over $146,000,000.53 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_221] Wheredid this substantial amount of money go?Could it have gone to the 198 nurses and doctors of the Los Angeles CountyGeneral Hospital with the mystery affliction, a.k.a. ME/CFS? Besides the morethan six million dollars cited by Hyde going to the patients, there would alsohave been administrative and legal fees. The numbers are suggestive, but in noway conclusive.They deserve a deeper explanation.Between 1940 and 1941 the trustees withdrew an additional $1,750,000 but thiswas balanced by the return of $1,700,000 in 1941 and 1942 from a cancelled“contingent project.” When the account was reconciled, from the years 1940 to1945, there was a total loss to the fund of just $50,000.The 50K figure is a far cry from the $7,800,000 withdrawn from principal between1936 and 1939. Why was there no mention of Rockefeller Foundation’sinvestigation into the 1934 Los Angles epidemic where—in addition to polio—theyobserved the first chronic fatigue syndrome epidemic?The team from the Rockefeller Institute were welcomed as heroes by the citizensof Los Angeles. Why then do the exploits of the small, wiry Yale professor Pauland the tall, handsome Webster disappear from the historical records of theirown institution?Paul and Webster have in essence become the “Invisible Men” of science.* * *Nearly eighty years have passed since those events of the 1930s.It may be impossible to recreate the precise chain of events that led to thecreation of the Los Angeles General Hospital ME/CFS outbreak and those firstcases of autism. But that doesn’t mean that we might not be able to make someeducated guesses.In January of 2011, an article was published in the journal Frontiers inMicrobiology that tried to make sense of the evolution of this type ofretrovirus and the possible connection to human disease. The article wasentitled, “Of Mice and Men: On the origin of XMRV.”54[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_222] The authors considered two possiblescenarios. First, that the virus could have spread through direct virustransmission from mouse to human, and second, that it may have come from mousebiological products, specifically vaccines:One of the most widely distributed biological products that frequently involvedmice or mouse tissue, at least up to recent years, are vaccines, especiallyvaccines against viruses . . . It is possible that XMRV particles were presentin virus stocks cultured in mice or mouse cells for vaccine production, and thatthe virus was transferred to the human population by vaccination.55[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach5fn_223]What if like a character in some Greek tragedy who seeks to bring aboutsomething good for humanity, the scientists who sought to end terrible diseaseslike polio and yellow fever inadvertently created other diseases? Could theBrodie vaccine have contained unsuspected new viruses caused by the mixing ofanimal and human tissue? Could other researchers who mixed human and mousetissue in cultures for vaccines and other biological products have created otherentirely new strains of viruses?What if in the attempt to solve the riddles of one plague, the scientists hadcreated two more?"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXDay Three in JailA good head and a good heart are always a formidable combination.—Nelson MandelaSunday, November 20, 2011By Sunday morning’s breakfast call at 5:45 a.m., the rain outside was a steadywhite noise and Mikovits knew she was not getting out that day.1[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach6fn_224] The arrest at home on Friday had blindsidedeveryone as there was no arrest warrant. By Saturday in her jail cell, she feltangry, mystified, and increasingly sad. By Sunday morning, these had muted intoa dull resignation.Mikovits gazed out the small window at the top of her cell. She saw tops of rowsof lemon trees outside, discerned a hazy rim of the mountains in the distance,and watched the sheets of rain coming down. The guard led them out, and aftergrabbing their breakfast trays she and Marie went back to the cell. Mikovitspicked at her food. Marie ate quickly and then dozed off. Mikovits could onlyflash back to recent events.Months after her October 2009 publication in Science, the staff at WPI hadchatted anxiously about how to respond to the increasing controversy over theassociation between XMRV and ME/CFS. Beyond the discovery of HTLV-1/2 and HIV,the field of retrovirology had been a quiet player in human diseaseinvestigations, but those retroviruses—particularly HIV—were scientificbombshells. The press exploded after the Science publication and some officialsseemingly did covert damage control, with Dr. William Reeves from the Centersfor Disease Control’s ME/CFS program proclaiming to the New York Times about herresearch “If we validate it, great. My expectation is that we will not.”2[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach6fn_225]Annette was a fan of the 2009 movie Invictus, which detailed how in hispost-prison years Nelson Mandela had launched a charm offensive, using whiteSouth Africans’ rugby fanaticism as a way to bring factions of the countrytogether after apartheid had ended. With Morgan Freeman as Mandela and MattDamon playing the captain of the South African rugby team during the World Cup,the movie had moved Annette to the point that she had encouraged Judy (whowasn’t a film buff) to recruit the entire staff to watch it.Mikovits saw the movie on a flight shortly after a conversation early in 2010with Annette “We know that groups like the CDC and the NIH have in the pastscrewed up their investigations into this disease, but we want to bring themalong,” Annette had said. “We want them as our partners. If the CDC has a probewe can use, then we take it. If the NIH wants to help, we’ll let them. Let’s tryto make everybody a winner.” It seemed possible to quilt together ideas, as hadbeen done in AIDS, once the initial resistance and prejudice was overcome.In a field where discoveries were often side-tracked by ego grabs, the two womenwanted to show collaborative potential for the common good. Though ME/CFS wasoften dismissively called a “wastebasket diagnosis,” early AIDS might have beensimilarly pegged if it wasn’t bogged down in other insulting misnomers such as“gay related immune deficiency” (GRID), since its initial presentation seemedbeyond belief.The so-called “wastebasket” mislabeling was, in fact, the basis for a lot of theprejudice against ME/CFS patients, leading to the false impression that patientscould not possibly have so many diverse symptoms in one body. As patient-writerJodi Bassett stated in her article “ME—The Shocking Disease,” “People say it’stoo severe and there are too many symptoms. The entirely unique way we respondto even trivial exertion and are so disabled by it, instead of inspiringsympathy, seems to actually inspire disbelief. People seem to (bizarrely)believe that there must be some limit on how bad a disease could be, and thatsuch severe illness couldn’t be possible long-term.”3[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach6fn_226]A retrovirus theory for ME/CFS—as with AIDS—created a unifying thread, since itmade essentially every coinfection hypothesis workable as these could now beviewed as secondary infections. AIDS (as opposed to just HIV infection) was infact defined as HIV plus one of twenty odd coinfections and CD4 counts below200, with the bugs attacking a patient after the immune system was wrecked byHIV.The resemblance of ME/CFS to AIDS was unmistakable: AIDS patients often hadactive coinfections in the herpes virus family, mycoplasma, candida—all found tobe overrunning the body in ME/CFS by doctor-pioneers such as Dr. Martin Lerner,who biopsied heart tissue of ME/CFS patients and found opportunistic infectionssuch as cytomegalovirus (CMV) and HHV-6, as well as Lyme and Babesia.Babesiosis, CMV, and HHV-6 are also known to run rampant in AIDS, and Lyme iscaused by a spirochete just like syphilis, which occurs in AIDS. Lerner’s storywas like that of Chiron, the mythological “wounded healer,” as his eureka momentabout ME/CFS and heart infections came after his own heart was infected and hetreated himself with antiviral drugs.4 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach6fn_227]Other tick-borne coinfections such as bartonella are also found in both AIDS andME/CFS. In AIDS, an association was even found between bartonella henselae andthe progression to neuropsychological symptoms and dementia.5[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach6fn_228] Bartonella in AIDS patients was studiedfairly early on in the pandemic because of the tragic fact that some people withAIDS, seeking comfort in a pet, had contracted it from cat scratches.Immune abnormalities in natural killer cells, RNase L and clonal expansions of Tcells in ME/CFS also paralleled the immune dysregulation recorded in AIDS, andcould be retroviral in origin. Even John Coffin from Tufts University, discussedthe potential new linkage between retroviruses and ME/CFS in his earlycommentary on the Science paper.Coffin temporarily saw they were looking through a sharper lens at old history,and in retrospect the connections between ME/CFS and a retrovirus were obvious.* * *Around eleven-thirty that familiar call came over the cell’s speaker: “Mikovits,prepare for a visitor.” As if to add to the feeling that the jail was some kindof wastebasket—a place for the socially forgotten—nobody else on the cellblockhad had a single visitor but her. She snapped into the routine this time. Shehad the booking number sheet in her pocket and put her hands behind her back,and covered her signet ring with a finger.The door to the cell opened and Mikovits knew to wait at the entrance for theguard now. From where she stood at attention, she could see the circular freetime room and some of the inmates sitting at the steel picnic tables. Althoughthe faces were fuzzy without her glasses, she saw the woman at the table nearestto her take notice of her. “Can you help me?” the woman asked imploringly.Mikovits recognized Ruth, the woman who had entered the holding cell sobbing andcoughing on Friday night. Mikovits surveyed the scene to see if any of theguards were witnessing this. She had noticed that they didn’t seem to mindprisoners communicating, so she chanced it. “What do you need?” she replied.“You have a visitor?” asked Ruth. “You’re going to see someone now?”“Yeah in a minute.”“I have to get word to my family and to my work. They expect me to be there orI’ll be fired. I have to keep my job.”“Your family only has cell phones?” Mikovits asked, remembering how difficult itwas for her to make contact with David from the holding cell initially due tothe restriction from calling cell phones. But the rules were different at theTodd Road Facility, allowing cell phone calls.“Yes. My daughter has a landline phone, but I only got the answering machine.”Mikovits imagined the phone ringing at the daughter’s home, the message machinepicking up, and the robotic voice that David would later parrot saying, “Messagefrom inmate—Ventura County Jail.” Ruth did not seem like a repeat offender—likeMikovits, she looked shocked to be there, a little too pliable for theatmosphere, traumatized. Her daughter probably had no idea her mother had beenpicked up by police.“What do you need me to do?”“I work as a checker at a grocery store in Thousand Oaks. Call and tell themRuth is sick, but she will try to be there tomorrow. I will call them when Ican. I have the bail money. In my purse I have money, but it was taken from me.If somebody can make bail I can pay them right back.”Mikovits knew the woman’s bail was probably only a few hundred dollars. “Whatare the charges against you?”“Driving under the influence. But I wasn’t drinking. I was sick with a cold. Itook NyQuil, but it did not help my coughing and it was keeping my husbandawake. He was angry and cranky because he had to go to work early the nextmorning. He told me to go to the store and get better cough syrup. Cops pickedme up on the way to the store. I shouldn’t be here.”“I’ll do my best,” said Mikovits just before the guard ambled up. Mikovits puther hands behind her back and placed one finger over her signet ring to concealit, and made her way to the visiting room. Ruth was all smiles as she passed,exclaiming, “thank you” as the guard cast them both a curious look.David and Sheralyn Littleton, a dear friend from their church, CommunityPresbyterian (the parishioners call it CPC) in Ventura, sat on the other side ofthe glass.Mikovits grabbed the phone handset hurriedly and David mirrored her on the otherside. He asked if she was okay. She mentioned to him that she hadn’t been ableto brush her teeth since Friday night when they had given her a small packet oftoothpaste. David knew there was a general store for the inmates and had gottenthe paperwork to set up an account for her, but it would not open until Mondaymorning.Another day stretched before her without a way to brush her teeth, but it wasjust another indignity. Any time an inmate complained, the guards reminded herthat jail wasn’t a resort.David looked like he had not slept. The lines on his forehead were littlecrevasses behind his icy-looking skin. He gave the phone over to Sheralyn, whosaid, “Judy, everybody has been praying for you. We can’t believe this!”Sheralyn and her husband Emmet were deacons at CPC. She was part of a group thatvisited hospitals and prayed with people before surgery. Strong in her faith,Sheralyn typically contained her emotions to soothe those patients. When she sawthe surreal image of her friend behind glass, she could see Judy was about tobreak into tears. Sheralyn tried to steer her friend away from emotion, toprotect David who seemed fragile.Sheralyn and Emmett had met David at CPC well before they had ever seen Judy.David would rave about the fabulous woman he had met who lived back East, whileSheralyn teased him that Judy was just an imaginary girlfriend. They finally allconnected at a Superbowl party in 2001 and Sheralyn took an instant liking tothe scientist. The couples traveled together and Judy enthusiasticallyvolunteered for the church’s charitable activities. “I know, Sheralyn. I’m inshock about it too. Please tell everybody I’m okay.”“I will take care of David,” said Sheralyn. “He’s frightened about thesehorrific events, but he has so many caring friends. Don’t you worry.”Sheralyn was having trouble envisioning what improbable set of circumstances hadlanded her friend in jail. Judy was a big-hearted person. David gushed about hercompassion. “I wouldn’t be surprised to come home and find somebody sleeping inour living room,” he joked, soliciting guffaws from those who knew Judy’s openheart meant an open door policy. She and David slept on the sofa, endured thebad backs in the morning, and gave up their own bed for whomever they hadwelcomed in. Sheralyn hated to see her friend like this.Mikovits knew how bedraggled she must look dressed in her orange jumpsuit withher unkempt hair, her breath surely questionable. She was grateful there were acouple inches of thick glass since she wasn’t so minty fresh. David looked to beon the edge of crumbling. “Can I have him for a minute?” she asked her friend.Sheralyn handed David the phone.Sheralyn could only hear one side of the conversation, but it was vintage Judy.“You want me to do what?” David asked.* * *Back in the free-time room, Judy saw Ruth again. “So? Did you talk to him?” sheasked.“Yes, he’s calling your employer.” Mikovits glanced suspiciously around to seeif their conversation was attracting the guard’s attention.“Oh, I am so relieved! Thank you!” exclaimed Ruth. “Were you able to talk to himabout my bail?”“Yes, that too. Let me give you his cell phone number. He now knows yoursituation and maybe can do more.”David and Sheralyn were at a nearby restaurant decompressing from theirexperience when the call from Ruth came in. David thought it was his wife andaccepted the collect call, but quickly figured out it was her jail-mate. Hereassured Ruth that her workplace had seemed sympathetic about her health. Hewas a little bewildered by her request to help her make bail, but knew his wifewould want him to do something. He drove Sheralyn to her house through thestill-pounding rain and then headed over to the courthouse to talk to a bailbondsman.The process took over an hour, and then he needed to wait for Ruth to be drivenover from the Todd Road facility so that he could escort her home. Prisonersalso had to have someone pick them up once bail was posted. Ruth’s car—herfamily’s only car—had been impounded. At about seven in the evening, whileMikovits was in the free time room, she saw Ruth enter the area with her box ofpossessions and her folded-up thin mattress that could have been a Pilates matunder better circumstances. Ruth nodded to Mikovits, mouthing an exaggerated“thanks” as the guard hurried her out.Mikovits thought for a moment about the narrow line between freedom andincarceration, between wellness and a virulent disease. Virologist Robin Weissonce wrote, “If Charles Darwin were alive today, he might be surprised to learnthat humans are descended from viruses as well as from apes.”6[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach6fn_229]On a cellular level, there really was a pretty thin separation between insideand outside, self and other. People were made up of theirinterrelationships—from the cellblock to the world outside, from the virus tothe inner machinery of a human cell. Interrelationships were the essence oflife—both good and bad—and perhaps this is why the simple of act of connectingwith another inmate made the day feel lighter.* * *Mikovits knew what a gentleman David was. He would immediately offer to carryRuth’s box for her, with the kind of simple sweetness that could push a personto tears after an ordeal like jail. He would also be upbeat, make pleasant smalltalk to keep Ruth at ease. He came across as both caring and incrediblynonthreatening to strangers, which had attracted Mikovits when she met him in1999 and he was the human resources director of a local hospital. The differencebetween David and some HR folks is that he really did see all people asresources, much like his wife did.Mikovits had an indulgent moment of self-pity, since this time she wasn’t thelucky one. She had not seen a lawyer, nor even heard from one. She had talked tothe astonished bail bondsman who proclaimed that in all of his years he had notseen a bail hold for somebody in her situation. She wondered if she should callDavid tonight, but at ten dollars a minute, what would she say other than tellhim how distraught she was. In her helplessness, she felt perturbed. Why hadn’the been able to bail her out?As her thoughts churned, Mikovits heard a woman’s voice singing a religiousmelody loudly in the background, with erratic pitch. She recognized the song as“Praise God.”Mikovits glanced up saw the wiry inmate with a mop and bucket and spray bottlesworking on the shower. Her tune seemed so happy, defying the surroundings. Shedidn’t mind at all if she skipped half the words, humming through verses. Shekept time by slopping the mop on the tile, circling it around, wringing it out,singing her mop-microphone karaoke. Mikovits felt spurred to do something.She walked over and asked, “Do you want some help?” Her jail mate was in herearly thirties, thin with cropped dark hair, looking like somebody who mighthave thrilled down highways on a Harley or two. Mikovits later learned the womanwas in jail for stealing a truck, a story that like many of the stories sheheard in jail contained a few murky particulars.“Sure,” said the woman jovially, and handed Mikovits some of her cleaning items.“Just follow me.” The woman returned to scrubbing out the shower and resumed hersinging while Mikovits began wiping down the sink.“Where did you get these supplies anyway?” Mikovits asked.“Oh, you just ask the guards and they’ll give them to you. You don’t think theguards clean up, do you? They leave that to us.” Mikovits hadn’t even consideredthis.They scrubbed for a few more minutes and Mikovits marveled at her newacquaintance’s beautiful work. “You’re a pro at this,” she said.The woman let out a hearty laugh and said, “Well, I should be! I do it for aliving!” “Ah, that’s great. My place is a mess.” Mikovits flashed to imagine herransacked home. “Maybe when you get out of here I can hire you.” The woman gaveher a wily little smile, as if aware of the absurdity of their situation andsaid, “Sure, I’m always looking for work.”Again, Mikovits hoped the movement would help her sleep. Earlier in the day shethought walking quickly up and down the stairs between the two levels would tireher out. But actual work was something different. It got into the bones in adeeper way.They were nearly finished with the second level when Mikovits on a whim decidedto take a minute to watch the football game on television. She loved watchingsports, from basketball at the UVa to the minor league Reno Aces baseball team.Mikovits had even been Annette’s special guest at game five of the 2010 WorldSeries when the San Francisco Giants won the series for the first time inhistory. In the picture they emailed to Frank Ruscetti, they looked as thehappiest of sisters; who would have guessed that one year later Judy would bejailed by her sister. Harvey, a lifelong Giants fan, often ribbed Mikovits thathe had given up his seats to her and had never gotten to see his beloved team atthe World Series because he was too busy fighting foes for Annette and Judy.But she wasn’t in the bleachers at PacBell Park now, just straining by thesecond-level railing at the Todd Road Facility to see the game on the small TV.She leaned out over the atrium to make out the scoreboard.“Suicide!” A shrieking call came over the loudspeakers. Mikovits peered aroundat the sudden, sped-up motion, heard the thud thud thud of the guards’ hurriedfootsteps, the crisp steel door from the tower swinging open. Her initialthought was that someone had been found blue in a cell, and guards were rushingin to perform CPR. In another split second, she realized they were lookingsquarely at her.“Stand back from the rail!” warned the guard who was now just about ten feetaway from her, warily holding hands out in a protective stance and angling in aslight squat toward her.Her cleaning partner intervened, “Oh honey, don’t you know you can’t standthere?” Just beyond the rail it was open air and a ten-foot drop to the firstlevel of the free room. The guard looked at the other inmate, searching forvalidation that Mikovits wasn’t going to make a suicide attempt.“I’m sorry,” mumbled Mikovits. “I just wanted to see the score and my eyesightisn’t so great so I was just leaning—” She quickly stopped blathering and backedaway from the edge.Then the guard immediately relaxed her posture. The free time area, focused onthe drama for a minute, went back to buzzing with conversation.Mikovits went over to her jail-mate and picked up the cleaning supplies, shaken.What a crazy day for a scientist, from the early rooster call to being viewed asan imminent suicide risk.Like jails, viruses themselves were also freedom-snatchers, basically inertuntil they invaded a host cell and then doled out rules, parameters, andbehaviors for the host to follow. As much as free will actually mattered,viruses seemed to hijack it on a cellular level. As Michael Specter wrote in theNew Yorker, “Viruses reproduce rapidly and often with violent results, yet theyare so rudimentary that many scientists don’t even consider them to be alive. Avirus is nothing more than a few strands of genetic material wrapped in apackage of protein—a parasite, unable to function on its own.”7[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach6fn_230]It was easy to imagine how, given this zombie-like depiction, those with ME/CFScould feel like the living dead. Viruses toppled the inner workings of life andchanged the very structure of identity, much like the jail cell was alreadygiving Mikovits a different and harrowing vision of what was possible in herlife."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENThe Submission to ScienceAt the heart of science is an essential balance between two seeminglycontradictory attitudes—an openness to new ideas, no matter how bizarre orcounterintuitive they may be, and the most skeptical scrutiny of all ideas, oldand new. This is how deep truths are winnowed from deep nonsense.—Carl SaganAfter the Cleveland Clinic, the National Cancer Institute, and the WhittemorePeterson Institute signed the confidentiality and collaborative researchagreement on Saturday, January 24, 2009—to isolate the XMRV retrovirus fromhumans for the very first time and demonstrate its association with ME/CFSMikovits quickly jotted off an email to her lab technician, Katy Hagen.1[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach7fn_231]When the word contamination later became such a hot button issue—the e-mail wasan important record of Mikovits’s thought process, as she briefed Katy on how toproperly decontaminate the lab for upcoming experiments. All of the signatoriesunderstood the momentousness of what they were embarking on. They were on thehunt to isolate a new human retrovirus of unknown pathogenic potential. Theimplications could be even further-reaching than the AIDS epidemic. If theysucceeded, their findings might create a revolution in thinking about the roleretroviruses play in human health.Most virology research dollars were spent hunting visible “killer viruses,” suchas Ebola, West Nile Virus, and Bird Flu. But what if such conspicuous targetswere only part of the story? Scientists had been focused for over a century onviruses that brought obvious mayhem and death to society, but what about virusesthat might be incapacitates, silently stealing the health of victims? As MichaelSpecter wrote in The New Yorker:Nothing—not even the Plague—has posed a more persistent threat to humanity thanviral diseases: yellow fever, measles, and smallpox have been causing epidemicsfor thousands of years . . . Those viruses were highly infectious, yet theirimpact was limited by their ferocity: a virus may destroy an entire culture, butif we die it dies, too . . . Only retroviruses, which reverse the usual flow ofgenetic code from DNA to RNA, are capable of that.2[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach7fn_232]If a retrovirus could lower the defenses of the immune system, ushering in ahost of pathogens that in turn caused complex damage, the Invasion of the BodySnatchers scenario became overwhelming.ME/CFS patients sometimes called themselves the “living dead.” Though otherdiseases had caused freakish disruptions of sleep (i.e. African SleepingSickness, Fatal Familial Insomnia), there were few conditions that matched thetwilight reality of ME/CFS that could linger for decades. Yes, patients remainedalive, but barely. Mikovits kept thinking of Dr. Mark Loveless’s statement thatan ME/CFS patient feels every day about the same as an AIDS patient feels twomonths before death, or Dr. Nancy Klimas’s declaration that her AIDS patientswere “hale and hearty” compared to her ME/CFS patients. “Many of my CFSpatients, on the other hand, are terribly ill and unable to work or participatein the care of their families,” Klimas wrote in a New York Times blog.3[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach7fn_233]Mikovits and her team now had a propulsive plan. Once they had meticulously donetheir research, they would submit their article to the most prestigiousscientific journal in the world, Science. Then the evidence would cross into theglobal sphere for other scientists to grab the baton. With a clearer grasp ofpathophysiology, they could finally work on therapeutics for the disease. Butthey had to be exacting. From the beginning they must eliminate every possiblesource of contamination. She had learned from Frank Ruscetti and her work withHTLV-1 and HIV-1, when isolating a new human retrovirus and attempting toassociate it with a disease, contamination was the foremost threat. She keptthis as her highest priority. In her email to Katy Hagen, Mikovits detailed whatshe had learned to be the possible sources of contamination, after more than twodecades of work with human retroviruses.4 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach7fn_234]She told Katy to wipe down everything in the lab with bleach, change HEPAfilters, empty all incubators of cultured cells, also no cultures in thelaboratory but primary patient culture and autoclave the glassware, instruments,and where possible, reagents. An autoclave sterilizes lab equipment inhigh-pressure saturated steam at temperatures above 400 degrees Fahrenheit forabout 15–20 minutes. Katy methodically went through the decontaminationprocedures, and then carefully taped the email from Mikovits into her notebookon January 25, 2009. These were standard procedures when working withretroviruses, but of course HIV had spawned a whole generation ofever-increasing caution. When Mikovits returned a few days later, she pulled outofficial HIV decontamination protocols and made sure those were carefullyfollowed in the lab as well.Since the WPI building was still under construction, they had been working intemporary lab space, room 401 of the Applied Research Facility at the Universityof Nevada, Reno. Keeping the research confined to a single laboratory lessenedthe possibility of contamination. Mikovits flashed back to her first sciencejob, when she was a protein chemist at the National Cancer Institute’sfermentation program, and how in her opinion there had been lax safetyprocedures during the first growth of HTLV retrovirus in large-scale fermentersthat were something like the steel tanks in today’s microbreweries.The questions about XMRV were the same as they had been about HTLV in the earlyfermentation lab, and much more important two years later as they isolated HIVin Ruscetti’s lab. How infectious was the virus? How stable was it? Nobody knewthe answers with XMRV, so it was crucial to proceed as cautiously as possible.They also had to determine what other parties should sign the confidentialityagreement5 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach7fn_235] and participate so the researchcould go forward, but keep the team limited to a minimal number due to theproject’s riskiness. Mikovits added Katy Hagen and Max Pfost, as signatories.Frank Ruscetti added two of his research associates. At Bob Silverman’s lab, Jaydip Das Gupta was added, because he would do the genetic sequencing of thevirus.Mikovits then contacted Debbie, a nurse who had worked at Peterson’s office.Besides being a nurse, Debbie was a skilled phlebotomist. Mikovits assignedDebbie to draw blood, consent people into studies, coordinate patients, and keepclinical data in order. Because the WPI had yet to be awarded its first NIHgrant, Debbie could only be salaried as a part-time employee and Mikovits waslimited in assistants to students and a single postdoc, Lombardi.One of Debbie’s first duties was to draw the blood of everybody at the lab tosee if they had been exposed to, or infected by, XMRV. This blood work wouldestablish a baseline for the lab workers and allow protection of the staff fromunknown risks. If any of them already carried the retrovirus it could compromisethe integrity of the research, and they would have to be dismissed since theworkers themselves could bring contamination. A consequence of this confidentialstudy was that relatively few people could be even aware of its existence. Thegraduate students running experiments in Room 401 were also a concern. If theywere not directly involved in Project X (as it came to be known), they still hadto be protected from exposure because of the shared facilities. Mikovits had toencourage them finish up their projects, move them to another lab, or simplyshut them down and shuffle them out without offering an explanation. She knewthat being brusque and secretive about Project X was likely to generate hardfeelings, especially as it would be out of character for her.6[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach7fn_236] But those were the options.For many reasons she decided that the lab in Applied Research Facility (ARF)Room 401 would only be used for work with patient blood samples and that novirus would be grown there. Lombardi would grow the virus in a separate lab atViral Immune Pathology (VIP Dx), a distinct company purchased as RNASEL EnzymeDeficiency Lab (RED) LABS from Dr. Kenny de Meirleir in 2004 by the Whittemoresin order to bring to market any diagnostic tests or therapeutic treatments thatmight be developed for ME/CFS.Even though the WPI still didn’t have its own laboratories, they would pourcopious resources into the XMRV project. The project was not even on Mikovits’soriginal list presented to her scientific advisory board just a few monthsearlier. The risks were incredibly high, the atmosphere necessarily covert. ButSilverman and Ruscetti thought the preliminary data was so compelling and thebenefits for the patients so potentially dramatic that they just had to go allin.In a town of cheap slot machines and occasional windfalls, Mikovits and her teamwere ready to roll the dice.* * *Mikovits was routinely up at five a.m., clutching a cup of coffee, and on thephone with Frank Ruscetti who had returned to the NCI in Frederick, Maryland.They laid out plans for the critical experiments they needed to perform,determined who would do what, figured out what samples from the repository wereimportant, and strategized how to move the daunting tasks forward. Mikovitsspent substantial time writing up the plans with Katy Hagen, who had risentoward the top of the pack of research associates/students. Katy was focused andthorough, and Mikovits saw a vision of herself as a young researcher whenRuscetti had noticed her potential.Although it was not one of the four methods they would eventually use to testfor the presence of the virus, Mikovits knew it was important to show that XMRVhad a natural history of infection in humans by isolating virus from patientsand passing it into other cells.Previously all of the work on XMRV biology had been done using an infectiousmolecular clone, which was constructed from partial XMRV sequences from RNAisolated from tissues from prostate cancer patients. One way to obtain thisevidence was an electron micrograph picture of XMRV, preferably an image of theparticle budding from a cell. This could be compelling evidence the virus wasactually replicating and infecting other cells.To isolate XMRV from a single human then use it to infect white blood cellsrepeatedly would prove that XMRV was the first member of the third knowninfectious human retrovirus family. Electron micrograph pictures had provedsolid evidence with other retroviruses: Poiesz and Ruscetti presented one withthe isolation of HTLV-1, and Montagnier obtained an electron micrograph image ofthe HIV retrovirus that became a central piece of evidence in convincing thescientific community that HIV was a human infection. Montagnier brandished theelectron micrograph picture to doubters and decriers. The image was prettyindisputable, a vivid depiction of something previously unknown to science.However, there was no electron microscope available for use in the vast butsparsely-populated state of Nevada.Most science students across the world have peered into a regular lightmicroscope and seen cells, so they have an appreciation for the small size of atypical cell. They can learn to identify the cell wall, the protoplasm, maybeeven the nucleus. But a virus is typically about a million times smaller thanthe cells they infect, so without much more magnified imaging the virus isguesswork, almost phantasmal, to students trying to comprehend it. The viruscontains a relatively small amount of genetic information, leading to thequestion posted in the last chapter: is a virus is a living thing or more like aparasitic entity? Some who argue a virus lives say that the ability to reproduceis the hallmark of a living thing. Others claim viruses are not alive since theylack reproductive machinery and must hijack cells to propagate.Modern virus hunting rarely includes electron microscopy, but relies primarilyon molecular genetic sequence data. But to Mikovits, the appeal of an electronmicrograph picture of the suspected virus was undeniable. A traditionalexpression in science states “extraordinary claims require extraordinaryevidence.” Having a vivid picture for people to see, rather than just a drysequence of numbers on a page, would go a long way.Mikovits was fortunate enough to have a friend back at the NCI who ran the NCI’selectron microscopy facility. He was the scientist who took the electronmicrographs that proved the retrovirus Gallo claimed as his HIV retrovirus hadactually been taken from Luc Montagnier’s samples. The WPI would have to pay forthe work to be done, but the Whittemores could make it happen. It would take agreat deal of work on the part of Mikovits and Hagen to get samples ready forelectron microscopy, but Mikovits felt it was of critical importance.The work was done in a biosafety level three lab at UNR, and Mikovits preparedto teach Hagen the procedure to get the samples ready. Cells needed to becultured and then pelleted by high speed centrifugation, first separating virusin the supernatant from cells and cellular debris. Finally, the viral particlecontaining supernatant had to be concentrated at very high speedultracentrifugation and the virus pellet stabilized.A virus is actually composed of two parts, an outer protein shell called acapsid and an inner core, which is composed of either DNA or RNA. A virus lookslike an M&M candy, with a hard outer candy shell and a chocolate or peanutinterior. Enveloped virus had a lipid containing membrane called a viralenvelope. The outer layer of the virus can have a different arrangement of viraland cellular proteins (which it gets while budding from the cell), which bind tocell surface receptors that allow it to enter into various cells.These viral protein molecules have also been found to provoke many of the body’simmune responses. Some researchers have speculated that many autoimmune diseasesare the result of the body reacting to the envelope proteins (the “hard candyshell”) of certain viruses, rather than an infectious process (much of the laterdebate about XMRV would revolve around this point). But with the M&M analogy,the chocolate, peanut, (or even more recently, pretzel) interior of a virus hascaused the greatest amount of debate. In what scientists consider a“replication-competent” virus, there would be a shell and an inner core with acomplete genetic sequence.But defective viruses have only a protein shell and a partial genetic sequenceinside and need helper viruses to spread. The scientific community has typicallyresponded that if a virus does not contain a complete interior genetic sequence,it should not be considered a dangerous microorganism: it’s like a Tin Manwithout a heart or a Scarecrow without a brain.Others, including Dr. Sandra Ruscetti (the head of the Retroviral PathogenesisSection of the NCI),7 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach7fn_237] have advocated for along time that science needs to take a closer look at the disease-causingpotential of the protein shells of these viruses. Sandra Ruscetti had publishedextensively on the spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV), a replication-defectiveretrovirus that nonetheless becomes very pathogenic in susceptible strains ofmice.8 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach7fn_238] What Mikovits learned from SandraRuscetti was later invaluable in the investigation of XMRV.For the time being, when Mikovits and Hagen were finally able to obtain a pelletfrom the ultracentrifugation, it was composed of almost pure virions. Once thework was completed, the samples traveled to her friend at the NCI, who producedsix electron micrograph pictures. Even looking like colorful but unearthlycreatures, the images were as clear as anything that Montagnier had shown morethan a quarter of a century earlier in the HIV investigation.The evidence was becoming even stronger that they were on the trail of a newhuman retrovirus.* * *This was a critical first step. Now they had to move forward to show the viruswas infectious and transmissible.This could be the first member of the third family of human infectiousretroviruses. Mikovits was simply looking for some evidence of the XMRVretrovirus in patient blood samples. Gag is the name given to one of the threemajor proteins that are encoded within the genome of a retrovirus. Eachretrovirus has a specific gag sequence, almost like a fingerprint, so once aresearcher has identified the gag sequence, she should have a pretty good ideaof the identity of the retrovirus.Since all retroviruses require the machinery of a cell to replicate, they liedormant in cells until a signal is received that allow them to replicate to adetectable level. Transmitting the virus from the patient’s white blood cells orplasma into the LNCaP cell line (an immortalized line derived from a lymph nodemetastasis from a sixty-two-year-old prostate cancer patient) appeared to makethe virus replicate like crazy. Mikovits knew that LNCaP was responsive tohormones and cytokines (inflammatory molecules), and in fact, turned out to bethe single best cell line in which to grow gamma-retroviruses. Importantly, ithad never been cultured with mouse cells lines or passed through mouse tissues.It was a stroke of good luck, allowing them to biologically amplify low levelsof virus from a small number of white blood cells or a minimal amount of plasmaso that it could be detected. She could use this indicator cell line with thosesamples they had painstakingly prepared for more than two years from Peterson’spatients and those with abnormal immune responses.Another necessary step was to show which immune cells harbored the newgamma-retrovirus. Were they T cells and monocytes—was the case in HTLV or HIV—orwere there different reservoirs of infection? Could the retrovirus betransmitted “cell free” (by virus floating free in plasma) like HIV, or didtransmission require cell to cell contact (with the virus contained withincells, like HTLV-1)? They were all key questions that a paper on the firstisolation of a new human retrovirus should answer to be fully credible.A key proof that the XMRV isolated from the patient samples was not due tocontamination involved looking for the presence of antibodies to XMRV in theblood of patients. In most viral infections this was a simple andstraightforward way of looking for evidence of past or current viral activity.But the question remained whether this was a reasonable way to search forevidence of a virus that had not previously been isolated from humans. In thefirst publication for the isolation of HTLV and HIV, this had been consideredbeyond the scope of the first paper.Mikovits and her team focused instead on proving XMRV isolates from humans withME/CFS were infectious and transmissible. They also attempted to confirmSilverman’s finding showing that XMRV infections were limited to individualswith a specific genetic polymorphism in the RNASEL gene—that of R462Q—a singlenucleotide change that essentially rendered the antiviral enzyme inactive.Many of the most deadly viruses, such as Ebola, seemed to cause the greatestdamage in those individuals whose systems did not mount an antibody response.9[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach7fn_239] The immune system was like a sickly guarddog, sleeping through the invasion. It was reasonable to think the most severelyinfected patients with the virus would show no antibodies at all to the virus.That was why they were sick, as they could not fight it off.By contrast, the healthiest of the ME/CFS patients or those with some degree ofrecovery would show the highest antibody response. Focusing on whether theisolates from XMRV-infected individuals were infectious and transmissible were“old school,” time-consuming methods of finding a virus, but Mikovits preferredthem. Some of the more technologically advanced methods, like the viral arraychip technologies, suffered limitations, such as the failure to load the propersequence into the chip.If the technology wasn’t right, the answers wouldn’t be either. Garbage in,garbage out, as the computer programmers liked to say.An additional safeguard was to keep the various parts of the study separate sothat nobody could later question whether there had been inadvertentcontamination. Pfost was doing his part of the work at a lab in the agriculturebuilding, a place that had never grown human or mouse cultures. Hagen wasworking at the biosafety 3 lab. Lombardi was working at the private VIP Dx lab,which was about ten miles away from the University of Nevada, Reno campus, andpatient material was all confined to the Mikovits research lab, located at theApplied Research Facility, Room 401.Among their small group of junior researchers, Lombardi, the former stockbrokerwho had only a year earlier received his doctorate in protein chemistry, wouldtake a leading position. Mikovits assigned Lombardi to work on the immunologicalaspects of the paper, mainly whether the RNase L enzyme deficiency, the naturalkiller cell markers, or any other immune indicators were correlated with XMRVinfection.* * *While Mikovits and her team of young researchers were working on their secretproject, Mikovits also had other important tasks at hand.The International Association of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (IACFS) was meetingfrom March 12–15, 2009 in Reno and the WPI was gearing up to host it at thePeppermill Resort, which had recently finished its four hundred million dollarrenovation.10 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach7fn_240] Mikovits and her teamsubmitted four papers for presentation at the meeting.The Seeno family, part-owners of the Peppermill, rolled out the red carpet forscientists not accustomed to the casino lifestyle. Those attending theconference got reduced room rates (some with jaw-dropping views of thesnow-capped Sierra Nevada mountains and the city lights of Reno), access to tenof Reno’s finest restaurants right there at the Peppermill, and a space to relaxat the Spa Toscano, a full-service salon where one could relax with a Swedish ordeep tissue massage.The program promised the “Latest Advances in Virology, Genetics, Pediatrics,Brain Functioning, Epidemiology, Treatment, and Assessment” and Mikovits focusedon welcoming the speakers and hosting the conference. For their keynote speaker,they had Dr. John Kitzhaber, the former two-term governor of Oregon, whose wifesuffered from ME/CFS.11 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach7fn_241] There werepresentations on behavioral assessment of ME/CFS patients, alternative medicaltreatments, use of interferon, active HHV-6, HHV-7, Epstein-Barr virus,cytomegalovirus, and even an association between ME/CFS and mitochondrialdysfunction.Of the four talks being presented by Mikovits and her team, two gave her pause:one that she was scheduled to give, “Identification of Differentially ExpressedViruses in American CFS Patients with a Custom Mammalian Virus Microarray,” andone by her postdoctoral fellow, Lombardi, entitled, “Serum Cytokine andChemokine Profiles of Individuals with ME/CFS Distinguish Unique Subgroups AmongPatient Populations.” There were many sharp minds at the conference.One attendee was Dr. Maureen Hanson of Cornell University, who had been studyingME/CFS ever since her close relative had come down with it.12[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach7fn_242] As Hanson later recalled, “At the meetingshe [Mikovits] talked about using a microarray for viruses in chronic fatiguesyndrome and I had been thinking of doing the very same experiment myself. So Iwas glad to see that somebody else had already done it and people were trying tofind out if viruses were present.”13 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach7fn_243]Mikovits was afraid that if anybody was really paying attention to the two talksfrom her group, they might sleuth out that someone was on the trail of aretrovirus. The talks could blow their cover, but they were only ten minuteslong. So, Mikovits was careful with the data shown in the slides so theywouldn’t scream out “retrovirus!” to somebody who really knew the science.But the conference did not expose them. Mikovits was pleased the talk shepresented on behalf of her NCI colleague and the talk by colleague and UNRepidemiologist—Julie Smith-Gagen—were noted in Harvard professor Komaroff’ssummary as among the most intriguing at the conference. There were some rumorsbuzzing around the conference of a new virus isolation, but the research teamwas tight-lipped, and their data was preliminary. If attendees later felt theyhad been misled by the attenuated talks, well, the information would break witha bang in a couple months.The data was just too sensitive to be prematurely released.* * *As the team moved ahead, however, there were a few tiny fissures in the unity ofthe project.When Mikovits had returned from the earlier San Diego conference and discussedthe suspicions of a retrovirus with the Whittemores, they all agreed to bringPeterson in on the research. He would be integral to choosing the patients mostlikely to harbor the virus, and Mikovits was concerned that they might beconstrained if they were unable to obtain fresh patient blood.The Whittemores asked Peterson to sign the confidentiality agreement.14[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach7fn_244] He asked what it was about, but theWhittemores said they would tell him after he signed it. He wanted his lawyer totake a look. This reasonable volley back and forth somehow began thedeterioration of the relationship with Peterson, but the reasons were neverclear to Mikovits.15 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach7fn_245]Mostly, the process was efficient and congenial, as well as exciting. EveryWednesday there was a meeting at the luxurious offices at the Red Hawk resortwith Annette, Harvey, Mikovits, Peterson, and Mike Hillerby, who was one of thebosses at the Wingfield Nevada Holding Company. They discussed what was notcovered by the confidentiality agreement, and only that, carefully avoiding anymention of the details of their secret project, the one named “Project X” intheir computer folders now.Harvey would often take Peterson aside and tell him that the confidentialityagreement needed to be signed, because he had an important matter to discuss.But even the “king of the legislature” could not get through to the doctor whohad landed at ground zero of the modern epidemic of ME/CFS.Nobody knew why.* * *Silverman also threw a wrench into the works.In early April of 2009, Mikovits contacted Silverman and asked, “Okay, you saidyou’ve done this in hundreds of samples. Can you provide the peripheral bloodmononuclear cells, the blood data, for those where you found XMRV negative foreverybody except those with the R462Q variation?”The R462Q variation was the genetic aberration that Silverman credited withcausing the crippling defect in the RNase L antiviral defense enzyme. Mikovitswanted those data from blood, rather than tissue, since they were using bloodsamples from the ME/CFS patients and XMRV had never been isolated from theprostate cancer patients tissue or blood. They were trying to determine if theR462Q variation correlated to evidence of XMRV in blood, and thus to the RNase Ldefect, and needed to make this comparison using blood instead of tissue.Silverman replied, “Oh, we never looked in blood.”16[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach7fn_246]The control samples he had done were of prostate tissue for people who eitherdidn’t have prostate cancer but had resections for things like benignhyperplasia, or from other tissue surrounding the diseased area, and thus tissuesamples were what was available.This revelation injected an unanticipated degree of uncertainty into the XMRVinvestigation. It was clear that Silverman could identify the XMRV virus intissue.But it might be another thing entirely to locate the virus in blood.This was in part due to the problem of viral latency, the ability of a virus tohide in certain organs and not be detectable in the bloodstream. This was adilemma that kept virologists awake at night. Does a negative viral test basedon a blood sample really mean the patient is negative?Could the virus be latent and inactivated in organs and tissue, in the DNA, astheorized by Cheney? Could a relatively low amount of viral activity causesymptoms in the patient but not otherwise leave traces in the blood? If thevirus was in some way modulating the immune response to insure its survival, itbecame much more complex, stealth, and puzzling.So Mikovits, just about a month out from submitting the paper, suddenly had herback against the wall. While Mikovits and Ruscetti had looked at the blood ofhealthy people, the non-contact controls for viral expression, they had neverlooked at the much higher number of samples needed to be examined for a geneticmutation like RNASEL R462Q. She had to find more healthy blood donors sinceSilverman could not offer blood samples.Fortunately, the cytokine paper the Mikovits team had started in 2007 yielded anunexpected bonus. In preparation for the study, they had acquired a number ofnormal blood samples. The samples had been collected by a UNR researcher and aphysician in Reno in the course of a study to examine normal immune responses inwomen. It was Mikovits’s good fortune that the samples had been perfectlyprepared for her intended use. The samples contained both plasma and DNA and alot of flow cytometry data, which would allow them to look at populations ofnatural killer cells and differences in lymphocyte populations. All they had todo was take the DNA and plasma for XMRV PCR and serology and do cocultures withLNCaP and RNASEL genetic studies.Other controls were also tested blindly in Frank Ruscetti’s lab at the NationalCancer Institute. He was also able to get fresh controls through the NationalInstitutes of Health, who were always collecting samples as part of theirongoing mission of protecting public health. In addition to the samples from thecytokine study, the WPI was able to purchase a hundred frozen samples from apaternity testing lab in Nevada. The paternity samples offered an advantage inthat they were age and sex matched according to geographical locations, whichcould be identified by their zip codes.One of the concerns in terms of backlash was that people might make the mistakenassumption that the control samples were from those who might have been linkedto the Lake Tahoe outbreak of 1984–1985. The mix of samples from around theUnited States with a concentration in Nevada, as well as the controls FrankRuscetti was receiving through the NIH, should make it clear the team waslooking at the prevalence of the virus in the general population. They combinedthe results from controls for the Nevada group, which was about four percentpositive for XMRV, and the results from Frank Ruscetti’s group at the NCI, whichwere close to 3.5 percent. The control group eventually included three hundredand twenty subjects who had no history of ME/CFS.Twelve of the controls were positive for the XMRV retrovirus, an infection rateof 3.75 percent. If those numbers could be extrapolated to the US population itmeant that somewhere between ten to twelve million Americans were infected withthe virus. Twelve million people would equal close to the total 2012 populationsof New York City (8.337 million) and Los Angeles (3.858 million) combined,obviously a devastating number.The comparison of ME/CFS fatigue to an atom bomb suddenly seemed eerily apt, andnot just because of how the patients felt. It was as if a sneak attack had beenlaunched against the American public, and even now they didn’t see the smokingwreckage.Before they could finish up their manuscript and send it off, one event tookprecedence over all other things: a soiree that every member of the WPI wasexpected to attend, the Andrea Whittemore wedding.* * *Andrea Whittemore and Brian Goad said their vows on April 25, 2009 in Reno.17[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach7fn_247] It was a quintessentially lavish Whittemoreaffair, displaying the wealth, political influence, and familial closeness thatled Mikovits to later dub them the “Kennedys of Nevada.” The wedding was slatedfor eleven o’clock at the historic Trinity Episcopal Church on the banks of theTruckee River that twisted through downtown Reno.Frank and Sandy Ruscetti flew out for the wedding and the Whittemores put themup at their luxury twelfth floor condominium at the Palladio, a swanky downtowndevelopment. The unit had Western views, which took in not only the sunset overthe Carson Range whose peaks reached more than five thousand feet into the sky,but a section of the Truckee River and the city of Reno. Mikovits’s condominiumwas just a block away. The Ruscettis were also there to work on the finalsections of the paper with Mikovits. Sandy Ruscetti’s expertise in mouseretroviruses and the protein envelope were of critical importance.* * *The wedding was on a dazzling, sun-dappled April day typical for Reno: pleasantand bright but not too hot. The wedding party included many members of the largeWhittemore family. The church’s old-fashioned pipe organ added to the grandnessof the space, and once Mikovits showed up with her group, there were at leasttwo hundred people seated. She and David slid into a pew with Frank and SandyRuscetti, as well as Katy Hagen and her parents. Katy’s father was Judge DavidHagen and her mother Peggy was one of Annette Whittemore’s best friends. Theservice, traditionally Episcopalian, reminded Mikovits of her girlhoodCatholicism, and she was delighted to see Andrea—the woman who lost much of hergirlhood to a ravaging disease—have this opportunity.The wedding ended at just past noon, but the reception wasn’t scheduled untilsix, giving Andrea time to recuperate a little before her next public showing.Along with David, Frank and Sandy, and Katy and her parents, their group headedover to the Silver Peak for some lunch and drinks. When the meal was over, Judyand David went with Frank and Sandy to the Whittemore condominium at thePalladio and spent a few hours chatting about the remaining issues in the paper.The reception at the Peppermill Casino gathered together all the usual politicaldignitaries. But the highlight of Andrea’s wedding reception was without a doubtthe father-daughter dance. Pictures of Andrea’s porcelain skin and slightlyforced smile with a nasal oxygen cannula were later featured in the New YorkTimes, but for now, the dance floor cleared to a lighted silence, and then bigHarvey took the floor with his pale, delicate daughter, and they floated aroundto the music.* * *Unbeknownst to Mikovits, and probably most of the guests, beneath the surface ofthe celebration were broiling issues that threatened to destroy the Whittemoreempire and the accomplishments of the WPI.In a lawsuit filed on January 27, 2012, by their business partners in theWingfield Nevada Group Holding Company, the Seenos alleged that prior toAndrea’s wedding, Harvey had illegally obtained a forty-four million dollar loanand spent it all in fifteen month’s time.18 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach7fn_248]According to the lawsuit, Harvey had also made a confession.“As admitted in his confession, Whittemore lied to the Seenos when herepresented to them that he would use his personal funds toward capitalcontributions to Wingfield. To the contrary, Whittemore admitted in hisconfession that he used bank proceeds for lifestyle choices and to make otherinvestments . . .”19 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach7fn_249]It also alleged that Harvey did not even have enough money to pay for hisdaughter’s wedding. He put the wedding expenses on the Seeno and Wingfield“tab,”“One such event was his daughter’s wedding, which included five-star food andwine tastings, bridal showers and a rehearsal dinner leading up to the wedding.These events included the purchase of tuxedo uniforms for Red Hawk wait-staff,special china dinnerware named after his daughter, special custom lighting,exterior and interior alterations to Red Hawk premises and many other purchaseditems and extraordinary costs and expenses which, except for a meager $10,000paid by Whittemore, were all paid for by Wingfield at Whittemore’s direction.20[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach7fn_250]Wingfield’s expense for the affair totaled approximately $200,000 which wascharged to Wingfield without the Seenos’ knowledge, approval or consent.”Harvey was already legendary in Nevada as “king of the legislature,” a “PowerRanger,” and a close confidante of the Senate Majority Leader of the UnitedStates Senate. But according to the Seeno lawsuit, in 2009, he barely had tenthousand dollars to contribute to his daughter’s wedding.Mikovits, her team at the WPI, and her collaborators at the NCI and theCleveland Clinic, had no idea that the vaunted Whittemore real estate empire waslooking more and more like a house of cards.* * *On the afternoon of May 6, 2009, Mikovits emailed the Science article showing anassociation between the XMRV retrovirus and patients with CFS, along with theaccompanying figures.April and early May of 2009 were consumed with the furious writing and revisionof the paper. The article went through a dozen revisions, with Silverman,Mikovits, Ruscetti, and the coauthors all rewriting various parts until it wasfinally in impeccable shape. To celebrate the victorious completion of theedits, Mikovits took her small team out for dinner.Mikovits couldn’t help but notice how weary everybody looked. They had workedfeverishly over the past four months, and though their faces might not show it,they had reason to be deeply proud. Science was supposed to respond withinthirty days of the submission, so for the first few days Mikovits tried to blockthoughts of the paper out of her mind.In the review process, the journal would likely request additional items. Evenif they didn’t, there were still aspects of the project to complete. She wouldtake a breather, relax a bit, and then plunge back into the work that had beenput on hold after the meeting of the International Association for ChronicFatigue Syndrome the past March.The Invest in ME meeting was at the end of May. It was one of Mikovits’sfavorites and she had to prepare her talk on immunology and the viralmicroarray. She was so hopeful that she might have an answer from Science by themeeting that her last slide was an electron micrograph of XMRV.At the conference, Hillary Johnson delivered an electrifying speech called “TheWhy,” about the systemic ostracizing of ME/CFS patients, stating,“Hate speech incites acts of discrimination against the victims of such speech.Think of all that is denied M.E. patients as a result of being characterized asmalingerers, attention-seekers, neurotic and emotionally weak, or as David Bellsays, ‘Nutballs and fruitcakes’? How did the Soviet Union discredit itsdissidents? It called them mentally ill. Labeling M.E. a psychiatric disorder isa political act, a form of social violence.”21[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach7fn_251]It seemed to underscore the timeliness of Mikovits’s research that wouldhopefully end tactics to discredit the sufferers. She was so moved by Johnson’sspeech that she called Frank Ruscetti at a late hour and begged him to let herreveal the secret of the retrovirus. He reminded her how important it was tohave the paper published first.Mikovits remembered the January day six months earlier when she and Lombardi hadshowed the preliminary data to Silverman and Ruscetti, and Silverman hadexclaimed, “This will change everything for the patients.”On the way back to Reno, she stopped in Frederick, Maryland, to visit family andwork on the ongoing collaborations with Frank Ruscetti and her former NationalCancer Institute colleagues. They anticipated one of the questions a reviewermight ask was: “If your original hypothesis was based on the RNASEL, R462Q SNPcorrelation in the prostate cancer patients and the RNASEL deficiency in ME/CFSpatients, did you find the R462Q SNP correlation of the RNASEL gene in ME/CFSpatients?”They wanted to prepare for this essential question. Mikovits was concernedbecause the work had seemed beyond the reach of the WPI’s limited resources. Sheknew the experts in these types of genetic analyses were Drs. Michael Dean andBert Gold at the NCI, so she invited them into the project.Curiously, their team did not find an association between the RNASEL geneticvariation and patients with ME/CFS.It was still true per earlier research that the RNase L anti-viral defenseenzyme was working poorly in patients with ME/CFS. But they didn’t know whichgenetic variation was causing it or whether the faulty enzyme might be caused bysomething else altogether.As frustrating as this development was, these little hiccups commonly happenedin research. The finding was unexpected, and something of a black eye for BobSilverman whose original hypothesis now appeared in jeopardy. What appeared tobe true one day might be disproven the next.But that was the nature of science.* * *On Thursday, June 4, 2009, the editor of Science sent out the journal’s reviewof the paper. Mikovits was in Frank Ruscetti’s office when the email arrived andthe two of them quickly raced through it. The journal was “intrigued” by thefindings but had a number of reservations about the work. There were concernsabout the possibility of contamination, the genetic background of the patients,whether the virus might be a cofactor, and whether the finding might be a PCRfalse-positive.22 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach7fn_252]Mikovits and Ruscetti read through the comments of the referees, and perhapsbecause they felt too close to the original work, they sent a copy of thecomments to a colleague and WPI advisor.The colleague was much more optimistic than Mikovits and Ruscetti had been aboutthe comments. “You’re in!” he wrote back enthusiastically, noting the objectionswere easily answerable and the additional research could be completed in afairly brief period of time. The key was showing an immune response, which wouldeliminate the possibility of contamination.Mikovits dove back into the research, adding a former student and brilliantyoung scientist who could develop the phylogenetic tree of XMRV. Thephylogenetic tree would show the evolutionary relationship between XMRV and itsclosest viral cousins. Science asked for the immune response and Silverman wouldsay, “I hope you can find one [an immune response], because Abbott [Labs]cannot.” Ruscetti would confirm this statement when he attended theretrovirology conference in Brazil over the Fourth of July holiday and saidAbbott had not been able to find an antibody in more than 1,000 blood samples.By July 12, 2009, Mikovits felt the manuscript was ready to be resubmitted. Inthe letter she wrote:23 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach7fn_253]All of the referee’s concerns have been addressed with new data. As a result, wefeel our new data strengthens the conclusions that the novel human retrovirus,XMRV is present in most patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).We show that XMRV detected in humans is not a lab contaminant by: (1) providinga phylogenetic tree relating all human and mouse XMRV and XMRV sequences asrequested by reviewer #1 (supplemental fig 2) showing that XMRV strainsidentified in this study and in the original report on XMRV cluster as a groupseparate from XMRV; (2) demonstrating the presence of circulating antibody toXMRV Env protein [the envelope or protein shell of the virus] plasma asrequested by Advisor A (figure 4C and S5) . . .Also, as requested by all the referees, we have now provided data on the RNaseLgenotype for the R462Q variant that had originally been associated withsusceptibility to XMRV in prostate cancer. In CFS we found no correlationbetween XMRV infection and the R462Q variant. As reviewer #1 pointed out, thisresult makes it more likely the general population is at risk for infection . ..What would they say? Would they accept it or ask for further revisions?Imagining they were in a fairly private dialogue with Science, nobody in theteam could have predicted the bombshell that came next."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHTThe Invitation-Only July 22 MeetingOh my God! You mean all those sequences we saw in the 1980s were real?—Dr. John Coffin1 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_254]On June 12, 2009, Dr. Stuart Le Grice, Head of the Center for Excellence inHIV/AIDS & Cancer Virology at the National Cancer Institute, and Dr. JohnCoffin, Special Advisor to the Office of the Director, also at the NationalCancer Institute sent a letter to a very select group of researchers. The letterread in part:In 2006, XMRV, a human retrovirus closely related to murine leukemia virus, wasidentified and associated with enhanced susceptibility to prostate cancer.Although the public health impact of this was not immediately clear, a series ofpresentations at the most recent Cold Spring Harbor meeting on Retrovirusesprovided additional support for this linkage, and also suggested that the numberof individuals infected with XMRV is significant enough to be a cause for publicconcern.The CCR is convening a small group of intramural and extramural scientists andclinicians with interests in this area to draft a current status report andsuggest next steps for NCI leadership. This meeting will take stock of how theCCR, as a leading retrovirology center, might coordinate efforts to address thispotential emerging health issue.2 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_255]This letter from two of the leading scientists at the Center for Cancer Researchdivision of the NCI, nearly four months before the publication of their articlein the October 8, 2009 issue of Science clearly shows that many researchersbesides Mikovits were extremely concerned about the public health threat posedby this retrovirus.Additional XMRV research had been presented at the Cold Spring Harbor meeting onretroviruses, but many other researchers had presented as well. A team led byDr. Ila Singh of the University of Utah presented an abstract on the prevalenceand distribution on XMRV in human prostate cancers.3[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_256] They noted “We found 23 percent of the 233prostate cancers to stain positive for XMRV.” In conclusion they reported, “Thepresence of virus in malignant cells invokes classical pathways for retroviralpathogenesis, i.e. inactivation of a tumor suppressor or activation of anoncogene by retroviral integration, as possible mechanisms of tumorigenesis.”4[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_257]In plain language, the retrovirus was likely leading to cancer by eitherinactivating a gene which prevents cancer, or activating a gene which promotescancer. These methods of inducing cancer were well known to the retrovirologistsassembled at the Cold Spring Harbor Meeting.Researchers from Japan looked at XMRV infection in both healthy patients andthose with prostate cancer.5 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_258] They wrote,“Although our study has a limited sample size, the prevalence among blood donorsas determined by identifying XMRV specific antibodies was found to be 1.7percent, while that among prostate cancer patients was found to be 6.3 percent .. . The results of genomic PCR performing on the PBMCs indicate that XMRV issituated in a few fractions of blood cells and can spread through blood eventhough the virus replication appears to be very low.”6[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_259]Any later assertions that the concerns over XMRV were generated solely as aresult of Mikovits’s research must be rejected as a false narrative.The question, which would trouble Mikovits in the years that followed is why somany researchers, reporters, and journals were not interested in telling thisvery important truth.* * *The special meeting to discuss the threat posed by XMRV was held on July 22,2009 at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, MD. As described in theintroduction to the confidential summary of the meeting:In 2006, the human retrovirus XMRV (xenotropic murine leukemia virus-relatedvirus) was identified and reported to be associated with certain cases ofprostate cancer. Although the public health implications of this finding werenot immediately clear, a series of presentations at the most recent Cold SpringHarbor Laboratory meeting on Retroviruses provided additional support for thislinkage and suggested that the number of individuals infected with XMRV issignificant enough to be a cause for public concern. In view of thesedevelopments, it was deemed appropriate for NCI to convene a small group ofintramural and extramural scientists and clinicians with expertise in this areato provide the NCI leadership with recommendations on future directions.7[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_260]Even before Mikovits’s data had completed the peer review process, thesewell-connected scientists were discussing and working on XMRV. That theorganizers even included Mikovits and her research in the proposed gathering wasan ironic twist of the normal investigative protocol of science.The general public, less well connected scientists, as well as long-sufferingpatients with ME/CFS were blinded from results until publication, but thescientists could apparently talk about them to their hearts’ content. Mikovitssuspected the “anonymous” referees hadn’t refrained from the chatter either. Itis well known amongst scientists that peer review is anything but confidentialand that experts discuss key papers prior to publication.From the style of the comments, Mikovits and the authors had carefullyconsidered whether any of their three anonymous referees were in the room. Shesuspected at least one of them was Coffin but later she learned this hunch wasincorrect, though any number of his colleagues could have alerted him to thepaper’s existence.Coffin also co-organized this the hastily convened workshop, a fact that stoodout to Mikovits as she reviewed the roster. She’d never met Coffin before butknew him by reputation. In addition to his position at Tufts University, Coffinheld a curious title, “Special Advisor to Director,” for the HIV drug resistanceprogram at the NCI.8 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_261] In 1995 Coffin had beenhired by an inter-personal agreement (IPA) from Tufts University to run the HIVdrug resistance program. An IPA is only supposed to last for three years, butCoffin stayed on for ten years. This was against regulation, so they created anew title for him.Mikovits had a mental image of Coffin and most of his contemporaries from FrankRuscetti’s stories of attending meetings with him in the late 1970s, when Coffinand many other experts had advised Ruscetti not to pursue research on humanretroviruses, stating human retroviruses don’t exist.Ruscetti recalled, “There was a prejudice, and still is a prejudice todayagainst a retroviral etiology in human disease, even though a couple have beenfound. They think those are the outliers. They think animals are different thanman. The basis is that they think the human immune system is much more effectivein taking care of viruses. In the last 30 years, including HIV and HTLV-1, therehave been 109 new human disease-causing pathogens identified. And 65 of them areanimal viruses. What does that tell you?”9 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_262]Mikovits hoped the decades-long passage of time and the ravages of the AIDSepidemic, which provided him with tens of millions of dollars of researchfunding had since mellowed the man.* * *Twenty-two scientists attended the workshop, according to the summary, includingmany luminaries in the field.The meeting included representatives from the HIV Drug Resistance Program,Columbia University, Tufts University, the Cleveland Clinic, the Fred HutchinsonCancer Research Center, the University of Utah, the Laboratory of CellularOncology (NCI), the Medical Oncology Branch (NCI), the Laboratory of TumorImmunology and Biology (NCI), the Urologic Oncology Branch (NCI), the Divisionof Cancer Epidemiology & Genetics (NCI), the Laboratory of ExperimentalImmunology (NCI), the Laboratory of Cancer Prevention (NCI), the AIDS and CancerVirus Program (Science Applications International Corporation—a Fortune 500company with approximately 40,000 employees worldwide), the Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).10[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_263]Mikovits later recalled feeling she had made her presentation beforerepresentatives of most public health hierarchy of the United States government.* * *The confidential account of the meeting listed Dr. Coffin’s presentation first.It was summarized in science-speak that belied the explosive nature of hiswords:Dr. Coffin discussed the properties of XMRV and its relationship to xenotropicmurine leukemia virus (XMLV). He pointed out that different XMRV isolates arevery closely related to, yet distinct from, endogenous proviruses found in thesequenced genome of an inbred mouse.These observations alleviate concerns of laboratory contamination with virus orDNA from laboratory mice but are consistent with very recent, perhaps ongoing,transmission from a wild-mouse reservoir into the human population. However, itis also possible that another animal species has been the vector for zoonoticinfection.11 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_264]In lay terms, a couple of powerful and prescient points stand out. First, XMRVhas a very close association to a known murine leukemia virus. The stretches ofgenetic code that were sequenced from XMRV were closely related to thepreviously characterized murine leukemia virus, but different enough to supportits identification as a newly-discovered virus that could not arise artificiallyfrom laboratory contamination, but likely had a zoonotic transmission.In other words, Coffin asserted that the virus probably leapt the speciesbarrier from animal to human, or in this case, “from mice to men” in the kind ofvirulent largesse that presents a substantial public health threat. Coffinstated the data was “consistent with very recent, perhaps ongoing transmissionfrom a wild-mouse reservoir into the human population.” Each word underscoredthe possibility of a widespread, devastating outbreak.The differences between this new virus and the previously known mouse leukemiavirus, was enough in Coffin’s view to, “alleviate concerns of laboratorycontamination with virus or DNA from laboratory mice.” When Ruscetti heardCoffin say this, he leaned over to Mikovits and whispered, “It does not have togo directly from mouse to man, there could be an intermediate animal such as acow or a goat.”At least at this initial meeting, some of the highest officials in the UnitedStates public health hierarchy had cogently concluded that contamination couldnot explain the XMRV results.What set of events had transpired which allowed this apparently recentcross-species jump from a mouse reservoir into the human population? It waspossible that the mouse retrovirus had jumped first into another species, priorto entering into humans, the way a Lyme disease-causing spirochete jumps fromfield mice nymph deer ticks and ultimately to a mammalian recipient.Alternatively, the transmission could have happened in the course of laboratoryinvestigation, in other words from a scientist directly acquiring the virus froma laboratory animal in a quotidian moment that went unnoticed. It had notoccurred to any of the scientists at the meeting that this virus could haveoccurred by direct laboratory transmission without any natural history inexternal animals. This would have been the first in the history ofretrovirology. No scientist is ever held responsible for exotic biology thatgoes beyond anything that has ever been observed. As Mikovits said in a laterDiscover article, “How could anyone have known?”So much was unknown in this area. Only further research could prevent untolddamage if the virus was indeed wreaking havoc on the human population. Anotherarea of concern was that some species of wild mice “have very large numbers ofrelated endogenous proviruses and that recombinant viruses with long terminalrepeat sequences (LTR) very similar to XMRV are capable of insertionalactivation of proto-oncogenes in animal models of lymphoma, consistent with apotential for oncogenesis by this mechanism.”In plain English this meant that the part of these viruses, which promote theproduction of viral particles when integrated in the host could promote theabnormal production of host genes leading to cancer. As Mikovits saw it, cancerwas the end of the line for the damage that this retrovirus caused in people.But for the millions who suffered from ME/CFS it was not the only damage thatthis retrovirus could cause.* * *Ila Singh, a slender, soft-spoken Indian woman from the University of Utah,dropped a few more bombshells. Her findings were almost as shocking at those ofMikovits.Singh had spent several years working with Ian Lipkin and had done apostdoctoral fellowship with Dr. Stephen Goff, both at Columbia University.As recounted in the confidential summary of the meeting:Dr. Singh presented immunohistochemical and PCR data on XMRV infection. Sheobserved XMRV expression in malignant prostate epithelial cells . . . Dr. Singhexamined a total of 334 human prostate samples and determined that 27 percent ofprostate cancers were XMRV positive. Her finding that 6 percent of thenonmalignant controls were also positive has implications for the generalpopulation . . .. . . Dr. Singh also found that the presence of XMRV in patients was independentof the RNASEL mutation. Other issues addressed by Dr. Singh included (i) whetherwomen are susceptible to infection with XMRV, (ii) whether XMRV is present intissues other than prostate, and (iii) whether XMRV itself would be an earlypredictor of prostate cancer.12 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_265]Singh’s work confirmed many of the things Mikovits had found in her own researchas well as some things that she had suspected but had been unable to prove.Singh also casually released some real surprises that should have struckeverybody in the room with the power of a thunderbolt.The discovery that 27 percent of the prostate cancer samples Singh had examinedwere positive for XMRV was simply devastating. Her sample size of 334 humanprostate samples was large enough to give some confidence that it was a validfinding. One in six men eventually develop prostate cancer over the course of alifetime and better than one in four of those men with prostate cancer showedevidence of XMRV infection.Singh’s work suggested XMRV appeared to be a factor in the development ofprostate cancer, and in the severity of the tumor. In other words, even if XMRVproved not to be a causal factor in prostate cancer, Singh’s research suggestedit could accelerate the disease, creating a grimmer prognosis.Another startling finding was that 6 percent of the non-malignant prostatetissue controls were positive for XMRV. If 6 percent of the men in the UnitedStates were infected with this retrovirus it was a staggering number.Mikovits thought again of the similarity to HTLV-1 in Asia and how it infectedmany individuals but only 5 percent of those infected would go onto developleukemia or the associated neurological disease, HAM/TSP. The problems thisretrovirus caused wouldn’t show up in a pattern like HIV, striking down entireswaths of the population with visible symptomatology if left untreated, but itwould be more diffuse, harder to recognize, and thus harder to attack.Given a healthy immune response and no other complicating factors, it seemedthis retrovirus could live in many men for years and even decades withoutcausing any noticeable problems. But as the men aged, and the functions of theirimmune system started to break down, the retrovirus might begin the chain ofevents that led to prostate cancer. This virus could be a sleeping monster andthe question that would probably need to be asked at some point was: what causedit to wake up and go on a rampage.As Science Now reported on Silverman’s work in 2012, “Silverman’s work on XMRVhad started much earlier, around 2004. His group suspected that a virus might beinvolved in some cases of prostate cancer because men with mutations in the genefor RNASEL, which is involved in innate immunity, have a higher risk for thedisease.”13 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_266] If early treatment or lifestylechanges could prevent progression, wouldn’t some men like to know?As Singh and Mikovits had both found “the presence of XMRV in patients wasindependent of the RNASEL, R462Q mutation.” Silverman’s finding of XMRVinfection only in men with the R462Q RNASEL mutation seemed to be a mistake. Itwould not be his only false step in the investigation. As Dr. Singh discussedlater in the meeting, one could not use a microtome (a tool used to cutextremely thin slices of material called sections) to process tissues that hadever been used with mice or contamination might result.It was not until years later that Mikovits learned of the possibility that themicrotome used in the original study may have been contaminated. However, thefinding of defects in the RNase L anti-viral enzyme pathway was still a viablehypothesis. It’s just that they didn’t know why the antiviral pathway was notfunctioning to destroy the invading XMRV.When Singh was finishing her presentation she noted that one of the questionsthat remained was whether women were susceptible to this infection.Frank Ruscetti kicked Mikovits under the table. “Why don’t you raise your handand tell her?” he whispered.Mikovits leaned over to Frank. “I’m not giving away my punch line,” she replied,with a grin.Singh ended her talk by noting that the other two questions which remained werewhether or not XMRV was present in other tissues besides prostate, and whetheror not XMRV on its own could be used as an early predictor of prostate cancer.After Singh’s talk, Mikovits felt the excitement in the room increasedramatically. Scientists were talking spiritedly with each other, praisingSingh, and it was difficult not to feel that science was on the verge of animportant discovery.* * *Then Dr. A. Dusty Miller, a scientist from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer ResearchCenter in Seattle, Washington, threw a bait and switch to a still-rapt, butmomentarily quieted audience. “Dusty” as he preferred to be called by hiscolleagues, was a slender man with an easy-going smile, but strong determinationwhen he believed in something.He presented two critical XMRV findings.The first substantiated a theory that the XMRV retrovirus could infect all typesof cells, and the second, more controversially in the eyes of Mikovits,supported the idea that XMRV might not be something to worry about at all. Theseideas seemed almost diametrically opposed enough to cancel each other out.The confidential summary of the meeting detailed his findings this way:Dr. Miller discussed host range and receptor use of an XMRV strain isolated from22Rv1 cell line, which was established many years ago. 22Rv1 cells were derivedfrom a patient with Gleason grade 9 prostate cancer in 1991, following multiplepassages through nude mice, suggesting that XMRV has been present in humanssince at least 1991 . . .. . . Preliminary data from the Miller lab suggest that XMRV has transformingpotential in cell culture. However, unlike the oncogenic mink cell focus-formingretroviruses, his data suggest that XMRV cannot multiply reinfect cells inculture, causing cytopathicity [cell death].14[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_267]One of the most critical findings was the discovery of an XMRV strain derivedfrom prostate cancer tissue which had undergone “multiple passages through nudemice,” a common type of laboratory animal.This statement of the natural history of XMRV could certainly account for ME/CFSbeing seen in the 1980s. But then Miller would later illogically claim thatsince the modern ME/CFS was written into the medical literature before 1991, theretrovirus could have nothing to do with the disease. This was as odd as anarcheologist stating that his carbon data from a single site marked the genesisof an entire civilization, without digging any further. The genesis of a diseasecould not be pinpointed from such a small amount of data.Miller also later claimed that the findings of XMRV by Mikovits and others wasthe result of contamination by the 22Rv1 cell line, disputing Coffin’s earlierimplication that contamination was not possible.Mikovits would later show that the 22Rv1 cell line had never been in her lab andthat there was no evidence that the cell line had ever even been in the wholestate of Nevada. But Miller would increasingly dig in his heels over time andclaim that, for a number of reasons, the 1991 genesis of XMRV was the onlyreasonable possibility.Miller felt the discovery of an XMRV strain in the 22Rv1 cell line was a uniqueevent, something that could not have happened prior to that date, and he wasinsistent on his theory. Retrovirologists later came down on his proposed“Immaculate Recombination,” defined as an event that could happen at only oneplace, at one time, in all of evolutionary history, but it was surely a boldstatement on XMRV’s origins.His evidence led Mikovits to another, perhaps more alarming conclusion.If XMRV had inadvertently been created once in a lab, it could happen again andcould have happened before.The process might be “immaculate” in the sense that it arose in a seeminglysterile environment, but that did not mean the recombination had a one-time,one-place origin. Recombination could, instead, be an event caused bysynergistic factors that were common in unrelated labs, at different times.Thus maybe this recombination or one closely related to it had taken place anumber of times in the past, whenever mouse and human biological materials hadshared the same test tube, petri dish, or even when they had simply shared thesame lab.* * *In July 2011, scientists published evidence that XMRV could spread through alaboratory by aerosolizing it, an even more alarming event. Drs. Yu-An Zhang,Maitra Anirban, and Adi Gazdar, et al of the University of Texas, Southwestern,published a paper in the journal Cancer Biology and Therapy in which theyinvestigated the presence of XMRV-related retroviruses in human cell lines whichhad been established from mouse xenografts.15[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_268] (Xenografts are the transplantation oftissue from one species into another for purposes of research. Human cancercells are often xenografted into mice because the cancer cells grow soabundantly in the mouse tissue.)Gazdar was well-known for his investigations into Simian Virus #40 (SV40), amonkey virus which had contaminated both the Salk and Sabin polio vaccine andhad produced evidence of carcinogenity. Prior to working at the University ofTexas, Gazdar headed the Tumor Cell Biology Section of the NCI. The medicalestablishment had in fact ultimately concluded that the Salk and Sabin poliovaccines were contaminated with SV#40 (a result of the growing of the virus inmonkey kidney cells), but they also concluded (erroneously, according to Gazdar)the virus did not pose a threat to human health.Gazdar simply did not share in that view of SV#40’s harmlessness. (An excellentaccount of the entire SV#40 controversy can be found in the book The Virus andthe Vaccine by Debbie Bookchin and Jim Schumacher.16[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_269]) He and his team examined tissues from“xenograft tumor cell lines from seven independent laboratories and 128non-xenografted tumor cell lines.”17 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_270] Thecell lines were tested for mouse DNA and came up negative.What they found would confirm the fear that the passage of human tissue throughmouse biological materials presented the danger of creating a recombinantretrovirus, but would also raise the specter of a completely unexpected threat.Gazadar and Zhang reported:Six of 23 (26 percent) mouse DNA free xenograft cultures were strongly positivefor MLV [murine leukemia virus, the same family as XMRV] and their sequences hadgreater than 99 percent homology to known MLV strains. Four of five supernatantfluids from these viral positive cultures were strongly positive for RT (reversetranscriptase) activity. Three of these supernatant fluids were studied toconfirm the infectivity of the released virions for other human culture cells.18[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_271]This meant that a little more than a quarter of the xenograft cultures showedevidence that they had picked up a murine leukemia virus during its passagethrough the mice. This was confirmed by both reverse transcriptase activity (theenzyme an RNA or retrovirus releases in order to transform its RNA into DNA soit can take over the machinery of a cell) as well as the ability to infect otherhuman cells.This was truly a Frankenstein scenario.The ability to infect other human cells was an important demonstration of thedanger of these viruses to the human population. A certain portion of healthadvocates claim that natural and internally-occurring, or endogenous, humanretroviruses, if stimulated by chemicals in the environment, could be the truecause of many contemporary illnesses. This argument certainly raises animportant discussion—that is, do ubiquitous chemicals in daily life “switch on”internal “passenger” retroviruses to make them suddenly steer the body towarddisease?But if a pathogen shows the ability to infect other human cells it demonstratesthat the virus has not become “endogenized,” because it is now “acting out”instead of merely “acting in” on its host. A virus that has become endogenouswill instead integrate itself into the human genome and then it normally losesthe ability to infect, so its damage is not endlessly disseminating. Somevirologists view loss of the ability to infect other cells as the price thevirus pays for living in symbiosis with its host. It assimilates into thestructure and function of the body, becoming a visceral occupant rather than anenemy faction. Some researchers claim that these endogenous viral genes may makeup as much as 12 percent of the human genetic code, so they are common.19[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_272]But if this virus had not become endogenized, it meant it had probably made thejump to humans within recent history. For those who understood the potentialdangers of viruses and the promiscuous manner in which they could evolve andrecombine with other pathogens to create even more virulent strains, the nextfinding by Gazdar and Zhang was the stuff of apocalyptic nightmares. “Of the 78non-xenograft derived cell lines maintained in the xenograft culture-containingfacilities, 13 (17 percent) were positive for MLV, including XMRV, a virusstrain first identified in human tissues.” 20[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_273]These were not cell lines that had been passaged through mouse tissue.These were cell lines that had simply been in the same laboratory as cell lineswhich had been passaged through mouse tissues.Among the plausible explanations for this alarming occurrence: these virusescould become airborne. In other words, the virus created in the lab could escapeby simply floating away.* * *Those who lived through the terror of the early days of the AIDS epidemic wellremembered the fears of many people who watched dramatic symptoms leading towasting and death ravage whole communities. Many assumed the HIV retroviruscould be spread by casual contact, such as a kiss, the holding of hands, a hug,or even a sneeze. Political and cultural hysteria soon followed as peopledivided themselves into opposing groups with a panicky scramble for safety,often blaming and condemning those who were ill. But the fears had beenunwarranted. AIDS had fallen prey to a long tradition of mystifying modes oftransmission before pathogen theory showed that cultural hand-washing of humanresponsibility should not supplant actual sterile practice. Rubbery latex glovesand condoms ironically made flexible thinking possible again.However, now scientists worried that XMRV might be the realization of thatnightmare scenario that many feared with AIDS, where just sharing a closed airspace with an infected person could put one in serious danger. This horrifyingimage so worried the Department of Health and Human Services, that its directorof health of blood supply, made an urgent phone call to Frank Ruscetti and said,“Our number one priority is to determine if XMRV is a health risk.”The last finding of the Gazdar and Zhang paper provided strong evidence thatXMRV might have the capability to become airborne, rather than contaminate cellcultures in some other manner. They wrote, “By contrast, all 50 culturesmaintained in a xenograft culture-free facility were negative for viralsequence.”If the cultures were kept in facilities without mouse xenograft cell cultures,the risk of contamination appeared to be essentially zero. In their concludingremarks, the Gazdar and Zhang team wrote,XMRV, originally identified in human tissues, is a retrovirus closely related orderived from XMLV [xenotropic mouse leukemia virus] and believed to derive fromthe recombination of PreXMRV-1 and PreXMRV-2 proviruses in mice. These findingsclearly demonstrated that xenograft cell lines, currently widely used asexperimental models, can potentially acquire XMLV including XMRV after mousexenografting.21 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_274]And how did XMRV infect these cultures? Was the virus simply wafting out of itsmouse xenograft cultures to infect other cell lines? Or were the lab workersthemselves being infected with the retrovirus and then spreading it? No onecould say.When Mikovits read the Gazdar and Zhang paper in July of 2011 she couldn’t helpbut remember the fears she’d had as a young technician in the fermentation lababout the potential for infectious spread amongst her fellow lab workers as theyperformed the job of purifying HTLV-1, the first identified human retrovirusfrom the seminal study of Poiesz and Ruscetti, from hundreds of liters of tissueculture. It was what made the unsuspenseful meticulousness of a lab palpablyrisky, especially when lab workers handled an unknown pathogen.The data Miller presented at the July 22, 2009 meeting had some bearing on thequestion of how infectious this retrovirus was likely to be. The confidentialsummary recounted that “The wide XMRV host range was demonstrated by its abilityto infect human fibrosarcoma cells, rat fibroblasts, canine kidney epithelialcells, and mink lung epithelial cells.”22 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_275]In other words, XMRV favored many species, making it difficult to reign in.XMRV had in fact demonstrated the ability to become airborne and infect tissuesin four different species, especially epithelial cells which are usually locatedon the inside lining of blood vessels, where the virus could be released intothe blood.XMRV was shaping up to be a very dangerous virus.* * *Mikovits was slated as the last speaker before the roundtable discussion. Theconfidential summary’s account of her talk eclipsed the others in length as themost scientifically sound presentation, giving an unspoken clue to its centristrole in the hastily-convened meeting. It warranted the longest summary to theofficials who had realized it contained complete data on XMRV in humans:Dr. Mikovits presented data from a Nevada cohort linking XMRV infection withchronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and, potentially, lymphoma in 300 CFS casesidentified from 1984–1987. RNA, DNA, plasma, and frozen PBMC were collected from(about) 100 of these patients between 9/06 and 7/07. Of these, 68 CFS patientswere positive for XMRV. Equally important was that 3.75% of local controls wereXMRV positive.As with Dr. Singh’s work, these results have implications for the generalpublic. If these numbers are reproduced in a larger survey, they would suggestthat as many as 10,000,000 Americans are infected with XMRV. Similar resultswere generated from a Florida/Carolina cohort of CFS patients, i.e., 60%positive for XMRV gag from fresh PBMC. XMRV was also detected in saliva samplesand plasma transmission was demonstrated from >80% of CFS patients’ plasma.In these studies, there was no correlation with XMRV infection and RNSELmutations.. . . Finally, Dr. Mikovits, with NCI coauthors Francis and Sandra Ruscetti andCleveland Clinic coauthor Robert Silverman, indicated that a manuscript showingXMRV enrichment in individuals with CFS was under review; however, experimentsinvestigating a link to lymphoma were still under investigation and wereprovided in preliminary form to alert NCI leadership, given the potential publichealth implications.23 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_276]The confidential summary gave a good account of her presentation. Mikovitsexpected the research to generate controversy and understood there might be apitched battle that would last for years, as it had with HIV and AIDS, but this?The research was supposed to neatly transit to Science, receive anonymousreviews from referees whose job was to parse out scientific concerns, and thenif she carefully and methodically assuaged their objections, the article wouldbe published. After that point, the research would enter the scientificmarketplace of ideas in which others would either confirm or disprove thefindings.This was something else entirely.This was a glass-walled confessional where not just the scientific content, buther very ideas were seen as something to scrutinize or perhaps tame, beforedispersal to the general public. The scene felt like one of those sciencefiction movies where harried government authorities in a hollowed-mountainbunker try to come up with a plan of counterattack for some expected alieninvasion before alerting the public to the threat.Mikovits couldn’t decide whether the government effort made her feel better orworse. Were they more worried about the danger of XMRV or the potential publicstampede (or others in science stampeding onward) if the danger became known?She felt ethically mandated to defend her research, and if possible, shorten thetime the patients afflicted with ME/CFS and other diseases had to wait foreffective treatments.Too many patients slogged through stalled lives already.* * *In the brief time between the July 13 resubmission to Science and the July 22meeting, Mikovits worked extensively on the slides for her presentation.She began by defining Me/CFS, using the CDC’s own criteria, (Fukuda, 1994) whichincluded:“persistent or relapsing fatigue of 6 months or longer in duration,” other knownmedical conditions excluded by clinical diagnosis, and at least four symptomsfrom a list of eight, including impaired memory or concentration, sore throat,tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes, muscle pain, multi-joint pain, newheadaches, unrefreshing sleep, and post-extertional malaise lasting more than 24hours.”24 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_277]Mikovits defined the cohort as being from a cluster of 300 cases of ME/CFS,which had been identified from Incline Village, Nevada from 1984 to 1987.The summer-long effort of her young team to collect RNA, DNA, plasma, and frozenperipheral blood mononuclear cells from about a hundred individuals in bothSeptember of 2006 and July of 2007 was completed. RNA, DNA, and plasma had beencollected from 320 normal regional controls between 2004 to 2008 by hercolleagues at UNR. Mikovits was especially proud of one of their most tellinginnovations, the inflammatory cytokine/chemokine signature.Using this information, Mikovits was able to augment her presentation, andsuggest that CFS was “a multi-system disorder manifested by inflammatorysequalae including: antiviral enzyme RNase L dysfunction, low natural killer(NK) cell numbers and function, and innate immune activation.”25[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_278] On an overhead projector she then displayedher PCR gels of XMRV gag and envelope proteins. She flipped to anothercompelling slide of the phylogenetic analysis of XMRV that placed the retrovirusin its evolutionary family.26 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_279] Then sheclicked to another PCR gel that demonstrated XMRV protein expression inactivated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, compared with an absence of suchexpression in normal donors. Summarizing the data, she was also able to showXMRV protein expression in B and T cell lymphocytes, which had been activatedand purified.The next few slides showed the protein gels, known as Westerns. She demonstratedhow XMRV had been transferred from both activated peripheral blood mononuclearcells and patient plasma to LNCaP cells. In order to study a virus, one has tobe able to grow the virus in very large quantities in the laboratory.To provide an even more dramatic visual, she included two electron micrographpictures showing the retrovirus budding from a ME/CFS patient’s white bloodcell. All that was known from previous studies was the demonstrated presence ofthe XMRV retroviral sequences and Singh’s new data showing XMRV protein inprostate cancer biopsies.The next group of slides evidenced antibodies to the envelope of the XMRVretrovirus in several of the CFS patients and showed how the suspected RNASELvariant R462Q (Silverman’s claim) did not correlate with XMRV infection. Inother words, despite an overlapping finding of RNase L defects between prostatecancer and ME/CFS, Silverman’s claim that XMRV was directly linked to a specificgenetic mutation did not prove true in their research on ME/CFS.She then displayed her next slides: preliminary results from a ME/CFS cohort ofCheney’s in Florida and Carolina. Interestingly, the Florida and Carolina cohortshowed differing results for XMRV infection based upon which assay was used.27[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_280]When looking for just XMRV gag proteins in fresh peripheral blood mononuclearcells, 9 of 15 samples were positive for an infection rate of 60 percent. Butwhen combining western blot for XMRV envelope and gag proteins upon co-cultureof plasma or peripheral blood mononuclear cells with LNCaP, 13 of the 15 sampleswere positive for an infection rate of 86.7 percent. If one simply looked atwhether the plasma samples contained antibody to the XMRV envelope, the rate was8 out of 15 for an infection rate of 53 percent.The important takeaway seemed to be that depending on the assay used theinfection rate among the same 15 samples could vary from a low of 53 percent toa high of 86.7 percent. None of these were miniscule or chance-drivenpercentages, but to assure the highest accuracy, careful processing and usingmultiple tests was key.Toward the end of the presentation, Mikovits showed a slide listing twentyNevada CFS patients with cancer or suspicious biopsy findings. As she spoke, thesomberness of these slides seemed to sink in; this audience understood thelanguage of cancer more concretely than the vague misnomer of “chronic fatiguesyndrome.” Mikovits noted how quiet and attentive the entire group was as theyriveted their gaze on the slides and took in all the cases of mantle celllymphoma, thymoma, and myelodysplasia. These words seemed to humanize thepresentation for them.Of her many former colleagues from the NCI all understood the gravity and lackof knowledge of pathophysiology of cancer, despite more than forty years ofstudy. Mikovits could almost see in their eyes a shift in their thinking as theyconsidered reawakening an idea which had long ago been proposed but for whichover the years there had been precious little evidence.Could many cases of cancer be the consequence of a decades-long retroviralinfection? The implications of this would be mind-boggling, shifting at leastsome cancer research into the field of infectious disease.* * *In the final slides Mikovits put forth her conclusions and the formidablechallenges that lay ahead. First, she conveyed that infectious XMRV had beenfound in lymphocytes and plasma from slightly less than 75 percent of ME/CFSpatients. She noted that XMRV in ME/CFS and prostate cancer were closely relatedand formed a distinct phylogenetic (evolutionary and genetic) branch.She also reiterated that her team discovered an immune response had beendetected in some ME/CFS patients and their evidence indicated the retroviruscaused a neuro-immune deficiency predisposing the patients to cancer.Alarmingly, she also put forth that the rate of positive infection in thegeneral population suggested that the public was at significant risk from XMRVand that millions in the United States alone could be impacted.While it was unclear how many detours this pathogen could take as it spawnedillness, it seemed that it could be a factor in both extremely debilitating anddeadly disease.She underscored the challenges ahead: development of an accurate diagnostictest, therapy for those already infected, and perhaps a vaccine to protect thepublic, if one could be developed. When she finished talking, she scanned theroom and saw barely a fidget or the flick of a pen cap. The energy was taut asthe scientists absorbed the implications of what Mikovits had just said. Theyall seemed dumbfounded, the slides now after-images of a horrific, uncontainedcrisis.A large-scale scientific calamity had been brought to light and most of themlooked wary of blinking. Finally, a scientist broke the dead air, standing up toask a question that prompted a barrage of questions directed at Mikovits, aswell as animated whispering among the other scientists.28[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_281]Frank Ruscetti later told Mikovits that at that moment, Coffin leaned over toDr. Vineet Kewal Ramani, also of the HIV Drug Resistance Program, and said, “Oh,my God, you mean all those sequences we saw in the 1980s were real?”When Ruscetti told Mikovits about overhearing Coffin’s remark, she knewimmediately what it meant. It was if she and Coffin had stumbled into the samewalled city of the walking wounded, and were now privy to a macro-lensed view ofsuffering as well as its microscopic guts and gore, they now saw the sameepidemic clearly29 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_282]In the months and years to come, Coffin would be on both sides of that wall,first championing the work, and then when it appeared that XMRV had no naturalhistory of human infection, seemingly doing everything in his power to buryMikovits, though the mistake had been made years before in the original prostatecancer research.Curiously nothing was done to the investigators studying XMRV in prostatecancer.* * *All of this had, remarkably, happened before lunchtime.The gathering broke for a midday meal and Mikovits was so wired from nerves andexcitement she wondered whether she would even be able to get her wobbly legsout of the room. Adrenaline pulsed through her, but after she strode from theauditorium, she found it easy enough to scarf down a few calories because sheknew the afternoon session would be mercilessly drawn out with so much ground tocover.Some folks were abuzz with excitement at this point and others looked simplytired, but as she made her way back to the workshop she felt ready to lean inand assert her presence in what felt like a seminal moment.* * *The ensuing roundtable discussion covered a panoply of concerns, as detailed atlength in the confidential summary. They were broken down into four areas;epidemiology, basic research, procedural issues, and action items.Regarding epidemiology, the group agreed,“the most critical research goal is to rapidly assess the prevalence,distribution, mode of transmission, and diseases associated with XMRV infectionin the human population.”30 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_283]The group noted:“Abbott Laboratories has been licensed to develop diagnostic assays and hasdeveloped a first-generation anti-body based diagnostic, the prevailing opinionwas that the Abbott antibody test is not yet suitable for these purposes.”However, they designated the NCI was designated as a “repository forcoordination of samples for distribution to research groups in order todetermine the most appropriate assays.” The group tasked the Division of CancerEpidemiology and Genetics at the NCI to play a lead role in these initialefforts. The confidential summary further urged that, “Studies should addressthe mode of transmission (human to human, mouse to human) as well as themechanism.”31 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_284] Some members had raisedconcern that sexual transmission among humans was a reasonable possibility,adding to the importance of further research. Could XMRV be spread like HIV?Were unknowing victims having unsafe sex?Another major concern was that the scientific record showed mouse leukemiaviruses already caused a number of immunological and neurological diseases inanimals, creating an urgent need to determine whether such a pattern was alsoevident in human beings as Mikovits’s presentation suggested.“MLVs related to XMRV infect many tissues and organs and cause a wide variety ofmalignant and non-malignant (e.g., immunological and neurological) diseases inmice. Broad surveys to look for such associations with XMRV infection in thehuman population are critical to understand its full impact.”32[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_285]As noted in the last part of the epidemiology section, participants also voicedconcern about the blood supply, animal handlers, and lab workers.“Serious issues regarding protection of the blood supply, as well astransmission of XMRV or related viruses to risk groups such as animal handlersand laboratory workers who handle cell lines that were derived from mice, needto be addressed.”33 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_286]This, of course, could put more unknowing people at risk, from woundedhemophiliacs to veterinarians. Once epidemiological issues had been cleared fromthe agenda, the workshop participants moved swiftly to the research issues.* * *First, they addressed in the basic research discussion was the finding that theRNASEL R462Q genetic variant did not appear to be associated with XMRVinfection. “In view of presentations from several individuals (Silverman, Klein,Singh, Mikovits), the role of RNASEL in XMRV infection remains ambiguous andneeds to be clarified.”34 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_287]The question over the genetic variant—which about ten percent of the populationcarries—was important whether genetics made some individuals into resistantcarriers of the pathogen (who might simply shuttle it along yet never grow ill),or whether some people could be more likely to contract XMRV.Next, they discussed whether XMRV was “a causal agent or passenger” in prostatecancer.“The group expressed the opinion that “the clearest evidence will come fromanalysis of clonality of integration sites in tumors, particularly if they arewell placed to affect expression of known proto-oncogenes.”35[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_288]Put simply, the participants asked whether or not the retrovirus could integrateitself into places in the DNA that were known to be involved in the developmentof cancer? If the virus did integrate into such sites, the researchers wouldhave strong evidence that the infection was in fact causing cancer.The summary prodded the medical community to develop “reliable and inexpensiveanimal models mimicking XMRV infection and pathogenesis.” Even within the drylanguage, exciting momentum and collaboration seemed to shimmer on the horizon.The summary’s tone conveyed both an appropriate urgency and a respectfulgravity.The text advised it was of particular importance to develop these expandedanimal models and determine the mode of transmission “especially in light of thereport from Mikovits that XMRV can be detected in saliva.” It also noted that“additional studies are necessary to determine the role of XMRV infection inneurodegenerative disease associated with many CFS patients,”36[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_289] suggesting a longitudinal commitment tothese patients that had not been previously seen.The group also seemed to take the ME/CFS-cancer link seriously, noting that,“the suggestion of enhanced lymphoma incidence associated with CFS should bevigorously investigated, particularly the possibility of direct involvement ofthe virus in these malignancies.”37 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_290]Jumping to the question of what treatments might be currently available usingdrugs already approved, the summary boldly asserted that, “Initiating a clinicaltrial of CFS patients treated with available antiretrovirals (such as AZT) wasproposed.” In other words, the group recognized that CFS was life-robbing enoughto warrant an immediate trial of drugs typically used for AIDS. However, Coffincompellingly argued that the high degree of sequence similarity betweendifferent XMRV isolates suggested low-level replication, “which poses a problemfor retrovirals,” since existing drugs tend to be the most effective on a“fast-moving” virus like HIV.Another issue was that even though,“XMRV is closely related to proviruses found in inbred lines, it is notidentical to any of them, and even very small sequence differences are known tohave large effects on species and tissue tropism and pathogenicity. At themoment, there is no reason to believe that XMLVs are human pathogens; however,research to investigate this issue is urgently needed.”38[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_291]The document illuminated one point: a great deal of basic research needed to bedone to answer some very important questions about XMRV.* * *Regarding procedure, the roundtable meeting tackled some riveting concernsaround biosafety, implying the seriousness of the risk to lab workers, and anescape of the virus beyond lab walls.One participant asked:“considering the oncogenic [cancer-causing] potential of XMRV, what are theappropriate biosafety guidelines? Guidance from work with HIV should proveuseful, given the basic similarity among retroviruses. Traditionally, oncogenicretroviruses are handled in the research laboratory under BL-2 [bio-safety 2]conditions. Dr. Hughes should take a lead role in discussing such issues atNCI-Frederick.”39 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_292]Second, participants addressed the significance of cell lines that had alreadybeen passaged through mouse tissue.“How does one deal with human cell lines that have been passaged through miceand have a high likelihood of carrying infectious XMLV? This is a major concernfor researchers using these cell lines, for issues of biosafety as well asexperimental contamination.”40 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_293]Similar concerns were raised about anyone who worked with the mice.Of course, the potential runaway train of public hysteria and panic were alsoaddressed.“With these concerns in mind, how does one present the potential health hazardassociated with XMRV infection to the general public? Given the publication ofmany of the results presented at this meeting is imminent, this issue isparticularly urgent.”41 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_294]Because so many of the research findings were on the verge of being publishedthe participants generally concurred,“The NCI should have a procedural plan in place as an immediate follow-up toplanned press releases from the participating institutions involved in theassociation of XMRV infection with CFS. Other NIH institutes (NIAID, NHLBI) andfederal agencies (FDA, CDC, RAC) should be notified of the NCI response prior torelease of this statement.”42 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_295]If one reviews the summary from a retrospective distance, the participatingagencies seem to be as calibrated as a Swiss watch, showing both appropriatepublic concern and the want of a timely response. Given the relative lack ofdiscord, it is almost impossible to imagine this same group scattering orparticipating in infighting. There is little ominous futurity in thiswell-calibrated watch group, where the response seems both optimistic andappropriate.At this very early point of investigation into XMRV there was evidence of itbeing involved in a quarter of prostate cancers, an overwhelmingly majority ofME/CFS cases, a connection to various types of lymphomas, and an infection rateamong the general public which varied in studies from 3.75 percent in theMikovits cohort to 6 percent in the Singh group, so most of the participantsseemed aware that they were dealing with a significant potential threat topublic health.They were, in fact, revving up to go ahead with an action plan.* * *The action plan broke down into five parts.First, Le Grice, the cochair of the meeting, with Coffin, would summarize themeeting and circulate the report to the participants for their comments andcorrections.Second, a special team would meet two days later, on July 24, 2009, to discusspressing action items.“The consensus was that the most immediate actions should be theevaluation/improvement of currently available diagnostic reagents, which wouldenable epidemiological studies to better understand the extent of XMRV infectionin cancer patients and the general public.”43[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_296]The third action item concerned identifying the best way to develop a reliablediagnostic test.“Also, the general opinion was that a diagnostic test developed by Abbott is notyet sufficiently reliable, although details were not available. Thus, it wassuggested that NCI should play a leading role in providing a panel of positiveand negative samples for extramural researchers to test individual assays.”44[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_297]Abbott Laboratories did not have a reliable diagnostic test and it seemed theparticipants were skeptical of Abbott’s ability to develop one.The fourth action item belied a curious paternalism regarding how the roundtablegroup wanted to release information on XMRV to the general public. In full, thispart of the confidential summary reads:“A sensitive issue is the need for NCI senior leadership to issue a statement inparallel with a planned release linking XMRV with CFS, which is planned forsimultaneous release by three institutions. The response to a report that anMLV-based retrovirus is potentially oncogenic and infects humans could rangefrom a responsible scientific reaction to the hysteria that accompanies internetreports, and the NCI should be positioned to make an appropriate statement.Dr. Coffin will prepare a draft letter for distribution/discussion among meetingparticipants and ultimate submission to the NCI Director.Dr. Coffin has also proposed that Jon Cohen of Science be brought in to providethe appropriate perspective for the public.Sharing this information with other NIH (NIAID, NHLB) and federal (CDC, FDA,RAC) institutions and at the appropriate time is important.”45[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_298]* * *Is it possible that the “responsible” reaction to evidence that a retrovirus isinvolved in more than a quarter of cases of the most common type of cancer amongmen, in a debilitating disease like ME/CFS, which is estimated to affect onemillion people in the United States and seventeen million people across theworld, as well as in many cases of lymphoma, would be a little bit of hysteria?Would the public’s interest in having a clear and unobstructed answer to thesequestions be such a bad thing? Weren’t the scientists involved in “public”health?As the roundtable group deliberated about how to best manage this information,they needed to appoint their designated writer. The man who later evolved intoMikovits’s nemesis had an answer. “Dr. Coffin has also proposed that Jon Cohenof Science be brought in to provide the appropriate perspective for the public.”While some might see nothing wrong with this arrangement and might eagerlyanticipate having the “appropriate perspective” offered by “Jon Cohen ofScience,” others might view this as something more akin to a well-oiledcorporate communications strategy, rather than the rough and tumble of a freepress. After all, scientific journals were not supposed to play dual roles ofreviewing scientific papers and doing public relations for a national healthcrisis: this could surely be considered a conflict of interest. If scientificcuriosity was legitimately based on objectivity, shouldn’t data be presentedwithout the filter of a public relations strategy?What a person thinks about such affairs will likely be determined by theirbelief about whether any group of individuals working in isolation away from theeyes of the public, can be trusted to decide which information should bepresented to or withheld from the citizenry. It is well-known among scientiststhat the most important part of a publication is not the data you show but thedata you do not show. Unfortunately, Mikovits had been trained by Ruscetti toshow all of the data.One thing was clear. The group that met at the National Cancer Institute on July22, 2009, to discuss XMRV determined that this information had to be carefullymanaged. And “Jon Cohen of Science,” was Coffin’s ideal man for the job.* * *In the fifth action item, the roundtable group talked about the possible threatto researchers who worked in labs containing cell lines that had been passagedthrough mouse tissue.To Mikovits, the workshop, although unexpected and unusual in many respects, hadbeen a complete success.As soon as she was able to pry herself away from the other participants, sheeagerly called Harvey and Annette Whittemore who were in Reno awaiting word fromthe conference. She knew the Whittemores would understand a sports analogy, soshe exclaimed, “World Series, game 7, ninth inning, grand slam, walk-off!” Aftergiving them that positive report of success, she delivered the highlights of therest of the meeting.Mikovits knew from experience that the NCI would start to go into scale-up modeto study all the questions raised about XMRV. She had first joined the NCI as ayoung lab technicin shortly after HTLV-1 had been discovered. Now she couldn’thelp but feel she’d been present at the birth of something similar to HIV withXMRV. Judy Mikovits and Frank and Sandy Ruscetti celebrated that night at arestaurant in Frederick, Maryland that Mikovits had frequented when she lived inthe area.Frank drove her to the Washington/Dulles airport the next morning and droppedher off. She was in an airport lounge when her cell rang. The woman quicklyidentified herself as an editor from Science. “I just sent you an email,” shesaid hurriedly. “Did you get it?”46 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach8fn_299]The urgency in the woman’s voice was not something one expected from the editorof the world’s most prestigious journal of “original research.” The editor askedthat Mikovits send all of the data from the manuscript because they needed tostart working on editing the article.Mikovits explained she was in an airport lounge and didn’t have the figures onher iPhone.“Okay, then just send me the text, the Word document. We’ll get working onthat.”Mikovits told her she would do that immediately.After sending the Word document to Science, Mikovits took another sip of wineand allowed herself a wry smile. Did she really believe that the phone call fromthe editor at Science had come because the three referees had finally made itthrough the paper and deemed it worthy of publication in just ten days?Not a chance in hell.In all likelihood, the lead of those three “anonymous” referees were among thetwenty-two leading scientists gathered for the XMRV workshop at the NCI, walkingincognito among the attendees while they ate their lunch.It was also no stretch of the imagination to say her work had been vetted byresearchers from the leading research institutions, including ColumbiaUniversity, the Cleveland Clinic, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, andthe University of Utah, multiple branches of the NCI, the CDC, the FDA, andindustry, in the form of the Science Applications International Corporation.So who did she have to thank for the expediting call from Science?It could have been John Coffin, who just happened to mention that Jon Cohen fromScience should be the one to provide the “appropriate perspective for thepublic.”She phoned Harvey and Annette Whittemore again, told them of the conversationand said, “We’re in!”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINEDay Four in JailI had gone in and found we were locked out of our labs. The key card accessdidn’t work and it appeared when I looked in that Judy’s drawers had been gonethrough in her desk. And it was weird because her office door was open. Shealways locks the doors, and this door wasn’t even shut. It was cracked open. Herstuff had been gone through so I let her know.—Max Pfost, on what he observed at the WPIon the day after Mikovits was terminated.1 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach9fn_300]Monday, November 21, 2011A jarring 5:45 a.m. breakfast announcement roused Mikovits from her unyieldingjail cell bed, and she thought this was the day she would finally see her lawyerand make bail.2 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach9fn_301] She stretched her limbs,marveling how even a mattress could be made to feel punitive. She was comfortedby the belief that whatever pressure was meant to be exerted on her, the factswould now begin to sort themselves out.It had been the perfect moment to arrest her, a Friday afternoon at the end of awaning work week, and who knew if anybody had expected this mysterious “bailhold” to keep her in jail over the weekend. Mikovits rationally concluded thatby late Friday afternoon, the situation had so baffled and hampered theauthorities, that they decided to address her case after Monday morning coffee.Even though Mikovits did not realize it then, she had not been abandoned overthe weekend by either her family or her professional colleagues.Two days previously, David had told her that Frank Ruscetti and Ian Lipkin ofColumbia were trying to reason with Harvey on Judy’s behalf, an account laterverified by Ian Lipkin in the pages of the journal Nature.Before she was incarcerated, I tried to negotiate some sort of agreement betweenher and the institute, so that this would not happen. One of the problems wasthat she really did need access to her laboratory notebooks so that she couldanswer questions from scientists and patients, and she was not given an optionto do that.3 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach9fn_302]Frank Ruscetti would also provide an account of what happened in the wake ofMikovits’s arrest in a declaration from May 17, 2012. Ruscetti explained:“After Dr. Judy Mikovits was arrested and incarcerated in the Ventura CountyJail, I spoke with several members of the scientific community, including IanLipkin, MD, Mike Busch, Mary Carrington, Mike Dean, Frank Maldarelli, SteveBartelmez, and others. We were all in a state of shock and outrage that ascientist could be arrested for possessing data notebooks. As demonstratedbelow, WPI’s data notebooks do not contain any trade secrets or proprietaryinformation. Moreover, research scientists are always provided with copies oftheir federally funded research notes.”4 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach9fn_303]In the seemingly murky waters of intellectual property, both sides superficiallyseem to have merit. From the WPI’s perspective, shouldn’t an institution own theresults of research that it sponsors to exploit for financial gain? However, theWPI is a non-profit, taxpayer-supported institution. Shouldn’t everything fromsuch a facility belong to the taxpayers and donors who support its research?Conversely, doesn’t an academic researcher possess a personal responsibility topublish articles based on that work in scientific journals and add not only tothe store of human knowledge, but also to his or her own academic reputation andthat of her students? To Mikovits the truth was straightforward from theperspective of science.She was the principal investigator on three government grants (R01, Lipkin, andDOD). These awards came with duties and obligations, with her paramountresponsibility being the protection of public monies as well as upholding theintegrity of the scientific work that such funds had purchased. She believedthere was nothing foggy about it, as her moral compass pointed right outside ofthe institution’s doors toward the greater public need.But even if each side felt strongly about their position, there were others forwhom the entire affair was astounding. Lipkin later recalled:To try to adjudicate some sort of agreement so she doesn’t go to jail, it’s alittle beyond the pale. I hope I never do anything like this again.5[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach9fn_304]But Mikovits didn’t have the luxury of walking away from the situation. Herprofessional reputation was on the line. She believed the real reason for hercurrent legal difficulties was because (1) of what she had said in Ottawa inAugust when the results of the Blood Working Group had been revealed, and (2)she had prevented Lombardi from using the grant-funded cells and thus insuredthat the WPI could not claim salary support for him as he had done no work inthe research program that year. For others it may have been a question ofinterpretation, but Mikovits felt allowing a researcher to do a day of work on agrant, then claiming part of his salary for a much greater time period, wasunethical.Mikovits believed the information, contained in her notebooks and personale-mail record, was evidence to her claims and would likely convince the NIH toallow her to take the grants to another institution that could support them.She did not fear anything in the notebooks. That’s why she was trying to protectthem. Let the world read them. She had nothing to hide.* * *At around four o’clock on a dragging afternoon, jail personnel received a callthat Mikovits had a pastoral visit.6 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach9fn_305]Free-time didn’t come until much later, and Marie had slept most of the day. Shewas prepared and led to the visiting area.Waiting for her in that space—the one without a Hollywood plastic window butwith a rather bland institutional table and chairs—was no pastor but her fill-inattorney, Tom Adams, who was covering while Dennis Neil Jones was recoveringfrom a knee replacement.“Hi, Tom,” said Judy lightly, not sure of the proper formalities.He was friendly enough in return. “Hi, Judy.”She thought of all the retrospective things she could take him to task on now,such as “See?—wasn’t I correct that people were following me before I wasarrested?” and “do you remember how I called you up on Friday morning and youassured me that there was no warrant out for my arrest?” How could somebody bearrested when there was no warrant out?She wished she had been irrationally paranoid instead of right.Tom leaned forward soberly. “Judy, Max Pfost called your husband and told himyou had the notebooks and you knew you had the notebooks.”“I don’t have the notebooks. I never saw the contents of the bag of materialsMax secured when he found my office open and ransacked the morning after I wasfired.”Mikovits saw a look of disbelief sweep over Tom’s face as he firmed up: “Judy,you need to tell your lawyers the truth.” Maybe it was the lack of sleep or thepetty indignities of being in jail, but Mikovits felt spitting mad.“Tom, I did tell you the truth! You had selective hearing before my arrest. Youdidn’t even ask me what happened on those crucial days of October 16th and 17th.You asked what happened within seventy-two hours of when I’d been fired and if Ihad ever been back to the WPI. Then without any warning, I’m in jail. Theaffidavit you tried to file, which the court mysteriously rejected, isinaccurate to boot because you didn’t listen. To top it off, I am blindsided anddragged off to a cell, when you claimed there wasn’t even a warrant out for myarrest! How exactly could this happen?”“Well, just tell me what’s going on.”“You tell me what’s going on!” she snapped.Tom put his elbows on the table, as if settling in to let the story uncoil.“Okay. Max called David and said, ‘The jig is up!’”Mikovits almost laughed at the hardboiled, archaic expression. The jig is up!?Only Harvey Whittemore talked like that: it had to be a borrowed phrase.Max Pfost and Harvey Whittemore had a complicated relationship. As Max recountedin a 2014 interview “I could never figure him out. Sort of a sly guy. I kind offelt like he was a friend, a nice guy, but I think he manipulates things. Yeah,I think manipulator is a good word.”7 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach9fn_306]Later, Max would tell Mikovits that Harvey Whittemore was listening on the phoneline when he had phoned David.8 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach9fn_307] AfterMikovits had been fired and Max had kept her informed of eerie happenings at theWPI, like the shutting down of the lab for a week and the brusque removal ofeverything from the labs and from her office, Max grew fearful that his takingof the notebooks would be discovered.These fears would lead Max to make some decisions he would later regret,especially the trust he would give to Harvey Whittemore. As Pfost recalled inthat same 204 interview, “It was after I was meeting with Harvey’s lawyers andthey were grilling me pretty good, and they dropped me back at home. And I wassitting there, worked up, and so at the time I felt like Harvey was looking outfor my best interests, this whole thing. Because he was putting in my mind thatJudy was out to set me up [with] this whole taking the notebooks so it lookslike I’m the fall guy.”9 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach9fn_308]Tom continued the story, saying that David didn’t know what Max was saying. ButMax had pressed on, saying he knew that Judy had the notebooks. David told himthey’d unpacked all the boxes from Judy’s Reno condominium after she wasterminated and there was nothing there.Mikovits sat back. What she’d just heard about Max was deeply disquietingbecause she had not taken the notebooks, Max had, and Mikovits did not knowwhere they were. So why was Max being evasive? It was hard to fathom a motiveeven though his fear was palpable. She thought maybe Max was being truthful yetplaying an unintentional shell game with the notebooks. Or maybe Max had takenthe notebooks to copy them, in order to protect her when he left in the earlymorning hours of October 17th to meet a friend. Or maybe Max had packed them soshe would not know their exact location, just in case she was stopped andquestioned by someone connected to Harvey Whittemore.“So, do you have the notebooks or don’t you?” Tom probed.“Well, I don’t know,” Dr. Mikovits replied. She would have to describe the nightof October 16–17, after her plane landed in Reno at one o’clock in the morning,up until Max left at eight a.m. for his job at the WPI. She took a deep breathand plunged into her story.She wanted to impress upon Tom Adams the absolute importance of “the notebook”in scientific research.From the days of Leonardo Da Vinci, the notebook of a scientist provided anincorruptible record of one’s research, thoughts, questions, and conclusions ata specific point in time. Da Vinci’s own notebooks display his forward-thinkingcontribution to history; they show graceful sketches of a manned glider based onthe wings of birds, blueprints for the first tank, even the principles thatwould enable helicopters to fly.Protocol might have changed over the centuries, but the basic pattern remainedconsistent. First and foremost, a daily record of labwork was kept. Any attemptto alter the contents, such as ripping out the page for a less-than-successfulday, was obvious. The system is low-tech but incredibly effective. The notebookhad to remain intact.The notebooks of Mikovits held the key to resolving the controversy ragingaround XMRV, the validity of the diagnostic test by VIP Dx, and so much more.Mikovits didn’t care if the notebooks proved or debunked her theory. They simplyneeded to be maintained and protected so future researchers could determinewhether she had been right or wrong. That was how science moved forward atop asolid cogwheel of proof and disproof, made up of simply-scribed data in a basicnotebook.Beyond the imperative of science to present the unvarnished truth, Mikovits hada deeper motivation. The research contained in those notebooks had been boughtand paid for by US taxpayers who wanted answers, and they held names linking tocoded identifications of more than 800 study participants whom she had vowed toprotect with scientific confidentiality. From a populist and a scientific pointof view, they did not belong to a singular institution or person.* * *She had to impress upon Tom the other critical piece: that she believed theWhittemores were in serious financial trouble, which she felt was enough to foganyone’s mind and generate impulsive behavior. This claim would be echoed in thelawsuit later brought by the former partners of the Whittemores, the Seenofamily of Concord, California, which would paint a similar picture ofdesperation.With that in mind, Mikovits began to recount the events for Tom Adams.Annette Whittemore fired Mikovits over the phone at around 4:30 p.m. onThursday, September 29, 2011.It was an uneventful day prior to the Lombardi brouhaha. Mikovits had left theWhittemore Peterson Institute about a half hour earlier after going to the labto tell her research associate Shanti Rawat that she would be taking the nextday to move David’s possessions out of the Condo they had been renting the pastten months from the Whittemores as her Riverwalk condo was being repaired frommold. Mikovits would then be moving her things back to the Riverwalk as herlease was up September 30. David would be moving back home to Oxnard and Judywould commute to Reno beginning in October of 2011. It had all be prearrangedwhen Judy gave the Whittemores notice of her intentions by email in August of2011. Mikovits told Rawat she was placing the office keys in the lab drawer asusual and that she would fly back on Monday morning, mentioning that theWhittemores were aware of her plans, and that Max was helping her move. Mikovitsadded a cordial “Have a nice weekend.”The call from Lombardi came in on her cell phone as she was walking down thestreet. Lombardi said, gruffly, “Tell me where the cells are. They were sent tome.”Mikovits snapped, “Didn’t I tell you that you were no longer part of theresearch program? I will be back on Monday and we can discuss it then.” She hungup quickly. Annette Whittemore swooped in immediately, calling Mikovits’s cellphone about a minute later and no longer playing nice.Annette screamed, “You give him those cells! They were shipped to him.”“I told you Lombardi is no longer in the research program. I am the Principalinvestigator (PI) and responsible for all resources on all projects in theprogram. Those cells were purchased off the R01 grant without my knowledge orpermission. That is illegal. I told you given his failure to perform in the BWG,Lombardi was no longer in my program.”Annette seemed frantic. “I have had enough of your insolence.”“So it is rude to stop fraud and misappropriation of federal funds? I am theresearch director and I said no.”“You are no longer the research director,” Annette proclaimed, “You you arefired!”At first Mikovits just stared at the phone. As she stood on the street, Maxarrived to take her to pick up the rental car from the airport. Max saw her faceand immediately asked what was wrong.“Annette had a hissy fit and fired me, but she’ll get over it.” There had beenan incident the past spring where Mikovits had threatened to quit because ofwhat she viewed as a conflict of interest involving Lombardi and VIP Dx, whichshe thought it had been resolved. That’s one thing which was so difficult tolater convey to people. For the vast majority of her time working in Nevada,Judy had trusted the Whittemores. They had worked through their problems, as dopeople who deeply respected each other.“Well, what do you want to do?” asked Max.“We have a job to do. I have to move David’s stuff out of Harvey’s apartment,”she replied.Little did she know that this time there would be no reconciliation.* * *The first inkling that things were not going to bounce back came at five a.m.the next morning when Max called. “I’m really concerned because I can’t get intothe WPI building. My key card access isn’t working,” he said.Max wanted to run a gel for an experiment and as most students, he usuallyworked odd hours. He was upset by the events of the previous evening and thusarrived at the WPI around five in the morning. He had put the gel in therefrigerator the day before and wanted to get it started since it usually tookseveral hours to run the experiment. Mikovits was an early riser as well, butthe experience of being fired had made her sleep fitful and unreliable. All shewanted to do was get in the packed SUV and drive home to southern California andto David.She left with an SUV containing David’s clothes around three-thirty in themorning and was just outside of Sacramento in northern California when Max’scall came. He could not find a way into the building.She told him it probably wasn’t anything to worry about as there had been priorbreak-ins and a lack of security since the new academic building had opened andperhaps the key code access had been changed for that reason. She suggested hecome back at seven a.m. when the doors to the building were supposed toautomatically open. When Max returned at seven he was able to get through theinitial doors, but then his key card did not allow him access to his own labcontaining the keys to his own office. While there, he saw that Mikovits’soffice was unlocked, her drawers were open, and it looked like somebody hadrifled through them, plus her flash drives were on her desk.10[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach9fn_309]He called her in a panic. “Now I am really scared. It is not like you to leaveyour office unlocked.”“Describe what is going on,” she asked him in a calm voice.“Your desk drawers are open,” he said.“Is anything gone?” Mikovits asked.“I don’t know what was in there.”Mikovits conjured up a mental picture of her office. “Which desk drawers?”“The ones in the main desk.”“Is the file behind the main desk open? The one where the textbooks are?”“No, it’s locked,” said Max. “I will take a picture of your desk with my phoneand send it to you.”Mikovits looked at the image Max had sent and allowed a sigh of relief. Shedidn’t know what was going on, but the notebooks had to be secured. The deskdrawers were open and unlocked but the contents appeared to be fairlyundisturbed as each drawer was full to the top. The confrontation with Lombardihad been the final straw in what she suspected were a string of unethical,foolish, and possibly illegal acts at the WPI. She had wrestled with the issueof whether they were simply innocent mistakes or a pattern of something moresinister. What was it the police always asked in a murder investigation? Withwhom did the victim last have an argument? It was not the final judgment, but itwas a good place to start.She’d had an argument with the Whittemores whom she felt were disgruntledbecause of the events of the Blood Working Group diagnostic tests and Lombardi’sremoval from her research program. She had been fired by Annette Whittemore forinsolence and insubordination only twelve hours earlier, and now her office hadbeen ransacked: a string of events that surpassed coincidence.Aside from what looked like evidence of the Whittemores’ actions, Mikovitsbelieved the notebooks contained evidence of Lombardi’s mistakes and a cover-upof his failure to perform. There was a reason that of all the drawers and filesin her two offices only those two drawers had been opened and Mikovits knew whatit was. She believed there were a fair number of people at the WPI who wouldfind the information in her notebooks to be at the very least, embarrassing, ifnot downright incriminating.“What should I do?” Max asked anxiously.At the time of her termination, there had been a great deal of controversy overwhether contamination could explain the XMRV results. The lab books would be anunvarnished record of what had happened.Max clearly understood their importance, as he later recalled. “We’d always hadthese lab meetings with the concern of the lab being contaminated. And we prettymuch did everything we did to figure out how our lab could be contaminated. Inone of the notebooks, I think it was Katy’s notebook, there was a lab meetingthat Vinnie Lombardi was asking to pull out the plasmids in the bacterial cells,and grow it up. And Judy said no to that. It was in the notebooks. Judy said,‘No, don’t do that, it could only get the virus everywhere.’ And I think Katyalso put an email attachment into her notebook that said, no we’re not going todo that because Judy told me not to do that. We were afraid that page or thatnotebook would just end up missing, and then, I don’t know, there would be alawsuit where everything would get blamed on us.”11[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach9fn_310]Mikovits told him he needed to secure the notebooks. “Put them in the lab! Putthem in your office! I don’t care!”“I can’t get into the lab or my office!” he replied, a little panicked.“Take them to my condo, then.”“Harvey has the key to your condo, remember?”“Take them to your mother’s place then, for Christ’s sake! Just secure them!They have patient data and information. I don’t really care what you do, butsecure them until I can get back and see what’s going on.”“This is my work, too,” said Max protectively.She knew Max well enough that she felt she could almost hear the wheels in hishead turning, that he would be appalled at the idea of Lombardi taking creditfor work he hadn’t done.She asked him to do one more thing: to go down to her old office in the AppliedResearch facility and make certain it was secure, and then call back. He calleda half hour later and said it was locked and that he did not have the key.“That’s okay,” Mikovits reassured him. The data in her old office, the data fromPeterson and her earlier work were safe because the keys were on the ring sheleft in the lab with Shanti that day—or were they?Dr. Mikovits knew she could entrust Max to protect the notebooks. She continuedher trek to southern California.* * *As the recently fired director of research at the WPI, Mikovits now had adilemma. She was scheduled to travel to the United Kingdom and Ireland fromOctober 7–16 to give a series of talks in Tulamore, Newry, Belfast, andSunderland. Should she still go?Once home in Oxnard with David, she emailed and called the groups in the UnitedKingdom and Ireland to inform them of recent events. They still wanted her tocome and said they would minimize the issue of her recent firing. Mikovitsthought that was a good idea, telling her hosts she was sure Annette would getover it, that she was simply mad about the diagnostic test, and that by the timeMikovits returned from abroad the storm would in all likelihood have passed.She felt a special bond with the UK/Irish sufferers of the disease, and wasgrateful to turn her attention to something positive and also far from home. Theprevious October and May she had traveled to the United Kingdom and Ireland fora series of talks. One in particular, her talk in Belfast on May 22, 2011, hadtouched her. The event was held in the largest meeting room at the Holiday Inn.Most of those in attendance were patients with ME/CFS and their loved ones. Atable was set up at the front of the room with the members of the panel,including Dr. William Weir, an infectious disease consultant who chaired themeeting, and Member of Parliament, Basil McCrea.Joan McParland, who had recently founded a ME/CFS support group, opened themeeting. “I’m finished with potions, lotions, and quacks,” she said in herintroductory remarks. “It’s time for some real science.”Along the wall at the front of the room was a picture display of patients withME/CFS, listing their names, and how long they’d been ill. To Mikovits, itlooked like the sort of memorial display one might have seen twenty-five yearsearlier during the height of the AIDS epidemic or after the attacks of September11, 2001. Many of the people in the pictures were not physically present,immobilized by the illness, but Mikovits knew they would be waiting for adetailed report of what had happened at the conference.As she looked out at the crowd of people, she thought with sadness of the pricemany would pay in the following days and weeks. The post-extertional malaise, orPEM, of many ME/CFS sufferers meant that any extra energy they expended, such asgoing to listen to a conference for several hours, would cost them dearly withpunishing symptoms. More than a few of the people in the audience would probablyspend the next few days or weeks in bed, trying to recover to their priorfunctioning, just from a trivial outing. Many could not even consider attending:the physical payback would be too severe.Mikovits was moved by the story told by the mother of a nineteen-year old sonwith ME/CFS and another family of a cute twelve year old brown-haired boystanding nervously beside his mother, father, and brother. One mother told ofhow one of the doctors had blamed her son for his condition, claiming he hadcaused his own joints to swell, a physical impossibility.Another doctor blamed the mother because she had painted her son’s bedroom acolor he didn’t like. Mikovits believed that future scientists would look backin horror at how these patients had been treated.At the end of her talk they had presented her with a hurley, a wooden stick thatlooked like a large paddle, used in the Irish sport of hurling. President BarackObama was given a similar hurley stick in 2011 by the Prime Minister of Ireland.At the time Obama quipped that he would use it on members of Congress. When thehurley was presented to Mikovits she had wondered aloud, “How am I going to getthis past Homeland Security?” On the hurley stick, the members of the committeehad engraved the Irish expression Tiocfaidh ar la, which means, “Our day willcome.”Mikovits loved these patients who could cling to a phrase of uplift in the midstof struggle. She was glad that even though the WPI had fired her, the Englishand Irish communities still waited with rapt attention for her to discuss herresearch.She would not let them down.* * *If the Ireland trip was supposed to lift her spirits, the news from Reno,relayed by a harried Max, only deepened her concern.According to Pfost, after she was fired, the lab had been shut down for sevensolid days from September 29 to October 7, in a hasty lockdown.12[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach9fn_311] Max had remained locked out of the lab,unable to work. The Whittemores claimed it was a “vacation” for the staff withpay.When Max was able to get back into the lab on October 8, he found they had quiteliterally stripped the lab of everything in it. They had confiscated thereagents, the computers, and the notebooks of every worker out of the lab. TheWhittemores took Max’s notebooks and personal computer.Pfost said that when they returned his personal computer it had been wipedclean. Given his close relationship to her, Pfost remained a subject ofsuspicion. As he later related, “I wasn’t allowed to do any work. I believe Ihad my office for a good time. I caught up on three television shows, like fiveseasons. Just watching in my office because I didn’t have any work, but I wasstill required to show up every day. If I did any work he [Lombardi] wouldsupervise the work over my shoulder.”13 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach9fn_312]Max also told Mikovits that while she was in Ireland, they had completely guttedher office. All of this was sounding very suspicious, and Mikovits was relievedMax had gone back to the lab in the early morning hours of September 30 and beenable to secure the key notebooks and files from her desk drawers.Why were they seizing all the data and reagents from the research laboratory?She worried they were planning to manipulate the data in the computer.Mikovits’s greatest fear was that the Whittemores were going to create their ownnarrative of the past five years justifying her censure and demise. As part ofthis rewritten history, she also feared they were going to claim Lombardi hadbeen working in the research lab, even though he had not, so they could chargethe government for part of his salary.Mikovits was also clear in her belief that Lombardi had not done a singleexperiment in the research laboratory in all of fiscal year (FY) 2011. And allof that information was in the notebooks of both Mikovits and thosecollaborators who worked with her since she had moved into the new office inAugust of 2010. Mikovits strongly believed that Katy Hagen’s notebook would showthat on March 23rd, 2009, Lombardi had directed Hagen to pull out the patients’cells and culture them along with Silverman’s VP62 XMRV expressing LNCaP inMikovits’s own lab, in direct violation of her orders, raising the possibilityof contamination.While this took place after the most critical experiments, it introduced anelement of uncertainty in the work, one which would take a great deal of effortto refute. Those two drawers also contained the sequences of viruses generatedin Ruscetti’s lab. Data supporting evidence of retroviruses other than VP62, asshe had shown Harvey in July of 2011.And if any of this had indeed happened, as Mikovits feared, it would all bedocumented in the notebooks.* * *Mikovits flew into Reno on October 17, 2011, arriving at about one in themorning. Max picked her up in his jeep. He had just turned thirty years old andin the back of his jeep was that orange and yellow celebratory birthday bag. Hepointed to the bag and said, “I’ve got the notebooks.”14[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach9fn_313]He told her he had dropped off and then later picked up the notebooks from hismother’s house and that they were all secure. Mikovits nodded and they drove tothe condo she owned, known as “The Riverwalk” condo.Once at Mikovits’s condo, Max handed her a beer and she stood at the stand-upbar between the kitchen and living room. She took a sip and paused to look outthe window at the lights of Reno, the self-proclaimed “Biggest Little City inthe World!”How had it all come to this?“Okay, Max, here’s my plan,” she said, pointing to the yellow and orangestriped, cheerful birthday bag that now held the notebooks. “When you go to workin the morning, I’m going to go back to the Whittemore condo at the Palladio toget the last of my stuff, then I will take the notebooks to the Kinkos aroundthe corner and copy them. Then I’m going to pack the car and head out of here.”Her mind was focused on getting duplicates of the data so that the record oftheir work would not be destroyed.Max said he had already started packing her things from the Whittemore-ownedcondo at the Palladio condo she had been living at for the last 15 months andpointed to some U-Haul boxes scattered about the living room. “I’ve got yourthings on that side of the room and mine on the other.” She saw how he hadtidily sectioned off their possessions in that big open room with the slidingglass doors that framed a sweeping view of the church and Sierra Nevadas.It was clear to Mikovits that Max felt threatened and perhaps even stalked byHarvey Whittemore, but what he did next completely shocked her.15[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach9fn_314]Max left the room, went down the hallway, and returned with what looked like asmall packing box, not much bigger than a shoebox. He opened the box.Inside was a shining silver Glock 19 handgun.16[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach9fn_315] The Glock 19, a petite pistol; looking likeit might fit inside a woman’s handbag. It’s made for concealment, a small weaponthat an attacker wouldn’t know the victim had until it was too late. Maxencouraged her to take the gun for protection.Mikovits felt a sudden, overwhelming chill: the gun punctuated all of the wordsthat had recently passed between them about the strange goings-on. As ascientist, a person who valued reason above brute force, it looked alien. Shefelt as if she had slipped into a dangerous netherworld.“Oh, Max, now you’re being a bit paranoid here,” she said, hoping to lighten themood.When later asked why he even owned the Glock, Max replied, “Because I’m inNevada and it’s fun to shoot guns.” He told her not to go to the other condo atthe Palladio or Kinkos.17 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach9fn_316]Max continued. “And Harvey’s been stalking me the last two or three days.”18[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach9fn_317] It was clear that Max was very concernedabout their safety and felt that he had reason to worry.“Max, I am not going to use that gun!” she protested.“Then don’t leave this condo,” he said, heatedly. “Don’t leave for anything.Pack up tomorrow and I’ll text you when the meeting starts, so you will knowit’s safe to leave and pick up the rental car.” Lombardi was having his firstofficial meeting the next day as research director. Max was convinced everybodywould be in attendance, including Harvey. So he would check to make sureLombardi’s and Harvey and Annette’s cars were in the parking lot, and text herthen. Once he texted her that it was safe, she could then leave the condo with abaseball cap pulled down over her head and walk to the Silver Legacy casino.At the casino, she could hop a bus to the airport, pick up a rental car that wasrented in the name of a friend, and drive back to the condo to pick up herboxes. It was a stressful, but good plan.That night, before the next day’s meeting at the WPI, Max pointed to a few ofthe boxes on her side of the room. “Those are David’s books,” he said. Inaddition to being an avid reader, David also had a collection of various Bibles,as he often wanted to compare a verse in one translation to the same verse inanother. “They’re too heavy for you to move. Wait until I come home and I’llhelp you pack them in the car. I have a dolly and it will be easy for me to movethem. But please don’t leave the condo for any reason.”“Damn, I really wanted to go to the gym and work out,” Mikovits said withfrustration.“You will not be safe if you leave this condo,” Max replied sternly.19[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach9fn_318] He offered the gun again and again sheshrugged it off.“Fine, I’ll just stay here,” she replied.Max didn’t leave the gun with Mikovits, but his possession of it would prove tobe a pivotal point in coming events. She later noticed the closed box on thedesk, and thought the gun was still in it, but she was wrong.She went over to one of the briefcases she had left on September 29th (as shehad planned to return to work at the WPI the following Monday) and opened it.She found her keycard, her parking pass for the WPI, and the institute’s laptopcomputer and spent a moment gazing at them. She left them all after she wasfired because she thought Annette would get over her outburst about the cellline and the diagnostic test, and she would begin commuting to direct thegrant-funded research. After five years it was difficult to believe theirrelationship was at an end, as friends and colleagues and—itseemed—groundbreakers. She had loved the Whittemores dearly, and like a suddenlyscorned wife, she felt more grief than anger.She placed everything on the bar. “I don’t think I’m going to need these anymore,” she told Max. “Take them back after I’m out of the state.”* * *Mikovits went to her room and slipped under the covers wearing her jeans and aT-shirt. She tried to sleep but tossed and turned.She recalled that she was supposed to have lunch with her former patientcoordinator. The Whittemores had promised the woman a full time job after thenew building opened, and then hired their niece Kellen Jones instead, withouttelling anyone. The betrayal of her friend still hurt Mikovits. She texted herformer patient coordinator. She hated to lie, but given what Max had said aboutthe dangers of being seen, she did not want to risk the woman’s safety. “Imissed the plane in Santa Barbara,” she wrote. “I will see you in the nextcouple of weeks when I pick up my things, but I won’t be at the Tap Housebecause I’m not in Reno. I don’t know when I’m going to get another flight.”20[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach9fn_319]The woman texted back, “That’s fine. I’ll see you when I see you. Safe travels.”Although she drifted off for a few hours, Mikovits woke at five-thirty and wentto the living room to begin packing her clothes, towels and linens, glasses, anddishes.She noticed that Max had rescued her prized possession from the lab, the hurleygiven to her the previous May on her trip to Ireland. As she held the smoothstick, she let her fingers linger over the inscription, Tiocfaidh ar la.Our day will come.She glanced at the front door at the birthday bag that had earlier contained thenotebooks when Max had picked her up from the airport. It was now conspicuouslyempty.She thought, Well, that’s bizarre.But she could not wait to leave that gutted space: like anyone who is packed andready to hit the road, she figured she would sort out the contents of her boxeslater, once she got the heck out of Dodge.* * *“Where did you think the notebooks had gone?” Tom Adams asked.It startled Mikovits to hear him speak. She was talking for more than a halfhour, trying to relay the chain of events. As she recounted the story it had allbeen like a lucid waking dream.“Well, I’m no rocket scientist, but I thought Max packed them in my stuff toprotect me from knowing where they were. I think he was concerned that HarveyWhittemore might stop me somewhere on the road and try to get them from me.” Shepaused. “It was better if I had no idea where the notebooks were.”21[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach9fn_320]“But you thought they were there?” Tom asked.“Yes, I thought they were there. But I didn’t know if they were.”She explained to Tom Adams that after they had gone to their respective rooms tosleep at around 2:30 a.m., Max apparently left in the middle of the night tomeet up with a friend, and then went to work at 8 a.m. Around eleven o’clock hetexted her that everybody’s cars were in the parking lot. Mikovits had gotten upat 5 a.m. to get ready for her trip, so she and Max were both operating onlimited sleep.After Max texted, Mikovits put on her baseball cap, pulled it down, andfurtively left the building for the quick walk to the Silver Legacy casino whereshe caught a bus to the airport. She picked up the rental car, drove into theunderground parking, and proceeded to load up her boxes. She worked hurriedly,and soon the only boxes that remained were those containing David’s weightybooks.Max texted at about one o’clock and said the lab meeting was starting. Themeeting should only last an hour and he would probably get back to the condo bythree. When he hadn’t arrived or even texted by three fifteen, Mikovits wasgetting edgy, knowing she had at least an eight hour drive ahead of her. Shedecided to open David’s boxes herself and lighten the load so she could carrythem. She placed half of them in a recyclable container. She then put thehalf-empty box on the U-Haul dolly and took them down to the rental car,returning with the recyclable container. Mikovits loaded the remaining booksinto the half-empty box, and closed it up.She was starting to get antsy, thinking that she would not get home untilmidnight if she left any later. She texted Max and said she wanted to leave.“Hit the road, Jack!” he replied.22 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach9fn_321]Mikovits jumped in the rental car and raced out of dry and dusty Reno, checkingher rearview mirror every minute or two to see if she was being followed,smiling when she saw the highway climbing into the cool pine forests of theSierra Nevada Mountains, and breathing an enormous sigh of relief when the signon the road announced she had entered California. Harvey Whittemore might be a“Power Ranger” in Nevada, a “king of the legislature,” with a close relationshipto the leader of the US Senate, but he didn’t own California. This was her stateand it didn’t owe a damn thing to Harvey Whittemore. Stagecoach drivers had oncespurred their horses over similar routes West, glancing over their shoulders forlurking, omnipresent dangers. Mikovits revved her rented horsepower toward home.She thought about Max’s text. “Hit the Road, Jack” was of course a song by thelegendary Ray Charles. She found herself humming a few of the bars as she madeher way south.* * *Arriving around midnight, Judy went straight to bed, sleeping weightily untileight o’clock the next morning. David put on a pot of coffee and they started tounload the car. The rental car was due at the Oxnard, California, airport bynoon so David drove it back.At their beach house, Mikovits unloaded all of the boxes with the exception oftwo boxes of towels and sheets that were supposed to go to their other home, acondo near San Diego. When David returned, he carried the boxes upstairs and putthem in the linen closet for the next time they went to San Diego. At the time,as far as she knew, there were no notebooks in any of the boxes.“You really don’t expect me to believe that do you?” Tom interjected,skeptically.“I wish my attorney trusted my honesty, but that’s the truth. Did I have plansto make sure the notebooks were protected? Yes, I did. Did I think they were inthe stuff Max packed? Yes I did. But when I unpacked the boxes they were notthere. Do you think if I knew where they were when I flew to Washington, DC, onNovember 15 for my mom’s seventy-fifth birthday, I would not have taken themwith me for protection given the events of the past week? I wanted to keepcopies of the data, the patient information, and the evidence of what theWhittemores and Lombardi had done safe with me. Yet at the end of the day Ididn’t know where they were, so I didn’t ask. We did the best we could toprotect the study participants and the taxpayer funded research.”23[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach9fn_322]“Okay,” said Tom, standing and preparing to leave.“So, that’s it? What’s the plan for getting me out of here? When am I going toget bail?”“I don’t know,” said Tom. “I’m a civil attorney. You’ll have to call yourcriminal attorney.”And with that, Tom Adams turned and walked out of the jail.* * *What Mikovits didn’t know while she was in jail, what her attorney didn’t knowand might possibly have made him reconsider what he thought he knew, was whathad happened to Max since she left Nevada.While Max had played a pivotal role in securing the notebooks, he would alsoplay an equally important role in her false arrest and imprisonment. In themonths and years to come she would have her own questions about Max.Had he sincerely been concerned about her safety when she had arrived back inReno in mid-October, or had he already been compromised by Harvey Whittemore?Wouldn’t it make for an irresistible story to portray her as a gun-totingscientist with stolen notebooks? It would complete the image of a femalescientist who had gone completely off the rails. She would eventually come tobelieve Max was sincere in his actions when she arrived back in Reno after thetrip to Ireland, a week after her termination, but it seemed in the XMRVinvestigation, a little paranoia was almost a necessity.The extent of Max’s interactions with Harvey Whittemore during the followingweeks is unclear, but Harvey eventually gained the young man’s trust. Max becameconcerned that the stress was making him unstable and he was concerned abouthaving the gun.24 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach9fn_323]Max recalled, “I asked if I could meet with him. I had my gun in a bag. Harveypicked me up. I talked with him and asked him if he could take my gun for me andhold onto it or take it somewhere so I didn’t have it at my disposal. Hecontacted the university police, I think his name was Todd, and spoke with him.Then we drove to the university police and I gave my gun to them. They took itfrom me there and held onto it. Then I came back a few weeks later. I think itwas Jamie [another university police officer] who returned it to me.”25[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach9fn_324]After the gun incident (November 16, 2011), Harvey convinced Max to fill out anaffidavit (eventually two affidavits would be created) although at the time Maxhad “no clue what an affidavit was.”26 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach9fn_325] AsMax recalled, “The first one, I think this is the time I gave the gun deal up,when I got grilled by the lawyer, they had me going to jail, this and that, andI was really blown away because I didn’t feel I’d done anything wrong. So then Ijust explained everything that went on.27 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach9fn_326]“My whole intention was I didn’t want those things [the notebooks] disappearingbecause I really didn’t understand what was going on. But it seemed that it wasvery important to keep those notebooks intact so they didn’t end up missing.There was a lot of time and effort put into them. A lot of work and it would bea shame to have it all disappear.”28 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach9fn_327]When asked whether Max considered the threat to the notebooks to be coming fromthe Whittemores or somebody else at the WPI, Max made it clear that heconsidered the Whittemores to be the threat.29[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach9fn_328]Max also was insistent that Harvey Whittemore had written both of Max’saffidavits,30 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach9fn_329] an assertion that raisessignificant conflict of interest questions for a member of the legal professionlike Harvey. Was Harvey acting as an attorney for Max? If so, an attorney is notsupposed to act in a legal capacity in those situations in which he has apersonal interest, just as a surgeon is not supposed to operate on a familymember.Max’s exact words recorded in a telephone interview on March 13, 2014 were,“Both affidavits were written up by Harvey.”31[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach9fn_330] If Max’s recollection is accurate and Harveydid assist in the writing of Max’s affidavits, it’s difficult to imagine how oneanswers the claim that these actions by Harvey were not a conflict of interest.These affidavits would be a critical piece of evidence in the decision by theNevada District Attorney to file a warrant to search the home of Mikovits.The role of Harvey Whittemore in the management of the WPI has also been a topicof some controversy. In an affidavit filed on November 7, 2011, Harvey describedhis role:“I am an attorney and an unpaid advisor to the Whittemore Peterson Institute forNeuro-Immune Disease (“WPI” or “the Institute), a nonprofit research institutelocated on the campus of the University of Nevada in Reno with a research team,clinical laboratory, and patient medical clinic devoted to serving people withneuro-immune disease (“NID”). I work closely with the researchers and otheremployees at WPI. I am also married to Annette Whittemore, the founder ofWPI.”32 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach9fn_331]This view of Harvey’s role at the WPI was further described by Dr. FrankRuscetti in a declaration he executed on May 17, 2012. Ruscetti wrote:“I have had many conversations with Mr. Whittemore and have exchanged emailswith him, in which he spoke on behalf of WPI in a managerial or executivecapacity. For example, Mr. Whittemore wrote and edited scientific correspondenceon behalf of WPI. Exhibit 1 is a May 20, 2011 email exchange between me and Mr.Whittemore about “his suggestion for the cytokine paper response”. I alsodiscussed Mr. Whittemore’s examination of WPI’s scientific data with him beforeWPI submitted the data to various recipients. Mr. Whittemore was also presentwith me at WPI’s scientific meetings . . . I have participated in conferencecalls with Annette and Harvey Whittemore, in which Mr. Whittemore spoke onbehalf of WPI about this lawsuit. Mrs. Whittemore never once said that herhusband was not authorized to make the statements he made.”33[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach9fn_332]Max explained his view of the situation and what he thought Harvey was trying toaccomplish with his affidavit. “I didn’t understand what they were doing was aPR move, plastering them on the internet, trying to make it look like Judy wasup to no good. And they were doing that to save face with the patients. Ithought it was like I go to court and say what happened. That’s what I thoughtthe deal was with the affidavits. Like I’m attesting this is the information Iwas giving. I tried to go over it with them, and I’m like, you’re making itsound like I’m stealing stuff. And that was not my intention, to go in therestealing. That’s my research. I paid for my notebooks. They didn’t pay for thenotebooks of mine.”34 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach9fn_333]In summation, Max said, “So I went in there, and every time he [Harvey]word-smithed it to make it look like I was stealing. And as a result, that’shurt my career, labeling me as a thief, and that’s not cool. So now myunderstanding is that the affidavits are no good. I’m not exactly made of moneyand very quickly I was fighting a legal battle that has nothing to do withwhether you’re right or wrong, but how much money or power you have. So therewas no way I could handle that.”35 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach9fn_334]Max later spent time talking to one of the attorneys for Mikovits, Dennis Jones.He was happy to answer questions, but didn’t feel comfortable signing anaffidavit because of what he had already experienced.36[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach9fn_335]When asked how he felt about the chain of events and what he might have donedifferent, Max said, “I would still continue with what I did, but I would havemade a copy of them. I didn’t want to fork over the money to copy all of thosenotebooks, go to Kinkos, because that was like twenty notebooks of 100 pages. Iwas a little bit cheap there and didn’t want to do that. I figured I’d leaveJudy to do that.”On November 4, 2011, the WPI filed a complaint against Mikovits saying she hadtaken documents, computers, and flash drives that did not belong to her.Mikovits officially replied through a lawyer that she had done no such thing.But the legal onslaught continued when on November 9, 2011, a temporaryrestraining order and a civil lawsuit and were left on her front step, eschewingthe normal procedure for how one is legally served. On November 13, 2011, shereturned home after a weekend away on a boat with friends and found it there.This prompted a flurry of texts between Max and Mikovits about what this mightmean to the WPI’s participation in the Lipkin study. Mikovits thought thelawsuit was making Lipkin skittish about the study but felt she could workthings out.On November 15, 2011, Mikovits texted Max that he should feel free to call herattorney if he had any concerns. Max did not reply.She texted him again on November 17, 2011, but there was no reply.It was only later that Mikovits would learn that on November 16, 2011, Max hadapproached Harvey and asked if he could hold his gun for him. Mikovits wouldcome to believe this was when Harvey first learned the notebooks had not beensecured by his associates, prompting the mad dash which would lead a few dayslater to the search of her house and false arrest.On November 18, 2011, a combined posse of University of Nevada/Reno campussecurity and Ventura County sheriffs descended on her house, arrested her forsupposedly being a ”fugitive of justice,” booked her and put her in jail, allwithout a warrant. This and later events would seem to bear out her fears thatsomebody, or some group of people, never wanted her or the public to see thecontents of those crucial notebooks again.Mikovits did not see the original version of the WPI lawsuit until March 2014,and it was then when she saw it contained only the affidavits of HarveyWhittemore, Annette Whittemore, and Vincent Lombardi. Surprisingly there was noaffidavit from Max Pfost, the one affidavit that was supposed to containevidence that Mikovits had actually taken the notebooks.However, Harvey Whittemore’s affidavit was of special interest, as it clearlyshowed his close association with the WPI as well as seemingly corroborated thesuspicions Mikovits had that the entire thing had been a set up to frame her andthus keep her quiet regarding the wrongdoing of others. In his affidavit,Whittemore makes clear that he knew exactly in which drawers Mikovits kept thekey notebooks, the specific notebooks that would have revealed any errors andindiscretions made by anyone in her program regarding the XMRV study andcontroversy. So if one wanted to cover up those errors or indiscretions theywould first have to acquire those specific notebooks. Whittemore said in hisaffidavit:The last time I was alone with Dr. Mikovits in her office prior to her September29, 2011 termination, she showed me the locked drawer on the left hand side ofher desk where she kept the Mikovits Notebooks and the notebooks of otherresearchers. On that day, Dr. Mikovits told me that the laboratory notebooks ofresearchers Pfost, Puccinelli, and Hagen were in her possession and in a lockeddesk drawer. I observed Mikovits unlocking her desk and pulling out a notebookprepared and used by Ms. Hagen (the “Hagen notebook.)” Dr. Mikovits specificallyreferred me to particular dated references to laboratory activities in the Hagennotebook.”37 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach9fn_336]It was the Hagen notebook in which Mikovits had seen potential problems relatedto the work of Katy Hagen, conducted at the direction of Dr. Lombardi, withoutMikovits’s approval or knowledge.Additionally, it was interesting to note that the WPI lawsuit said Mikovits hadsigned and then breached a contract which stated she would turn in to WPI allcopies of all data generated from her. In fact the lawsuit said this supposedcontract included anything she had ever written down, regardless of if it wasduring working hours or not, onsite or not. However, this contract in fact neverexisted, and when Mikovits later saw it she recognized that the signature pagewas from another document, now attached to this fabricated contract.* * *Around seven-thirty that night Mikovits was lying on her bunk. She kept thinkingabout the question Tom Adams had asked and now another theory crept in. Couldthe notebooks be packed inside those two boxes of sheets and towels, soinconspicuous that they had gone unnoticed? She knew she’d have some free timelater that evening and could call David.But she’d have to speak in code since the phone lines were monitored. The bailhearing was set for the next day and there was a good chance that a rationalargument might finally prevail. She would ask David, “Honey, would you check thelinen closet and the Carol Roman (her friend from New York) bag, because Ireally need some clean clothes tomorrow when I get out of jail?” Would that beenough to make him open up those two boxes?She was mulling over a strategy when a call came into the cell. “Mikovits, youhave a pastoral visit.”When she looked perplexed he asked, “Didn’t you ask for a service?”Among the slew of questions at her booking, the only religious question sherecalled was whether she’d like a Bible during her time at the facility. Shesaid yes, but they never provided a Bible. Mikovits didn’t really know what tosay, but without a beat replied, “Yes, that’s me.” She wasn’t going to miss achance to leave her cell.That seemed to placate the guard, who then asked generously if she thought therewas anybody else who might like to attend the service. Mikovits named as manypeople in the cell-block as she could remember and the staff retrieved them.Eventually they gathered a sizeable number, about thirty women. The guards ledthe group to a small room where a Catholic priest in a dark robe and whitecollar and what seemed to be a few lay ministers were setting up for a Catholicmass.The priest, a husky older man with fine white hair, strolled over. Physicallythe priest reminded her of Derek Enlander, the doctor and researcher at Mt.Sinai Hospital in New York she’d been planning to see before she’d beenarrested. “You’re Judy Mikovits, aren’t you?” he asked.Mikovits couldn’t get over how much the priest resembled Enlander. At this verymoment she should have been sitting with Enlander in New York, but yet here shewas with what seemed to be his costumed double, dressed in a black robe andwhite collar.She was so dumbfounded she took a minute to answer. The other members of thepriest’s group, mostly women of about her age, hovered around and took greatinterest in whether or not she was Mikovits. “Yes, I’m Judy Mikovits,” shefinally said, feeling conspicuous.“Then we’re in the right place,” he replied with a twinkle in his eye.The other group members gave her warm smiles then went back to setting up.The inmates were told to find a seat. One of the lay ministers motioned forMikovits to take a place at the front of the room, which she reluctantly did.She still felt confused as to why they were singling her out.The opening passage was a tale of jealousy, betrayal, and justice from the Bookof Daniel, the account of Daniel being thrown into a lion’s den. Mikovitsremembered the historical context of how a Jewish man had found himself at thecourt of the Persian emperor. Jerusalem had been sacked years earlier by anotherPersian king and a number of Israelites were taken prisoner in what was referredto as the “Babylonian captivity.” Daniel was hand-picked to receive specialtraining as a court servant, which attracted the favorable notice of KingDarius.From Daniel, chapter 6, 1–3.Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because anexcellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the wholerealm.What were the chances of the two men she was supposed to be spending this Mondaynight with, one a researcher in New York, and the other a priest visiting a jailin southern California, looking so alike? The question of this serendipity keptintruding her thoughts. Had God reached into her prison cell to let her know shewas not forgotten?The priest recounted how favoritism shown by the Persian king towards Daviddidn’t sit well with the other princes and members of the court. Knowing Danielwas an observant Jew who according to the dictates of his faith, prayed threetimes every day in the direction of Jerusalem, they concocted a hateful plan.They maneuvered Darius into signing a decree, which forbid citizens from askingany requests of God or any man other than the king for a period of thirty days.Failure to follow this decree would result in a defiant person being thrown intoa den of lions. Daniel continued to pray three times every day in the directionof Jerusalem. He was seized by his enemies who brought him before the king.Darius was distraught over the arrest of his loyal appointee, but it was his owndecree and he had to follow it.Mikovits could not help but reflect that even after thousands of years, whenpowerful people wanted to do evil deeds they still followed the same playbook:twist the law to make a virtuous person into a criminal.In the morning, King Darius arrived at the lion’s den to ask if Daniel’s god hadprotected him. Daniel loudly declared:My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions’ mouths, that they have nothurt me; forasmuch as before him innocence was found in me; and also beforethee, O king, have I done no hurt.Daniel was removed, found uninjured because of his righteousness, and the tablesthen turned:And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel, andthey cast them into the den of lions.The harsh Old Testament justice of the story made Mikovits chuckle to herself.Even if unjustly imprisoned, she certainly did not want her friends-turned-foesdevoured by lions.The priest gave his homily, stressing the need for people to act withconscience, even if they may be attacked. They must hold tight to faith that ifthey do the right thing, God will protect them. Those words felt personallydirected, resonating deeply with Mikovits.At communion time, most of the thirty women got up to receive the sacrament.Mikovits had grown up in the Catholic Church and thus knew one is not supposedto take communion until given confession or unless one’s soul is free from sin.She had switched from Catholicism to a Protestant denomination prior to marryingDavid so it had been more than a decade since her last confession. The pastorfor the facility noticed she was not taking the sacrament and walked over.“You’re not Catholic?” she queried.“No, not lately. I’m a devout Christian, but I’m a Presbyterian.”The pastor was confused. “We got an email from Ireland that said it wasimperative we have a Catholic mass for you because you’re a devout Catholic andthis was very important to you.”The Irish ME/CFS patients must have set this up. Mikovits was touched by theirefforts to comfort her in this darkest hour. “Well, that’s okay,” she smiled. “Istill appreciate it very much.” Mikovits thought of the hurley stick and itsinscription.Tiocfaidh ar la.Our day will come."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TENThe Autism Question“You don’t talk about autism in the US—it’s too politically charged,” Mikovitsclaims Coffin told him. She believes Coffin turned against her that very day.Coffin confirms he was upset that Lombardi presented such preliminary data onsuch a fraught topic but says, “I did not ‘turn against’ Judy at that or anyother point.”—Jon Cohen and Martin Enserink, “False Positive,” Science1[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach10fn_337]On October 14, 2009, Mikovits and Annette Whittemore surprised the ME/CFScommunity when they appeared on a show called Nevada Newsmakers and introducedthe compelling possibility on air that there was a connection between not justXMRV and ME/CFS, but also autism.2 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach10fn_338]The WPI had been interested in both autism and Gulf War Syndrome as apparentneuroimmune diseases. Mikovits believed that autism involved a dysregulation ofthe immune and nervous systems. Despite the dissent of one of the WPI advisors,Mikovits kept pursuing the idea. She then chanced upon a pertinent article fromthe Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology at the University ofCalifornia at Davis.A study overseen by Dr. Judy Van de Water of the M.I.N.D. Institute (MedicalInvestigation of Neurodevelopmental Disorders) investigated one of Mikovits’sprime subjects, natural killer cells. The title of her paper, “Altered GeneExpression and Function of Peripheral Blood Natural Killer Cells in Childrenwith Autism,”3 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach10fn_339] jumped out to Mikovits likea lighted billboard on a quiet road, flashing the message, “Autoimmune problem!Check for viruses and other pathogens!”Natural killer cells (NK) are white blood cells with a vital role in killingtumor and virally infected cells, and they were thought to be centrally involvedin early cases in ME/CFS, as measured in by researchers at the NCI in a papercoauthored by Cheney and Peterson in 1987.4[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach10fn_340]5 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach10fn_341] Thekiller cell maneuvers itself into close proximity to a cell that it hasidentified as being cancerous or virally infected, and then releases specialproteins such as perforin and proteases known as granzymes. The perforin openspores in the cell membrane (“perforating” it) and this allows the granzymes toenter. The granzymes then induce apoptosis (cell suicide), destroying the cellwithout releasing infectious viral particles, or virions.A body fighting off cancer or viruses desperately needs its natural killer cellsto function properly. Some scientists have suggested that natural killer cellshave other indispensable purposes like modulating the immune system.Van de Water found significant differences in natural killer cell functionbetween normal children and those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). As shestated:“This present study shows distinct and significant physiological differences inNK cell responses in children with ASD . . . An altered NK cell population mayhave several consequences which could impact upon immune function in ASD andcould explain some of the immune findings previously observed in ASD.6[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach10fn_342]This work by Van de Water clearly revealed that mainstream researchers wereinvestigating autism as a potential neuroimmune disorder, very much in line withthe central mission statement of the WPI.The UC Davis group had found abnormal autoantibodies in the mothers of childrenwith autism, specifically a 37 kilo-dalton protein that they could notidentify,7 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach10fn_343] as well as autoantibodies in thesystems of the children. Autoantibodies were already on Mikovits’s radar. Thisexpression “autoantibody” comes from the Greek words, “auto” meaning “self,”“anti” meaning “against,” and body, the self turning internally against itself.The immune system manufactures a protein directed against one or more of aperson’s own proteins. Some autoantibody production is thought to be due to acombination of genetics and environmental triggers, such as a viral illness orexposure to certain toxic chemicals.Mikovits and Peterson thought that a protein of 37,000 molecular weight the UCDavis researchers had discovered might be directed against a part of the RNase Lenzyme, indicating another weakness in the body’s antiviral defense system. Theenzyme was likely amorphous and broken, and the body had decided these fragmentswere invaders and that it should mount a defense. What could have possiblytriggered such a breakdown in the RNase L enzyme?It could be caused by viral or bacterial infection, but chemical orenvironmental exposures were also possible. As Van de Water later wrote in anarticle entitled, “Autoantibodies to Cerebellum in Children with AutismAssociated with Behavior”:“Collectively, these data suggest that autoantibodies towards brain proteins inchildren are associated with lower adaptive and cognitive function as well ascore behaviors associated with autism. It is unclear whether these antibodieshave direct pathogenic significance, or if they are merely a response to aprevious injury. Future studies are needed to determine the identities of theprotein targets and explore their significance in autism.”8[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach10fn_344]Mikovits and Peterson traveled to visit Van de Water and others at the M.I.N.D.Institute to discuss these intriguing findings. At the time, Mikovits’s teamwasn’t as focused on retroviruses, but rather on general patterns of immunesystem regulation suggested by the research. Overall immune dysregulation mightexplain the pathogens associated with neuroimmune disorders, such as HHV-6 orthe Epstein-Barr virus, argued as both causal and passenger viruses in ME/CFS.If a retrovirus was at the heart of various neuroimmune problems, the situationcould be one of a retroviral “driver” and other “passengers,” the way theKaposi’s Sarcoma herpes virus (KSHV or HHV8) was a “passenger” in AIDSpatients.9 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach10fn_345] While the herpes virus does nottechnically cause Kaposi sarcoma (a type of cancer) in healthy patients, the HIVretrovirus knocks out a part of the immune system, which allows for KS toreactivate.The M.I.N.D. Institute meetings were fruitful and it became clear to Mikovitsthat Van De Water, her staff, and the head of the M.I.N.D. Institute, DavidAmaral, were interested in further research.10[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach10fn_346] Specifically, they wanted to examine thenatural killer cell defect and were intrigued by the possibility that the 37kilo-dalton protein might be an antibody directed against a broken fragment ofthe RNase L enzyme.After an ongoing back-and-forth via telephone, Annette, Mikovits and Petersoneven donned formal clothes and drove down to Davis, CA, for the M.I.N.D.Institute Ball in September of 2008. The three of them were disappointed to findthe ball wasn’t raising funds for the biological investigations of Van De Waterand other researchers, but for behavior modification.“They just want to build a better wheelchair,” said Annette. Annette had oftenused this expression to describe useless research into ME/CFS that had seeminglygiven up on being curative. Annette wanted to spearhead a dramatic change forthese patients, not only make tiny improvements in their quality of life.* * *One of the first pediatric cases the WPI investigated involved a family with twokids who suffered from a genetic mutation-associated disease called Niemann PickType C, often referred to as a kind of childhood Alzheimers disease due toprogressive deterioration of the brain and organs caused by a build-up oflipids, which results in dementia, seizures, tremors, and other progressivesymptoms.11 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach10fn_347]While both parents tested negative for any active XMRV virus, they testedpositive for the antibody to the envelope of XMRV. The children also testedpositive for XMRV envelope protein. The “envelope” of a virus is often used as ameans of detecting the virus, although this line of testing can be imprecisebecause related viruses can react to the detecting reagent (ie, the antibody toSFFV envelope detects all members of the xenotropic murine leukemia virusesincluding XMRV.) If a virus is wearing a different envelope protein, like asuspect in a borrowed coat and hat, identification may be confusing.Mikovits and her team also found compelling overlap with other disorders. Ofthree patients they tested with atypical multiple sclerosis, all three werepositive for antibody to XMRV envelope protein and gag DNA, (partial sequence ofa structural protein of the virus).Twelve out of twenty patients (60 percent) with fibromyalgia were also positivefor XMRV gag DNA.The autism cohort was the largest non-ME/CFS group they investigated and theresults varied depending on which test was used. Twelve out of thirty childrenwith autism were positive for XMRV gag DNA, or 40 percent positive. Twenty-threeout of thirty (76 percent) were positive for XMRV envelope by Western blot.Sixteen out of twenty-eight (57 percent) were positive for serum antibody to theXMRV envelope. Depending on the test used, the autism kids showed some XMRVviral evidence from a low of 40 percent to a high of 76 percent.As they were working on more than three hundred samples from ME/CFS patients,the other disorders they were investigating were more marginal interests, yetnotable given the shocking data versus controls.Another paper done earlier by Dr. Paul Levine and his colleagues informed muchof Mikovits’s thinking. Levine had worked at the NCI at the same time asMikovits, but they never interacted until she arrived at the WPI. Levine’s studylooked at several generations in a family in which one of the members hadME/CFS, and delved deeply into the question of the natural killer cell activityof specific individuals. Levine found, remarkably, that the NK cell activitylevel correlated with the overall severity of disease.12[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach10fn_348]Mikovits extrapolated from Levine’s work that if a person’s natural killer cellactivity was normal, no disease would be present. If the NK cell activity wasaround 50 percent, indications of subclinical disease would appear. NK cellactivity of less than 50 percent meant that in all likelihood the person had achronic illness.As Mikovits, Ruscetti, Silverman, and Lombardi began to develop and researchtheir idea of a retrovirus at the heart of ME/CFS, the illness no longer lookedlike a “catchall” but more like a cellular diaspora—with everything fanning outfrom the central element of retroviral infection and NK cell problems. If aperson’s NK cells functioned normally, the retrovirus would stay suppressed.This pattern was also observed in HTLV-1, the retrovirus found mainly in Asiancountries that caused leukemia or HTLV-associated myelopathy in about 5 percentof the patients who carried it.Retroviruses didn’t have to be as fast and furious as HIV, directing a persontoward certain death if left untreated. But such drama tended to grip publicattention.Although people liked to focus on vicious-seeming viruses like Ebola, thosedidn’t actually present a long-term threat. Their very lethality meant that theywould burn quickly through a population, killing swaths of people but eventuallyextinguishing themselves. HIV had been a cataclysmic scenario, showing that aretrovirus could coexist with its victims for many years, eluding the attentionof the immune system, and yet still result in lethal chronic diseases. Mikovitsthought of the admonition by famed scientist James Lovelock: an inefficientvirus kills its host. A clever virus stays with it. HIV was not just a “driver”but a hijacker.If a retrovirus was at the heart of ME/CFS and autism, it seemed to lower immunefunctions of the patient enough to allow the proliferation of other pathogens,but not completely sabotage immunity to cause imminent death, dialing downfunctionality just enough so the pathogen could survive, but making the dailylife of the host much more difficult.Those with the virus suffered greatly, but since the medical profession couldn’tget a clear read on the problem because of conflicting signals from otherpathogens and biomarkers, as well as the baffling array of symptoms, patientswere disbelieved or ignored.The patients had to linger in their own private hell with this “clever virus”directing the course of their lives.* * *Mikovits and Frank and Sandy Ruscetti first presented their evidence to thefederal government that a retrovirus might underlie many childhoodneurodevelopmental disorders in early September 2009 at the NCI.13[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach10fn_349]Besides the detailed July 22 meeting, two other special XMRV conferenceshappened that involved Mikovits and the public health community prior to thepublication of their article in the journal Science on October 8, 2009. Eachmeeting gave public health authorities time to review the work and identify anyweaknesses in the original data or concerns they might have had about theresearch conclusions, before to the publication of any data.The level of caution seemed failsafe.Frank Ruscetti, as a government employee, was slated to present the data on thetwo children with Niemann-Pick Type C disorder. When the two children’s resultsfor natural killer cells and antibodies were matched against the results fromME/CFS patients, they looked remarkably similar. Frank also presented evidencefrom several children with autism, showing abnormal gag sequences from viralproteins thought to be associated with XMRV, as well as data showing that thechildrens’ plasma could transmit what appeared to be a retrovirus into LNCaPcell line. He included data from the family members, showing an apparentfamilial pattern of both immune system abnormalities and neuroimmune disorders.What impressed Mikovits the most about the September meeting was how seriouslythe public health establishment responded to this information.14[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach10fn_350] A number of researchers from the NCI hadattended. John Coffin was there as well as a smattering of careerretrovirologists. Also in attendance at the meeting was an HIV researcher andantiretroviral drug specialist who had once worked with Mikovits. XMRV and theapparently-associated diseases created a loud rallying cry in the researchcommunity, convening great minds and significant forces to combat it.In that air of optimism, Annette Whittemore also had a visible agenda. Sheproposed to the scientists in charge of the research funding to the extramuralcommunity at the NCI and the National Institute of Allergy and InfectiousDisease NIAID (the institute in charge of overseeing infectious diseaseresearch) that the WPI be made a center of excellence and secure separatefunding to study these diseases. While the attendees seemed to comprehend that atimely reaction to the growing epidemic was imperative, they emphasized thatthere were channels to go through to secure research funding and resented, likemost bureaucrats, a nonscientist attempting to circumvent the process.Annette Whittemore hit a wall with a senior grants administrator of the NationalInstitute of Allergy and Infectious Dieseases (NIAID) that was directed by Dr.Anthony Fauci. Fauci was a notorious foe-turned-friend to many people with AIDSin the early years of the pandemic, when his later-friend Larry Kramer (thewell-known activist and writer with AIDS) called him a murderer.15[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach10fn_351]Fauci had his own critics in the ME/CFS community, especially over his 2002decision to move research for ME/CFS from the National Institutes of Health tothe Office of Research on Women’s Health16 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach10fn_352].One activist wrote of the decision, “A major concern of CFS sufferers has beenthe tendency of society to quickly classify emerging illnesses whichpredominantly affect women as psychiatric, stress-related, behavioral, oremotional dysfunction.”17 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach10fn_353]Mikovits felt that the senior grants administrator spoke in a seeminglycondescending tone when she explained that Annette didn’t understand how theAmerican research culture worked.18 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach10fn_354]The National Institutes of Health would put out a call for proposals.It would then take about three or four years for the proposals to come back fromthe various researchers in the field and institutions.After such time, the medical intelligentsia would decide which submissionsshould be recommended to the appropriate research agencies.From the picture presented by the senior grants administrator, it appeared thefederal government would jump right on this potential public health crisis inabout five years.This meeting, in addition to some of the early critical response to the Sciencepaper, drove Annette and Mikovits to make a brash move by appearing on theNevada Newsmakers show.* * *Nevada Newsmakers opened with punchy music, colorful graphics, and the announcerpromising a “No-holds-barred political forum!”Host Sam Shad spoke in a soothing voice as he began. “I can’t think of a moreexciting program I’ve done because what we’re about to talk about isworld-shattering news.”19 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach10fn_355] Shad recountedthe recent publication of the Science article and the association between anewly discovered retrovirus, XMRV, and patients with ME/CFS.Mikovits began in the confident tones of a professional who had spent decades inmedical research.“There are only two other human retroviruses known—human T-cell leukemia virusand HIV, the retrovirus that causes AIDS. Both of these viruses cause cancers,neurological disorders, and inflammatory diseases in man.”20[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach10fn_356]Shad asked what had prompted them to look for this retrovirus in patients withME/CFS, when it had previously only been reported in men with prostate cancer: aseeming leap. Mikovits noted that the hereditary prostate cancer gene #1 (HPC-1)coded for an antiviral enzyme RNase L, and that this enzyme was also deficientin patients with ME/CFS.The host solicited Annette Whittemore’s thoughts when the research veered downthis unexpected path. Annette replied:“I knew the one thing we had to do was look for answers. And I believed allalong we were going to find an underlying pathogen. It didn’t make sense that somany different viruses had been claimed to cause this disorder. I was absolutelythrilled. This is exactly what we started out to do.”21[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach10fn_357]Then Shad broached a hot button issue, addressing the oft-mistreatment of ME/CFSin the medical community. Annette fielded the question.“The exciting thing is that Judy can tell you how the virus works and every oneof those symptoms makes sense. It’s wonderful to be able to have thispuzzle—just all the pieces come together and fit so well.”Mikovits also launched into the science:“It’s a simple retrovirus, which means its expression, the on or off switch, iscontrolled by just—and we’ve learned this—it’s unpublished data, by just threethings. The response to hormones and the response to inflammatory cytokines.It’s called NF Kappa B element. Cortisol, which is the stress hormone, turns onthe virus very rapidly, and continues to have it expressed. So do inflammatoryevents as caused by other pathogens. And so do hormones like androgens andprogesterone, which also make sense with regard to prostate cancer.”22[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach10fn_358]Shad then asked trenchantly: how could the retrovirus be transmitted? Annettereplied the other two known human retroviruses were unable to become airborneand were transmitted through blood and other bodily fluids. Then theconversation turned into interesting territory.* * *Shad observed that the station had been vigorous supporters of the autismcommunity and asked how this research might affect autism.Mikovits replied. “It’s not in the paper and it’s not reported,” she said, “butwe’ve actually done some of these studies and found the virus present in anumber, a significant number, of autistic samples that we’ve tested so far.”Shad said the news had tremendous potential for parents looking for treatmentsor cures for their autistic children. Mikovits replied by saying that XMRV:“might be linked to a number of neuro-immune diseases, including autism. Itcertainly won’t be all, because there are genetic defects that result in autism,but there are also the environmental effects.”Then with barely taking a breath she crossed the Rubicon.“There’s always the hypothesis that my child was fine, then they got sick, andthen they got autism. Interestingly, on that note, if I might speculate a littlebit. This might explain why vaccines lead to autism in some children becausethese viruses live and divide and grow in the lymphocytes, the immune responsecells, the B and T cells. So when you give a vaccine you send your B and T cellsinto overdrive. That’s its job.Well, if you’re harboring one virus, and you replicate it a whole bunch, you’venow broken the balance between the immune response and the virus. So you couldhave had the underlying virus and then amplified it with the vaccine and thenset off the disease, such that your immune system could no longer control theinfections and create an immune deficiency.”23[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach10fn_359]The segment broke for commercial.* * *After break, Shad announced that Annette and Mikovits wanted to clear up anissue about vaccines. Annette spoke up:“I just wanted to say that we are certainly advocating vaccinations andunderstand how important they are to the well-being of the children. But whatwe’re hoping for is by finding out whether or not somebody is positive for XMRV,whether it’s one family member or another, and then looking for it in children,you could alter the immune response in such a way that you can protect the childand still be able to vaccinate, and avoid autism in these kids.And again, I don’t think either one of us are sitting here and sayingvaccinations cause autism, rather a number of factors—the genetic susceptibilityto the illness, the infection itself, and then on top of that you’re addingsomething to that mix that takes the child over the top.”24[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach10fn_360]Shad then jumped to the hopeful topic of drug treatments, stating that HIV/AIDSwas once a death sentence that was overturned once current treatments allowedpeople with HIV/AIDS to live long and healthy lives. Mikovits quicklyinterjected that there were existing FDA approved drugs that might also beeffective in combating the XMRV retrovirus and believed the time was right tobegin “rational clinical trials.”Shad said this was going to be an exciting global breakthrough, and he wasthrilled by the potential as he had a family member with the excruciating nervepain of fibromyalgia. Annette added that they had been studying fibromyalgia andfound those patients were also testing positive for XMRV in high numbers.The segment ended.* * *On November 9–10, 2009, Silverman hosted a workshop on XMRV at the prestigiousCleveland Clinic.25 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach10fn_361] It was the firstworkshop on XMRV at the facility internationally-renowned for its innovative,forward-thinking approaches and therapies.In an air of levity and sportsmanship, he even had black baseball caps with XMRVemblazoned across the front made for the attendees. Silverman had been one ofthe lead researchers on the team that first discovered pieces of the retrovirusin prostate cancer tissue and the Cleveland Clinic could reasonably lay claim toa fair share of the credit for the discovery of XMRV in ME/CFS, even thoughothers like Joseph DeRisi had contributed with the use of his ViroChipdiagnostic test.Silverman and Lombardi had been professional pals since that meeting theprevious year at the Michael Milken Prostate Cancer event when they hiked theSierra Nevadas. Mikovits considered it a positive sign that even though theirwork had cast considerable doubt on Silverman’s assertion of a link between aspecific genetic variation in the RNase L gene and infection with the XMRVretrovirus, it had not damaged their collegial relationship.The association between a defect in the RNase L antiviral enzyme and XMRVinfection in ME/CFS was still very robust. They simply hadn’t identified thegenetic variation, which was responsible for the defect in the enzyme. Maybe itwasn’t even a problem that could be blamed on genetics.Despite some unanswered questions, Silverman invited Lombardi to give apresentation on the RNase L research and the immunology in XMRV-infected ME/CFSpatients. He also asked Mikovits to present on the virology in the Science paperand she prepared both of their talks. At the conference, she and Lombardi met upwith Sandy Ruscetti, who had coauthored the paper. Mikovits felt confident thatLombardi would expound on his research well, and she was excited for the youngpostdoctoral fellow presenting data from his first publication.But Mikovits came down with severe laryngitis the day they arrived and couldn’ttalk above a whisper. So the night before her own presentation, Mikovitsreviewed it slide by slide with Lombardi, explaining what to say about each, thetransitions, and the questions he might be asked. Frank Ruscetti had contributedessentially all of the virology in the paper and Lombardi the immunology.In retrospect, instead of simply naming Frank Ruscetti co-first author, the teamprobably should have revisited the decision to name Lombardi as a first authoron the Science paper after Dean and Gould found that there was no associationbetween the RNase L genetic variation and infection with the XMRV retrovirus.But Mikovits had been in the middle of credit disputes before and didn’t havethe stomach for them.In her mind, once the decision had been made around authorship, it was settled.* * *John Coffin presided over the event from the stage, sitting behind the tablewith his arms folded, his wild white hair and thick beard framing his face.Mikovits sat in the front of the audience, her throat still raw from laryngitis,a rare transient mutism for the woman nicknamed “tsunami Judy” by her friendsfor the torrent of words that poured out when she had a pressing thought.26[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach10fn_362]In his fifteen minute presentation, Lombardi seemed to have little understandingof the virology. He stumbled over the slides and scrambled importantinformation. It was a disaster. Mikovits sat tensely in the audience, trying tohold herself back.The presentation also included a slide on the children with Niemann-PickSyndrome. Including data on children had been a strategic decision. BecauseME/CFS sufferers were mostly women, disbelievers and deniers could easily buildon a long history of supposed female hysteria.It was one thing, Mikovits and Ruscetti reasoned, to ignore sick women, but whowould stomp on sick children?During the question and answer session, an audience member noted that Lombardihad mentioned vaccines, and asked if these kids had started falling apart aftera vaccination. Mikovits thought she had been abundantly clear with Lombardiabout answering this question.Although she did not fully understand how starkly the lines were drawn on thequestion of vaccines, she labored to develop an answer that would acknowledgethe importance of vaccines to public health, while at the same time beingconsistent with the existing evidence that among some children those samevaccines could cause enormous damage.She had instructed Lombardi to say that they might be dealing with some childrenwho have an inborn genetic defect, which would make it difficult, if notimpossible for them to respond to the immune challenge of a vaccine.Lombardi needed to be clear that they were not talking about any fear that XMRVmight be contained in a vaccine or that anything was wrong with the vaccine. Thehypothesis he was supposed to advance was that if these children were harboringa retrovirus, possibly as a result of a genetic defect in their antiviraldefense system, the retrovirus would most likely be hiding in the B and T cellsof their immune system.The intended effect of a vaccination is to expand the B and T cells of aperson’s immune system to fight the weakened or killed virus, thus creatingantibodies that can protect a person in the event of an actual infection.But in the case of a child who had the retrovirus in their B and T cells, thevery immune activation that was supposed to confer immunity for one virus wouldend up causing this newly discovered retrovirus to replicate. It would look to aparent like they took their healthy child in for a vaccination and afterwardstheir child started to develop problems. There was also the very realpossibility that as a child’s immune system developed, it would control theretrovirus on its own, and the developmental or neurological problems mightnever occur.The vaccine could be the trigger that tipped the child into immune andneurological problems, but there were other issues. In other words, the argumenthad a lot of nuances.But Lombardi gave a pat answer: yes, these children began falling apart after avaccination. He began to fully explain the hypothesis, but was cut off byhostility from the rear of the room. “You can’t say anything about autism!” oneresearcher shouted from the back.“Why are you talking about vaccines?” yelled another.Lombardi responded, “I didn’t say it was in the vaccines, I said the vaccineswere stimulating the very cells which might be harboring the retrovirus.”Mikovits could see Coffin, now on his feet, glaring at Lombardi.27[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach10fn_363] Somebody yelled, “Are you saying theseretroviruses are in the vaccines?”Lombardi tried to settle the fracas. Researchers typically did not shout overeach other like Wall Street traders, but now they were doing just that.This just agitated the attendees. The audience members, particularly from theback, continued to shout. Mikovits tried to defend her collaborator, but herlaryngitis prevented her from speaking in anything louder than a whisper.Finally, Silverman calmed the crowd and Lombardi left the stage.Mikovits thought that Coffin’s eyes were staring daggers at the young postdoc.28[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach10fn_364]* * *A scientist present at the conference confirmed much of what Mikovits reported,but put a different spin on the controversy. It’s left to the reader todetermine whether this opinion reflects proper scientific humility in the faceof processes which are still unclear, or something which would have been foreignto scientists like Galileo or Darwin who chose to follow a hypothesis to itsconclusion, regardless of who it bothered.About Coffin, the scientist said, “I think he was just concerned. I think all ofus were concerned. We didn’t want anybody to get upset about something. Or thinkthat we had found the answer to something before it was really wellinvestigated. I’m trying to think of the right word. I think he was sensitive tothe fact that there’s been a lot of controversy about studies on ME/CFS andautism. And I think that’s part of the reason we still haven’t figured it out.There’s so much controversy and the scientists don’t want to get involved in thecontroversy and do the research. And it’s left to people who are maybe not thebest researchers to do it. But I think he was concerned, like don’t go there.”29[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach10fn_365]Indeed, “there” seemed to be a minefield when it came to autism and what role,if any, vaccines might play in the disorder.* * *Mikovits and Frank Ruscetti debriefed Lombardi’s discussion, as well as aseparate set of problems raised by Dr. Brigitte Huber, namely her inability todetect XMRV in a ME/CFS cohort.Huber had done some very preliminary work in a handful of ME/CFS samples, usingprimers and assays quite different from those used by Mikovits, and had beenunable to find XMRV: data she brought up pre-publication. Mikovits believed thepoor results were because Huber was focusing on Silverman’s sequences and PCRconditions, not starting with the spleen-focus forming virus assay which seemedto her to be the closest match to the new retrovirus. Mikovits also believedHuber was getting funding from the HHV-6 Foundation and often scientists willhave an unconscious bias against research which conflicts with their own. IfXMRV turned out to be a significant pathogen in the development of ME/CFS andautism, it would displace HHV-6 as a possible causal candidate.From an email Mikovits later sent to Silverman discussing what had happened atthe conference:. . . I am sorry that we were both sick and that Vinnie said some inappropriatethings, he is young and trying his best. That said, I am disappointed thatBrigette Huber was allowed to show very preliminary data and turn ourpresentation into a circus . . .30 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach10fn_366]Silverman responded by saying that he had declined Huber’s request to speak, butthen she talked to some other people who agreed to let her speak. Then he talkedabout the autism data.The autism data has rubbed a lot of people the wrong way since it is out thereon the internet without a peer-reviewed publication and uninformed people arejumping to conclusions . . .31 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach10fn_367]Mikovits thought it was a little strange to say that the data on autism, themost common childhood developmental disorder “rubbed a lot of the people thewrong way,” but she wanted to maintain the forward momentum. Shouldn’t this beexciting news?It concerned her that Huber had presented such preliminary data (alsounpublished) even after being told no by Silverman. Mikovits responded:We are going to get all of the autism off of the sites possible today and dodamage control as possible. The intent of the slide was as should have beenstated and I did last week say we found it in families. Vinnie missed thesubtleties and Frank had felt that these data needed to be presented toscientists as they do provide clues to transmission so that studies could startas soon as possible . . . point well taken . . . the slide has been “burned.”32[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach10fn_368]Even at this early stage, the outlines of a two-front war were starting to takeshape. The first front was on XMRV itself, and how Mikovits believed researcherswere choosing to ask a different question than she had done in the Sciencearticle. She had found something close to Silverman’s XMRV, and it might beexactly that, or it could be something closely related.They were hunting an elusive prey, a virus that might spend most of the timehiding in tissues, and not usually be present in the bloodstream. That was whyshe had taken multiple samples from the patients, looking for that time when thevirus could be detected in the blood. It wasn’t a one-look proposition. Thisfight would be very public.The second front, almost a secret war, the one thing nobody seemed to want totalk about, is what this might mean for those with autism. Mikovits would cometo believe that powerful forces were fighting on the first front so hard,because they didn’t want to reveal what this second front meant to a generationof children, and their own culpability.* * *After the Cleveland Clinic seminar, Mikovits phoned Frank Ruscetti to tell himwhat a disaster the conference had been.33 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach10fn_369]Frank tried to calm her down, telling her it couldn’t have been that bad, but hedidn’t convince her.When Mikovits returned to Nevada and met with Harvey and Annette Whittemore, shetold them that in order to protect Lombardi’s professional future, they wouldneed to remove him from the research. After the dust-up at the Cleveland Clinicshe’d heard murmurings that Lombardi would not get any other government grants.And Mikovits knew how clannish the research community could be.Lombardi hadn’t been working at the research lab much anyway; he spent most ofhis time in the clinical lab. Mikovits suggested that Lombardi could head up theclinical lab and work part-time in the research lab. If he could not getfunding, he could not teach students whose careers depended on academicreputation and grant support. Mikovits saw no other viable solution to keepLombardi safe. Lombardi would not be allowed to be an academic researchscientist, at least for several years.But Lombardi was still interested in doing research. He would work on her grantsas a co-investigator and continue to submit research grant proposals to thegovernment with the support of Mikovits and Ruscetti. None would be funded.If the presentation had been about a less charged scientific subject, Lombardimight not have received such hostile treatment. But in his first outing he hadgrabbed the third rail of western science, and Mikovits doubted that hercolleagues would forgive the heresy.* * *Harvey Whittemore made several phone calls urging Frank Ruscetti to meet withSenator Harry Reid to discuss the research and control the damage done byLombardi’s presentation.34 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach10fn_370] Despite hismisgivings (federal employees are not supposed to meet with congressionalrepresentatives unless they get approval), Ruscetti eventually accepted.After all, Reid, the Senate Majority leader, wanted to meet with him and surelyhad the authority to approve the meeting. Reid noticed Ruscetti’s Boston accent,asked about his background, how he got into science, his military service, andengaged in other basic small talk. Ruscetti did his best to remain charming andengaged. Eventually, Reid asked Ruscetti if he thought the research into XMRVwas important.Ruscetti believed Reid just wanted to know if Ruscetti thought if XMRV andME/CFS research was worthy of more research funding. The autism-vaccine questionnever came up. A photographer came in at one point to take a picture of SenatorReid, Ruscetti, and Harvey Whittemore. Harvey and Frank and then Annette andFrank posed behind the majority leader’s chair with gleaming grins.After the meeting, Harvey and Frank had lunch without Annette who had somepolitical meeting to attend. During lunch, Frank told Harvey not to sell adiagnostic kit for two reasons. First, the science paper needed to beindependently reproduced first, and second, even if it was right, theself-righteous scientific leaders would think it unseemly to make money directlyfrom an individual’s discovery.As far as vaccines and how they might contribute to the number one childhooddevelopmental disorder, neither the scientific nor political establishmentwanted to “go there.” ME/CFS was already well-branded, and the patients were byand large tucked away in rooms, but autism was far too much of a wild card.Trying to find answers for the millions of children with autism apparently“rubbed a lot of people the wrong way.” Given the lack of interest, and evenoutright hostility expressed by those at the Cleveland Clinic conference onXMRV, it’s difficult to understand what part of the “public health” thesescientists were interested in protecting."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ELEVENScience and SensibilityHere, we identified XMRV nucleic acids in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) of 68 of 101 (67%) of CFS patients, whereas only 8 of 218 (3.7%) ofregional, healthy controls contained XMRV DNA. Furthermore, infectious virus wastransmitted from activated PBMC as well from purified B and T cell cultures andplasma derived from CFS patients by establishing a secondary infection inuninfected primary lymphocytes and indicator cell lines.Full length sequencing revealed 99% homology with previously isolated strains ofXMRV. These results were supported by the observation of type C retrovirusparticles in patient PBMCs using transmission electron microscopy.Taken together, these data demonstrate the first direct isolation of infectiousXMRV from humans and implicate a role for XMRV infection in the pathogenesis ofCFS.—The original abstract of the Science, article, October, 8, 20091[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach11fn_371]Otto Von Bismarck once said, “No one should see how laws or sausages are made.”In this century, Bismark may have added scientific publications to that list.To Mikovits, publication in the top journal Science certainly involved sausagefactory antics, with some offcuts from her original article never reaching thepublic eye. To her, the decision over which passages were included in her team’spublished Science article called into question the stringency around protectingpublic health. She felt that the steps leading to the identification of a newretrovirus in ME/CFS patients were as important as the actual discovery, andshould be elucidated.People needed to know the why and the how to find out why these patients were sosick. So in the July 13, 2009, version of her team’s Science submission, whichthe referees approved for publication before some of it ended up on Science’scutting floor, her team detailed its rationale for seeking out the retrovirus inCFS:Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a multi-system disorder, manifested byinflammatory sequelae including innate immune activation, antiviral enzyme(RNase L) dysfunction and low natural killer cell numbers and function. Therecent discovery of the gammaretrovirus, XMRV, in men with familial prostatecancer harboring a reduced variant of RNase L prompted us to test the hypothesisthat XMRV might be associated with CFS.2 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach11fn_372]The RNase L commonality was a crucial part of why the team had gone hunting aretrovirus in ME/CFS, an initial linkage between seemingly disparate men withbad prostate exams, and fainéant-looking women wrinkling the paper of examtables while doctors dismissed them with lines like, “just try exercising more.”Given the melee that followed the Science publication, it is notable thatMikovits and her coauthors also did launch into a detailed description of theirsampling and testing methodology, as well as stressing their safeguards againstcontamination:To investigate possible routes of transmission, we next examined plasma fromheparinized blood that had been frozen in liquid nitrogen within one hour ofblood draw and shipped on dry ice to the NCI. To determine if infectious XMRVcould be detected in plasma, we employed a virus isolation spinning protocol,which had previously been shown to greatly enhance the ability of retrovirusesand Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpes virus, to infect different cell types invitro.After co-culture with plasma, the LNCaP cells were sub-cultured for 2–4passages. Both XMRV gp70 Env and p30 GAG were abundantly expressed in 10 out of12 plasmas (6 of which are shown in Fig. 4A).While the details about spinning protocols and liquid nitrogen may makenon-scientist eyes glaze, they are important because liquid nitrogen can nearlyfix something in time. The expedient freezing of samples in liquid nitrogen (arange between -346 and -320 degrees Fahrenheit) is known to preserve evidence ofretroviral activity that could otherwise quickly degrade.So if the samples in Mikovits’s study were properly processed after being taken,labs could also later use existing procedures to stimulate the replication ofretroviruses to a high enough level for detection. This was, in part, whyMikovits’s restructuring of Peterson’s sampling methods had been imperativegroundwork for their research. The team went on to explain:After 10–14 days, LNCaP cells tested positive by intracellular flow cytometryfor the presence of XMRV p30 Gag proteins (Fig. 4B). We then confirmed cell freetransmission to the T-Cell line SupT1 by placing cultures of patient PMBC in thetop of 0.22 uM trans-wells in 6 well plates. After three days, the trans-wellswere removed and the Sup T1 cells were positive for XMRV gag sequences byRT-PCR. (Fig. 4C).We next showed secondary infection of cell-free virus could also bedemonstrated, since virions from patients’ activated PBMC were transmitted tonormal CD4+ T-cells and from those T-cells to secondary normal CD4+ T-cells(Fig. 4D). These results strongly support routes of both cell-associated andcell-free transmission of XMRV in this patient population.3[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach11fn_373]Mikovits and her team then addressed the genetic identification of sequences ofthe retrovirus and its homology, or similarity, to known samples of XMRV, todemonstrate a direct linkage between this pathogen and the one in human prostatecancer samples, thus distinguishing it from its mouse counterpart (and labcontamination):Sequences of viral isolates from the peripheral blood of CFS patients werehighly homologous to the XMRV clones constructed from the patients with prostatecancer and share homologies with other well-documented gammaretroviruses.4[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach11fn_374]The previous passage is of vital importance. The “sequences” of virus theyisolated were closely related to the “XMRV clones” (VP-62) that Silverman hadconstructed.Mikovits and her team were comparing the sequences that they had taken fromactual patients with “XMRV clones.” But these XMRV clones could be compared to abad copy machine, producing a replicate, which was of poor quality andsignificantly different from the original. It wasn’t just a matter of comparingapples and oranges, it was like comparing an apple to a Xerox of an apple.Mikovits would later argue that this was the critical mistake made by manyresearchers in their work. They were calling this synthesized XMRV clone, thenatural virus, keeping the standards for calling a match extremely narrow and inthe process missing anything that might be closely related.They then outlined how the detection of the virus in T and B lymphocytes made itconsistent with the “tropism” (the growth or movement of a biological organism)of a retrovirus:In addition, our demonstration that infectious virus is present in both T and Blymphocytes is consistent with the tropism of other well-documented targets ofhuman retroviral infection.5 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach11fn_375]Other researchers had for decades studied similar retroviruses and their diseaseassociations in animal models, as retroviruses can cause both cancer andneurological disease in their animal hosts. Some of the symptoms in animals withretroviral infection look intriguingly like those in known human diseases, andthe conditions have suggestive names such as “retroviral spongiformpolioencephalomyelopathy” and “simian acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.” Thefirst sounds a little like myalgic encephalomyelitis (with a bit of thespongiform Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, or human “mad cow disease,” thrown in),the second if one drops the “simian” turns into Acquired ImmoDeficiencySyndrome: “AIDS”:Several retroviruses such as the MuLVs [mouse leukemia retroviruses], primateretroviruses and HTLV-1 are not only associated with cancer but also associatedwith neurological diseases. Investigation of the molecular mechanism ofretroviral induced neurodegeneration in rodent models revealed vascular andinflammatory changes mediated by cytokines and chemokines and these changes wereobserved prior to any neurological pathology.Neurological maladies and upregulation of inflammatory cytokines and chemokinesare some of the most commonly reported observations associated with CFS; theinvolvement of XMRV may account for some of these observations.6[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach11fn_376]Mouse and monkey retroviruses also induce inflammation and changes in bloodflow, a correlative to the inflammatory markers Mikovits and her team had foundin human patients, the measurable chemokines and cytokines.Retroviral involvement has long been suspected not only for CFS but also forother neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and AmyotrophicLateral Sclerosis (ALS). McCormick et al recently explored the candidacy of XMRVin ALS; however, they did not find XMRV in the blood or CSF [cerebral spinalfluid] of the 25 ALS patients where reverse transcriptase (RT) was detected.7[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach11fn_377]In retroviral research, reverse transcriptase was a smoking gun: an indicationthat a retrovirus was on the scene. To deny the significance of reversetranscriptase in a disease, even if the retrovirus was yet to be determined, wasmuch like ceasing police questioning after ruling out just one suspect in acrime. But a crime had been committed and a suspect was still at large.While Mikovits and her team cautioned that “The causality of XMRV in CFS isprobable but not definitive at this time,” they left little doubt that the pathof future research for CFS might resemble that of AIDS research, whereantiretroviral treatment became the primary focus after HIV was found, andAIDS-associated cancers and opportunistic infections were addressedaggressively, but secondarily to the retrovirus.Retroviruses are strongly associated with malignant transformation andneurological disorders. The higher incidence of neoplasia has been associatedwith outbreaks of CFS; investigation of the role of XMRV infection in cancerdevelopment of this population warrants further study.In HIV infection, co-infection with other pathogens, e.g., herpes viruses,contribute to the disease progression and outcome, thus the association of HHV-6and HHV-7 with CFS (although in this study we found two CFS patients positivefor XMRV but negative for CMV, EBV, HHV-6 and HHV-7) may not be fortuitous, buta strong cofactor.8 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach11fn_378]The researchers’ mention of the two herpes virus-negative CFS patients wouldsupport the idea that herpes viruses were passengers and not drivers in ME/CFS.In AIDS, the presence of HIV opened the door to the bus, but pathogenic“passengers” were varied characters, bringing their own traits that might causeone patient’s skin to bloom with purple lesions and another to have a throatlined with white thrush. Secondary pathogens in ME/CFS, or their reactivationafter a period of dormancy, might also be enough to spur the replication of Band T cells as the vaccines did with children, leading the production of more Band T cell-embedded XMRV and then overwhelming the immune system.Mikovits believed that her team’s revised submission of July 13, 2009, toScience had addressed the relevant concerns of the referees, hence theirsubsequent approval of the publication. But after Science more formally acceptedthe paper on August 31, 2009, its editors wanted a full one-third cut from thearticle. Mikovits did not have a pleasant experience working with the senioreditor. She would email a question and wouldn’t get an answer for weeks, andthen be sent a caustic response along the lines of, “Oh, you’re the worst writerI’ve ever seen. You’ve got all this jargon in there. Eliminate it. All we careabout is the virology.”9 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach11fn_379]What the senior editor considered chaff was the immunology and scientificprecedent that gave background into hunting a retrovirus in ME/CFS. Mikovitsfelt every sentence buttressed the research, and with cuts, there were too manypieces missing.Even with the immunological data, the entire paper was less than eight and ahalf pages in length, double-spaced, not counting the supplemental material,which mostly contained references and pictures of gag sequences from gels,electron micrographs, other figures, and a description of the methods andmaterials used.Mikovits made the changes to the Science article, trying as best she could topreserve the most critical information. But while she edited it, she thought:given the seventeen million people estimated to suffer from ME/CFS worldwide,the 1 in 100 children with autism (increased in 2013 to 1 in 50), not to mentionthe multitudes afflicted with multiple sclerosis and ALS, was it really too muchto ask the world’s leading scientists to read just eight and a half pages?* * *Fortunately, although John Coffin later became Mikovits’s fiercest critic, inthat shining hour he was her champion, publishing supportive commentary inconjunction with her article in Science. After attending the meeting of July 22,2009, at the National Cancer Institute, he understood the centrality of herresearch in the current scientific dialogue.His seven paragraph article coauthored by Jonathon Stoye, “A New Virus for OldDiseases,” was a clarion call to medical researchers about the appearance of aretrovirus in ME/CFS and its alarming implication for other diseases. Coffinseemed like a researcher wrestling with the results of new data, but sincerelyconcerned about the impact of the new information on millions of people withchronic disease. He described the results as showing about two-thirds of ME/CFSpatients as testing positive for XMRV.Both laboratory and epidemiological studies are now needed to determine whetherthe virus has a causative role, not only in this disease, but perhaps in othersas well.10 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach11fn_380]While Mikovits had cut what she considered critical parts of their paper at theeditor’s request, Coffin’s article bolstered her research with excellentbackground on the history of the disease, the retrovirus, and its possibleimportance to further research. He recounted that the virus had first beendetected three years earlier in a few prostate cancer patients, and had recentlybeen discovered in about a quarter of all prostate cancer biopsies. He also wentonto say:It has been isolated from both prostate cancer and chronic fatigue syndromepatients, and is similar to a group of endogenous murine leukemia viruses (MLVs)found in the genomes of inbred and related wild mice.11[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach11fn_381]Coffin had noted the extensive research into gammaretrovirues via animalstudies, and accurately reported that fifty years of investigation intoretroviruses had not shown a link to any human diseases other than HIV/AIDS andhuman T-cell leukemia virus. He then raised the point that retroviruses canbecome integrated in the DNA of an individual, passing from mother to child.Endogenous viruses, such as xenotropic MLV, arise when retroviruses infectgermline cells. The integrated viral DNA, or provirus, is passed on to offspringas part of the host genome. Endogenous proviruses form a large part of thegenetic complement of modern mammals-about 8% of the human genome, forexample.12 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach11fn_382]Then Coffin got to the hot button issues, transmission and the possibility oflab contamination, which would consume so much of Mikovits’s attention in theyears to come.The propensity of xenotropic MLVs to infect rapidly dividing human cells hasmade it a common contaminant in cultured cells, particularly in human tumor celllines.13 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach11fn_383]Coffin identified a theoretical danger posed by the retroviruses, which wastheir ability to infect germ-line cells, those passed from mother to child. Healso explained that the retrovirus did not seem to present a real problem tomice because their cells generally lacked the proper receptors that allowed theretrovirus to gain entry.Just like mice, humans already harbored a large amount of genetic material (8percent according to the latest estimates) that appeared to be viral in origin,meaning that the genetic material of viruses had been fused with human DNA.While mice generally lacked the cellular receptors that would allow theseviruses to enter the cell, humans were not so lucky: they had receptors thatwould allow these same viruses to gain entry into cells. It was known that thesetypes of retroviruses could easily infect human cells cultured in a laboratory,especially cancer cells since they were rapidly dividing cells.Given the propensity of these viruses to contaminate cell cultures, particularlyof cancer cell lines, Coffin next attacked the issue of whether this newdiscovery might conceivably be the result of contamination. His opinion, in whatseemed like a pre-emptive strike given the events to come, was no:There is more than 90% DNA sequence identity between XMRV and xenotropic MLV,and their biological properties are virtually indistinguishable, leaving littledoubt that the former is derived from the latter by one or more cross-speciestransmission events. There are several lines of evidence that transmissionhappened in the outside world and was not a laboratory contaminant.14[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach11fn_384]While Coffin would later become the fiercest proponent of the idea that the XMRVfindings were the result of contamination, it is revealing to read his own wordsat the time of the announcement of the discovery. It is clear that at this timeCoffin believed there were multiple lines of evidence showing this virus to be athreat to the public health, and he detailed them.One is that XMRVs from disparate locations and from both chronic fatiguesyndrome and prostate cancer patients are nearly identical; The viral genomesdiffer by only a few nucleotides, whereas there are hundreds of sequencedifferences between XMRVs and xenotropic murine leukemia proviruses oflaboratory mice. Other evidence includes the presence of XMRV and high amountsof antibodies to XMRV and other MLVs in chronic fatigue syndrome and prostatecancer patients.15 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach11fn_385]Coffin argued cogently that XMRV found in these human samples could not be alaboratory contaminant, because of the pace of its evolutionary advancement. Asa natural consequence of evolution, a virus needed to undergo significantchanges to adapt to a new host, but these varied in mice and humans.There were hundreds of nucleotide sequence differences between the XMRV in thehuman population and similar retroviruses among mice, which implied a distinctevolutionary leap between species. Coffin also noted the presence of antibodiesto XMRV. Human biological materials in a test tube do not generate antibodies.The production of antibodies can only take place in a living organism.Coffin stated that much was still unknown about XMRV—whether it was limited bygeographic region, whether it was a consequence rather than a cause of animpaired immune system, and other concerns.We do not know how the virus is transmitted, and the suggestion, based onindirect evidence, that there is sexual transmission is premature. Given thatinfectious virus is present in plasma and in blood cells, blood-bornetransmission is a possibility. Furthermore, we do not know the prevalence ordistribution of this virus in either human or animal populations, and animalmodels for infection and pathogenesis are badly needed.16[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach11fn_386]Coffin then focused on some important attributes of XMRV—the near-identity ofviruses recovered from individuals in different diseases, and in differentgeographic reasons. This did not seem to bother him, as it meant XMRV was lesslike HIV and more like the lesser known HTLVs.In this respect, XMRV more closely resembles human T cell lymphotropic viruses(HTLVs) isolated from the same geographic region. As in the case with HTLV, thelack of diversity implies that XMRV recently descended from a common ancestor,and that the number of replication cycles within one infected individual islimited.17 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach11fn_387]Genetic drift is an important concept. Among higher organisms, it’s relativelysimple. The more closely related organisms are (say, two siblings), the greaterthe degree of genetic similarity. There are fewer genetic (or nucleotide)differences. However, if one selects a random human being from a countrythousands of miles away from where one’s ancestors originated, there will bemore genetic or nucleotide differences, simply because so many generations havepassed since early ancestors wandered out of Africa to fan out over the globe.As Mikovits had been thinking for some time, XMRV looked more like the humanT-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) co-discovered by Frank Ruscetti, and less like HIV.The lack of diversity among the XMRV isolated from patients meant it had in alllikelihood crossed over into human beings in recent genetic history, and that itdid not appear to go through many cycles of replication once established in aperson (a trait that might help survival, since pathogens are often killedduring a point in a replication cycle, which is why one class of AIDS drugs iscalled “reverse-transcriptase inhibitors”). This might explain why before the1934 epidemic among doctors and nurses at Los Angeles County General Hospitalthis disease had never before been observed, and why autism seemingly emergedduring a similar time frame.Mikovits later recalled how when she showed the evidence of immune and otherbiological abnormalities in ME/CFS patients to a group of doctors at the DefeatAutism Now Conference (DAN) in January of 2010, they had observed thesimilarities to their patient population and made the declaration, “We thinkautism is simply ME/CFS in kids.”18 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach11fn_388]While this statement seemed to leap several fences, researchers such as Dr. RichVan Konynenburg had previously observed common methylation defects in bothpopulations, as well as other overlaps such as specific nutritionaldeficiencies, neurological hypersensitivities, and mitochondrial defects.Researcher Dr. Cecilia Giulivi from the University of California, Davis, whosework was reported in JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association,stated that “Children with mitochondrial diseases may present exerciseintolerance, seizures and cognitive decline, among other conditions . . . Manyof these characteristics are shared by children with autism.”Just as Dr. Sarah Myhill reported on dramatic mitochondria-based energy defectsin ME/CFS patients as measured in blood, Giulivi and her team found in bloodsampling “that mitochondria from children with autism consumed far less oxygenthan mitochondria from the group of control children, a sign of loweredmitochondrial activity.”19 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach11fn_389] Myhill,similarly, found in her published research on ME/CFS patients that “Only 1 ofthe 71 patients overlaps the normal region of mitochondrial functioning.”20[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach11fn_390] These parallel findings are significantwhen one understands that mitochondria are like gas stations for the tissues andorgans, producing energetic “fuel” called ATP, and the heart and brain use upthe largest percentage of this fuel hence they are most vulnerable tomitochondrial defects and sometimes show the most obvious symptoms (such asneurological hypersensitivity, or post-exertional fatigue).Underscoring the possibility that XMRV could be a ticking time bomb in massivenumbers of people, Coffin ended his 2009 Science commentary discussing whatMikovits considered one of the most disturbing findings of their research, theprevalence of the retrovirus in the general population. About 4 percent of thehealthy population showed evidence of having this virus.If these figures are borne out in larger studies, it would mean that perhaps 10million people in the United States and hundreds of millions worldwide areinfected with a virus whose pathogenic potential for humans is still unknown.However, it is clear that closely related viruses cause a variety of majordiseases, including cancer, in many other mammals.21[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach11fn_391]Ten million individuals in the United States and hundreds of millions worldwidemight be infected with this virus. If the virus was hiding out in the B and Tcells of the immune systems of people that meant that any immune challenge, afever, a cold, an accident, and yes, even a vaccination, might be enough to makethe virus come out of its hiding place and rampage through the immune system.And it was clear that Coffin believed the implications might go far beyondprostate cancer and ME/CFS.Further study may reveal XMRV as a cause of more than one well-known “old”disease with potentially important implications for diagnosis, prevention, andtherapy.22 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach11fn_392]Mikovits thought Coffin’s commentary elucidated the most important issues. Themedical community agreed that closely related viruses were responsible for “avariety of major diseases” and that it was possible that many more diseaseswould be found in association with XMRV.In the days leading up to October 8, 2009, patients in the ME/CFS buzzed thatScience was going to publish groundbreaking research on the illness. The newsspread like wildfire, lighting up blogs and phone lines. Patients had grown waryof hope, yet knew that being represented in the hallowed pages of Science withauspicious backing seemed hugely promising. Patients with shifted circadianrhythms awoke early, or just stayed up all night, and then October 8, 2009dawned.The scientific community was looking at the largest retroviral threat to theworld since HIV/AIDS."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWELVEDay Five and Freedom?On November 15, 2011, Dr. Lipkin emailed that Dr. Mikovits would be the studyprincipal investigator in my lab at National Cancer Institute. Her participationwas considered essential for the accuracy of the replication study. On November17, 2011, I was notified of an official internal review of my laboratory conductof the XMRV affair. On November 30, Lipkin notified me that NIH [NationalInstitutes of Health] supervisors had banned her from the NIH and security woulduphold the ban . . . The failure to have Dr. Mikovits’s full participation meantto me that it was not a full replication study that the NIH wanted.—Frank Ruscetti1 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach12fn_393]Tuesday, November 22, 2011The wakeup call came during the hour of farm reports and hot cups of coffeesomewhere on the “outside.” Marie slept like a pile of sandbags, while Mikovitswaited by the small window in the door as pre-dawn blackness became light. Shecould only think that soon she would again enjoy the predawn cup of coffee Davidmade her each day. This was the day of her arraignment and she expected to makebail.At 9:00 a.m., a guard told her to get ready to move out. She rolled her mattressand stuffed her blanket and papers in the jail-issued box. Then she was taken toa group of more seasoned inmates in A3 block. They were housed in an overloadspace in the common room. The guards directed Mikovits to set her box on one ofthe bunks and wait with the group.From there, the guards would call up individuals, escort them to a holding cellwhere they waited for transport for several hours before being shackled toanother prisoner, and then loaded onto the bus for the trip to the courthouse.2[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach12fn_394] When Mikovits was called up, the guard toldher to leave her box, which meant she would have to return even if she madebail. It was extremely discouraging news.The repeat offenders were rowdy: one flirted with the male prisoners, peelingoff her shirt to flash them. Drugs like heroin had made a comeback in southernCalifornia, so there was a different kind of “combination drug therapy” makingrounds. A few inmates were pretty rough-cut, while some were just big talkers.There was one nicknamed “Crazy Mary,” who seemed almost giddy. She had beenpicked up for public drinking but was homeless, living in a small encampment ona walking trail behind a grocery store in Ventura. Even in southern California,November and December were tough months to be on the streets, rainy and chilly.Mary was skinny as a rail and had the rough, leathery skin of sun-bakedCalifornians.The guards seemed to like Mary. Mikovits gathered from their playful jabs thatMary got herself picked up a few times a year, normally when the temperaturedropped or she needed reliable meals. Mary prattled about current events,somebody’s hair, past music festivals. She was fun and light, but Mikovits stillhoped to be shackled to another low-key woman she recognized from before, Karen.Instead, as luck would have it, Mikovits was paired with Crazy Mary.For the shackling, one prisoner put her hands behind her back to be handcuffed,and then the shackles and chains were attached to those of another prisoner. Themale prisoners were led out first and then the guards returned for the women.Mikovits and Crazy Mary were the last to get onto the big white bus with blackletters identifying Ventura County Sheriff’s Office. Every two seats of theinterior were housed in an individually locked cage, and they were placed rightbehind the driver. For the fifteen-minute ride, they were shackled to eachother, locked to the cage, and then locked inside the cage.Chatting up the whole bus, Crazy Mary zeroed in on Mikovits. Mary asked whatkind of music she liked and did she have any brothers or sisters? Mikovits hadbeen staring out the window like someone trapped on a long flight beside atoddler. But Mary turned out to be friendly and funny, so Mikovits dropped herguard: “I’ve got an older brother, a twin sister, and a younger sister” shereplied.“You got a twin sister?” Crazy Mary yelled incredulously over sudden trafficnoise. “Well, is she just like you?”“Sometimes we’re almost the same, sometimes we’re so different,” Mikovitsreplied, with Mary giving a serious nod.The bus pulled up to the Hall of Justice, a drab, four-story southern Californiaoffice building with politely-placed fountains and palm trees. It was a civicstructure of facile appearances, an illusion of order and security. But insteadof stopping at the public entrances, the bus drove to the cavernous undergroundgarage, pulling up to an area often referred to as “the dungeons,” whereprisoners were held before court appearances.They were led toward a holding cell where the group of about eight women shareda single toilet and a few benches. On the way there, one guard offered a paperbag lunch of two pieces of white bread and a slice of bologna. Mikovits wasabout to hand it back when Crazy Mary protested, “Don’t!” and snatched thecrinkly brown paper from Mikovits’s hand. Undernourished and obviously not surewhen she was going to eat again, Mary wolfed down both sandwiches.After what seemed like an incredibly long time but was probably not much longerthan two hours, they were escorted from their cells, up a back elevator, andwere placed in a specially designed cage at the back of the courtroom.From a prisoners’ cage behind the judge’s bench, Mikovits could see David andsome of her friends in the spectator’s gallery. Her lawyer, a prominent criminaldefense attorney, stood a slim six foot three with a smooth shaved head,glasses, and a sharp professional air.“It’s all right,” were the first words he said to her, adding that he knew shedidn’t want to be extradited to Reno and would not let it happen. She wasgreatly relieved.“But there’s another issue,” said her attorney. “There’s a reporter here fromScience, Jon Cohen. He wants to take a picture of you in court.”Mikovits recalled how Cohen had been the one who included the comment fromCoffin in the Science article the previous September, comparing her to Joan ofArc. Cohen was also the writer Coffin had designated at the “Invitation Only”meeting in July of 2009 at the National Cancer Institute, three months prior tothe publication of the XMRV article, to explain the story to the public.Mikovits couldn’t help but believe that Cohen was playing for the other team.Mikovits told her lawyer she did not want her picture taken.Cohen painted the scene for the readers of Science Insider in his November 22,2011, piece entitled, “Inmate Mikovits Meets Judge.”3[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach12fn_395] The article described her entering Room 13of the Superior Court in a “prison-issued blue jump suit with an orange T-shirtunderneath,” the area for the inmates in the courtroom was a“room-within-the-room that had white metal bars for walls,” the “four bailiffswith Taser guns,” and the other inmates who were “heavily muscled and tattooedmen and street-tough women.” Cohen noted that the fifty-three-year-old Mikovits“appeared composed, but wildly out of place.”4[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach12fn_396]It seemed to Mikovits that as she was talking to her attorney, Cohen was lookingfor an opportunity to photograph her disheveled state. She told this to herattorney, and he obliged by blocking her from Cohen’s view. After blocking Cohenfrom taking any possible shot, he told Mikovits that she would probably bereleased on bail to her own recognizance. What she did not know at the time wasthat after the call from Max and Harvey, David had found the notebooks in thebox of towels and linens and surrendered them to the police only a few hoursearlier. After the judge heard about a dozen other cases, Mikovits pled notguilty and waived extradition to Reno. The judge then asked about Cohen’s photorequest. Mikovits and her attorney vehemently answered “No.”The judge asked Cohen to speak about why he wanted the picture. Cohen assertedthat a photograph could let others in the science world see what was possible inthese situations. Mikovits felt that she was being displayed as a warning foranyone in science who dared venture into controversial areas. The judge notedthat Mikovits had not been convicted of any crime and concluded, “I can see nobenefit to the scientific community in putting the picture of a woman presumedinnocent in a professional journal.”An extradition specialist then took the podium to detail why extradition to Renowas not required. Her attorney joined him in explaining to the judge thatMikovits had owned her home in Ventura County since July of 2003; that she’d hada normal homing instinct right after being fired and returned to her home, andshe was no “flight risk.”The two of them explained how Mikovits had been welcomed back to her community,a fact supported by the many friends from her church and yacht club who were inthe courtroom.After confirming that she could post bail, the judge ordered that she did nothave to appear in Reno and that she be released immediately from custody.* * *Unbeknownst to Mikovits a very different chain of events had been taking placein Reno, Nevada, New York City, and Bethesda, Maryland. A conference call washeld on Monday, November 21, 2011, the day before her arraignment, betweenRuscetti, Lipkin, and Harvey and Annette Whittemore to discuss securingMikovits’s release from jail and settling the civil lawsuit against her.5[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach12fn_397]Ruscetti recalled, “Mr. Whittemore started the conversation by saying: ‘We toldJudy that she could have a copy of the notebooks.’ I replied ‘I have read theapplication for TRO [Temporary Restraining Order] and that is a bold face lie.’Before a verbal fight could ensure, Lipkin interrupted and emphatically toldWhittemore that the culture of scientific community demands that scientists haveaccess to their data and that of their students, for multiple reasons.Whittemore was insistent that the notebooks had to be returned before Mikovits(we always referred to her as “Judy”) could post bail and be released fromjail.”6 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach12fn_398]When the conference call was over, Ruscetti and Lipkin talked privately aboutthe situation, and Ruscetti sent a follow-up email to Harvey in which he wrotethat many of Judy’s relatives believed Harvey was “capable of doing her physicalharm.”7 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach12fn_399]Harvey emailed back that “we would never do anyone physical harm. That is justsimply insane,” then advised Frank not to “become an accessory after the fact”and suggested “her lawyers should immediately call the Washoe County DistrictAttorney.”8 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach12fn_400]Ruscetti then called Whittemore “and told him I didn’t appreciate beingthreatened. Harvey replied that his response was not a threat, just friendlyadvice.”9 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach12fn_401]The notebooks were returned to the Ventura County Sheriff’s office in southernCalifornia first thing in the morning of Tuesday November 22, 2011, byMikovits’s husband, David Nolde.10 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach12fn_402] Laterthat morning, Harvey sent the following email to Ruscetti. “Frank, the firstpositive step has taken place, but the damage continues because Judy’s lawyersfailed to provide a statement to her ‘bloggers’ to stop the stupid attacks onthe WPI and Annette. If David can help Judy understand this and direct thesepeople to simply stop we will have a very good chance of a positive outcome. Iwill do everything I can to help the authorities get her out of jail today intime for Thanksgiving with her family. This is not my decision, but I will helpas is appropriate.”11 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach12fn_403]Frank discussed the situation some more with Harvey Whittemore that day.Whittemore told Ruscetti that Mikovits needed to pay the Whittemore PetersonInstitute $200,000 in restitution for their investigation, even though he knewshe did not have that kind of money.12 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach12fn_404]Whittemore also wanted Mikovits to sign an apology letter so that “the internetbloggers would stop their attacks on the WPI and the Whittemores.”13[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach12fn_405] Ruscetti then “told Mr. Whittemore that thestimulus for the bloggers’ attack was WPI’s illegal firing of Judy, the legalattack by WPI against Judy, and WPI’s arrangement to have her thrown in jail.”14[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach12fn_406]Frank eventually tried to edit an “apology letter” drafted by Harvey and AnnetteWhittemore. He was aided in this effort by Ian Lipkin, but the two of thembecame convinced that the apology as written by the Whittemores was “anadmission of guilt and had criminal consequences.”15[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach12fn_407] A selection of some of the passages, whichthey found to be problematic:“I am deeply and honestly sorry from the depths of my heart and soul for causinggreat harm to the Whittemore Peterson Institute, patients around the world whocounted on me, and all those who work at the Institute . . .“I deeply regret that I am responsible for allowing those closest to me tocreate a cesspool of mistrust about the Whittemores, telling lies about them,and not stopping the malicious rumors from spreading out of control when I couldhave. The Whittemores have done nothing to deserve this horrible treatment byme, my friends and those who think they are acting on my behalf . . .“I promise to restore the faith that all of you had in me by dedicating my lifeto honest and careful scientific discovery. I want to make full restitution tothose I have hurt by having my apology posted on all blogs, forums, and websitesby those who have inaccurately reported stories adverse to the interests of theInstitute and those associated with it. . .”16[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach12fn_408]But the effort foundered when Ruscetti became convinced that the Whittemoreswere going to use the apology against her in a civil hearing, scheduled in Reno,Nevada, on November 22, 2011, the same day Judy was scheduled for herarraignment in southern California. Ruscetti could not understand how a personwho was in jail in one state could be expected to prepare her defense for a casein another state.For Ruscetti, it all looked like a rigged game and he didn’t want any part ofit.When this became clear to Ruscetti after Harvey’s urgent texts that the apologyneeded to be signed that day, he recalled, “I did not call Mr. Whittemorebecause I knew that Dr. Lipkin and I had been duped and Harvey was planning touse the apology as a confession against Judy at the hearing.”17[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach12fn_409]* * *After her termination from the WPI, but before her arrest, Mikovits wanted tocontinue her work with Lipkin on the XMRV replication study. On November 15,2011, she sent him an email which seemed to set the ground rules for the study.She wrote to Lipkin, “Thank you for giving me the opportunity to do thereplication study in Frank Ruscetti’s lab at the NCI. I understand that no moneycan be given for these studies but that you can provide resources, such as PCRand culture supplies and sequencing or other services (contracted through athird party). Frank will need to get permission for me to work as a specialvolunteer from Drs. Fauci and Varmus in order for me to work in his lab.”18[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach12fn_410] (Anthony Fauci was head of the NationalInstitute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases and Harold Varmus was head of theNational Cancer Institute.)As things eventually shaped up, the agreement for Mikovits’s participation inthe Lipkin multi-center study must surely rank as one of the most unusual in allof science.In an email sent on December 1, 2011, to Varmus and copied to Fauci andRuscetti, Lipkin wrote that Mikovits would be associated with the NationalCancer Institute for purposes of the replication study, but she could not stepfoot on the NCI campus, a prohibition which would be enforced by security.19[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach12fn_411]Ruscetti would later call this banning of a scientist from working in a lab andyet wanting to have her name on the ensuing paper, “unprecedented incontemporary American science.”20 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach12fn_412]Mikovits strongly believed that her questions about XMRV, ME/CFS, autism, andthe possible role of vaccines had caused consternation at the highest levels ofthe scientific community. But in her wildest dreams she’d never imagined ascientific study of international importance would contain a clause which heldthat a scientist would be designated as working at a specific lab, (the NationalCancer Institute where she’d been employed for more than twenty years), but alsoprovide that the scientist could not step foot on the grounds of that lab orwould be escorted away by security.It was a little like the Catholic Church allowing Galileo to participate in a“replication study,” but then denying him the use of his telescope.* * *Mikovits thought she’d be released soon after the hearing, but she and Karenwere ordered to get back on the bus. Mikovits protested but a guard said therewas no paperwork authorizing her release.As they were processed at Todd Road, the receiving guard saw the names andexclaimed, “You’re not supposed to be here!” Within an hour both Karen and Judywere in a van heading back to the Ventura County Courthouse.Back in the catacombs, Mikovits joined the prisoners who had made bail and wereslowly transitioning back to freedom. Their clothes and personal belongings werereturned: for Mikovits this meant gym clothes, flip-flops, and her baseball cap.She had also surrendered her wedding ring after the arrest, slipping it into hergym shorts pocket. It had not been off since she married David in 2000, so shehad the thought that he should be the one to put it back on.The guards offered another bag lunch and Mikovits had the good sense to take it,handing it off to Crazy Mary. Mary was still chatting, occasionally flittingover to Mikovits to ask a question.At one point she asked, “What were you in here for?” Mikovits explained herstory. Mary listened in rapt attention then shouted, “This is a doctor! This isa PhD! She’s in here because she stole her own brain!” Mikovits couldn’t helpwondering why it seemed her story only made sense to a homeless woman withsomething of a sketchy grasp of reality.Mary’s shouts attracted two sergeants. One of them asked Mikovits, “So, you’re aPhD?”“Yeah,” said Mikovits. “When I came in they only asked me if I’d graduated fromhigh school and I said yes. I figured I shouldn’t answer questions you didn’task.”The guards started laughing. Since cancer is such a universal disease, a few ofthem asked if she might have anything to offer their family members or friendswith cancer. Mikovits said sure and collected a few of their cards.Wherever Mikovits went, it seemed like she was picking up patients.Mikovits and Karen were ushered out at the same time and ushered out into thenearly empty lobby of the Ventura County Courthouse at the same time, butneither of their husbands were there. The two of them walked out into the largeparking lots, looking around in vain. Mikovits remembered a nearby restaurantand thought they might let her use the phone to call David. But Karen wanted tocontinue looking in the parking lot.“I hope you get your brain back!” she said wryly, in parting, though Mikovitswas more concerned about getting her reputation and credibility back.* * *At the Hill Street Café Mikovits asked to use their phone to call bail bondsman,Bill Burns to arrange a meeting. She also called David.When Bill arrived, he found Mikovits a little dazed, drinking a beer at thecounter. Burns would later recall she had “just this sense of wonder about whathad happened to her.”21 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach12fn_413]It was Bill’s experience that among people who had spent their whole livesoutside of the criminal justice system and suddenly found themselves at itsmercy, there was often a “wide-eyed amazement at what can happen to a person.”This was often coupled with a profound relief at leaving jail.David walked in soon, and they headed over to Bill’s office, signed the papers,copied their drivers licenses on the Xerox, and wished each other a happyThanksgiving.* * *The Nolde clan had planned to spend the holiday week at the Sonoma Mission Inn,starting the previous Sunday, but David had gotten them to hold the reservation.Mikovits said she didn’t want to go back to their house because it would onlyserve as a reminder of her upsetting arrest. She asked that he simply pack asuitcase of their things and they start driving north from the café. Theyplanned to have lunch with one of David’s sons in San Francisco the next day,then make the final hour and a half drive from the city to the pastoral SonomaWine Country dappled with gnarled old grapevines.“Try not to speed,” Bill Burns said as he left them.They headed up north in their 2003 blue Audi A6 and it was clear to Judy thather husband was rattled. He relayed how he’d been on the phone constantly withFrank and Harvey over the past few days, trying to figure out a solution toeverything. He mentioned Harvey’s “apology letter” and showed it to her.She started to read it with trepidation and finally said, “I’d never sign this.”David said nothing; he stared ahead with tears of frustration and reliefwelling.“We just wanted to get you out before Thanksgiving.”* * *Judy also learned what had happened to her friend, Lilly Meehan, on the day ofher arrest.Lilly had first read about Mikovits shortly after the October 8, 2009,publication of her XMRV article in the journal Science. When she noticedMikovits’s email address as the senior author, she jotted off a message abouther close family member who’d been struck by ME/CFS at the age of fifteen andwas completely disabled. Lilly was surprised when Mikovits speedily wrote backand found that the scientist often spent weekends and vacations at her Oxnard,California, home—as luck would have it, not far from where Lilly lived.They made plans to have lunch when Mikovits came home for the Christmasholidays. Mikovits told her to be sure to bring her family member with ME/CFS ifthat person could manage it. When they sat down for lunch Mikovits quickly askedthe family member about her symptoms, such as light sensitivity, nausea,post-exertional fatigue; the kind of questions the other doctors almost neverasked that Lilly knew as central features.The women became fast-friends, and when the unpleasantness started with theWhittemores, Lilly had launched a public outcry. As the situation deterioratedfrom a wrongful termination into a civil lawsuit on November 9, 2011, Lillypublicly posted a response from Mikovits’s attorney at the time.If she had understood more about legal culture, she would have fullycomprehended the bad strategy of publishing it, but since Annette was postingaccusations against Mikovits on the WPI’s Facebook page, it was already public.Shortly before her arrest, Mikovits was convinced she was being followed.Lilly believed it was a credible threat. Soon after, from the second floor ofher house, Lilly saw a man walking along the sidewalk and suspected he was aprocess-server for the Whittemores. Moments later, he rang her doorbell. Lillyfroze and stayed quiet in her home, and then did a few chores.She soon heard men’s voices in her backyard and then three men entered her housethrough the back door.Within a minute, Lilly counted a total of nine police officers in her home. Theysat her in the recliner in her living room while the police officers searchedher house, handing her an odd search warrant. It listed her address, the issuingjudge (the Honorable R. Wright), and the case agent supervisor (DetectiveHorigan), but not any items for which they were searching.Lilly later showed the search warrant to her sister-in-law, a paralegal. Becauseof the lack of specificity in the text, Lilly’s sister-in-law simply stated,“Something powerful is behind this.” With Lily in her recliner and two policemenstanding guard, the rest of the officers searched her house.For Lilly, who considered herself a model citizen, having been marriedthirty-six years and never having gotten so much as a traffic ticket, it wasboth surreal and traumatizing. She heard police officers rifling through boxesthat had been in the attic for years. “I kept wondering how this could happen,”she later explained.Mikovits called Lilly at 8:15 the morning after her release to apologize forwhat she had endured.“Those were her notebooks,” Lilly later said, with outrage. “She was theprincipal investigator. They couldn’t deny them to her. She was supposed to havethem.”* * *The next morning while David was showering, his cell-phone rang. Judy picked itup. “Hello?” she said.“Is David there?” asked the familiar voice of Harvey Whittemore.“He’s in the shower.”“I shouldn’t be talking to you, but have David call me,” said Harvey brusquely.There was a pause in his voice, something that Mikovits hoped was a small shredof humanity from a man she’d considered family for the past five years. “I’mreally glad you’re out of jail,” he said gruffly.“Yeah, right,” said Mikovits hanging up.She didn’t even tell David about the call.* * *Later, they were driving up to San Francisco to visit David’s son for lunch,when a call came in from her civil attorney, Dennis Neil Jones.“You need to turn yourself in at the Reno courthouse on Monday morning,” hesaid. Mikovits said the judge in Ventura ruled she was free on bail so shewasn’t going. But Jones insisted it was mandatory. “You’ll be in and out in acouple hours,” he promised. He’d found criminal attorneys for her in Reno. Theywere now handling the criminal case.A preliminary injunction had been issued from the Reno court on November 22,2011 (the day she’d been arraigned in southern California), and it ordered herto make copies of all her personal emails to provide them to the court.When Mikovits phoned, the attorney answered and seemed to know her case.Mikovits told the attorney she had been released on bail and was not turningherself in to the court in Reno as she never possessed any property of the WPI.The attorney insisted that if Mikovits did not turn herself in, she would bepicked up and jailed.Mikovits unleashed her frustration. She had paid the bail, and besides that, shehad not seen the notebooks or the birthday bag since October 17. The attorneyrepeated that she must be there by 11:00 a.m. on Monday or police would pick herup.On their “vacation” at the Sonoma Mission Inn, David and Judy went to an Applestore and bought an iPad and tried to download all 22,000 emails from Mikovits’spersonal Gmail accounts, excluding the ones that contained classified patientinformation or the ones irrelevant to her WPI work. Mikovits and her husbanddrove directly from Sacramento to the Reno office of her new criminal attorneys,Scott Freeman and Tammy Riggs. The attorneys escorted them to the courthousewhere they were besieged by news reporters.Mikovits was booked, had her mug shot taken, and told she was free to go. Butsomeone else was waiting in Reno: Jon Cohen of Science.And he finally got the mug shot denied him by the California judge. A mug shotto adorn his article on Mikovits.“Dispute over Lab Notebooks Lands Researcher in Jail” was the headline in theDecember 2, 2011, issue of Science, complete with the mug shot.22[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach12fn_414]* * *One issue that needs to be addressed is how Frank Ruscetti’s name came to appearon a paper authored by John Coffin entitled, “Multiple Sources of Contaminationin Samples from Patients Reported to Have XMRV Infection” published in Februaryof 2012.23 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach12fn_415] For many following the XMRVstory, it seemed a significant change in Ruscetti’s support of Mikovits and herinvestigation, especially since he was Mikovits’s mentor and one of her mostprominent and respected supporters.In July of 2014, Ruscetti explained how his name came to be on the paper:In August 2010, blood samples drawn from the homes of patients and controls weresent to my lab at NCI where cells and plasma were separated and sent to the DrugResistance program (DRP)(directed by Coffin). They reported that on August 23that all four ME/CFS patient plasma had MLV and mouse DNA, but no XMRV, while2/5 normal had XMRV, but no MLV or mouse DNA. These patients had not been foundto be XMRV positive.24 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach12fn_416]Nothing was said about this data, for almost a year, after the SOK [State ofKnowledge, 2011] conference where Alter stated there was no evidence ofcontamination at the WPI. I was never allowed to see any of the data before mybosses. It smelled like an inquisition.I was aghast when I saw a draft of the paper. The original 2010 data was in thepaper without any replication and the tone of the paper placed most of the blamefor multiple contamination on the WPI and Dr. Mikovits. Since there was noevidence in this paper supporting that contamination and my belief the XMRVpresence in the normal donors came from making of the DNA in the Coffin lab, Ideclined to be an author. On October 6, 2011, [a week after Dr. Mikovits hadbeen terminated from the WPI] I was told it would be good for my career if I wasa coauthor.Since there was an internal review of my program looming and a reevaluation offunding in two years instead of the usual four, I relented and consented.25[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach12fn_417]* * *As a scientist, Mikovits was trained to consider data points to determine if anylarger patterns could be found.First, she’d been arrested at her home on Friday, November 18, 2011, without anarrest warrant, and held without bail until Tuesday, November 22, 2011.Second, because she’d been in jail in southern California she couldn’t preparefor or appear in Reno, Nevada, on Tuesday, November 22, 2011, for the civil casebrought by the Whittemores. At that hearing, the judge issued a preliminaryorder that she turn over all of her emails, something she could not do accordingto privacy laws regarding study participants.Third, the most powerful scientific authorities in her field, Anthony Fauci ofthe National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases and Harold Varmus ofthe National Cancer Institute, wanted her name on the Lipkin multi-center study,but didn’t want her setting foot in a lab, an edict they were willing to back upwith security.Fourth, at her southern California hearing, the judge had denied Jon Cohen’srequest for a picture of her in her prison garb, and denied that she had toappear in Reno.Fifth, after being released, it was suddenly mandatory that she appear in Reno,and when she arrived, Jon Cohen was waiting.“You must really have pissed off someone important,” the bail bondsman, BillBurns, had told Mikovits after he first investigated her case.Mikovits was starting to believe she must have pissed off a lot of importantpeople."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THIRTEENThe Counter Offensive“We and others are looking at our own specimens and trying to confirm it,” hesaid, adding, “If we validate it, great. My expectation is that we will not.”1[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach13fn_418]—Dr. William ReevesFour days after the Science article lit up the media, the ME/CFS director at theCDC—William Reeves—publicly dismissed the idea of a retroviral association withME/CFS and broadcast a damning prophesy in the New York Times, saying his teamdid not expect to validate the XMRV findings. They had not performed a singleexperiment, and moreover had attended the July 22 meeting, worked with thesamples, and found no issues with the Mikovits team’s research findings.Patients with ME/CFS had grown weary of William Reeves’s decades-long claim thattheir symptoms were psychological.Around the time of the October 2009 Science publication, Reeves may have beenworking on his research that was later published the following July in hiscoauthored paper, “Personality Features and Personality Disorders in ChronicFatigue Syndrome: A Population-Based Study,” which concluded that, “CFS isassociated with an increased prevalence of maladaptive personality features andpersonality disorders. This might be associated with being noncompliant withtreatment suggestions, displaying unhealthy behavioral strategies and lacking astable social environment.”2 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach13fn_419]Reeves had taken over the NIH’s ME/CFS program from Dr. Stephen Strauss (aphysician turned virologist), who was also quoted in the New York Times in 2001(eight years before the Science publication) on his belief that “What’simportant about CFS is many people get over it. Individuals who have it for manyyears lose hope. They then take on a series of maladaptive behaviors, whichsustain their illness because they become so focused and so phobic: they avoidexercise, disrupt their sleep patterns. It gets harder and harder for them toregain normalcy.”3 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach13fn_420]Patients had to wonder what these government heads would consider an “adaptive”as opposed to a “maladaptive” set of illness “behaviors,” when most of themexpressed a relentless wish to deal positively with hardship, by seeking outsocial networks, downgrading to new hobbies that matched their limitedabilities, and pursuing medical care that might help them get their lives back.One patient in an ME/CFS support group was told by her admiring doctor, “You’renot depressed enough given what you’re dealing with!”* * *Andrea Whittemore’s picture appeared with the New York Times article, quotingReeves. She was leaning on a couch, still youthful but with a drawn, pale face apretty blue blouse hugging her thin frame, her blonde hair and make-up styled,with her right arm crooked across a pillow and her head almost leaning againsther hand. The last detail was not lost on ME/CFS patients, who joked about theiralternate reality to that of “The Uprights”—people who could stand up easilywithout propping themselves on something. An oxygen tube curled from the loweredge of the picture up to the nasal cannula peeking out from Andrea’s pert nose.At thirty-one, she had been sick for nineteen years. She looked directly intothe camera as if to say, I’m here, I exist.The New York Times summarized the history of the disorder well, butimpersonally. It seemed to describe a natural oddity, rather than conveying thehorror of a tragic, devastating affliction for millions around the world. ME/CFSwas so destructive that patient communities had gone decades without thephysical ability to arrange large protest marches on the Washington Mall. It washard to stand up and demand your rights when standing itself often presentedmany challenges.The journal Nature gave the isolation and association of XMRV with ME/CFS somepositive press, although it also covered the position of William Reeves. Naturepublished their XMRV article October 8, 2009, in coordination with the articlein Science, adding additional information on further research efforts that hadgone on since the May 23, 2009, submission.4[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach13fn_421] They noted that the authors detected XMRVin the immune cells of 67 percent of the ME/CFS patients but in only 3.7 percentof healthy controls, and that the authors showed that the virus was able tospread from infected immune cells to cultured prostate cancer cells. They alsonoted the authors’ finding that the virus’ DNA sequence was more than 99 percentsimilar to the sequence of the virus associated with prostate cancer.Mikovits believed the association between XMRV and ME/CFS may have been evenstronger than her team’s work indicated. She wanted to study ME/CFS exposure tothe virus more broadly. In an unpublished investigation, she and her colleaguesanalyzed blood cells in about 330 ME/CFS patients and found that more than 95percent had evidence of XMRV infection, whereas only about 4 percent of healthycontrols did.5 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach13fn_422]While the Nature article quoted the negative prediction from Reeves, it alsoended with comments from Coffin, who was still then very supportive of the XMRVresearch. The Tufts University virologist who had studied MLV (mouse leukemiavirus) pointed out that the XMRV virus’ prevalence in healthy controls “is insome ways, an equally striking result. It’s highly preliminary, but if it’s infact representative, then there are 10 million Americans with this infection,which is very similar to MLV and is now linked to two important diseases.”Coffin added: “There’s a lot we don’t know, including whether XMRV causesdisease, but that’s always the case when the first paper, like this one, comesout.” Overall, the early press coverage was positive, but there were hints thatthe battle ahead would be more brutal than anyone imagined.* * *The night of the publication, Mikovits and her team gathered at the Whittemoremansion.6 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach13fn_423] It was fall in the Sierras, withmild sunny Reno days dropping to near-freezing at night. The first winter stormsexpected to dump snow on the high mountain passes were only a few weeks away.But the Whittemore mansion was warm and inviting, and Harvey and Annette had—intheir usual gracious style of hosting—made sure there was enough food and drinkfor everybody. Mikovits, Peterson, Lombardi, University President Milt Glick,and their research staff including Katy Hagen and Max Pfost were present alongwith other dignitaries. Harvey knew which news shows would be covering the XMRVstory, and the group watched in rapt silence as the screen displayed pictures oftheir lab and interviews with Mikovits and other scientists commenting on thework. The attendees felt like they were part of a pivotal moment in sciencehistory, like NASA employees at a private showing of the moon landing.The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) wanted to hold the first liveinterview with the researchers for their morning radio show UK Radio 5 Live—withNicky Campbell and Shelagh Fogarty—on October 9, 2009.7[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach13fn_424] Since the interview would start at aroundmidnight Nevada time due to the time difference, the group was tired but alittle wired. England was home to several academic researchers who believedME/CFS was nothing more than “mass hysteria” including psychiatrist SimonWessely, who had taken to calling the disorder a “functional somatic syndrome,”which was simply “mass hysteria” under another name.8[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach13fn_425] It was a little like calling a woman “adaily serial monogamist with a rotating list of intimate partners” rather than a“tramp.” They were still calling the patients crazy, but with just a bit morediscretion.The derogatory view of the illness, typically called myalgic encephalomyelitis(ME) in England, had apparently infected the BBC radio hosts and their tonebecame patronizing. The host mocked patients, and by extension the researchers,as mentally unstable.Hagen retorted by addressing them in a faux British accent like a chiding nanny,and when the BBC team realized they were being laughed at, they cut away to theweather. Mikovits observed that Annette seemed to disapprove of Hagen’s antics,but the rest of the team enjoyed the comic relief.* * *The Mikovits team found rousing support at home. The Whittemores hosted Ruscettiand Mikovits and her fellow researchers at their skybox suite at the Universityof Nevada, Reno’s Mackay Stadium for a football game by the team and itsfanatical fans known as the “Wolf Pack.”9 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach13fn_426]Mikovits enjoyed watching the Wolf Pack take on adversaries from the awesomeview in the skybox. University President Milt Glick often dropped by to sayhello.“Hey, Judy, turn around,” said Harvey eagerly, during the half-time show. On theJumbotron was a tribute to Mikovits and Annette Whittemore for the publicationin Science. The scrawl noted that this was only the second time in theuniversity’s history that an article from their school had been published in theprestigious journal.Thirty thousand fans of the Wolf Pack roared their approval, sports fanscheering on science. Glick smiled and shook Mikovits’s hand, offeringcongratulations.It was a banner moment for all of them: a good game, good company, and footballfans unexpectedly showering love for their scientific accomplishments.* * *Within a few weeks of publication, the research team began receiving lettersforwarded by Science from researchers, including one from a group at the BritishMedical Journal inquiring about their patient selection. The group seemedcritical of the attempt to find a cause behind the disorder, without having agood handle on the virology.The editors of Science often gave the Mikovits team just twenty-four hours todraft a response, which meant everybody had to drop everything they were doingto respond.An email exchange between the senior editor at Science and Mikovits on January5, 2010, revealed the decaying nature of their relationship. The letter referredto their response as “carelessly prepared” and that “The reader should come awayknowing exactly what criteria you used for CFS diagnosis and who exactly werestudied as healthy controls (and how many controls were studied).” The senioreditor added, “If you cannot send us a clear, informative and polished Response,I’m afraid we will have no choice but to publish the Tecchnical Comments ontheir own without a Response from you.”10 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach13fn_427]The “carelessly prepared” document and accompanying material sent to Science inresponse to questions raised by Lloyd, Sudlow, and van de Meer is reproduced inpart below:In our recent publication in Science (1) we analyzed blood cells from a patientpopulation with a clinical diagnosis of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) and foundthat sequences encoding the human retrovirus XMRV were present in 67% (68 of101) of the patients but in only 3.7% (8 of 218) of healthy individuals. Ourobservation of actively replicating virus as well as antibodies directed againstXMRV in this CFS patient population strengthened the hypothesis that this virus,which has also been detected in a subset of prostate cancers (2, 3), is a humanpathogen . . .. . . Clinically, CFS is a heterogeneous syndrome and its diagnosis is based onthe exclusion of other diseases. Thus, the criteria used for the diagnosis ofCFS varies greatly. All patient samples included in our study were diagnosed bya licensed physician, using the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) criteria thatdiagnosis of CFS requires that an individual have persistent and relapsingfatigue for six months. All other known medical conditions had been excluded.The patients included in our study all met at least four of the eight criteriadefined by the (CDC) (4) as a prerequisite for CFS diagnosis; tender axillarylymph nodes, sore throat, significantly impaired cognition and short termmemory, muscle pain, multi-joint pain, new headaches, unrefreshing sleep andpost-exertional malaise lasting more than 23 hours. The patient samples used inthe present study were not selected with any bias other than a clinicaldiagnosis of CFS.The CFS patients were from the United States. Blood samples were drawn frompatients in 2006–2009 from 35 patients identified in the 1984–1988 CFS outbreakin Incline Village, Nevada; 15 sporadic cases came from upstate New York, 15sporadic cases from North Carolina and Florida, 36 diverse cases from westernUnited States, Canada, Australia, and Ireland. Inclusion in the study was basedon a diagnosis of CFS which met the CDC and Canadian consensus diagnosis of CFSregardless of severity.The study population was 67% female, reflecting the gender incidence of CFS, andthe age distribution was 19–75 years of age with a mean of 55. The controlpopulation of 320 was from samples drawn from healthy people visiting doctor’soffices in the western United States. These samples were from used as controlsfor the PCR studies. The healthy controls used in the study were representativeof the at-risk population (that is, zip code matched as well as age and gendermatched).For both patients and controls, peripheral blood mononuclear cells werecollected from heparinized blood and aliquoted into four samples: RNA, DNA,protein plasma and DMSO freeze for culture later. Samples were prepared within 6hours of blood draw and frozen immediately in -80 C or liquid nitrogen. Bloodwas drawn from the patients and controls at least two different time pointswithin three months of each other . . .11 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach13fn_428]For a twenty-four hour turn-around requested by Science, the researchersbelieved it was a thorough job, with very minor editing mistakes.In the third paragraph the team should have written that, “The CFS patients weremainly from the United States,” although the sentences following that onedetailed the country of origin for each sample. There was also some confusionover the number of control samples, whether it was 320 or 218. The quick answerwas that the original number of controls provided by the lab was 320, but whentrying to age and gender match the samples, this number was winnowed down to218.These were not grievous errors given their quick reply, and easily correctable.The increasingly-scrutinizing attitude by the senior editor at Science was allthe more puzzling to Mikovits and her team, since their paper was probably oneof the most thoroughly vetted papers ever published by the journal. It had notonly undergone peer-review, but was the subject of an all-day pre-publicationconference of the world’s leading experts on retrovirology as well as the focusof another, smaller conference attended by Frank Ruscetti a month earlier,almost a scientific hazing atop a peer review.Mikovits reached out to a leading immunologist and advisor for the WPI on thepaper and the antibody assay. She’d relayed her suspicion that Science wouldbegin attacking the research because of the way they were handling the lettersof complaint, so when the critical letter came from Science, Dr. Mikovitsforwarded it to the advisor with the declaration, “Right on cue!”He emailed back barely an hour after Mikovits had received the email fromScience and told her to “[C]larify the writing and numbers; stick to what is inthe paper.”12 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach13fn_429] It was good advice andMikovits followed it.* * *The first negative study was published in the open-access Journal PLOS-One(Public Library of Science) and involved researchers from Englandlong-associated with a psychiatric explanation for ME/CFS such as thepreviously-mentioned Simon Wessely, who preferred to call ME/CFS a functionalsomatic syndrome, rather than “mass hysteria.”The Wessely research was even partially funded by the South London and MaudsleyNHS Foundation Trust/Institute of Psychiatry National Institute of HealthBiomedical Research Centre. Compared to those for Science, the standards forpublication in PLOS-One were relaxed. The work of Mikovits and her team wassubmitted to Science on May 4, 2009, the referee comments were received June 6,a resubmission made in early July, an NIH Conference held to discuss thefindings in late July, an official acceptance issued on August 31, followed bymore than a month of editing during which a full third of the paper was cut, andit was not published until October 8, 2009, five months after the initialsubmission.In stark contrast to this lengthy review process, the first negative study onXMRV was submitted on Tuesday, December 1, 2009, and accepted and published byPLOS-One on Friday, December 4, 2009,13 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach13fn_430]somewhere around seventy-two hours.Within just a couple more months, another negative paper on XMRV and ME/CFS waspublished in Retrovirology in February 2010. It was also from the UnitedKingdom, from the laboratory of Dr. Kate Bishop.Bishop and her team studied two cohorts of ME/CFS patients from the UK to lookfor the presence of viral nucleic acids by using a PCR assay for XMRV gag geneand the presence of serological responses using a viral neutralization. Noassociation was found in that study between XMRV and CFS, while considerablecross reactivity was found in the serological assay.The next negative paper came from the Netherlands and used samples that had beengathered from patients between December 1991 and April 1992: it was published inthe British Medical Journal.14 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach13fn_431] The methodthe Dutch used was a “real time polymerase chain reaction assay targeting theXMRV integrase gene and/or a nested polymerase chain reaction targeting the XMRVgag gene.”The researchers found “no XMRV sequences in any of the patients or controls ineither of the assays.” The authors noted in their conclusion, “we found noevidence for a role of XMRV in the cause of CFS in Dutch patients. Over the pastdecades we have seen a series of papers prematurely claiming the discovery ofthe microbial cause of CFS. Regrettably, thus far none of these claims have beensubstantiated.”15 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach13fn_432]Mikovits was particularly concerned about the last paper since her team hadestablished a collaborative research agreement with the Netherlands researchers.The Netherlands group had in fact found positives, and Mikovits’s team confirmedthe positives, but when the paper was published there was no mention of thepositive samples.The researchers never reported their positive findings because they had alteredtheir PCR procedures to make the assay more stringent (less likely to pick upclosely-related virus strains or non-specific results, thus narrowing theprobability of any positives).Mikovits considered this scientific selectivity to be unfair. It was the relaxedstringency, which had allowed the retrovirus to be identified in the firstplace. They didn’t have a good handle on what it was, but they knew what wasclose to it.* * *Mikovits believed best way to characterize these three studies was to say thatthey were unable to find XMRV in those with ME/CFS or healthy controls usingSilverman’s VP-62 plasmid as the gold standard. This was frustrating to Mikovitsas she had given several slide presentations around the world and saidspecifically that researchers needed to be looking for more than the VP-62sequence, because there could be others.It was time for Mikovits and her team to mount their response.* * *Mikovits and her team addressed the challenge of responding to the negativestudies as well as some positive findings that had come out in the researchliterature.Their response paper was entitled, “Distribution of Xenotropic Murine LeukemiaVirus-Related Virus (XMRV) Infection in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and ProstateCancer” and was soon published in the AIDS Review,16[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach13fn_433] a venue where researchers had alreadyendured a complicated and conflict-laden history around HIV.The explanation for the negative studies revolved around four potentialarguments.First, there might be differences in the geographical distribution of XMRV.Ruscetti’s human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) exhibited was relativelyeasy to find among Japanese populations, but less so in other Asian countries,and exceedingly rare in regions outside of Asia. Maybe XMRV was largely confinedto the United States, the way borrelia burgdorferi was the commonly acceptedcause of Lyme disease in the US, whereas borrelia garinii was more common incertain parts of Europe.Second, PCR data (which was used by all three negative studies) is particularlysensitive to sequence variation. Therefore, if the viral sequence waswell-characterized and the regions which were conserved and did not changemarkedly as the virus evolved, then PCR was a good diagnostic tool. At the time,however, the genetic variation between different XMRV sequences was about 0.03percent, even though they were obtained from geographically distant areas. Thisvariation was even smaller than the differences observed in HTLV-1, a virus thatdid not appear to exhibit much sequence difference. Thus, there was not enoughknown about the sequence variation to determine whether these regions werewell-conserved or not, so PCR was not necessarily reliable.Third, the question of whether individuals infected with XMRV had the ability toform antibodies to the viral proteins was still unanswered. While their researchhad suggested patients did form antibodies to XMRV, it was still too early touse this as a reliable test (and it required the use of the spleen-focus formingantibody test as an analog). As previously noted, an antibody response could beblunted by a compromised immunity.Fourth, and perhaps most significant, the clinical criteria used by the variousresearchers varied dramatically, a major point given the vast arguments over thevagueness of some case definitions of ME/CFS, which easily could include casesof (extremely common) idiopathic “chronic fatigue” caused by unrelated issuessuch as heart failure or overwork.Patients with ME/CFS had argued for years to judge them with more stringentdiagnostic standards, so they would not be lumped in with people who were simplyovertired who suffered from an obviously different ailment.The Canadian Consensus Criteria—after much lobbying from patients anddoctors—had thus become the gold international standard for defining the ME/CFSpopulation, as it relied not just on physical symptoms, but also highlymeasurable and clinical and immunological data.17[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach13fn_434]Mikovits and her team had used the Canadian Consensus Criteria as well asabnormal chemokine and cytokine markers to more clearly define the populationand weed out unrelated illness, while other studies had seemed carelesslyunconcerned with distinguishing between ME/CFS and generalized, idiopathicfatigue.While the negative studies were getting the most press, other research had alsobeen conducted during this time that supported the findings of Mikovits et al.Researchers from Germany had found XMRV sequences in the respiratory tractsecretions of 2–3 percent of healthy donors and 10 percent in immune compromiseddonors.18 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach13fn_435] The clear implication from theGerman research was that the immune status of individuals might be an importantfactor in XMRV detection.The argument Mikovits and her team made was that their paper was not simply “asurvey of CFS using PCR or a search for antibodies to XMRV proteins” in a poorlydefined group of patients. They had used several different assays for thepresence of XMRV nucleic acids, proteins, and infectious virus.The research might still be challenged, but if disproving the findings involveda direct replication of the testing done by the Mikovits team, it had not beenaccomplished.* * *In February 2010, Mikovits flew with the Whittemores to Washington, DC, to visitwith Senator Harry Reid.19 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach13fn_436] They spent thenight at the historic Hay-Adams Hotel, just across from Lafayette Square, with aview of the White House. The hotel was founded by John Hay, a former secretaryto Abraham Lincoln, and Henry Adams, an acclaimed author and descendent offather and son US presidents, John Adams and John Quincy Adams.The Whittemores and Mikovits managed to check in just before an ice storm hitthe region. The storm left the trees latticed with ice, and when Mikovitsstepped outside into the cold the next morning, she noted the absolute quietthat had blanketed the capitol city.The ice storm had closed most of official Washington, but that didn’t deter thegroup from making their way to the Office of the Senate Majority Leader. Theywere on a mission to get funding for the planned institute and see if they couldget it designated as a “national center of excellence,” which would make it mucheasier to obtain federal grants.The Whittemore’s lobbyist, Alan Freemeyer, drove them to meet with Harry Reid.On the way, Freemeyer had a special stop planned for them. As they drove,Mikovits thought the neighborhood looked familiar. They pulled up to a house,and it clicked.“This is my grandfather’s house!” she exclaimed happily, suddenly flooded withnostalgic memories. “Where my mother was born and where my grandfather died ofcancer!” Freemeyer pulled the car over and Dr. Mikovits stepped out onto thesidewalk.She remembered all the times she’d gone there, the times she’d listened tobaseball on the radio with her grandfather, and when he’d been too sick fromcancer to listen. In that very house, she had made the decision to fight thedisease that was stealing her beloved grandfather away. She knew she hadmentioned the address, 417 Constitution Avenue, to the Whittemores in herstories about her grandfather, but didn’t think they’d been listening thatclosely.But they had, and they were honoring her by remembering it, and taking her tothe location so she could recall the young girl who so desperately wanted tofend off her grandfather’s death. That young girl still lived inside Mikovits,and now she was going to visit one of the most powerful men in the country. Shehad come full circle, fulfilling the promise she’d made in that very house.The Office of the Senate Majority Leader was almost overwhelming to Mikovits. Itwas elegant and radiated centuries of power. Portraits of John F. Kennedy,Andrew Jackson, and Mark Twain (whose wife “Livy” Clemens had suffered from“neurasthenia,” prompting Twain to write about his beloved, “She was alwaysfrail in body and she lived upon her spirit, whose hopefulness and courage wereindestructible”20 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach13fn_437]) hung on the walls.The office was appointed with large wingback leather chairs, dark mahoganytables, the seal of the Senate, and pictures of the Senator with various worlddignitaries. As the group sat down to speak with the Senator, a large firecrackled in his private fireplace.Reid inquired after Andrea’s health with his typical concern, before they allturned to Mikovits. She began by talking about her background, her experienceculturing HTLV-1, her doctoral work on HIV latency, the years she’d spent at theNCI biological response modifiers program and in the screening technologiesbranch of the division of cancer treatment, and determining which compounds anddrugs might be helpful in treatment for AIDS associated malignancies.The recent publication of the Science article was what really held his interest,and how the WPI could be designated a center of excellence, to make it easier toobtain federal funding.The momentum seemed swifter than it had ever been.Mikovits mentioned how she had become aware of ME/CFS, the estimated seventeenmillion people worldwide and one million in the United States who suffered fromthe condition, and the hellish day-to-day experience they endured. Senator Reideased back into his chair, a finger at his lips, his eyes watching intently.She knew the look.It was one of active interest; and while he might not be following all of herpoints, she was convincing him of her expertise for the task of conquering thisillness that was known to be more common than HIV, lung cancer, and breastcancer in women (with no small number in men and children as well): a nationalepidemic.When she was finished, Senator Reid’s eyes darted to Harvey, then Annette. Hesaid he saw why this was so important and wanted to help in any way he could.Reid’s staff could help with any details. What more could any researcher wantthan to have the support of the most powerful man in Congress?* * *Mikovits was about to enter the most perilous phase of her professional career,and by late May and early June of 2010 it would come to be viewed as the timewhen angels and devils revealed themselves.The publication of her article in Science put Mikovits at the top of the list ofspeakers for the fifth Invest in ME Conference in London on May 24, 2010, andshe was slated to be the final speaker for the day.21[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach13fn_438] When she had attended the year before,she’d been blown away by the keynote address of journalist Hillary Johnson withher speech, “The Why,” that recounted in vivid detail not just what it felt liketo have ME/CFS, but the manipulation and mismanagement of the disease by the CDCstarting with the 1984–1985 Incline Village outbreak.A year after that conference, Mikovits had become friends with Johnson and sheshared with the journalist much of the inside drama of what had taken placesince the publication of the Science paper. The paper had come under some attackfrom the negative studies, but researchers at the conference were stillenthusiastic about XMRV and what it might mean for the treatment of ME/CFS.During the conference Mikovits and Annette Whittemore got the opportunity tohave several long talks with Cheney about the research. Cheney had more of aresearch bent than Peterson and the theory of a retroviral origin for ME/CFScould reasonably be credited to him during his early presence at the 1984–1985Incline Village outbreak. He had also worked with Dr. Elaine DeFreitas, who inthe 1990s had published evidence of a retrovirus in the disease, but then hadcome under vicious attack.A 1996 Newsweek review of Johnson’s book Osler’s Web depicted the eerie déjà vuof an “arrogant” CDC that seemed capable of unfairly skewing retroviralreplication studies on ME/CFS again in the future: “. . . when the CDC publishesa paper saying it has been unable to replicate her findings, her supportevaporates. By early 1995, the saga has cost [Dr. Paul] Cheney and [Dr. David]Bell their marriages, and a regretful DeFreitas fears her career as a scientistis finished. The book closes with the image of an infectious disease spreadingunchecked as an arrogant medical establishment looks the other way.”22[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach13fn_439]Cheney had long ago parted ways with Peterson and moved to North Carolina toopen his own practice, while also devoting a significant amount of time toresearch. Mikovits was impressed with Cheney’s intelligence. The WPI was lookingfor a medical director, as they’d long planned to open a treatment center inAugust of 2010. Peterson had resigned earlier that spring.That left an opening for a medical director, one who could step in andimmediately understand the complexities of the disease as well as the patientpopulation. Cheney expressed interest in the position, assuming they were ableto get the clinic up and running.For Mikovits, landing somebody with Cheney’s background, intelligence, andcredentials was a coup after what had been a rough couple of months. They weregoing to win this fight and offer hope to beleaguered patients. Cheney had beenthere for the beginning of the battle, and they all planned to keep fighting.* * *A reporter for the Chicago Tribune, Trine Tsouderos, contacted the WPI afterlearning that Mikovits was scheduled to speak at the AutismOne Conference inChicago. This was the same event Nobel Prize winner, Luc Montagnier, wouldattend two years later, leading to a scientific reprimand by his old rival,Robert Gallo.The Whittemores discussed the merits of Mikovits responding to Tsouderos withthe WPI public relations company. They decided that Tsouderos could submit herquestions in writing, Mikovits would answer them, and then the public relationsconsultants would review them before sending them back to Tsouderos.But after hearing that Paul Cheney was willing to come on board as medicaldirector, and having spent her life as a scientist telling the truth as best shesaw it, Mikovits decided to email Tsouderos directly from the plane from London.Trine Tsouderos was not held in high regard among many of the regular attendeesof the annual AutismOne Convention in Chicago. Many years around the time of theconference articles by her would be published, questioning some new therapy orresearch being investigated by the autism parents. The larger questions of whatmight be causing the disease or whether the federal response to the epidemic wasadequate, rarely found their way into her articles.Prior to working for the Chicago Tribune, Tsouderos wrote for People magazine.She later left the Chicago Tribune in September of 2012 to become the HealthcareMedia Director for Golin Harris International, a communications firm, servingsuch clients as Dow Chemical, GlaxoSmithKline, and Merck Pharmaceuticals.23[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach13fn_440]To Dr. Mikovits it seemed as if Tsouderos had already written the article in herhead prior to even speaking with her. The article ran in the June 7, 2010,edition of the Tribune. Entitled “Hope Outrunning Science on Chronic FatigueSyndrome,” it painted a picture of Mikovits as an out-of-control scientist:Mikovits said she accepted an invitation to speak at AutismOne to help sound thealarm. She accused researchers and government agencies of being more interestedin previously published research linking XMRV and a form of prostate cancer thanin her work . . .So research dollars will go for XMRV infected men with cancer but not women withCFS,” she wrote in an email. “(This) left me no recourse but to play the autismcard! Will they ignore the children too?24 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach13fn_441]Mikovits was known for not mincing words, but she’d never perceived herself as apublic figure before. In the right context, such outspokenness could shakepeople up and mobilize them to create change.But in the fray of a politically sensitive scientific discovery, withramifications that reverberated out to cancer, ME/CFS, multiple sclerosis, andthe nuclear issue of autism and vaccines, such outspokenness could cause acataclysm.* * *While in Chicago, Mikovits and Harvey Whittemore met with Dr. Marcus Conant, awell-known AIDS researcher and Dr. Joseph Burrascano, a Lyme disease specialist,to discuss putting them in touch with a wealthy benefactor who owned adiagnostic company and was interested in developing an XMRV diagnostic test.25[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach13fn_442] Conant was a legend in the AIDS community,having first identified Kaposi’s Sarcoma in AIDS patients as an associateprofessor at UCSF, then developing some of the most used HIV medications andhelping to found the San Francisco AIDS Foundation which had served as a steadyanchor through the darkest years of the AIDS epidemic.As an advocate, he was the successful lead plaintiff in a case that claimed theFirst Amendment protected the right of physicians to recommend the use ofmedical marijuana to people living with HIV and AIDS. Burrascano, as an experton Lyme and tick-borne coinfections, had testified before Congress on his areasof expertise.At one point in the meeting, a call came in on Harvey’s cell phone. He listenedfor a few moments and then exclaimed, “She did what?” Tsouderos had apparentlyshared with the WPI what she was planning to publish and the WPI was going intooverdrive to try and limit the damage.Though apologetic, Mikovits felt the entire situation was unfair, that sheshould be able to talk freely, that it was an absolute necessity for scientificinvestigation and most scientists did not come under this level of scrutiny. Yetshe also knew that it was reasonable to vet public comments through their PRfirm.Harvey said, “We love you, warts and all, Judy. But don’t talk to anybodywithout our permission.”* * *When Mikovits first made her plans to speak at AutismOne, shortly after she’dspoken at the Defeat Autism Now! conference in January of 2010, there had notbeen much media attention on her. As the spotlight increased, Annette expressedmisgivings about Mikovits going to AutismOne. They discussed it and Mikovitssaid she was going because she had given her word.Even though Mikovits planned to go with the full knowledge of Harvey andAnnette, they tried to limit her exposure there. Normally at AutismOne, everytalk was recorded and the entire conference then placed on a DVD so that parentsand professionals could review it. Her talk would not be recorded.Hillary Johnson accompanied her to the conference and together they walked thehalls and commented on what they saw. They both felt that the community ofparents in autism were much better organized than the ME/CFS patient community.But they also agreed the research conducted on autism was woefully lacking.Mikovits’s talk was on the program at the same time as another presentation bythe editors and writers for the website Age of Autism, founded by Dan Olmsted,who had been an editor for twenty-five years with United Press International aswell as USA Today, and Mark Blaxill, a Harvard MBA who ran his own consultingcompany.One of the writers for Age of Autism, this book’s coauthor Kent Heckenlively,had become interested in the XMRV story from the autism angle and had talked toMikovits several times.* * *“Welcome to the Rebel Alliance,” Dan Olmsted said in his opening remarks,referencing Star Wars, then introduced the various editors and writers for Ageof Autism. The small room was packed, so after he stood up in front of the groupof about three hundred, Heckenlively raced out of the room to Mikovits’spresentation, where the audience of some thirty spectators was dwarfed by acavernous ballroom.Heckenlively listened to the talk, then joined the small group of people huddledaround Mikovits to ask questions. As he waited for his chance to talk toMikovits, Heckenlively saw something that set off warning bells in his head.Hillary Johnson was wearing a press badge for Discover magazine. In January themagazine had published its “100 Top Stories of 2009.” The research linking XMRVto ME/CFS was ranked a respectable #55.26 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach13fn_443]The #1 science news story of 2009, according to Discover magazine—ahead of stemcells, swine flu, or even the discovery of the first Earth-like planet orbitinganother star—was “Vaccine Phobia Becomes a Public Health Threat.”27[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach13fn_444]For parents like Heckenlively, who had seen their children regress into autismafter a vaccination, the wholesale dismissal of their observations as a “phobia”was like waving a red cape in front of an angry bull. He immediately feltcombative toward Johnson, briefly considering grabbing her by the scruff of theneck and tossing her out of the nearest exit, but when he introduced himself,she surprised him saying, “Oh, you’re one of the people I’d been hoping to meethere!”She said before the conference she had reviewed the articles on Age of Autismand had come away thinking that the two people she wanted to meet were KatieWright, the woman whose parents had founded Autism Speaks, and him.“I thought you’d be the best person to understand XMRV in the autism community,”Johnson told the stunned Heckenlively.* * *“You know they’re going to come after you, don’t you?” Heckenlively said toMikovits at dinner that night with Johnson.Mikovits explained that she had taken precautions by gathering strong scientificand political support and that new findings that upset old paradigms were oftenthe subject of heated attacks. She felt safe keeping her nose to the grindstoneand focusing on science.“But you talked about autism and vaccines,” he answered. “You’ve got yet anotherbull’s-eye on your back. No offense to your XMRV discovery, but it was story #55in Discover magazine’s top 100 stories of 2009 and told with neutral language.The anti-vaccine parents were #1. In their eyes we’re the same enemy.”“I really haven’t joined the anti-vaccine campaign,” she protested. “I thinkvaccines have by and large been a good thing, it’s just that in some people theymay have negative effects.”“That’s what we all say at first,” continued Heckenlively. “We say we understandthat vaccines have done wonderful things, but may cause problems in a‘sub-group’ of people. We politely ask, ‘won’t you please look at this questionso we can continue to vaccinate safely?’ Then we got attacked for being‘anti-science’ when all we wanted was more science for our kids. I have a childwho can’t speak and I want answers.”Heckenlively told the story of his own children. His daughter, Jacqueline, hadbeen born without complications and developed normally for the first six monthsof life. She’d gone off of breast milk at six months, starting a cow’s milkbased formula and a few weeks later got her six-month series of shots. Duringthis time she also had a series of ear infections and received six rounds ofantibiotic treatments. The decline in her had been gradual, and she wasn’tdiagnosed with a seizure disorder until about four months later.“I’d heard about the vaccine theory for problems with these kids around thattime,” Heckenlivey continued, “It just seemed so unbelievable. I actuallyremember telling people, ‘shit happens’ and that unfortunately somethingterrible had simply happened to my daughter with her seizures and autism. Thencame my son, Ben, and he made me a believer.”Ben was born without complications and from the very start was so active he wasnicknamed, “Busy Ben.” Heckenlively’s wife’s family had a history of milkallergies and amidst all of the problems with Jacqueline they uncovered a milkallergy.When Ben went off breast milk, his parents gave him a hypoallergenic milkformula until he was about fifteen months old. But it was expensive and sincetheir son was doing so well, they figured it didn’t justify the extra cost.Heckenlively’s voice became softer and more intense as he continued Ben’s story.“I took Ben to his eighteen month checkup in early January. I’d given thepediatrician hell, because I thought she might have missed something at mydaughter’s six-month checkup years earlier. They were on the lookout forproblems with my kids, so they put Ben through an entire developmentalmilestones series of tests. He passed with flying colors. He had fifteen ortwenty words, looked at the doctor, and was very engaged. They gave him hisshots and we left.”Within a few days of getting vaccinated, Ben became mute.On Martin Luther King Day in 2001, Kent was in a bookstore and ran across thebook, Unraveling the Mystery of Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorder byKaryn Seroussi. The book presented the theory that a diet free of wheat anddairy (gluten and casein) might help children with autism and otherdevelopmental disorders. Both Ben and Jacqueline went on the diet the followingday. For Jacqueline it did little, but for Ben it had a profound effect. Benstarted the diet within five days of going mute, and after seven days of thediet he spoke his first word again.“I’ll never forget it as long as I live,” Heckenlively told the two women. “Wewere outside the Nordstrom’s department store in Walnut Creek, where there’s asmall fountain and a pillar with a lion’s head on each side with water comingout of the lion’s mouth into the small pool. Ben was fascinated by this streamof water going into the pool. He looked like he was focusing all of hisattention, everything he had inside of him, and then he just said, ‘Bubbles!’ Hekept saying it again and again, and my wife and I were laughing and encouraginghim to keep saying it and he did.”Heckenlively related how his wife, Linda, a speech therapist trained in thesteps of language acquisition, observed in the months that followed as Benslowly regained the language he had lost. It took about a year for him to catchup with his developmental age for speech, and about two years for what seemed tobe a painful sound sensitivity to subside, but by the time he startedkindergarten he was just like any neurotypical kid.“I was able to reverse something in my son that I wasn’t able to do with mydaughter. She’s twelve years-old now and can’t speak. Someday I want to have aconversation with her. That’s why I’m doing all of this.”“You will have that conversation someday,” Mikovits reassured him.“Promise?” said Heckenlively.“Yes.”“Okay, I’m going to hold you to it, doc. Someday I will have a conversation withmy daughter.”For Heckenlively it was all so clear. Even though she didn’t fully realize it,Mikovits had already joined the Rebel Alliance.* * *The next day, Hillary Johnson and Kent Heckenlively met for breakfast.Heckenlively thought it hilarious that the same Discover magazine that had“Vaccine-Phobia” as its number one science story of the previous year would sendsuch a sympathetic journalist to the AutismOne Conference who would seek himout.Johnson told Heckenlively that some people with ME/CFS also traced the onset oftheir symptoms to a vaccination, just as Andrea Whittemore had traced herrelapse to the MMR shot required before she could start at the University ofNevada, Reno.Heckenlively wondered how he could talk so candidly about these issues with aworld-famous scientist like Mikovits and a top-notch journalist like Johnson,while the press seemed to take an almost ghoulish delight in painting theparents as fanatics and the scientists as the voices of reason?* * *While Mikovits understood why Heckenlively might be worried about her future,there were a few things he didn’t know that made her believe things would soonmove in a more positive direction. Something that could be cited as evidence ofpossible contamination in the XMRV study was the lack of sequence diversitybetween known isolates of the virus.The less diversity in the virus, the more likely studies using the Silvermanstrain were subject to contamination. But Frank Ruscetti’s collaborator at theNCI, Dr. Kathy Jones, the scientist who replaced Mikovits when she leftRuscetti’s lab to head the Lab Of Antiviral Drug Mechanisms, had been doing workon the sequence diversity of the virus. They were finding different strains ofthe virus and greater diversity than they had seen previously. “Diversity is ourfriend,” Mikovits and Ruscetti would often say to each other.The same weekend Mikovits attended the AutismOne Conference, the Cold SpringsHarbor Conference on Retrovirology, where presentations on XMRV a year earlierhad caused the NCI to hold the invitation-only meeting to discuss public healththreat of XMRV, was held.At the Cold Springs Harbor conference, Jones discovered another group, led byDr. Harvey Alter, chief of the Infectious Disease Section in the Department ofInfectious Disease at the National Institutes of Health, and his collaborator,Dr. Shyh-Ching Lo, had been doing similar research. Alter was best known for hisdiscovery of the hepatitis C virus, for which he received both the DistinguishedService Medal (the highest award that can be given to civilians working in theUS government), and the Lasker Award for clinical medical research. The Alter/Lopaper showed significantly more sequence variation in XMRV than had previouslybeen reported, thus lowering the possibility that the findings of Mikovits andher team were due to contamination. They were finally being backed by solidsupporters.Kathy Jones learned that Alter and Lo’s study had already been submitted to theProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Although Jones felt her ownpaper had more data about the sequence variation, it would be good politics tolet Alter and Lo publish their findings first since they had no ties to theoriginal XMRV study.If all things went as planned, Alter and Lo’s paper would come out within a fewweeks of the Cold Springs Harbor meeting.Back at the WPI, Mikovits hosted Marcus Conant, the AIDS doctor. As an AIDSveteran, Conant was known for forceful advocacy and would later tell thoseworking in ME/CFS that they needed to proactively create their own luck withoutwaiting for either the press or the government to understand their work.Conant shared with Mikovits his hope and determination that XMRV would not besubject to the same government indifference that held back HIV/AIDS research forseveral years. Conant strongly believed that Mikovits should get a lawyer toprotect herself and the WPI against legal challenges, which were likely to startflying. Those who had been on the front lines of the AIDS fight had come toexpect heavy adversity.Conant had an attorney in mind, a man around seventy years old like himself, andhe picked up the phone with Mikovits present. “Hey buddy!” Conant said. “What ifI were to tell you this scenario? Some researchers found a virus and thegovernment says it doesn’t exist, yet they have a serology test that candistinguish it and prove it’s there. What would that sound like to you?”Even though she couldn’t hear his answer, the bemused expression on Conant’sface told her what the answer had been.The new discovery sounded just like HIV/AIDS."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURTEENThe Long, Hot Confirmation Summer of 2010The FDA and the NIH have independently confirmed the XMRV findings as publishedin Science, October[2009]. The confirmation was issued by Dr. Harvey Alter ofthe NIH during a closed workshop on blood transfusion held on May 26–27 inZagreb. . . .The association with CFS is very strong, but causality not proved. XMRV andrelated MLVs are in the donor supply with a prevalence of 3% and 7%. We (FDA &NIH) have independently confirmed the Lombardi group findings.1[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach14fn_445]—ORTHO, a Dutch magazine for health professionals.“Your lives are about to become more interesting,” Frank Ruscetti wrote to studyauthors Drs. Harvey Alter and Shyh-Ching Lo on June 23, 2010.2[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach14fn_446]It’s difficult to overstate the importance of a confirmatory study by highlyqualified and well-respected leaders in the field, such as Alter of the NIH andLo of the Food and Drug Administration. A positive confirmatory study simplyreplicated original findings, therefore bolstering their legitimacy. In thiscase, it would mean that the scientific community would accept that XMRV or arelated retrovirus had a natural history of infection in humans, with greaternumbers among people with ME/CFS as compared to healthy controls. Even if therewere further negative studies, the scientific community at large would accept anassociation. The more specific issue of causation would be a question for futurestudies.Ruscetti, Lo, Alter, and Mikovits would be stunned at the twists and turns thatthe confirmation study would take in the next few months, politely summarized byLo’s rather cryptic response to Ruscetti a few weeks later: “We thought ourresults very much support your earlier findings, although there were apparentvariations in sequences. Unfortunately, our situation has become morecomplicated. We are facing various challenges and uncertainties.”3[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach14fn_447]* * *Within a few days of the Science publication, Mikovits received a call from Dr.Michael Busch.4 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach14fn_448] He was professional, calm,and courteous, and said it was of critical importance that the blood supply beprotected. The disaster of HIV/AIDS in the blood supply infecting thousands ofindividuals who received blood transfusions was still a vivid memory for manyscientists.Busch, an MD with a PhD in experimental pathology,5[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach14fn_449] was a professor of laboratory medicine atthe University of California, San Francisco, as well as the head of the BloodSystems Research Institute (BSRI), which in 2012 The Scientist listed as one ofthe “Top 10 Best Places to Work in Academia.”Thus they quickly assembled the Blood XMRV Scientific Research Working Group(SRWG, in this text called the “Blood Working Group” for clarity), whichincluded Mikovits, Ruscetti, Busch, John Coffin, as well as William Switzer fromthe CDC, determined that their work should go in phases. They needed to designassays for XMRV capable of testing for its presence in the blood supply.Typically these assays would use PCR (polymerase chain reaction testing) and beconducted on serum or plasma, rather than using the laborious testing done bythe Mikovits team.Mikovits worried about viral latency. Other viruses, including herpes virusesand HTLV-1, would not appear in blood tests (such as PCR) on infectedindividuals, becoming detectable only after the patient developed cold sores orimmune deficiencies. Mikovits was concerned that XMRV might fly under the radarin a similar way.She and the team came up with additional techniques that made it possible tomore easily find the virus: if they let the blood set inside a biologicalcontainment hood for a day or two, the cells would die and release nucleic acidsinto the plasma, which could be more easily extracted, allowing them to testmore accurately for the virus. To address the concern more thoroughly, she andanother member of the BSRI and the Blood Working Group (BWG) wrote a grantproposal to study latency in the virus.Among the concerns Mikovits had about the Blood Working Group was the growingsize of the committee due to the inclusion of some members for politicalreasons, even though they might not have the requisite expertise. This was notabout XMRV in ME/CFS, it was about XMRV in the greater blood supply.After the Blood Working Group decided on the assays that would be used, theywould set to work determining whether the virus could be detected in bloodsupply. What happened next would create serious doubt in the minds of Mikovitsand Ruscetti as to whether those in charge at the CDC were truly interested inunbiased testing of XMRV in the blood supply, even with public health at stake.* * *After the publication of their paper by Science, the laboratories of Mikovitsand Ruscetti kept working on sequencing isolates of XMRVs, revealing straindifferences, independent of the Silverman lab.The initial sequencing done by the Silverman lab indicated that various isolatesdidn’t vary more than 0.03 percent, a curious result and one which couldindicate a lab contaminant rather than a virus with a history of naturalinfection in humans. The antibody and protein findings still argued that thevirus was a human infection, but genetic diversity greater than 0.03 percentwould have been stronger evidence of independent infections.Ruscetti’s lab at the NCI kept pursuing sequencing work, though, and eventuallyidentified three genetically distinct strains of the virus, which according tostandard classification practice, Mikovits had named strains A, B, and C. Thework suggested a genetic difference of about 1–2 percent between the strains,but even that was a well-informed guess.6 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach14fn_450]Of the less than 8,000 estimated base pairs in the virus, they’d only been ableto sequence about 300 base pairs of the gag protein and 600 base pairs of theenvelope, or about 10 percent of the complete virus. Still, a 1–2 percentgenetic difference between strains of XMRV is what they could expect for a mouserelated-retrovirus, which generally would not show much more genetic diversitythan that. These sequences were similar to those Lo/Alter were about to publish.Mikovits was in charge of sample selection for BSRI phases two and three.Mikovits had arranged for the WPI study coordinator and phlebotomist to drawthree fresh samples from subjects who had one of the various strains, and anegative control sample, and send them off to BSRI for distribution to thetesting sites, including to the WPI, to Bill Switzer of the CDC, and to the NCIlab directed by John Coffin.Mikovits chose the study participants with great care. Two were from patientswho were local to the Reno area and tested positive in multiple assays onmultiple occasions. The third positive sample was taken from a subject whoseblood had been put under an electron microscope to reveal a clear picture of agamma-retroviral particle budding from the cellular membrane. Study participantswith variant sequences were included. The fourth sample was from a lab workerwho had never been in Reno and had not worked with any of the samples.The tests done at the CDC and WPI confirmed their research: all three patientsamples, positive, negative control sample, negative.When John Coffin heard this, on a conference call with other members of theBlood Working Group, he went ballistic. “That’s not a well-done study! You’resimply contaminating everything! We need to do a phase two (b)!” he thundered.7[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach14fn_451]Mikovits directly challenged Switzer in an email she sent on June 27, 2010,which also went to the other members of the Blood Working Group, stating“Please also note that I sent 8–10 confirmed XMRV positive patients plasma toBill Switzer in September 09 and he failed to detect XMRV in any of them whileIla Singh correctly identified XMRV in the exact same sample set. Clearly theclinical sensitivities of the assays were the difference.”8[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach14fn_452]Instead of using less stringent PCR conditions, which had allowed Mikovits tofind sequences closely related to Silverman’s XMRV sequences, the CDC switchedto more stringent PCR conditions for calling a sequence a positive, and alsoadded the requirement of finding sequences for envelope and polymerase, otherviral proteins.Switzer served on the Blood Working Group, but was concurrently doing his ownindependent research for the CDC trying to show that the absence of XMRV inME/CFS was correct. For the CDC, the virus had to be the sequence of XMRVSilverman, the VP62 plasmid, or else there was no infection. Four days afterMikovits’s email, Switzer would publish his negative XMRV study inRetrovirology, while the positive study of Drs. Alter and Lo would be held up bythe Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences for six more weeks.* * *“Although we will almost certainly continue to accumulate low-hanging fruit,where simple relationships will be found between the presence of a cultivableagent and a disease, these successes will be increasingly infrequent. The futureof the field rests instead in our ability to follow footprints of infectiousagents that cannot be characterized using classical microbiological techniquesand to develop the laboratory and computational infrastructure required todissect complex host-microbe interactions.”9[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach14fn_453]This was how in 2011 Ian Lipkin described the problems inherent in discoveringand identifying new pathogens with established techniques. There was a need tobranch out to methods that involved more sleuthing, “following footprints,” andusing different methods for catching elusive prey.Mikovits and her team had been quite adept at identifying the “footprints,” andthrough their electron micrograph they’d even captured a picture of the beast.But for Coffin and the CDC, it wasn’t enough. They wanted the footprints, thebeast, and its DNA, which identified only one very dubious species. Even if theydiscovered the body of a slightly different beast, it would be as if no beastexisted.Unbeknown to all at this time, this beast was quite unusual. What Mikovits wouldlater come to refer to as XMRV Silverman, (or, more precisely, the VP62 clone hehad stitched together from various sequences), was a laboratory recombination, avirus which didn’t actually exist in nature, but would produce viral RNA tohigher titers than HIV in human cell lines in vitro and it could jump to celllines in tissue culture hoods.A virus with no natural history of infection would be their standard. This wasnot a virus that had been cultured from an actual human subject, as Mikovits hasno doubt she had done, but one which had been created in a lab, and that theyhoped was the same as was found in nature.* * *The major problem, which Mikovits had started to publicly identify as early asthe May 2010 Invest in ME Conference in London, was that Silverman had notisolated the virus as done in classic retrovirology, but had simply created aninfectious molecular clone (a copy of the complete viral genome made bylaboratory techniques).To many, this was the same thing as isolating an actual virus from a patient,but for those trained in more classical virology, the absence of confirmationusing other retrovirological techniques could be a recipe for disaster. Mikovitsknew about the process of creating an infectious molecular clone, having donesome of the pioneering work in the field while a postdoc at the Derse lab andcreating the first infectious molecular clone for Ruscetti and Poiesz’s HTLV-1.In Mikovits’s mind, relying on an infectious molecular clone rather than anisolated and sequenced virus from an actual human subject was simply poorscience. The more traditional investigative techniques for retroviruses involveddetermining whether reverse transcriptase (the enzyme by which an RNA virusconverts its genetic code to DNA and inserts itself into the genome) waspresent, then culturing and transmitting the suspected infectious virus, thenusing PCR to get the sequence data.But mistakes and misconceptions are a common part of science. Some of thegreatest discoveries in science had started out as errors due to misconceptionsand unknown exotic biology which presented curious and unsuspected aspects tothe research.The question few seemed willing to consider was whether something very similarbut not identical to XMRV Silverman actually did exist in patients with ME/CFSand other neuroimmune disorders, and whether it could be properly hunted.Although it may seem somewhat ironic given Lipkin’s need for scientists to movebeyond “classical microbiological techniques,” Mikovits and her team had alwaysbeen taught to use that approach. Mikovits had approached the question bycombining classic microbiological techniques of viral isolation andtransmission, electron microscopy, serology, protein detection, and PCR, as away to support each other. She treated each of these methods as complementary,revealing different and changing facets of an immune system under apparentattack.Mikovits believed that Coffin and the CDC seemed to be using these techniques inan exclusionary manner: any sequence variation was deemed to be a contamination.In the view of many working on the issue and the patients, it seemed almostcalculated to avoid finding evidence of a retrovirus in the patient population.Yet, as Lipkin argued, using the old techniques in the old ways meant thechances for finding something new would be “increasingly infrequent.”* * *The disagreements between members of the Blood Working Group over which assaysto use did not appear to lessen the enthusiasm of other government entities totake the issue of XMRV and the blood supply quite seriously.On May 10 of 2010, shortly before Mikovits boarded a plane for Europe, theAmerican Association of Blood Banks released a bulletin that read: “The AABBInter-organizational task Force on Xenotropic Murine Leukemia Virus-RelatedVirus reviewed the risk of transfusion transmission of XMRV by individuals withCFS. The task force presented its recommendations to the AABB board ofdirectors, which approved an interim measure intended to prevent patients with acurrent or past diagnosis of CFS from donating blood or blood components.”10[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach14fn_454]Even ten months later the question of whether XMRV posed a risk to the bloodsupply was still not answered. A committee report from the Blood Working Grouppublished in the journal Transfusion asked: “Does XMRV pose a risk totransfusion recipients?Given that XMRV is a retrovirus and appears to be present in PBMCs (peripheralmononuclear blood cells) and in plasma, blood transmission, althoughundocumented, is possible. This possibility is supported by the demonstrationthat human cells have been infected in the laboratory by virus found in humanspecimens and by the transfusion transmissibility of other retroviruses (e.g.,HIV and HTLV). Related viruses are oncogenic and immunosuppressive in differentanimal species . . .11 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach14fn_455]The Blood Working Group considered new data as it appeared, specifically theconfirmatory study of Lo and Alter as well as research using rhesus macaquemonkeys.The study involving rhesus macaque monkeys was particularly valuable as itshowed that the virus quickly disappeared from the blood stream, presumablygoing into tissues. As with HIV/AIDS, immune stimulation caused the virus toreappear in the blood, where it could be detected by standard clinical methods.In addition, the parents of children with autism would probably have found asingle fact interesting about the rhesus macaque study of XMRV latency. What wasthe scientists’ immune stimulant of choice to provoke the virus and cause it toreplicate to detectable levels, and presumably cause disease?A vaccination.* * *When the Dutch magazine ORTHO broke the story that Drs. Alter and Lo hadconfirmed the findings of Mikovits and her team regarding XMRV, the patientcommunity buzzed with excitement over this development. Public healthauthorities reacted very differently.In an email to Frank Ruscetti on June 10, 2010, Lo explained the very curiouschain of events which had cause the Proceedings of the National Academy ofSciences (PNAS) to put a hold on their confirmatory study. Lo explained thatwhen their paper was submitted for review they were asked to retest and documenttheir PCR assay system for any trace amount of mouse DNA. They did and found nomouse DNA.The paper was accepted for publication, and the galley proof was ready, whenthey learned the CDC also had a paper in press, which did not find any evidenceof XMRV in ME/CFS patients. Although the Alter/Lo group had briefed the CDCthree months earlier, they had never mentioned that they had a negative study inpress.The CDC group as well as Lo/Alter were asked to put a hold on both papers, as itmight be confusing for the public that two government labs were reportingdifferent results. Lo did not think this was a good scientific precedent andconfessed at the end of the email that he was tired of this runaround but stillhoped that he and Ruscetti might work together on the problem.12[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach14fn_456]The email from Lo to Ruscetti was revealing, and bolstered Mikovits andRuscetti’s suspicions about the CDC’s investigation into XMRV.From the manner in which Reeves had told the New York Times that he did notexpect that his team would validate the findings, to the CDC’s narrowing of thesearch parameters for finding XMRV or a related murine leukemia virus (MLV), totheir insistence on using Silverman’s VP62 XMRV plasmid as the control standardwhile the Lo/Alter results confirmed Mikovits’s assertions about going beyondSilverman XMRV, it was becoming difficult to believe that the CDC was interestedin doing an objective scientific investigation of the XMRV question.The question, which still remains unanswered, is why research into XMRV seemedto cause public health authorities to make such an exceptional departure fromstandard scientific research protocol.* * *One would have expected that the editor-in-chief of the Proceedings of theNational Academy of Sciences, Randy Schekman, could easily explain thescientific reasoning behind the hold on the Lo/Alter confirmatory paper.But if anything, he only complicated the matter, raising far more questions thanhe answered. In an interview published by The Scientist entitled “Why I Delayedthe XMRV Paper,”13 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach14fn_457] Schekman tried to answerthe question of how a thoroughly vetted paper by a figure like Harvey Alter,(recipient of a Lasker Award for clinical research and the Distinguished ServiceMedal), could be held up in the galleys.Interviewer Cristina Luiggi explained, “According to Schekman, the paper hadgone through the proper review at their journal, and was ready to be publishedwhen he was ‘called by someone in the retrovirus field who expressed concerns.’This person remains unnamed, as does the ‘established person in the field’ with‘very high standards,’ not ‘involved in the controversy’ who would conduct‘independent review of the work.’”Who was this mysterious figure in the retroviral field who trumped thedesignated referees of the paper? This “someone in the retroviral field whoexpressed concern” must have been of great renown in the medical community.Mikovits wondered if it was Coffin, who since the July 22, 2009, meeting on XMRVat the NIH, three months before the publication of her research in Science,seemed to have set himself up as the arbiter of any research into XMRV?Did PNAS have such little faith in the quality of its peer reviewers that a callfrom an outside scientist could make them completely abandon their establishedprocedures? Luiggi asked how the process could have gone smoother:RS: . . . I feel we might have done a better job was in identifying how thisparticular paper might have caused [a controversy]. I was not aware of the paperuntil I got a call from this outside retrovirologist. If we’re going to befaulted at all at PNAS is that we weren’t aware of the implications of this workuntil after it was already accepted. And we try.The staff at Washington, they’re not trained scientists, but we try to examinethe papers that we’re reviewing to see if they have anything unusual about themthat would cause additional publicity . . .14[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach14fn_458]According to Schekman, the Lo/Alter paper was sent out for review to “twowell-known retrovirus experts” who had reported favorably on it. Then the PNASWashington staff of “not trained scientists” which would normally sniff outanything that would draw undue media attention or controversy also gave thegreen light.Despite the positive reviews of “two well-known retrovirus experts” and nowarnings from the Washington staff of “not trained scientists” it wasn’t untilSchekman got a call from this “outside retrovirologist” that he realized thejournal might reasonably be faulted for not being “aware of the implications ofthe work until after it was already accepted.The delay of the Lo/Alter confirmatory study did not appear to be based on anyscientific concerns that Schekman wanted to share. Who was this mystery “outsideretrovirologist” who was so well-known that he could make Schekman override theestablished procedures of the prestigious Proceedings of the National Academy ofSciences?And maybe more importantly, what did he say?* * *If sins exist in the world of scientific research, non-collaboration andunwillingness to share data or samples is without doubt thought a mortal sin,far more egregious than its venial cousin, refusal to share cookies in thecafeteria. Shared progress, the health of the world, and the improvement of thehuman condition depend on conscientious sharing of all relevant information.The scientist who doesn’t share his data isn’t just undercutting a rival, butsacrificing the health of others for personal gain.As Mikovits and Ruscetti became aware that William Switzer, (not an MD or PhD)and others at the CDC were planning to release a negative study about XMRV, thequestion came up as to whether the WPI had shared samples with the CDC. Mikovitssent out an email to the group to document her growing fears.I have just confirmed from my notebook codes and discussion with Frank Ruscettithat all 20 plasma samples sent to you (CDC) on 9/30/09 were confirmed positivein 3 independent laboratories including the subset of 12 sent to Ila (Singh).Not all assays were done at all laboratories on all samples, due to limitationsof quantity for some of the samples. XMRV was detected by DNA, PCR, CDNA PCR, WBusing monoclonocal antibodies for gag P30 and Env, transmissible virus to LNCaP,direct immune precipitation of virus and direct PCR detection of XMRV in theplasma . . .Patient samples from which XMRV was cloned and sequenced by Jaydip Das Gupta inLombardi et al. were all in the samples set sent.Judy and (Frank)15 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach14fn_459]What would strike Mikovits as so unusual, given the dissent in the Blood WorkingGroup over whether Switzer and his colleagues had been given positive XMRVsamples as found by the Mikovits group and others, as well as the conflictbetween the CDC study and that of Lo and Alter, was that the CDC would beallowed to go ahead unilaterally in the manner that it did.Even accepting the premise that two different agencies of the public healthestablishment should not come to differing conclusions on an important question,the standard expectation would be that both papers should be held until theywere reconciled.In fact, that is what people anticipated would happen, as detailed in an articleby Amy Dockser Marcus of the Wall Street Journal, who wrote about thecontroversy in an article published on June 30, 2010:It is unusual for a paper to be held after it has already gone through theformal peer-review process and been accepted for publication, say scientists whopublish frequently.“It’s fair to say it’s not a usual kind of thing,” said John M. Coffin, aspecial adviser to the National Cancer Institute and a professor at TuftsUniversity in Boston who wrote an editorial alongside the Science report inOctober. Dr. Coffin said he couldn’t comment specifically on the XMRV papers,but that scientists often come up with conflicting data, especially when a virusis new and not well understood as in the case with XMRV.16[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach14fn_460]It’s probably reasonable to say that a casual observer of the unfolding XMRVsaga would believe that the two papers would be compared, coordinated, andreleased at the same time so that some clarity might be brought to the issue.But that’s not what happened.Two days later, on July 1, 2010, the Switzer/CDC negative paper was published inthe journal Retrovirology. Lo and Alter’s paper would not be published untilAugust 16, 2010, six weeks later. If the intention behind holding the Lo/Alterpaper had been that the public health establishment didn’t want to confuse thepublic, wouldn’t it make more sense to coordinate the release of both papersrather than staggering the publications so that one of them was read by thepublic first?What message did it send to the public to release a negative study first, andthen wait six weeks to release a confirmatory study in August, the month wheneven doctors often take long vacations and when most people are distracted bysummer’s final events, moving into a dorm room, or getting the kids ready forschool?* * *The CDC’s XMRV study would come in for strong criticism based on the way theydiagnosed patients suffering from CFS. From the CDC’s own publication of July 1,2010:Briefly, between 2002 and 2003 we sampled adults 18 to 59 years old fromWichita, Kansas and between 2008 and 2009 we sampled adults 18 to 59 years oldfrom metropolitan, urban, and rural Georgia. In both studies, we used randomdigit-dial screening interviews to classify household residents as either wellor having symptoms of CFS. A follow-up detailed telephone interview wasadministered to all individuals with symptoms and to a probability sample ofthose without symptoms.17 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach14fn_461]“They just called people up on the phone and asked if they were tired!” was theway Frank Ruscetti later characterized it.18[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach14fn_462]If ME/CFS was the result of a viral infection, similar in many ways to otheroutbreaks, it made sense to go to those areas of the country that were reportedto have experienced such outbreaks, such as Incline Village, Nevada, orLyndonville, New York. Nobody could recall an outbreak or even a cluster ofME/CFS in Kansas or Georgia and yet the CDC had used samples from these twogroups (the “phone book” cohorts) exclusively in studies for decades,infuriating Mikovits as much as it had her team.The lack of any clinical diagnosis of ME/CFS, either through the exclusion ofother conditions, or findings of abnormal cytokines/chemokines, otherinflammatory markers, NK cells or RNase L data, also made the study groupsuspect.It was the computer programmer’s classic dilemma of “garbage in, garbage out.”If one chose a population of people unlikely to have the disease, it followedthat one would be unlikely to find any pathogens linked to the disease. Why wereso many intelligent scientists missing these very elementary concerns?As Mikovits and Ruscetti often said to each other when these issues came up,“They find what they want to find!”* * *Although the publication of the CDC paper in early July while the Lo/Alterresearch was still held from publication concerned Mikovits and her team, theyhad other issues to occupy their attention; namely, the grand opening of the $77million dollar facility at the Center for Molecular Medicine on the grounds ofthe University of Nevada at Reno.When fully up and running, the WPI would have a state-of-the-art patient medicalclinic, neuro-imaging through SPECT scans, and a clinical laboratory that wouldprovide testing for patients, support physician studies, and develop diagnosticmarkers of disease.There was a reception for donors, government officials, and personal friends ofthe Institute on Monday, August 16, 2010. The speakers included US Senator HarryReid, US Senator John Ensign (a Republican), members of the US Congress, ShelleyBerkley and Dean Heller, State Senator William Raggio, and University PresidentMilton Glick. Hillary Johnson and Amy Dockser Marcus of the Wall Street Journalwere also in attendance.During Annette Whittemore’s remarks she announced that the WPI’s basic researchlaboratory would be named the Judy Mikovits Laboratory.Fourteen months later, Mikovits would be thrown in jail and held there five dayswithout the opportunity for bail and without an arrest warrant, and to this dayhas not had a single day in court.The next day there was an invitation-only scientific symposium, which, asdescribed in a WPI press release, brought together “leading researchers,clinicians, and key collaborators from the medical and research community todiscuss the latest XMRV research findings, medical research data and evaluatetreatment outcomes since the publication of their 2009 XMRV study. The symposiumorganized by the WPI, entitled XMRV in Human Disease, was led by WPI Director ofResearch, Judy Mikovits.”From a press release of August 16, 2010:The completion of this building is the realization of a dream and a beacon ofhope for patients afflicted with neuroimmune diseases,” said Annette Whittemore,president and founder of the WPI. “Our strategic partnership with theUniversity, combined with this dynamic setting gives us confidence that theresearch done here will translate into innovative medical care for patientsaround the globe. We are proud that our work will soon lead to new avenues ofresearch and treatment for these diseases.19[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach14fn_463]On the following Saturday, August 21, the WPI had an open house for the publicthat included tours of the new facilities as well as researchers on hand todiscuss the new facility and its plan for further investigations.The entry to the building had a large, open atrium and large panes of glass,which let in the rays of the summer sun. Against the white stone planters whichdotted the space, many ME/CFS patients rested, often squinting in the harshlight. Some were in wheelchairs, some had oxygen tanks with the accompanyingnasal cannulas snaking into their noses.It was sobering to realize these were the “healthy” sufferers of the disease,those who could even travel to the WPI. In the large theater, which probablyseated close to three hundred people, there was a slide show of those who weremore severely affected than the ones who could get there.The silent slide show presented pictures of many patients before they had becomeill, often showing them engaged in athletic activities like running or hiking,then followed with pictures of them confined to their beds for most of the day,the shades drawn to keep out the sun because of their sensitivity toneurological stimuli like light.These were people for whom the idea of spending an afternoon at an “open house”was akin to getting on a rocket and traveling to the moon. But for those whosuffered from ME/CFS, the opening of the Whittemore Peterson Institute seemedlike one giant leap for all of them.* * *With the publication of the Alter/Lo study, there was the inevitable flurry ofinterest from the press, so on August 23, 2010, a question and answerteleconference was held with Alter and Lo. Alter began the teleconference byrecapping what had happened over the past several months.Alter began by talking about his coauthor, Shyh-Ching Lo, who had a number ofsamples from ME/CFS patients which had been gathered in 1990 by Anthony Komarofffrom Harvard University. The samples were “well-pedigreed” and had been stored“in pristine fashion in a frozen repository.” When the XMRV story broke. Lobecame interested in testing the samples.Alter and Lo found sequences which were closely related to what had beendesignated XMRV by Silverman, and noted that the Whittemore-Peterson group ledby Mikovits had discussed with them how they’d also found a more diverse groupof retroviruses than had originally been reported. Alter ended theteleconference by saying:So it’s really probably a better term is murine leukemia virus-related viruseswhich encompasses XMRV so we found this in a very high percentage of the chronicfatigue patients that Dr. Komaroff had sent to us—about 86 percent—andsimultaneously found that in about 6.6 percent of our healthy blood donors.So there was a dramatic association with chronic fatigue syndrome, with thesyndrome of chronic fatigue but that’s all it is . . . we think basically itconfirms the findings of the Whittemore Peterson group.20[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach14fn_464]Now with the findings of a combined team from the NIH and FDA, led by a worldfamous scientist, the results of the WPI had been confirmed. In most scientificinvestigations, that would have been the end of the story.Findings confirmed, proceed to the next stage.But the investigation into XMRV wasn’t playing out like any other story inscience."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIFTEENThe December 19 Hearing and DamagesIn our opinion, Dr. Mikovits has been “home-towned” from the outset of thecriminal and civil cases, by the Washoe County criminal justice system, as theresult of undue influence exerted by WPI’s owners. . . .But issuance of the warrants pales in comparison with the bail hold placed onDr. Mikovits, which prevented her from bailing out of jail in Ventura County forthe better part of a week and severely limited her ability to participate in herdefense to WPI’s motion for preliminary injunction. . . .Dennis Neil Jones, Dr. Mikovits’s lead attorney in the civil case, asked thecourt for permission to appear at the preliminary injunction by telephone,because he was recovering from knee replacement surgery and he was physicallyunable to attend the hearing. The Court refused his request, forcing Jones toarrange a last minute replacement unfamiliar with the case to attend thehearing.1 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach15fn_465]—From a planned, but unreleased, press releaseby Mikovits’s attorney, Dennis Neil JonesDecember 15, 2011Judy Mikovits was sitting in the lobby of the Lucerne Hotel in New York Citywhen she got a call from her attorney, Dennis Jones.2[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach15fn_466]She and Frank Ruscetti had traveled to New York to work with Ian Lipkin ofColumbia University, who had been given the task by NIH of determining why somegroups had been unable to find XMRV among the ME/CFS patient population whileothers like Lo and Alter had found it. Maureen Hanson of Cornell University andjournalist Hillary Johnson were also present for the meetings.Since her termination only three months earlier and arrest on November 18,Mikovits had flown largely under the radar, avoiding the press and publicity.After a few words, her attorney got to the point and told her she needed to comeback and appear at a hearing in Reno on December 19, four days away. Mikovitstold her attorney that he was out of his mind, that she was in New York City,and not going to any court controlled by the Whittemores. She then used somecolorful language common to many New Yorkers about what the Whittemores shoulddo to themselves.While the language she used may have passed without much notice to the majorityof the denizens of the Big Apple, the staff at the upscale Lucerne Hotelexpected such language to be left on the street.By their disapproving looks, they were telling her to keep her voice down.Jones tried to convince Mikovits that she would get an unbiased hearing beforeJudge Adams and that she needed to go. “This is ridiculous!” she shouted intothe phone. “You don’t understand! There is no way you’ll get a fair shake inthat courtroom!”Jones attempted to soothe her. “We decided you’re going to take the FifthAmendment, and I’m still comfortable with that. But you’ve got to produce yourpersonal emails, all 22,000 of them. We really don’t have any leeway on that.”In the preliminary issued while Mikovits was held on in a Ventura county jail,Judge Adams had given Mikovits two weeks to sort through all 22,000 emails anddecide which were personal and which were professional. Under normalcircumstances this would be a difficult task with an unfair time frame, butsince the police had taken all her electronics, leaving her without a computer,this was an especially impossible task.“Over my dead body,” said Mikovits. She told Jones that when she signed on asthe principal investigator that she was required to protect the identity of themore than 800 subjects who had signed consent forms in the various studies.Mikovits thought her attorney really didn’t comprehend the responsibilities of aprincipal investigator on a government grant. The participants had to know thatwhen they handed their blood or other samples over to the study, theirinformation would never find its way into the hands of an insurance company thatmight deny them coverage or physicians who might restrict or deny treatment.Her frustration was at a fever pitch.Jones again tried to convince her that she needed to go to Reno.“You can hold your kangaroo court, but I won’t be there! And you will not get myemails! Your attorney promised my personal email! I did not! I was in jail! Itold you no. That’s not how a principal investigator works!”Back in her hotel room, Hillary Johnson, Maureen Hanson, and Frank Ruscettibegged Judy to just hand over the emails, fearing that she would be jailedagain. But she was firm about not handing over documents containing studysubject names.* * *Her plane flew back to Santa Barbara in the early morning hours of December 18.Mikovits, David, and Dennis Jones went to Reno together later that day. This wasthe first time she actually laid eyes on Dennis Jones and the condition of theman was startling, even for someone accustomed to the worst ravages of cancer.Because of the knee replacement he’d undergone in November, he was using twocanes to walk with great difficulty. This manner of getting about made itdifficult for Jones to schlep his laptop around, so he simply brought his files.This was their champion, teetering about on his canes with his paper files.* * *In the car on the way to the airport, David drove and Dennis sat in the frontwith him while Judy sat in the back. Jones wanted to discuss a contract Mikovitshad allegedly signed on February 22, 2009, claiming that in the event she wasfired she would return all copies of all data to the WPI. Dr. Mikovits looked atthe paper and could not recall ever having seen it.She believed the signature page had been taken from another document. February22, 2009, was almost three years after she had begun working to develop theresearch program of the WPI. The idea that an academic researcher and professorwould sign such a clumsily-worded agreement that effectively turned her from aprofessional scientist with rights and responsibilities into anemployee-for-hire was ludicrous. There were other reasons to believe she hadnever signed it.On January 20 of 2009, she’d signed a joint agreement with the Cleveland Clinicand the NCI for their investigation of XMRV and ME/CFS. The informationdeveloped in that joint investigation belonged to all three institutions. Thisnew document claimed it superseded three years of collaborative researchagreements and that all intellectual property would be owned solely by the WPI.Dennis Jones was astute, but Mikovits worried he didn’t understand the biggerpicture. “This isn’t about grants and legalities of grant management. This isabout a set-up, a frame-up, and a cover-up! That’s what you need to see!”Mikovits knew the notebooks would provide the evidence that VIP Dx’s XMRV testwas worthless, and she believed the Whittemores knew it too. There was also thepossibility that the lab data contained in the notebooks would provide clues tohelp her understand ME/CFS, autism, and other diseases. Who knew what kind ofwindfall could come from curing those diseases?* * *As Judge Adams opened the hearing at 9:03 a.m., things started badly and onlygot worse. The Whittemores were represented by Ann Hall, whose husband workedfor the Washoe County District Attorney’s office, which had issued the searchwarrant for Mikovits’s house. To Mikovits, this was yet another corruptconnection between the civil and criminal cases.In addition to Dennis Jones, Mikovits was represented by criminal attorneysScott Freeman and Tammy Riggs, who had been retained that Monday afterThanksgiving when she was mysteriously required to appear in Reno for Science’smugshot.Mark Zaloras, who had appeared on Mikovits’s behalf on November 22, 2011, at theReno hearing while she sat in jail in southern California, was standing by ontelephone. The judge seemed angry that Zaloras was not physically present. Jonesexplained they’d been given only one day’s notice of the hearing.Jones then presented his first substantive argument, namely why Mikovits had notprovided her requested emails. Jones explained that Freeman had advised her thatshe could assert her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in thecriminal case. In addition, she didn’t have a criminal lawyer at the time andwas in jail in southern California at the time of the hearing on the preliminaryinjunction.When she was released, she hired Scott Freeman and he had recommended thatMikovits invoke her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incriminationregarding the emails, which she did. Mikovits believed the stronger argument wasthe one she’d made in New York to her colleagues, the argument that underfederal law she was required to protect the confidentiality of patients in thestudy, but she had chosen to trust the experience of Freeman.Jones proceeded to question why Mikovits was arrested on a no bail warrant, butJudge Adams returned to whether Mikovits had complied with the order to produceall of the emails. Jones replied that “counsel believed that the motion to staywould trump the entire civil case, including your prior order.”Adams asked whether Jones understood that the filing of the motion did not staythe court’s order to produce the emails. Jones said he did, which was why theyhad retained a company to copy the emails, but it was taking a significantamount of time. He went onto say that the volume of emails was tremendous, morethan 22,000 in all, and that to protect privacy he asked that a DiscoveryMaster—an independent court representative who would review the documents—beappointed to assist in not revealing patient information.The judge didn’t want to offer the services of a Discovery Master to sortthrough the emails. He simply wanted all 22,000 of them, regardless of thepatient information contained within.Jones protested that they needed one more week to finish copying them, but JudgeAdams would not waver, claiming it was inconsistent with the order entered onNovember 22, 2011. Jones responded by saying it was only inconsistent in date.Judge Adams replied, “Well, it’s inconsistent in terms of process. It’sinconsistent in every respect, isn’t it?” Mikovits sat next to her attorney,incredulous. She would only fully understand four months later on March 14,2012, when judge Adams recused himself admitting accepting more than $10,000from Harvey Whittemore.Jones said he wasn’t sure that the attorney who represented Mikovits in theprevious hearing, Mark Zaloras, understood a Discovery Master was available.There was also some concern by Zaloras as to whether the emails simply by beinghanded over, would become part of the public record.Judge Adams didn’t seem to believe these were reasonable concerns.Maybe sensing what Mikovits had warned him, Jones pushed the button for thelitigator’s most incendiary option. “I just have to say that I am verydisappointed and upset with the fact that my client has really been deniedeffective assistance of counsel by a series of events, including what we believeto be undue influence.”3 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach15fn_467]In both law and science, the claim of bias or undue influence is a grave charge.Judge Adams responded by asking who had denied her effective assistance ofcounsel.Joes replied, “Well, you would not allow me to appear by telephone even though Iwas on medical leave following surgery, so her lead counsel was not able toparticipate.”From that point, the judge seemed to change topics, all with the purpose of notrevisiting his earlier decision. “I’m totally unaware of that, but in any event,Mr. Zaloras is also counsel for the defendant. In fact, he’s one who has limitedbut lengthy experience in the criminal law, isn’t he?”Jones replied, “He is.”Judge Adams continued, “And finally, couldn’t he have advised the Court andopposing counsel that we couldn’t go forward with the Chambers conferencebecause of your unavailability? He never told me that. I certainly wouldn’t haveproceeded with the Chambers conference discussing broad orders concerningissuance of the preliminary injunction and the specific order on discovery if Ihad been advised that the defendant wasn’t represented by counsel. She wasrepresented by counsel and we had a very extensive Chambers conferenceconcerning the terms of the preliminary injunction order and the terms of theclerk’s discovery order.”4 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach15fn_468]Jones replied, “I understand that, your Honor. Understand that he did the besthe could under the circumstances, having never spoken with his client.”Judge Adams replied, “He didn’t tell me that he had never spoken with hisclient.”Jones tried to explain again. By the time of the November 22, 2011, preliminaryhearing in Reno, Dr. Mikovits had been in jail five days and Jones was the onlyattorney with whom she had discussed the case, one time, by phone, only fourdays before her jailing.Jones was well enough to appear by phone, but Judge Adams denied this request.After this denial, the best he could do was get another attorney, Mark Zaloras,to appear on her behalf.Zaloras couldn’t interview Mikovits because she was imprisoned without an arrestwarrant from November 18–22 in southern California. What is remarkable about thetranscript is that even Judge Adams admitted that Zaloras couldn’t commentknowledgably on the Fifth Amendment claim because he didn’t know anything aboutthe criminal case.5 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach15fn_469]Mark Zaloras could not interview her to get essential facts and backgroundbecause she was in jail in southern California.* * *Jones continued to press the bias issue.For those familiar with the severity of the charge of bias against a judge, aswell the subsequent revelation that Harvey Whittemore, family members, andbusiness entities had donated $10,400 to the campaign of Judge Adams, it readsas Kabuki Theater.Jones tried admirably to finesse the accusation of bias, falling just short ofoutright accusing the judge of corruption: “As I said, your Honor, I’m sure hedid the best he could, but he also told me at one point when he called me duringthe hearing that the handwriting was on the wall, your Honor was going to sign apreliminary injunction in his opinion, and the best he could do—” (emphasisadded).6 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach15fn_470]Jones’s implication must have been clear.“Just a moment. The hearing was set for the preliminary injunction. That was thetime at which the parties were entitled to produce witnesses, evidence andargument on the Motion for Preliminary Examination. Witnesses did appear, eventhough the defendant didn’t. At the request of counsel for both parties, I metwith counsel in Chambers, which resulted in the order and the preliminaryinjunction. If Mr. Zaloras felt that, quote, the handwriting was on the wall,end of quote, he was not only inaccurate, because I hadn’t heard any evidence onthe motion, didn’t prejudge it in any way” (emphasis added).“Secondly, he never told me that he wished to proceed with the hearing, that hewished he’d hear evidence from the plaintiff or present any evidence on thedefendant’s behalf, or that he felt in any way coerced or pressured ormaneuvered into making a decision on behalf of his counsel.”7[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach15fn_471]Judge Adams continued. “Again I stress, if he had not literally even talked tohis client before the hearing, which I find to be implausible, but if that werethe truth, I would expect that would be the number one thing he’d bring to theCourt’s attention. I would not expect that he would enter into by stipulationnot only a preliminary injunction, but a detailed order on the discoveryprocess. That just doesn’t make sense to me. Does it make any sense to you?”8[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach15fn_472]Judge Adams refused to accept that substitute counsel had been unable to discussthe particulars of the case with Mikovits while she was in jail in California.Did Judge Adams believe attorney Dennis Neil Jones, the former president of theVentura County Trial Lawyers Association, was flagrantly lying?If so, Adams should have thrown Jones in jail for contempt of court andviolating the canons of professional ethics.* * *To Dennis Jones, there were a number of issues that didn’t make sense.Why hadn’t he been allowed to appear by telephone?And while the initial claim against Mikovits contained no direct evidence, whileshe was in jail the Whittemore side had dropped the bombshell, a new affidavitsupposedly written by Mikovits’s research associate, Max Pfost, the day beforeher arrest, but not part of the November 7th lawsuit.How were they supposed to prepare to defend against this if they were givenmultiple documents and no time to decipher the truth? His client was in jail andJones was recovering from major surgery.* * *It seemed apparent that Judge Adams simply did not believe that Mikovits had nottalked with Mark Zaloras before the hearing.“Can you imagine any judge anywhere in the United States proceeding with such aconference, the lawyers entering these orders we’ve talked about, and havingbeen told that the lawyer on behalf of the defendant had never met with thedefendant, knew nothing about the case? You think there’s any judge in theUnited States who would do that except a judge subject to the due disciplineunder the code of judicial conduct and, in my view, subject to removal?”9[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach15fn_473]Even if Mark Zaloras hadn’t let the judge know he’d never spoken to his client,the judge still claimed that Zaloras didn’t know what Mikovits had been chargedwith or even where she was being held. That would have alerted the judge thatMikovits’s representation in the case was inadequate.At one point Adams said to Jones, “And I certainly don’t think you’re suggestingthat all that would have occurred had I been told that defense counsel had nowitnesses, had nothing to present, didn’t know how to counter the witnesses ofthe plaintiff, and had never even met the defendant?”10[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach15fn_474]That is exactly what Jones was saying, but for some reason Judge Adams wasn’taccepting it. In his summation of the case, Judge Adams claimed, remarkably,that Mikovits was perhaps the greatest villain to ever darken his courtroom,someone who had to be stopped at any cost.“The remedy for this conduct is within the discretion of the Court. In my entiretenure on this bench as presiding judge in Department 6, I have never rendered adefault against a disobedient party in a civil case pursuant to NRCP 37(b)2(c) .. .The defendant’s willfulness is demonstrated by every fact in this case. She didnot comply in any way, shape, or form with the Court’s Order, or the terms ofthe Preliminary injunction. She did not timely advise the Court or adverse partyof her unwillingness, her disability to perform it for her.”11[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach15fn_475]The Honorable Judge Brent Adams was appointed to his position on July 4, 1989,which meant when he served as the presiding judge in the case against Mikovitshe had been on the bench for twenty-two years. According to his own admission,in all that time he had never handed down a default judgment.A default judgment is the legal equivalent of a nuclear bomb.It means you have shown such disrespect for the court that you will not beallowed to present a defense. Even those who have just a passing familiaritywith the American legal system know that every person is supposed to get theirday in court.Everybody it seems, except for Judy Mikovits when she found herself in a Reno,Nevada, courtroom in front of a certain judge.A judge who three months later would be revealed to have received a verysubstantial campaign contribution from Harvey Whittemore. Judge Adam’s failureto remove himself from the case, or at least inform the parties and get a waiverfrom them, would probably have subjected him to an ethics investigation inforty-nine out of fifty states. The only state, which didn’t have such an ethicsrule, and left such issues purely to the judge’s discretion?Nevada.* * *The civil action against Mikovits had been filed on November 7, 2011.Mikovits had been unable to appear at the November 22, 2011 hearing becauseshe’d been in jail in southern California, having been arrested on November 18.Her attorney, Dennis Jones, had just undergone major surgery, and had to get areplacement attorney, Mark Zaloras, who was unfamiliar with the case. Zalorashad shared his impression with Jones that “the handwriting was on the wall” inthe case, and Jones even said so directly to Judge Adams.On December 19, 2011, she was found liable as a result of the default judgmenthanded down by Judge Adams.Dr. Mikovits had gone from having a case filed against her, to judgment beingtaken in less than six weeks, without being able to present a single piece ofevidence. How could anybody reasonably claim this was justice?* * *When the hearing was over, her criminal attorney, Scott Freeman, approached her.He spoke in a low but urgent voice. “If I were you, I’d get out of town just asfast as I could. Because I and everybody else sitting in this courtroom thoughtyou were going to be in jail. Get out of here before he changes his mind!”12[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach15fn_476]So, Mikovits, her husband, and Jones hurried back to their hotel, grabbed theirbags, and got to the airport three hours early. A part of Mikovits wished theyhad arrested her on the spot. She knew the patient community wouldn’t stand forsuch shenanigans and the effort might cause the whole thing to blow up in theWhittemore’s faces.But then there was David, who was twenty years her senior, and the entire ordealhad hurt him too much already. She didn’t know if he could handle her beingjailed again. They landed in Los Angeles happy to be free, but knowing that thedark forces were still operating against them.* * *As if the courtroom antics were not enough, and as if the mugshot was its ownpermanent tattoo, on December 23, 2011, Science completely retracted the October2009 article linking XMRV to CFS.Mikovits wondered why no one was asking about the possibility of commonscientific practices creating recombinant viruses plaguing the human race, andcausing a myriad of diseases, would never be answered.* * *On January 25, 2012, Judge Adams held a damages hearing. The hearing was quicklymoved to his chambers. Mikovits was not present but was represented by herattorneys, Dennis Jones and Scott Freeman. The Whittemores were present withtheir attorneys, niece Carli West Kinne and Ann Hall (whose husband worked forthe DA’s office).Since Judge Adams had entered a default judgment against Mikovits, all that wasleft was to determine the amount of damages Mikovits would pay the Whittemores.And the Whittemores had their number.They wanted Dr. Mikovits to pay them fifteen million dollars in damages.* * *"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXTEENThe 1st (and Last) International Workshop on XMRV and the World’s MostCelebrated Virus Hunter Enters the FrayWhen Ian Lipkin chose a career in infectious diseases, he envisioned hunting forpathogens in daring treks around the world. Though disappointed to learn thatmodern-day virus hunters work largely from the lab, he still wound up as apioneer. . . . Lipkin has developed groundbreaking techniques that have helped anew generation of disease detectives sleuth out the infectious roots of mysteryills, chronic disease and neuro-psychiatric disorders like autism and OCD.—Discover, May 11, 20121 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach16fn_477]Dr. Mikovits did not have a clear idea when the planning first began for whatwas later dubbed the 1st International Workshop on XMRV, scheduled for September7 and 8, 2010. She was sure that organizing took at least six months and firstinvitation letters were emailed April 21, 2010.2[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach16fn_478]The decision to have it must have been made sometime in the winter of 2009–2010,probably when the controversy about XMRV in humans was really crystalizing. Theconfirmation study by Lo and Alter was probably not yet known to the organizers,and thus it was initially set up to focus overwhelmingly on the negative studiesthat had generated the post-Science controversy.The conference was organized by familiar players through a group in theNetherlands: John Coffin, Stuart Le Grice, Robert Silverman, Jonathan Stoye, aCoffin protégé from the UK, and Charles Boucher from Holland Frank Ruscetti wasoriginally invited to speak, but he protested to Silverman and Le Grice thatneither Mikovits or Singh were invited to present, which seemed an unsightlyomission since they had done the most important work since Silverman.Ruscetti, ever the cynic, saw their lack of inclusion as evidence of the OldBoys Club, anti-feminist power infrastructure in science. Annette Whittemore wasalso upset when she saw the proposed line-up of speakers and wanted toimmediately mobilize the patient groups to start a blitzkrieg of protests.Mikovits vetoed that idea and proposed a different course of action. Shecontacted anybody she had worked with in the field whom she knew had positivedata similar to her own, and asked them to submit an abstract.She had a whole list of giant minds in this category. There was Dr. David Bell,the gentleman doctor who had visited some of his rural patients on horseback andhad been treating ME/CFS patients for more than twenty years since encounteringa pediatric outbreak in upstate New York. Paul Cheney, the groundbreaker of theIncline Village outbreak, Dr. Julio Blanco and his team from Barcelona, Spain,Dr. Jose Montoya of Stanford University who had great compassion and a fiercelyinvestigative attitude toward ME/CFS. Dr. Michael Snyderman, an oncologist whohad tested positive for the antibody to XMRV and chronic lymphocytic leukemia(CLL), and had been treating himself with antiretroviral medications, which—ashe documented—had put his cancer into remission.Mikovits recalled the response of those she contacted being very gracious andsupportive. Eventually eleven or twelve abstracts from researchers with positivereports about XMRV were submitted for presentation at the conference. While anabstract lacks the influence of a peer-reviewed paper published in a topjournal, it is usually a good indicator of where the field is going and thus anintegral part of future funding strategies concerning a given scientific topic.The organizers of the conference had little choice but to respond to this influxof abstracts, although their decisions didn’t always seem to make sense.The only positive abstract submitted that was given a speaking spot was the onesubmitted by Mikovits entitled “Detection of Infectious XMRV in the PeripheralBlood of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Patients in the United Kingdom.” Mikovits wasalso invited to chair the fourth roundtable discussion on ME/CFS with JohnCoffin, as well as participate as a panel member in a question and answersession that would be web-cast around the world. But it was the researchMikovits presented on ME/CFS patients in the United Kingdom that would provokethe greatest firestorm. It even attracted the attention of Dr. Francis Collins,the head of the National Institutes of Health.After that, a very different “Battle of Britain” began.* * *In 2002, Dr. Jonathan Kerr was the Sir Joseph Hotung Clinical Senior Lecturer inInflammation, as well as the Honorable Consultant in Microbiology at SaintGeorge’s University in London, but in 2010 he suddenly left research for privatepractice. His career downgrade raised the question whether Kerr was like otherhistorical researchers who stumbled upon inconvenient truths and found theircareers suddenly jeopardized.In 2008 Kerr authored what was billed as a “Major Article” in the Journal ofInfectious Disease, “Gene Expression Subtypes in Patients with CFS/ME.” Asexplained in the article:The goal of this study was to determine the precise abnormalities of geneexpression in the blood of patients with CFS/ME . . .Using this approach, we identified differential expression of 88 human genes inpatients with CFS/ME. Among these genes, highly represented functions werehematological disease and function, immunological disease and function, cancer,cell death, immune response, and virus infection.3[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach16fn_479]To fully appreciate the importance of this information it’s probably necessaryto make a brief detour into the field of epigenetics, which had been turning astandard Darwinian understanding of evolution and genetics on its head.In the typical Darwinian understanding of evolution and genetics, an animaleither has a trait (or the recessive trait for the gene), or it doesn’t. Whathappens to an organism during its lifetime has no effect on the geneticinheritance it passes down to its young. In other words, these traits stayfixed. The classic demonstration of this principal is that rats who have theirtails cut off give birth to offspring with tails.What’s being discovered in epigenetics (which means “on top of genes”) is thatdiet, daily stresses, even toxins can turn gene functions on or off likeswitches, making us more susceptible to disease or infection.Because of her expertise in epigenetics, Mikovits was immediately intrigued byKerr’s interesting work. Kerr’s group found that among the well-defined CFS/MEpopulation, there was abnormal activity in eighty-eight of their genes. It wasif their internal switchboard had gone mad.Genes of people with CFS/ME were behaving in a radically different way thanthose of healthy individuals. The data had significance not only for ME/CFS, butalso for Gulf War illness (GWI), a related controversial disease.One gene in Kerr’s studies, NTE, is the primary site of action oforganophosphate (OP) compounds, such as sarin nerve gas (one of the agents someGWI veterans were exposed to during deployment, and organophosphates are alsoused regularly in civilian life as pesticides), which causes axonal degenerationand paralysis due to inactivation of its serine esterase activity. In thenervous system of adult chickens, OP-modified NTE initiates neurodegeneration.NTE probably regulates neuron-glial interactions during development and possiblyalso during adult life. Exposure to OPs may thus trigger CFS/ME and Gulf WarIllness.4 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach16fn_480] Kerr had crossed a red line bysuggesting that some type of chemical exposure, like organophosphates in sarinand in widespread civilian use, might be affecting gene expression, particularlythose genes involved in brain function and proper regulation of the immunesystem.In such an environment of abnormal gene expression as the result of a chemicalexposure, was it beyond imagination that a previously suppressed retrovirusmight cause havoc? A chemical exposure, followed by changes in gene expression,could lead to the increased ability of a previously suppressed retrovirus to doharm.Since the immune system was faulty due to changes in gene expression, it wouldbe hard to say whether it was the immune system, the chemicals, or theretrovirus doing the greatest amount of damage. The picture looked like a “wrongplace, wrong time” breakdown caused by multiple and possibly synergisticfactors.* * *Because of his research and reputation for being precise yet low-key, Kerr was anatural fit for Mikovits. They wrote an application as multiple principalinvestigators for a federal grant (known as an RO1 grant) to study pathogens andpatterns of gene expression in ME/CFS patients.Submitting their first proposal in June of 2007, they were awarded the grant inSeptember of 2009 after two revisions. It was the first federal grant the WPIreceived. However, if one of the Principal Investigators in such a study loseshis or her academic association, the grant may be recalled, unless anotherresearcher from the same institution can step in or it can be shown that theremaining Investigator can fulfill the research objectives. Mikovits wassurprised when Kerr was not given tenure at St. George’s University. After that,his name suddenly appeared on a negative XMRV study.A ME/CFS parent named Chris Cairns, who wrote a blog with the handle the “CFSPatient Advocate” (his daughter has CFS), chronicled the veering course of Kerrover the years in a June 9, 2010, post. While he was not in a position to knowexactly what happened to Kerr, Cairns normally attended many of the scientificmeetings on ME/CFS and was a jovial colleague to many of the researchers. Hisarticle was a window into the puzzling change in Kerr. It also reflectedconcerns of the patient community that something unusual, and potentiallysinister, was happening in the research.Cairns was formerly professor of fine arts at Haverford college and was honoredby the WPI on September 14, 2011, as “Advocate of the Year,” two weeks beforeMikovits was fired. Kerr begins by noting that the expectation had built through2009 that “something big” was going to come out of the WPI, and then in Octoberof 2009, the XMRV research was published. Cairns noted that Kerr seemed todisappear after that, then his name was “tacked onto a strangely negativevalidation study of XMRV.” Then came the Invest in ME conference in May of 2010,and the strangeness continued.Jonathan Kerr was invited to update his research at the Invest in ME conferencein May 2010. He was not in attendance as the conference began and came inhalfway through the morning. He gave a very short lecture where he turned awayfrom the microphone towards the slides on the screen and talked in his usualinaudible voice. No one could hear anything he was saying.5[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach16fn_481]Despite his apparently reputation as a soft-spoken mumbler, Kerr waswell-respected in both the scientific and patient communities prior to 2010,viewed by the patient community as one of the researchers who honestly searchedfor answers to their condition. That sharply changed in 2010, as Cairnscontinued to describe what seemed like erratic behavior by Kerr at the 2010Invest in ME conference in London.A woman asked a question and Kerr turned away from the microphone as he spoke.His slides were bleached out. At the end of his talks he usually talkedeffusively about his research help. This time he showed a slide with a pictureof a group greatly diminished in number, then mentioned his research was fundedby the ME Trust, a group that was suspected by many in the community as pushinga psychiatric explanation for their disease. Cairns continued:To this observer it was obvious that Dr. Kerr was embarrassed and did not wantto be at this conference. His entire manner and presentation, or lack ofpresentation, spoke of him just wanting to disappear. He was noticeably notinteracting as in the past. He seemed like dead weight, and psychologically halfhis size.6 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach16fn_482]For Cairns, who had seen Kerr present a number of times, this was trulyunconventional behavior. The picture Cairns painted was of a scientist undersome kind of psychological siege. Cairns asked how it had all come to this andsuggested his own explanation.It had been obvious from the beginning that Dr. Kerr’s CFS/ME gene work did notwin approval from his colleagues in the UK . . . The writing was on the wall andthings obviously got hotter for him when he collaborated with this rogue agencyin the US, this WPI place.And then XMRV hit the fan and that was enough for Dr. Kerr’s colleagues. Theypulled the plug on him. In various countries they put polonium 210 in the soup,in the UK they just give the “poison pill” (in a collegial manner.) I imaginethat Kerr always expected that something bad was going to happen. So he must nothave been surprised when the late night call came, or someone cornered him inthe hallway of his tiny research facility—urging him to disassociate himselffrom “those people.”This friendly fellow or gal, a fully supportive, honest soul, must have said tohim, “Jon, pull yourself together, just take this pill, just take this poisonpill. Swallow it with a full glass of water”.7[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach16fn_483]While Cairns’s suspicions about what had happened to Kerr (that is, hisallegation that someone offered a metaphorical “poison pill”) could not beconfirmed, the events complicated the federal grant he had been awarded jointlywith Mikovits.Mikovits knew she was on a short timeline to save the grant, and wouldn’t let itgo without a fight.* * *Prior to Kerr’s failure to get tenure, they had collected most of the controlsthey needed but hadn’t made the arrangements to get the patient samples. Theyneeded those samples desperately if they were going to have any chance ofretaining their grant and finishing the research.Mikovits called Phlebotomy Services International, a company that hired peopleto draw blood around the world and knew about grants and institutions, medicalprotocols, security, and performing work under the Institutional Review Boardrules that covered medical research. Mikovits explained to the founders of thecompany, what she needed and begged for their help.The couple knew the importance of the project and offered to volunteer theirtime, but needed somebody to pay their plane fare to England and for a hotel andsupplies they’d need for the job. Mikovits put five or six thousand dollars onher own American Express card to get them to England, and a generous anonymousdonor came up with the five thousand they needed for supplies.Mikovits contacted some of the patient groups in the London area to determine ifthey could assist in shuttling patients to draw locations. Many patients wouldneed a ride, and preferably from somebody who understood how taxing such aventure would be to a person with ME/CFS. The patient groups waged a heroicresponse and were able to get nearly fifty ME/CFS patients in the very short fewdays that the phlebotomists were available. A handful of patients were too weakto travel, so one of the phlebotomists made a pilgrimage to their homes to gettheir samples. Other patients would likely have physical payback so they wereheroic in their efforts as well.After a panicked night when the samples were held up by FedEx, by the next dayall of the samples had made it to Frank Ruscetti’s lab at the National CancerInstitute and were waiting to be processed. Since questions had been raised thatXMRV was simply mouse contamination, Mikovits wanted the samples to go directlyto Frank’s lab so he could arrange to have them processed in a facility thatnever handled mouse samples. This should have ended the contamination dispute.Mikovits believed they had taken all necessary steps to save the RO1 grant andthat she could make a credible argument that Kerr’s part in the study could betransferred to the WPI.* * *Gerwyn Morris was a member of the UK group of patients and it was through anemail to Mikovits about the possibility of getting into the study that he struckup a friendship with her.8 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach16fn_484] A chemist andmicrobiologist by training, he joined a couple of ME/CFS forums right before theScience paper came out. He had very little difficulty unraveling the design ofstudies, and so he shared his expertise with the non-scientists on the forums.Morris had gotten sick with ME/CFS around 1971–1972, when he was a pubescentfourteen years old, well over a decade before the first “modern” US outbreak in1984–1985.Over the years he went through an oscillating pattern of recovery and illness, apattern Cheney has noted is more common in pediatric cases, who often haverecovery periods, sometimes consuming several years of his life. Morris was avocal critic of the four negative studies right after the Science paper, and in2013 detailed his objections for this book.His concerns revolved around the difficulty of the PCR systems used in most ofthe negative studies, as PCR is a process known to be extremely sensitive toeven slight variations in conditions. In an interview for this book, Morrisdiscussed his concerns.“If anybody believes or reads anything about MuLV viruses, they will know thatthey don’t come alone. A retrovirus never comes in one homologous sequence. Itjust doesn’t. Not even if they replicate by something called clonal expansion,which most retroviruses do, [with] HIV being the exception, not the norm.”9[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach16fn_485]“So if you actually are going to target one particular sequence in your PCRassay, because the way they designed their assays was to calibrate or optimizethem, so that they could actually detect a low copy number of viral plasmids,VP-62, and in sparkling brand new human DNA, that is for a start, never, evergoing to be anything like getting a virus out of biological sample and thevarious corruptions of DNA that can occur.”10[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach16fn_486]Morris also thought the scientists were setting their sights on a too-smallbull’s-eye, the VP-62 clone of Silverman, rather than the broader sequencesfound by Mikovits and Lo and Alter. “You can’t say for a fact that this PCRassay which they replicated ad nauseum in all of the studies, could even detecta very slight variation on the VP-62 clone. So it’s fairly obvious that theyweren’t actually genuinely trying to find a retrovirus in my view. I think theyhad [already] decided for one reason or another that VP-62 was a contaminant,and they would only bother to look for examples of the contaminant.”11[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach16fn_487]“But by using the PCR testing they did, they were capable of detecting onlyVP-62. And if one is totally honest about it, the way that retrovirusesintegrate into the CpG islands, they’re very high, density of guanine andcytosine, cross-linked, which means they’re very difficult to pull apart andre-anneal. And you have to have very special cycling conditions to be able topick up anything in those regions. So, even if they were looking for VP-62, thevirus, in my view, and in my background in biochemistry, they would not be ableto detect it. But the basic question is, whether you can be certain from thescientific level of certainty whether the virus you’re looking for is in thatsample, and that question was never answered.”12[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach16fn_488]To put it in simpler terms scientists have shown that false negatives as well asfalse positives can occur in PCR assays.He was also clear about what he considered Mikovits’s strengths and weaknesses“She is one of the most honest, caring individuals I’ve ever had the pleasure ofmeeting. Her weakness, I think, is naïveté. I don’t think she can contemplatethat other scientists are not quite as honest as her. And I don’t think she cancontemplate how rich and powerful interests can manipulate the population as awhole. And I don’t think she can buy into the fact that she’s been manipulatedas well.”13 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach16fn_489]Morris also voiced strong opinions about whether animal retroviruses werecirculating in the human population. “I think that there are gamma-retrovirusesout there. Vaccines were passed through animal tissue, like smallpox waspassaged through mouse brains, before they knew anything about what they weredoing. They were creating replication recombinant retroviruses with gay abandonin the early vector research until they realized what they were doing.”14[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach16fn_490]“If there aren’t some gamma-retroviruses circulating in the human populationthere bloody well ought to be. What I think the Science results were: I thinkJudy might have been picking up a HERV-W, which is a gammaretroviral HERV [humanendogenous retrovirus], otherwise known as the multiple sclerosis retrovirusbecause it was talked about as a cause of MS for the better part of fifteenyears. It’s been around, [but] whether it’s a primary cause or its activation isa secondary cause of pathology . . . I don’t think anybody knows. I suspect thatoxidatively modified envelope protein [a reaction in the cell to foreignproteins] could have triggered Judy’s antibody test.”15[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach16fn_491]Gerwyn couldn’t give a definitive identification of the current virus plaguingpatients, but it was clear something of a viral nature was going on.“Judy’s results cannot be explained by contamination. The ‘contamination’occurring in her lab was just Fantasy Island. A lot of people would like to makethe facts fit their theory, but they don’t. The multiple lines of evidence inJudy and Frank’s study [demonstrates] there’s no way that’s contamination.”16[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach16fn_492]* * *But Mikovits’s lobbying to get positive data into the 1st International Workshopon XMRV still paid off. More than ten abstracts confirmed basic parts of theretroviral theory advanced by Mikovits.Maureen Hanson of Cornell University submitted one entitled “XMRV in ChronicFatigue Syndrome: A Pilot Study” in which she took 30 adult subjects, 10 withsevere CFS, 10 who had “recovered” from the disorder, and 10 controls and testedtheir blood. Markedly, even a significant number of ME/CFS patients identifiedas “recovered” showed evidence of XMRV. Hanson stated clearly in her abstract,“Our results corroborate those of Lombardi et al.”Dr. B. P. Danielson from Baylor College of Medicine contributed “XMRV Infectionof Prostate Cancer Patients from the Southern United States and Analysis ofPossible Correlates of Infection.” The abstract agreed with findings that XMRVdid not seem to be correlated with the genetic defect in the RNase L pathwaysuggested by Robert Silverman of the Cleveland Clinic. Tissue testing—whichmight find latent virus not as easily cleared from blood—seemed a keydeterminant in testing to the team from Baylor.From Emory University came more detailed evidence of the sequences of XMRVintegrated into prostate cancer tissue, in “Variant XMRVs in Clinical ProstateCancer.” This abstract concluded that, “Clinical prostate cancer samples containintegrated XMRV pro-viral sequences, which can be amplified in nested PCRapproaches with approximately 1000 more bases than can be attributed to XMRValone.17 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach16fn_493]Silverman and Das Gupta of the Cleveland Clinic weighed in with the positivefinding of the “Presence of XMRV RNA in Urine of Prostate Cancer Patients”. RNAis the messenger molecule of DNA and can be used to detect active infection. Ifa test were developed utilizing urine instead of blood or tissue, detection inmen at risk of prostate cancer would be hugely simplified.Another abstract by Silverman explored XMRV and gene function, “XMRV InfectionInduces Host Genes that Regulate Inflammation and Cellular Physiology,” andfound that:“The chemokine IL8 is one of the most highly induced genes in response to XMRVinfection of prostate cancer cell line DU 145. XMRV induction of the 30 hostgenes identified in this study suggests a profound effect of the virus onfundamental cellular physiology and inflammation.18[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach16fn_494]The Mikovits lab had also found that the chemokine IL8 was the inflammatorymarker most strongly correlated with XMRV infection, so they had located thesame signature. The data that XMRV affected genes were implicated in cancer wasnot surprising but sobering.The researchers seemed to be slowly mapping the mechanism by which XMRV led toprostate cancer.* * *Paul Cheney must have had the gratifying feeling of coming to the end of a longjourney when he submitted his abstract. Many credited him for originallysuggesting that a retrovirus underlies ME/CFS, although he modestly claimed thatthe media firestorm around AIDS would have put the seed in someone’s mindeventually.Cheney’s abstract, “XMRV Detection in a National Practice Specializing inChronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS),” began with a historical recap, then hisconclusions corroborated Mikovits’s work and he asked the question of whetherfamily members of ME/CFS patients were also at risk. He concluded:“XMRV was detected in 74.5% of 47 consecutive cases of well-characterized CFSfrom 24 states and two countries. There is a high positivity rate (50%) of XMRVin non-CFS exposure controls within family members.19[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach16fn_495] Patients reported significant illness infirst order family members.”20 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach16fn_496]Troubling results also came from a collaboration between Emory University, theCleveland Clinic, and Abbot Laboratories in the abstract “XMRV Induces a ChronicReplicative Infection in Rhesus Macaques Tissue But Not in Blood.”This research found the virus seemed to disappear relatively quickly from theblood, but remained in tissue where it could replicate to detectable levels uponimmune stimulation.21 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach16fn_497] The immune stimulantthey used was an injection of bolus peptides that mimicked a vaccination.The virus in other words raised an under-the-radar immune response, rapidly leftthe blood, and settled into tissues. It could be a stealth invader.Nobody knew whether these individuals with no knowledge of their XMRV infectionwere walking time-bombs, waiting for an immune crisis that allowed theretrovirus to emerge from hiding to cause significant damage.Harvey Alter and Shyh-Ching Lo of the FDA presented an abstract of their paperpreviously published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences thathad confirmed Mikovits’s work and caused such consternation the previous summerthat its publication was delayed for several months. They reported:“We found MLV-like virus gag gene sequences in 32 of 37 patients (86.5%)compared with only 3 of 44 (6.8%) healthy volunteer blood donors . . . Noevidence of contamination with mouse DNA was detected in the PCR assay system orany of the clinical samples. Seven of 8 gag-positive patients were againpositive in a sample obtained nearly 15 years later.”22[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach16fn_498]Mikovits and her team found that 67 percent of her well-characterized ME/CFSpopulation showed evidence of XMRV infection. Alter and Lo found evidence that86.5 percent of their well-characterized ME/CFS population showed evidence ofinfection by a broader group of murine leukemia viruses.Mikovits and her team found that 3.7 percent of a healthy control populationshowed evidence of XMRV infection. Alter and Lo’s research showed that 6.8percent of a healthy control population showed evidence of infection by thiswider group of murine leukemia viruses.Statistically broken down, this meant that between eleven and twenty-one millionindividuals in the United States were potentially infected by this group ofrelated murine leukemia viruses.The emerging picture was of a simmering plague that could take years or decadesto show its explosive potential.* * *Along with Mikovits’s work, the most controversial was an abstract coauthored byFrank Ruscetti and Mikovits’s research associates, Max Pfost and Katy Hagen,“Detection of Infectious XMRV in the Peripheral Blood of Children.” The studycontained 66 subjects: 37 parents and 29 children. 17 of the children werediagnosed with autism, a pair of three-year-old twins had Niemann-Pick Type C, aneurodegenerative disorder, and 10 healthy siblings.They wrote:“an understanding of XMRV infection rate in children may be particularlyhelpful, given that 1 in 100 children in the US are diagnosed with neuroimmunedisorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and that CFS and childhoodneuroimmune disorders share common clinical features including immunedysregulation, increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines andchemokines, and chronic active microbial infections.XMRV was detected in 55% of 66 cases of familial groups from 11 states.Sequencing of PCR products of env and gag confirmed XMRV. The age range of theinfected children was 2–18. 17 of the children (including the identical twins)were positive for XMRV (58%) and 20 of the 37 parents (54%) were positive forXMRV. 14 of 17 autistic children were positive for XMRV (82%).”23[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach16fn_499]This was earth-shattering news for autism parents, because along with themacaque study it also supported the theory that these children might have beenharboring an undetected retrovirus in their immune cells that could be activatedthrough an immunization.The immune challenge of a vaccination could have offset the body’s delicatesuppression of the retrovirus, bringing it out of hiding. For other children, asimple fever could have begun the immune cascade that led to autism.Mikovits knew that among the autism communities there were many who traced theonset of their child’s problems to a vaccination, while others felt their childhad exhibited signs from birth. An immune challenge to the mother duringpregnancy could have also stimulated the retrovirus to rampage. Mikovits knewthis was controversial territory.But her job was not to shy away from or even indulge controversy, but rather toseek scientific truth.* * *In a harrowing twist, Mikovits almost didn’t get to present at the 1stInternational Workshop on XMRV because her laptop broke down. This would havebeen a tragedy since Francis Collins—head of the NIH, and former head of theHuman Genome Project, which was also centered in Cold Spring Harbor (andpossibly the most ambitious government science project since the Manhattanproject that built the first atomic bomb)—planned to sit in on her talk.She was staying at the home of her twin sister and planning to celebrate thebirthday of her beloved niece who was born the day she turned in her PhD thesis,September 6, 1991. But relaxing family plans over Labor Day weekend took abackseat to the panic that set in when her laptop crashed and had swallowed herpresentation. She emailed Pfost back at the lab saying that she needed him toreassemble it. When she later read his emails, it was clear he had burntmidnight oil and coffee until at least 4:00 a.m. reassembling it. She had nevermet a more dedicated research associate or student than Pfost. What he sent toher was perfect.The meeting took place at the NIH main building in Bethesda, Maryland, in theMasur Auditorium. Mikovits was slated to be the last speaker before lunch on thesecond day, followed by a short question and answer session.That session opened with an invited lecture on ME/CFS by Frank Ruscetti, a talkby Brigitte Huber of Tufts University regarding her inability to detect XMRV inpatient samples, Maureen Hanson of Cornell University on her success indetecting XMRV in ME/CFS patients, Lo of the FDA on his positive study withHarvey Alter of the NIH, and finally, Mikovits on the UK patients.Francis Collins attended the opening, listened for a little while, then left. Onthe second day, shortly before Mikovits spoke, he reappeared, trailed by hisstaff, and sat quietly. Most people knew Collins for his work as director of theHuman Genome Project, but others saw a less conventional side, at least for ascientist. He’d detoured from expectations by writing a book called, TheLanguage of God, in which he detailed his belief in a supreme being and a uniquedestiny for every living person, and a companion book The Language of Genes,which tried to unify science and religion by postulating that an almightycreator did not conflict with his abilities as an objective scientist.With perhaps the most powerful man in the US public health system sitting infront of her, Mikovits took the stage and began her talk about the patients fromthe United Kingdom.Her presentation followed point by point of her submitted abstract. She detailedhow they’d found XMRV in a subset of ME/CFS patients in England and they neededto develop more information about replication and pathogenesis. There was also agreat need to develop tools for screening and treatments.24[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach16fn_500]Despite the panic of the previous day, Mikovits felt serene and confident in themiddle of her talk. She had run through the important parts of her research in asteady, methodical manner. She described how her team had carefully andstrategically weeded out any potential obstacles. They’d been concerned aboutthe possibility of contamination so after the samples were drawn they wereshipped directly to the NCI and processed in lab that did no mouse or retroviruswork.Since their team believed patient selection criteria was likely to be the mostimportant variable in detecting XMRV or a closely related retrovirus they’d usedthe world’s most rigorous definition for the disorder. She ran through the fivedifferent methods they’d used to detect evidence for the virus and noted that itappeared that for best results they needed to utilize some form of molecular orbiological amplification.They’d developed a new set of primers to detect the envelope of the virus and infollowing along with Alter and Lo’s work, they were finding a wider variety ofgenetic diversity in the virus, including xenotropic and polytropic sequences.This meant that certain strains of the virus were clearly able to infectdifferent species.All in all, the study seemed to be an elegant counter-point to the negativestudy by Jonathan Stoye and her former collaborator, Jonathan Kerr. One of thepieces of data she added to her presentation that had not been in the abstractwas that approximately 5 percent of the controls were positive for XMRV, anumber which was comfortably between their original research and Alter and Lo’sconfirmatory study.Collins raised a question after her talk. He wanted to know where she’d gottenthe control samples. She told him the samples had come from the London BloodBank and were procured by her collaborator, the suddenly elusive Kerr. Collinsthanked her and left the workshop a few moments later. Based on his laterbehavior, he must have been impressed by what he’d heard.The question and answer session, chaired by Coffin and Mikovits, with JonathanStoye, a protégé of Coffin, serving as a kind of master of ceremonies.Eventually, Mikovits was queried on her opinion about using antiretrovirals. Acommentary co-authored by Andy Mason that appeared along with the Alter/Loconfirmatory study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences hadsuggested that it was time to seriously consider a trial usage of existing andapproved antiretroviral medications for CFS patients, so it seemed timely.25[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach16fn_501]Mikovits simply quoted the last line of Mason’s commentary in part: “At thisjuncture, studies to establish proof of principle are justified to determinewhether safe antiviral regimens can impact ME/CFS.” If an opinion expressed inthe Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences wasn’t good enough, thenwhat was?* * *A day or two after the meeting, Mikovits received word that Collins had mandateda multi-center study to be directed by Ian Lipkin of Columbia University.Unlike the planning for the 1st International Workshop on XMRV, the WPI andMikovits were chosen for the multi-center study. Despite the difficulties,Mikovits and her collaborators had experienced the last few years, it finallylooked like the ME/CFS community (and possibly other impacted groups) werefinally going to get the scientific investigation they deserved after decades oflimbo.The best news was that she learned the RO1 grant, which she’d been in danger oflosing since Kerr had lost his academic affiliation, now it would be awarded toMikovits of the WPI. Mikovits and Ruscetti were encouraged by the positive datafrom Hanson, Lo/Alter, and all of the prostate research groups that, inoften-sexist science, never seemed to generate heated attacks.It was difficult to believe that these divergent groups coming to the sameconclusions were all victims of exotic biology and contamination falling fromthe sky like some kind of blood rain.* * *From the beginning of his academic career, Ian Lipkin was unconventional. He wasin the first class of men at Sarah Lawrence College where he studiedanthropology and shamanism. Rather than pursue cultural anthropology, he wantedto become a medical anthropologist and bring back traditional medicines to theWest.After medical school, he took a residency at the University of California, SanFrancisco (UCSF) just before the AIDS epidemic began. When AIDS (known then asGRID, or Gay-Related Immune Disease) blitzkrieged the Bay Area, he was one ofthe few physicians willing to see patients who were infected and had one of theneurological disorders associated with the disease. The medical community wouldeventually realize that HIV was turning the body against itself, a hallmark ofan autoimmune disease.One of the early treatments for HIV was a process called plasmapheresis, inwhich blood is removed from a patient and put into a centrifuge, with whitecells and platelets in one area, red blood cells in another, and plasma in yetanother. The plasma was known to contain antibodies, that in HIV/AIDS causedpart of the problem. The plasma was replaced with albumin so that the bloodvolume was maintained, then the blood was returned to the individual. Manypatients experienced significant relief from this treatment, though they weren’tcured.Lipkin thought one of his patients, a ski instructor from Vail, Colorado withHIV/AIDS, might benefit from it, but many physicians weren’t interested inplasmapheresis. In a May 2012 article from Discover, Lipkin recalled those days,showing the kind of concern for patients that also made so many patients adoreMikovits. Lipkin had heard about a Russian guy at Pacific Medical Center with acentrifuge. Lipkin recalled:He was willing to help me, provided two things: number one, I would takeresponsibility for inserting the needles in my patient’s arm. And two, he wouldbe paid in cash—$600 up front for every treatment. So I put my guy in my FordFiesta, and I drove him over to this medical center. He could barely walk, so Iwalked him in. He lay down on this hospital bed, and I put in two large-boreneedles, one in each arm.26 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach16fn_502]Lipkin then described how the man modestly improved with this treatment, wasable to go skiing again, but eventually progressed to AIDS and died. It wasafter that experience that Lipkin decided to study infectious diseases.Although there were times when Lipkin would anger Mikovits and she would swingfrom gratitude to wanting to curse him out, it was always clear that thecompassion of that younger Lipkin was still vitally alive in him as he gotolder. He did seem like he wanted to help.* * *When Mikovits first met Dr. Ian Lipkin in his office at Columbia University inNew York City on November 4, 2010, she wore a business suit, wanting to projecta professional image to the group that would form the backbone of themulti-center study to determine whether XMRV was associated with ME/CFS.27[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach16fn_503]By contrast, Lipkin wore jeans, a button-down shirt, and sneakers, looking morelike a Silicon Valley wunderkind than a senior scientist.In that meeting in a small conference room were Lipkin, Switzer from the CDC,Harvey Alter from the National Institutes of Health, Suzanne Vernon and NancyKlimas—who were invited to the discussion on behalf of the patients anddoctors—Dr. Simone Glynn who was part of the already assembled Blood WorkingGroup, and Judy Mikovits. Dr. Cathy Laughlin, of the NIH/NIAID, which funded thestudy, was there as well. The main issue they discussed at the meeting was whichphysicians would provide samples.This was when things started to go awry.The investigators were told that each of the principal investigators (Alter,Mikovits, and Switzer) could veto a decision by the group as they were thestakeholders, but this protocol quickly broke down in practice.Lipkin, who sat at the front of the small conference table, was curt, to thepoint, always professional, but made it clear that he had taken this assignmentas a favor to Francis Collins and Harold Varmus (the head of the NCI), whowanted the study to be scientifically and ethically unassailable. Of thephysicians to select study participants, it was decided that Dan Peterson’spatients would be included but that none of the original cohort that formed thebasis of the original Science paper would be used.Incredibly to Mikovits, the top 300 patients who she had worked with in all theWPI studies would not be included. Mikovits vehemently disagreed with theinclusion of Peterson for the simple reason that his sickest patients, thosewith the most dysregulated immune systems and all of the footprints upon whichshe had built her hypothesis, would not be included. Her veto was denied.Next Klimas suggested Dr. Lucinda Bateman who Mikovits also vetoed on thegrounds that Bateman was a fibromyalgia specialist and not an ME/CFS specialist,hence increasing the danger of “idiopathic” fatigue patients or patients withoutthe same disease thrown into the mix. Bateman was the doctor Peterson sent hispatients to when they didn’t match his profile of an ME/CFS patient with naturalkiller cell and RNase L abnormalities who seemed prone to develop lymphoma.Bateman had participated in patient selection on a negative study already, soclearly the patients she treated were not those likely to have evidence of XMRVinfection.Everybody agreed that David Bell, the physician who handled the pediatricoutbreak of ME/CFS in Lyndonville, New York would be a good choice, but he hadretired. Mikovits made two suggestions: the obvious choice of Paul Cheney, andDr. Joseph Brewer, a respected doctor in the Midwest who specialized in ME/CFSand HIV/AIDS.Both were vetoed by Klimas and Vernon, under grounds that they were“controversial,” as Cheney had tried to help his patients with stem cell therapyand Brewer had suggested doing a trial of antiretrovirals.This angered Mikovits since she knew several leading physicians were prescribingthe same treatments and afraid to talk about it too loudly. Moreover, Brewer andCheney were experienced at diagnosing ME/CFS patients with evidence of XMRVinfections. The group also decided to cut from the study any patients with knownthyroiditis.But Mikovits had seen an abundance of thyroiditis and thyroid cancer in ME/CFSpatients and families with evidence of XMRV infection. She had, in fact,proposed the thyroid as a possible tissue reservoir for the virus. Mikovits feltthat excluding this population was unwarranted. When Mikovits flew home from thefirst meeting with Lipkin, she thought the study was going to be a completedisaster.From the Denver airport while on a layover she had a long conversation withAnnette Whittemore where she poured out her frustrations. Unbeknownst to her,while she was safely tucked away at the meeting, Annette had announced onlinethat VIP Dx was coming out with a serological test for XMRV shortly, usingMikovits’s name but never showing her any data or asking permission to use hername on the company website.Of course patients were excited and couldn’t wait to buy in, since it would beconcrete proof for their doctors, but it was the Whittemore’s haste that wouldagain cause Mikovits serious trouble.* * *The second time Mikovits met Lipkin she came away with a more favorableimpression than the first meeting where she’d merely felt that Klimas and Vernonhad run roughshod over him and he had not fended them off and managed themeeting. Both Lipkin and Mikovits had been asked to give a talk at the New YorkAcademy of Sciences on March 25, 2011.Opened in 1817, the New York Academy of Sciences had counted among its membersPresident Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Edison, Charles Darwin, and Albert Einstein.It currently boasts twenty-seven Nobel Laureates. Dr. Lipkin was also a member.The event where they were invited to speak was a series of lectures on theominous topic, “Pathogens in the Blood Supply.”Lipkin’s talk was “Microbe Hunting” and Mikovits’s was “Strategies for Detectionof XMRV in Blood.” Prior to the event, Lipkin had not discussed his presentationwith Mikovits, but she had a general idea of the type of talk he was likely togive.As she listened to his presentation, it seemed to her that he had specificallycrafted the perfect lead-in for her. He recounted his discovery of West NileVirus, how it had been a difficult virus to detect and caused a controversyamong public health officials who had failed to take quick action, allowing thevirus to spread much farther than it should have. He again reiterated his ideathat most of the pathogens that were easily detectable had already been found:the future belonged to scientists who used the latest technological tools tofollow the “footprints” of these elusive viruses and bacteria to their lairs,the true tracker-hunters of virology.Mikovits felt a shiver of excitement, knowing she was on such a prestigiousstage with the world’s most famous virus hunter setting up her presentation.Lipkin finished up, turned to her and said, “Go get ‘em, tiger!”* * *Afterward, Lipkin approached her and said his team wanted to take both her andAnnette to dinner. They had a pleasant meal and Mikovits saw another side toLipkin. He talked about his role as a consultant for the movie, Contagion,directed by Steven Soderbergh. The movie was a fictionalized version of the SARSoutbreak in China, in which Lipkin led the investigation.Mikovits talked about Frank Ruscetti and their common difficulties with Gallo.She told Lipkin she was never going to accept an order she believed wasunethical or immoral, no matter who gave it.Lipkin mentioned he wanted to retire in five years to pursue other interestsoutside of science. Joining them that evening was Lipkin’s collaborator, Dr.Mady Horning, who was widely expected to take over the Center for Infection andImmunity when Lipkin retired. Hornig had a child with autism and had to excuseherself early to relieve her babysitter.By the time the dinner was over, Mikovits had warmed up to the charming Lipkin.She had seen some evidence of his reputation for arrogance at their firstmeeting, how he was a “take-charge” kind of guy, but he reminded Mikovits of herfather in many ways. Once his shell was cracked, Lipkin’s good heart andcompassion were evident.The two of them might never become the best of friends, but Lipkin was a personshe could respect, work with, and with whom she might even enjoy a lively dinnerdiscussion.* * *As the attacks on XMRV increased in the months after that night, and thecriticisms expanded from detection of retroviral sequences being nothing morethan mouse contamination, to include a recombinant virus that had been createdin the lab in the early 1990s with no natural history of infection, Lipkin roseto her defense and showed his “take-charge” persona also meant he could hold theline for a scientist treated unfairly.When Mikovits got back from the scene at the 2011 Belgium retroviral conference,where scientists had shouted, “Stop spending money on these people!” there wasan email from Lipkin telling her, “Judy, ignore the noise, and simply focus onthe science.”Lipkin was, in fact so concerned that he offered to come out to the WPI to showhis support and confidence in the work. Since it was already mid-June then andAnnette and her family always went away for summer vacation in the month ofJuly, they had to scramble to find a suitable time frame. They settled on Lipkinflying out to the WPI from New York on June 24, and staying for three days.During that time he toured the labs, conducted a physician’s roundtable, andgave an open address in the WPI auditorium that was open to the public and thusexpected to attract local ME/CFS patients. But Mikovits was miffed when heconducted just a cursory tour of her research lab, with a dismissive, “If you’veseen one research lab, you’ve seen them all,” and then choosing to spend a greatdeal of time at the clinical lab, VIP Dx.She later found out that Lipkin had been very concerned by failings in theLombardi-run clinical lab, and even wrote a twelve-page letter to theWhittemores about these problems. His cursory interest in her research labturned out to be a confidence in the quality of her work.Harvey and Annette seemed to make sure that one of them always shadowed Lipkin.Mikovits was familiar with the Whittemore charm offensive and expected as much.The night before the physician’s roundtable and Lipkin’s public talk at the WPI,the Whittemores hosted a dinner for him, inviting Mikovits, Ruscetti, as well asJamie Deckoff-Jones, the former emergency room doctor who had contracted ME/CFSand about whom the New York Times reported: “Some ME/CFS patients are alreadytrying HIV medications prescribed ‘off label.’ One patient, Jamie Deckoff-Jones,a physician in Santa Fe, N.M., has been keeping a popular blog about herimproving health while taking antiretrovirals prescribed by her doctor. ‘I thinkthe sickest patients have the right to try the drugs,’ she commented.”28[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach16fn_504]Deckoff-Jones had recently been named director of clinical services for theWhittemore Peterson Institute when negotiations had stalled out with PaulCheney.Harvey gestured the server to pour expensive bottles of wine for Lipkin, whofancied himself a connoisseur, while others sipped their own drinks. Thelibations loosened everybody’s tongues, and Lipkin started expressing opinionsthat offended Mikovits.Lipkin declared it just short of criminal that some physicians were prescribingantiretrovirals for ME/CFS. Mikovits glanced sideways toward Deckoff-Jones, whowouldn’t have been able to sit up for a whole social dinner in the year beforeshe had started on antiretroviral therapies: she was living proof why Lipkin’swords were dangerous.Mikovits also thought of Michael Synderman, effectively treating both his CFSand cancer with antiretrovirals. Lipkin went on about why people like Brewerwith his antiretrovirals and Cheney with his stem cells weren’t serving thepatient population. Mikovits soon reached her limit. She threw her napkin in thechair and stormed out, refusing to return to the table. Lipkin seemed baffled asto how he had offended her.“Well, you just insulted pretty much everything she’s done in her career,”declared Frank Ruscetti, “including her association with me.”Lipkin backpedaled and seemed genuinely contrite, promising to apologize thenext day. Unlike Judy, Frank believed Lipkin’s influence was so huge that theyhad to swallow any anger.The next day Lipkin arrived a half-hour late for the Physicians Round Table,cutting it short for Lipkin’s public presentation in the large auditorium at theWPI.Mikovits felt she’d heard most of the speech before—the need to follow the“immune footprints” of the virus, and so on—yet smiled when Lipkin told theassembled group about the technology he possessed at Columbia and challenged,“Give me a million dollars and I’ll find this virus!”Many local ME/CFS patients showed up for his talk. A few were being pushed inwheelchairs by caregivers with ready oxygen tanks. Afterward, many patientsapproached Lipkin in the lobby, shook his hand, and gushed how appreciative theywere that he was trying to help. Although Mikovits was incensed about theconversation the night before, she witnessed a shift in his expression. Afterthe group left, Lipkin approached her. “CFS patients aren’t supposed to be inwheelchairs,” he said, obviously shaken by how disabled they were.“The ones we see are,” she answered somberly.They talked for a few more minutes and she genuinely thanked him for coming.Harvey whisked Lipkin away to the airport, where the world’s most celebratedvirus hunter hopped his plane to the Big Apple.* * *"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENTEENThe Name Game and the “Immaculate Recombination”How many have we created, John? How many XMRVs are out there?—Judy Mikovits1 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach17fn_505]There’s an old joke about a man who goes over to his neighbor’s house to borrowa lawnmower. “I’m sorry,” the neighbor replies as he stands in his driveway nearthe mouth of his open garage, “but I lent it to my cousin who lives on the otherside of town.”But the man sees the lawnmower in plain sight, just on the other side of hisneighbor’s bike propped on a garage wall. “But it’s right there,” argues theman.“What does the reason matter?” asks the neighbor. “I’m never going to give it toyou anyway.”In her research on XMRV, Mikovits would often feel like the man in the old jokeasking to borrow his neighbor’s lawnmower. The reason for her lack of supportnever seemed to matter. No one in authority would consider the notion that aretrovirus was associated with ME/CFS, regardless of the evidence she and otherspresented. She suspected the scientific hierarchy had already made the decisionthat retroviruses were not involved in ME/CFS, and they would not bend.* * *Mikovits remembered all too well the stories of Frank Ruscetti from 1970s whenhe was working as a postdoc in the Gallo lab. Coffin and most of the otherfamous scientists in the field emphatically told him not to bother because therewere no such things as human retroviruses.Ruscetti and Bernie Poiesz were presenting their research at the 1980 ColdSprings Harbor conference that indeed they’d isolated HTLV-1, an infectioushuman retrovirus from patients with Adult T Cell Leukemia (ATL). It was soheretical that Gallo, who always attended the CSH meeting in those days and hadpromised to come, never showed up, leaving Bernie and Frank to face anydissonant music themselves.David Baltimore and Howard Temin, who both received the Nobel Prize for thediscovery of reverse transcriptase, and other giants of the field usually sat inthe front row. Coffin had worked in the Temin lab as a postdoc and publishedwith him in 1971.2 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach17fn_506]More than half a century had been spent trying to unlock the secrets of thefirst known animal retrovirus.Ruscetti and Poiesz’s presentation of their isolation of the first humanretrovirus had been slated for the Sunday morning of the 1980 CSH gathering. Atthat time, any session about human retroviruses was always held on Sundaymorning, after all the important people had already left and very few of theinfluential leaders of the field stuck around.The majority of the remaining audience greeted their findings with silence,while the anti-human retrovirus critics simply walked out. It reminded Ruscettiof the tense walkout for Robert Koch when he give a lengthy dissertation of hisdiscovery on the TB-causing bacteria. All the great German scientists likeRudolf Virchow who had been critics just exited without a word.After the discovery of HTLV-1, Coffin hadn’t been much of a factor in Ruscetti’slife for the last three and a half decades except when they criss-crossed atconferences.Mikovits really didn’t have much of an opinion about Coffin until he showed upas one of the organizers of the hastily called July 22, 2009, meeting at theNIH, prior to the publication of the Science article. Perhaps Coffin was brieflyworried that he hadn’t pursued relevant data on other retroviral sequenceswitnessed thirty years ago. Maybe that was when he decided to write theaccompanying editorial in Science, entitled “A New Virus for Old Diseases.”3[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach17fn_507]Brigitte Huber, who had a laboratory near Coffin at Tufts, first suggested thatXMRV was mere mouse contamination at the XMRV Workshop at the Cleveland Clinicin November of 2009. She said that in some very preliminary testing she had notbeen able to find evidence of the XMRV retrovirus sequence as defined bySilverman and DeRisi. Her explanation for the failure was that the labsinvolved—the Cleveland Clinic, the National Cancer Institute, and the WhittemorePeterson Institute—must have inadvertently had small pieces of mouse droppings,blood, or hair, that had somehow found their way into the testing materials.Ruscetti thought that Huber was a stalking horse for Coffin.Mikovits and Ruscetti wittily dubbed it the “Mouse Crap Theory” of XMRV. Thesituation had started to spiral out of control and somebody needed to put a stopto it.The Cold Springs Harbor Retrovirology Conference of May 2010 was something of acounterstrike when Alter and Lo reported the confirmation of the Science paperas well as their unpublished findings of a larger family of mouse (murine)leukemia viruses present in these patients.However, publication of their confirmation study had been cagily delayed, whilethe negative study by the CDC by Switzer zipped through to publication like itwas on a jetstream, the eventual publication of the Lo/Alter paper in August of2010 finally seemed to debunk and mark the death-knell of the “Mouse CrapTheory,” turning it back to compost.Francis Collins’s decision that the data presented at the First InternationalConference on XMRV now required a multi-center study to reconcile the positiveand negative studies under the direction of Lipkin further undercut the “MouseCrap” theory of Coffin and his cronies.Coffin attended the November 4, 2010, meeting with Lipkin to set up themulti-center study. He sat on the other side of the conference table fromMikovits, disengaged from her, although the end of the meeting presented anawkward comedic opportunity.4 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach17fn_508]Right then, Harvey Alter asked if anybody wanted to share a ride to the airport.Mikovits and Coffin said yes so they all squeezed into the back of a cab.Because she was smaller than them, Mikovits was flanked in the back seat byCoffin on her left and Alter on her right.Alter was friendly, asking how a cancer and AIDS researcher had become involvedin ME/CFS. She told him the story and he listened with complete attention. Bycontrast, Coffin on her left huddled up against the left window, ignoring theirpresence.5 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach17fn_509]* * *Coffin’s impending publications would support the mouse contamination theory.Despite the Lo/Alter findings, the drumbeat of contamination accusationscontinued, bolstered by the journal Retrovirology, edited by Kuan-Teh Jeang,which published five articles on December 22, 2010, reporting the presence ofmouse DNA into human materials and PCR reagent kits, as well as presence of MLVsequences in some widely used reagents. Others reported that sequences givingrise to clones of Silverman XMRV were identical to those in the prostate cellline 22Rv1.As a reviewer of one the five papers that he thought needed more work to warrantpublication, Ruscetti was annoyed when it was published anyway, but Jeang toldhim that together the five papers supported one another, thus they surely didn’tneed the same level of vetting the Mikovits paper had gone through with Science.Shortly after those papers came out in the winter of 2010–2011, Ruscetti wasunexpectedly called into a meeting in his supervisor’s office, the head ofCenter for Cancer Research (CCR), with Coffin and six of his colleagues.At that time, Coffin and Dr. Vinay Pathak presented their evidence thatSilverman’s XMRV was actually a laboratory-generated virus as a result of arecombination between what they called preXMRV-1 and Pre XMRV-2.6[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach17fn_510] This recombination had such a low chance ofoccurring that XMRV in any specimens that contained evidence of XMRV must havebeen contaminated through routine lab procedures like tissue culture andconcluded there was no evidence that people or any animal species were naturallyinfected by XMRV.This meant to them that all the positive data had either to be a result ofcontamination with mouse products or a laboratory-made viral artifact generatedby recombination. Coffin told Frank Ruscetti that “Science started this andScience will end it.”Ruscetti thought to himself then, “What had Science started?”Their paper had gone through standard review process and then a few other hoopsand had not been Coffin part of “starting it” as author of the news and viewsaccompanying the paper? As far as Ruscetti was concerned, if recombinationtheory was true, it was the first time a retrovirus infecting human cells andhad no natural history of infecting people was created in the lab, who couldhave known beforehand?Nobody would have then “started it”—it would have been a self-generatingaccident resulting in exotic biology for which no scientist is responsible forknowing.The State of the Knowledge Conference in April of 2011 was the next opportunityfor Mikovits and Coffin to spend considerable time together, and the patient andscientific communities seemed to have chosen their champion.Mikovits felt there was no room for personality squabbles and preferred to focuson healthy scientific debate. If somebody could come up with a good argumentbacked up with data that didn’t completely rewrite the rules of retrovirology,she was ready to listen to any refutation.But as the “Mouse Crap Theory” of contamination continued to crumble, assistedby a German study that found that about 10 percent of immune-compromisedpatients in that country had XMRV sequences in nasal swabs, the argument ofdoubters again started to swing toward the XMRV recombination theory.* * *In addition to the “Mouse Crap Theory,” doubters who took the tack of thatjoke’s projecting husband came up with a second theory, which could best bedescribed as “Holy Mouse Crap!—We Created a New Retrovirus!”The theory was that XMRV was a lab-created retrovirus (a “recombinant virus”),the type of deformed sci-fi monster that would strike mortal panic into thegeneral public, but added caveats: We don’t know if this recombinant retrovirushas ever infected people. If it has infected people, we think the normal humanimmune system would keep it from being a problem. Remain calm. The guardians ofpublic health will get to the bottom of all this!From the beginning of their investigation the Mikovits Ruscetti labs had neverbeen able to find Silverman’s XMRV. The only evidence of that sequence in thepaper was done in Silverman lab. It was only when she’d told her researchassociate Max Pfost to relax the PCR conditions did they detect sequencesrelated to XMRV-Silverman. They had, in other words, been looking in the generallibrary, but needed to open the secret door behind a bookcase to get to thehidden editions.At one point during their face-off at the State of the Knowledge workshop inApril of 2011, Coffin made a statement that puzzled Mikovits even years later.As she went over the various pieces of information supporting an XMRV infection,including the electron micrographs, the immune response from multiple proteins,and strain differences when sequencing larger parts of the envelope of thevirus, Coffin said in a very heated voice, “I’m not saying it isn’t anotherretrovirus, I’m just saying it’s not that retrovirus!”7[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach17fn_511]Was this all just some kind of name game?What did it matter to the millions who suffered from chronic ME/CFS, themillions with prostate cancer, and possibly the millions of children with autismand other neurological problems if there were variations in the retroviralsequences? Virus strains could have variations in the genetic sequences. Fromthe beginning they’d been suspicious as the full-length sequence of XMRV inpatients was only done in Silverman’s lab.DeRisi and Silverman hadn’t named the virus based on the classification of thesequence. They called it xenotropic because it wasn’t found in a mouse, meaningit had leapt species. It had been found in human prostate tissue. Nobody knewthen that the sequences were not actually in the tissue but in the RNA made(cloned) from the tissue. It was a murine leukemia related-virus because itlooked like a mouse retrovirus. DeRisi had laid it all out during his TED talkin 2006 when he talked about his ViroChip technology.8[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach17fn_512]Mikovits couldn’t help but wonder if all of the shifty semantics with Silvermanand DeRisi were an attempt to control intellectual property that could be worthsubstantial fame and money after a giant discovery.Was Coffin interested in un-discovering XMRV so he could later re-discover it?At one point during the roundtable discussion while Coffin was talking aboutcontamination, Mikovits had finally had enough. She said, “These people aren’tcontaminated! They’re infected! They make antibodies! An immune response is nota contaminant! I don’t really care if you call it contamination or infection,but these people need a treatment!”Antibodies are not cell phones picking up signals from tissues in a faraway lab.Why wasn’t anyone listening to her explanation about the antibodies? Sufferingpatients needed help.* * *Mikovits and Coffin both presented their points with searing passion. In the OldBoys’ network, Mikovits had to go by different rules: a woman could not be toofiery, and passion for patients was immediately viewed as overly soft (towardthe “phobic, hysterical, maladaptive” patients in her case) and unscientific.When it came time to do a wrap-up, Harvey Alter was troubled.9[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach17fn_513] He took Mikovits into a backroom and said,“Judy, what do I do? He’s so vehement that this is recombination orcontamination, or something. What do you make of all this?”In the time she’d come to know Harvey Alter, she found him to be a decent,mild-mannered man who lived for the integrity of the scientific process. LikeAlter, she was convinced there had been no evidence of contamination in a singleexperiment. She had been fully transparent with all data since day one. Mikovitsand Ruscetti did not cherry pick the data.Mikovits had insisted on leaving conflicting data in figure 1 even whenSilverman wanted it removed. Ruscetti stood by Mikovits. They had done all ofthe proper controls. The confounding data, which showed one sample 1118 negativefor gag or env sequences but positive in another test for Env and Gag proteinsremained in figure 1. She walked through the science again. If it wascontamination, how could you explain the antibody response? What about thesequence variation and the proteins detected by a monoclonal antibody thatrecognized all family members ever tested? They’d been able to take two slightlydifferent viruses out of the same person, separated by a period of years (thusindicating it was not a one-time lab event).The proteins of the virus had come straight from un-manipulated tissue and theelectron micrographs of the virus budding from the cells were difficult todismiss. How could that have been contamination?Eventually, Alter sighed and said, “Well, I’ve got the unpleasant task ofsumming this up.” She shrugged. As the sports expression went, she’d left it allon the field. Alter had the ball now.* * *Alter gave an excellent summation of the two competing theories. Mikovits knewAlter had been momentarily troubled but his anxiety had melted into pure grace.He was well-informed, funny, and humble in the way a scientist should be in theface of things he does not fully understand.Alter began, “When two women claim to be the mother of the same child, KingSolomon made a judgment to cut the baby in half and resolve the dilemma, and itwas resolved when the real mother gave up her share to save the baby’s life.Well, I’m no Solomon, but I’m stuck here between the diametrically opposedviewpoints of Judy Mikovits and John Coffin, both of whose science I greatlyrespect, and I don’t truthfully know who to cut or what to cut, except that I’dlike to cut out of here.10 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach17fn_514]” The audiencelaughed at Alter’s endearing discomfort. They had their own jitters.Were they looking at a new pandemic like AIDS, or had this all been someterrible misunderstanding or misinterpretation of data? Alter said he’d try toreview the two presentations and see where they led. He talked about how gag andenv sequences for XMRV and closely related viruses in dramatically highernumbers in ME/CFS patients than in controls and had also detected antibodies inthe majority of the patients and there was no evidence of contamination.11[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach17fn_515]Alter was summarizing beautifully. The gag and env sequences were translatedinto viral proteins unique to this pathogen and she was finding sequences ofgreater diversity, which was an indirect argument against contamination thatscientists should have understood.Contaminants usually don’t show wide genetic diversity, but are more “one note.”Evolution generally proceeds at a predictable rate and thus the finding ofsequence variation was another indicator that this virus had been present inhumans for some time.The finding of antibodies in the patients with these gag and env sequences waskey since antibodies are only generated in a human body as the immune systemresponds to a perceived invader. Antibodies could not be generated in a testtube.Mikovits had been able to detect XMRV sequences and proteins in samplescollected at different times from the same patient, thus lowering thepossibility of a mistaken result. Her team had also cultured virus from bloodcells and unmanipulated plasma, and tested again and again for contamination andfound no evidence of it. They had tried to make it fail-safe.Alter continued, now discussing the Coffin data.What Alter was describing at this point was the beginning of the shift away fromthe “Mouse Crap Theory” of XMRV to the “Holy Mouse Crap!—We Created aRetrovirus! But Don’t Worry, It’s Not Dangerous!” theory that Coffin would nowput forth as the main objection to the work of Mikovits and Ruscetti.Coffin was continuing with the “Mouse Crap Theory” of contamination by claiminghe’d found evidence of mouse mitochondrial DNA in his assays, but was shiftingthe argument by claiming a recombinant mouse-human retrovirus was possiblyinfecting 22RV1, a prostate cancer cell line. This cell-line was widely used andit was reasonable to suspect this was the reason for the results reported in thepositive studies, although Alter mentioned it had not been in the Mikovits lab.Alter continued with Coffin’s argument that XMRV had been created in a lab:“He further shows that XMRV might be a hybrid, a recombinant of two pre-XMRVviruses, one of them, which is replication competent, the other of which is not,and if you put these two together it almost perfectly matches XMRV.”12[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach17fn_516]A “pathogenic exogenous” virus is one which can infect the organism and spreadto other organisms of the same species and cause disease. But eventually overtime as Darwin’s ruthless “survival of the fittest” works its way through aspecies, those who survive at the highest rates are the people who have renderedthe virus harmless. They are many ways to do this.The immune system can learn how to destroy the virus. Some can vary the receptorthat a specific virus uses. As they’d discovered with the “elite controllers” inHIV/AIDS, some lacked a receptor, which would allow the HIV retrovirus to gainaccess to the cells and cause disease.The most common defense (thousands of retroviruses have been renderednonpathogenic this way) is to silence the virus and eventually cause enoughchanges that it is no longer a competent virus A virus, which had become“endogenized” meant it was present in the host genome and could be passed tooffspring but had lost the ability to harm that organism.Specifically, Coffin was suggesting that the passage of prostate cancer tissuethrough a certain species of laboratory mice, (the “nude mice”) had generated anew hybrid replication-competent (able to reproduce) retrovirus that matchedvery well with the XMRV sequences reported by Silverman. Alter continued withhis summation of Coffin’s argument:“Thus, Coffin claimed that XMRV evolved when XMRV-negative prostate cancerxenografts were passaged in these nude mice and then became infected over time.That XMRV is a recombinant of two pre-XMRV strains, only one of which isreplication competent, that XMRV was created in a lab long after ME/CFS wasrecognized as a clinical entity, and that XMRV is a contaminant that does notwarrant further study. This was a second kind of contamination.”13[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach17fn_517]These relatively brief restatements by Alter described the central battlefieldwhere Mikovits and Coffin would fight it out over the next six months beforetheir confrontation at the Ottawa meeting in September 2011.In spite of the fury of their arguments, they did agree on important components.Mikovits had no difficulty believing that the XMRV sequences as found bySilverman in his prostate cancer sample tissues had been generated by thepassage of prostate cancer tissue through nude mice as described by Coffin.Coffin was alleging that there was a Frankenstein-like recombinant retrovirusrelated to mouse xenotropic virus that had been created in a lab and readilyinfected human cells, but that scientists shouldn’t worry about this freakmonster.The unanswered question to Mikovits was that if one recombinant retrovirus hadbeen created through the passage of human tissue through mice tissue, how manyothers had been created in the last fifty years of human /mousexenotransplantation?Could something very similar have been created by an earlier passage of humantissue through mice in another lab?Why couldn’t that question be asked?Why was Coffin arguing that XMRV was a contaminant that didn’t need to bestudied any further? Wasn’t that an abandonment of scientific curiosity, apatronizing parent telling his scientific “children” there was no monster underthe bed?Alter continued with his summation:“So, where do we go with these two very divergent pieces of data? I do want togive you this cautionary note, the fact that contamination can occur, and nobodydoubts that, does not mean that it has occurred in any given laboratory. Thereis as yet no direct evidence for contamination in either the Mikovits lab or theLo laboratory.So, what are we going to do? I think, rather that cutting the baby in half, theresolution may come—first of all we have to resolve this issue, is itcontaminant or is it real, and I think that it will be addressed by two codedpanels that are currently in preparation.”14[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach17fn_518]The answer was that there would be two investigations, one by the NationalHeart, Lung and Blood Insitute. (this would be known as the Blood WorkingGroup). and a second investigation funded by the National Institute for Allergyand Infectious Diseases (headed by Anthony Fauci), which would come to be knownas the Lipkin multi-center study.15 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach17fn_519]Many in the ME/CFS community were skeptical about Fauci, an opinion described byCort Johnson’s Phoenix Rising website, when he wrote that Fauci:“has been no friend to ME/CFS—in fact, he’s been considered a major problem foryears. He appointed Stephen Strauss to head the CFS team in the 1980s and movedfor ME/CFS to get kicked out of the Institute ten years ago, an event which leadto years of research declines as the program slowly disintegrated in thebackwater that is the little Office for Research on Women’s Health.”16[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach17fn_520]Mikovits hoped Fauci wouldn’t have too much influence over the investigation.The selection of patients who’d never been tested for XMRV concerned her. Ifthere was contamination it would have taken place in the lab as the samples werebeing processed.To do a replication study, the logical step was to go back to those patients whohad previously tested positive. There was a possibility their samples could havebeen contaminated, but the patients would not have been contaminated by a needlestick, so newly-drawn samples processed in a different lab would not showcontamination. Once positive by this redundant method, they were clearlyinfected. To Mikovits it seemed there was an awful lot of effort going intoreinventing the wheel. The very process itself, called into question the group’sintention. In the months and years to come she’d wonder if their intentionhadn’t been to actually invent a square and proclaim a wheel had never existed.Alter finished up his summation:“So I think that’s where we stand. These panels are going to come late thisspring, early summer. They’ll take quite a while to do, because they are socomplex, but hopefully we’ll have some answers this year.”The audience members applauded warmly. Alter ended by noting that it was late ona Friday afternoon, but he wanted to give Mikovits the opportunity to makeconcluding remarks. She did have a few things she wanted to remind the assembledgroup.“. . . We took the systems biology approach, collected samples from well-definedpatients who had the infectious characteristics that Tony Komaroff talked about,that were in the Lo study, that Dan Peterson had done, these patients had dataon them for decades.We took samples over three years. So it wasn’t that we found the sample in everysample indicated—like the macaque study where it quickly went into the tissue,like the mouse study that came out this week that said that the antibodyresponses were weak and transient. We don’t know everything about this virus,but HIV does not cause AIDS. The CDC definition is HIV and one of 25co-pathogens, so the Lyme, the EBV, the enteroviruses . . .We’ve developed a cytokine signature that is distinct from Nancy’s (Klimas)cytokine signature and from Ben Nadleson so this is a marker to follow onclinical trial improvement.”17 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach17fn_521]If one used HIV as a template for the damage this retrovirus caused it fit likea glove. The CDC’s own definition of AIDS was infection with the HIV retrovirusand one of twenty-five other co-pathogens, including Lyme, Epstein-Barr virus,and a host of others.It made sense then that antivirals, antibiotics, or similar medications, whichwent after some of these co-pathogens, would have the effect of lessening theseverity of the disease (just as they did with AIDS). They were developinginflammatory cytokine signatures, which would allow them to figure out whichmedications might be most effective for each individual patient.In the view of Mikovits the future beckoned with hope for treatment of thesepatients if the researchers would but open their eyes, remember their training,and see the evidence in front of them. She continued:Whatever their disease is, they are infected and sick, and I know John Chia haspatients that are coinfected [with enteroviruses] and they don’t treat the sameway. So we can get together with the physicians who have coinfected patients,even Lyme doctors who we’re working with across the country, and start doingsomething now, take it out of CFS. It’s not about CFS, it’s about a retroviruswe don’t understand very well. As Frank Ruscetti said in a meeting a month or soago, if this were HIV, it would be 1983. That’s all.18[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach17fn_522]Mikovits’s urgency made perfect sense, as did her statement that the apparentretrovirus plus coinfections they were seeing put them in a time capsule,trapped like AIDS patients in 1983, when the scientific grasp of the illness wasinitially like the blind man and the elephant parable, with researchers onlyseeing a tail but not an ear (or one coinfection but not another): patients hadbeen suffering for decades, and viable, safe, and effective treatments might bealready approved.But even though AIDS had thrust the term “fast tracking” into the scientificlexicon to refer to the urgency of getting medications to needed patients, andeven though the FDA soon declared ME/CFS to be a “serious or life-threatening”condition, dealing with affected ME/CFS patients was hugely controversial inretroviral research.Some physicians would argue that antiretrovirals, even though they’d beenprescribed for the better part of two decades and ME/CFS still lackedFDA-approved drugs of its own, presented unacceptable risks, and should not beused until more definitive information was available. This was the position IanLipkin had taken.But she had seen how devastating the condition could be, and Mikovits alsothought it was perfectly reasonable for people to attempt to use antiretroviralsunder an astute doctor’s care. The same drugs were given to pregnant women withHIV and their children to insure the mothers didn’t give their kids AIDS.She felt a trial of antiretrovirals—drugs that had received rigorous trials andfunding, with proven use around the globe—was perfectly reasonable for patientswith a “serious and life-threatening” condition. Mikovits told the assembledgroup that even if they didn’t think anti-retrovirals were medically sound, theycould consider interventions like immune-modulators with a better safetyprofile. Mikovits thought the research should be accelerated.Mikovits felt that Coffin seemed intent on burying it.* * *The unpublished research that John Coffin had referenced at the May 2011 Stateof the Knowledge Conference at the NIH finally came out in Science on June 1,2011. The title was “Recombinant Origins of the Retrovirus XMRV”19[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach17fn_523] and while Mikovits may have questioned theresearch, especially since they were focusing so much on Silverman’s VP62 cloneof XMRV, his conclusions particularly alarmed her.“The retrovirus XMRV (xenotropic murine leukemia virus–related virus) has beendetected in human prostate tumors and in blood samples from patients with CFS,but these findings have not been replicated. We hypothesized that anunderstanding of when and how XMRV first arose might help explain the discrepantresults . . .. . . We conclude that XMRV was not present in the original CWR22 tumor but wasgenerated by recombination of two proviruses during tumor passaging in mice.”20[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach17fn_524]Coffin was suggesting XMRV might have been created by the passage of humanprostate cancer tissue through mice. They were able to find XMRV in the prostatecancer cell lines and it was their belief that XMRV was created by the“recombination of two proviruses during tumor passaging in mice.” The authorsemphasized that the probably of this exact recombination was so low that itwould never occur again.Mikovits couldn’t help but think that her colleagues had all lost theircollective mind. Didn’t they see the foretold danger in their words? Did thisresearch actually make them feel safe containment had taken place? For Mikovitsthis could be a possible catastrophe.Coffin’s work, at face value, showed that a replication-competent retrovirus hadbeen inadvertently created by passing human tissue through mice. A month later apublication from Adi Gazdar’s team showed that murine leukemia viruses from manydifferent laboratory lines could become airborne, infecting human cells grown inthe same lab. No retrovirus had ever demonstrated the ability to efficientlyspread through the air, so this was alarming. The virus didn’t generate much ofan immune response and disappeared quickly from the blood and moved intotissues.With all of this information, Coffin was still suggesting this was a novel,singular event, something that—while unprecedented in scientifichistory—deserved absolutely no further investigation.Mikovits believed Coffin was effectively claiming that this event was somethingakin to an “Immaculate Recombination,” an event so unprecedented and rare inhistory that it would be a waste of future research dollars. But Alter and Lo’sconfirmatory study had found something very close to what Silverman had reportedas XMRV, not Silverman’s sequences. Mikovits’s conclusions from the data werethe opposite of Coffin’s.A potentially airborne, recombinant retrovirus had to be studied.It was unlikely to be “immaculate” or “one-time only.” More likely was that ithad happened before, maybe not XMRV but closely related viruses. Scientists hadbeen passaging human tissue through mice for more than seventy years. Was thistruly the first time retroviruses had recombined? What said that recombinationevents had to lead to the exact same replication-competent virus? Scientistslived in fear that the next pandemic would occur when a virus might jump fromone species to another among animals living on a farm.For decades, they might have been accelerating that process by passing tissuefrom humans directly through animals. Had they fully understood theramifications of what they were doing?This was why, during the Ottawa Conference of August 2011, Mikovits asked theimportant question “How many have we created, John? How many XMRVs are outthere?”21 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach17fn_525] But it didn’t seem anyone wasinterested in the question."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHTEENWhittemore JusticeWhittemore’s former partners at Wingfield Nevada Group—Tom Seeno and AlbertSeeno Jr.—have sued Whittemore, saying he used his smooth-talking,sleight-of-hand tactics to steal millions from the Wingfield company. Whittemoreshot back with his own lawsuit claiming the Seenos threatened to kill him andhis family if he didn’t follow their orders and sign over his assets.1[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_526]—Martha Bellisle, “Wit and Work madeLobbyist, Harvey Whittemore, ‘An Institution.’”Reno Gazette Journal, February 12, 2012A federal grand jury indicted former Nevada power broker Harvey Whittemore todayon charges of funneling $138,000 to an elected official’s campaign throughfamily members and employees and then lying to the FBI about it, the USAttorney’s office said.2 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_527]—David McGrath Schwartz, “Federal GrandJury Indicts Former Nevada Power Broker HarveyWhittemore,” Las Vegas Sun, June 6, 2012Dr. Mikovits was at the Physicians Round Table in Tampa, Florida in late January2012 when she heard about the forty-four million dollar Seeno lawsuit againstthe Whittemores.3 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_528] Since the suit was publicrecord, she hurried to download it and poured over the forty-two page complaintthat named Harvey Whittemore, Annette Whittemore, and the Lakeshore HouseLimited Partnership, which took its name from their historic home in lushGlenbrook.4 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_529]The mystery of the previous year when she had seen such a change in theWhittemores came into stark relief. She thought of the time in late March 2011,when she had begun to see an unsavory side of the Whittemores, but this was awhole new scale. She thought she had been in a world of wealth and privilegewith sincere dedication to unraveling neuro-immune diseases. The accusations inthe lawsuit painted a picture of a dark and dangerous world:This is a case involving the misappropriation, breach of fiduciary duties andembezzlement of tens of millions of dollars. Acting as manager of Wingfield,Whittemore has admitted and confessed to engaging in over 20 different financialtransactions designed to deplete Wingfield of its assets for the sole purpose ofenhancing and promoting Whittemore’s financial condition and to further hisstanding in the political community of Nevada.5[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_530]The Seenos alleged ten causes of action against the Whittemores, includingbreach of fiduciary duties, breach of contract, civil conspiracy, and unjustenrichment. In early 2004, the Whittemores and Seenos forged a businesspartnership and the Whittemores sold fifty percent of their interest in variouscompanies to the Seenos, including Argus Media, Wild West Sound Company, RedlabsUSA (since 2007 DBA VIP Dx), Dr. Pepper/7-Up Bottling Company of the West, andtwo companies associated with the massive Coyote Springsdevelopment-in-planning.All of these entities became part of the newly formed Wingfield Nevada GroupHolding Company that was created on or around January 1, 2005. Harvey Whittemorewas a manager of the Holding Company and, according to the Seeno lawsuit, “FromFebruary of 2007 through 2009, Whitemore exercised complete control over thefinancial books and records of Wingfield.”6 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_531]Around September of 2010 the Seenos began to notice financial discrepancies:In or around September 2010, the Seenos confronted Whittemore with theirsuspicions. However, they quickly learned their suspicions, while well-founded,had not even scratched the surface of Whittemore’s fraud, deception, andmalfeasance. Confronted with some of the evidence uncovered regarding hispotential fraudulent conduct, breach of fiduciary duties, and misdeeds,Whittemore confessed, admitted, and disclosed a multitude of acts that revealedyears of theft, conversion, asset misappropriation, and breach of fiduciaryduties to Wingfield.7 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_532]According to the lawsuit, Harvey Whittemore himself had prepared a writtenconfession of his misdeeds on September 16, 2010, and gave it to the Seenorepresentatives.8 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_533] Mikovits could not getover the irony of the situation. Harvey had tried to get her to sign aconfession (in the form of an apology) in order to get her out of jail, and wrapup the civil case. She had refused. Now the Seenos were claiming he had writtenhis own confession regarding the theft of millions. As Mikovits read about thevarious monies allegedly embezzled by Harvey from Wingfield, the story got moreincredible. To her surprise, she stumbled upon her own name in the Seenolawsuit:For example, Defendant Annette Whittemore, who lacked management authority underWingfield, mandated to the Wingfield accounting staff that 75% of the salary ofDr. Judy Mikovitz (sp.), a research scientist and employee of WPI, would becharged to and paid by Wingfield.9 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_534]She had no idea she was indirectly salaried by the Wingfield company. In 2006she had gone with Annette Whittemore to appear before the Nevada statelegislature to raise funds for the new institute. They were granted six hundredthousand dollars for each of the first two years and four hundred thousanddollars for the two years after that, for a total of two million dollars infunds that included salary for Mikovits and the start-up staff. Herunderstanding was that her salary came from these funds and the Whittemorefamily foundation. But if the Whittemores had not used the state money to payfor Institute staff, and instead took salaries out of Wingfield, where had itgone?She called her attorneys, thinking this revelation meant things could turn inher favor. Her hearing on damages was set for a few days away. Maybe it wouldnow never happen. The Seeno lawsuit was seemed to be unmasking Whittemore lies,but even in the volley of lawsuits her attorneys were still dismissive. “Thesecharges have nothing to do with your case,” they told her.* * *A few days later, the Whittemores filed a countersuit against the Seenos,claiming that the Seenos owned them sixty million dollars.10[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_535] This amount of damages claimed by theWhittemores would later balloon to $1.8 billion dollars.11[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_536]Mikovits delved into reading Whittemore’s litigation as well, and it clarifiedsome of the inexplicable moments she had observed in the last year of her workfor the Whittemores. She recalled in April of 2011 when Annette Whittemore hadmissed a meeting by a couple of hours. Annette typically appeared at the WPI incrisp business suits, her hair nicely-styled, and her makeup perfect, but thistime she seemed shaken, was plain-faced without even mascara, and pulledMikovits aside.12 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_537]Distraught, Annette told Mikovits that she had been at the house when an armoredtruck pulled up and she was forced by a menacing thug to empty their safe offifty thousand dollars and expensive jewelry.Harvey paced the halls near the café, talking on two cell-phones, as iffrantically trying to solve a serious problem. The story seemed suspicious toMikovits and made her wonder if something more sinister was happening. When theWhittemores filed their sixty-six million dollar countersuit against the Seenoson February 1, 2012, Mikovits read an account of this event:On one occasion, a large, very ominous and burly man named “Ray” demanded thatMr. Whittemore open a safe in the house. They assured Mr. Whittemore that theyonly wanted to see what was in it and that they would take nothing from thesafe. Mr. Whittemore got the combination from Mrs. Whittemore, as it was hersafe, and opened it for inspection.The large, burly man then dumped everything in the safe into a bag and took itwith him. Taken from the safe was a portion of Mrs. Whittemore’s jewelry andcash, leaving behind only Mrs. Whittemore’s passport. They also took Mr.Whittemore’s watches and jewelry. The Seenos demanded, and the Whittemorestransferred, most all of their family automobiles and most other assets thatthey had to the Seenos, except for certain retirement accounts and insurancepolicies.13 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_538]Mikovits recalled another peculiar incident with Harvey.14[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_539] Her condominium at the River Walk hadsuffered mold damage and at the Whittemore’s urging she had moved to a condothey owned at the Palladio.As the situation with the Seenos deteriorated the Whittemores had moved out oftheir houses at Lake Shore and Boulder Glen, eventually settling in anothercondominium at the Palladio, a few floors above Mikovits. They had becomeneighbors.In September 2011, the month in which she would later be fired, Judy saw Harveypull up in a ten-year-old SUV and park on the street in front of the Palladio.Mikovits was dressed in her workout clothes returning from the YMCA across thestreet as Harvey stood next to the vehicle, glancing from right to left in aseemingly paranoid way to see if anyone was watching. The SUV was filled withWhittemore possessions as they were apparently finishing up their move into thePalladio. Mikovits approached him and said, pleasantly, “Hi, Harvey!”She startled him, but when he saw her he seemed to instinctively relax, as if hehad been expecting someone or something else.Mikovits knew about some vague financial hot water, as Annette had at one pointmuttered something about how they had to “give everything back,” Harvey seemedhumbled right then, even deflated. “They took our cars,” he said, inhaling thecrisp, pre-autumn air. “They took our cars because we’re bankrupt.”Mikovits could only imagine how difficult the confession was for Harvey, whovalued his ability to make a showman’s entrance and impress everybody. Harvey’seyes darted up and down the street, as if he hoped nobody else would discoverhis secret shame.“Well, at least you have something to drive,” said Mikovits brightly. “You don’tneed stuff.” Mikovits had not known what to say as the world of the uber-richbaffled her. Were the Whittemores actually destitute? If so, how could the WPIstill function? What about their properties? Surely their vast fortune couldn’tjust evaporate? But of course it didn’t—she never saw the old SUV again and,their Cadillac SUV and Range Rover quietly reappeared.This just convinced Mikovits that they were on their way to solving theirproblems, and Harvey’s woes had only been a minor blip.* * *As described by the Whittemore lawsuit, the anger of the Seeno family explodedinto volcanic rage:Albert Seeno, Jr. threatened to go to the FBI with information that he allegedhe had regarding these alleged improprieties; that he would personally bringdown every member of the political “machine” in Nevada including references toUS Senators; that in the course of this threat asked whether Mr. Whittemorebelieved in God; whether Mr. Whittemore went to church; that Mr. Whittemoreshould gather his flock on Sunday and pray.Albert Seeno, Jr. threatened that when he was through with Mr. Whittemore hewould be disbarred and behind bars; that they would spend Mr. Whittemore intothe ground and there was no way he had the finances to defend himself; that hewould bring down any business or friend associated with Mr. Whittemore; and thatat Mr. Whittemore’s funeral there would not be one person in attendance.15[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_540]Mikovits could not help but notice that the actions supposedly taken by theSeenos mimicked those Harvey and Annette had done to her.She couldn’t help but wonder if her September 2011 public disavowal of the XMRVtest, which had potentially been worth millions, had thrown the Whittemores intoa panic. It might have been the only significant asset they had to appease theSeenos, since the real estate market was in such trouble because of therecession.All of these allegations by the Whittemores painted a significantly differentpicture than the one soon presented in the pages of the Reno Gazette Journallater that month. Recounting the history of the Seeno family business, thearticle of February 25, 2011, reported how the grandfather of Albert Seeno, Jr.,Gaetano Seeno had helped rebuild San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake and hadstarted Seeno Homes in 1938, and how a friendship with Reno businessman BillPaganetti led them to open the Peppermill Hotel Casino in the late 1970s. Of theSeenos, Paganetti said:Paganetti called Whittemore’s allegations “beyond fiction.” He said he had beenin business with the Seenos for 33 years and has never had an argument or crossword with either brother. “These people are the salt of the Earth. These peopleare good businessmen. I could live 100 lifetimes and not have anotherpartnership like this.”16 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_541]While the Seeno image was fluffed a bit in the article, it still pretty muchmatched their track record. In the course of running various business entitieswith a value estimated at more than four billion dollars, the list of allegedviolations by the Seenos comprised less than a handful.In the Reno Gazzette Journal, Albert Seeno Jr. pointed out that as a casinoowner he was continually under scrutiny of state regulators and that Nevadagaming laws required he avoid all activities which discredit the state:Gaming officials have access to and can take control of all records, includingphone and travel at any time, he said. Seeno said he has complied and cooperatedwith all regulators and regulations. “I’m not aware of any disciplinary actionsinvolving the Seenos,” said Mark Lipparelli, chairman of the Gaming ControlBoard.17 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_542]The Seenos’. picture of Harvey Whittemore was, on the other hand, consistentwith what Mikovits had observed since her discovery of the problems with theLombardi and XMRV serology in the blood working group in the months before shewas fired.The Seeno lawsuit painted Harvey Whittemore as a devious, manipulativeman-of-cutthroat-ambition who would stop at little to keep his position. Hisconnections also meant he could pull some pretty large strings to defend hishigh status, even when his connections didn’t know they were being played.* * *Mikovits believed that the Whittemores had set things up so she would be in aone-down position. The joining of the criminal and civil cases created asituation in which she could not defend against either case.Invoking her Fifth Amendment rights in the civil case was a strategy proposed byher lawyer, Scott Freeman, as a result of the two cases being so closelyintertwined. Even if the judge eventually found that she could not invoke herFifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, it was beyond belief that hehad summarily taken away her right to a jury trial and entered a defaultjudgment, something Judge Adams had never done in twenty-two years on the bench.A common cliché about the legal system is that the wheels of justice movedslowly, but in her case it seemed like a runaway train. Less than six weeks hadpassed between the filing of the civil suit on November 7, 2011, to the December19 hearing where Judge Adams had entered a default judgment against her.In retrospect, Mikovits believed the December 19, 2011, hearing before JudgeAdams was probably the high-water mark of the Whittemore’s campaign against her.The lawsuit by the Seenos suggested a pattern of dishonest dealings by theWhittemores, and more fallout seemed to be on the way.Mikovits could never have imagined that the next act in this drama would involvethe most powerful man in Congress, the majority leader of the United StatesSenate, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada.* * *On February 8, 2012, roughly two dozen FBI agents served subpoenas on businessassociates and friends of the Whittemores in about thirty locations in southernand northern Nevada.18 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_543] The Las Vegas ReviewJournal ran a story a few days later about the chain of events leading up to theFBI action.Contributions made on one date—March 31, 2007—to the re-election campaign ofSen. Harry Reid, the Democratic majority leader, have attracted the interest ofFBI agents, sources said.On that day, Reid’s campaign received $115,000 from about two dozen Whittemoreemployees and their family members, most of whom each contributed the maximumallowed $4,600, according to federal campaign reports.19[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_544]As the Las Vegas Review Journal noted in an article published on February 20,2012, regarding the gathering storm that centered on Harvey:“The big splash FBI agents made February 8 when they simultaneously servedsubpoenas across the state in their campaign contribution investigation of powerbroker Harvey Whittemore was designed to interview witnesses before they had achance to get their stories straight.”20 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_545]When Mikovits first read about the FBI actions she recoiled in horror. Sherealized she had inadvertently been part of such a conduit scheme designed tofunnel money to Harry Reid. Only it had not been in 2007 when Harry Reid wasraising money for other candidates, but in February of 2010 when Reid himselfwas up for re-election and facing a formidable challenger.21[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_546]A Harry Reid fundraising event took place at the Whittemore home.It was a keystone soiree since it was slated to be Harry Reid’s last electionand he faced stiff competition from his Republican opponent, Sharron Angle, whohad Republican Party support and was also a Tea Party favorite. Like allWhittemore events, this one was catered to the hilt.After getting a drink, Mikovits mingled and greeted Harry Reid, wishing him wellin the re-election. Harvey came up a few minutes later and said he needed totalk to Mikovits. In the front of the house, Harvey and Annette shared anoffice, with two grand mahogany desks facing each other holding computers.Harvey gathered a few other people together along with Mikovits and shepherdedthem into his office, one at a time, where Annette joined them.Harvey rhapsodized about the importance of the WPI, emphasizing how it wouldn’texist without Harry Reid’s help, and impressing the point that everyone shouldcontribute to his re-election. There was no doubt, he said, that Reid’sRepublican opponent would feel very differently about the WPI. Mikovits said shewould be happy to contribute, but did not have that kind of money. She noted shehadn’t been paid her bonus in a couple of years. If she got her bonus, she couldprobably make the maximum donation of $9,400 with her husband but Davidcomplained. They needed the money for their own families but Harvey made itclear, if Reid was not re-elected she would have no job.She thought it had all been legal. But it was not.The Las Vegas Review Journal article captured the attributes of Harvey and thecase:In 2007, Whittemore, who considered US Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., among hisclosest friends, was orchestrating the development of Coyote Springs, amaster-planned community in southern Nevada. With the help of Reid and othermembers of Nevada’s congressional delegation, Whittemore sought to overcomeseveral governmental hurdles because of county water issues and federal landissues.22 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_547]To Mikovits, it seemed as if the FBI believed it had assembled most of thepuzzle. She wished they could see the even-greater picture, including what hadhappened at the WPI.The Seeno case and the FBI investigation were not isolated events to Mikovitsbut seemed typical of how Harvey Whittemore behaved when squeezed in a corner.The scale of what Harvey had attempted was breathtaking.But there it all was in black and white in the pages of the Las Vegas Review.The article noted that the contributions made on March 31, 2007, to the Reidcampaign had attracted the attention of FBI agents.On that day, the Senate majority leader’s campaign received at least $133,400from 29 Whittemore associates, including his family members and his employeesand their spouses, most of whom contributed the maximum allowed $4,600,according to federal campaign reports.23 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_548]The article reported that the number had gone up since the initial reports, andthere were those who saw this as one of the largest campaign contribution casesin recent history.Gross, former head of enforcement for the Federal Elections Commission inWashington, said he had never seen that amount of money bundled all at once in afederal race. “I can’t recall another situation where that much came in on a(single) day,” he said.24 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_549]Mikovits told Freeman and Riggs she wanted to go the FBI and tell themeverything she knew about Harvey’s dealings.Her criminal attorneys told her she was crazy to consider this as she was stillunder indictment, released to their recognizance, and if she insisted on goingforward she could find another attorney. Their opinion was that if the FBIdidn’t come looking for her, she shouldn’t go looking for them. Mikovits feltmuch differently. She felt a moral obligation to tell the truth, regardless ofthe cost.It wasn’t until a few months later when she talked to her bankruptcy attorneyDavid Follin, whom she then learned was also an experienced criminal attorney,that she realized she had a legal professional willing to back her and she couldwager the risk of her speaking to the FBI.In late July of 2012, Follin arranged a conversation for her with the FBI. TheFBI had a program with the unofficial title “Queen for a Day.” A potentialwitness could come in and talk about a pending investigation and the FBIpromised it would not use any of the information gathered in the meeting againstthe informant. Mikovits had to pay her attorney more than a thousand dollars forthe three hours the FBI agent spent in the attorney’s office talking to theinformant. She detailed everything to the FBI agent, who in turn, expressedconcern that her testimony might be too complicated.“What’s complicated?” she responded, incredulously. “He did the same thing in2010 that he did in 2007.” In November of 2012 she received word that the FBIdid not believe it would need her testimony, although that might change. She hadwanted the opportunity to stand up in a court of law and tell the truth aboutHarvey, but there was nothing else she could do.She may have made a mistake by giving money to Reid in 2010 at Harvey’s urging,but she wasn’t the only one, and she had come clean about it to the authorities.* * *Just when it seemed that things couldn’t get any stranger, they did.In March of 2012, while talking with Jones in the midst of an unrelated hearing,Judge Adams disclosed he had received a total of $10,400 in campaigncontributions from Harvey Whittemore, his family, and his company.25[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_550] This was the same judge who had issued thedefault judgment against Mikovits in the civil case, for which the WPI waslooking for damages from Mikovits of fifteen million dollars.If the civil action against Mikovits had taken place in California whereMikovits was living with her husband, the judge would have had to consult theCalifornia Code of Judicial Ethics, which runs fifty-three pages.26[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_551]By comparison, the Nevada Code of Judicial Conduct is six pages long.27[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_552]The rule in California is that a judge must disclose to the other side anycontribution made to his campaign of more than $100 by a party or lawyer whoappears before him.28 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_553] California law alsoholds that a judge must disqualify himself if one of the parties before him hasgiven more than $1,500 to his campaign.29 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_554]Nevada has no rules on the amount of money a judge may receive before he isrequired to disclose that information to the other side, or disqualify himselffrom the case. While judges in Nevada are required to “avoid both improprietyand the appearance of impropriety,”30 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_555] thejudge himself makes a call about these ethical gray zones.In essence, the judge gets to judge his own behavior.If Judge Adams had been on the bench in California and had failed to reveal the$10,400 in contributions, he would have been subject to an investigation forviolation of both California law and the California Code of Judicial Ethics.Punishment could have ranged from a fine to being stripped of his judicialrobes.* * *With the Whittemores now under swarming legal and media scrutiny, Mikovitsnoticed that her own attorneys were treating her more favorably.31[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_556]It was suddenly as if they fully believed her and were listening with sharperears. She had been puzzled by the sometimes rote behavior of her lawyers. Sheknew she had been under stress (as anyone would be), in disbelief at theunfolding events, and on most occasions in their presence she had been angry anddistraught. But all of this seemed a reasonable reaction to something sooverwhelming and traumatizing.In fact, she thought she behaved a good deal like the cancer patients she dealtwith in support groups who were facing the very real possibility they might die.She had just never taken it personally when they became angry and upset. She hadalso never yelled at any of the patients. She felt her criminal attorneys seemedto yell at her quite frequently when they should have been levelheaded. On March7, 2012, a settlement offer was made by the Whittemore’s attorney, Ann Hall, andconveyed by email. The offer listed several things which had been discussedbefore: return of the notebooks, an apology from Mikovits, paying more than$450,000 in legal fees, the two sides would refrain from publicly criticizingeach other, and the WPI would tell the district attorney that they consideredthe matter closed.32 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_557]For Mikovits, this offer bent the facts and was as ludicrous as both the civiland the criminal cases, and she conveyed her feelings clearly to her attorneys.On March 8, 2012, she wrote back to her attorneys:All original notebooks are in custody. I did absolutely NOTHING wrong and willNOT apologize for being wrongfully terminated in an attempt to preventWhittemore crimes and will not pay a penny for their frivolous lawsuit.33[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_558]Her professional and financial life was at stake. An apology was an admissionshe had committed wrongdoing, and she strongly believed she had not done so. Ifshe gave a scripted, bogus apology she doubted she would ever work in scienceagain. More importantly, how could she face the patients if she sold them out toprotect herself?The truth was the truth.For his part, Dennis Neil Jones was trying to settle the matter in a way whichdid not devastate her financially, although he appreciated $450,00 was financialdevastation to someone who rarely had more than a few thousand dollars in anybank account. On March 9, 2012, he wrote to Mikovits:I understand how frustrating the civil and the criminal cases are for you, butplease don’t lash out at me. I’m trying to help you. I am not the judge. I donot make the legal rulings in the case . . . I am also obligated to provide myanalysis regarding any settlement offer, so that you can make an informeddecision. You say that you will never apologize and you will never pay WPIanything. I get that. I just want to make absolutely sure that you understandthe probable implications of your position. The judge doesn’t care about the newcivil case against the Whittemores. He doesn’t care whether politicians arerefunding the Whittemores’ political contributions. Those new developments willnot cause the judge to throw the case out of court.34[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_559]No wonder everybody was screaming at each other. It was like a medical andcriminal action thriller on the big screen, too unreal to comprehend.But with the news media reports about Harvey, at least one of her attorneysseemed to understand that he needed to broaden his grasp of what was happening.Her criminal attorney, Scott Freeman, told Mikovits she needed to fly to Renoand he would have a “Dr. Judy Mikovits Day.” She could talk to him as much asshe needed until she had nothing else left to say. He had copies of all thenotebooks and other documents in his office.So on March 12, 2012, Mikovits flew to Reno to spend the day with Scott Freemanand Tammy Riggs to prove her innocence.The first item they tackled was the notebooks, which Mikovits had not seen sinceshe had been fired on September 29, 2011. In their damages claim, theWhittemores were asking for the salary they had paid Mikovits for the previousfive years and the cost of the entire research program: including Peterson’ssalary, WPI parties and travel costs paid by patient organizations.Using her calendar and the copies of the notebooks, she had been able tocorrelate every day she was at the lab with the work she had written down in anotebook. The notebooks did not leave her lab/office ever, so whenever she hadtaken a trip she had recorded the information separately, then transcribed itwhen she returned.In Katy Hagen’s notebook, she was able to go to the page marked March 23, 2009,and find where Lombardi had directed Hagen to culture approximately thirtypatient samples together with the LNCaP cells producing XMRV in Mikovits’sresearch lab rather than the clinical lab, curiously while Mikovits had been outof town. As she explained to Freeman and Riggs was a direct violation of allsound scientific protocol and from what they had learned subsequently about theability of XMRV to spread through the air, it was a serious problem, and thereason Mikovits had been so methodical about dividing up the lab work to preventcontamination. The entire staff had been told this and Hagen had taped theinstructions in her notebook. Ruscetti and Mikovits were furious at this breachof their instructions.While Mikovits believed that Silverman’s VP-62 clone and 22RV1 prostate cancerline had never been in her labs, which meant that she had cultured an XMRV-likeretrovirus from at least one patient, it did raise the issue of contamination inthe research lab.Lombardi had denied that he had ever cultured an XMRV sample in the clinical labor research lab and Mikovits believed him until she found the entry in Hagen’snotebook on July 8th, 2011, as things started to deteriorate.Technically, he hadtold the truth. He had in fact directed the lab technician Katy Hagen to do theculture.When Mikovits had uncovered this fact and the next day disclosed it to Harveyand Annette Whittemore. Annette blamed it on Mikovits, saying in an email thatMikovits “should have known what her employees were doing.”35[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_560]A scientist needed to have absolute trust in the integrity of her collaboratorsor else the entire structure fell apart. On March 12, 2012, Mikovits noted thatthe only missing item from her desk drawers was the loose four pages Lombardihad copied from his notebook when she had confronted him over Silverman’sassertion that Lombardi had sent him samples in March 2009.However, Lombardi was never authorized to send samples to anyone.What the hell was going on?She had demanded he document to her what he had been doing since he had beentransferred to the clinical lab after the debacle at the Cleveland Clinic inNovember 2009, a time period of almost two years. So then he had produced forher just four xeroxed pages documenting that he had indeed done no work on theNIH grants while still requesting salary support. She had put those pages inHagen’s notebook marking the page and told both Carli West Kinne and Harvey andAnnette Whittemore that he was not to be paid for FY 2010–2011.Now they were missing from the materials in Freeman’s office.Another issue that had confounded the attorneys, vital to the criminal case, wasthe alleged contract she had signed on February 22, 2009, with the WPI in whichshe allegedly promised that all copies of her data and intellectual propertywere the sole property of the WPI and would be returned upon her termination.The only glitch was she had never signed the document, nor even seen it, until amonth after she was fired when it was mailed to her home.Mikovits explained to Freeman why she believed it was a forgery. For one thing,she had started three years earlier, on November 15, 2006, and this wascertainly not the email contract agreement she had worked under since that date.Even more bizarre, the date on the document had been changed to October 2008, inhandwriting that was not Mikovits’s.She had signed the collaboration agreement with the National Cancer Instituteand the Cleveland Clinic on January 22, 2009. That document made it clear thatany intellectual property generated by the collaboration was owned equally bythe three institutions. She would not then have signed a second contract thenext month contradicting the January one.The pagination on the signature page was also different than the rest of thecontract and the font was different. Mikovits wondered if it had been taken froman unrelated document she had signed on February 22, 2009, that was not thecut-and-pasted “contract” they now had. But the signature of the new dateclearly did not belong to her. She made her Os and Ts in a very distinctivemanner that was apparently, by the forger, inimitable.Freeman listened carefully and looked at examples of her signatures and date,along with the signature and new date on the so-called “contract” page. Freemandid so with a magnifying glass and then asked Tammy Riggs to come over and peercloser. They concurred it did not look like her handwriting.Mikovits felt they must have added in the October 2008 date when they realizedthe February 2009 date was after they had generated preliminary data on XMRV andthe inflammatory cytokine signature. In fact, all of the intellectual propertybelonging to Mikovits had been generated before February 2009. When Scott andTammy had magnified the seeming forgery and saw it with their own eyes, Mikovitscould almost feel the climate shift.Mikovits went on to show she could account for every notebook entry and everydate when she was not in the lab for the entire five and a half years!Clearly, there were no missing notebooks!At the end of the day, Scott Freeman was beaming. “How come you never lie?” heasked her. Mikovits couldn’t get over the question. Scientists were supposed totell the truth, just as was supposed to happen in the legal system.Why was actual honesty such a rare thing?* * *The following day, March 13, 2012, Scott Freeman and Tammy Riggs met with Harveyand Annette Whittemore, Lombardi, and their attorney, Ann Hall. Mikovits was notthere, but when her attorneys called later that day they sounded elated.36[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_561]They had reviewed the notebooks to show that Mikovits had worked diligently forfive years and everything was recorded and present, so the Whittemore team’sclaim that she owed them her salary for that time or that original notebooks bereturned was baseless. They also showed that every notebook was accounted for.They directly pointed out the page on which Lombardi directed Katy Hagen toculture XMRV in Mikovits’s research lab.Freeman and Riggs went on to say how they were able to discuss how Lombardi hadnot been entitled to the cell line, which they had used to justify firingMikovits and said they felt comfortable they could prove that in a court of law.Then they discussed the supposed contract and the difficulties they thought theWhittemores would have in proving that Mikovits had actually signed it.They described Annette Whittemore and Lombardi as “white as ghosts,” and Hallstill attempting to maintain there were missing notebooks.About two weeks later Mikovits got a courtesy call from Scott Freeman. He wantedto tell her personally that he had been appointed to the bench and would now bea judge. He would commence that position immediately so could not continuerepresenting her, but his partner would do so.* * *Two days later, on March 14, 2012, Mikovits was in San Francisco meeting with abio-tech company when her civil attorney, Dennis Jones, and her husband, David,called.37 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_562] Jones had been meeting with theWhittemores to discuss the damages in the civil suit.Jones said there was a new offer on the table and suggested she take it.If Mikovits signed a letter of apology, the civil suit would be settled and theywouldn’t even ask for legal fees. The criminal charges would be droppedimmediately. Her signature on a letter of apology and promise never to speak ofthese events again would end everything. David, battle-weary and wanting to moveforward, suggested she sign it as well.Mikovits wasn’t tempted. She explained to her husband and her lawyer that theydid not understand that to sign an apology that was a lie and never discuss thecrimes committed against her and the patients would end everything. It wouldeffectively end her life.Dennis Jones objected, but Mikovits remained firm.The offer was withdrawn.* * *The Seeno family lawsuit against the Whittemores, as well as the Whittemorecounter-suit would eventually be settled in February of 2013, but the truth orfalsity of the accusations in both cases would remain hidden from view.At that time, James Pisanelli, the Seeno family’s Las Vegas lawyer, released astatement which read: “The parties have reached a comprehensive settlement ofall pending litigation. The financial terms of the settlement are confidentialand the Seeno/WNG parties offer no comment as to the litigation or any aspect ofthe agreement at this time, except that all litigation by and between theparties will be dismissed.”38 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_563]The outcome was disappointing to Mikovits. She’d wanted the facts to be revealedto all in a court of law, not silenced forever, as they attempted to extort herinto silence.* * *Jones continued to press her case.On April 25, 2012, he filed a motion for the new judge to set aside the defaultjudgment. The motion was everything Mikovits could have asked for, althoughJones was not optimistic about its chances.The new judge, Janet Berry, who would rule on the motion still had to work withJudge Adams, and Jones felt no judge would rule against another sitting judge.Still, it felt good to see her side of the story presented in the motion:Judge Adams recently confirmed the existence of bias, because:1) he accepted substantial campaign contributions from HarveyWhittemore—co-founder of the Whittemore Peterson Institute and President of itsseveral affiliated companies, from Whittemore’s family members and from acompany with which Whittemore is or was closely affiliated,2) Mr. Whittemore is the target of an FBI probe and a Grand Jury Investigationinto illegal campaign contributions,3) The criminal investigation of Mr. Whittemore, as well as a fraud suit filedrecently by Thomas and Albert Seeno, alleging that Mr. Whittemore converted andimproperly disbursed funds from the same corporation that contributed $5,000 toJudge Adams’s re-election campaign, has garnered intense media scrutiny,4) two Congressmen recently called upon everyone who accepted campaigncontributions from Mr. Whittemore, including Judge Adams, to donate thosecontributions to charity; and5) Judge Adams is unable to donate the money he received from Mr. Whittemore andhis affiliates to charity.None of the foregoing facts were disclosed to Mikovits or her counsel until theday before Judge Adams recused himself (March 16, 2012), even though Judge Adamsknew about the tainted donations the very first day the case was assigned tohim.Judge Adams also admitted to imposing against Dr. Mikovits the most severesanction he has ever imposed in a civil case—the striking of her answer—becauseshe attempted to assert her constitutionally protected right againstself-incrimination in response to a preliminary injunction issued by JudgeAdams. Significantly, at the time of the hearing on Plaintiff’s motion forpreliminary injunction, Dr. Mikovits was in custody in California, on a bailimposed by the Washoe County District Attorney, presumably at Mr. Whittemore’srequest.39 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_564]Mikovits was pleased with how her attorney had set up the facts, but also how itimpacted the fundamental justice of her case. Jones went through the enormouspolitical influence of Harvey Whittemore and the allegation he’d orchestratedMikovits’s criminal arrest, just as she was trying to respond to the preliminaryinjunction in the civil case.Then, Judge Adams struck Dr. Mikovits’s answer, denied her motion to stay thisaction pending resolution of the criminal case and denied all other requestedrelief—thereby handing Plaintiff a win by default.This case and the companion criminal case stink of undue influence and bias.Judge Adams’ belated recusal does not restore the scales of justice to an equalbalance, because he has already irreparably damaged her case by ordering heranswer stricken, entering her default, granting a permanent injunction andordering that she cannot take any discovery or even introduce evidence at thedamages hearing.40 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_565]Jones also argued that bringing in a new judge just to hear damages did notrestore the parties to an even playing field.The civil case should be restarted from the beginning.The motion had presented all the arguments Mikovits wanted the court to hear,but also what her supporters in the patient and scientific communities needed tosee exposed. Jones pulled no punches in laying out exactly what he viewed as thefacts. Mikovits was a nationally renowned scientist and a Principal Investigatoron several government grants for which she held the ultimate authority forfunds, materials, and protocols. Jones continued:Dr. Mikovits relationship with WPI deteriorated after she discovered a series ofimproper, unethical and possibly illegal acts by the Whittemores and VincentLombardi, the lab director at VIP Dx. These acts included, but were not limitedto,1) the Whittemores arranging to pay one half of Dr. Lombardi’s salary out of WPIfunds obtained via federal grants, even though Dr. Lombardi did no work at WPIbut was instead employed full time at VIP Dx;2) ordering a research assistant to misuse cells allocated for non-profitresearch to harvest supplies for the for-profit VIP Dx clinic, and then coveringup the misappropriation for two years;3) selling blood tests through VIP Dx, even after those tests had beeninvalidated as unreliable, thereby committing Medicare fraud; and4) failing to validate serological assays.41[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_566]As Jones had predicted, the new judge was unwilling to go against anothersitting member of the bench. The motion was denied. Judge Berry, set the date ofthe damages hearing for September 6, 2012.That hearing would never be held.* * *While the Whittemores were prevailing in the civil case against Mikovits, theywere not faring so well with the FBI and the Grand Jury.On June 6, 2012, Harvey Whittemore was indicted on federal charges of electionviolations. An article in the Las Vegas Sun a few days later captured thecontradictions of this near-mythical figure.Harvey Whittemore once bounded through Nevada’s Legislature as the embodiment ofinfluence—a lobbyist for casinos and other powerful interests, a lawyer, agregarious personality and sharp mind. He was also a lucrative campaigncontributor for elected officials, which helped open doors.42[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_567]The article described Whittemore as somebody who pushed boundaries, like theinstallation of a private pier at his home on Lake Tahoe. Mikovits recalled themany times she’d stood on that very pier as Harvey pulled up in one of hisspeedboats, encouraging everybody to jump in and speed across the lake to arestaurant.And there were the darker aspects to his character, such as the tall glass wallsthat the Legislature had installed in the Senate and Assembly chambers to keepthose in the public gallery separated from the lawmakers. They quickly becameknown as “Harvey” walls because of Whittemore’s well-known penchant for reachinginto the chambers before votes on legislation.43[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_568]But all of that was of little importance, as Whittemore entered the courtroom“in a dark suit and shackles around his ankles” to offer his plea to the fourfederal charges against him for crimes againt the democratic process.44[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_569]The article described the courtroom hearing as surreal, as the room was filledwith reporters, friends, family, and lawyers. The reporter noted he couldn’t getmany people to go on the record to be quoted, but the connections between Harveyand the powerful in Nevada ran all the way to the judge, William Cobb, who’dknown Whittemore for close to forty years and admitted to having a closerelationship with Whittemore.45 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_570] The articlerecorded that Judge Cobb even admitted feeling a little bit ridiculous when heasked Whittemore to state his full name for the record.46[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_571]* * *When Mikovits’s criminal attorney Scott Freeman had phoned to let her know hecould no longer serve as her attorney on March 29, 2012, he had assured her thatthe criminal charges were on their way to being dismissed in the next week.But that did not happen. Each hearing scheduled in March, April, and May, waspostponed with no reason given.The waiting was agony for Mikovits, but her advisors and friends told her it wassimply a matter of time before things started turning in her favor.The district attorney for Washoe County filed for dismissal of the criminalcharges against Mikovits on June 11, 2012, only four days after Harvey wasindicted. Her supporters cheered this new direction, but Mikovits could not helpbut believe the charges had not been dropped sooner in order to prevent her frombringing evidence of another conduit scam against Whittemore. This scam woulddirectly involve and benefit the WPI.Jon Cohen, the writer for Science, even popped up with a quick email a few dayslater, asking for an update of her current work.47[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_572]Mikovits could not believe his casualness, as if she had just emerged from somequotidian debate. Was he completely oblivious about what had happened?She wrote him back and tried to keep any anger tempered, saying simply, “Thepublication by you and Science of my mug shot without my permission and with therefusal of the Ventura judge and my attorney has caused irreparable damage.48[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_573]Cohen responded by writing back, claiming that the mug shot brought sympathy andgoodwill her way, and if there was any damage caused to her reputation, it wasthe fault of the Whittemore Peterson Institute and the Washoe County DistrictAttorney’s office.49 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_574]Mikovits ripped into him in a subsequent email for what she considered to betheir tabloid-like sensationalism of her case:“Science promoted my defamation. That picture provided no sympathy only disgustand fear. Many of my colleagues found its publication so reprehensible as to vownever to read or submit to Science again. You may not have created the story butyou sensationalized it without merit or balance to the destruction of my 30+year career. Others lied to you or covered their mistakes. You chose to notreport the Silverman mistake, which was paramount as a mistake, but instead todestroy me when I was conveniently charged with a fictitious felony and couldnot defend myself. You should be ashamed of yourself. At least I have myintegrity.”50 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_575]Cohen continued on in his defense, writing back that he was proud of thecoverage by Science, and that there was never any attempt to harm herreputation. He said he was contacting her because of what he imagined was verygood news, the dropping of the criminal charges, which had always struck him asbizarre and extraordinary.51 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_576]Eventually, Mikovits relented and gave a short interview to Cohen.What else was she going to do? Retreat into silence? How would that help herrepair the damage? He then published a brief article in the Science Insider,hardly the type of thing to restore her reputation, but perhaps better thannothing. At least Cohen seemed to make an effort at remediating the harm. Thearticle was entitled, “Criminal Charges Dropped Against Chronic Fatigue SyndromeResearcher Judy Mikovits.”Cohen’s article noted that the charges had been dismissed without prejudice,which meant that a complaint could still be filed in the future, then noted thebizarre twists in the case. The judge in the civil case who ruled against her,removed himself from the case when it was revealed he’d received significantcampaign contributions from Harvey Whittemore, who was himself now charged withmaking illegal campaign contributions. Cohen continued.“Assistant District Attorney John Helzer, who filed the dismissal, saysWhittemore’s legal troubles factored into his decision. “There’s a lot going onwith the federal government and different levels that wasn’t occurring when wefirst became involved with prosecuting this case,” says Helzer. “And we havewitness issues that have arisen.”52 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_577]The witness issues that had arisen, were of course related to Max Pfost,Mikovits’s former research associate, who had disavowed his earlier affidavit.* * *“Let me give you some advice,” her criminal attorney, Tammy Riggs, toldMikovits, minutes after informing her the criminal charges were dismissed.53[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_578] “I want you to understand what it meanswhen the district attorney dismisses charges against you ‘without prejudice.’ Itmeans he can come back at any time within the statute of limitations and saythey have new evidence and refile the charges. I also want to explain slander. ”“But that’s ridiculous,” Mikovits had interrupted. “They don’t have any evidenceand it’s not slander if it’s the truth. I have emails and witnesses to back upevery word I have ever said.”“I don’t know where Harvey is getting the money but he has it and he will buryyou the next time. Go live your life, because you are lucky you are not in jailin Nevada as you would never get out,” Riggs said.“What life do I have? Since I was twelve years old, I have dedicated my life tothe chronically ill. I am a research scientist!” But, Mikovits had a sinkingfeeling that Riggs was right. The idea that she had eluded Harvey’s clutches butstill was not out of danger, was shared by her civil attorney, Dennis NeilJones.Mikovits was ready to make the damages hearing scheduled on September 6,2012—the civil trial she had been denied. She compiled a list of ninety-sevenwitnesses, patients, and scientists, including Ian Lipkin, Frank Ruscetti, andeven John Coffin, who could testify that she had done her job and had not onlydone no damage to the WPI, but had been a benefit to the institute.“We’re not going,” Jones said.Mikovits became very agitated and excited, saying that this needed to be done.“Look at you!” said Jones. “You’re upset and you’re yelling.”“You’d yell, too! I have put up with this farce long enough! I’m going to defendmyself! I’m going to show the truth! I have hundreds of emails! I have all ofthese witnesses and they will come and I will pay for it!”“You don’t have the money,” Jones said.Mikovits replied, “I’ll sell my houses. They’re coming and I will—”Jones swiftly cut her off. “You’re being irrational. Do you think that if you gointo that courtroom and you tell the truth, and you’re calm and collected, youexpose the fraud, you expose Harvey and Annette Whittemore, and all thereporters are there—do you honestly think you will walk out of that courthouse?Do you think that the DA won’t be standing there with handcuffs and leg shacklesto take you back to jail for new evidence that he just discovered?”“That’s ridiculous. There’s no new evidence!” replied Mikovits.In a cold, but not unfriendly voice he said, “They didn’t have any the firsttime, did they?”She got that nauseated feeling again. She knew that if she was arrested again,this time in Reno, that they would not have the money to pay a bail bondsman andshe might be locked up for a very long time. The previous time she had been injail it had nearly destroyed David. What would another false imprisonment do toher husband? For several weeks Jones had been trying to convince her to filebankruptcy. “You want me to file the bankruptcy, don’t you?” she asked him.He started going over the points he had already made to her several times.“Taking a chapter seven bankruptcy stays everything. There’s no liability to thedefault judgment against you. You’ll be able to get a job. It freezeseverything. There is nothing in the courts. There’s nothing that says you didanything. You can go on with your life.”It seemed like a lawyer’s trick, but there was no other viable option. She hadkept herself from being convicted as a criminal, but even if uncuffed, her handswere still tied.But she was not free, either, not with the threat of fifteen million dollars indamages being assessed against her by a biased judicial system. Taking thebankruptcy was the only way to stop the madness.But it was still not the justice she wanted.It was not even close.The plain truth was she could not go back to her life. She was a researchscientist and she had been unjustly disenfranchised. Nobody would touch her. Nowlike the patients, she had to face the fact that she could never again do thosethings she loved the most.* * *On May 29, 2013, following a two-week jury trial, Harvey Whittemore wasconvicted on one count of making excessive campaign contributions, one count ofmaking contributions in the name of others, and one count of causing amaterially false statement to be made to the Federal Elections Commission.54[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_579]In a press release issued by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Acting USAssistant Attorney General Mythili Raman said, “Today, a jury convicted Mr.Whittemore of using dozens of straw donors to evade contribution limits so hecould make good on a campaign fundraising promise. The cornerstone of ourcampaign finance laws is contribution limits and transparency, and Mr.Whittemore’s crime was designed to undermine both. Today’s verdict demonstratesour resolve to aggressively pursue those who use illegal tricks to corrupt ourdemocratic process.”55 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_580]The conviction had the potential to send Harvey Whittemore to jail for fiveyears and pay a $250,000 fine on each of the three felonies of which he wasconvicted.* * *The government’s sentencing memorandum summarized the case against HarveyWhittemore and the three charges of which he had been convicted.“After promising Senator Harry Reid, a candidate for reelection to the USSenate, in February 2007 that he would raise a total of $150,000 in campaigncontributions, Whittemore sought to make good on his promise by using employeesof his real estate development company, his family members, and many of theirspouses as “straw” or “conduit donors . . . On a single day, he caused one ofhis employees to transmit $138,000 in contributions, the vast majority of whichhe had unlawfully funded.”56 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_581] The governmentasked for Whittemore to be sentenced to four years and three months in prison,three years of supervised release, and a fine of $133,400, the amount ofWhittemore’s illegal campaign contributions.The sentencing hearing was held on September 30, 2013, before District CourtJudge Larry Hicks, starting at 1:33 p.m. and not ending until nearly six hourslater at 7:14 p.m., an uncommonly long time for such a hearing.To say it was a hard-fought hearing on both sides would be an understatement.Whittemore’s attorney, Dominic Gentile discussed Whittemore’s well-documentedcharitable activities and good character as grounds for a reduction insentence.57 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_582]Eventually, Harvey Whittemore took the stand to accept responsibility for whathe had done, but also to offer an explanation. “I didn’t do this for greed. Ididn’t do this for power. I didn’t do it for any other reason other than afriend asked me to raise money. I didn’t want anything. I didn’t need anything.I didn’t need to be ingratiated. I didn’t need a pat on the head. A person askedme to help him. I did it in a way that was wrong. I humbly ask that you lookupon this life’s work and my conduct and find that it is worthy of a variancebelow the guidelines.”58 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_583]This drew a swift rebuke from Assistant United States Attorney Steve Myhre whosaid, “This is a very serious offense. And we’ve heard sort of an almostschizophrenic argument from the defense: On the one hand, it’s serious, but, oh,really not that serious: I accept responsibility but not really. Mr. Whittemoresaid that he believed his conduct was lawful, that he was naïve and perhapsarrogant to believe that his conduct was lawful, but, oh, my goodness, I gavemyself bad advice, and I accept that the jury found me guilty . . . it’s a farcry from any expression of remorse . . . He’s guilty of knowfully and willfullyviolating the law. And the law he violated strikes at the very heart of ourelection process, the very cornerstone of our government.”59[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_584]Myhre went onto note that at one point during the trial, Harvey Whittemore’sattorney represented that Whittemore was worth $300 million dollars60[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_585], but then proceeded to what he consideredto be the heart of the matter. “This was about a campaign contribution. Threeyears before the election. A campaign contribution pledge that he made at thevery time that he’s sitting on 30,000 acres in southern Nevada that will foreverseal his fortune, seal his wealth . . . And that pledge, that campaign pledge,he went to the extent of committing a felony offense so that he could maintainhis status, his level of influence, his level of accessibility to thesenator.”61 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_586]Judge Hicks had a few things to say about Harvey Whittemore and the case. “Now,before me I have this man, Harvey Whittemore, who I have personally known overthe years and known the family, or known of the family, not close personalfriends, but at least to the level of people you say hello to when you pass inthe hallway and you appreciate seeing them . . . I have a man here who he andhis wife have, I mean, in the way they’ve treated their family, the way they’vetreated their friends, are reflected in the letters that have been received bythe court . . . And I can tell you that those letters are absolutely incredible.This man is a fine family man. This man has done great things in this community.And these are not things that are to be treated lightly.”62[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_587]During trial the issue of Harvey Whittemore’s character had come up, and theletters he had received. Assistant United States Attorney, Steve Myhre comparedthe Whittemore saga to the Wizard of Oz. Myhre argued before the court. “And yourecall in that story how Dorothy and her three imaginary friends are confrontedwith a big screen of this larger-than-life person, and there’s all sorts ofsmoke and mirror and loud noises and booming voices and these images that justscare the daylights out of those people.“But it’s not until Dorothy’s little dog Toto runs over and pulls a curtain backthat you see that behind all the loud noises and the smoke and the mirrors andthe lights is someone manipulating some controls, manipulating the scene, if youwill.“And you recall the classic response that the wizard manipulating the scene,what he says when the curtain’s pulled back. He says, ‘Ignore the man behind thecurtain.’”63 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_588]Myhre then linked the Wizard of Oz narrative to those who had written letters onHarvey’s behalf. “Those witnesses have not seen or heard the testimony that cameout of the witness stand from all of the people who have testified in this case.Those witnesses have not seen all the documents that you have and that you willsee during your deliberations. They see one thing. They see the façade on thewall with the smoke and the mirrors. They don’t see the man behind the curtainwith the levers funneling money into the Reid campaign. They don’t see that.You, however, have that benefit.”64 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_589]There was a good deal more discussion, then Judge Hicks moved towards aconclusion of the sentencing hearing. While it seemed that Judge Hicks had hearda great deal of the government’s argument, it did not fully convince him. “Youtake this serious of a law that goes to our campaign financial disclosures andour reliability and how much faith we can place in our electoral process and inour democracy itself, and take examples of all of these conduit contributions,in one day family, friends, business associates, every one of those is a felonyoffense . . . the evidence shows black and white where the money came from, Mr.Whittemore’s personal account; who it went to, his employees, his relatives, andtheir spouses, all for the purpose of making a phony contribution to HarryReid’s campaign. The evidence was unassailable . . . No one is above the law.And there simply must be just punishment for criminal conduct involvingintentional felony offenses such as these, which many would argue that the courtshould not depart from the sentencing guidelines that are the beginning pointfor the court to consider sentence in this case. However, I’m doing that.”65[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_590] (bold and italics added.)Instead of the fifty-one months in jail the U.S Attorney’s office had argued forin the sentencing memorandum, Judge Hicks sentenced Harvey Whittemore totwenty-four months in jail, imposed a hundred thousand dollar fine, two years ofsupervised release, and a hundred hours of community service.After exhausting various appeals, on June 5, 2014, Harvey Whittemore was orderedto surrender to federal prison authorities on August 6, 2014, to begin servinghis two-year prison sentence.66 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach18fn_591]It had taken the federal authorities a little over two and a half years fromtheir raid on Harvey Whittemore and his family and business associates toprosecute him, handle the various appeals, and for Harvey to spend his first dayin jail.By contrast, it only took six weeks for Judy Mikovits to go from having a civilcase filed against her to having a judge who took significant campaigncontributions from the Whittemore family and other associates to impose adefault judgment on her, all without her having a single day in court to presenther case. (And during those six weeks, she had spent five days in jail with nowarrant or probable cause of any crime being committed by Mikovits.) As much asshe might have wanted to, it was difficult for Mikovits to believe that anythingclose to justice had been done."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINETEENThe Silverman MistakeJohn Coffin, had his own theory; XMRV had been accidentally created in a lab atCase Western University in Cleveland between 1993 and 1996. Coffin described howlab workers there had transplanted human prostate tumor cells into animmune-deficient lab mouse, a common procedure for procuring a colony of cells,or a human cell line for further study.1 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach19fn_592]—Hillary Johnson, “Hunting the Shadow Virus,”Discover, March 2013When Joe DeRisi created his Virochip in 2003 and claimed it could identify everyknown virus, the scientific community hailed it as a major breakthrough in viraldetection, eventually awarding DeRisi the $250,000 Heinz Award for technologicalinnovation in 2008.2 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach19fn_593] Scientific advancedepends on the development of new technology. However, the tools often fallshort of being able to evaluate complex natural or biological phenomena.DeRisi’s Virochip contained 72 base pairs of DNA from every known virus. Theaverage replication-competent retrovirus contains approximately 8,000 base pairsof DNA (DNA viruses like EBV and HHV-6 are much larger).Can a test, which contains less than 1 percent of the DNA of a virus accuratelyidentify a virus?The answer is—it depends.All scientists are taught that any procedure is only as good as the quality ofmaterials used. This is why it was so stunning to learn in 2012 the prostatetissue Silverman used in the original study did not contain XMRV sequences, butthat the RNA made from this tissue did contain XMRV sequences.3[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach19fn_594] Six years later, they report an obvioussource of contamination.Had they used appropriate controls, they likely would have detected their sourceof contamination in the beginning.* * *While it’s true that some viruses evolve and mutate quickly, it’s also true thatmany regions of their DNA do not. When a “conserved” region of DNA is discoveredit provides scientists with an effective means of identifying the virus.However, this approach is fraught with the potential for error. Theidentification of a “conserved” region of DNA, one that does not change overmillennia, could indicate the existence of a broader family of viruses.What about changes in the remaining DNA of the initial virus?When Bob Silverman and Joe DeRisi put the prostate cancer tissue samples on theVirochip micro-array, it lit up with what looked suspiciously like a mouseleukemia virus (MLV).4 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach19fn_595] There were a fewbase pairs of difference but that was to be expected since the virus was foundin human tissue. Since it was not exactly a mouse leukemia virus they named itmurine leukemia virus-related virus.And since it had been found in human tissue rather than mouse they named it“xenotropic” which means it was replicating in the cells of another species,namely human beings.That is how the virus came to be called XMRV, or xenotropic murine leukemiavirus-related virus. All they had at this time was 72 base pairs out of anestimated 8,000 in a typical virus. If they wanted to make real progress, theyhad to get more genetic information about the virus, and the traditional way ofgetting this information was to extract and isolate the virus from an actualhuman, the same way that human retroviruses HTLV-1 and HIV-1, and almost allanimal retroviruses had been discovered.By 2006, science had come a long way since Montagnier had isolated HIV, andsome, like Lipkin and DeRisi, believed the shortcuts developed by the explosionof molecular technology to the well-known methods of viral isolation were validand could be solely relied upon.Using a needle biopsy of three different prostate cancer tissue samples,Silverman and his collaborator at the Cleveland Clinic, Jaydip Das Gupta,extracted a sample from VP-62, one of the prostate cancer tissues. With the helpof enzymes available in the laboratory, they took the 72 base pairs identifiedby the Virochip, and just like one might see on a television pathology show,they used PCR (polymerase chain reaction) to amplify the genetic sample so thatenough existed for appropriate testing.They call it “genome walking,” and the idea is to literally extend the 72 knownbase pairs out into other regions of the genome. This technique may produceerrors because of “low specificity and efficiency, short walking distance, andcomplexity of the methodology.”5 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach19fn_596]But from this kind of clonal research all the way up to Dolly the Sheep,6[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach19fn_597] all scientific cloning is a work inprogress.Silverman and Das Gupta couldn’t get enough of the 8,000 base pairs to create anactual infectious molecular clone. Mikovits would not learn until 2011 that theywere not able to obtain enough genetic materials from the VP-62 sample to createa clone. They would then go to other samples and start again. This yieldedadditional genetic sequences, but still not enough for their full-lengthmolecular clone.They sequenced additional material from another sample to get their finalsequences of the 8,000 base pairs in order to complete their infectiousmolecular clone. Then, with their sequences from three different patientsamples, they attempted to piece together the sequence of what XMRV might looklike in an actual human being.It was as if Silverman had created something of a “Frankenstein” virus fromthree different patients. What if there was significant variation between theviruses in these three patients? Or what if they had “stitched” the virustogether incorrectly into a hastily-made “crazy quilt”? They might not haveduplicated what existed in nature, but created something entirely unique.For Mikovits and those of her generation who had been trained to isolate a virusfrom a single patient sample, this was, at best, work that needed to becarefully confirmed by an additional demonstration that this artificiallycreated virus had a natural history of infection in humans or anyspecies—something Silverman could not demonstrate. Without that step, his workremained incomplete.Since 2009, Mikovits had proposed that Silverman’s infectious molecular clonecould vary slightly from what actually existed in human beings, since allviruses evolve and change and Silverman’s “crazy quilt” was not a naturalcreation. She contended that this could cause problems with viral detection.Mikovits had argued that point in a roundtable discussion at the Invest in MEConference in May of 2010.Mikovits claimed that they had to “use a natural isolate or all bets are off asfar as negative studies are concerned.”7 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach19fn_598]Others disagreed and contended it made no difference. The timing, however, was acritical factor. If Silverman had revealed to Mikovits or Ruscetti that theinformation that their infectious molecular clone had been created from threedifferent samples rather than one—in 2009 rather than belatedly in the summer of2011—Mikovits’s team would have had additional ammunition for their concerns,and likely would have prompted them to ask for additional controls.While the process of viral isolation from a single patient sample was much moretime-consuming than what Silverman and Das Gupta had done, Mikovits wouldcontinue to believe it was the superior method.Mikovits couldn’t help but view Silverman’s two-year delay in telling her thisinformation as a sharp diversion from standard scientific protocol. Thescientific community expects that a scientist will reveal both the strengths andflaws of their work so that other researchers, particularly collaborators, mightaccurately consider it. A scientist wasn’t supposed to conceal the potentialflaws of their work like some TV commercial pitch-man.This failure would make it difficult for Mikovits to trust the work of Silvermanand Das Gupta again. If they had revealed this information at the beginning ofthe investigation, the molecular clone could have served many useful purposes,such as being an analog for the virus until a complete sequence was generatedfrom an actual human derived isolate.And while Mikovits considered their infectious molecular clone to be just anapproximation for the virus from the beginning, for the majority of the field itwas the only viral sequence they’d consider allegedly linked to ME/CFS or otherdiseases, until the publication of the Lo/Alter paper in September 2010 thatfound variant mouse leukemia viruses (MLVs).* * *Once Silverman and Das Gupta had engineered their full-length molecular clone ina plasmid construct, it was transfected into cells to generate large volumes ofvirus for study. To explain further, plasmids are best understood as molecularfactories for generating viruses and cellular proteins. A plasmid is not avirus.A plasmid is a small, circular, double-stranded DNA molecule, which can be cutwith certain enzymes, new DNA inserted, then reattached behind a promoter whichturns on the production of the genes in the DNA. The plasmid is then insertedinto cells through a process called transfection. Transfection involves alteringthe cell to open up pores in the cellular membrane so that the plasmids canenter into them. This is commonly performed using either electrical current ordetergents.Once inside the right cells such as LNCaP, the plasmid will churn out virus.A scientist working with plasmids needs to have a way to identify them, andluckily there are a few ways to make such identification. A plasmid can havecertain genes inserted, like those for antibiotic resistance, or even the genesthat make a jellyfish glow, which can then be used to mark those cells thatcontain the plasmid (in the case of jellyfish genes, through bioluminescencethat actually illuminates the plasmid). Another way of identifying plasmidcontamination is to look for the promoter sequences not contained in humancells.There was much evidence beyond the early electron micrograph that XMRV was anatural infection and neither plasmid contamination nor contamination with 22rv1lab contaminant had anything to do with the evidence of a related XMRV thatMikovits and her team isolated from the ME/CFS patient samples.First, Silverman had collaborated with a specialist in viral integration at theUniversity of California, Los Angeles, to confirm that prostate tissue samplesshowed the retrovirus had integrated into human DNA.8[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach19fn_599]Second, there was a team from Emory University that had also shown the virus inhuman tissue, although they were only able to detect sequences of the virus, notthe entire virus.9 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach19fn_600]Third, Ila Singh had detected viral proteins in prostate cancer tissue. All ofthese studies had been published between 2006 and the publication of their workin 2009.Whenever a question would arise regarding the sequence of the virus, Mikovitswould contact Silverman to ask whether he was certain of the data.Silverman would remind her of the published literature he had generated at theCleveland Clinic, the work done by the Emory team, and others.By early March of 2009, because of the difficulty in obtaining full lengthsequences, Mikovits and Ruscetti would raise the possibility the virus isolatedfrom ME/CFS patients was not Silverman’s XMRV. Silverman told them everythingwas done correctly in his lab at the Cleveland Clinic and they believed him.After all, he had “discovered” XMRV.The envelope of XMRV Silverman was closely related to spleen-focus forming virus(SFFV) envelope, the virus envelope upon which they had based their antibodytest. The antibody test detecting reactivity to SFFV Env could detect not onlyantibodies to Silverman XMRV, but also to related virus envelopes. Mikovits wasconfident their test was detecting a related XMRV as they had validated it usingappropriate competition studies.* * *Plasmid contamination was another issue altogether and Ruscetti was astoundedwhen Silverman first raised the plasmid contamination issue in a cryptic,roundabout manner with Frank Ruscetti in June 4–8, 2011, at the 15thInternational Conference on Human Retrovirology, HTLV, and Related Viruses inLeuven, Belgium.The conference was an opportunity to discuss recent data on the pathophysiologyof human retroviruses with American as well as international researchers. One ofthe sessions was chaired by Robert Silverman and dealt exclusively with XMRV.10[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach19fn_601]As chair of the session, Silverman invited himself to give a talk on XMRV thathe titled “Human Infection or Lab Artifact: Will the Real XMRV Please StandUp?”11 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach19fn_602] His presentation left little doubtthat as of June 2011 Silverman considered XMRV to be a human infection. A partof the abstract is reproduced below:“Among the confounding factors are the potential for lab contamination withsimilar or identical viruses or viral sequences originating in mice. In somestudies, relatively contamination-resistant methods (e.g. IHC, FISH, andantibody detection) suggest that either XMRV or a similar type of virus ispresent in some patients. Evidence for and against genuine infections of humanswith this intriguing virus (and/or related viruses) will be discussed.”Following Silverman was Shyh-Ching Lo, the collaborator with Harvey Alter on theXMRV confirmation paper.After Shyh-Ching Lo’s talk, during what was supposed to be the question andanswer session, Mikovits saw Kuan-Teh Jeang, the editor of the journalRetrovirology, stand up with some other researchers and start shouting, “Stopthis waste of money! Stop this research now! We should be spending theseresources on people with real viruses and real diseases!”12[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach19fn_603]As the chair of the session Silverman tried to calm the crowd, but they didn’tappear to be mollified. Mikovits had never seen any behavior like it in thecourse of her thirty years in science, even though these gatherings had grownincreasingly dramatic.Although the outburst had come after Lo’s talk, it was clearly aimed at FrankRuscetti and Judy Mikovits, who were seen as the investigators who started thisresearch. Counter-attackers were trying to shout them down with as much subtletyas an unruly mob. Wasn’t this supposed to be science?The title of Frank Ruscetti’s presentation was “Development of XMRV Producing BCell Lines from Lymphomas from Patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.”13[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach19fn_604] Ruscetti presented the details behind thevirus infection of B cells and the increased rate of certain types of cancersamong the patients with ME/CFS, the issue (B cells) that had first drawnMikovits to study the disease. The meeting abstract gave a condensed account ofRuscetti’s presentation at the Leuven Conference. Ruscetti noted that theincidence of non-Hodkin’s lymphoma in the general US population was 0.02percent, but was nearly 5 percent of the ME/CFS patients. This translated into along-time ME/CFS patient being 250 times more likely to come down withnon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma than a typical healthy person, an astronomical figure. Hethen observed that:Additionally, development of cancer coincides with an outgrowth of gamma delta Tcells with specific clonal T-cell receptor gamma. We hypothesized that infectionwith XMRV and/or other viruses can trigger a dysregulated immune response whichfavors the development of B-cell lymphoma.14[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach19fn_605]Accompanying the non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma was an abnormal population of gammadelta T cells, an important component of the immune system.These data led Ruscetti and Mikovits to suggest that infection with XMRV eitheralone or in combination with other coinfections (such as those commonly found inME/CFS patients, just as with HIV/AIDS patients) might trigger an abnormalimmune response that was favorable to the development of this type of cancer.Ruscetti detailed the numbers of ME/CFS patients with these rare types ofcancer, their lab results, then concluded:Therefore XMRV infection may accelerate the development of B cell malignanciesby either chronic stimulation of the immune system and/or by direct infection ofthe B-cell lineage. Since viral load in peripheral blood is low, these datasuggest that B cells in tissues such as spleen and lymph nodes could be an invivo reservoir for XMRV.15 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach19fn_606]Ruscetti’s presentation covered several key points. The 11 ME/CFS patients withlymphomas or associated disorders all tested positive for XMRV, and 9 of the 11were positive for the T cell rearrangements, which seemed to be a key indicatorof a poorly functioning immune system.Four B cell lines from patients began spontaneously producing XMRV virus.One of the arguments against XMRV as a disease-causing pathogen was that even ifthe virus was able to infect humans, the human immune system would be able totamp it down and control it. Specifically, the researchers argued that APOBEC3G,an antiviral enzyme, would fight off any such retrovirus.Ruscetti and Mikovits found that the virus was replicating in these patientseven though APOBEC3G was present.The researchers who opposed further investigation of XMRV and neuroimmunedisorders presented various objections, but all these lacked an explanation asto why people with ME/CFS had a rate of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma 250 times greaterthan the regular population. A retroviral hypothesis fit the presentation ofME/CFS and retroviruses had twice before been associated with ME/CFS.Although Mikovits was aware of how heated scientific controversies can become,it was in Leuven she saw the first evidence of the angry mob of scientists thatCoffin would say a few months later in the journal Science would “burn her atthe stake.”* * *Mikovits could not forget the behavior of the chief editor of Retrovirology,Kuan-Teh Jeang.Why was the anger directed only at XMRV in ME/CFS and not in prostate cancer?Was it because Mikovits had suggested this retrovirus might be linked to otherdiseases besides ME/CFS, like autism?Was it because Mikovits was raising the possibility that there might be other asyet unidentified retroviruses associated with neurological conditions, such asautism and even cancers, which were rising at dramatic rates?Was that so horrible a possibility that a scientist testing viable hypothesesdeserved to be burned at the stake?And though Mikovits was worn down by the controversy, first over suspected mouseDNA contamination, then Coffin’s hybrid virus, and soon enough over theSilverman plasmid contamination, she knew there were many dramatic and pressingquestions raised, and that she had to persevere.It was during one of the breaks between the sessions that Silverman approachedRuscetti and said to him that Das Gupta really felt bad about what happened.Ruscetti was confused.What did Das Gupta have to feel bad about?Silverman told Ruscetti that the some of the positive samples from WPI sequencedin his lab were contaminated by sequences present in the Silverman XMRV plasmid.If plasmid contamination was suspected, the controls he had told them he haddone in the beginning should have shown plasmid contamination two years ago.Silverman had just given a talk in which he strongly supported the idea thatXMRV was an actual human infection. Was he now suddenly bailing on ME/CFS andXMRV? There had been multiple lines of evidence of a system-wide immunedysfunction, and a retrovirus was still a viable hypothesis.Silverman had been at their side, defending their research against the negativestudies, and even refusing calls to retract their publication in Science, butall that was about to change.* * *In an attempt to distance himself from the ME/CFS and XMRV controversy,Silverman was planning to give his collaborators little time to determinewhether his XMRV plasmid theory of contamination was valid.In an email Silverman sent at 5:59 p.m. on July 6, 2011, to his coauthors, heattached the data showing contamination in his lab and asked them to let himknow in the next two days if they had any comments or whether they believeddifferent actions should be taken.16 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach19fn_607]All of the coauthors were both shocked and disturbed by this email. He was nowgiving them a two-day window to respond to his discovery of plasmidcontamination before presenting it to Science, and exposing what could be adisastrous scenario, before they could offer any defense. This was not standardprotocol. Frank Ruscetti composed a reply to Silverman and sent it at 8:01 a.m.on the following morning, July 7, 2011.Dear Bob and co-authors:I find this study incomplete. In the interest of getting the scientific truthout, before it is submitted, one should do the complete science and figure outthe source of the contamination. It would seem appropriate that the Silvermanlab do an equal number of XMRV positive DNA samples made from prostate cancersamples at roughly the same time as the CFS samples for cmv and neo primers. Ialso think the Silverman lab should test the DNA made from the same patientsamples (same time and WPI processing) made at the NCI from Mike Dean. Our labshave some of the same DNA but those from the Dean lab would be a lesscontentious set of DNA to use.Let me know your thoughts.Regards,Frank.17 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach19fn_608]But Silverman did not seem interested in discovering the source ofcontamination, only in putting the XMRV in ME/CFS investigation behind him. Hewrote back later that day, saying that while the source of the contaminationinterested them, it would not change the fact that figure 1 of the Sciencearticle was wrong. He also stated that they might never know the source of thecontamination, an assertion that Ruscetti and Mikovits found to display anastonishing lack of scientific curiousity.18[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach19fn_609]How could Silverman not be concerned with finding the source of thecontamination and how it might have affected their research? What infuriatedRuscetti and Mikovits more than anything was the material he was planning tosubmit to Science.The letter implied that the contamination had taken place at Mikovits’s lab atthe WPI. On the one hand he was saying in his email to them that they mightnever figure out the source of the contamination, he was clearly saying where hebelieved it had taken place in what he was sending to Science.Ruscetti wrote him back a strongly worded email on July 7, leaving little doubtas to his opinion.Dear Bob:I find your answer disingenuous to say the least. The source of contamination isof interest to us, but having that answer will not change the fact that Fig. 1is erroneous. (italics added) Depending on the source of contamination, it willdetermine whether all the figures or just fig. 1 is discredited. All statementsin this field about contamination pinpoint the problem, science demands that wedo so also. We may never figure out the source of the contamination, but we needto make public that the interpretation of figure 1 is just plain wrong. (italicsadded) The reality is since the publication of the paper in 2009 nobody hasbelieved fig 1 is correct so why the rush to publish before doing theexperiments we suggest. Second we all suspect (you may already know thus thecomment you said to me in Belgium that Joy feels awful about it) the source ofcontamination is your lab.These facts should be either experimentally tested or written in your letter orwe will send to Science in a letter from the other authors these facts . . .19[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach19fn_610]Ruscetti then listed a number of ways that they might test the samples which hadbeen relied upon in the Science article, and brought up what he believed wereaccusations that contamination had taken place at either the Whittemore PetersonInstitute, or the National Cancer Institute. Ruscetti finished off the email:“You protest too much. All this will be seen as an attempt to say that thecontamination could not have occurred in the Silverman lab.”“The CFS and healthy control PBMC DNA samples were treated identically. Then whydid you insist that the samples not be blinded? Why did you coerce Lombardi intoculturing more patient samples without our permission or knowledge? These werethe identical PBMC DNA samples in the original tubes that were used to producefigure 1 of Lombardi et al., Science (2009).”I plea with you to do the experiments I suggested. What difference is anothermonth? If your LAB is as pure as Caesar’s wife as you suggest, then you havenothing to worry about.Regards,Frank.20 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach19fn_611]Ruscetti was laying out what seemed to him be a logical, well-reasoned argumentfor a careful process, not just for the scientific community at large, but forthe patients who had waited decades for answers. Silverman relented and delayedsubmission. Ruscetti got DNA from the 29 of the 30 samples including the 11samples published in figure 1, and split them for plasmid detection in WPI andan independent lab.None of the samples showed evidence of plasmid contamination.Ruscetti told this to Silverman in late July 2011. Neither Mikovits nor Ruscettiever heard from Silverman again. Silverman submitted his partial retraction toScience in August.* * *Mikovits and Ruscetti belatedly came to see what they believed was the biggerpicture.They concluded that Silverman had been having lengthy discussions with JohnCoffin, who was trying to convince Silverman that his viral discovery had beenan artifact, an account which would be backed up by Hillary Johnson’s article inDiscover magazine in March of 2013.21 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach19fn_612] AtCoffin’s urging, Silverman had investigated and found plasmid contamination withXMRV in some of his samples and wanted to retract his contribution to theoriginal Science paper.Ruscetti suggested they test other sets of samples for XMRV plasmidcontamination, using the identical samples from the NCI and the WPI. Silvermanresponded with what seemed like evasions, noting that while the source was ofinterest to him, it still wouldn’t change the fact that figure 1 was inaccurate.There was little arguing with this point. However, Silverman continued to say,“We may never figure out the source of the contamination,” which, whilesuperficially true, begs the question of how does one know until you performedthe experiment?Error analysis in science is supposed to be just as rigorous as the precedingexperiments.* * *Mikovits and her collaborators still fully believed in their evidence regardingan association between an XMRV-like retrovirus and ME/CFS, despite whatSilverman had suggested.They had been rigorous in sorting out the issue already.There were the positive results from the Spleen-Focus Forming Virus antibodytest, their own gag sequences, partial env sequences, gag and env protein,protein detection in unmanipulated plasma, and even the electron micrographpictures of the virus budding from the cellular membrane of patient cells.Still, they worked to determine whether there was any validity to Silverman’sclaim of XMRV plasmid contamination.On or about July 8, 2011, Dr. Mikovits called into her office Hagen, Pfost, andLombardi, who worked on project X, and asked them all to bring theirnotebooks.22 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach19fn_613]Lombardi brought in four Xeroxed pages from his notebook. “This is it?” Mikovitsasked. “This is all the work you’ve ever done in the research lab?” She wasaghast at his paltry contribution, standing there next to the other associateswith their rigorously detailed work. Lombardi answered in the affirmative,saying that the rest of his notebooks were proprietary information, whichbelonged to the for-profit clinical company, VIP Dx.Mikovits made a mental note to revise his level of effort in the R01 annualprogress report she had recently filed with Carli West Kinne. Mikovits took thepages from Lombardi and put them aside. Her only concern was trying to determineif any possibility of contamination existed in their earlier work.In her review of Katy Hagen’s notebook, Mikovits found a peculiar entry forMarch 23, 2009. Katy kept a meticulous lab book, but her handwriting was oftendifficult to read.Mikovits could make out that on March 23, 2009, Lombardi had directed Hagen toculture the identical 30 samples that WPI had sent to Silverman twice before sothe Silverman lab could do single round PCR, which he wanted for Figure 1 in themanuscript.Apparently after Mikovits told Silverman they were not going to send the samplesagain because neither lab could get positive results from single round PCR,Silverman had asked Lombardi to send them. Mikovits asked Katy if one of theentries said XMRV positive (+) or XMRV negative (-). Katy looked at her entry inthe lab book. “That’s XMRV positive.”Mikovits felt like she might have a stroke. Culturing infected cells withpatient cells would not result in plasmid contamination, but could have resultedin infection of those cells through aerosolization as Gazdar’s lab had justdiscovered. She recalled how on January 24, 2009, a few days after signing thecollaboration agreement with Ruscetti and Silverman she’d emailed the HIVdecontamination protocols to Katy as soon as she could. Katy even taped theprotocols in her lab book.The critical thing to do for the integrity of the work was to prevent againstthe possibility of contamination.Mikovits immediately called a meeting with Harvey to explain what she’duncovered, including the four pages of work in the research lab for whichLombardi had been paid for 50 percent effort. Harvey asked why she thoughtLombardi had violated the protocols.In an email to Harvey, she cited Lombardi’s arrogance and refusal to takedirection from a woman. Asked why she thought he’d hidden it for two years? Hewas a coward! Mikovits was furious.Annette’s reaction to the latest Silverman controversy was immediatelyprotective of their fiduciary interests. The Whittemores were making apresentation to a major diagnostic company, which had given WPI $150,00 permonth since October 2010 for the intellectual property rights to the serologytest.Annette sent Judy an email directing her to make sure that Silverman plasmidcontamination theory did not get out until they could make their presentation tothe company July 24th, 2011, so that the next financial installments could comein. Cultured virus is not plasmid contamination, so now they had two sources ofpotential contamination to track down.* * *An idea Mikovits had been considering from the very start of the research wasthat the disease-causing potential of XMRV might be related to the body’sreaction to proteins on the envelope of the virus.There existed all sorts of variations on this idea, with one notion that somewere defective viruses expressing some proteins, but not what is known as areplication competent virus. For a virus to be infectious and transmissible, itmust be replication competent.If a virion consisted mainly of an envelope, with defective genetic sequencesinside, most scientists will consider the organism to be of little concern tohuman health. Mikovits’s postdoctoral work had shown defective HTLV-1 virionscould still express pathogenic proteins.Another group of scientists, Sandy Ruscetti among them, have spent their careerstrying to determine whether proteins in the envelope of the virus might becausing an abnormal immune system response and inducing autoimmune disorders.The process is similar to an allergic reaction.A peanut is not inherently dangerous. Most people can eat a peanut butter andjelly sandwich with a smile and a satisfied belly. But in some the bodymistakenly identifies peanuts as dangerous, floods the system with antibodies,and causes lethal reactions, including anaphylaxis and death.Some believed it was likely that in some cases the envelope of a virus might becausing an autoimmune reaction in which the body was attacking certain types ofcells, leading to diseases like cancer and even neurological conditions.In a sense, this was a solution that would allow both camps to be right.Coffin and others could proclaim that XMRV Silverman, or whatever closelyrelated retrovirus might eventually be linked to ME/CFS and other conditions,was not an infectious exogenous virus as the term is generally understood.Mikovits and Ruscetti could say in turn that an XMRV-like retrovirus was linkedto conditions like ME/CFS and possibly autism, but the mechanism of action fordamage was not a classic infection per se, but the body’s autoimmune response toproteins of a poorly infectious defective virus.This approach could open up many intriguing avenues of investigation. If theenvelope of the virus acted as an autoantigen, the question would turn to theimmune response of the individual. Just as many people could eat peanuts withoutsuffering harm, perhaps the majority of the population could harbor this viruswithout any ill effects.In the case of autism, maybe infants could be tested for the presence of thevirus, and then if they tested positive, a different vaccination schedule wouldbe provided, just as was done for HIV-positive children. Perhaps by simplymonitoring of the immune functions of a child, one could track whether thevaccination was likely to cause an autoimmune response.This was not such a radical idea, just often happening on scientific “islands”outside of the Mikovits team.Even study into the long-term progression of treated AIDS—that is, thosepatients on antiretroviral therapy to control the HIV virus—found that due tothe now-longer lifespans of treated AIDS patients, inflammation andautoimmune-like reactions were major players in ongoing symptomatology and evenaccelerated aging. As reported by AIDS journalist Liz Highleyman:“Untreated HIV infection causes inflammation and, despite ART, it does notnormalize,” Steven Deeks, professor of medicine at the University ofCalifornia-San Francisco (UCSF), explained at a post-CROI workshop sponsored byProject Inform. “This leads to all sorts of ‘badness.’ Some 20 presentationsshowed this same phenomenon linking HIV, inflammatory biomarkers, age-relatedsymptoms, and immunosenescence [accelerated aging of the immune system].’”23[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach19fn_614]So even in more accepted retrovirology, as Highleyman continued, the end resultof classic autoimmunity and the inflammation from a persistent or controlledinfection could lead to similar end results:This fine-tuned system [of the immune system clearing problems and then turningitself down] can go awry, however, when the immune system is faced with a threatit cannot overcome. This occurs, for example, during persistent infection. Othercauses of chronic inflammation include autoimmune conditions (in which theimmune system attacks the body’s own tissues), obesity, chronic stress, andexposure to toxins such as tobacco smoke.24 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach19fn_615]But first, before diverging into questions about envelope material and allergicor inflammatory responses, everyone wanted to know whether Silverman’s XMRVplasmid had contaminated the data in the 2009 Science paper linking XMRV withME/CFS.It was an important question and nobody wanted the answer more than Mikovits.* * *Mikovits, Ruscetti, and Pfost would spend the summer of 2011 trying to answerthat question. Unfortunately, she had to direct most of her attention to theBlood Working Group.The WPI and NCI focused the month of July on completing the BWG panel due July31 and Judy Mikovits asked Frank Ruscetti to sit on the WPI staff meetings.There had developed a great deal of tension for Mikovits as Harvey Whittemoreinsisted on running Mikovits’s lab meetings. The Whittemores were unhappy aboutthe negative data from Mikovits and Ruscetti when the BSRI decoded the samples.Lombardi would never say anything and would never bring any raw data to evaluateuntil last meeting before the deadline (August 1). When they saw the data,Mikovits and Ruscetti were stunned beyond belief.In a written recollection Ruscetti stated, “The data presented by Vinnie for usto send to the BWG as a serology test was the worst data I have ever seenpresented as a finished product. Immunoblots with no molecular weight markers,most have background, which makes identifying the bands difficult if notimpossible. The positive bands were marked with arrows, which was good becausewithout the arrows they were indistinguishable. The positive bands were onlyguesses. Every scientist to whom I showed it only laughed.”25[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach19fn_616]Furthermore, despite the fact that VIP Dx was charging patients for the culturemethod and reporting positives to patients, Lombardi had failed to produce anyusable culture data. It brought in focus ever more clearly the problems with theclinical lab.Annette Whittemore responded to these concerns by writng in an email to Mikovitscopying Ruscetti, “This complete and utter failure of the BWG was no one’s faultbut yours and blaming the clinical lab for your poor decision making isunacceptable.”26 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach19fn_617] In a separate emailwritten that same day, Annette thanked Ruscetti for his help, but did not blamehim for making the same decision. Ruscetti goes onto say that Annette then“ordered Judy to submit the clinical data to the BWG,” which Mikovits refused todo.27 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach19fn_618]When the head of the Blood Working Group, Dr. Michael Busch came to the WPI andtoured the clinical lab a few weeks later, Ruscetti says he sent an email whichstated, “I was under impressed by Vinnie to say the least and what I saw andunderstood in terms of validation and QC [quality control] of the assays in theclinical lab was disturbing.”28 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach19fn_619]* * *On September 23, 2011, Mikovits presented her findings at the InternationalAssociation for ME/CFS, which was held in Ottawa, Canada. The session waschaired by Dr. Jose Montoya of Stanford University who also presented his workon the “Role of the Immune Response in CFS.”29[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach19fn_620]Mikovits then presented “The Case FOR Human Gamma Retroviruses (XMRV/HGRV) inME/CFS,” while John Coffin presented the case “AGAINST XMRV.”30[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach19fn_621]As the issue of XMRV was becoming problematic, Mikovits was now referring to thepossible pathogen by a more generic name, a “human gamma-retrovirus,” since datastill suggested she was seeing evidence of a gamma retrovirus in patients. Shestarted her presentation by showing an electron micrograph of a humangamma-retrovirus budding from the cell of a ME/CFS patient.31[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach19fn_622] The showing of a similar electronmicrograph by Luc Montagnier had convinced the world that HIV retrovirusexisted. She even had the same microscopist that Montagnier had used taking thepicture.Despite being depicted as some kind of renegade scientist, her work was both “bythe book” of classic science, and “in the footsteps” of a giant HIV predecessor,because she wanted to get it right.The next slide showed the direct isolation of XMRV/HGRV protein from the plasmaof ME/CFS patients. This was the test in which they used the antibodies almostlike magnets to draw out the proteins from the plasma. And those proteins couldonly be created in an actual living organism. If they weren’t in the blood atthe time it was drawn, no contamination could explain that level of protein.Next she showed that these retroviruses could infect another cell line, a keytest of whether a virus might be pathogenic.Taking Silverman’s latest theory head-on she had a schematic of the circular DNAof the XMRV-containing VP-62 plasmid, showing the various markers that wouldallow them to detect it in any of their samples.Mikovits was fond of saying that virology “is not rocket science,” and oftenthought the field was more akin to the type of knowledge a good car mechanichad. If one suspects contamination with a certain agent—in this case,Silverman’s XMRV/VP-62 plasmid—one knows it has certain genetic markers thatwill allow a scientist to identify it as a manmade creation. After knowing thosecharacteristics, one can test for them. If they are present one hascontamination. If they aren’t, there’s no contamination.It’s like taking your car to a mechanic and testing to see if the brake pads arestill good.Mikovits showed that in figure 1 of the original Science paper that was preparedby Silverman of the Cleveland Clinic, some samples did contain the VP-62plasmid. However, the original DNA samples, which were housed at the WPI weretested by Max Pfost and Frank Ruscetti were free of the VP-62 plasmid.An independent reanalysis of the same samples also showed the samples to be freeof the plasmid, or other mouse contamination, the previous theory Coffin hadheld against XMRV.There was no “crap”—mouse or otherwise—in their argument. The next slide showedthe cell-free transmission of XMRV to LNCaP cells.The following slide showed results from a single patient, demonstrating thatthey appeared to have two separate strains of a human gamma-retrovirus, a resultoften found with other human retroviruses. The next few slides containedinformation about the results of the Blood Working Group, which Mikovits hadbeen working with since shortly after the original Science paper was published.The report was to be published during the Ottawa conference, as well as thearticle “False Positive” in Science. All of this negative press was slated to bepublished on the same day as her talk at the Ottawa conference. She wonderedruefully which story would get the greater coverage, the article in Science, theresults from the Blood Working Group, or her explanation of the latest findings?She’d never been much of a believer in the idea that, public perception oncertain vital issues was manipulated by powerful forces, but in this instanceshe felt increasingly that only one side of the debate was being presented.The Blood Working Group had been created with a single goal in mind, todetermine whether XMRV posed a threat to the blood supply. It had becomesomething else, a stalking horse for the association of XMRV with ME/CFS.Specifically, the Blood Working Group had been using Silverman’s VP-62 clone asthe control for finding the virus in individuals. As far as anybody could tell,Silverman’s VP-62 clone was different enough in its sequence to the sequences Loand Alter were detecting (after their paper was published they became members ofthe blood working group.)And while the Blood Working Group had been finding evidence of XMRV-like gag andpol sequences in some patients, they tightened the standards for calling asample positive by saying there had to be both gag and pol sequences in thesample in order to call it positive.Silverman’s infectious molecular clone was useful for doing animal studies todetermine what might happen to the immune system of the infected animals. TheEmory study showed that viral and proviral signals from Silverman XMRVdisappeared from the blood within a month, but remained in the tissues wherethey could be reactivated by immune stimulation, such as happens when one gets avaccination. In most of the Emory animals, the testing showed that the antibodyresponses were generally low in magnitude and short in duration.32[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach19fn_623]Would this explain the lack of positivity in the blood? When extrapolated to thehuman population it made detection problematic.* * *Mikovits next went on to the test, which she believed to be the most reliable indetecting this still elusive pathogen, or whatever degraded virus might becausing an immune reaction. She fell back again on the assay used to detectantibodies to the envelope of the Spleen-Focus Forming Virus, which had proventhe most reliable evidence of XMRV/HGRV detection.In her next slide she showed the antibodies they had detected in human samplesreacting to multiple proteins of XMRV, including P12, P15 (Ma/E), Rec Env, P30,and gp70.She also showed how the gold standard of molecular virology, the Western Blotmethod, could also detect the gp70 and P30 proteins in this population. Mikovitswas careful to note on the slide that the “Ability to recognize XMRV proteinsdoes not mean that XMRV was the immunogen. It could be any HGRV (humangamma-retrovirus) or a cross-reactive protein.”33[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach19fn_624]Still, the data was showing that something was generating these aberrantproteins. Her answer to the problems of detection was the use of next-generationsequencing and she showed the results of some of that research she’d conductedin collaboration with the company Hemispherx Biopharma. The next generationsequencing had detected XMRV/HGRV in seven of eight ME/CFS patients and in onlytwo out of seventeen controls.Her conclusion was that the next generation sequencing offered a solution to theproblems of the detection of these viral proteins. For future plans regardingnext generation sequencing she suggested increasing the sequencing coverage foreach DNA sample, using appropriate age, sex, and geographical matched non-ME/CFScontrols, and looking at more than the seventy-five base pairs alreadyidentified. This would enable them to investigate viral-human chimeras, whichwould show the integration of the virus into human DNA.Mikovits showed the research Frank Ruscetti had presented in Leuven,Belgium—specifically how three B-cell lines from patients who tested positivefor XMRV had spontaneously immortalized, a precursor of cancer.The take-away message for a patient with ME/CFS was basically a verydisheartening, ”Life sucks and then you die.” In her summary Mikovits made thefollowing points:• We have shown that we can detect HGRV/XMRV footprints in the blood byserology and nucleic acid analysis without any evidence of contamination.• Some CFS plasma contains HGRV/XMRV proteins and antibodies that recognizeXMRV/HGRV viral antigens.• XMRV producing Hematopoietic cell lines (B and NK-like) were developed fromCFS patients.• XMRV/HGRV-infected individuals exhibit cytokine profiles characteristic ofinflammatory processes.• Sequence data indicate there are different strains of XMRV/HGRVs that caninfect humans.In the conclusions section she wrote:• The pathogenic potential of HGRVs in ME/CFS deserves further exploration.34[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach19fn_625]* * *During the question and answer session, she’d been asked about the XMRV testbeing sold by the clinical lab founded by the Whittemores, VIP Dx.35[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach19fn_626] The VIP Dx test had been used by the BloodWorking Group. The VIP Dx test had used Silverman’s XMRV VP-62 infectiousmolecular clone as the control.She answered the question the only way she knew how, by telling what shethought.Mikovits said that given the results of the Blood Working Group, the VIP Dx testcould no longer in good conscience be used.36[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach19fn_627] Prior to the Ottawa conference Mikovitsknew that more than three thousand people had been tested at VIP Dx, and thatthe cost for the various tests ranged from approximately $500 to $700 dollars,making it somewhere between a million and a half and a little over two milliondollars that the test had thus-far generated.Mikovits might have been overstepping her boundaries in answering the question.She was head of the research lab, not the clinical lab. In the end, all ascientist has is his or her integrity, and she didn’t want anybody to everbelieve she would shade the truth, regardless of whom it might offend. They hadasked her opinion and she had given it, without regard for the consequences.That was the duty of a scientist.* * *And now began what Mikovits considered to be the wholesale abandonment of thepatients.The medical community did not want to look at the question of whether mouseretroviruses (probably of the type which had contaminated research labs fordecades) had somehow jumped into the human population. Once again, scientiststurned their backs on ME/CFS patients, like a herd of skittish deer.The release of the findings from the Blood Working Group on the day ofMikovits’s talk at the Ottawa Conference was part of the strategy. It wascurious how the mission of the Blood Working Group had morphed from the questionof whether XMRV posed a danger to the blood supply, to whether XMRV wasassociated with ME/CFS.Also released on the day of Mikovits’s talk (September 23, 2011) was an articlein Science entitled “False Positive” by Jon Cohen and Martin Enserink.37[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach19fn_628]The article noted the original findings published two years earlier in Sciencelinking a gamma retrovirus to CFS, and that questions had been raised. Andleading the charge was the man she had tried her entire professional life toavoid. In the article, Gallo is quoted as saying,Once claims of etiology were made, I just gasped for breath. My own experienceargued to me that it’s best to stay away from this one.38[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach19fn_629]For somebody attempting to figure out the investigative approach of the publichealth authorities, the real question did not seem to be whether scientists hadfound a promising lead into what was causing ME/CFS, but whether they weredefending XMRV as if the retrovirus was the wealthy defendant in a high-profilemurder trial.Discussing the Lo and Alter study, the Science article by Cohen and Enserinkmentioned how many previous efforts at discovering what lay behind ME/CFS hadfailed to pan out, suggesting that this was just one more such regrettablefailure.39 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach19fn_630]And of course they had to include Coffin’s remark comparing Mikovits to Joan ofArc and that “the scientists will burn her at the stake, but her faithfulfollowing will have her canonized.”40 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach19fn_631]Cohen and Enserink gave the final words in this section of the article toMikovits, noting that she viewed the Lo/Alter paper as confirming her work andthat from the beginning:she viewed XMRV as one of many gammaretroviruses, which includes the MLVsinvolved with CFS. In the Lombardi study, some patients tested negative in PCRtests for XMRV and yet produced MLV-related proteins, she claimed, but theydecided to count them as negatives. She has another serious regret about thepaper. “I’d not put XMRV into the title,” Mikovits says. “We never considered itwould be a single sequence41 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach19fn_632]The number from the healthy controls in the Mikovits study meant that more thanten million Americans were infected with a mouse leukemia related retrovirus.Then along came Lo and Alter who found another mouse leukemia retrovirus presentin 86.5 percent of ME/CFS patients and 6.8 percent of healthy controls.The 6.8 percent number in the Lo/Alter study translated to more than twenty-onemillion citizens in the United States infected with a mouse-related leukemiaretrovirus. With somewhere between ten and twenty-one million Americans infectedwith a mouse related leukemia retrovirus whether or not linked to a debilitatingcondition like ME/CFS, and possibly other neuroimmune diseases like autism, itdidn’t appear that anybody was raising an alarm.Why?Has it become bad form in science to ask inconvenient questions?* * *A few days later, after she left the lab on September 29, 2011, Mikovits learnedthat Lombardi, who worked at the clinical lab and not in her research lab, wasclaiming that a cell line purchased with WPI grant money belonged to him.Mikovits knew it was also the end of the government fiscal year and Lombardi hadnot done any work on the grant and had stated as much to Carli West Kinne andAnnette and Harvey in mid-July. If he had not done any work during the reportingperiod it would be a federal crime to claim part of his salary for the grant.In the past few months Mikovits had scientifically defended the XMRV ME/CFSresearch against claims of mouse contamination, Coffin’s hybrid virus, whichcould only have been created after the appearance of ME/CFS, Silverman’sinfectious molecular clone, VP62, which had contaminated samples, plasmidcontamination, and then she’d told her employers that they couldn’t submit theirclinical lab’s data to the Blood Working Group because it was substandard, andthat they had to stop selling their potentially lucrative XMRV blood test.It’s probably not surprising given this chain of events and the stress everybodywas under that, when Mikovits answered her cell phone as she walked home afterwork that day, that it was Annette Whittemore, telling Mikovits she had beenfired for insolence. It seems it’s rude to refuse a direct order to commit afederal crime, thought Mikovits.Mikovits and Annette Whittemore had experienced their share of disagreements inthe past and had been able to resolve them. Mikovits expected they would be ableto sort out all their problems in the next few days.She was very wrong."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTYThe Lipkin StudyShe has come across as a scientist who really believes in the importance oftruth.1 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_633]—Dr. Ian Lipkin, speaking about his collaborationwith Dr. Judy MikovitsMikovits had, in the XMRV skirmishes, developed more respect for the Dr. IanLipkin, “World’s Most Celebrated Virus Hunter,”according to Discover magazine.2[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_634]But Mikovits found that Lipkin could run hot and cold.He was capable of startling generosity, but could also be brusque and spoutnegative opinions with such vehemence that Mikovits felt she had to get up andleave. Despite his place at the pinnacle of the medical research community,Mikovits thought Lipkin must have often been frustrated by how little he couldaffect the course of events when they fought the tide of the prevailing medicalestablishment. But he also had a savvy way of politicking his way through thehierarchy.He would have several opportunities during the course of their collaboration todistance himself from Mikovits without even a formal break, but he didn’t takethem. He could have just pushed the study into obscurity like the illness ME/CFShad done to patients—through an unfavorable chance comment to a reporter or achoice to remain silent when things got heated—that might have signaled a lackof support.Yet in every early instance when the fate of the endeavor hung in the balance,he acted like the quintessential humanist, and rose up on her behalf.When Lipkin spoke to the press and said things she herself might have said,despite his esteemed position, it was as if all the scientists around him hadsuddenly gone deaf, yet he wasn’t attacked the way she was.For example, when Lipkin spoke about autism as he did in an interview withDiscover he could’ve been speaking from the main stage of AutismOne, whichMikovits and Montagnier had been criticized for attending. Asked if autism couldbe another version of a pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder (PANDAS),he replied:It’s possible, in some people. There is probably a group of people, who have agenetic component to autism, and for them, there may not be much of a trigger orany trigger at all required. Another group is genetically predisposed, and ifthey encounter some factor or factors, individually or in combination, it couldresult in the onset or the aggravation of a neurodevelopmental disorder; byfactors I include everything from heavy metals to infection.3[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_635]When Lipkin switched the channel to a program the medical community andscientific press liked, they tuned back in, and lavished him with praise.Despite the role Lipkin tried to play in this growing Greek tragedy, it seemedlike someone else had written their roles.If Mikovits was to be Joan of Arc, burned at the stake by her fellow scientists,perhaps Lipkin would at least stop the scientists from lighting the fire.* * *The trip to New York from southern California on December 15 of 2011, tofinalize plans for the Lipkin study was complicated by a bizarre request fromLipkin.4 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_636] Lipkin told Mikovits she couldn’tfly through Washington Dulles Airport on her way to New York. It all seemed inline with the bizarre edict from Anthony Fauci and Harold Varmus that theNational Cancer Institute would be her home lab for the Lipkin study, but shecouldn’t set foot on the grounds or else she would be escorted away by security.“What do you mean I can’t fly through Dulles?” Dr. Mikovits asked.Lipkin was very kind and patient and the situation rankled him as well. “We allknow you didn’t do anything, Judy. Let’s just try and get your reputation back.”So she steered clear of the nation’s capital as requested.* * *Complying with the Fauci/Varmus edict made it difficult for Mikovits to work onthe study. In doing his part Ruscetti needed to take pictures of the cells hewas working on, then email them to Mikovits. She would look at them on hercomputer as she sat in a coffeehouse in southern California talking to Frankabout what she was seeing. Even with all of these obstructions the workproceeded relatively smoothly, and by May they were ready to unblind thesamples.She had expected the association of XMRV with ME/CFS to go down significantlybased on the new exclusion of patients with:• serologic evidence of infection with human immune-deficiency virus (HIV),• hepatitis B virus,• hepatitis C virus,• Treponema pallidium,• B burgdorferi (the Lyme disease spirochete),• medical or psychiatric illness that might be associated with fatigue,• abnormal serum characteristics, and• thyroid functions.Instead of the association of XMRV to be around 67 percent as she’d found in herstudy, or the 87.5 percent Lo and Alter had found for a wider range of mouseleukemia viruses, the way the population had been whittled down throughexclusions rendered it indistinguishable from a normal cross-section of thepopulation.Had they excluded all of those patients who might have the virus?Still, the spleen-focus forming virus (SFFV) antibody test had come through. Sixpercent of the controls showed evidence of antibodies to something close to amouse leukemia virus and 6 percent of the patients with ME/CFS showed the same.An antibody to SFFV env was in 6 percent of the population, a value confirmed incontrols of all the positive studies. But it didn’t show an association withthis population of so-called “chronic fatigue syndrome” patients.* * *This was the end of a very bad year for Mikovits: the partial retraction of theScience article; her firing and jail time; full retraction by Science inDecember 2011; Lo/Alter retraction in Jan 2012; and now the Lipkin results.After the shock had worn off, she did a post-mortem on what had happened in theLipkin study. She wondered what the point had been. Were they at all interestedin finding out what was happening in ME/CFS and other neurological disorders?Paul Cheney (one of the two original investigators with Dan Peterson in LakeTahoe), was also baffled by many of the exclusions in the Lipkin study. Theexclusion of patients with thyroid problems especially troubled him.“Thyroiditis is fairly common in this illness and there was a recent report, Ibelieve out of the UK, which said that 82 percent of people complaining ofchronic fatigue had evidence of thyroiditis. Another paper showed that one ofthe tissue foci for HHV-6A is the thyroid. Jim Jones, way back when indescribing the first cases of CFS, said 85 percent of them had auto-antibodiesagainst the thyroid. So by definition, 85 percent of CFS/ME patients havethyroiditis.”5 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_637]Cheney’s observations had been made by other scientists, including in a 2008study published in Genomics that found, “statistically significant differencesbetween CFS and control networks determined mainly by remodeling aroundpituitary and thyroid nodes as well as an emergent immune sub-network” that“align with known mechanisms of chronic inflammation and support possibleimmune-mediated loss of thyroid function in CFS.”6[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_638]Cheney was also disturbed by the exclusion of patients with borrelia, thespirochete that causes Lyme disease. He also noted that one of the most commonantigens found in lyme patients is called P41, which is also an early antigen ofHHV-6 and a cleavage product of the SFFV and XMRV envelope precursor.The exclusion of patients with a “medical or psychiatric illness that might beassociated with fatigue” was a giant head-scratcher. “That particularly doesn’tmake much sense. I suppose it’s how hard they hit that.” Many chronic illnessescan cause secondary, often transient, grief and depression. “And medicalconditions associated with fatigue? Well, this is a medical condition associatedwith fatigue, so they’re trying to exclude the very disease they’re supposed tobe looking for.”7 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_639]* * *The overall difficulty Cheney and Mikovits had with the exclusions based oninfection by another agent, was that the very thing that led her to suspect animmune-altering retrovirus in ME/CFS was that putting the blood of thesepatients on a pathogen micro-array made it light up like a Christmas tree.So again, this gated community-style study was akin to excluding AIDS patientsfrom research because of secondary coinfections, rather than including thosewith telltale immune markers. The ME/CFS patients were loaded with viruses,bacteria, and parasites.So the study should examine the reasons why.As with the other negative studies that seemed to be using crab pots to catchunrelated fish, Lipkin’s study appeared to be another survey of the wrongpopulation, those who might never have had ME/CFS to at all.* * *“The one point you could make in favor of Lipkin is that he wanted to create astudy that was airtight, if it was positive,” said Paul Cheney, surveying theCFS/ME landscape from his days as a young physician working with Dan Peterson atLake Tahoe in 1984 to Columbia University in 2012 and the release of the Lipkinstudy. “But he runs the risk of not finding the very thing he was supposed tofind. And that’s the risk he took, and it may have ended up that way,unintended.”8 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_640]For microbiologist, chemist, and CFS/ME patient, Gerwyn Morris, the problemswith the Lipkin study started with the group selected for inclusion.9[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_641] “They used unvalidated, home-made selectioncriteria, not based on any international consensus, which is bad enough, butsomething they cobbled together at the meeting. From that point on in my view,the study has almost no meaning.”To Morris, the Lipkin investigation was as unscientific as a study could be.“Because you do not know whether the patient group you had in the Science study,in terms of underlying etiology or pathophysiology were the same patients thatwere in the Lipkin study. There is absolutely no way of telling. You can’texpect to classify people on the basis of symptom clusters, and expect people tohave the same underlying disease. It’s just nonsense.”10[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_642]Like Cheney, Morris questioned whether the Lipkin study had been designed tofind anything. “If they had been genuinely looking for patients with apossibility of having a retroviral infection, they would have selected patientson the basis of running a very similar cytokine profile that Mikovits andLombardi produced for so-called XMRV positive patients. It’s the sort ofcytokine profile you’d expect from a retrovirus infection of this sort of HTLV-1type, which is very similar in the way it’s replicated with the murine leukemiaviruses. The inclusion criteria were rubbish.”When Morris reviewed both the inclusion and exclusion criteria he said it waslike, “Looking for HIV, but excluding homosexual males, IV drug users, and thosewho’d received a blood transfusion.”11 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_643]* * *For Deckoff-Jones, the former clinical director of the WPI, the problem with theLipkin study was the failure to look for related viruses.“They had to put it to bed. The study was an incredible waste of money becausethey knew the outcome before they started. They should have redesigned it (afterthe revelations about VP-62 and Silverman’s mistake) to look for what was reallythere. And we do have the technology.” Deckoff-Jones felt Lipkin did what was“politically required.” “He didn’t get to be the world’s greatest virus hunterwith three floors and 65 people working under him because he doesn’t know how toplay the system.”12 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_644]* * *Even with all these problems, Mikovits had participated in the deliberations andit was her duty to see it through to the end.“We set out to see if XMRV as defined by Silverman was in the population, and itwasn’t,” Lipkin urged her.And he was right.Still, it felt like they were presenting only one sliver of truth; whether thelab contaminant XMRV Silverman was afflicting ME/CFS patients, not whether aretrovirus existed in ME/CFS at all.The large truth revolved around the question of whether a mouse leukemia relatedretrovirus, or some chimera of mouse and human virus, was causing disease in asignificant number of a well-defined patient population. Lipkin, of course knewthis for he had already collected samples with private money that had beendonated to a private CFS initiative.The one issue, which threatened to derail both her participation and that ofFrank Ruscetti in the study was whether the ensuing article should deal with theissue of antiretroviral therapy.Lipkin had written strong language in the draft condemning the use ofantiretroviral therapy by the patient population.13[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_645] For Mikovits the use of antiretroviraltherapy presented an acceptable risk on a trial basis for these very sickpatients. And besides, the study wasn’t about the use of antiretroviral therapy,so their disagreement wasn’t relevant. If she wasn’t supposed to go beyond theboundaries of what had been agreed to, neither should Lipkin.It all came to a head in August of 2012. Mikovits and Ruscetti had told Lipkinthey’d take their names off the paper if any of the antiretroviral commentsremained in the manuscript.Lipkin called Mikovits while she was meeting with an autism doctor and somepatients. Mikovits was working for free and Lipkin knew her desperate financialsituation brought about by the crushing legal bills she’d had to pay because ofthe Whittemores and the difficulty of finding a job after having her mug shotplastered around the world in Science.Prior to the call, Frank had sent Lipkin an angry email, pointing out that heand Alter would be fine, both professionally and financially, but Judy wasruined. Frank told Ian that Judy would probably never be allowed to set foot ina lab again and had done nothing wrong.This claim by Ruscetti seemed to deeply unsettle Lipkin.When Lipkin called Mikovits she was in still in the autism meeting. She excusedherself and stepped outside. Lipkin’s voice softened as he learned what she wasdoing, continuing to try to help people even though she wasn’t getting any moneyfor it. “I’m trying to help restore your reputation,” he said.“Frank is right. You can’t restore my reputation,” she replied. “I’ll never beable to work again. Nobody will ever believe a word I say, and I didn’t make themistake. The only mistake I made was saying it was Silverman’s XMRV because heclaimed he had a full sequence virus and he didn’t.”Then they got down to negotiating.Lipkin would take out the section of the paper which was critical of the use ofantiretrovirals in the patient population. Judy would keep in the paper theresults of the spleen-focus-forming virus antibody test, showing 6 percent ofcontrols and 6 percent of the patients were positive. The positive numbers forthe spleen-focus forming virus antibody test had remained constant among thepopulation from the original Science paper, through the Singh and Alter-Lostudy, the Blood Working Group, and now the Lipkin study. There was stillsomething unexplained in the blood of ten to twenty million Americans.Mikovits thought that might be enough to let her start to rebuild herreputation.She knew she had to give Lipkin something in return and decided it would be thegag sequences they’d recovered from both the patient and control samples. Itcertainly wasn’t a full sequence, but it could be enough to cause an abnormalimmune responses in some people. She’d argued that the gag sequences should bein the main body of the paper, but Lipkin thought that would confuse the issue.In return for Lipkin taking out his comments on the use of anti-retroviraltherapy and allowing her to keep the data on the results of the antibody testfor the spleen-focus forming virus, she agreed to let the gag sequences beplaced in the supplementary materials.She knew that at the press conference to come she was supposed to be the goodlittle girl, praising the wonderful collaboration between all of theresearchers, and the kind and caring staff of the NIH. And maybe, just maybe,when all the dust had settled she could get back into a lab and find out whatwas really going on with this disease.To help rebuild her career, Lipkin promised they would collaborate with Mikovitsand Ruscetti as coauthors on the next two or three papers he did in ME/CFS.* * *On September 16, 2012, two days before the press conference for the Lipkinstudy, Ian Lipkin sent an email to Judy Mikovits, copying Frank Ruscetti, MartinEnserink of Science, Harvey Alter of the NIH, and John Coffin regarding theapproach he wanted to take at the press conference. The email appeared to havebeen in response to a request from Martin Enserink about the release of theupcoming study and was addressed to Judy but was intended for the entire group.Lipkin wrote that it was important for scientists to recognize that their wordshad an enormous power to influence public opinion. He stated that while hebelieved XMRV met the definition of a virus, it seemed likely to have been achimera created in a laboratory, but the last paragraph of the recent Chiu paperstill left the door open to implicate XMRV in human disease.14[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_646]On September 17, there was a very nice dinner for all the participants in thestudy. During the dinner, Lipkin told Judy he would hire her as a consultant butsaid it would not be for very much money. Judy said that would be fine, addingthat she did not need much money.With everybody aware of what was to be said at the press conference, the stagewas set for the final act of the XMRV in ME/CFS drama.* * *“My name is Ian Lipkin and I’m the John Snow Professor of Epidemiology atColumbia University in the Center for Infection and Immunity. This broadcast iscoming to you from the campus of Columbia University in the city of New York.”15[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_647]Instead of being attired in his usual jeans and sneakers to race between thefloors of his “empire of viruses” like an eager grad student, Lipkin was dressedin a sober suit and tie. His voice was calm, sometimes passionate and evenfunny, but it was that of a scientist wanting to present his findings to thepublic.“I’d like to say it’s a beautiful day here in New York,” Lipkin began. “There issome rain, but there is some blue peeking through which I think is a wonderfulmetaphor for the morning.”Lipkin began by describing the disease and previous research. “Chronic fatiguesyndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis is an unexplained, incapacitating syndromethat afflicts at least a million people in the United States. For many yearsthere has been a thought that it could be attributed to an infectious process ofsome sort because many of the individuals with this syndrome have malaise, nightsweats, lymphadenopathy, sore throat, and fever. And there have been a widerange of microbes that have been proposed as causative agents—herpes virus,borna viruses, borrelia—but none has really captured the attention of thescientific community and the population more than retroviruses.16[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_648]Lipkin noted the papers of Mikovits and the confirmatory study of Harvey Alterof the National Institutes of Health and Shyh-Ching Lo of the Food and DrugAdministration. Lipkin also observed that while many commentators had suggestedthe Lo/Alter study could not be considered a confirmation it was his opinionthat: “The viruses discussed were somewhat different, but they really fell intofairly similar classification. It’s not important to get into the details ofviral taxonomy. It’s simply important to say that these were retroviruses thatwere related and they were distinctive in many ways.”17[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_649]Many but not all groups were unable to replicate these findings, but Lipkingenerously noted that none of them had the power to definitively refute thefindings, nor did they offer the investigators an opportunity to use their bestmethods to answer the question.“Almost two years ago with support from Francis Collins, director of the NIH,Anthony Fauci, director of the NIAID, Harold Varmus, director of the NCI, PeggyHamburg, commissioner of the FDA, we initiated a study to look into thisquestion in an absolutely clear cut fashion so I’m just going to talk about itvery briefly.”18 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_650]Lipkin acknowledged the clinical investigators: Anthony Komaroff out of Boston,Dan Peterson out of Nevada, Nancy Klimas out of Miami, Jose Montoya out of PaloAlto, Susan Levine from New York, and Lucinda Bateman from Salt Lake City:“They worked tirelessly to define the clinical criteria that would be used inthe study. We used Fukada criteria, the Canadian criteria, we tried to hedge thestudy in every which way so we could favor an infectious hypothesis if one werepresent.”19 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_651]Mikovits couldn’t help but grimace at what she felt to be a misleadingstatement. If they had wanted to “favor an infectious hypothesis” they obviouslywouldn’t have kicked out those patients with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, borreliaburgdorferi infection, or those with a “medical or psychiatric illness thatmight be associated with fatigue.” The condition was called “chronic fatiguesyndrome,” yet they were excluding one of three words in the title, leaving only“chronic” and “syndrome”—a nebulous description at best.Lipkin continued with his presentation: “And the laboratories, the efforts wereled by Shyh-Ching Lo at the FDA, Harvey Alter, Judy Mikovits and Frank Ruscettihere on the podium, Bill Switzer at the Centers for Disease Control, and MaureenHanson of Cornell University who can’t be with us today. The result of thegenetics test were chiefly PCR and people used whatever methods they wanted touse, found no evidence of XMRV or related viruses in either the subjects withchronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis or the controls.”20[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_652]Then Lipkin made a concession, keeping information in the study that wentagainst that thesis that mouse leukemia viruses weren’t causing problems in thehuman population, although he tried to scuttle past it as quickly as possible:“There was in fact a finding of some antibody responses, we don’t really knowwhat that means, in about six percent of the controls and six percent of theexperimental subjects. I don’t mean experimental subjects, excuse me, butsubjects with disease. But again, there was no association between the presenceof those antibodies and disease. And we really don’t know the validity of thoseparticular tests because we don’t have positive controls here with which towork” [emphasis added].21 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_653]When he said of patients, “I don’t mean experimental subjects, excuse me, butsubjects with disease,” it almost seemed like a Freudian slip, since he hadexcluded so many “subjects with disease” and “experimental subjects” soundedvaguely dehumanizing.Lipkin had also skated past the troubling information that somewhere aroundtwenty million Americans had abnormal antibodies to proteins, which were closelyrelated to those from a mouse leukemia retrovirus.Along the way Lipkin would dazzle them with the nice shiny promise ofcutting-edge science: “Many in the patient community have written me over thepast twelve hours since there have been leaks about the press release andfindings of the paper with dismay. With concern that this meant the end ofME/CFS research. Nothing could be further from the truth. Everybody here at thispodium, scientists around the world are committed to solving this problem. It islikely to be a constellation of disorders, not necessarily a single agent, be itviral, bacterial, or otherwise.“The samples that were collected during the course of this project will be anextraordinary resource for addressing questions related to the causes, thetreatment, the management, the pathogenesis, the basic science of thesedisorders.“And these samples have been collected, they’ve been stored in ultra-lowfreezers, they will be released to qualified investigators who make applicationthrough the NIH. I’m also informed that there are at least three active grantopportunities that will allow people to study these materials. So this has beena highly leveraged study.”22 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_654]Lipkin next turned to the investigators themselves and it was here that Mikovitswas most surprised. He was trying to restore her reputation, and although shedoubted it would make even a ripple among the professional community, she wasgrateful: “The other thing I want to say is that it took extraordinary courageon the part of Drs. Alter, Mikovits, and Ruscetti to participate in this study.To see it through to conclusion. To actually say, we now believe based on thedata we obtained that this first report may have been misleading. They too arecommitted to working on this problem, on this challenge.“And I can say in all my years of doing science I cannot think of a singleinstance where an investigator came back, went through this sort of process, andstood up and said, I want to be counted. I want to admit we made an error here,but I’m committed to moving forward and being public and forthright with thatscience.“I’m going to read one quote from Judy Mikovits which I think is representativeof what many people say, who participated in this study. ‘I greatly appreciatedthe opportunity to fully participate in this unprecedented study, unprecedentedbecause of the level of collaboration, the integrity of the investigators andthe commitment of the National Institutes of Health to provide its considerableresources to the CFS community for this important study. Although I amdisappointed we found no association of XMRV/pMLVs with CFS, the silver liningis that our 2009 Science report resulted in global awareness of this cripplingdisease and has sparked new interest in this research. I am dedicated tocontinuing to work with leaders in the field of pathogen discovery in the effortto determine the etiologic agent for CFS.’”23[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_655]Lipkin then turned to his left to directly face Mikovits and said, “Judy, Ithink that was extraordinary. And I applaud you for it.” Lipkin began to clap,then looked to the audience and nodded as the cue for them to clap as well.There was a light ripple of applause and Lipkin opened the floor for questions.* * *Journalist Hillary Johnson was the first to pipe up. Because she suffered fromME/CFS, she spoke with labored breath: “Dr. Lipkin, these patients have tendedto be very ill for many years, even decades, some of them, and there’s been alot of evidence for infection over the years. Might there not potentially beretroviral infection in tissue other than blood, such as spleen, liver, thyroid,lymph nodes, lymphoid tissues, etc.? Is that out of the question to be exploredin the future?”24 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_656]Johnson and Mikovits had developed a close relationship over the past few yearsand Johnson understood better than most outside journalists the unansweredquestions of this research. The reason Mikovits had taken multiple patientsamples over several months was exactly because of the concern expressed byHillary. Mikovits thought that evidence of the virus in the blood might wax andwane over time, so it was only by testing several samples from the sameindividual over a period of time you could positively rule out infection.Lipkin answered: “In science and medicine, you can never say never. That’s partof the nature of what we do. The question of course is when you put a study likethis in operation you’re testing work that has been previously reported. And inthe initial report, the findings were in blood. So, where would one stop?“You could survey potentially the entire body. And then you could make theargument that this was not one of those individuals, we need to do anotherhundred and so forth. So what we try and do in designing studies to look at thelikelihood of an association with a disease is to examine the first paper, whichcame out to describe the finding, to make certain to at least replicate it witha fair margin. And that’s the approach we took. But you’re correct. I cannot saythere is no person anywhere in the world who is not infected with a retrovirusin some organ that we have not sampled. But I don’t see any way in which we canformally and practically test that hypothesis.”25[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_657]Well, actually, Mikovits had already shown the way to “formally and practicallytest that hypothesis,” by including patients with medical fatigue, thyroidproblems, and infections, and by looking in her original study for abnormalnatural killer cell presentations, elevated levels of inflammatory markers forcytokines and chemokines, and positive results for antibodies to thespleen-focus forming virus test. The way to “test that hypothesis” was fairlysimple: include genuine patients in the study group instead of stand-ins.Mikovits hadn’t excluded patients due to coinfections with hepatitis B or C,treponema pallidium, borrelia burgdorferi, whether they had a medical orpsychiatric illness that might be associated with fatigue, or abnormalcharacteristics in their blood, or problems with thyroid functions. She had beenprepared to really hunt, taking a targeted and not a scattershot approach.After Harvey Alter made a few comments, Lipkin had some additional things hewanted to say: “In addition, there are people who will be using immunologicalmethods, this is not work we would do, but others have already proposed it, thatwould get at questions of serology.“And whether or not there’s previous infection and immune responses that supportthat hypothesis. There’s an independent effort, we have some three hundredsamples that will be studied using this approach, a hundred and fifty frompatients and a hundred and fifty from controls. A bit less, but that’s roughlywhere we are. That’s under the auspices of the Hutchins Family Foundation, whichhas an even larger cohort. And in addition to doing blood that group is alsogoing to be looking at meta-genomics. It’s going to look at fecal flora to seewhether there are some changes in the microbiome which might also be associatedwith disease.”26 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_658]Mikovits thought the last elements were good and even believed that looking atthe microbiome of the digestive tract of patients with CFS was a reasonableinvestigation. In fact, Maureen Hanson had written a beautiful grant proposal tostudy the gut microbiome with Ruth Ley in 2010, which was rejected twice, butultimately funded. If a mouse leukemia retrovirus was causing disturbances inthe immune system, the damage could logically originate in the gastrointestinalsystem. A large part of what happened in the immune system was determined bywhat took place in the gut so it was a sensible place to investigate.The next question came from Deborah Warnoff. At one point she’d noted that dueto the decreased lifespan of ME/CFS sufferers according to the governmenttables, she had about forty-five days left to live.After that grim statement, she asked: “Just to follow up in Hillary’s questionand what you just mentioned about the CFS initiative which will do flora. I’mjust wondering if there’s someplace where one can’t get in, and you’ve done somuch work compiling great cohorts for the CFA initiative and for this project.And with HIV a good deal of work was done with lymph glands and so forth. I justthink it would be very tempting since you could aspirate fairly readily, to goback and get lymph for all these people.“I’m a little surprised, although I’m not used to the confines of the scientificmethod, that you could resist the temptation to extract a bit of lymph as youwere going along. But since that was used in HIV, I just wonder if that wouldn’tbe a very tempting target?”27 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_659]Mikovits thought Warnoff was right on the money. The lymph glands were areservoir for HIV and samples were fairly easy to obtain compared to other organtissues.Lipkin responded: “Well, doing lymph node dissection is far more invasive thanphlebotomy, and once again, the objective here is to follow up on studies thatwere based on analysis of blood. And the findings in those studies were sorobust, that when we used, I think, was it Mady, three times as many subjects aswe thought we needed to confirm the results in that study, we felt that we werepowering it sufficiently, and adequately, and rigorously test the validity ofthose first findings. Again, this is what I do for a living, we discoverviruses. So, we frequently use tissue samples and other samples and so forth.But the point of this study was to test the original findings.”28[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_660]In other words, Lipkin offered a big fat no to the woman who’d said she mighthave a month and a half to live. They weren’t going to be testing lymph tissuefor retroviruses, even though such an approach in AIDS had shown that lymph wasa reservoir for HIV (and lymph was relatively easy tissue to extract), soDeborah Warnoff had better pull out her bucket list for her remaining forty-fivedays, because nobody was going to aspirate her nodes.It fell to Harvey Alter to pull the curtain away and reveal what seemed to bethe opinion of most of the research community: “One has to resist the temptationto keep the murine retroviral hypothesis alive. What you’re suggesting is tosay, well, it all came out negative, but maybe it’s still true by doingsomething else. And I think rather you have to say, really, this study was quitedefinitive. And has basically excluded these agents as the cause of CFS. Andyet, this is the impetus for moving on to more extensive, deeper studies to findthe actual cause.”29 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_661]Quite definitive? Every time the door was cracked open around retroviraltheories for ME/CFS, patients felt the foreshadowing of the same door slammingshut.Even Elaine DeFreitas, the researcher who also published evidence of aretrovirus in ME/CFS in the early 1990s, told Hillary Johnson, “I could seemyself twenty years from now, when I’m a high school biology teacher and someonecalls and says, ‘Hey they just found a retrovirus in CFS.’ And maybe that’s howit will happen. And I know how I’ll feel—I’ll feel great.”30[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_662] But did there have to be decades oftreading old waters in between? Couldn’t someone aspirate a lymph node?Lipkin spent some additional time defending the study, but then made remarkableclaims: “Our first foray, if you call it that, into chronic fatigue syndrome wasback in the middle 1990s when a Japanese team said 50 percent of CFS in Japanwas due to Borna disease virus, a virus that we’d identified several yearsearlier. And when we went through this and were unable to find any link betweenBorna virus and this syndrome, the one thing that did impress me, was that therewas an enormous amount of immune-reactivity that appeared to be non-specific inthese individuals.“So at a time when people were saying this was a psychosomatic disorder, I said,two-thirds to three-quarters of these individuals whom we’ve studied havepolyclonal B cell activation. They’re sick. We don’t know why. But they’re sick.That’s really the take-home point.”31 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_663]Mikovits did have to agree the finding of polyclonal B cell activation wasrock-solid. The immune system of these individuals was way out of whack andneeded to be further studied. Mikovits didn’t care if they made the link now ortwenty years from now with a mouse leukemia related retrovirus, but patientslike Deborah Warnoff and Hillary Johnson needed therapies now.Yet it was precisely at junctures like this that Lipkin’s momentarily supportivewords seemed to carry the least weight with his fellow scientists. The researchcommunity had no trouble with his efforts to “un-discover” previous findings,but when he pointed out facts that might lead to progress against these diseaseshe was talking to a pretty rigid wall.Lipkin continued in this vein for several minutes and some of the otherinvestigators offered their opinions before the ideas expressed were summarizedby Mady Hornig, the director of Translational Medicine at Columbia: “There areclearly a host of questions that remain that we’re dedicated to pursuing alongwith other investigators. We know, as Ian alluded, that there appears to be atleast in a portion of patients with CFS, an immune-reactivity, differentialimmune profiles.“We don’t know what those mean, why they exist, we don’t know which subsets ofpatients may be most likely to have those sorts of indices. But with these sortsof study design, we’ve done such exquisite characterization of patients, we’vecontrolled for so many factors that could alter the infectious agents in thecatchment area, you know, age and sex, and all of those other factors, so wemight begin to pursue what the indices might be that may lead us to some of theetiologic factors.”32 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_664]The next question came again from Hillary Johnson and addressed sexism indisease investigation: “The origination of the discovery of XMRV was by, as youknow, Joe DeRisi and Silverman, and also a number of papers published in2008–2009 relating XMRVs to prostate cancers as well. Or associating it, notsaying it was the cause of it. Nor did the Mikovits or Ruscetti paper say it wasthe cause either.“My question is, why so much emphasis, so much urgency to retract the connectionbetween XMRV and CFS and there hasn’t been any calls for the retraction of theprostate cancer papers where XMRV and prostate cancer were associated?”33[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_665]Lipkin didn’t appear to want to discuss the issue. Hillary knew from herprevious conversations that Lipkin was appalled at the way Silverman, DeRisi,and Gannon had stuck their heads in the sand over this issue, but he wasavoiding public debate.Lipkin replied: “I think that’s an interesting question. I don’t see anydelicate way for us to address it, and it’s off-point. So, I’ll be happy to talkwith you about that off-line, but not on-line. Other questions?”34[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_666]The next question was from Deborah Warnoff again, and it concerned how thepatient community could speed up the pace of research for progress within herlifetime (despite the forty-five day statistical prognosis, she was hoping for afew more years). Lipkin’s reply sounded like a call to arms, but because of thevery nature of their disease, political activism to these patients was likeembarking on a space shuttle flight.Lipkin was calling for a crusade he knew would be difficult, if not impossible,to mount (as if patients had not already tried): “I’ve been involved with anumber of organizations that have been successful in promoting research. Themost successful of course was the HIV/AIDS community and thereafter the autismcommunity. And you know there have been others that have been more successfuland less successful.“There’s no question but that your political leadership will respond topressure. So, this may not be a very popular thing to say with everyone becauseat the National Institutes of Health we like to focus on basic science andapplied science without talking about specific diseases. But the fact remainsthat if you say there’s going to be a certain amount of work that’s going to befocused on a particular area, and you can focus it in that way, then people willwork in that area.”“So I would encourage you to try and motivate your colleagues, people with thisdisease, related diseases, and the families and loved ones, to requestadditional support in this area. This is what happened with autism and it made ahuge difference in the investment at the level of the NIH and even in the DOD.“Again, this is very difficult for people who have a chronic illness, which isdebilitating. It’s difficult to be aggressive in pursuing this level of support,but I think it’s what you can do.”35 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_667]Even Harvey Alter who had just seemed suddenly so intent about ditching themouse leukemia retrovirus theory seemed to get excited by the question of whatto do next in CFS research. Alter said: “I think what’s going to acceleratethings at this point is that there’s been a shift in thinking. To date it’s beenlooking at organisms, mostly viruses, as causes of this disease. And every onehas sort of petered out with further investigation.“But now I think we’re thinking of the uniqueness of the host. And why docertain people respond to common viruses in a different way? Why is there ahyper-response, to probably cytokine production, other things, released incertain patients in response to viruses that most people handle differently?”36[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_668]Mikovits, sitting quietly for the most part, thought the immune response didseem to be key. While the evidence from the spleen-focus forming antibody virustest showed that something similar to a mouse leukemia retrovirus was present inthree to six percent of the US population, the majority of these people werecontrolling it. But for how long, Mikovits wondered?Were these millions of people a ticking time-bomb of chronic disease as theirimmune systems underwent the changes associated with aging or otherenvironmental challenges? Was the scientific research community acting like theguy in the joke who jumped off the Empire State building and as he passed eachfloor called out, “Everything’s good so far!”37[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_669]There was some further discussion of how the immune system was acting abnormallyin these patients and then a question came in over the internet from MartinEnserink, one of the writers from the journal Science, who had penned thearticle False Positive with Jon Cohen.Enserink asked: “Can you explain why the many failed attempts to replicate your2009 study, the Coffin-Pathak paper about XMRV’s origins, and the Blood WorkingGroup’s study published in 2009 failed to convince you that your 2009 study waswrong? And what sets this new study apart?”38[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_670]The question seemed to annoy Lipkin and he spoke with a clipped tone in hisvoice. “I think we’ve already been over that ad nauseum. We’ve talked about thefact that the first study was not appropriately powered. We’ve talked about thefact that the other studies did not allow them to do exactly what they wanted todo and the way they wanted to do it. I don’t know that there’s anything else toadd to that.”39 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_671]Lipkin asked if Ruscetti or Mikovits had anything to add. They had nothing elseto say to Science.* * *The final question in the press conference came from Hillary Johnson: “What werethe good things that came from this work? And we’ve seen that XMRV is a chimeraas it’s been described, and isn’t this somewhat worrisome in that we’ve seen howrapidly XMRV can replicate in human cells? We saw what XMRV did in the Rhesusmacaques, and we’re still using MLV (mouse leukemia retroviruses) andgammaretrovirus research in creating recombinants and vaccine therapy. Has thiscaused people at NIH (National Institutes of Health) to be somewhat concernedand even alarmed at the fact that these recombinants can occur in a lab? Thatthere can be man-made chimera viruses?”40 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_672]Maybe it was because of the lateness of the meeting, or the fact that those withME/CFS who were present had exhausted their meager reserves of energy, but Dr.Lipkin’s response could have been the opening scene of a science fiction moviewhere the best intentions of scientists go horribly wrong: “There’s a termthat’s used to describe this. It’s called gain a function research. And it’scome up most recently in the context of H5N1, the work that was done inRotterdam and Wisconsin and Japan, and generating recombinant influenza virusesthat appear to have more virulence, more transmissibility in ferret models.“And this is an issue that’s being addressed by the scientific community. Thereis no clear pathway as of yet. It’s being developed at very high levels in factwithin the World Health Organization. So this is something because wheneveryou’re creating new viruses that have potential to infect humans there is anissue of how that should be addressed and how that should be contained.“I can tell you with respect to H5N1 in the same journal in which our work hasappeared, MBIO, there will be a series of reports at the end of this month thattackle this issue. And there will be people speaking for H5N1 recombinantresearch at various levels, people speaking vociferously against it, and peoplewho are in the middle who are talking about doing work of that sort under highlevel containment.“And all these different perspectives will be addressed, debated in MBIO, and Iencourage you to wait for that. It will be coming up in about a week’s time. Andthere will be a press release and I will probably be participating in that aswell, but it won’t be here.“But in any event that is with a disease that is acute. It’s something thatcauses disease very rapidly. But I think the same arguments, the same principlesare at play, whether you’re talking about something that causes acute or chronicillness.“And this is something that the scientific community and the community at largeis going to have to wrestle with and make decisions about.“Very good point.”41 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_673]Johnson was asking if the public at large should be worried about man-madechimera viruses that could replicate rapidly in human cells.And all he could say was, very good point?But while Lipkin admitted that this fear of “man-made chimera viruses” was a“very good question,” he was avoiding the central question at the heart of theME/CFS epidemic: what had started it all, beginning with the outbreak at the LosAngeles County Hospital in 1934–1935, and why was nobody interested in thequestion?* * *The Lipkin multi-center study would claim one more victim, Max Pfost, Mikovits’sloyal research assistant from the Whittemore Peterson Institute. The young manwho’d loved science so much, he’d had tattoos of DNA proteins being translated,veins blowing up with viruses coming out of them, immune cells and B cells, aswell as a Latin inscription which read res firma mitescere nescit (“a firmresolve is not easily broken”), would pay a heavy price.In the aftermath of her termination, Mikovits had made sure Pfost successfullytransferred to the University of Alberta, where he would be a PhD student underthe mentorship of of Dr. Andy Mason, a researcher who had also discovered amouse related virus which had jumped into humans, a betaretrovirus which waslinked to an autoimmune liver disease, primary biliary cirrhosis.Prior to starting work in Alberta, Pfost said he “talked with Andy when I got upthere and I said I know you accepted me before all this legal stuff happened andthis affidavit showed up and if you’re not comfortable with me being here,please tell me. But Mason said he’d be fine with it.”42[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_674]Pfost was generally satisfied with his time in Canada from January of 2012 untilthe Lipkin study came out in September of that year, but then things changed. Itwas his birthday week and he’d missed a couple days of school, but “the weekprior to that I was speaking with Andy about working on some type of scholarshipproposal for a study. He said you should look into some of these things and wecan work on that. And I’ll help get you set up, get you some more money forschool. So I was working on that at home while I was sick and he called me athome for a meeting, like a week after that.”43[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_675]When Pfost arrived, his key card didn’t work, just as on that morning he’darrived at the WPI after Mikovits had been fired. When he got in, he found thatthe “meeting” was a serious meeting, and they’d brought in a faculty advisor whotold Pfost he’d made no progress and that at this rate it would take him twelveyears to graduate. “And I found that really weird because I didn’t have a lot ofresults, but I did have results, but they were negative results. [Pfost had beenresearching subversive viruses.] So for me I was really surprised because theysaid I had nothing to show for it.”44 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_676]Pfost said, “They explained to me I needed to leave the program, so we’re goingto offer you $3,500, we’ll give you a couple days to think about it. If youdon’t take it, we’re going to do everything in our power to make it miserablefor you here and you’ll have to leave. I was blown away because I’m in a foreigncountry, it’s Canada, and I don’t have a support system in place, and I can’tjust pick up a job as I found out. You need a work permit. So I didn’t know whatto do. I’d already had to deal with this whole legal battle with theWhittemores, and watched how that played out, and to me I just didn’t want todeal with going up against the wall anymore. So I just said, okay fine, I’lltake the money and go home.”45 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_677]At the time Pfost was contacted in March of 2014 he was working for a boatcompany as a delivery parts driver, and sometimes being allowed to do electricalwork. Of his current coworkers he says, “It’s funny to listen to them bestressed out about things. They just have no idea. This is the most stress-freejob I’ve ever had in my life.”46 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_678]When asked what Pfost thought he’d learned from these events, he was bothphilosophical and pessimistic. “I always felt that in the end, science prevails.You have data, you put that data together, and if it’s irrefutable, then that’swhat you go with. And I’m learning that’s not the case. You can have good data,and now you’ve got all these big people at the top and they say ‘we don’t wantthat for our journal.’ Or, ‘they probably shouldn’t get any funding because Idon’t like the project they’re working on,’ or ‘it doesn’t make sense.’ So nowyour funding is cut and you can’t work. It’s tough. I want to get back into it.It’s probably taken me a while to realize that. But it feels like sciencedoesn’t want me back.”47 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach20fn_679]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-ONEThe Rediscovery of XMRV?The results suggest that xenograft approaches commonly used in the study ofhuman cancer promote the evolution of novel retroviruses with pathogenicproperties.1 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach21fn_680]—Dr. Vinay Pathak, in a paper released on March 27, 2013, showing that proteinsfrom the envelope of a mouseleukemia virus create larger cancerous tumors.We found retroviruses in 85 percent of the sample pools. Again, it is verydifficult to know whether or not this is clinically significant or not. Andgiven the previous experience with retroviruses in chronic fatigue, I am goingto be very clear in telling you, although I am reporting them in ProfessorMontoya’s samples, neither he, nor we, have concluded that there is arelationship to disease.2 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach21fn_681]—Dr. Ian Lipkin in a public conference call with the Centersfor Disease Control on September 10, 2013In 2009, Mikovits and her team reported finding evidence of XMRV in 67 percentof her ME/CFS patient cohort who also had diminished natural killer cellactivity and other markers of impaired immunity. In 2010 Drs. Shyh-Ching Lo andHarvey Alter reported 83 percent of their cohort of ME/CFS patients showedevidence of mouse leukemia retroviruses. In 2011, Drs. John Coffin and VinayPathak, suggested that XMRV or something very similar had arisen through thepassage of prostate cancer samples through mouse tissue between 1992–1994 atCase Western University in Ohio.By 2012, the first two papers had been retracted or their conclusions altered.What had caused the scientific switchback? The studies from the Blood WorkingGroup and Lipkin could not replicate Mikovits’s team’s original findings. In2013, Ruscetti re-derived the B cells lines from uncultured frozen materials andthey now contained no XMRV.* * *In 2012 Ian Lipkin, had to acknowledge the danger recombinant viruses created inlabs might pose. The mouse leukemia viruses and the theory of the possibleconnection to human disease was now considered dead, or as the journal Natureproclaimed of Lipkin in an article also released on September 18, 2012,entitled, “The Scientist Who Put the Nail in XMRV’s Coffin,”3[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach21fn_682] the situation had been “contained.”“Contained” seemed a more appropriate word for the lingering mystery. Scientistsdid not know what drove the abnormal immune response that even Lipkin hadadmitted witnessing in ME/CFS. The three positive studies reports usingMikovits’s antibody test for spleen-focus forming virus still needed to beexplained.Judy Mikovits might escape the “burning at the stake,” but the researchcommunity would do the next best thing and try to forget she had ever existed,effectively shunning her. Even the powerful support of Ian Lipkin could dolittle to bring her back to the field to which she had devoted her life.Lipkin’s powers seemed to be restricted to un-discovery of research, not theresurrection of researchers.The millions who suffered would have to make do with the promise of bright,shiny science in a hazy but amazing future to come, the same life raft they hadclung to for decades, rebranded in new packaging. Their salvation might arrivein the form of ultra-low freezers to maintain their samples, deep-sequencing,genomics, RNA profiles, immune system modulators, cytokine and chemokine tests,and investigating the micro-biome of their digestive tracts.These advances held promise, but where was the urgency, the fast-tracking, seenin other diseases? Nobody would look for the truth of what had happened in1934–1935 at Los Angeles County General Hospital and sickened nearly two hundreddoctors and nurses. Nobody would look for the truth of what happened to startthe modern epidemic of ME/CFS which began in 1984–1985 in Incline Village,Nevada, where it was first observed by Dan Peterson and Paul Cheney; and nobodywould ask why 1 in 50 children in the United States had autism, a condition thatwas unknown before its description in 1943 by Leo Kanner, the former RockefellerFoundation fellow.* * *On November 27, 2012, a glimmering curiosity of a paper was submitted to thejournal Retrovirology. It was unusual for a couple reasons.First, it was odd because of the subject matter, XMRV, when it was well-knownthat the editor in chief of Retrovirology, Kuan-Teh Jeang, did not believe inthe value of research involving the XMRV retrovirus, which his journal had leada vigorous campaign against for three years since he accepted it was simply alab creation and had shouted his virulent dismissal at the Leuvan conference inBelgium.Two months had passed since the publication of the Lipkin study and Naturemagazine’s identification of Lipkin as “The Man Who Put the Nail in XMRV’sCoffin.”4 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach21fn_683] But it seemed this pesky littlemouse-human retrovirus wouldn’t stay dead and buried: instead it reappeared withchurch-mouse-quiet in Retrovirology, heralding a rebirth. But then, in the awfulstyle of confounding cover-ups, a tragedy also unfolded.Kuan-Teh Jeang had recently delivered the October 24, 2012, George KhouryLecture at the NIH on cellular transformation by the human T cell leukemia virus(HTLV-1).5 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach21fn_684] On January 27, 2013, a Sundaynight, Teh, as he was called by his friends, chief of the Molecular VirologySection of the National Institute of Infection and Allergic Diseases Laboratoryof Molecular Microbiology, would go to his office and inexplicably kill himself.It is almost hard to reconcile his prior dismissal of XMRV with what several ofhis Asian-American scientific colleagues wrote in an admiring obituary when theysaid that Teh “always kept his curiosity alive and was ready to embraceserendipity.”6 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach21fn_685] He sounded, in thatdescription, like another potential ally stolen away.Whatever the cause of his suicide, the field of retrorivology looked more andmore like a crime scene, from the willful neglect of patients to institutionalneglect and malfeasance, to mug shots of innocent scientists in respectedjournals. The overt blood-throwing days of ACT-UP had gotten quieter, yet moreinsidious.The second curious thing about this Retrovirology paper was one of its authors,Vinay Pathak, who along with John Coffin had first promulgated the idea thatXMRV was an inadvertent lab creation made sometime between 1992–1994 at CaseWestern University and thus couldn’t be the cause of the modern outbreak ofME/CFS that began in 1984–1985. If XMRV was simply a lab creation, what was theinterest in studying it? But Pathak and his colleagues seemed very interested.As a Christian, Mikovits felt in her soul that God had placed her in the middleof this controversy for a reason, and her faith directed that if she held ontoher faith and acted with integrity, she might also understand why. Harvey’sactions may have been a long con, but she too felt that she was in the middle ofa longer, greater plan, and it would ultimately shake down to its pure meaning.The title of the Retrovirology paper was “Xenotropic MLV Envelope ProteinsInduce Tumor Cells to Secrete Factors that Promote the Formation of ImmatureBlood Vessels,” and it was published on March 27, 2013, two months to the dayafter Jeang’s suicide. In the background section of their paper the authorswrote:XMRV had first been identified in tissue from prostate cancer tumors and laterin the blood of patients with ME/CFS. Those findings were now in dispute, butmost parties agreed that the virus itself had evolved as the result of“retroviral combination events in human tumor cell lines established throughmurine xenograft events.”Simply stated, when human tissue passed through mouse tissue, some mouse virusescould recombine with human viruses to form new viruses.In the results section of their paper, Pathak and his colleagues observed thatwhen XMRV was injected into mice that had existing tumors, the virus suppressedthe differentiation of blood vessels, leading to larger tumors. In theconclusions section they wrote:Although it is highly unlikely that either XMRV or B4Rv themselves infect humansand are pathogenic, the results suggest that xenograft approaches commonly usedin the study of human cancer promote the evolution of novel retroviruses withpathogenic properties.7 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach21fn_686]Mikovits read the line, “promote the evolution of novel retroviruses withpathogenic properties,” and wanted to cry out, “that’s what I’ve been saying!”It brought her immediately back to the November 2006 Human Herpes Virus 6(HHV-6) meeting in Barcelona, Spain, where she’d rushed the stage after thepresentation of Dan Peterson showing his ME/CFS with cancers had an abnormalT-cells populations.To Mikovits, the data looked like the footprint of an immune-altering retrovirusjust as she said to Gary Owens in Cleveland November 10, 2009, when he daredcall B4rv, XMRV2. Indeed, the 2013 paper in Retrovirology (that Dr. Owens was asa coauthor on the Pathak paper) reported, that “Phylogenetic tree analysesdemonstrated that while B4rv and XMRV share greater similarity to one anotherthan other MLVs, B4rv represents a distinct sequence from that of XMRV (Figure1D). Together, these data show that B4rv is a xenotropic MLV found in a humancell line derived through xenograft experiments in nude mice that is distinct insequence and proviral origin from XMRV.”8 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach21fn_687]Mikovits had entered the ME/CFS field because of the elevated rate of certainrare types of cancer among the patients, one a doctor who treated ME/CFS haddied of just such a highly vascularized and aggressive tumor shortly after shedetected high levels of env protein in his blood. Now Pathak and Owens showedthe envelope proteins of that very virus and its related family members couldindeed promote cancer formation.The mouse leukemia related viruses and the diseases they might cause among thehuman population were not quite dead. Vasculitis in mice could be caused by XMRVor B4RV but somehow—despite this fairly damning finding—they concluded thatvaculitis in humans could not be?The place from which these viruses had mutated, the course of their evolutionand the path, which had led them from mice to humans, were still obviouslyunmapped regions that needed to be explored.* * *An article published in the journal PLOS ONE on March 13, 2013, from researchersat the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine about the reversalof autism in a mouse model of the disorder prompted new theories about whatmight be behind autism and other neuroimmune diseases, including ME/CFS.The approach was called antipurinergic therapy, or APT, and it was based on thetheory that cells got stuck in a defensive mode as they suspected some type ofinvader. In this immune-activated state the cells failed to communicate witheach other. The lead researcher was Robert Naviaux, MD, PhD, professor ofmedicine and co-director of the Mitochondrial and Metabolic Disease Center at UCSan Diego. Mikovits wondered if he would shortly find himself in trouble orwhether he might more successfully navigate the treacherous waters ofneuroimmune diseases.From an article on Science Daily on March 13, 2013, discussing the findings:“When cells are exposed to classical forms of danger, such as a virus, infectionor toxic environmental substances, a defense mechanism is activated,” Naviauxexplained. “This results in changes to metabolism and gene expression, andreduces the communication between neighboring cells. Simply put, when cells stoptalking to each other, children stop talking . . .”9[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach21fn_688]When Mikovits read the article she smiled. She had worked with suramin back inthe late 1980s in prostate cancer, looking for treatment for her stepfather.It was not effective against prostate cancer, but maybe that was because theprocess was too far along. Could suramin be effective earlier, used at lowerdoses to prevent the development of cancer? She also had concerns aboutlong-term use of the drug, but there were other compounds that might do the samething.Mikovits noted the elegant, smooth, and politically inoffensive way the leadresearcher, Naviaux had framed the issue, “When cells are exposed to classicalforms of danger, such as a virus, infection or toxic environmental substances, adefense mechanism is activated.”10 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach21fn_689]That covered a lot of ground.It also allowed people to skip over the messy middle of what had activated thisdefense mechanism (such as a retrovirus) and concentrate on bringing relief topatients.11 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach21fn_690]* * *Ian Lipkin held a public conference call on September 10, 2013, with the Centersfor Disease Control. The subject was his latest research on ME/CFS patients.Lipkin said:So, again, there seems to be a significant difference in profiles obtained frompeople who have had the disease for less than three years and people who havehad the disease for more than three years.In what I would call the “Early Group,” which is less than three years, thereseems to be a number of markers suggestive of some sort of allergy aspect. Theyhave increased numbers, typically, of eosinophils in blood, and when we examinetheir markers from areas, cytokines—we find there are definite differences. I’mnot going to talk a great deal about the differences between before three yearsand after three years, because we are still working on this.Lipkin then entered into what he hoped would be the main point of his talk andthe take-away from his findings, namely that they had identified a pattern ofinflammatory markers that were unique for ME/CFS.So, I will confine my discussion to a number of cytokines and chemokines thatare up or down in people who have disease, and again, this is important becauseI think that we may find that there are drugs which can be used to modulate thelevels of cytokines; and while these may not get at the cause of this disease,the primary cause which I still believe is likely to be an infectious agent, itmay give us some insight in ways in which we can manage and decrease some of thedisabilities associated with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.12[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach21fn_691]It was an abnormal pattern of cytokines and chemokines and her dedication todevelopment of therapeutic strategies to modulate cytokines that had first ledMikovits to conclude that a retrovirus might lie at the heart of the disorder.And then Lipkin reported a retroviral finding which was just as robust as theones Mikovits and the Lo/Alter group had described, but it didn’t seem he wantedto spend much time discussing the implications:We found retroviruses in 85 percent of the sample pools. Again, it is verydifficult at this point to know whether or not this is clinically significant ornot, and given the previous experience with retroviruses in chronic fatigue, Iam going to be very clear in telling you, although I am reporting this atpresent in Professor Montoya’s samples, neither he nor we have concluded thatthere is a relationship to disease.13 [../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach21fn_692]When Ruscetti heard this he was apoplectic: “What gives Lipkin the right todecide that retroviral sequences which Coffin had been finding since the 1980shad no relationship to disease?” Ruscetti screamed. It was nothing but politicalexpediency.The “stealth” nature of retroviruses was well known, so if they were reallydoing any kind of virus hunting, they wouldn’t be looking only for buffalo on anopen plain. A study published in November 2013 in Nature found, interestingly,that HIV uses an “invisibility cloak” made up of the body’s own cells to evadedetection.As reported by Andrew Naughtie in The Conversation, “HIV uses molecules insidehost cells in an infected person to avoid alerting the body’s innate immunesystem (IIS)—cells and mechanisms that form the first line of defense in ourbodies—to its presence. By using the host’s own cells to hide, the virus is ableto replicate in the body undisturbed.The team was able to identify how the HIV virus used this cloaking tactic, andwas then able to look at how the viral invader might be uncloaked.”14[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach21fn_693]Ruscetti wondered what it would take for someone to “uncloak” the potential roleof retroviruses in neuroimmune disease. Just about everyone agreed that tamingthe cytokine/chemokine storm in ME/CFS patients was probably an important pieceof treating the disorder, just as 2010 was dubbed “the year of inflammation” byresearchers at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections thatfocused heavily on the role of inflammation in AIDS.15[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach21fn_694]But why were they running from the retrovirus in ME/CFS, if a “year ofinflammation” could swirl around AIDS and inflammatory markers were clearlynoted in ME/CFS? Something was causing the cytokine/chemokine storm. Didn’t theywant to know what? They were like meteorologists not wanting to figure out whytornadoes spin.* * *When Mikovits later reflected on all that had taken place in the XMRVinvestigation she couldn’t help but think that her troubles stemmed not frombeing the first to consider new ideas, but the first to take them to publicforums and discuss their broader public health implications. There was clearevidence that others had pondered the same ideas: chief among them were her mostprominent detractors, John Coffin and Jonathan Stoye.In 1995 the two of them had in fact collaborated on a Letter to the Editor ofNature Medicine entitled “The Dangers of Xenotransplantation.”16[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach21fn_695] Xenotransplantation refers to the growingof tissue of human organ tissue in an animal, then transplanting that organ intoa human being. Both Coffin and Stoye were deeply concerned about the possibledangers of such a procedure being done on a regular basis.Their concerns about the risks of xenotransplantation would mirror the fearsMikovits would later express about whether the passaging of human tissue throughmice and possibly other animals in the early days of vaccine development hadresulted in just such a catastrophe.In the 1995 letter, Coffin and Stoye wrote that despite the recent enthusiasmfor xenotransplantation, they had significant concerns. What about viruses,which might be contained in these tissues? They wrote:The pathogenicity of these viruses has not been studied. However, since growthof related viruses in immunosuppressed hosts can lead to tumor development, thisprospect is somewhat alarming.We suggest that strenuous efforts be made to identify or breed virus-negativedonors and that all protocols for xenotransplantation include specific steps tomonitor human recipients for possible infection by retrovirus of donor origin.17[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach21fn_696]Science does have the full capacity for reflection, wisdom, and discretion, andin their campaign against xenograft transplants Coffin and Stoye displayedadmirable insight. Viruses, which had adapted themselves to live in mammalsmight become especially virulent when transplanted into humans.The fact that the organ transplant recipients would in all likelihood beimmune-suppressed as a result of the operation itself, and the immunosuppressantdrugs typically given after a transplant, raised the possibility that evenrelatively harmless viruses might cause extensive harm to such individuals.If Coffin and Stoye were correct in their concerns about the potential forunknown viruses to cross into humans as a result of human organs grown in animaltissue, it’s difficult to see much of a distinction between these notions oforgan transplants, and vaccines prepared in animal cultures (such as mice), andthen injected into people.Infants would likely be at special risk for such viruses as their immune systemsare still developing and might react in unexpected way to such a challenge. Thesame might be said of the ME/CFS patients, some of whom worked in high-pressurejobs or were extreme athletes and could have put their bodies through novelstressors, others who may have had prior immunosuppression from another factor.But the question remains whether science is willing to look at its own pastpractices and exhume those that people like Coffin have tried to bury. Thequestion is in many ways a philosophical one, whether any powerful group shouldbe “self-policing” without significant oversight from independent bodies. Fromthose who have endured the abuse of members of the clergy, to the recklessbehavior of large financial institutions, it seems that groups whose ambitionsand plans are not periodically challenged often find themselves committingmistakes of devastating proportions. And while industrialized nations no longerhave the epidemics of polio or yellow fever ravaging their populations, thereare other, quieter plagues.Conservative estimates of ME/CFS in our country are more than a millionindividuals, and autism affects 1 in 50 children. At its height polio affectedno more than 1 in 2,000 children, most of whom ultimately recovered, and forthat there was a widespread social outcry for a cure. ME/CFS, autism, and otherneuroimmune diseases are lingering afflictions, persisting for decades andlifetimes with incurable devastation.These are not ancient diseases, but relatively new denizens of our planet. Wehave not seen similar outbreaks before. One wonders if the physical plague ofthese desperately sick individuals is not matched by an equally deadly spiritualplague among the scientific community that dissuades scientists from having adirect, empathic relationship with patients.The larger question is whether the plague feared by Coffin and Stoye has alreadyarrived, whether we fail to see the clever virus which does not kill its host,but has learned to live with it. When a disease takes so much from a patient,but stops just short of death, how does the medical community respond?And will the scientific community have the courage to answer the question ofwhether these diseases might be the result of their own creation? Or will thosewho suffer have to do what one brave patient ME/CFS did, setting up a mattressin a public space and lying on it in protest, until someone adequately responds?The final stunning paper in the possible resurrection of the xenotropic murineviruses playing roles in human disease was published by Coffin and Pathak inNovember 2013. It is entitled “Generation of Multiple Replication-CompetentRetroviruses through Recombination between PreXMRV-1 and PreXMRV-2.” Theabstract read like the nightmare scenario of some science fiction movie, showingthat what scientists had believed to be benign, carried terrifying risks. In theexperiment they put two endogenous mouse leukemia proviruses, preXMRV-1 andPreXMRV-2 in culture, and waited to see what happened. They found:the presence of reverse transcriptase activity at 10 days postinfectionindicated the presence of RCRs [retroviruses that can replicate]. Populationsequencing of proviral DNA indicated that all RCRs contained the gag and 5’ halfof pol from PreXMRV-2 and the long terminal repeat, 3’ half of pol (includingintegrase), and env from PreXMRV-1.It had taken 10 days to create a new retrovirus in those conditions. And whatabout all the other xenotropic murine leukemia virus relatedreplication-competent retroviruses that might have been generated by thisrecombination experiment, beyond the dismissed XMRV?Could they cause a natural history of infection in humans? Could they relate toLo and Alter’s findings of variant MLVs? There is no evidence of a naturalhistory of infection in humans by these viruses as of yet. However, it wouldhave taken and will still take only one. Mikovits’s question to Coffin in Ottawatakes on more prescient meaning “How many new recombinant retroviruses have wecreated?”Ruscetti thinks that this recombination experiment should be done in human cellsexpressing human endogenous viruses like HERV K.XMRV can cause pathogenic changes in mice. Lipkin found retroviral sequences in85 percent of ME/CFS patients; and Coffin generated novel replication competentretroviruses related to XMRV in ten days.In February of 2014 the American Society for Microbiology published an articleon the effectiveness of alcohol-based disinfectants to prevent XMRVcontamination. The concluding sentence of their abstract states, “Theirapplications will help to prevent unintended XMRV contamination of cell culturesin laboratories and minimize the risk for laboratory personnel and healthcareworkers to become infected with this biosafety level 2 organism.”18[../Text/031_Notes.html#Ach21fn_697] (italics added) In the article’s concernabout the risk to healthcare workers, one can almost hear the echoes of theoriginal 1934–1935 outbreak of ME/CFS among the doctors and nurses of LosAngeles County General Hospital.As for Mikovits, she is like her former research assistant, Max Pfost, a personthat science does not seem to want. The legal battles with the Whittemores lefther financially devastated, and the research grants, which would have enabledher to continue her investigations at another institution were taken away fromher. She still has not received copies of her notebooks or those of the team sheled at the WPI for nearly five years. It as if Darwin, having sailed around theworld for five years on the Beagle, collecting his samples and making his notes,published his theory of evolution, only to have the Church of England swoop inand take all of his materials away, then feign surprise that he couldn’t keepworking on his theory. One can only speculate why those in positions of power inscience have not demanded that her notebooks be returned.And yet Mikovits continues to go to conferences and follow the latest scientificresearch. She has formed a company with Frank Ruscetti, MAR Consulting Inc., sothat they can consult with physicians, patients, companies, and academicinstitutions. For Mikovits, it has always been and will always be about thepatients.Mikovits wonders whether science will continue to dismiss and dehumanize thepatients, severing those unmistakable connections, and not following hopefulleads. Or will the NIH and other government agencies finally welcome the greatinsights of patients and researchers?The question, which Mikovits continues to ask, the question, which urgentlyneeds to be answered, is whether the plague feared by Coffin and Stoye hasalready arrived, but we do not recognize it. As Mikovits and Ruscetti have oftensaid to each other over the years: they see what they want to see, and that isthe real plague."},{"pageContent":"AcknowledgmentsKent HeckenlivelyI’d like to thank my lovely wife and partner in life, Linda, my son and firstreader, Ben, and my daughter, Jacqueline, who shows me on a daily basis themeaning of courage.I’d also like to thank my father, who has always supported my efforts and mydear deceased mother who taught me that if a cause is just you fight no matterthe size of your enemy.
