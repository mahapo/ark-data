Proponents declare that vaccines havesaved millions of lives, while critics claim that their success has beenoverstated and that vaccines may even be dangerous for some people. Manyconsider mandatory vaccinations a violation of individual rights or religiousprinciples. Many in public health argue that vaccine mandates are justified andthat anti-vaccination sentiment has reduced uptake rates in certain communities,resulting in outbreaks of preventable, and sometimes fatal, childhood illnesses.Opponents of vaccination point out that serious “vaccine preventable diseases”declined in severity and frequency before mass vaccination commenced due tobetter living conditions and the effectiveness of modern sanitation engineering.The reality of vaccine injury has been horribly mishandled by the medicalestablishment for two hundred years, as we shall show. Denial, secrecy, andpersecution of those who raise concerns about vaccine safety continue to thisday. Are vaccines really safe and effective? Are the successes overstated? Areother public health initiatives more effective? Are vaccines acceptable topeople with unique religious traditions? Are they contaminated? Do theysometimes spread the diseases they seek to prevent? Are they being over-used,and are severe diseases being replaced by vaccine-induced chronic diseases andconditions?The fact is that vaccine injuries have happened in the past and continue tohappen today. Even though reliance on vaccines has increased, mainstreammedicine has never fully and transparently addressed the reality of vaccineinjury. We must recognize that vaccines are drugs, and the more drugs one takes,the more numerous the adverse reactions to those drugs will be.In the 1980s the United States addressed individual cases of vaccine injury byestablishing the NVICP—the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program—acontroversial Department of Health and Human Resources program. The NVICP wasintended to be “non-adversarial, compassionate and generous” to vaccine injuryvictims. However, as we write this book, Congress is considering hearings on theeffectiveness of the NVICP. Many vaccine injury victims and vaccine safetyadvocates believe that the program is not functioning as Congress intended. Theconcern is that the NVICP is not an open and fair justice forum. There are alsoconcerns that the program is keeping the reality of vaccine injury away frompublic inspection. While some (but perhaps not all) case decisions are posted onthe United States Court of Claims website, most people don’t know that the NVICPeven exists.We intend to publish Vaccine Injuries annually. Each year’s book will featureall of the reported case decisions, by filing date, that resulted in thedecision to compensate. While we have edited these cases for readability, wefeel that these reported decisions, which may be referenced for legal purposes,provide an invaluable insight into the nature of vaccine injury and how theNVICP actually works. These case decisions are not easy reading. Vaccine injurycan result in death and suffering. As these are public documents and petitionershave the right to file motions to redact personal information before the casesare posted, we have not removed case names. However, we ask the reader torespect the privacy of the litigants, their doctors, and expert witnesses.We will also publish a sampling of unreported compensated cases. These cases,while public, are not reference material for legal purposes. Publishing all ofthe compensated cases of vaccine injury in the unreported section of the websitewould be excessive.To place the current cases in context and to shed light on how the NVICP hasevolved, we will also feature selected historical decisions.The vast majority of cases filed in the NVICP do not result in compensation, asthe 2013 statistical report shows.Historically, the majority of claims have been filed for varieties of diptheria,pertussis, and tetanus and varieties of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines.Most of these claims involved children whose alleged injuries were seizures andbrain damage (encephalopathy). At the present time, the majority of casescompensated by the NVICP feature neurological injury to adults, such asGuillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), from adverse reactions to various influenzavaccines. Of the 993 NVICP cases reported for 2013, 627 were dismissed and 366were compensated. Petitioner award amounts totaled $254,666,326.70. Since 1988,3,540 individuals have been compensated and $2,671,223,269.97 has been paid outto victims of vaccine injury.1 [../Text/026_Notes.html#Afn_1]For those who have accepted the oft-repeated claim that vaccines are safe andeffective, these numbers may be shocking. However, it is critical to note thatthese statistics do not reflect the fact that the vast majority of vaccineinjuries are not even reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System(VAERS) and that the vast majority of suspected injuries never result in NVICPfilings.2 [../Text/026_Notes.html#Afn_2]The statute of limitations for filing vaccine injury claims in the NVICP isthree years. It is critical that those who claim vaccine injury have informationat their fingertips so that they can act promptly.We do not list attorney names—petitioner or respondent—in any of the cases, aswe are not dispensing legal advice or providing advertising for attorneys. Bewarned, however, that the burdens of acting pro se—on behalf of your self—in theNVICP are not to be underestimated. A list of the attorneys admitted to the barof the program is available through the US Court of Claims website.3[../Text/026_Notes.html#Afn_3] Another good resource is the National VaccineInformation Center (NVIC), which also features a listing of attorneys and othervaluable information.We recognize that many will describe this book as “anti-vaccine”—a sophisticargument. Federal aviation officials who investigate airplane accidents are not“anti-air travel.” Aviation accidents result in notifications to pilots thatexplain the implications of these accidents. Consumers of vaccines deserve noless. Vaccines are drugs, and adverse drug reactions happen. Publicly disclosingthem—as is often done on television drug commercials—allows consumers to makeinformed choices. Analyzing adverse drug reactions leads to safer drugs. This isour intention here.Publication of compensated vaccine injury cases from the NVICP—something thathas never been offered to the public—will allow the reader to assess vaccineinjury. We hope our book serves as a jumping-off point for the reader’sinvestigation and analysis. We hope that the information provided here will leadto family discussions about vaccines and vaccine safety. We believe in informedconsent and that individuals and parents, on behalf of their children, ought tohave the final decision on medical choices."},{"pageContent":"2A BRIEF HISTORY OF VACCINATIONIt is important to acknowledge the devastation of disease outbreaks throughouthuman history. Smallpox killed an estimated three hundred to five hundredmillion people before the last recorded case in 1979. Typhoid fever, scarletfever, whooping cough, diptheria, tuberculosis, and even diarrhea killed untoldmillions. Europe lingered in the Dark Ages for hundreds of years in no smallpart due to the Black Death, which killed anywhere between seventy-five and twohundred million.Disease forever altered history in the Americas as well. Hidden Cities authorRoger Kennedy claims that North America’s pre-Columbian civilization disappearedin what he termed “the Great Dying”—a plague that claimed an estimated thirtymillion lives due to the arrival of microbes from unknown pre-Columbian Europeanvisitors.1 [../Text/026_Notes.html#Afn2_1] The early American historicalperspective of “an open continent” was possible only because the vast majorityof indigenous people had been wiped out.It wasn’t Hernando Cortez who defeated the Aztecs. It was smallpox,inadvertently transmitted by the conquistadors, that devastated the Aztecempire. Malaria has killed untold millions in Africa, Asia, and South America.Disease has had catastrophic impacts on civilization.The Romans suspected the importance of clean running water and personal hygiene.The Romans, like many in the ancient world, believed that “badair”—miasma—caused disease. They designed their cities with this belief in mind.Aqueducts, sewers, and public baths were the response. It has been theorizedthat the fall of Rome—and the loss of Roman engineering—set the stage for thescourge of disease in the Western world.It is not known when attempts to improve human immunity began, but it isbelieved that inoculation—often referred to as variolation—originated ineighth-century India. The practice involved taking exudates from a personinfected with a mild case of smallpox and rubbing it into a cut on the skin of anon-infected person. The person receiving the treatment would become ill butwould develop immunity to the more serious version of the disease.Inoculation was considered by the British Royal Society in 1699 and discussed inthe society’s Philosophical Transactions in 1714 and 1716. After observing theinoculation in Turkey, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu became a champion for thetechnique in 1718—by publicly inoculating her children. A few years later,Edward Jenner would make the practice safer by inoculating his children withcowpox in order to protect people against smallpox.In the new world, devastating smallpox outbreaks occurred throughout the 1600sand 1700s in New England. In Boston, the sick were often held under armed guardin “pest houses.” The smallpox mortality rate for New Englanders was near 30percent.The Reverend Cotton Mather was inoculation’s first American proponent when helearned of variolation from an African slave. Mather advocated for the practiceduring the smallpox outbreak of 1721. Mather publicly debated the issue withWilliam Douglas, Boston’s only trained university physician. Douglas argued thatinoculation—which involved direct transfers of bodily fluids—could spreadsmallpox that resulted in fatalities and could also spread other diseases aswell, such as syphilis. These were valid criticisms of the primitive state ofthe technique. Douglas also felt that Mather was undermining medical authorityby carrying out inoculations in haphazard fashion.Mather, who lost his wife and children in a measles outbreak, regardedinoculations as a gift from God. Many, however, felt that the technique was anattempt to subvert the will of God and regarded it as a heathen practice. In his1722 sermon entitled “The Dangerous and Sinful Practice of Inoculation,” Englishtheologian Reverend Edmund Massey argued that diseases are sent by God to punishsin and that any attempt to prevent smallpox via inoculation is a “diabolicaloperation.”The debate was heated. Mather’s house was firebombed, apparently in response tohis support for inoculation. Mather ultimately convinced Dr. Zabdiel Boylston toexperiment with variolation. Boylston experimented on his six-year-old son, hisslave, and his slave’s son. Both contracted the disease and became “gravely ill”for several days before recovering. Boylston went on to inoculate thousands inMassachusetts.2 [../Text/026_Notes.html#Afn2_2]Ultimately, inoculation became more accepted through the work of Edward Jenner,who noted that English milk maids didn’t seem to contract smallpox and theorizedthat this was because they contracted non-lethal cowpox from milking cows.Jenner pioneered a new type of inoculation called “vaccination”—a word derivedfrom the Latin word for cow—vacca. Jenner took cowpox virus from a cow andinjected it into humans, the result being immunity from smallpox. Eventually,vaccination was embraced, and in 1840, the British government providedvaccination free of charge. Variolation was replaced by vaccination andultimately banned. Jenner became known as the “father of immunology.”Many of America’s founding fathers supported inoculation and, subsequently,vaccination. Benjamin Franklin’s advocacy of inoculation was driven by the deathof his son, Frankie, apparently due to smallpox. There were also rumors thatFrankie died from an adverse reaction—protracted diarrhea—to inoculation.3[../Text/026_Notes.html#Afn2_3] Franklin denied this rumor and publiclysupported inoculation.John and Abigail Adams were also proponents. John Adams suffered a horribletwo-week illness after being inoculated. Abigail also suffered an adversereaction.Inoculation was rough business. People in colonial America understood that theprocedure often included adverse reactions, injury, and even death. Thewillingness to take the risks involved in early inoculation had to be weighedagainst the scourge of smallpox. Desperate times meant desperate measures.Smallpox inoculation efforts triggered riots in Norfolk County, Virginia. ThomasJefferson, then a young lawyer, defended the victims of the Norfolk riots,including a Dr. Archibald Campbell, whose house was burned down. Ultimately, itwas Thomas Jefferson who became vaccination’s biggest American advocate.Jefferson, who corresponded with Edward Jenner, was greatly influenced byHarvard’s Benjamin Waterhouse, one of New England’s only European-traineddoctors. Waterhouse is largely regarded as the man who championed earlyvaccination in the United States.Jefferson was, to put it mildly, distrustful of American doctors, remarking that“whenever he saw three physicians together he looked up to discover whetherthere was not a turkey buzzard in the neighborhood.”4[../Text/026_Notes.html#Afn2_4] Jefferson was enamored with Waterhouse due tohis European scientific training. Working with Waterhouse, Jefferson dispatchedsmallpox vaccines to southern cities only to find that the vaccines didn’t work.Vaccine antigens were transported on pieces of cotton thread. They often failedto work because the antigen lost effectiveness. Jefferson realized that thevaccines had gone bad due to poor storage and came up with a an early form ofinsulated packaging—a corked bottle sealed in another corked bottle filled withwater. The new packaging worked, and successful vaccination programs wereestablished in Washington, Petersburg, Richmond, and other parts of the South.Jefferson successfully vaccinated seventy-eight family members, noting minoradverse reactions in great detail.Despite his successes with Jefferson, Waterhouse was not without detractors.Some claimed that he was arrogant and pushed vaccination for personal profit.The primitive nature of early vaccines and the lack of sanitary procedurescaused disease outbreaks because the vaccine often contained smallpox as well ascowpox. The public didn’t immediately embrace vaccination, and the Americanmedical establishment never fully embraced Waterhouse. Regardless, Waterhousepushed his vaccine agenda and ultimately prevailed.Mainstream medicine embraced vaccination during the late 1800s. Louis Pasteurdeveloped the germ theory of disease in 1877, and new vaccines for otherdiseases soon followed. Pasteur produced the first live attenuated bacterialvaccine for chicken cholera in 1879 and a rabies vaccine in 1885. Cholera andtyphoid vaccines were developed in 1896, and a vaccine for plague came in 1897.England ultimately passed vaccination acts, which first only encouragedvaccination. In 1853, vaccination of infants became mandatory, with the highestpenalty for refusal being incarceration. The 1867 law extended the requirementto fourteen-year-olds, and a backlash followed. In advance of the passage of the1867 law, Richard Gibbs, who administered the London Free Hospital, started thefirst Anti-Compulsory Vaccination League in 1866. Gibbs regarded compulsoryvaccination to be an infringement of individual freedom. According to Gibbs, thepurpose of the League was “to overthrow this huge piece of physiologicalabsurdity and medical tyranny . . . I believe we have hundreds of cases here,from being poisoned with vaccination, I deem incurable. One member of a familydating syphilitic symptoms from the time of vaccination, when all the othermembers of the family have been clear. We strongly advise parents to go toprison, rather than submit to have their helpless offspring inoculated withscrofula, syphilis, and mania.”5 [../Text/026_Notes.html#Afn2_5]Gibbs was clearly describing what he felt were vaccine injuries. He also claimedthat many family members of the vaccine-injured had presented petitions toParliament alleging that their children had died but that these petitions hadnot been made public.William Tebb, a businessman from Manchester, eventually took up the mantle fromGibbs. Tebb is described as being a radical liberal and was a member of severalliberal organizations, including the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty toChildren, The National Liberal Club, the New Reform Club, and the VigilanceAssociation for the Defence of Personal Rights. Tebb sought the repeal of thevaccination acts and was prosecuted and fined thirteen times for refusal tovaccinate his third daughter. He eventually became president of the NationalAnti-Vaccination League in 1896 and traveled to the United States in 1897 tocampaign against smallpox vaccinations. Smallpox epidemics resumed in the UnitedStates, allegedly due to low vaccination rates. Whether this was true or not isdebated, but it is certainly true that Tebb’s visits spawned the establishmentof American anti-vaccination leagues.The Leicester MethodEnglish anti-vaccination sentiment gained strength due to the popularity of analternate disease fighting approach called the Leicester method. Advocates ofthe approach noted that vaccination didn’t necessarily provide immunity as somevaccinated people died from smallpox—and from vaccine reactions.The city of Leicester’s “vaccination inspector” began prosecuting parents who“stupidly refused to have their children vaccinated.” Arrests for defying theVaccination Act went from two in 1869 to 1,154 in 1881. In some cases,magistrates issued fines, “but in most cases the parents deliberately allowedthemselves to be sent to goal (jail).”6 [../Text/026_Notes.html#Afn2_6]John Thomas Biggs emerged as an opponent of compulsory vaccination and becamethe outspoken advocate of the Leicester method. Biggs opposed compulsoryvaccination as being an infringement upon, and invasion of, personal liberty. Itis said that one of his brothers suffered a vaccine injury.7[../Text/026_Notes.html#Afn2_7]Biggs was a sanitary engineer, a member of the Leicester town council, andalderman, magistrate, and member of the Derwent Valley water board. He was alsoappointed by the Leicester Board of Guardians to develop and present itsMemorial and Statistical Tables—a skill set he used to document the advantagesof his Leicester method over vaccination.Biggs kept meticulous records and studied the smallpox epidemic of 1871–1873closely. He became convinced that vaccination wasn’t efficacious and didn’tprevent disease or mitigate its severity. Biggs collected data that showed thatvaccination was not as effective as mainstream medicine purported. He publishedhis findings in 1912 in Leicester: Sanitation versus Vaccination. The Leicestermethod is described by Biggs as follows:A new method for which great practical utility is claimed has been enforced bythe sanitary committee of the Corporation for the stamping out of small-pox, andthe chairman of the Committee has gone so far as to declare that small-pox isone of the least troublesome diseases with which they have to deal. The methodof treatment, in a word, is this: As soon as small-pox breaks out, the medicalman and the householder are compelled under penalty to at once report theoutbreak to the Corporation. The small-pox van is at once ordered by telephoneto proceed to the house in question the hospital authorities are also instructedby telephone to make all arrangements, and thus, within a few hours, thesufferer is safely in the hospital. The family and inmates of the house areplaced in quarantine in comfortable quarters, and the house thoroughlydisinfected. The result is that in every instance the disease has been promptlyand completely stamped out at a paltry expense . . . use plenty of water, eatgood food, live in light and airy houses, and see that the Corporation kept thestreets clean and the drains in order. If such details were attended to, therewas no need to fear smallpox . . .The effects of narrow, ill-conditioned streets; of imperfect drainage andimproper dwellings; of circumstances of environment; and of inherited physicaldisability must, and will for a time, continue. These adverse elements are beinggradually eliminated . . . the “Leicester Method” of Sanitation could biddefiance not to smallpox only, but to other infectious, if not to nearly allzymotic, diseases. Even for small-pox, not even the merest tyro among Jennerianvotaries would now venture to claim that vaccination could achieve all thatsanitation has accomplished. This is self-evident, because even pro-vaccinists,of the most pronounced type, now supplement the Jennerian operation with the“Leicester Method” of dealing with the disease. They dare not, as aforetime,trust solely to vaccination. To do so would, on their part, be culpable, if notin the highest degree criminal, neglect.9 [../Text/026_Notes.html#Afn2_8]Biggs compiled statistical data showing that his method worked just as well, ifnot better than, vaccination—and without vaccine injuries. Biggs took on thepro-vaccine medical establishment and produced evidence of vaccine injuries:I presented a table (pages 417-433, Fourth Report, Royal Commission) of 109deaths, 186 cases of injury (many of them permanent), and two of small-pox,following on vaccination, being a total of 297 cases in Leicester andneighbourhood, with the names, addresses, and details, each case being vouchedfor by the parents themselves. It is a harrowing, heart-rending catalogue. Thisgruesome testimony caused considerable questioning by the Commissioners, who,however, hesitated to accept such personal statements, unless supported byexpert medical opinion! The evidence of careful, loving mothers, who hadunintermittently tended their suffering little ones, was, it seems, not deemedtrustworthy without being thus peculiarly confirmed! Was it likely that medicalmen would convict either themselves or their brethren? Manifestly, those parents(who had “accepted” vaccination) must have been in its favour, rather thanagainst it. Otherwise their children would certainly not have been vaccinated.The most striking points in Table 1 are:(1) That the highest death-rates from erysipelas, both under one year, underfive years, and at all ages, are concurrent with the highest years ofvaccination ; and(2) That each death-rate practically touches its lowest point coincidentallywith the lowest percentage of vaccination.By no stretch of the imagination, nor by any subterfuge, can these facts be madeto tell in favour of vaccination. On the other hand, there is abundant andundeniable evidence that the practice operated most fatally.Biggs even alleged that medical authorities were engaging in fear mongering tomotivate parents to vaccinate, a claim often made by present-day vaccine safetyadvocates. He took on mainstream medicine’s support for vaccination. Britishauthorities attempted to prosecute Biggs on several occasions, but Biggs alwaysprevailed. His Leicester method resonated in England and offered a viablealternative to vaccination. The 1898 vaccination law allowed for conscientiousobjection to compulsory vaccination. England still allows conscientiousobjection today."},{"pageContent":"3JACOBSON V. MASSACHUSETTSThe United States in 1905 was a very different place than it is today. With thestart of the Industrial Revolution, more and more people poured into cities. Thestreets were full of sewage and animal excrement, as modern sewage and wastedisposal systems had not yet been invented. Cramped housing conditions wereatrocious—cold, dark and miserable in the winter; sweltering and oppressive inthe summer. Many apartments didn’t have running water. The fortunate few hadcommunal outhouses in the yard behind the building. Slaughterhouses were oftenlocated in urban centers. Many lived in sprawling shanty towns that we wouldcompare to modern refugee camps.These conditions–which Biggs and proponents of the Leicester method sought tomitigate–provided a breeding ground for disease.Also driving disease was the horrendous treatment of children who weremarginally educated, often forced into labor by age seven and exploited in everyconceivable manner. Children were often the victims of harsh working conditions,industrial accidents, and toxic exposures.Food was nutritionally deficient and often a source of disease. Refrigerationtechnology had not yet been developed, and food inspection was still years away.Clean water was often scarce, and people drank alcoholic beverages instead.People rarely bathed.The conditions of the masses were miserable and fueled disease outbreaks thatkilled thousands. Proper medical care was rare. Death and misery wereubiquitous. People—and government—were desperate.This was the reality of public health when the Jacobson case went before the USSupreme Court in 1905. Henning Jacobson, a Swedish immigrant and minister fromCambridge, Massachusetts, refused vaccination during a smallpox outbreak in1902. Jacobson claimed that a vaccine had made him seriously ill as a child. Healso claimed that a vaccine had injured his son and that he knew of others whohad been injured. He refused to pay the $5.00 fine, and the Massachusetts courtsrejected his arguments that the compulsory inoculation violated the state and USconstitutions.Jacobson “offered to prove that vaccination ‘quite often’ caused serious andpermanent injury to the health of the person vaccinated; that the operation‘occasionally’ resulted in death; that it was ‘impossible’ to tell ‘in anyparticular case’ what the results of vaccination would be, or whether it wouldinjure the health or result in death . . . that vaccine matter is ‘quite often’impure and dangerous to be used . . . that the defendant refused to submit tovaccination for the reason that he had, ‘when a child,’ been caused great andextreme suffering for a long period by a disease produced by vaccination; andthat he had witnessed a similar result of vaccination, not only in the case ofhis son, but in the cases of others.”1 [../Text/026_Notes.html#Afn3_1]The US Supreme Court didn’t accept that Jacobson’s fear of vaccine injuryoutweighed the public health authority of Massachusetts. The Supreme Court ruledthat freedom of the individual must sometimes be subordinated to common welfare.The $5.00 fine was upheld—nothing more than that. The Court ruled thatMassachusetts acted reasonably in fining Jacobson in the context of requiringadults to be vaccinated in an epidemic of an airborne disease.Children were not to be subjected to the mandate, as they were believed to betoo fragile.It is important to realize that mandatory vaccination today occurs in a verydifferent context. Children are the primary targets of mandates. Vaccines todayare mandatory today not because of an ongoing catastrophic epidemic of airbornedisease. The seventy doses of sixteen vaccines presently recommended aremandated in the name of herd immunity. Yet refusing vaccination can have realimplications for an individual’s educational and even employment opportunities.Medical and religious exemptions to vaccine mandates are often subject togovernment review.Jacobson is cited as the foundation of public health law but should be viewedwithin the realities of American culture at the turn of the twentiethcentury—and the diseases that affected that culture. Modern vaccines thatprotect against diseases that may be sexually transmitted, such as Gardasil, arequalitatively different from those designed to protect against airbornediseases, such as smallpox.Jacobson was supported by the Massachusetts Anti-Compulsory VaccinationAssociation. There were a number of Anti-Vaccination Leagues emerging around theUnited States by the early 1900s. As it did for Henning Jacobson and J. T.Biggs, concern over vaccine injury fueled their development.The anti-vaccine movement mobilized following the decision, and theAnti-Vaccination League of America was founded three years later in Philadelphiato promote the principle that “health is nature’s greatest safeguard againstdisease and that therefore no State has the right to demand of anyone theimpairment of his or her health.” The league warned about what it believed werethe dangers of vaccination and the dangers of allowing the intrusion ofgovernment and science into private life, part of the broader process identifiedwith the progressive movement of the early twentieth century. TheAnti-Vaccination League of America asked, “We have repudiated religious tyranny;we have rejected political tyranny; shall we now submit to medical tyranny?”2[../Text/026_Notes.html#Afn3_2]"},{"pageContent":"4CONTAMINATED “BIOLOGICS” AND A HORSE NAMED JIMVaccine manufacturing in the years around the time of the Jacobson decision wasvastly different from today. The serum for diphtheria antitoxin was derived fromhorse blood.1 [../Text/026_Notes.html#Afn4_1] There was no regulation orstandardized controls over biological drugs. Like many business ventures of thetime, the industry that produced vaccines and other drugs was not regulated bygovernment.In 1901, a retired milk wagon horse named Jim was found to be the source ofcontamination that caused the death of thirteen children in St. Louis, Missouri.Jim produced over seven gallons of serum over his lifetime. The tragedy wascompletely avoidable, as the contaminated serum could have been detected by thetechnology of the day, but samples from Jim, taken on different days, weremislabeled.2 [../Text/026_Notes.html#Afn4_2]The deaths brought the reality of vaccine injury and contaminated biologics togreater public attention. When a contaminated smallpox vaccine caused a child’sdeath in Camden, New Jersey, enough was enough. Congress responded with theBiologics Control Act, also known as the Virus-Toxin Law, in 1902. This act iscritical because for the first time, the government conducted oversight of theprocesses used for the production of biological products through theestablishment of the Hygienic Laboratory of the US Public Health Service. Thelaboratory was charged with regulating the production of vaccines andantitoxins. Producers of vaccines now had to be licensed annually for themanufacture and sale of vaccines, serum, and antitoxins. Manufacturingfacilities were inspected, licensed, and monitored by scientists. Products nowhad to be labeled by product name, expiration date, and address and licensenumber of the manufacturer.The deaths in St. Louis were a wake-up call that showed the danger posed bycontaminated biological products. Diphtheria antitoxin was made by inoculatinghorses with increasingly concentrated doses of diphtheria bacteria. The horsewas then bled to collect blood serum, which was bottled as antitoxin. Thehorse’s serum was then injected into a patient suffering from diphtheria in thehopes that the antibodies in the serum would cure the patient. However, thethreat of contamination loomed over every stage of the production process. Theimportance of the Hygienic Laboratory and the importance of its health officersbecame obvious. By 1907, clear standards were established to preventcontamination. The research at the laboratory led investigators into emergingsciences, such as immunology, in order to better understand why sudden deathssometimes followed repeated injections of biologics made from foreign protein,such as horse serum.Within a few years, Congress passed the Federal Food and Drugs Act to regulatethe production of food and other products. Ultimately, the Food and DrugAdministration was created. The deplorable health conditions of that time werebeing driven back not by vaccines–they were still an emerging technology fraughtwith contamination risks–but by an understanding that regulation of industry toimprove medicines, foods, and other products could improve public health.In 1914, Dr. Joseph Goldberger, an epidemiologist with the United States PublicHealth Service who worked at the Hygienic Laboratory, identified the cause ofpellagra, a scourge of poor Southerners. Pellagra was caused by a niacindeficiency and could be cured through the use of brewer’s yeast. Then Earl B.Phelps, director of the Division of Chemistry at the Hygienic Laboratory,identified how pollution affected oxygen levels in lakes and rivers.The new public health establishment was focusing on the environmental triggersof disease, and millions of people benefited. The government was leading the waywith cleaner water, healthier food, and cleaner cities through improvedsanitation, as championed by J. T. Biggs and the Leicester method. Disease ratesplummeted. The horrendous Industrial Revolution living conditions and abusivetreatment of children were fading from American life.3[../Text/026_Notes.html#Afn4_3]Few today realize that vaccine injuries ultimately opened the door to a level offederal regulation over industry that had never existed before. The result ofacknowledging and focusing on vaccine injury was better vaccines and an expandedvision of the need for government regulation of industry. The result was astunning improvement in public health and ultimately safer vaccines.Advocates for mandatory vaccination often declare that “epidemics of diseaseswill return” if vaccination rates are not maintained. However, mass vaccinationprograms for diseases that have reportedly been eliminated by vaccines startedin the 1950s after the disease rates had already plummeted. The chart on themeasles vaccination on the next page clearly demonstrates this.And when mass vaccination commenced, the specter of vaccine contamination—andvaccine injury—reared its ugly head almost immediately.images [../Images/17-1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"5THE CUTTER CRISISIn the 1950s, America was understandably gripped by fear of polio. While nevercausing the population-wide devastation of earlier pandemics, such as smallpox,polio was justifiably dreaded. Many people died, and many were left paralyzed.President Franklin Roosevelt was a victim. Stark images of children in ironlungs were seared into the public consciousness. The 1952 polio outbreak was theworst in the nation’s history—approximately 58,000 cases were reported, causing3,145 deaths and leaving 21,269 people with varying degrees of paralysis.1[../Text/026_Notes.html#Afn5_1]Dr. Jonas Salk, a brilliant and complicated man, developed a polio vaccine thatused inactivated virus. The March of Dimes heralded Salk’s triumph and urged thequick development of the Salk polio vaccine. The vaccine was hailed as a hugesuccess, and the nation justifiably celebrated Salk and his miraculousachievement.The Salk vaccine was competing with an oral polio vaccine created by Dr. AlbertSabin for the hearts and minds of the public health establishment. The March ofDimes supported Salk and was instrumental in getting the Salk vaccine to themarket first. Given the seriousness of the polio epidemic, the public pressureto do so was enormous.Salk believed that he had developed a technique to kill or inactivate the poliovirus using a system of high-quality filters and formaldehyde. And he had. Theproblem was that when production of the vaccine went from a small lab tolarge-scale industrial production, filtration and inactivation were not aseffective. At a lab run by the Cutter Company in Berkeley, California, livepolio virus was getting into the final product.Live polio virus was being injected into children.A public health officer in Los Angeles called the National Institutes of Health(NIH) on a Friday night reporting that two children vaccinated nine days earliernow had polio. Overnight, the triumphant celebration of the conquest of polioturned into a nightmare. The polio vaccine produced at Cutter lead to eightycases of polio in the children. These children then infected 120 other people.Approximately 75 percent of the victims were paralyzed and eleven died.Even worse, public health officials had been made aware of problems with theCutter vaccine but ignored the evidence.Dr. Bernice Eddy, a microbiologist who worked at the National Institute ofHealth’s Laboratory of Biologics Control (formerly the Hygienic Laboratory),conducted tests on the Cutter version of the polio vaccine on primates. Thevaccine caused paralysis in some of the primates. Eddy turned theevidence—including photographs of the paralyzed monkeys—over to her boss,William Sebrell, the Director of the National Institutes of Health. Sebrell didnothing about Eddy’s findings, and the faulty vaccines went to market.2[../Text/026_Notes.html#Afn5_2]Dr. Eddy, a middle-aged woman from a mining town in West Virginia, spent hercareer in the “Hygienic Lab,” as she still referred to it. Eddy was not ahigh-profile, Harvard-educated public health insider. And she was a womanworking in a male-dominated profession. Eddy and her team worked around theclock to run trials that ought to have been done slowly and carefully in advanceof the release of the Salk vaccine.No one knows why Sebrell failed to act. There is no doubt that Eddy’s teamidentified the problem and informed the hierarchy promptly. She personallydelivered the results and photographs to Sebrell because “they were going to beinjecting this thing into children.” Sebrell accepted the photographs andresponded by asking Eddy if she and her team wanted to be immunized. Eddydeclined, as did the rest of her staff.3 [../Text/026_Notes.html#Afn5_3]As often happens with whistleblowers, Dr. Eddy was transferred. She ended up inthe cancer section of the federal lab, where she discovered another vaccinecontaminant: the simian virus, SV40. Eddy ran experiments showing that SV40caused cancer in animals and grew concerned about cancer risks in humans.As the cases of vaccine-induced polio continued to mount, the NIH was in crisismode. Heated arguments about pulling the vaccine erupted in meetings of the NIHhierarchy. Some of the agency’s leadership were reported to be in denial andrefused to take the vaccines off the market. Finally, reason prevailed, and theCutter polio vaccine was pulled. Public faith in the polio vaccine took anenormous hit.It turned out that Cutter did follow federal standards in manufacturing thepolio vaccine. Inactivating polio virus in the Salk method was a process thatwas difficult to accomplish in large-scale vaccine production. The Salk vaccineproduction ought to have received deliberate and thorough oversight. But thepressure to stop polio was enormous. The public and political leadership wantedthe vaccine on the market as soon as possible. As is often the case withdisasters, there was a series of mistakes by people with the best of intentions.Not acting on Dr. Eddy’s research was the final mistake in a series ofmisjudgments.Sebrell and other NIH administrators resigned, and public trust in vaccines wasseverely damaged. In court proceedings, Cutter was ultimately found not to benegligent but was still required to pay damages. In Gottsdanker v. CutterLaboratories the California Court of Appeals ruled as follows:In returning its verdicts for plaintiffs, however, the jury drew a thoughtfuland careful statement, setting forth that the jury had first considered theissue of negligence, and had “from a preponderance of the evidence concludedthat the defendant, Cutter Laboratories, was not negligent either directly or byinference. . . . With regard to the law of warranty, however, we feel that wehave no alternative but to conclude that Cutter Laboratories came to market . .. vaccine which when given to plaintiffs caused them to come down withpoliomyelitis, thus resulting in a breach of warranty. For this cause alone wefind in favor of plaintiffs.Cutter would survive, but vaccine manufacturers bristled at having been foundlegally liable for vaccine injury even though they had followed federalstandards. Many in the vaccine industry argued that the federal government hadfailed to provide proper oversight.If vaccines are so important to public but still carry a risk of injury, shouldthe manufacturer carry all of the liability?The Discovery of Simian Virus 40Dr. Maurice Hilleman picked up on Eddy’s research and verified that SV40 was acontaminant in both the Salk injectable vaccine and Sabin oral vaccine. Eddyproved that SV40 caused cancer in hamsters. Hilleman found that it caused cancerin African Green Monkeys—after both vaccines had been given to over one hundredmillion Americans.Hilleman came to the conclusion that SV40 induced slow-growing cancers inhumans. The impact from the contaminated vaccines might not be realized foryears. Hilleman presented his findings at an international polio vaccineconference in 1960. According to Vaccine author Arthur Allen, Hilleman wasimmediately attacked by the conference attendees. The Russians, who hadadministered the vaccine to fifty million people, quickly evacuated the room.Hilleman seems to have been stunned by the response to the information hepresented.4 [../Text/026_Notes.html#Afn5_4]Sabin criticized Hilleman and stated that the SV40 revelation would hurt thevaccine program. Sabin confronted Hilleman and asked what he thought couldhappen as a result of the SV40 contamination. Hilleman answered that heobviously feared people would get cancer.In 2004, a paper presented at the Vaccine Cell Substrate Conference noted thatvaccines administered in what had been countries aligned with the former SovietUnion may have been contaminated up to 1980. Hundreds of millions may have beenexposed to SV40.5 [../Text/026_Notes.html#Afn5_5]Even though the SV40 virus has been found in human cancer cells, mainstreammedicine does not accept the view that cancer in humans is a result of thevaccine contaminant. The virus has also been described as a co-factor in thedevelopment of asbestos-related cancers—mesotheliomas. The theory in acceptancepresently is that mesothelioma is caused by asbestos. However, mesothelioma-typecancers continue to increase even though asbestos exposures have been reduced.Is it possible that Bernice Eddy and Maurice Hilleman have been proven right,all these years later?"},{"pageContent":"6THE RISE OF “VACCINOLOGY”The response of the vaccine establishment to Hilleman and Eddy does not leavethe impression that those who are now established practitioners of what is nowcalled “vaccinology” are open to receiving bad news about problems withvaccines. It is an impression that holds to this day. Dr. Andrew Wakefield iscriticized in the media on a regular basis for a paper he published in 1998about a case study in which parents stated that their children regressed anddeveloped autism after receiving the MMR vaccine.You will read cases later in this book where the National Vaccine InjuryCompensation Program has compensated children for brain damage. These childrenalso have a diagnosis of autism.1 [../Text/026_Notes.html#Afn6_1] These arecases described as “MMR table encephalopathies.” Yet the attacks on Wakefield byvaccinologists continue. The message is clear; talking about vaccine injuries isnot good for your career. We have spoken to doctors who have acknowledged that aclimate of fear presently exists that suppresses discourse on vaccine injuries.Vaccinology is defined as the science of vaccine development. The NationalFoundation for Infectious Diseases (NFID) offers a “clinical vaccinology” coursetwice a year. The course is taught by highly credentialed experts in vaccinologyand deals with the latest developments in the use of vaccines. The targetaudience is medical professionals.The NFID receives 75 percent of its funding from pharmaceutical companies. Theboard of directors features public health professionals from industry,government, and academia. The pro-vaccine messages on the NFID website arecrystal clear.Those in the field of vaccinolgy now hold critical power over many of thegovernment organs responsible for the safety of vaccines. Over the years, thoseinvolved in the development, marketing, and sale of vaccines have become thepublic health establishment. This is not just the opinion of the authors. The USHouse of Representatives has come to the same conclusion.In June 2000, the House of Representatives Oversight and Government ReformCommittee issued a report on Conflicts of Interest in Vaccine Policy Making. Theintroduction to the report makes the point clearly:In August 1999, the Committee on Government Reform initiated an investigationinto Federal vaccine policy. Over the last six months, this investigation hasfocused on possible conflicts of interest on the part of Federal policy-makers.Committee staff has conducted an extensive review of financial disclosure formsand related documents, and interviewed key officials from the Department ofHealth and Human Services, including the Food and Drug Administration and theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.This staff report focuses on two influential advisory committees utilized byFederal regulators to provide expert advice on vaccine policy:1. The FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee(VRBPAC);and2. The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunizations Practices (ACIP).The VRBPAC advises the FDA on the licensing of new vaccines, while the ACIPadvises the CDC on guidelines to be issued to doctors and the states for theappropriate use of vaccines.Members of the advisory committees are required to disclose any financialconflicts of interest and recuse themselves from participating in decisions inwhich they have an interest. The Committee’s investigation has determined thatconflict of interest rules employed by the FDA and the CDC have been weak,enforcement has been lax, and committee members with substantial ties topharmaceutical companies have been given waivers to participate in committeeproceedings. Among the specific problems identified in this staff report:§ The CDC routinely grants waivers from conflict of interest rules to everymember of its advisory committee.§ CDC Advisory Committee members who are not allowed to vote on certainrecommendations due to financial conflicts of interest are allowed toparticipate in committee deliberations and advocate specific positions.§ The Chairman of the CDC’s advisory committee until very recently owned 600shares of stock in Merck, a pharmaceutical company with an active vaccinedivision.§ Members of the CDC’s advisory committee often fill out incomplete financialdisclosure statements, and are not required to provide the missing informationby CDC ethics officials.§ Four out of eight CDC advisory committee members who voted to approveguidelines for the rotavirus vaccine in June 1998 had financial ties topharmaceutical companies that were developing different versions of the vaccine.§ 3 out of 5 FDA advisory committee members who voted to approve the rotavirusvaccine in December 1997 had financial ties to pharmaceutical companies thatwere developing different versions of the vaccine.A more complete discussion of specific conflict of interest problems identifiedby Government Reform Committee staff can be found in Sections 4 and 5 of thisreport. To provide focus to the discussion, this report examines thedeliberations of the two committees on one specific vaccine—the Rotavirusvaccine. Approved for use by the FDA on August 31, 1998, the Rotavirus vaccinewas pulled from the market 13 months later after serious adverse reactions tothe vaccine emerged.As the House report details, investors and industry representatives involved inthe development of a rotavirus vaccine voted to approve the FDA’s licensing ofthe vaccine, as they were on the federal committee that licensed it.Problems quickly ensued, according to the report:A little more than one year after the Rotashield rotavirus vaccine was licensedby the Food and Drug Administration as a safe and effective vaccine, it wasremoved from the market due to adverse events. More than 100 cases of severebowel obstruction, or intussusception, were reported in children who hadreceived the vaccine.Rotashield was licensed by FDA on August 31, 1998. Distribution began on October1, 1998. On January 1, 1999 there were zero cases of intussusception on theVaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS). In May 1999 there were tencases of intussusception reported in the VAERS. Data was received from theNorthern California Kaiser active surveillance system and from statewide datacase control in Minnesota in early June that supported a relationship betweenthe Rotashield vaccine and intussusception. Dr. Jeffery P. Koplan, Director ofthe CDC, was briefed for the first time on June 11, 1999. A subsequent meetingwas held with Dr. Koplan and the CDC at which a decision was made to postponeany further use of the vaccine until further analysis was conducted. This waspublished in MMWR on July 16, 1999.As of October 15, 1999, 113 cases of intussusception had been received. Nine ofthese reported cases were determined not to be intussusception. Of the remaining102 cases of intussusception, 57 had received the vaccine. Of these, 29 requiredsurgery, seven underwent bowel resection, and one five-month-old infant diedafter developing intussusception five days after receipt of the vaccine.[xxv] Acase study was conducted that estimated that the risk of intussusception wasincreased by sixty percent among children who received the Rotashield.It is alarming that it was known during clinical trials and the licensingprocess that there were increased incidences of intussusception in vaccinatedinfants. The topic was raised at a VRBPAC meeting and a reference tointussusception is listed in the ACIP recommendation, however, the committeeapparently determined that the reported rate of 1 in 2010 was not to bestatistically significant. The CDC continues to provide inconsistent informationon their web site. One fact sheet, the Rotavirus Q & A, has not been updatedsince July 16, 1999 and does not provide a link to a more recent fact sheet. Thefact sheet significantly plays down the seriousness of the adverse event andasserts that no association has been made. [xxvi] Another Rotavirus Vaccine FactSheet was updated on February 2, 2000 that indicates that the FDA and CDCconfirmed the association between Rotashield and intussusception.During the clinical trials, five children out of a total of 10,054 subjectssuffered intussusception. [xxvii] If confirmed, the rate of intussusceptionwould be 1 in 2010 children. According to the manufacturer’s package insert, theadverse event was considered statistically insignificant at 0.05%.Intussusception had not previously been associated with natural rotavirusinfection.Rotashield rotavirus vaccine was removed from the U.S. market in October 1999.Development of other rotavirus vaccines continues by Merck and others.2[../Text/026_Notes.html#Afn6_2]Little has changed since the publication of this report. The money made onvaccines for the pharmaceutical industry and those rewarded by it has only ledto more power and influence by those invested in vaccinology. Given the waythose who question vaccine safety are treated today, one wonders what kind oftreatment a woman such as Bernice Eddy would receive. Would Dr. Eddy be asked topresent her findings at a meeting of the Vaccine Dinner Club?The Vaccine Dinner Club, or VDC, is an actual organization sponsored by EmoryUniversity, which many refer to as “CDC University” due to the amount ofresources it receives from the Centers for Disease Control, a critical player infederal vaccine policy. The VDC offers “hot food” and “cool science.” Thedirector of the organization, in a tongue-and-cheek manner, refers to herself as“a goddess.”According to its website, the VDC exists to facilitate networking andcollaboration between researchers, clinicians, policy makers, andhistorians/journalists who are interested in vaccination. The VDC has membersfrom federal and state government agencies, the pharmaceutical industry, andeven unnamed members of the “Fourth Estate” (print and Internet). The VDCreceives funding from the Robert Woods Johnson and Gates Foundations.The “Who We Are” section of the website is remarkable and honest because it is alisting of the powerful entities that support the field of vaccinology. As theparagraph shows, the lines between those who regulate in government and thosewho manufacture and distribute have become blurred.When did this start?In 1976 the CDC became alarmed over the possibility of a swine flu epidemicafter a soldier who died at Fort Dix tested positive for the virus. A flupandemic at the end of World War I killed thousands, and a return of the diseasecaused understandable alarm. The CDC urged manufacturers to quickly produce aswine flu vaccine, and Congress acted quickly to pass the Swine Flu Act. In whatwould ultimately become a template for the National Vaccine Injury CompensationProgram, the federal government agreed to compensate flu vaccine injuries.However, unlike the NVICP, those filing vaccine injury claims would have to usethe civil courts.A swine flu epidemic never occurred. However, four thousand vaccine injuryclaims were filed, mostly for Guillane-Barré syndrome. The vaccine is reportedto have resulted in thirty deaths, and the federal government paid an estimated$90 million in damages.In 1979, Mike Wallace of 60 Minutes revealed in an interview with CDC directorDr. David Sencer that the wrong strain of flu antigen had been manufactured. Thevaccine produced was not based on the strain of influenza allegedly found in thesoldier who had died at Fort Dix. In other words, thirty people died from havingreceived the wrong vaccine. If there had been an actual swine flu epidemic, thevaccine that was rushed to the market would likely not have worked.Those who are now in ascendancy in vaccinology have virtually no liability fortheir products. The NVICP now buffers the vaccine industry from regular civilliability. Mistakes that could result in vaccine injuries don’t seem to beconsidered on the menu of the Vaccine Dinner Club.However, the reality of vaccine injuries is being considered critical by some inthe mainstream, and controversy is sure to follow.On May 8, 2014, evidence of a schism within vaccinology appeared in an articleby journalist Lawrence Solomon of Canada’s Financial Post. Dr. Gregory Poland ofthe Mayo Clinic’s Vaccine Research Group made comments that many in vaccinologywould regard as heresy.“The old paradigm isn’t working anymore,” Poland told Solomon. The articlestated that some vaccines are losing their effectiveness and that the delivery—a“one-size-fits-all” model—is outdated. Poland is promoting a new idea called“vaccinomics,” in which vaccines will be tailored to an individual’s geneticmakeup. This theory is based on the work that the Mayo Clinic group is doing on“adversomics,” which seeks to understand and analyze adverse vaccine reactions.Poland states that adverse vaccine reactions may hinge upon a person’s geneticmakeup.Poland stated in Solomon’s article that “a small percentage of children who getvaccine-induced fever after MMR [measles, mumps, and rubella] will developfebrile seizures. I’d like to see predictive tests or preventive therapies thatcould be administered with the vaccine to prevent these reactions. . . . Thecurrent science doesn’t allow for an informed understanding of an individual’sgenetically determined risk for an adverse event due to a vaccine.”Solomon notes that Poland’s notions have detractors and that he has been greetedwith hostility in some quarters of the vaccinology community. However, asSolomon notes, mainstream publications such as Scientific American and TheScientists have described Poland’s work as significant and innovative.Dr. Poland opines that people ought to have risk information so that they canmake informed choices. The critical issue here, however, is the matter ofchoice. Right now, vaccines are mandated in most parts of the United States.Many people report that they have never received information sheets aboutvaccine adverse reactions from doctors. Many doctors appear to be uninformedabout the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), and it is generallyacknowledged that approximately no more than 10 percent of all vaccine injuriesare ever reported.An important question to be answered is what data is the Mayo Clinic’s VaccineResearch Group working with? Are the data kept by the pharmaceutical industryand the federal government? Is it not reasonable that this information be madeavailable to the public so that people—as Poland suggests—can make informedmedical decisions?If a serious problem with a vaccine did arise, how would the public be aware ofit if the data are unavailable? Given the hostility toward those who expressconcerns about vaccine safety, would those in the field of vaccinology have thecourage of Dr. Bernice Eddy to stand up to those in authority? Can vaccinologybe expected to police itself?"},{"pageContent":"7DPT: SEIZURES AND ENCEPHALOPATHYIn 1982, Lea Thompson, an investigative journalist at a Washington, DC, NBCstation, produced a documentary called DPT: Vaccine Roulette. The documentaryfeatured children with severe disabilities attributed to being injured by theDPT vaccine. The documentary is often blamed for generating a tremendousincrease in the litigation against vaccine manufacturers.The current narrative put forth by vaccine supporters is that Lea Thompson’sjournalism was flawed. She is described as having relied on parental reports andnot on science. The criticism is that Thompson’s documentary triggered a crisisand seemingly caused parents to believe in phenomena—DPT injury, or “DPTsyndrome,” as the British referred to it—that didn’t exist.The reality is that many parents in the United Kingdom and the United States hadbeen speaking out about the effects of DPT long before Thompson’s documentary.Parents were alleging that DPT had caused their children’s death, often referredto as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Others reported that DPT left theirchildren with seizures and brain damage. The reports of brain damage ranged fromADHD to severe infantile spasms. Some parents claimed that DPT left theirchildren with a disorder, rare at the time, called autism.1[../Text/026_Notes.html#Afn7_1] One group, led by Barbara Loe Fisher,Dissatisfied Parents Together (DPT), eventually established the National VaccineInformation Center (NVIC). Fisher became a leading vaccine safety advocate and,along with Harris Colter, wrote A Shot in the Dark, which documented theconnection between DPT and vaccine injury.A review of Thompson’s résumé reveals a professional investigative journalistwho uncovered many important stories throughout her career. The criticism ofThompson and Vaccine Roulette ignores the fact that DPT vaccine injuries had ledto serious research on adverse reactions. The National Childhood EncephalopathyStudy (NCES) was started in England in the 1970s by Dr. David Miller and othersto assess whether parental reports of DPT syndrome had merit. The NCES had beenunderway for years, with the first phase published in 1981—a year beforeThompson’s documentary aired. The NCES found that, on rare occasions, DPTvaccine did result in encephalopathy.The NCES was not a perfect study. One criticism was that there was nounvaccinated control group. At the time, the vast majority of children in theUnited Kingdom were vaccinated. It should be pointed out, however, that acomparative study on the health outcomes of vaccinated and unvaccinated childrenhas never been done. Calls for such research today are often shouted down asunethical due to the belief that every child must be vaccinated.The issue of encephalopathy as a result of vaccine injury is central in much ofthe modern debate around vaccine injury. Encephalopathy is defined by the VICPinjury table as follows:1. Encephalopathy. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, a vaccinerecipient shall be considered to have suffered an encephalopathy only if suchrecipient manifests, within the applicable period, an injury meeting thedescription below of an acute encephalopathy, and then a chronic encephalopathypersists in such person for more than 6 months beyond the date of vaccination.(i) An acute encephalopathy is one that is sufficiently severe so as to requirehospitalization (whether or not hospitalization occurred).(A) For children less than 18 months of age who present without an associatedseizure event, an acute encephalopathy is indicated by a significantly decreasedlevel of consciousness lasting for at least 24 hours. Those children less than18 months of age who present following a seizure shall be viewed as having anacute encephalopathy if their significantly decreased level of consciousnesspersists beyond 24 hours and cannot be attributed to a postictal state (seizure)or medication.(B) For adults and children 18 months of age or older, an acute encephalopathyis one that persists for at least 24 hours and characterized by at least two ofthe following:(1) A significant change in mental status that is not medication related;specifically a confusional state, or a delirium, or a psychosis;(2) A significantly decreased level of consciousness, which is independent of aseizure and cannot be attributed to the effects of medication; and(3) A seizure associated with loss of consciousness.(C) Increased intracranial pressure may be a clinical feature of acuteencephalopathy in any age group.(D) A “significantly decreased level of consciousness” is indicated by thepresence of at least one of the following clinical signs for at least 24 hoursor greater (see paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A) and (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section forapplicable timeframes):(1) Decreased or absent response to environment (responds, if at all, only toloud voice or painful stimuli);(2) Decreased or absent eye contact (does not fix gaze upon family members orother individuals); or(3) Inconsistent or absent responses to external stimuli (does not recognizefamiliar people or things).(E) The following clinical features alone, or in combination, do not demonstratean acute encephalopathy or a significant change in either mental status or levelof consciousness as described above: Sleepiness, irritability (fussiness),high-pitched and unusual screaming, persistent inconsolable crying, and bulgingfontanelle. Seizures in themselves are not sufficient to constitute a diagnosisof encephalopathy. In the absence of other evidence of an acute encephalopathy,seizures shall not be viewed as the first symptom or manifestation of the onsetof an acute encephalopathy.The NCES, the best research of the time, supported the theory that DPT vaccinewas causing encephalopathy. Many vaccine advocates denied that a vaccine couldever cause brain injury. However, as the reader has likely realized,encephalopathy is exactly that. The debate around DPT-induced brain damage washeated. Many who strongly supported vaccines did concede that while it was rare,vaccines were causing serious injuries, including death, even when the vaccinewas produced correctly. The legal term “unavoidably unsafe” is used to describesuch a product in tort law. The reality that vaccines were just such a productultimately led to the drafting of the National Childhood Vaccine Act.Vaccines reportedly had a low profit margin, and DPT manufacturers haddifficulty obtaining liability insurance. By 1985, only one US manufacturer ofDPT remained. The pharmaceutical industry told Congress that it would get out ofthe vaccine production business. Plans for the rationing of DPT were activelybeing considered by public health authorities. In 1986, parents and industrywere pressuring Congress to do something about “the vaccine crisis.” The medicalestablishment wanted a review panel of doctors to decide vaccine injury cases,and vaccine victim advocates wanted a fair compensation program. With HouseSpeaker Tip O’Neil’s final session winding down, Representative Henry Waxmanpushed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, which established the VaccineInjury Compensation Program, to a vote on the House floor. A few days later,President Ronald Regan signed the bill into law. The nation now had a no-faultadministrative program under the United States Court of Claims to compensatevaccine injury victims.And Vaccine manufacturers had an unprecedented level of liability protection.The intent of Congress was1. To compensate for vaccine-induced injuries2. To make vaccines safer3. To insulate industry and medical professionals from liability for vaccineinjuriesIt can reasonably be argued that the act only accomplished the third objective.The DPT vaccine was eventually replaced by the DTaP vaccine, which appeared tobe safer based on research from Japan. The DPT was a whole-cell pertussisversion of the vaccine. The DTaP utilizes an attenuated-cell version. However,many vaccine advocates continue to maintain that the DPT was safe and that thechildren who suffered from DPT syndrome had a genetic variant—SCN1A—thattriggered their seizures and developmental delays. This idea has receivedsupport in case decisions within the NVICP. However, the fact remains that theresearch suggesting SCN1A as the cause of DPT syndrome relied on a smallpopulation sample, only some of whom had this genetic variation. This study maywell be important, as it may indicate that people with SCN1A variant may have apredisposition to develop seizure disorders. However, there has never been apopulation-based study of the SCN1A gene variant. We simply do not know thepercentage of people in the regular population who possess this gene variationand how many do or do not have seizures or developmental delays. There is agrowing consensus that genes do not determine destiny; they operate within ourbodies, and our bodies are impacted by the environment.A study recently published in Scientific American is reporting that the DTaP isineffective. Many are calling for a return of the whole-cell DPT. Is it possiblethat those responsible for vaccine policy are willing to risk the consequencesof ignoring history?"},{"pageContent":"8THE NATIONAL VACCINE INJURY COMPENSATION PROGRAM—REFLECTION OF REALITY ORBETRAYAL OF A PROMISE?Many feel that the NVICP has betrayed the intent of Congress and thevaccine-injured. It is not at all clear that the program has improved vaccinesafety, as precious little information about vaccine injury is ever made public.How did we get here?It must be remembered that while many members of the medical establishmentadvocated for liability protection from vaccine injury, many others denied thatvaccine injury ever happened.There has always been a tension—some would say a conflict of interest—builtright into the NVICP. The very existence of the program announces that vaccineinjuries occur. However, the US government spends hardly any money at allpublicizing the NVICP. The Department of Health and Human Services, whichadministers the program, is also responsible for virtually every othergovernment organ of vaccine development, support, and promotion.The NVICP began with a lot of promise, and many vaccine injured people werecompensated justly and fairly. However, the eight special masters who presidedover cases that went to hearing almost immediately faced a huge backlog ofcases. A few early case decisions indicate that the Department of Justiceactually resisted defending the Secretary of Health and Human Services, therespondent against whom the petitioners bring claims.While case processing was delayed, money in the Vaccine Injury Compensation Fundcontinued to accrue. By 1998, the fund had amassed $1.2 billion.1[../Text/026_Notes.html#Afn8_1]images [../Images/34-1.jpg]Chart courtesy of Becky EsteppIn 1995, the Secretary of Health and Human Services modified the vaccine injurytable, removing residual seizure disorder (although not seizures) and tighteningthe criteria for encephalopathy. In a 1998 Washington Post Magazine article byArthur Allen, Special Master Laura Millman questioned whether the changes hadcountered the will of Congress that the program be “fair, simple, and easy toadminister.”2 [../Text/026_Notes.html#Afn8_2]Had the program become unworkable?The Secretary of Health and Human Services sided with members of the medicalestablishment. Dr. Gerald Fenichel of Vanderbuilt University disagreed with thefindings of the NCES and disagreed with idea of accepting documented casehistories of vaccine injury as sufficient proof of vaccine injury. Fenichelargued that case reports of vaccine injury—no matter how well documented—shouldnot be accepted as “scientific proof” and published an editorial in the Journalof the American Medical Association (JAMA) on his perspective: “The PertussisVaccine Controversy: The Danger of Case Reports.”In a field bereft of research not directly funded by manufacturers, wherestudies on non-vaccinated groups were never done, what other kinds of proof werepetitioners left with? What other kind of proof could be found? Would this biasagainst human observation exist in other legal arenas?Petitioner attorneys argued that Congress didn’t want petitioners to face theburdens of regular civil courts. What happened to the program Congress intended?Congress didn’t intend for petitioners to prove injury with scientificcertainty.Arthur Allen’s 1998 article provides important insight into what went on behindclosed doors at the DVIC, the Division of Vaccine Injury Compensation:They don’t want payments made for injuries that were not certainly caused by thevaccine. There’s a larger issue, too. They want parents to immunize theirchildren, and for that they want the record to show that vaccines are safe. “I’mnot going to say that awarding too many people will undermine vaccine safety,but I look on the Internet, and I see that our statistics are taken out ofcontext,” says [Dr. Geoffrey] Evans, the medical director of the compensationprogram. “And so it’s important that the table reflect what we think is reallycaused by the vaccines.”3 [../Text/026_Notes.html#Afn8_3]In that same Washington Post Magazine article, Chief Special Master GaryGolkiewicz admitted the government had “altered the game so that it’s clearly intheir favor. . . . This group has a vested interest in vaccines being good. Itdoesn’t take a mental giant to see the fundamental unfairness in this.”4[../Text/026_Notes.html#Afn8_4]Within ten years of the NVICP’s beginning, the cases being handled by theprogram were quietly being held to different evidence standards than Congresshad intended. Congress proscribed that the standard used in the program bepreponderance of the evidence—described in law as 50 percent plus the weight ofa feather. But Evans’s statement indicates that a more rigorous, albeit silentstandard had taken hold.While the Division of Vaccine Injury is responsible for screening cases thatenter the NVICP, it should be noted that most of the screening is now done bymembers of the medical and public health establishment who are under contract asexperts with the DVIC.5 [../Text/026_Notes.html#Afn8_5] The list of medicalexpert contractors is packed with well-credentialed members of the medicalestablishment, many of whom are very invested in vaccinology.The NVICP had become a captive of the medical establishment’s desire toreinforce the belief in the safety of vaccines. With the rise in autismprevalence—and a dramatic rise in petitioner’s claiming autism as a vaccineinjury—the problem reached a head."},{"pageContent":"9THE OMNIBUS AUTISM PROCEEDINGSIn November 2013 the House of Representatives Oversight and Government ReformCommittee announced plans to conduct a hearing into the National Vaccine InjuryCompensation Program. Amy Pisani, director of Every Child by Two, a pro-vaccineadvocacy organization that receives significant funding from the pharmaceuticalindustry, called on Congress to cancel the hearing, stating that those callingfor it “have a long history of claiming that vaccines cause autism, a hypothesisthat has been disproved by the medical and scientific community.”1[../Text/026_Notes.html#Afn9_1] Pisani stated further that “to dismantle theNational Vaccine Injury Compensation Program in order to appease fringe groupsthat have had their day in court would be a great disservice to public health.”2[../Text/026_Notes.html#Afn9_2]The position of the public health establishment, as Ms. Pisani’s letter states,is that the debate about vaccine induced autism is closed.The NVICP agreed, and the special masters issued their rulings that vaccineinjury does not result in autism. Case closed.And this might have been the unchallenged narrative had it not been for a littlegirl, now known as Child Doe 77.The Child Doe 77 case was one of the cases selected to be an Omnibus AutismProceeding (OAP) “test case.” A group of six cases was culled from the fivethousand cases filed in the OAP to serve as cases that tested the prevailingtheories about how vaccines may cause autism. There were MMR vaccine test cases,Thimerosal (a mercury-containing vaccine preservative) test cases, and a groupunder a combined theory. In 2008 the government pulled the Child Doe 77 case outof the proceedings and decided to award compensation to the child. It wasdecided that the nine vaccines the child received at age eleven months hadaggravated an underlying mitochondrial disorder and led to seizures,encephalopathy, and “autism-like symptoms.” While government representativesclung to the phrase “autism-like symptoms,” it needs to be pointed out thatautism is not a disease but a behavioral diagnosis that is rendered by aclinician when a child has enough of the symptoms that the Diagnostic andStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders delineates for autism.Despite the twisted parlance, Child Doe 77 had autism, and the governmentconceded that vaccines had caused it.The media coverage of the Child Doe 77 case was significant, and in the days andweeks that followed, other families came forward to say that they also hadchildren who had been compensated for vaccine-induced brain injury, and thesechildren also had autism.However, the OAP ended with stinging dismissals. Because Child Doe 77 was pulledfrom the proceedings, the settlement did not establish precedent and the NVICPruled that vaccines do not cause autism. It was as though the Child Doe 77 casehad never happened.In the Colten Snyder test case, Special Master Denise Vowel wrote, “To concludethat Colten’s condition was the result of his MMR vaccine, an objective observerwould have to emulate Lewis Carroll’s White Queen and be able to believe siximpossible (or, at least, highly improbable) things before breakfast.”What no one had yet realized was that the impossible had indeed been served forbreakfast many times before in the NVICP. An investigation led by coauthor LouisConte resulted in the publication of “Unanswered Questions from the VaccineInjury Compensation Program: A Review of Compensated Cases of Vaccine-InducedBrain Injury” in the May 2011 Pace Environmental Law Review. The review’sauthors, Holland, Conte, Krakow, and Colin, found that the NVICP had beencompensating cases for vaccine injury that featured autism for its entirehistory. The eighty-three cases identified, from available public records,reflected a fraction of the cases compensated by the program. Despite requestsfiled under the Freedom of Information Act, the government blocked investigativeaccess to the vast majority of cases.Those administering the NVICP never disclosed the actual history of autismwithin the program. Many working in the program have conceded that autism wasoften a sequela—or consequence—of vaccine-induced encephalopathy. The followingquote from the Health Resources and Services Administration’s (HRSA’s) DavidBowman to investigative journalist David Kirby is telling:From: Bowman, David (HRSA)Sent: Friday, February 20, 2009 5:22 PMSubject: HRSA StatementDavid,In response to your most recent inquiry, HRSA has the following statement: Thegovernment has never compensated, nor has it ever been ordered to compensate,any case based on a determination that autism was actually caused by vaccines.We have compensated cases in which children exhibited an encephalopathy, orgeneral brain disease. Encephalopathy may be accompanied by a medicalprogression of an array of symptoms including autistic behavior, autism, orseizures. Some children who have been compensated for vaccine injuries may haveshown signs of autism before the decision to compensate, or may ultimately endup with autism or autistic symptoms, but we do not track cases on this basis.Regards,David BowmanOffice of CommunicationsHealth Resources and Services Administration3 [../Text/026_Notes.html#Afn9_3]Bowman’s knowledge of autism within the vaccine-injured could only have comefrom one source: the Division of Vaccine Injury Compensation, which screens allthe cases that enter the NVICP.After reading Unanswered Questions, many petitioners in the Omnibus AutismProceedings asked why their children’s autism cases were not handled the way inwhich previous encephalopathy cases featuring autism had been handled by theprogram. Eventually, those involved in the proceedings admitted that OAP was notabout those cases where autism was secondary to encephalopathy. The OAP wasactually about “primary” or “idiopathic” autism—not “secondary autism.”Some clinicians suggest that that primary or idiopathic autism relates to thoseindividuals who have genetic anomalies that produce syndromes such as fragile X,Down syndrome, and tuberous sclerosis. However, idiopathic, defined as “arisingspontaneously or from an obscure or unknown cause”—is not quite correct here.Individuals who are dealing with fragile X, Down syndrome, or tuberous sclerosishave a known genetic abnormality. Part of the causation of autism for theseindividuals is understood. However, it is also important to point out that notall individuals with these genetic issues ultimately develop autism. There aremany people with these syndromes who do not have autism. Even in the presence ofthese strong genetic predispositions, autism does not always develop. It seemsthat something else must still occur, an injury of some sort, for autism todevelop even in people with known predispositions.In the decisions from the Omnibus Autism Proceedings, the special masters didnot delineate the type of autism—primary or secondary—that they were ruling on.The terms “primary” and “secondary” autism do not appear in any of the test casedecisions issued by the special masters. In the end, it was stated, in essence,that vaccines do not cause autism—all forms of autism.Is there really a difference between primary and secondary autism? Is thisreally a distinction without a difference? The history of cases in the NVICPstrongly indicates that brain damage induced by vaccine injury can leave theafflicted child with a diagnosis of autism, among other issues.This understanding of autism—“secondary autism”—developing in a person who hassuffered vaccine-induced brain damage is significant. A major purpose for theestablishment of the NVICP was to increase the understanding of vaccineinjuries. And yet this program’s “understanding” about secondary autism has beenacknowledged grudgingly.Is all autism really secondary autism? If so, we are then presented with anotherquestion: How could the petitioners in the OAP ever prove that a vaccine injurycould lead to primary (idiopathic) autism? How does one prove that a vaccineinjury caused a disorder that arises spontaneously? If petitioners in theOmnibus Autism Proceedings were to prove primary autism, the burden wasimpossible, and their cases may have been doomed from the outset. Interviewswith attorneys who represented petitioners in the Omnibus Autism Proceedingshave reported to us that this was indeed their burden. Petitioners had to provea different type of autism than the type that the program had quietly acceptedas a sequela in the years prior to the Omnibus Autism Proceedings.Further proof of the belief in the two types of autism is provided below. Notethe footnote at the bottom of the table from a March 2012 ACCV presentationabout a NVICP request to the IOM in 2009:The footnote states,“Secondary” autism or autistic features arising from chronic encephalopathy,mitochondrial disorders and/or other underlying disorders will be considered bythe Committee. For “Primary” autism, the VICP has asked the IOM to consider thereview of the medical literature post Immunization Safety Review: Vaccines andAutism (2004) report. In particular, VICP is interested in the Committee’sreview on more recent theories of “neuroinflammation” and“hyperarousal/overexcitation of the immune system via multiple antigenicstimulation.”The notion of primary and secondary autism was repeated in the March 8, 2012report to the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines, Updating the VaccineInjury Table Following the 2011 IOM Report on Adverse Effects of Vaccinescompleted by Rosemary Johann-Liang, MD, chief medical officer, National VaccineInjury Compensation Program.The theory of autism causation implied by the table below also explains thegovernment’s rationale for pulling the Child Doe 77 case out of the OAP,conceding the case, and awarding compensation. We now also have someunderstanding of why the odd phrase “resulted in autism-like symptoms” wasdeployed.Attorney Robert Krakow has pointed out that one can trace the “evolution” of theChild Doe 77 case through settlement decisions to where it eventually becomes an“MMR encephalopathy table injury.” MMR is emphasized even though the childreceived several other vaccinations that could also have been involved with herinjury. As a “secondary autism” case, the MMR caused braindamage—encephalopathy. The autism was a sequela of that encephalopathy. However,the vaccine did not cause the autism; the end result just included autism.The Mojabi case, settled in 2012, also a case from the Omnibus AutismProceedings, seems to have gone through a similar evolution. Mojabi is anotherMMR table injury that resulted in encephalopathy with autism:No. 06-227V Chief Special Master Campbell-SmithPosted 12/13/12DECISION AWARDING DAMAGESChief Special Master Campbell-Smith“On March 23, 2006, Saeid Mojabi and Parivash Vahabi (petitioners), as theparents and legal representatives of their minor son, Ryan, filed a petitionpursuant to the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (“VaccineProgram”). Petitioners alleged that as a result of “all the vaccinationsadministered to [Ryan] from March 25, 2003, through February 22, 2005, and morespecifically, measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccinations administered to him onDecember 19, 2003 and May 10, 2004,” Ryan suffered “a severe and debilitatinginjury to his brain, described as Autism Spectrum Disorder (‘ASD’).” Petition at1. Petitioners specifically asserted that Ryan “suffered a Vaccine Table Injury,namely, an encephalopathy” as a result of his receipt of the MMR vaccination onDecember 19, 2003. In the alternative, petitioners asserted that “as acumulative result of his receipt of each and every vaccination between March 25,2003 and February 22, 2005, Ryan has suffered . . . neuroimmunologicallymediated dysfunctions in the form of asthma and ASD.”images [../Images/42-1.jpg]Ryan Mojabi was compensated—$969,474.91.The authors recently contacted individuals who retired from the NVICP and theDivision of Vaccine Injury Compensation. It is now clear that many in theprogram had an understanding about autism that was never publicly stated.Retired employees have acknowledged that autism had always been understood to bea common occurrence in severe cases of vaccine injuries meeting requirements ofthe table injury for encephalopathy. One retired employee stated emphaticallythat the development of autism in the presence of severe encephalopathy wasunderstood by those in the program on both sides of the bar. The disagreement inNVICP about vaccine injury leading to autism involved cases where autisticregression was gradual. Another retired employee also confirmed that autism wasseen as an indication of brain damage in vaccine injury.The understanding of autism as a result of vaccine-induced encephalopathy needsto be fully reconsidered by the public and the research community. Theimplications are enormous given that the increase in autism appears to coincidewith the ramping up of the vaccine schedule after the passage of the 1986 law.Given the sentiment reflected in the statements of DVIC Director Dr. GeoffreyEvans in 1998—that the program reflect the beliefs of the medical communityabout vaccine injury—it is remarkable that so many of the cases identified asfeaturing autism in Unanswered Questions were conceded by the government.The question needs to be asked; is the government withholding the truth aboutvaccine injury–induced autism? Here is a summary of what we know:• The government conceded in the Child Doe 77 case that vaccine injury“resulted in autism-like symptoms,” then withdrew the case from the OmnibusAutism Proceedings to avoid a case decision, which would have set precedent.Ultimately, Child Doe 77 was found to have suffered an MMR table encephalopathy.• The government admitted to journalist David Kirby that some cases of vaccineinjury featured autism but that it didn’t track these cases.• Documents from ACCV meetings refer to two types of autism—“primary” and“secondary” autism, which arises from encephalopathy and mitochondrial disorders(as in the case of Child Doe 77).• Retired program employees have acknowledged that autism was understood to bea sequela of vaccine injury–induced encephalopathy.• In touching only a small percentage of compensated cases, UnansweredQuestions found eighty-three cases of vaccine injury that also included autism.Since the publication of Unanswered Questions, more cases of vaccine-inducedencephalopathy/autism, such as Mojabi, have emerged.The conclusion is obvious and disturbing. The people in and around the NVICP,the Division of Vaccine Injury Compensation, and the Department of Justice“understood” that autism was associated with cases of vaccine injury but failedto disclose what they knew, even though Congress intended for the program todisclose information about the nature of vaccine injuries.Unanswered Questions caused more than a few unanswered questions to be asked onCapitol Hill and ultimately fueled calls for a congressional hearing on what wasgoing on in the NVICP. Representative Darrell Issa, chairman of the House ofRepresentatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, announced that hewould conduct hearings on the NVICP at the end of 2013. The autism issue isdescribed as “scary” by Washington insiders. But it was once again leading tocontroversy about vaccine injury and how it was being addressed by thegovernment. Pro-vaccine activists, led by Dr. Paul Offit—the same Paul Offitcited in the House Oversight and Reform Committee Report on Conflicts ofInterest in Vaccine Policy Making—exerted enormous pressure on Congress to callthe hearings off (as stated in the letter by Amy Pisani). Potential witnesseswere contacted by committee staffers and nervously admitted that they faceddamaging their careers if they had to testify about the “autism issue.”Congressman Issa was faced with the prospect that a hearing on the NVICP waslikely to be extraordinarily contentious. Many potential witnesses contacted bythe Oversight and Government Reform staff indicated that they would refuse totestify. Pro-vaccine organizations lobbied hard to shut the hearings down. Issarelented and postponed the hearing.For the time being, vaccine advocates and the leaders of vaccinology seem tohave delayed congressional questioning. But due to the lack of transparencyabout previous cases of vaccine-induced encephalopathy featuring autism, thedecisions in the Omnibus Autism Proceedings are now regarded with suspicion. TheNVICP has lost public support and is no longer seen as a true justice venue bythose who claim vaccine injury."},{"pageContent":"10VACCINE INJURY CASESIt is worth noting that all of the cases here are actual orders issued byspecial masters or federal judges (on appeal or review) on compensated casesfrom the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. Some cases arecompensated before reaching the hearing phase by concession or settlementbetween the parties.As stated earlier, the vast majority of cases are not compensated and aredismissed. A review of the United States Court of Claims website will revealthis. One will also find interim decisions, attorney fee dismissals, and otherlegal actions on cases.Some cases are compensated after settlements. HRSA now makes the curious claimon the statistics report that settlements do not necessarily mean that theyagree that the case represents an actual vaccine injury. Some cases are concededby the government, and some decisions to compensate are rendered by specialmasters after hearing the facts. On rare occasions, a case is decided by a USCourt of Claims Judge on review or by a higher court on appeal.We are publishing these cases with some degree of editing to reduce the lengthof rulings and improve readability. We welcome all to visit the Court of Claimswebsite and review the actual cases.These cases are publicly available on the US Court of Claims website andelsewhere on the Internet. These are cases already in the public record. Somecases are reported under “Reported Cases,” meaning that they may be cited inlaw. Some are reported under “Unreported Cases,” meaning that they may not bereferenced in law. However, all of the cases in this book are publiclyavailable, consistent with the provisions of the 1986 act. We ask the reader torespectfully consider that these injuries happened to human beings and thattheir suffering—and the suffering of those who love them—is real. We ask thatyou respect the privacy of all involved.Immediately following are official statistics on the National Vaccine InjuryCompensation.

Secretary of the Department of Health and HumanServicesSummary: In this case decision, issued after a hearing, Special Master Dorseyrules that a varicella vaccination caused a child to suffer encephalitis,resulting in permanent brain damage.Compensated Vaccine Injury: EncephalitisEncephalitis is inflammation and swelling of the brain, most often due toinfections.Case No: 11-508VDate Filed: August 9, 2011Clifton Haigler and Charity Haigler, legal representatives of a minor child,Thomas Thurlow Haigler, v. Secretary of the Department of Health and HumanServicesDorsey, Special MasterOn August 9, 2011, Clifton and Charity Haigler filed a petition for compensationunder the National Vaccine Injury Compensation program, as the legalrepresentatives of their son, Thomas Thurlow Haigler, in which they alleged thata varicella vaccination that Thomas received on October 2, 2008, caused him tosuffer encephalitis. Petitioners further alleged that the vaccination “causedpermanent brain damage and will continue to block [Thomas’s] mentaldevelopment.”FACTSThomas was born on September 18, 2006, in Stanly County, North Carolina. Therewere no observed physical abnormalities. Thomas’s Apgar scores were 8 and 9, at1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The results of the North Carolina State newbornscreening blood tests were normal.Over the next year, Thomas had a number of childhood illnesses, but wasotherwise considered “normal,” “alert [and] active,” and “well developed.” Athis 10 and 12 month well-child visits, Thomas’s developmental milestones wereassessed by use of the “Ages & Stages Questionnaires” (“ASQ”). Thomas’scommunication, gross and fine motor skills, problem solving and personal socialskills were noted to be normal. Thomas’s hearing and vision were also noted tobe normal.On November 13, 2007, Thomas presented to his pediatrician with complaints of“tugging” his ears, nasal draining, and a cough. The assessment was bilateralotitis media, resolving. At this visit, Thomas received a number of vaccinationsincluding the mumps-measles-rubella (“MMR”) and Varivax vaccines. At his18-month check-up, on April 24, 2008, Thomas’s physical exam was normal exceptfor slight edema of his nose. Thomas was noted to be healthy, and his 18-monthASQ reflected normal development.On October 2, 2008, Thomas, age two, received a second full dose of the Varivaxvaccine at the Stanly County Health Department. Approximately two weeks later,on October 16, 2008, Thomas was brought to his pediatrician by his mother, withcomplaints of fever, cough, runny nose, mouth lesions and mouth pain, decreasedappetite, and an episode of shaking for approximately 10 minutes. While in thepediatrician’s office, Thomas began having tonic/clonic seizures. Initially, histemperature was 100.9ºF auxiliary, but it increased to 104.4ºF. Thomas continuedhaving seizures and EMS was called.Thomas was taken from the pediatrician’s office by ambulance to the StanlyRegional Emergency Department. On arrival at 1:39 P.M., Thomas was having aseizure and was unresponsive. Thomas was noted to be listless, post-ictal andunresponsive. At 3:39 P.M., he was in severe respiratory distress with rhonchiand wheezing. Thomas was intubated. Thomas was diagnosed as having statusepilepticus, seizure disorder, fever, bacteremia, and pneumonitis.At approximately 3:45 P.M., Thomas was taken by air transport from the StanlyRegional Emergency Room to the Carolinas Medical Center Pediatric Intensive CareUnit (“PICU”).On his first night in the PICU, October 16, 2008, Thomas had questionableseizure activity of symmetric, rhythmic jerking of his legs and smacking of hislips. An electroencephalogram (“EEG”) was conducted on October 17, 2008, andrevealed right frontal epileptiform activity. The laboratory studies weresignificant for elevated liver function levels, and a diagnosis of hepatitis wasmade.On October 16, 2008, an initial assessment performed in the PICU revealed thatThomas had multiple ulcers on his lips with dried blood. These were alsodescribed as “several labial [mouth] ulcers.” On October 18, 2008, Dr. Ahmeddocumented two lesions on Thomas’s lips and three “crusted vesicular lesions.”On October 19, 2008, the medical records state that Thomas’s lip lesions andleft auricle (ear) blisters had resolved. In the neurologist’s progress notedated October 21, 2008, an erythematous skin rash was documented. Theneurologist noted, “Question whether drug eruption or part of underlyingpossible infectious process.”From October 17 to 18, 2008, Thomas’s neurological examinations were abnormal,and he was unresponsive. On October 18, 2008, Dr. Amina Ahmed diagnosed Thomaswith meningoencephalitis and hepatitis. Tests for herpes simplex virus,enterovirus, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, Bartonella, cytomegalovirus,Toxoplasma, Epstein-Barr Virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and Arboviruswere negative. Additionally, bacterial and viral cultures of Thomas’s blood,urine and stool were negative. There is no documentation which establishes thatany of the health care providers who were treating Thomas at the time were awarethat he had received the varicella vaccine two weeks prior.On October 19, 2008, Thomas again experienced jerking of his legs and smackingof his lips. A video EEG showed suppression consistent with diffuseencephalopathy of a nonspecific nature. A repeat CT scan showed progressive lossof gray-white matter differentiation. While in the PICU, Thomas experiencedepisodes of teeth grinding, moaning, posturing and hypertonicity. He wasintubated from October 21 to 24, 2008, due to a decline in his neurologicalstatus. An EEG performed on October 22, 2008, showed diffuse disorganization,suppression and slow brain waves, but no epileptic activity.On October 28, 2008, Thomas was diagnosed with meningoencephalitis of unclearetiology. On October 31, 2008, the PICU attending physician diagnosed Thomaswith an altered mental status secondary to a “viral meningoencephalitis.” OnNovember 2, 2008, Thomas was noted to be “neurologically devastated, likelysecondary to viral meningoencephalitis.”Thomas was discharged from the Carolinas Medical Center on November 5, 2008. Hisdischarge diagnoses included meningoencephalitis, new onset of seizures, andhepatitis. Thomas was transferred to a rehabilitation facility for physicaltherapy, occupational and speech therapy.On April 17, 2009, Ms. Haigler called Thomas’s pediatrician Dr. Linda Lawrenceto report that Thomas had received a vaccine on October 2, 2008, and then had“an episode” on October 16, 2008, where he “broke out in blisters around hismouth and ears.” Ms. Haigler asked if the varicella vaccine could have causedher son’s encephalitis. She further stated that “her family physician told herthat the varicella vaccine probably could have caused encephalitis.” Dr.Lawrence reviewed Thomas’s vaccine history, and noted that the vaccine given tohim on October 2, 2008, was not his first varicella vaccine. Dr. Lawrence, orsomeone in her office, documented that the “medical opinion was that vaccine didnot cause encephalitis.”Petitioners subsequently sought a second opinion regarding the cause of andtreatment for Thomas’s seizures. On April 23, 2009, Thomas was seen by Dr.Jean-Ronel Corbier, a neurologist, at his Northeast Pediatric Neurology office.Dr. Corbier diagnosed Thomas with encephalitis, encephalopathy and partialcomplex seizures. Dr. Corbier subsequently reviewed Thomas’s medical records andordered and reviewed his diagnostic studies.On September 28, 2009, Dr. Corbier noted that a brain MRI performed on Thomas onAugust 21, 2009, showed global atrophy, and that an EEG performed on the sameday showed “diffuse epileptiform discharges and slowing” compatibility with a“diffuse underlying encephalopathy.” On November 9, 2009, Dr. Corbierinterpreted a 24-hour video EEG performed of Thomas as showing “frequent,multifocal and generalized epileptiform discharges that at times were almostcontinuous.” In February 2010, Thomas was diagnosed with cortical blindness.Based on the most recent medical records from 2010, Thomas continues to haveseizures, has a gastrostomy tube for nutrition, has limited motor function, andis non-verbal.On April 1, 2013, the parties filed a joint stipulation of undisputed facts.Among other things, “[t]he parties agree that Thomas received his firstvaricella vaccine on November 13, 2007, and a second dose . . . on October 2,2008.” They also agree that “Thomas suffered from encephalitis and that hisparents first sought medical treatment for this condition on October 16, 2008.”Varicella, commonly known as chickenpox, is a member of the herpes virus family,and is caused by the varicella zoster virus (“VZV”). Potential complications ofa VZV infection include neurologic complications, including encephalitis andmeningitis.To receive compensation under the Program, petitioners must prove . . . thatThomas suffered an injury that was actually caused by the varicella vaccine.PETITIONERS’ EXPERT, DR. CORBIERDr. Corbier became Thomas’s treating pediatric neurologist in April of 2009.Dr. Corbier opined that Thomas’s October 2, 2008 varicella vaccination causedhim to develop meningoencephalitis, which resulted in prolonged seizures,“global developmental delay, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, and veryrefractory epilepsy.” Dr. Corbier considers all of these injuries to be part ofa more generalized seizure disorder. Dr. Corbier describes Thomas’s currentcondition as “a severe, ongoing seizure disorder . . . along with severeneurological regression . . . which persists till this day.”Dr. Corbier testified as follows:While the research has shown that while rare, it’s not a common occurrence atall, but while rare, in certain cases vaccination, including in kids withvaricella, can lead to devastating neurological complications, includingmeningoencephalitis . . . So based on all of this information, my conclusion hasbeen and still continues to be that the varicella vaccine much more likely thannot contributed to Thomas Haigler’s devastating change as far asmeningoencephalitis, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, and the devastation thatwe see today.MEDICAL LITERATUREDr. Corbier cites several studies which support his opinion that individuals maydevelop an infection after a varicella vaccination, which can lead to thedevelopment of meningoencephalitis and resulting neurological complications,including seizures.Dr. Corbier cited the Chouliaras article, a case report of “an immunocompetent3½ year old girl who developed encephalitis and herpes zoster opthalmieus 20months after her immunization with varicella zoster virus vaccine.” The authorsconcluded that the “[VZV] vaccine strain may cause encephalitis in children evenin the absence of underlying immunodeficiency.”Dr. Corbier also referenced the Iyer article, where the authors described a caseof “vaccine associated aseptic meningitis after herpes zoster in a previouslyhealthy child.” The authors noted that “serious adverse events have occasionallybeen reported with vaccine-strain varicella-zoster virus,” and that the“varicella zoster virus has increasingly been implicated in central nervoussystem (‘CNS’) infections in immunocompetent individuals as well.”Dr. Corbier also referenced the Chaves article*. The authors of this articlefound that 5% of documented adverse events associated with the varicella vaccinewere “serious.” These adverse events included meningitis, fever, encephalopathy,and seizures.Finally, Dr. Corbier referenced the Koskiniemi collaborative study, which foundthat the “[v]aricella-zoster virus . . . was the main agent associated withencephalitis,” in a study of “3231 patients with acute central nervous system .. . symptoms of suspected viral origin.” The authors found that “VZV seems tohave achieved a major role in viral infections of [the central nervous system].”RESPONDENT’S EXPERT, DR. HOLMESDr. Gregory Holmes, also a pediatric neurologist, testified on behalf ofrespondent.Dr. Holmes estimated that he has treated five to seven patients for varicellaencephalitis, and has seen “a lot of post-infectious varicella problems.” Noneof the patients, however, had developed varicella encephalitis secondary to avaccine.Dr. Holmes asserted that Thomas’s vaccination did not cause his injuries,although he agreed that the varicella vaccine can cause neurologic injuries,including those from which Thomas suffers. Dr. Holmes agrees with Dr. Corbierthat medical reports have documented a causal relationship between the varicellavaccine and encephalitis.He testified that the varicella vaccine contains a live virus that “could invadethe central nervous system” and cause encephalitis. Although he considered it“[e]xtremely rare . . . in people that are not immunocompromised,” Dr. Holmesagreed that the varicella vaccine can cause an individual to develop bothencephalitis and an encephalopathy through a direct or primary varicellainfection.PETITIONERS’ EXPERT, DR. CORBIERDr. Corbier opines that there is a logical sequence of cause and effect betweenThomas’s vaccination and his encephalitis. First, Dr. Corbier states that Thomasexhibited signs and symptoms of an infectious process shortly after his secondvaricella vaccination on October 2, 2008, including blisters, fever, andseizures. Dr. Corbier testified that:Well, the logical sequence is that a young child is given a live attenuatedvaccine. The vaccine is shown under—based on the information that we have inrare cases to in some patients lead to certain neurological complications. Weknow that Thomas was given two doses [of the varicella vaccine] that were fairlyclose together and . . . two weeks later he developed blisters and other changesto suggest that perhaps he developed complications from the varicella vaccine.So I believe there is a logical sequence there of events.Dr. Corbier also based his causation opinion on the fact that Thomas had “anextensive workup which included lumbar puncture, neuroimaging, and various labs,was diagnosed with meningoencephalitis . . . and had evidence of hepatitis,” andthat there was no other viral explanation found for his illness.” Variousviruses were ruled out during Thomas’s hospitalization, including HSV, EBV,LMCV, adenoviruses, Bartonella, and Arbovirus. There is no evidence to suggestthat Thomas was exposed to any virus other than the VZV within a medicallyappropriate time frame.Lastly, Dr. Corbier considered the time frame within which Thomas’s injuriesmanifested after his vaccination as strong support for his opinion that they arevaccine-related. Thomas rapidly became more ill and “quickly went on to developsevere epilepsy and global devastation.” Based on the timeline, Dr. Corbieropined that Thomas’s clinical course provided circumstantial evidence of a“clear-cut event” of vaccine-induced harm.EVALUATION OF THE EVIDENCEDr. Corbier’s opinion regarding causation is straightforward. After receivingthe varicella vaccine, with a live attenuated virus, Thomas developed avaricella infection, either through direct infection or reactivation, whichcaused encephalitis. He then developed severe epilepsy and global neurologicaldevastation.It is uncontested that Thomas was exposed to varicella through the vaccination,and the treating physicians and experts agree that his encephalitis is mostlikely due to a viral infection. As discussed, Thomas’s clinical course wasconsistent with viral encephalitis, and there is no evidence of exposure to anyother virus that would have caused it. The most likely viruses were tested forand ruled out, except that no specific testing was performed for the VZV. Theonly known virus to which Thomas was exposed was the VZV contained in hissubject vaccination.All of these factual findings provide sufficient circumstantial evidence for theundersigned to conclude that Thomas’s subject vaccine more likely than notcaused his encephalitis and resultant injuries.CONCLUSIONFor the reasons discussed above, the undersigned finds that petitioners areentitled to compensation because they have provided sufficient circumstantialevidence that preponderates in their favor.IT IS SO ORDERED.Katea D. Stitt, as Personal Representative of the Estate of Pamela Wanga Stitt,Petitioner v. Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services,RespondentSummary: In this case decision, Special Master Zane rules after a hearing thatthe petitioner died as a result of vaccine induced Guillain-Barré syndrome(“GBS”).Compensated Vaccine Injury: Guillain-Barré Syndrome (“GBS”) Leading to DeathGuillain-Barré syndrome is a disorder in which the body’s immune system attackspart of the peripheral nervous system. The first symptoms of this disorderinclude varying degrees of weakness or tingling sensations in the legs. In manyinstances, the weakness and abnormal sensations spread to the arms and upperbody. These symptoms can increase in intensity until the muscles cannot be usedat all and the patient is almost totally paralyzed. In these cases, the disorderis life-threatening and is considered a medical emergency. The patient is oftenput on a ventilator to assist with breathing. Most patients, however, recoverfrom even the most severe cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), although somecontinue to have some degree of weakness. Guillain-Barré syndrome is rare.Case No: 09-653VDate Filed: May 31, 2013Katea D. Stitt, as Personal Representative of the Estate of Pamela Wanga Stitt,Petitioner v. Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services,RespondentCase No: 09-653VDate Filed: May 31, 2013RULING ON ENTITLEMENTSpecial Master ZaneThis matter is before the undersigned on the issue of entitlement following ahearing. Petitioner, Katea D. Stitt (“Petitioner”), as the personalrepresentative of the estate of her mother, Pamela Wanga Stitt (“Mrs. Stitt”),filed this petition alleging that the trivalent influenza (“flu”) vaccinationMrs. Stitt received on September 25, 2008, caused Mrs. Stitt to developGuillain-Barré Syndrome (“GBS”), which then caused her death. Petitioner seekscompensation pursuant to the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act.Petitioner contends that the evidence shows that it is more probable than notthat the flu vaccine was a substantial factor in causing Mrs. Stitt’s GBS andsubsequent death. Petitioner relies on molecular mimicry as the medical theorythat causally connects the flu vaccine to GBS. Petitioner argues that Mrs.Stitt’s clinical picture and the results of diagnostic tests demonstrate alogical sequence of cause and effect showing the flu vaccine caused Mrs. Stitt’sGBS. Finally, Petitioner maintains that the 5½ weeks between the vaccine andMrs. Stitt’s hospitalization are within the standard, medically acceptable timeframe of six weeks between infection and onset of symptoms. Petitioner arguesthat she has satisfied her burden and shown by preponderant evidence that theflu vaccine caused her GBS, which, in turn, caused her death.Respondent argues that Petitioner has not satisfied her burden of proof.Although Respondent acknowledges that Mrs. Stitt’s GBS was one of the causes ofher death, Respondent claims that Petitioner has failed to satisfy her burden ofshowing the flu vaccine caused Mrs. Stitt’s GBS. Respondent contends thatPetitioner’s presentation of molecular mimicry as a theory is inadequate becausePetitioner has failed to identify a specific protein in the peripheral myelin asbeing similar to the antigen in the flu vaccine as evidence that molecularmimicry could occur. Respondent also contends that because Petitioner could notpoint to any direct evidence that would specifically identify the vaccine as thecause, Petitioner did not present sufficient evidence to show a logical sequenceof cause and effect. Respondent further claims that Petitioner also failed toshow a logical sequence because epidemiological evidence indicates that in amajority of GBS cases, the cause is an infection. As a result, Respondent claimsthat the cause of Mrs. Stitt’s GBS is more likely to be something other than thevaccine. Thus, according to Respondent, Petitioner fails to present sufficientevidence that the vaccine was a substantial factor in causing Mrs. Stitt’s GBSand subsequent death.For the reasons set forth below, upon review of the record as a whole, theundersigned concludes that Petitioner has satisfied her burden. She has shown bypreponderant evidence that the vaccine was a substantial factor in bringingabout Mrs. Stitt’s GBS. And Mrs. Stitt’s GBS was a substantial factor inbringing about her death. Petitioner is entitled to compensation.FACTSThe facts as evidenced by the records and testimony are as follows:Mrs. Stitt received an influenza (“flu”) vaccination on September 25, 2008, ather local Safeway store. She was 74. At that time, Mrs. Stitt’s medicalcondition was generally healthy, although she did have hypertension. Mrs.Stitt’s medical history indicated that she had had gallbladder surgery andintermittent lower back pain over the last few years. Mrs. Stitt had also hadsome specific orthopedic issues, i.e., rotator cuff problems and a twistedankle. Approximately a week after she received the flu vaccine, on October 2,2008, Mrs. Stitt went to her orthopedist, Dr. Moskovitz, for a follow-up on herright knee and left shoulder pain (Rotator Cuff Syndrome). At that time, Mrs.Stitt mentioned a new complaint, i.e., stiffness and pain in both her hands andin her fingers, with the symptoms being greater in her right versus her lefthand and fingers.On October 30, 2008, Mrs. Stitt visited her primary care physician/internist,Dr. George Graves, for a follow-up on her hypertension. Mrs. Stitt reiteratedthe complaint she had made to her orthopedist of tingling in her hand up to herelbow for the past month. She denied complaints of chest pain, shortness ofbreath, and cough. There was no indication of any complaints of stomachproblems, nausea, diarrhea or vomiting.A few days later, on November 3, 2008, Mrs. Stitt telephoned her doctorcomplaining of tingling in her hands and feet. Later that same day, Mrs. Stittwas admitted to Sibley Hospital due to leg weakness. At the time of heradmission, Mrs. Stitt told the admitting personnel that she had had leg weaknesssince the morning, that her knees buckled twice, and that she experiencedshortness of breath and polyuria.Upon admission, Dr. Mahgoub, a neurologist, provided a consult. He specificallynoted that Mrs. Stitt had received a flu vaccine four weeks before admission andthat the differential diagnosis, which included GBS, was well described. Havingnoted the receipt of the flu vaccine and possible GBS diagnosis, Dr. Mahgoubnoted that the Centers for Disease Control (“CDC”) and Food and DrugAdministration (“FDA”) had not issued an alert in connection with the fluvaccine. Nonetheless, Dr. Mahgoub made a note to contact the CDC out of concernregarding the vaccine being a possible cause. Mrs. Stitt’s laboratory testsshowed an elevated glucose level and elevated liver enzymes with otherwisenormal results. Mrs. Stitt continued to experience leg weakness, as well asweakness in her arms.On November 6, 2008, the results from an electrodiagnostic study confirmed thatMrs. Stitt’s presentation was consistent with GBS. Mrs. Stitt was treated with atwo-day course of IVIG. Because she developed shallow breathing and an increasedrespiratory rate on that day, Mrs. Stitt was intubated. Within a day, Mrs. Stittdeveloped what was diagnosed as staphylococcus pneumonia. She was treated withantibiotics. Mrs. Stitt also developed a fever and an elevated white blood cellcount.Beginning November 10, 2008, Mrs. Stitt’s strength in her extremities began toreturn and her breathing improved. However, it was also determined that Mrs.Stitt had developed hemolytic anemia due to her IVIG treatment. As a result, herIVIG treatment was stopped after just two courses.By November 12, 2008, Mrs. Stitt’s pneumonia had resolved. Later that day, Mrs.Stitt was removed from the ventilator. Mrs. Stitt was noted to be “doing quitewell” and to have a good voice. On November 13, 2008, Mrs. Stitt was again notedto be “doing well,” “breathing easily,” and “swallowing without difficulty,” andher pneumonia had resolved. Plans were made to transfer Mrs. Stitt to theNational Rehabilitation Hospital.On November 14, 2008, Mrs. Stitt was discharged from Sibley Hospital to theNational Rehabilitation Hospital. The discharge summary indicated that Mrs.Stitt was diagnosed with, inter alia, GBS. The doctors told Petitioner that Mrs.Stitt’s GBS was caused either by the flu vaccine or some other unidentifiedinfection.On November 16, 2008, while at the National Rehabilitation Hospital, Mrs. Stittexperienced severe respiratory distress and was transported to WashingtonHospital Center. Mrs. Stitt was intubated. A chest X-ray revealed bibasalinfiltrates and an echocardiography demonstrated a nearly collapsed ventriclesuggestive of hypovolemia (defined as an abnormally decreased volume ofcirculating blood in the body; the most common cause is hemorrhage). Anevaluation for cardiac arrest revealed that Ms. Stitt had a cardiomyopathy (ageneral diagnostic term designating primary noninflammatory disease of the heartmuscle, often of obscure or unknown etiology).On the following day, November 17, 2008, Mrs. Stitt’s EKG tests revealed changesin her ST-elevation and increased enzymes. She received cardiac catherization,which revealed non-obstructive coronary artery disease, elevated right heartfilling pressures, and takotsubo with severe liver dysfunction. Mrs. Stitt’s labresults revealed no abnormalities in her stool cultures.Mrs. Stitt was placed on a ventilator, and on November 18, 2008, she sufferedhypoxic respiratory failure while on the ventilator. Mrs. Stitt was determinedto have takotsubo syndrome with functional obstruction of liver outflow. Therewas no change in Mrs. Stitt’s status the next day, November 19, 2008. Later onNovember 19, 2008, Mrs. Stitt began to experience worsening hypotension due tosepsis versus takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Mrs. Stitt’s mental status worsened andher family decided that she should not be resuscitated. Ms. Stitt died onNovember 20, 2008. Her causes of death were listed as: (A) Cardiogenic shock;(B) Cardiomyopathy; (C) GBS; and (D) Pneumonia. An autopsy was performed onJanuary 12, 2009. The autopsy report listed the causes of death as, inter alia,(1) Septic shock with respiratory failure (clinical) and (2) GBS (clinical).The parties stipulated that Mrs. Stitt had been diagnosed with GBS at the timeof her discharge from Sibley Hospital to the National Rehabilitation Hospital.The parties also stipulated that the medical records listed GBS as a cause ofher death. Finally, the parties stipulated that the autopsy report identifiedGBS as one of the causes of Mrs. Stitt’s death.DISCUSSIONA. Petitioner Has Presented Sufficient Proof of a Medical Theory CausallyConnecting the Flu Vaccine to Mrs. Stitt’s GBS, Satisfying Althen’s Prong One.B. Petitioner Has Provided Sufficient Evidence Which Demonstrates a LogicalSequence of Cause and Effect Showing the Vaccine Was a Substantial FactorLeading to Mrs. Stitt’s GBS, Satisfying Althen’s Prong Two.C. Petitioner Has Shown That Mrs. Stitt’s GBS Occurred Within a MedicallyAcceptable Time Frame, Thereby, Satisfying Althen’s Prong Three.CONCLUSIONFor the reasons stated above, the evidence presented demonstrates that the fluvaccine Mrs. Stitt received was a substantial factor in causing Mrs. Stitt’sGBS. And, her GBS was a substantial factor in causing her death. Petitioner hasestablished entitlement to compensation under the Vaccine Act.IT IS SO ORDERED.Walter Ray Graves, and Lisa Graves as Representatives of the Estate of HayleyNicole Graves, Deceased, v. Secretary of the Department of Health and HumanServicesSummary: In this case, Merow, Senior Judge Merow rules, upon review after ahearing that the Prevnar vaccine caused the victim’s seizures and eventualdeath.Compensated Vaccine Injury: Status Epilepticus, Leading to DeathPREVNARCase No: 02-0211VDate Filed: February 25, 2013Walter Ray Graves, and Lisa Graves as Representatives of the Estate of HayleyNicole Graves, Deceased, v. Secretary of the Department of Health and HumanServicesMerow, Senior JudgeFollowing the death of their infant daughter Hayley, petitioners Walter and LisaGraves allege that a Prevnar vaccination on August 8, 2000, caused the onset ofHayley’s seizures two days later. She was hospitalized immediately andcontinually thereafter for twenty-nine days, primarily in pediatric intensivecare. Despite a battery of tests, treatment and examination by specialists,Hayley’s seizures were unremitting and she died on September 24, 2000. Her deathcertificate documents the immediate cause of death as “[s]tatus epilepticus,”and an underlying cause as “[i]ntractable seizures.” Neither Hayley nor herfamily had a prior history of seizures.FACTSHayley Graves was born on November 4, 1999 in Ft. Worth, Texas. At her well-babycheck-up when she was five months old no physical abnormalities were noted. Shehad attained all developmental milestones.At that August 8, 2000 appointment, at approximately 11:15 a.m., Hayley receiveda Hepatitis B and her second Prevnar vaccination.According to the affidavit of Hayley’s mother, Lisa Graves, filed with thePetition in this matter, the remainder of August 8, 2000, Hayley acted normally.On August 9, 2000, she was restless and stayed awake until about 10:30 or 11:00p.m. Early on the morning of August 10, 2000, Hayley woke up about 6:45 a.m.and, according to the affidavit: “she did not appear right. The left side of herbody was moving and it would not stop. We called the doctor’s office and waitedfor a return call; however, at 7:15 a.m. when we still had not heard back fromthe doctor’s office, we left for Cook’s Children[s] Medical Center.”Hayley was admitted and transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit(“PICU”) under the care of Dr. Brian Ryals, a pediatric neurologist. An EEGshowed “ongoing electrical seizure activity emanating from right central brainregions.” An MRI and CT scan were normal. Because barbiturate doses wereprescribed, she was intubated, ventilated, and an arterial line was placed. Shewas continuously monitored and received regular doses of anticonvulsantmedication, but her seizures did not stop.Hayley remained in intensive care until transferred to a “regular” room forabout five days until noon on August 29, 2000, when she was airlifted to theHermann Hospital Epileptic Center in Houston, Texas for evaluation and treatmentby Dr. James W. Wheless, Chief of Pediatric Neurology at the University ofTennessee College of Medicine, who later testified in these proceedings thatPrevnar could and did cause her seizures and did so within a medicallyappropriate time.For twenty-six days at Hermann Hospital, Hayley was evaluated by severalspecialists; multiple attempts were made to control her seizures withoutsuccess. Tragically, her seizures which started the early morning of August 10,2000, never stopped and Hayley died in the pediatric intensive care unit of theHermann Hospital on September 24, 2000.Hayley’s death certificate recorded her cause of death as “[s]tatusepilepticus,” caused by “[i]ntractable seizures.” An autopsy performed onSeptember 29, 2000, concluded that Hayley “died as a result of hypoxicencephalopathy which reportedly occurred following a seizure which developedfollowing a meningitis [sic] vaccine.”PROCEDURAL BACKGROUNDDr. Wheless was concerned that the Prevnar vaccination was the cause forHayley’s death and he referred petitioners to the office of Richard Gage. (Tr.272- 74.) Petitioners filed a petition for vaccine injury compensation onSeptember 16, 2002, alleging that Hayley suffered seizures and death as a resultof receiving Prevnar and Hepatitis B vaccinations on August 8, 2000.On December 26, 2007, petitioners filed a report from Hayley’s treatingpediatric neurologist and pediatric epilepsy specialist, Dr. James W. Wheless.Dr. Wheless opined:Prevnar vaccine is known to cause seizures, both afebrile and febrile (withoutand with a fever) and these can be serious, and potentially even lead to death.It is my medical opinion that Hayley’s vaccine was associated with the onset ofher seizures, which proved to be intractable and her acute encephalopathy, whichthen progressed to chronic encephalopathy accompanied by an intractable seizuredisorder, and ultimately this was fatal and responsible for her death. Anextensive evaluation was performed, including obtaining her brain post-mortem,and after examining this no other cause could be found. It is established thatPrevnar vaccine can contribute to this type of injury. Prevnar is established ascausing this type of injury and, in this case, it is also my belief that thevaccine did cause this injury.It is my opinion, based on a reasonable degree of medical probability, that thePrevnar vaccination, which Hayley Graves received when she was nine months old,caused her severe refractory seizure disorder that caused her death. This is acausation-in-fact opinion and is based on my role as her treating physician andas an expert in the field of pediatric epilepsy.Giving appropriate credit to the opinion of Dr. Wheless, the treating pediatricneurologist, and given the absence of any other reason for the sudden onset ofHayley’s intractable seizures which, despite her continuous specializedhospitalization, litany of tests and treatments and examination by specialistsdid not stop, the preponderant credible evidence bar of causation was met.CONCLUSIONFor the reasons stated herein, the court concludes that on the record as awhole, petitioners presented sufficient evidence to meet the Vaccine Act’spreponderant standard for causation of the biological plausibility of thePrevnar vaccine triggering the onset of seizures, as well as increased durationand intractability of seizures, supported by reliable medical literature andexpert testimony including that of Dr. Wheless, Hayley’s treating physician.The record evidence established a medical theory causally connecting the Prevnarvaccination with the instigation as well as the duration and intractability ofthe seizures which resulted in Hayley’s death. A logical sequence of cause andeffect was established that the Prevnar vaccine did cause the instigation ofHayley’s seizures and the increased duration and intractability within anappropriate time frame.Accordingly, the court determines that entitlement has been proven.IT IS SO ORDERED.Michael Stephen Saw, Petitioner v. Secretary of the Department of Health andHuman Services, RespondentSummary: In this decision following a hearing, Chief Special Master Patricia E.Campbell-Smith rules that the victim suffered a small nerve fiber neuropathy asa result of a hepatitis B vaccine.Compensated Vaccine Injury: Small Nerve Fiber NeuropathySmall Nerve Fiber Neuropathy; Finding of Entitlement to CompensationCase No: 01-0707VDate Filed: May 24, 2013Michael Stephen Saw, Petitioner v. Secretary of the Department of Health andHuman Services, RespondentRULING ON ENTITLEMENTPatricia E. Campbell-SmithChief Special MasterThis case is before the undersigned on remand. The issue before the undersignedis whether the Hepatitis B vaccines that petitioner, Michael Shaw, received onMay 5, 1999, and June 11, 1999, caused him to suffer a small nerve fiberneuropathy. The undersigned finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, thatpetitioner’s vaccinations caused his injury.In so finding, the undersigned notes that this ruling represents a “close call”and should accordingly be resolved in favor of petitioner.PROCEDURAL HISTORYOn December 20, 2001, petitioner filed a petition pursuant to the NationalInjury Compensation Program (Vaccine Program or Program), wherein he allegedthat his Hepatitis B vaccinations caused him to suffer a neuropathy. Thereafter,petitioner submitted an expert report opining that he either suffered thecondition of transverse myelitis (“TM”) or of chronic inflammatory demyelinatingpolyneuropathy (“CIDP”) as a result of his vaccinations.An evidentiary hearing was convened on March 12, 2008, to elicit the testimonyof Sherri Tenpenny, D.O., an osteopathic physician, on behalf of petitioner, andThomas Leist, M.D., a neurologist, on behalf of respondent. In a decision filedAugust 31, 2009, the undersigned found that petitioner failed to demonstrateentitlement to compensation. Specifically, the undersigned found that petitionerdid not suffer from either of the conditions TM or CIDP as his expert, Dr.Tenpenny, had asserted in her theory of vaccine-related causation. Accordingly,the undersigned found that petitioner failed to establish a logical sequence ofcause and effect as then presented, and denied compensation. Pivotal to theundersigned’s finding of no entitlement in Shaw I was the finding, after acareful review, that to the extent petitioner’s injury was a neurologic one,petitioner’s medical records indicated that the more likely consensus diagnosiswas a small fiber neuropathy. But, as Dr. Leist testified at the March 12, 2008hearing, “small nerve fibers lack the myelin sheaths that would be harmed by the[petitioner’s] proposed demyelination process.” Petitioner did not rebut thistestimony. Thus, relying on the unrefuted testimony of Dr. Leist, theundersigned found that petitioner’s proposed theory of causation, demyelination,failed when applied to The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program is setforth in Part 2 of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986.On September 21, 2009, petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration of Shaw I,asserting that the undersigned’s Decision was not in accordance with the law andseeking to introduce evidence, previously available but not filed, that smallnerve fibers “may well” be myelinated. The undersigned denied the Motion forReconsideration explaining that the evidence concerning small fibers wasavailable to the petitioner two years prior to the filing of the expert reportby Dr. Tenpenny and at the time of the hearing. The undersigned observed thatthe inability of petitioner to rebut the testimony of Dr. Leist was attributable“directly to Dr. Tenpenny’s acknowledged lack of expertise in neurologicalmatters.” Moreover, the undersigned noted that the newly presented informationregarding myelinated small nerve fibers was not persuasive “in the absence ofany evidence presented by petitioner regarding how this evidence supports thetheory of causation proposed by petitioner in this case for the specificinjuries of TM and CIDP that Dr. Tenpenny’s opinion contemplated.”Petitioner moved the United States Court of Federal Claims to review theundersigned’s decision. Motion for Review filed September 30, 2009. On review,the court determined that the Shaw I decision—was “thorough and wellreasoned”—in finding that petitioner neither suffered TM or CIDP, but rather asmall fiber neuropathy. The reviewing judge upheld the undersigned’s findingthat the unrebutted testimony at hearing established that “Mr. Shaw’s medicaltheory, demyelination, was incapable of causing small fiber neuropathy.”However, the court concluded that “in light of the purposes and structure of theVaccine Act, we find it in the interest of justice for the [undersigned] toconsider the effect of the newly offered evidence.” The court left to thediscretion of the undersigned the decision whether to re-open the record beyondallowing consideration of the new evidence and permitting respondent’s expertDr. Leist an opportunity to comment on that evidence.On remand and after consultation with the parties, the undersigned affordedpetitioner an opportunity to retain an expert in neurology to explain how thenewly offered evidence supported petitioner’s theory of the case. Respondent’sexpert, Dr. Leist, also was offered an opportunity to address the newlypresented evidence. Order filed March 12, 2010. Petitioner ultimately offeredthe opinion of Thomas Morgan, M.D., a neurologist, in support of his vaccineclaim. Respondent again offered the neurologic expertise of Dr. Leist, whochallenged petitioner’s newly asserted theory of causation.Another expert hearing was conducted on July 28, 2010 in Washington, D.C. Theundersigned sought the testimony of Drs. Morgan and Leist on the issue ofwhether or not petitioner developed a small fiber neuropathy as a result of hisHepatitis B vaccine series. On remand, Mr. Shaw continued to rely on a theory ofcausation in fact. In support of his claim, he has filed: (1) an affidavit, (2)medical records, (3) the medical opinion of Dr. Morgan, (4) supporting medicalliterature, and (5) post-hearing briefs. Respondent offered: (1) the expertopinion of Dr. Leist, (2) a number of medical articles, and (3) a post-hearingmemorandum to rebut petitioner’s claim.FACTSThe facts set forth below are largely derived from the undersigned’s recitationof the acts in Shaw I. In general, the parties do not dispute the facts of thiscase, but rather the medical and legal conclusions to be drawn from them. Asdirected by the Vaccine Act, the undersigned has carefully considered, inaddition to all other relevant medical and scientific evidence contained in therecord, the diagnoses, conclusions, and medical judgments contained in therecord regarding the nature, causation and aggravation of petitioner’s conditionas well as the results of diagnostic tests contained in the record. Declining toreview here the entirety of petitioner’s voluminous medical records, theundersigned focuses on the records upon which the parties have relied mostheavily.Petitioner was born on June 15, 1959. His medical history is most notable for acouple of concussive head injuries, a cracked pelvis, a chipped tailbone, afractured nose, and broken hands and feet. Prior to receiving the vaccinationsat issue in this case, petitioner traveled extensively in his professionalcapacity as the corporate general manager for a large, multi-national tradingfirm. He had responsibilities for approximately 30 offices throughout the AsianPacific region. Recreationally, Mr. Shaw enjoyed extreme sports activities,including motor cross riding, mountain biking, roller-blading, hang gliding,parachuting, rafting and mountain climbing. He also enjoyed golf, tennis,skiing, softball and basketball.In anticipation of scheduled business travel and as part of anemployment-related immunization program, Mr. Shaw received his first Hepatitis Bvaccination on May 5, 1999. He did not recall experiencing any effects afterthat vaccination. The next month, on June 11, 1999, he received his secondHepatitis B vaccination and a polio vaccination. The medical records indicatethat on June 21, 1999, 10 days after receiving the Hepatitis B vaccination ofinterest, petitioner visited his primary care physician, John Roberts, M.D., ofBlackhawk Medical Group, complaining of recurring numbness in his right legbelow the knee. Petitioner reported that the numbness had begun on June 17,1999, four days prior to his visit to Dr. Roberts and six days after he hadreceived his second Hepatitis B vaccine. The numbness was “now progressing to athrobbing pain.” Dr. Roberts noted a patient history of trauma associated withhis motor cross riding. Dr. Roberts diagnosed petitioner with lumbar strain andnerve compression. Dr. Roberts prescribed prednisone and urged petitioner toobtain x-rays and magnetic resonance image (MRI) of his back.Petitioner began an international business trip on June 23, 1999. In hisaffidavit, prepared on October 17, 2006, he recalled that: By the time I reachedmy first stop in England, both my feet [and] legs were affected. During businessmeetings in India, I began to experience tremors in my limbs, cognitivememory/speech problems, and coordination difficulties. Prior to returning homefrom the two-week trip, my arms were also affected. The symptoms now includednot only numbness and tingling but also sharp, shooting, burning, and throbbingpain. I managed to complete the trip in defiance of significant pain. Once home,the pain continued. I experienced numbness in both of my hands and legs and hadspasms in my back.Petitioner underwent imaging of his spine on July 6, 1999. The MRI of hiscervical spine produced an impression of early disc degeneration withoutextrusion. The MRI of his lumbar spine was normal.On July 9, 1999, three days after his spinal MRIs, petitioner returned to hisprimary care provider. He complained of flu-like symptoms and of continuednumbness in his right leg. Although the office notes reflect a history ofnumbness in petitioner left leg and hands, only a general time frame of symptomonset is specified (petitioner reporting, during a visit to his primary carephysician on October 27, 1999, that his numbness had progressed to all of hisextremities in late June). The diagnostic impression at the July 9, 1999 visitwas sinusitis and strain in the lumbar and cervical regions of the spine. Theexamining physician prescribed Lorabid and Xanax and ordered physical therapy.Treatment Sought During the First Six Months after the Hepatitis B VaccinationFive weeks later, on August 18, 1999, petitioner visited Samuel Jorgenson, M.D.,an orthopedist. Petitioner reported a two-month history of right foot pain andintermittent numbness and tingling in his arms, hands, and feet. Petitioner alsoreported that he did not continue to take the Xanax he had been prescribedbecause it caused drowsiness. Dr. Jorgenson’s physical examination revealed adecreased sensation to sharp pin prick in petitioner’s right foot when comparedwith his left one. It was the orthopedist’s assessment that petitioner had apossible entrapment neuropathy in his lower right extremity. Lorabid is anantibiotic indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate infections.Dr. Jorgenson referred petitioner for an electromyogram that was conducted onSeptember 2, 1999. The electromyogram (or EMG) revealed no evidence of acute orchronic lumbosacral radiculopathy, plexopathy or peripheral neuropathy.Petitioner had described symptoms of progressive burning pain and intermittentnumbness from his foot to his ankle that, at times, emanated to his knee. Thephysician interpreting the EMG results noted that the patient was most likelyexhibiting very early symptoms of idiopathic peripheral neuropathy andrecommended a trial of Neurontin to reduce the burning parasthesias.Approximately two months later, on November 9, 1999, petitioner saw Janet Lin, aneurologist, on referral from Dr. Roberts, his primary care physician. Dr. Linnoted that petitioner’s neurologic exam was normal except for some minimalsensory abnormalities in his hands and feet. Although petitioner reportedfeeling fatigued, there was no evidence of muscle weakness. Dr. Lin believedthat petitioner was suffering a post-inflammatory neuropathy related toimmunizations. During her examination nearly five months after petitionerreceived the subject vaccination, Dr. Lin surmised that the culprit might be theHepatitis B immunization that petitioner received because petitioner hadreceived all the other immunizations previously.Treatment Sought Over the Next Two YearsPetitioner sought treatment from a variety of specialists over the next twoyears. An electromyogram (or EMG) is a test that is used to record theelectrical activity of muscles. When muscles are active, they produce anelectrical current. This current is usually proportional to the level of themuscle activity. . . . EMGs can be used to detect abnormal electrical activityof muscle that can occur in many diseases and conditions, including . . .inflammation of muscles, pinched nerves, [and] peripheral nerve damage (damageto nerves in the arms and legs).On referral from his primary care doctor, petitioner consulted on February 28,2000 with Benedict Villanueva, M.D., an infectious disease specialist. Asreflected in the notes from the consultation, Dr. Roberts had referredpetitioner to Dr. Villanueva for an evaluation of whether his symptoms ofdiffuse sensory neuropathy were a possible post vaccine adverse reaction. Theparticular vaccine under examination was the polio vaccine—not the Hepatitis Bvaccine—that petitioner had received in June 1999. Dr. Villanueva noted thatpetitioner had a normal EMG, a basically normal MRI of his cervical and lumbararea and, with the exception of a slightly elevated protein level, a normalspinal tap. In Dr. Villanueva’s assessment, among the possible etiologies forpetitioner’s subjective diffuse sensory polyneuropathy would be a rare/remoteadverse reaction to the polio vaccine. But, Dr. Villanueva observed, suchreactions occur within a few weeks after immunization and, to his knowledge, donot last for several months after the inoculation.Approximately one month later, petitioner underwent further neurologicexamination by Catherine Lomen-Hoerth, M.D., at the University of California inSan Francisco. He returned to Dr. Lomen-Hoerth on May 10, 2000, for a follow-upof continuing pain and numbness. Dr. Lomen-Hoerth noted that petitioner’sdiscomfort had progressed and was worse than when she had examined him for thefirst time one month earlier. It was Dr. Lomen-Hoerth’s impression thatpetitioner had a progressive small fiber neuropathy rather than a staticneuropathy related to his vaccinations last summer.On referral from his neurologist Dr. Lomen-Hoerth, petitioner saw David Martin,M.D., a rheumatologist, on July 31, 2000. The purpose of the referral was toevaluate petitioner’s severe fatigue, weight loss, intermittent burning rash onboth arms and joint pain. It was Dr. Martin’s impression that extensivelaboratory work and physical examination failed to produce any clear evidence ofconnective tissue disease. In his view, petitioner suffered from an idiopathicsyndrome associated with chronic fatigue and . . . possibly related to a vaccineexposure or possibly a toxin. Dr. Martin suspected that petitioner’s conditionhad an underlying psychiatric component with possible depression.On referral from Dr. Lomen-Hoerth, petitioner was examined by NicholasMaragakis, M.D., a neurologist at John Hopkins Hospital on August 21, 2000, forevaluation of a possible small fiber neuropathy. Dr. Maragakis spinal tap orcerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination that yields an elevated protein level maybe indicative of an underlying infectious or inflammatory process. Noted thatpetitioner’s “exam [was] normal, with the exception of some mild decreasedpinprick sensation in the hands and feet, which is often typical for a smallfiber neuropathy. Of note, quantitative sensory testing at an outside hospitalwas essentially normal. I think this most likely represents some form of smallfiber neuropathy.” In an addendum to his August 21, 2000 report, Dr. Maragakisnoted that petitioner’s skin biopsy “demonstrated a normal range of epidermalnerve fiber density;” however, he found the biopsy was “suggestive of earlynerve fiber degeneration” and that a later biopsy “may be useful.”Over four months later, on January 3, 2001, petitioner presented to theemergency room acting strange and confused and complaining of worsening pain inhis extremities. The admission notes indicate that petitioner has a neuropathiccondition that has waxed and waned, but is slowly progressive. The admissionnotes also indicated that petitioner had experienced some changes in mentalstatus, including poor memory, decreased alertness, and diminishedconcentration. The diagnosis on discharge was acute severe exacerbation ofchronic neuropathy pain.On May 8, 2001, petitioner saw Rex Chiu, M.D., an internist at Stanford Hospitaland Clinics, on referral from Dr. Lomen-Hoerth. Dr. Chiu noted that petitionerexperienced an onset of numbness and tingling in his left toe six days afterreceiving a polio vaccination and a Hepatitis B vaccination in anticipation ofbusiness travel to India. Petitioner’s developing symptoms produced a concernfor a post-inflammatory reaction to the immunizations, but a trial course ofprednisone provided no relief. Following a series of visits to diverse medicalspecialists, the consensus diagnosis appears to be small fiber neuropathy. Dr.Chiu wrote that because petitioner’s neurologic changes seem to have arisenafter his immunization in 1999, there is question as to whether there is sometype of autoimmune or other reaction to this vaccination, which may now beworsening in a progressive fashion. Dr. Chiu noted: The patient is Hepatitis Bnegative, referring to the lack of Hepatitis B antibodies that might be expectedto appear. Dr. Chiu planned to refer petitioner for further neurologic andrheumatologic examination at Stanford.On referral from Dr. Chiu, Yuen So, M.D., a neurologist at Stanford, examinedpetitioner on July 12, 2001. Dr. So noted that petitioner had seen a number ofneurologists over a two-year period. Dr. So further noted that the mostdisabling feature of petitioner’s illness was his diffuse pain. Based on aphysical examination of petitioner and a review of petitioner’s laboratory testresults, Dr. So wrote: It is conceivable that [petitioner] had an acute,predominantly sensory polyneuropathy back in 1999. But without the records ofpetitioner’s medical evaluation during that time period, Dr. So found itdifficult to ascribe petitioner’s complaint of progressive symptoms since 1999to the received vaccinations. Disturbing to Dr. So about petitioner’s conditionwas the a very diverse nature of petitioner’s symptoms.Also disturbing to Dr. So was the lack of objective evidence of neuropathicabnormality in a patient who has had ongoing disease for a course of two years.Contrary to normal expectations for a patient suspected of having a prior acuteneuropathy, petitioner did not demonstrate a slow and steady course ofimprovement. Dr. So described the case as a very difficult one to diagnose andto treat.In September 2001, petitioner and his wife moved from northern California toDelaware. Approximately two months later, on November 8, 2001, petitionervisited Gail Berkenblit, M.D., an internist at Johns Hopkins, for ongoingchronic pain. Dr. Berkenblit conducted a physical examination and reviewed therecords that petitioner presented regarding his extensive laboratory work. Dr.Berkenblit took an extensive patient history and noted that petitioner’sevaluations have been essentially normal, including his autonomic functiontesting. Petitioner’s initial diagnosis was a possible post inflammatoryneuropathy. Subsequently, petitioner received evaluations for a possible smallfiber neuropathy. Repeated testing, however, had not disclosed any definiteevidence of a small fiber neuropathy. Rather, swelling noticed in the distal legsites during a neurologic examination at Johns Hopkins by Dr. Nicholas Maragakiswas suggestive of early possible nerve fiber degeneration. During the officevisit, Dr. Berkenblit addressed concerns expressed by petitioner and his wifethat petitioner’s symptoms resulted from his Hepatitis B vaccination. Dr.Berkenblit observed that there is no clear link between Hepatitis B vaccinationand progressive neuropathic pain, but noted that if petitioner did developsymptoms of a sensory neuropathy as a consequence of the vaccine, it would mostlikely be as an autoimmune type mechanism and not a vaccine contamination issueas petitioner’s wife speculated.Petitioner filed his vaccine claim on December 20, 2001.On January 15, 2002, a second skin biopsy was taken from several differentplaces on petitioner’s leg. The test result again showed a normal range ofepidermal nerve fiber density, offering “no definitive evidence” of a smallfiber neuropathy and “no clear progression compared to the August 2000biopsies.”Three weeks later, on February 7, 2002, petitioner visited Lee Dresser, M.D., aneurologist, for an evaluation. Dr. Dresser noted that previous evaluations byneurologists included an assumption that petitioner had developed a sensoryneuropathy as a response to his vaccination but that diagnosis was modified asextensive testing has returned negative results. It was Dr. Dresser’s impressionthat petitioner suffers from diffuse dysesthetic pain following remotevaccinations. Of interest to Dr. Dresser was the finding of a mild elevation ofpetitioner’s spinal fluid protein following petitioner’s extensive and otherwiseunremarkable testing. Dr. Dresser observed that petitioner’s symptoms wereessentially 100% subjective with no significant objective findings on . . .testing or examination. Dr. Dresser found petitioner’s case to be a verycomplicated one.Opinions of Possible Vaccine-Related CausationTo assist petitioner with his pending vaccine claim, Dr. Roberts, the primarycare physician who examined petitioner when his symptoms first began in 1999,wrote a letter dated February 13, 2002. Dr. Roberts stated that petitioner hadno significant neurologic symptoms prior to the petitioner’s receipt of theHepatitis B vaccination and that petitioner began to develop neurologiccomplaints shortly after his immunization. Id. It was Dr. Roberts’ belief thatthe temporal relationship between the received vaccination and the onset ofpetitioner’s symptoms strongly correlated with the hypothesis that the symptomswere caused by the vaccination. Thereafter, other treating doctors offered viewsabout what may have caused petitioner’s symptoms.On January 21, 2003, Robert Allen, M.D., an evaluator retained by the defense inconnection with the worker’s compensation claim filed by petitioner, examinedpetitioner.Dr. Allen observed that petitioner’s neurologic evaluations (including biopsies)have not documented any progressive neurologic disease. In Dr. Allen’s opinion,petitioner’s clinical history and physical examination, together with theextensive objective work-up, suggested a diagnosis of fibromyalgia. He explainedthat the diagnosis of fibromyalgia involves the presence of widespreadmusculoskeletal pain, as well as multiple tender points . . . that occur bothabove and below the waist. He stated that the etiology of his fibromyalgiaremains unclear and may have developed as a result of the June 1999vaccinations. But, Dr. Allen acknowledged, such causation is impossible toconfirm or deny. Dr. Allen was one of two evaluators to diagnose petitioner withfibromyalgia, a diagnosis that is disputed by petitioner’s treating physicians.The diagnosis of fibromyalgia was first considered by the defense evaluator, Dr.Robert Allen. Another defense evaluator, Dr. Charles Skomer, diagnosed a chronicpain condition but allowed that petitioner’s symptoms were possibly consistentwith a finding of fibromyalgia. But, there is no evidence in either the multipleneurologic or rheumatologic evaluations contained in petitioner’s medicalrecords.On April 29, 2003, Harold Buttram, M.D., an internist with Woodlands HealingResearch Center, examined petitioner. Dr. Buttram noted that petitioner hadbecome ill following chelation efforts to eliminate mercury, and subsequenttesting indicated that mercury toxicity was not an issue for petitioner. Dr.Buttram further noted that Dr. Tenpenny, the treating physician who testified atthe first hearing on petitioner’s behalf, had directed petitioner’s mercurydetoxicification process. Aware that petitioner’s vaccine claim was pending, Dr.Buttram wrote: “For the records, it is my opinion that the patient’s peripheralneuropathy is directly related to (was caused by) a series of two Hepatitis Bvaccines.” Noting that petitioner Aha[d] been diagnosed by neurologists ashaving chronic neuropathic pain, Dr. Buttram prepared an opinion letter datedJune 6, 2003, stating that he agreed with the diagnosis of the neurologists andreiterating that petitioner’s condition was caused by a series of Hepatitis Bvaccines.On November 4, 2004, petitioner was given a diagnosis of “vaccine-inducedneuroimmune dysfunction” by Vincent Natali, M.D., a general practitioner.Thereafter, on December 23, 2004, David Waldman, M.D., another physician, issuedan extensive report concerning petitioner’s disability status. Dr. Waldman’sreport was informed by his review of petitioner’s medical records, his review ofmedical literature, and a physical examination of petitioner.Contained in Dr. Waldman’s report was a detailed, chronological summary ofpetitioner’s medical evaluations and laboratory results. Also contained in Dr.Waldman’s report was a summary of medical articles that he had reviewed, inconnection with his evaluation of petitioner, concerning complications from theHepatitis B vaccination. Dr. Waldman concluded there is no evidence within therecords submitted that, prior to 6/11/99, Mr. Shaw had any neurological injuryand was not able to function. . . . After the vaccinations of 6/11/99, Mr. Shawbegan a very complex medical history, resulting in a chronic pain disordersyndrome. . . . Mr. Shaw has a problem with pain medicine addiction, which hedid not have prior to his industrial injury. As stated within his multiplemedical records, as a consequence of his work related chronic pain disorder, hehas developed a drug dependence. . . . There is no evidence in review of themedical records that Mr. Shaw has a fibromyalgia syndrome. . . . Rather, Mr.Shaw has developed a chronic neuropathic pain syndrome. Although the exactetiology has not been determined, based on the review of the medical records andmedical literature, it is with medical probability that this syndrome was aconsequence of the vaccinations received on 6/11/99. This opinion that thissyndrome occurred post vaccination has also been supported by multiple clinicalevaluators . . . including Dr. Janet Lin and Dr. [Catherine] Lomen-Hoerth [twoneurologists] at UCSF Medical Center. This has also been supported by recentevaluations which Mr. Shaw has sought to obtain relief from his pain syndrome .. . with multiple sequela, including drug dependence, and these conditions areindustrial in nature.Pamela P. Palmer, M.D., an anesthesiologist at the UCSF Medical Center’s PainManagement Center, examined petitioner nearly nine months later on September 20,2005. Dr. Palmer assessed petitioner as “a 46 year-old gentleman with six yearsof diffuse pain after vaccination, consistent with a diffuse small fiberneuropathy.”Four months later, on January 30, 2006, petitioner was evaluated by Phyllis A.Cullen, M.D., an anesthesiologist and pain specialist with the Chico Pain Clinicin Chico, California. Dr. Cullen reported petitioner’s history as that of “a 46year old man who suffered an intense reaction to a Hepatitis B vaccine in 1999,developing a small fiber neuropathy.” Dr. Cullen’s impression after examiningpetitioner was that he had a “small fiber neuropathy.”Thereafter, Robert E. Sullivan, M.D., who prescribed petitioner’s medicinalcannabis, found on February 13, 2007, that petitioner’s “chronic polyneuropathypersists, secondary to a Hepatitis B adverse reaction.”Petitioner testified at the 2008 hearing for his vaccine claim that he continuedto experience fluctuating levels of pain. His pain is best managed by the opiatetherapy he has been prescribed. A neuropsychologic evaluation was subsequentlyconducted by Alfred L. Scopp, Ph.D., at the request of petitioner’s disabilityattorney. In a lengthy report dated June 25, 2008, Dr. Scopp concluded thatpetitioner suffered from a “progressive peripheral neuropathy subsequent toHepatitis B inoculation.”On August 7, 2008, petitioner was seen by Oscar N. Abeliuk, M.D., a neurologistfor a comprehensive neurologic consultation in connection with his disabilityclaim. Dr. Abeliuk prepared a lengthy report, in which he determined thatpetitioner suffered from a “decreased perception of pinprick and light touch ina symmetrical distribution in the upper and lower extremities distally,suggestive of long-term polyneuropathy (in this case, small fiber type).” Dr.Abeliuk offered as a diagnosis, “chronic debilitating polyneuropathy, welldocumented by multiple tests. Doctor Lomen-Hoerth has determined the presence ofsmall fiber polyneuropathy affecting the upper and lower extremities, asdocumented by a skin biopsy at Johns Hopkins, with disturbing skin sensations.”On May 18, 2009, petitioner was seen by Joel M. Rothfeld, Ph.D, M.D., for aneurologic consultation. In Dr. Rothfeld’s assessment, petitioner has a “historyof distal small fiber neuropathy with chronic pain refractory to multiplemedication therapies.” Dr. Rothfeld found that petitioner’s “neurolgical examrevealed alodynic response to sensory testing distal lower extremitiesconsistent with small fiber neuropathy neuropathic pain.”Petitioner appears to have remained under the care of his primary treatingneurologist, Dr. Catherine Lomen-Hoerth. Dr. Lomen-Hoerth found after herexamination of petitioner on August 26, 2009, that clinically [petitioner]appears to have a progressive small fiber neuropathy, with documentation on skinbiopsy suggestive of an early small fiber neuropathy. These type of neuropathiestypically have normal nerve conduction studies and normal neuroimaging, as wasthe case with Mr. Shaw. . . . He is unable to work due to an inability to standor sit for any period of time and has an inability to type well due to numbnessand pain.In a letter dated November 14, 2009 to Cigna Disability Claims department, Dr.Pamela P. Palmer, the anesthesiologist who continued to treat petitioner forpain, noted that he suffers from “a clearly diagnosed small-fiber neuropathy”and urged that his disability benefits be reinstated. Likewise, his primary carephysician, Katherine Julian, M.D., wrote a letter requesting reinstatement ofpetitioner’s disability benefits. Dr. Julian explained that “it is unclear as tothe . . . etiology of his neuropathy, though specialists believe the cause islikely due to a vaccine he received in the late 1990’s. . . . However, he hasbeen evaluated by neurology, and standard office-based nerve testing does revealneuropathy.”APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARDSThe Vaccine Act provides two separate methods by which to obtain Programcompensation: (1) Vaccine Injury Table (Table) claims; and (2) causation in fact(off-Table) claims. When asserting a Table claim, a claimant is afforded apresumption of causation if he shows that he received a vaccine listed on theTable and suffered an injury listed on the Table within the prescribed timeperiod. If unable to establish a Table claim, the claimant must show that hisinjury was caused in fact by the vaccine he received.The Vaccine Act provides for the compensation of any illness, disability,injury, or condition not set forth in the Vaccine Injury Table but which wascaused by a vaccine covered under the Program. The Act does not require apetitioner bringing a non-Table claim to categorize the suffered injury. Rather,a petitioner is required only to show that the vaccine in question causedinjury-regardless of the ultimate diagnosis. When, as in this case, theconditions at issue present with many of the same symptoms—but the underlyingcauses and required treatments are different—and when, as in this case, theevidence for causation depends on the particular diagnosis of petitioner’scondition, a special master may consider whether the record supports thediagnosis proposed by petitioner. A petitioner may prove entitlement to Programcompensation of an off-Table case by satisfying the three-part test set forth bythe Federal Circuit in Althen v. Secretary of Health & Human Services. Conciselystated, a claimant’s burden is to show by preponderant evidence that thevaccination brought about [his] injury by providing: (1) a medical theorycausally connecting the vaccination and the injury; (2) a logical sequence ofcause and effect showing that the vaccination was the reason for the injury; and(3) a showing of a proximate temporal relationship between vaccination andinjury. If a claimant satisfies this burden, he is entitled to recover unlessthe government shows, also by a preponderance of evidence, that the injury wasin fact caused by factors unrelated to the vaccine. To prevail, a claimant’stheory of causation must be supported by a reputable medical or scientificexplanation. A claimant need not produce medical literature or epidemiologicevidence in support of his theory causation, but if such evidence is submitted,a special master may consider the scientific soundness of that evidence inreaching an informed judgment as to whether a particular vaccination more likelythan not caused a particular injury.While Althen contemplates that the provided support for a claimant’s theory ofcausation is based on a reputable medical or scientific explanation, thatsupport need not rise to the level of medical or scientific certainty for apetitioner to prevail on a vaccine claim. In Andreu, the Federal Circuit madeclear that submitted medical literature and epidemiologic evidence must beviewed, however, not through the lens of the laboratorian, but instead from thevantage point of the Vaccine Act’s preponderant evidence standard: “The standardof proof required by the [Vaccine] Act is simple preponderance of evidence; notscientific certainty. . . . [I]t is not plaintiff’s burden to disprove everypossible ground of causation suggested by defendant nor must the findings of thecourt meet the standards of the laboratorian.”When reviewing offered scientific evidence, a special master must take intoaccount that a finding of causation in the medical community may require a muchhigher level of certainty than that required by the Vaccine Act to establish aprima facie case. Also reiterated in Andreu is the importance in vaccine casesof considering medical opinions contained in the records or presented at hearingtestimony. Such opinions, explained the Circuit Court, can be quite probativesince treating physicians are likely to be in the best position to determinewhether a logical sequence of cause and effect show[s] that the vaccination wasthe reason for the injury. However, consistent with the Vaccine Act, a specialmaster is not bound by any diagnosis, conclusion, judgment, test result, report,or summary contained in the record. A special master must consider the entirerecord and the course of the subject injury when evaluating the weight to beafforded to any offered diagnosis, conclusion, judgment, test result, report, orsummary contained in the record.ANALYSISOpinion of Petitioner’s Expert Witness, Dr. MorganIn support of his vaccine claim, on remand, Mr. Shaw relies on the opinions ofthe treating physicians contained in his filed medical records, as well as theoffered expert report and remand hearing testimony of Dr. Morgan. Havingobtained a medical degree from Meharry Medical College in 1970, Dr. Morgan isboard-certified by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, as well as bythe American Board of Independent Medical Examiners. Dr. Morgan is a practicingneurologist, whose focus is neurologic injury and disability. Dr. Morgan is alsoan Assistant Professor at Brown University, School of Medicine in the Departmentof Clinical Neuroscience.It is Dr. Morgan’s opinion, based on the evaluations of petitioner’s treatingphysicians, the medical records, the medical literature, as well as his ownexpertise, that Mr. Shaw suffers from a small fiber neuropathy. It is thefurther position of Dr. Morgan that petitioner’s injury resulted from ademyelination of his peripheral nerves through the biological mechanism ofmolecular mimicry caused by the Hepatitis B vaccines he received. This theory ofcausation contemplates that the administered “vaccine stimulates the host’simmune system to react to the Hepatitis B antigen and cross react with themyelinated nerve fibers of the host. This mistaken attack by the body’s ownimmune system is secondary to the similarity between the foreign Hepatitis Bantigen and the myelin component in the host.” In sum, Dr. Morgan posits thatthe Hepatitis B vaccine can cause demyelination of the peripheral nerves, id.,and a finding that petitioner suffers from “a small fiber neuropathy causallyrelated to a post-vaccinal immune mediated peripheral nerve disorder,” issupported by the “time of symptom onset.”Opinion of Respondent’s Expert Witness, Dr. LeistTo address the opinion offered by Dr. Morgan, respondent offered the opinion andtestimony of Dr. Leist, who serves as Chief of the Division of Neuroimmunologyand Director of the Comprehensive Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Center at ThomasJefferson University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Possessing a doctorate inbiochemistry from the University of Zurich in 1985 and a medical degree from theUniversity of Miami in 1993, Dr. Leist augmented his studies by pursuingpostgraduate training in the areas of pathology, microbiology, immunology andneurology. Board-certified by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology anddescribing himself as a bench-trained immunologist with strong interests ingeneral immunology and viral immunology, he has focused, through his training,on diseases that are immunologic in nature and affect the nervous system.Dr. Leist takes issue with Dr. Morgan’s opinion. Dr. Leist notes as an initialmatter, that Mr. Shaw has had two skin biopsies performed to evaluate whether hehas a small fiber neuropathy. In both instances, the biopsies exhibited “normalepidermal nerve fiber density”—a result that did not support a finding thatpetitioner suffer from a small fiber neuropathy. Leist further notes thatneither the MRIs or the electrophysiologic studies that were performed for Mr.Shaw, after the vaccinations at issue, showed evidence of a demyelinating orinflammatory process in the peripheral or central nervous system. Additionalevidence that in Dr. Leist’s view diminishes the likelihood that petitioner’sinjury is vaccine-related is the negative result of the test conducted forantibodies against the Hepatitis B vaccine on September 26, 2001.That negativefinding, according to Dr. Leist, indicates that petitioner’s Hepatitis Bvaccination did not result in the type of T-cell response necessary toprecipitate demyelination.Evaluating Whether Petitioner Suffers a Small Fiber NeuropathyAmong the issues to be resolved is whether petitioner suffers from a small fiberneuropathy. For the reasons discussed below the undersigned is persuaded thatpetitioner more likely than not suffers from a small fiber neuropathy. Athearing, petitioner’s expert, Dr. Morgan, provided the following backgroundinformation concerning small fiber neuropathy. He explained that a small fiberneuropathy is a syndrome that “primarily involves the sensory nerves.” Heelaborated that a “hallmark” of this condition are both “positive” and“negative” symptoms. Id. Positive symptoms are sharp pains and involve themyelinated Alpha Delta fibers; in contrast, negative symptoms are numbness andinvolve the unmyelinated C fibers. He testified that “small nerve fibers arenerves that are made up of both unmyelinated fibers, called C fibers; and . . .myelinated fibers called Alpha Delta fibers” which are “thinly myelinated.” Themedical records indicate that Mr. Shaw began to experience both the positivesymptom of “pins and needles” and the negative symptom of “some numbness,”approximately six days after his June 11, 1999 Hepatitis B immunization—asreported to his treating physician (noting that his numbness began on June 17,1999, four days prior to his visit to Dr. Roberts and six days after he receivedhis second Hepatitis B vaccine, and that numbness was “progressing to athrobbing pain”).Petitioner experienced the symptoms in his hands and feet (“glove andstocking”). According to Dr. Morgan, the numbness in all four limbs reported topetitioner’s orthopedic surgeon was a negative symptom involving theunmyelinated C fibers. Contrastingly, the reported “shooting pain in the limbswith throbbing” was a positive symptom implicating the myelinated fibers.” Dr.Morgan’s testimony explaining the symptoms of small nerve fiber dysfunction wasconsistent with petitioner’s filed medical literature.Petitioner’s Laboratory Tests: Dr. Morgan addressed petitioner’s various medicaltests and the test results, asserting that they supported or, at least, did notcontradict a diagnosis of small fiber neuropathy. Referring to petitioner’s skinbiopsies, Dr. Morgan explained that petitioner’s early test results showed a“normal range of epidermal nerve fiber density,” but when considered with hisother skin biopsy results, revealed abnormality. Dr. Morgan testified thatpetitioner’s treater, Dr. Maragakis, determined from petitioner’s first skinbiopsy that the “nerve swellings . . . could be the beginning of a nervedegeneration” (addendum to August 21, 2000 report of Dr. Maragakis discussingthe results of petitioner’s first skin biopsy). Because petitioner’s symptomsdid not improve, but progressively worsened after that biopsy, Dr. Lomen-Hoerth,petitioner’s treating neurologist, recommended repeating the skin biopsy. Thesecond skin biopsy was taken from several different places on petitioner’s leg,including she proximal thigh, his distal thigh, and his distal leg. The testresult again showed a normal range of epidermal nerve fiber density offering “nodefinitive skin biopsy is considered the best method for diagnosing a smallfiber neuropathy.” A skin biopsy will report an abnormal result in 67% of smallfiber neuropathy cases. Dr. Morgan testified, however, that the result was “notnormal” at the proximal thigh location because petitioner’s “nerve fiberdistribution was borderline” normal with a patchy distribution and that some ofthe examined fibers were “fragmented and contained small swellings.” Similarlyat the distal leg the nerve fiber “distribution again is patchy.” In Dr.Morgan’s opinion, this “patchy” distribution of nerve fiber cells is consistentwith a small fiber neuropathy. Dr. Morgan also addressed the findings ofpetitioner’s EMG and nerve conduction exams which were documented as normal. Dr.Morgan explained that an abnormal EMG requires “some involvement of the . . .ventral nerve root,” but because small fiber neuropathy “doesn’t involve theventral nerve root that supplies motor fibers,” an EMG would not showabnormality.Dr. Morgan also discussed petitioner’s conduction study. Dr. Morgan offeredthat: Sensory nerve conduction, which is a little more sensitive than motornerve . . . measures more . . . heavily myelinated fibers. And if that processis spared, you won’t see abnormalities on the nerve conduction and the nerveconduction velocities will be normal, particularly the sensory nerveconductions. And so . . . the nerve conduction study just further supports thatthis petitioner’s injury involves . . . small fibers, both myelinated andunmyelinated. Dr. Morgan further offered that small fiber sensory neuropathydoes not involve sufficient heavily myelinated fibers to “create abnormalitiesin the nerve conduction testing.” He added that “if there is too muchinvolvement of the heavily myelinated fibers,” the condition no longer fallswithin small fiber neuropathy category.” Petitioner’s treating neurologist, Dr.Lomen-Hoerth, commented, in her notes that petitioner’s “normal nerveconduction” studies “do not exclude a small fiber neuropathy.” Theelectromyographer, Dr. James Wei, who reviewed the nerve conduction studiesagreed with Dr. Lomen-Hoerth.The filed medical literature confirms the difficulty described by Dr. Morgan indiagnosing a small fiber neuropathy. As observed in the 2002 Lacomis article,small-fiber neuropathy is a “commonly encountered disorder” that is “frustratingto clinicians because of difficulties in proving the diagnosis and intreatment.” Consistent with Dr. Morgan’s testimony, Lacomis observed that to theextent routine nerve conduction studies assess large-fiber function, they aregenerally normal.” Lacomis also states that although “heart variability can beassessed on some EMG equipment . . . it is likely that the subtle abnormalitiesassociated with most small-fiber neuropathies will not be detected.”Respondent’s expert Dr. Leist is not persuaded that petitioner suffers from asmall fiber neuropathy. In his view, petitioner’s test results—particularly theskin biopsies—provide evidence that “weighs against” a small fiber neuropathydiagnosis. Dr. Leist opines, “I would expect that if somebody has progressivesymptoms over a period of time, that there would be evidence of a progressiveunderlying dysfunction. . . . would I expect . . . an objectifiable finding of,for example, nerve loss over the one and a half or two years between the twoskin biopsies? Yes, I would expect this. The fact that it’s not there, I wouldconsider as less usual. . . .The fact that it doesn’t show abnormality clearlydoesn’t support a finding of small fiber neuropathy.”The Opinions of Petitioner’s Treating Doctors: Dr. Morgan also relied on theopinions of petitioner’s treating physicians who variously considered a smallfiber neuropathy diagnosis. Petitioner’s doctors recorded different impressionsabout the precise nature of his injury. What is consistently reported, however,is a condition involving a progressive and chronic pain syndrome. After acareful review of petitioner’s records and the expert testimony, the undersignedis persuaded that it is more likely than not that petitioner suffers from asmall fiber neuropathy. Interpretation of the EMG results in September of 1999:The patient is most likely exhibiting very early symptoms of idiopathicperipheral neuropathy. Dr. Lin indicating that petitioner was suffering apost-inflammatory neuropathy related to immunizations. Dr. Villanueva discussingpetitioner’s subjective diffuse sensory polyneuropathy. Dr. Lomen-Hoerth’simpression in May of 2000 that petitioner had a progressive small fiberneuropathy. Dr. Maragakis’s view that “this most likely represents some form ofsmall fiber neuropathy.” Dr. So opining in July 2001: It is conceivable thatpetitioner had an acute, predominantly sensory polyneuropathy back in 1999. Dr.Waldman finding in December 2004 that “Mr. Shaw has developed a chronicneuropathic pain syndrome.” Dr. Cullen’s reported patient’s history as that of“a 46 year old man who suffered an intense reaction to a Hepatitis B vaccine in1999, developing a small fiber neuropathy.” Dr. Palmer describing petitioner as“a 46 year-old gentleman with six years of diffuse pain after vaccination,consistent with a diffuse small fiber neuropathy.” Dr. Robert Sullivan findingin February 2007 that petitioner’s “chronic polyneuropathy persists.” Dr. AlfredScopp indicating that petitioner has an Axis III diagnosis of peripheralneuropathy.” Dr. Oscar Abeliuk found petitioner’s condition to be “suggestive oflong-term polyneuropathy (in this case, small fiber type).” Dr. Rothfeld’sassessment that petitioner has a “history of and current neurologic responsesconsistent with small fiber neuropathy with chronic pain.” Petitioner’s primarytreating neurologist, Dr. Lomen-Hoerth, finding again in August 2009 that“clinically petitioner appears to have a progressive small fiber neuropathy,with documentation on skin biopsy suggestive of an early small fiberneuropathy.” In November of 2009, Dr. Palmer, who treated petitioner for pain,noting that he suffers from “a clearly diagnosed small-fiber neuropathy.”It is true—as respondent points out, see Respondent’s Post-Hearing Brief onRemand filed November 17, 2010, that many of petitioner’s treating physiciansdid not make a definitive diagnosis of small fiber neuropathy. But, it is thisdiagnosis that his various treaters and evaluations most frequently consideredbased chiefly on petitioner’s neurologic responses. Recognizing that the“objective” tests and studies do not clearly demonstrate or negate a diagnosisof small fiber neuropathy, the undersigned is persuaded that petitioner’sclinical presentation (as reflected in the medical records), the opinions ofpetitioner’s treating physicians, the expert opinion of Dr. Morgan and the citedmedical literature adequately support such a finding. While the undersignedcannot find with medical certainty that petitioner suffers from a small fiberneuropathy, the undersigned does find that more likely than not petitioner isafflicted with this condition, and the undersigned is mindful that “the standardof proof required by the Vaccine Act is simple preponderance of evidence; notscientific certainty.” The undersigned notes that Dr. Maragakis later indicatedthat he could not “make a diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy based on any of thebased on any of the studies” performed.Evaluating Petitioner’s Claim under the Althen ProngsAs stated earlier, petitioner must prove causation by showing: (1) a medicaltheory causally connecting the vaccination and the injury; (2) a logicalsequence of cause and effect showing the vaccination was the reason for theinjury; and (3) a proximate temporal relationship between the vaccination andthe injury. The undersigned addresses each of the prongs of the Althen standardin turn. For ease of discussion, the undersigned addresses the first and thethird prongs of the Althen before turning to the second prong.Petitioner’s Offered Medical Theory: Petitioner must offer a medical theorycausally connecting the vaccination and the injury. As discussed above, Dr.Morgan opined in his written report that petitioner’s small fiber neuropathyresulted from his Hepatitis B vaccine causing a demyelination of his peripheralnerves through a biological mechanism of molecular mimicry. This theorycontemplates that the “vaccine stimulates the host[’s] immune system to react tothe Hepatitis B antigen and cross react with the myelinated nerve fibers of thehost. . . . This mistaken attack by the body’s own immune system is secondary tothe similarity between the foreign Hepatitis B antigen and the myelin componentin the host.”At hearing, Dr. Morgan explained his theory of molecular mimicry as follows: Itstarts at the dorsal root ganglion and that ganglion has unmyelinated,myelinated, heavily myelinated fibers. There is an antigen antibody reactionthat occurs there, disrupts the myelin and is reflected in the peripheral nerveand small fibers, specifically involving both the alpha thinly myelinated fibersand the unmyelinated C fibers. And that is caused by an immune mechanism whichis the antigen from the vaccine that looks at the normal self myelin, crossreacts with it, and causes this initial inflammatory reaction. And which thenleads to the gradual demyelination affecting the nerve roots, which then accountfor the person’s—for Mr. Shaw’s—symptoms. Dr. Morgan pointed to Petitioner’sTrial Exhibit Number 5 to further describe this mechanism: And so you could seewhere if someone got an inflammatory demyelinative reaction, how the secondaryeffects would affect both . . . the unmyelinated fiber, which is the C fiber,which is what we see with small fiber neuropathy; but it also affects the thinlymyelinated fiber, which also is part of small fiber neuropathy. And there’s somesuggestion that it actually affects some of even the heavier myelinated fibersbut not much. If it does, then it becomes no longer a small fiber neuropathy. .. . So it’s a complex understanding of it, but I think it explains why thesethings aren’t just black and white . . . it’s not one root, one root andeverything is nicely fit. That’s why these syndromes are called syndromes. Andthey overlap.Dr. Morgan testified that inflammatory cells have likewise been observed, fromautopsy slides, in the dorsal root ganglion of patients with Guillain-Barrésyndrome. Dr. Morgan offered evidence supporting petitioner’s theory, thatmolecular mimicry can cause “a post-vaccinal type of neuropathy,” in the form ofmedical literature. Specifically, the Lacomis article notes that “in somepatients with idiopathic small-fiber neuropathy, an inflammatory autoimmunebasis has been hypothesized, and circumstantial evidence is available.” Lacomisgoes on to discuss this evidence, concluding: “Thus, there is evidence thatsuggests, but does not prove, that infections or autoimmune processes may causesmall-fiber neuropathy. Unfortunately, there are no good laboratory markers ofthis autoimmune process.”But, Dr. Leist took issue with the lack of evidence that the Hepatitis Bvaccination can harm unmyelinated C fibers, and was not persuaded by Dr.Morgan’s explanation that the unmyelinated C fibers experience secondary effectsor bystander effects from the post vaccinal inflammatory demyelinative reaction.At the first hearing in this case, Dr. Leist conceded that it is “potentiallypossible” that the Hepatitis B vaccine can cause auto-immune reactions. Inmaking this statement, Dr. Leist indicated that he was relying upon “the opinionof the Institute of Medicine (IOM), which says it’s possible to put a mechanismtogether by which Hepatitis B could cause an immune mediated injury.”Notwithstanding this statement by the IOM, Dr. Leist found in this case there isnot “a reputable theory by which one could explain a small fiber neuropathy, atheory that is accepted . . . it’s not accepted with respect to the Hepatitis Bvaccine.”Reviewing the evidence on balance, the undersigned finds preponderant evidenceof a “medical theory causally connecting the vaccination and the injury.” To besure, such evidence in this case is not scientifically certain—as respondentpoints out—the medical literature does not specifically link the Hepatitis Bvaccination or any vaccination to the injury of small fiber neuropathy. However,petitioner has provided a sound “medical or scientific explanation that pertainsspecifically to the petitioner’s case . . . that is ‘legally probably,’ even ifnot medically or scientifically certain.”The undersigned will next examine the third prong of the Althen test—thetemporal relationship between Mr. Shaw’s vaccination and his injury—as thisevidence is pivotal to the undersigned’s analysis of the second Althen prong.The Temporal Relationship between the Vaccination and the Injury: Petitionermust show more than a proximate temporal relationship between the vaccinationand the injury to satisfy the burden of showing actual causation.The contemporaneous medical records indicate that petitioner’s symptoms begansix days after the receipt of his second Hepatitis B vaccination. Dr. Morgantestified that six days is appropriate for onset of an immune related disorder.Respondent’s expert, Dr. Leist, agreed that the “temporal relationship betweenthe administration of the vaccine and the onset of symptoms was appropriate. Itis within a period of time that would be acceptable . . . for an immune responseto appear at all.” Because symptoms of petitioner’s injury occurred within anappropriate medical time frame for an immune-mediated injury, petitioner hassatisfied the third prong of the Althen standard.The undersigned turns now to address petitioner’s proposed sequence of cause andeffect.The Sequence of Cause and Effect: The Federal Circuit has observed that anoffered medical theory is persuasive when accompanied by proof of a logicalsequence of cause and effect showing that the vaccination was the reason for theinjury, the logical sequence being supported by reputable medical or scientificexplanation, i.e., evidence in the form of scientific studies or expert medicaltestimony. The Federal Circuit has found the opinions of treating physicians tobe particularly probative in evaluating the second prong of Althen, particularly“if a claimant satisfies the first and third prongs of the Althen standard” as“treating physicians are likely to be in the best position to determine whethera logical sequence of cause and effect shows that the vaccination was the reasonfor the injury.”As discussed above, Mr. Shaw has satisfied the first and third prongs of theAlthen standard. In considering whether Mr. Shaw has demonstrated a logicalsequence of cause and effect, the undersigned turns to the opinions of histreating physicians. As an initial matter, the undersigned notes that it isundisputed that the “leading cause” of small fiber neuropathy is idiopathic—itcannot be identified. However, progress is being made toward identifyingpotential causes of small fiber neuropathy, to include the possibility ofinfections or autoimmune causes.Petitioner has been evaluated and/or treated by a substantial number ofphysicians since his symptoms began in 1999. A remarkable number, although notall, of these treating doctors have either postulated or ascribed vaccinecausation to his injury. Particularly persuasive to the undersigned was theopinion of vaccine-related causation expressed by petitioner’s treatingneurologists. Dr. Lin, an examining neurologist, recorded that petitioner wassuffering a post-inflammatory neuropathy related to immunizations. It was Dr.Lomen-Hoerth’s, Mr. Shaw’s primary neurologist, early impression that petitionerhad a progressive small fiber neuropathy rather than a static neuropathy relatedto his vaccinations. A consulting neurologist, Dr. Dresser recorded hisimpression in 2002 that petitioner suffers from diffuse dysesthetic painfollowing remote vaccinations. Dr. Martin, a rheumatologist, indicated thatpetitioner suffered from an idiopathic syndrome associated with chronic fatigueand . . . is possibly related to a vaccine exposure or possibly a toxin. Dr.Chiu, an internist, observed that because petitioner’s neurologic changes seemto have arisen after his immunization in 1999, there is a question as to whetherthere is some type of autoimmune or other reaction to this vaccination.” Dr.Berkenblit, an internist, maintained that while there is no clear link betweenHepatitis B vaccination and progressive neuropathic pain, if Mr. Shaw diddevelop symptoms of a sensory neuropathy as a consequence of the vaccine, itwould most likely be an autoimmune type mechanism. Dr. Roberts, petitioner’sprimary care physician, wrote a letter in 2002 indicating his belief that thetemporal relationship between the received vaccination and the onset ofpetitioner’s symptoms strongly correlated with the hypothesis that the symptomswere caused by the vaccination. Dr. Allen, who evaluated petitioner inconnection with his worker’s compensation claim, believed that petitioner’sinjury “may have developed as a result of the June 1999 vaccinations.” Dr.Buttram, an internist, maintained the opinion that Mr. Shaw’s “peripheralneuropathy is directly related to (was caused by) a series of two Hepatitis Bvaccines. “Vaccine-induced neuroimmune dysfunction” was the diagnosis of Dr.Natali, a general practitioner. Dr. Cullen, an anesthesiologist, describedpetitioner in 2006 as “a 46-year-old man who suffered an intense adversereaction to a Hepatitis B vaccine in 1999, developing a small fiber neuropathy.”Dr. Palmer, another anesthesiologist, assessed petitioner as “a 46-year-oldgentleman with six years of diffuse pain after vaccination, consistent with adiffuse small-fiber neuropathy. . . .” Dr. Sullivan found in February 2007 thatpetitioner’s “chronic polyneuropathy persists, secondary to a Hepatitis Badverse reaction.” In a report following a neuropsychological evaluationconducted at the request of petitioner’s disability attorney, Dr. Scoppconcluded that petitioner suffered from a “progressive peripheral neuropathysubsequent to Hepatitis B inoculation.” Requesting reinstatement of petitioner’sdisability benefits, Dr. Julian, a primary care physician, wrote, “Specialistsbelieve the cause of petitioner’s neuropathy is likely due to a vaccine hereceived in the late 1990’s.”Respondent points out that some of petitioner’s treaters subsequently modifiedtheir early opinions of vaccine causation or failed to ascribe his injury tovaccine-related causation. For example, Dr. Chiu noted the temporal relationshipto the vaccine, but did not opine as to causation. Dr. Villanueva doubtedvaccine causation, and Dr. Lin later altered her initial diagnosis ofvaccine-related post inflammatory neuropathy. The undersigned takes note ofthese observations; but the record indicates that a number of the petitioner’streating physicians postulated that petitioner’s condition was vaccine-mediated,informed—in part—by the temporal relationship between Mr. Shaw’s vaccinationsand the onset of his injury.Respondent further argues that Dr. Morgan’s theory of a post-vaccine immuneresponse causing a demyelinating injury must fail because the evidence does notsupport a finding that Mr. Shaw experienced an immune response to hisvaccination. Respondent bases this assertion on the finding that petitioner’sSeptember 26, 2001 antibody testing was negative for IgG antibodies, the classof antibodies that assist in fighting against infection. Dr. Leist testifiedthat while IgM antibodies initially mount a response to vaccination (or anyother presented antigen), these antibodies are normally converted to IgGantibodies starting at day seven or eight. It was Dr. Allen’s view thatpetitioner was suffering from fibromyalgia.However, on cross-examination, Dr. Leist conceded that IgM antibodies may “playa role” in demyelinating disorders that petitioner may have had a significantIgM response that never converted to an IgG response, and that petitioner wasnever tested for IgM antibodies. However, Dr. Leist maintained that while thesewere “theoretical” possibilities, he found them to be “exceedingly improbable.”On balance, the undersigned is persuaded that petitioner has demonstrated alogical sequence of cause and effect. Petitioner has presented sound scientifictestimony from a medical expert, well qualified in the field of neurology, thatoffers a cogent explanation of how petitioner’s Hepatitis B vaccination morelikely than not caused him to develop a small fiber neuropathy by way ofmolecular mimicry. Petitioner has presented uncontested evidence of a proximatetemporal relationship between the vaccination and the injury. And, finally, anumber of petitioner’s treating physicians attributed Mr. Shaw’s injury to theHepatitis B vaccines he received.CONCLUSIONAs discussed above, the undersigned finds that petitioner has established bypreponderant evidence in this close case that his Hepatitis B vaccination wasthe legal cause of his small fiber neuropathy. The undersigned further findsthat there is not a preponderance of the evidence that the legal cause of Mr.Shaw’s injury was due to factors unrelated to his Hepatitis B vaccination.Accordingly, the undersigned finds Mr. Shaw is entitled to compensation underthe Vaccine Act. A separate damages order will issue.IT IS SO ORDERED.Anita Roberts and Gary Roberts, Co-petitioners, as Next Friends, Parents actingon behalf of Amber D. Roberts their minor child, Petitioners v. Secretary ofHealth and Human Services, RespondentSummary: In this decision following a hearing, Special Master Zane rules thatthe victim suffered transverse myelitis after receiving atetanus-diptheria-acellular pertussis vaccine.Compensated Vaccine Injury: Transverse MyelitisAccording to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke,transverse myelitis is a neurological disorder caused by inflammation acrossboth sides of one level, or segment, of the spinal cord. The term myelitisrefers to inflammation of the spinal cord; transverse simply describes theposition of the inflammation, that is, across the width of the spinal cord.Attacks of inflammation can damage or destroy myelin, the fatty insulatingsubstance that covers nerve cell fibers. This damage causes nervous system scarsthat interrupt communications between the nerves in the spinal cord and the restof the body.Symptoms of transverse myelitis include a loss of spinal cord function overseveral hours to several weeks. What usually begins as a sudden onset of lowerback pain, muscle weakness, or abnormal sensations in the toes and feet canrapidly progress to more severe symptoms, including paralysis, urinaryretention, and loss of bowel control. Although some patients recover fromtransverse myelitis with minor or no residual problems, others suffer permanentimpairments that affect their ability to perform ordinary tasks of daily living.Most patients will have only one episode of transverse myelitis; a smallpercentage may have a recurrence.The segment of the spinal cord at which the damage occurs determines which partsof the body are affected. Nerves in the cervical (neck) region control signalsto the neck, arms, hands, and muscles of breathing (the diaphragm). Nerves inthe thoracic (upper back) region relay signals to the torso and some parts ofthe arms. Nerves at the lumbar (mid-back) level control signals to the hips andlegs. Finally, sacral nerves, located within the lowest segment of the spinalcord, relay signals to the groin, toes, and some parts of the legs. Damage atone segment will affect function at that segment and segments below it. Inpatients with transverse myelitis, demyelination usually occurs at the thoraciclevel, causing problems with leg movement and bowel and bladder control, whichrequire signals from the lower segments of the spinal cord.Transverse myelitis occurs in adults and children, in both genders, and in allraces. No familial predisposition is apparent. A peak in incidence rates (thenumber of new cases per year) appears to occur between 10 and 19 years and 30and 39 years. Although only a few studies have examined incidence rates, it isestimated that about 1,400 new cases of transverse myelitis are diagnosed eachyear in the United States, and approximately 33,000 Americans have some type ofdisability resulting from the disorder.Researchers are uncertain of the exact causes of transverse myelitis. Theinflammation that causes such extensive damage to nerve fibers of the spinalcord may result from viral infections or abnormal immune reactions. Transversemyelitis also may occur as a complication of syphilis, measles, Lyme disease,and some vaccinations, including those for chickenpox and rabies. Cases in whicha cause cannot be identified are called idiopathic.Transverse myelitis often develops following viral infections. Infectious agentssuspected of causing transverse myelitis include varicella zoster (the virusthat causes chickenpox and shingles), herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus,Epstein-Barr, influenza, echovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),hepatitis A, and rubella. Bacterial skin infections, middle-ear infections(otitis media), and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (bacterial pneumonia) have also beenassociated with the condition.In post-infectious cases of transverse myelitis, immune system mechanisms,rather than active viral or bacterial infections, appear to play an importantrole in causing damage to spinal nerves. Although researchers have not yetidentified the precise mechanisms of spinal cord injury in these cases,stimulation of the immune system in response to infection indicates that anautoimmune reaction may be responsible. In autoimmune diseases, the immunesystem, which normally protects the body from foreign organisms, mistakenlyattacks the body’s own tissue, causing inflammation and, in some cases, damageto myelin within the spinal cord.Because some affected individuals also have autoimmune diseases such as systemiclupus erythematosus, Sjogren’s syndrome, and sarcoidosis, some scientistssuggest that transverse myelitis may also be an autoimmune disorder. Inaddition, some cancers may trigger an abnormal immune response that may lead totransverse myelitis.In some people, transverse myeltis represents the first symptom of an underlyingdemyelinating disease of the central nervous system such as multiple sclerosis(MS) or neuromyelitis optica (NMO). A form of transverse myelitis known as“partial” myelitis—because it affects only a portion of the cross-sectional areaof the spinal cord—is more characteristic of MS. Neuromyelitis optica typicallycauses both transverse myelitis and optic neuritis (inflammation of the opticnerve that results in visual loss), but not necessarily at the same time. Allpatients with transverse myelitis should be evaluated for MS or NMO becausepatients with these diagnoses may require different treatments, especiallytherapies to prevent future attacks.Transverse myelitis may be either acute (developing over hours to several days)or subacute (usually developing over 1 to 4 weeks). Initial symptoms usuallyinclude localized lower back pain, sudden paresthesias (abnormal sensations suchas burning, tickling, pricking, or tingling) in the legs, sensory loss, andparaparesis (partial paralysis of the legs). Paraparesis may progress toparaplegia (paralysis of the legs and lower part of the trunk). Urinary bladderand bowel dysfunction is common. Many patients also report experiencing musclespasms, a general feeling of discomfort, headache, fever, and loss of appetite.Depending on which segment of the spinal cord is involved, some patients mayexperience respiratory problems as well.From this wide array of symptoms, four classic features of transverse myelitisemerge: (1) weakness of the legs and arms, (2) pain, (3) sensory alteration, and(4) bowel and bladder dysfunction. Most patients will experience weakness ofvarying degrees in their legs; some also experience it in their arms. Initially,people with transverse myelitis may notice that they are stumbling or draggingone foot or that their legs seem heavier than normal. Coordination of hand andarm movements, as well as arm and hand strength may also be compromised.Progression of the disease leads to full paralysis of the legs, requiring thepatient to use a wheelchair.Pain is the primary presenting symptom of transverse myelitis in approximatelyone-third to one-half of all patients. The pain may be localized in the lowerback or may consist of sharp, shooting sensations that radiate down the legs orarms or around the torso.Patients who experience sensory disturbances often use terms such as numbness,tingling, coldness, or burning to describe their symptoms. Up to 80 percent ofthose with transverse myelitis report areas of heightened sensitivity to touch,such that clothing or a light touch with a finger causes significant discomfortor pain (a condition called allodynia). Many also experience heightenedsensitivity to changes in temperature or to extreme heat or cold.Bladder and bowel problems may involve increased frequency of the urge tourinate or have bowel movements, incontinence, difficulty voiding, the sensationof incomplete evacuation, and constipation. Over the course of the disease, themajority of people with transverse myelitis will experience one or several ofthese symptoms.Entitlement; tetanus-diptheria-accellular pertussis vaccination (“Tdap”);transverse myelitis (“TM”); oligoclonal banding; infarction; fibrocartilaginousembolism (“FCE”)Case No: 09-427VDate Filed: August 29, 2013Anita Roberts and Gary Roberts, Co-petitioners, as Next Friends, Parents actingon behalf of Amber D. Roberts their minor child, Petitioners v. Secretary ofHealth and Human Services, RespondentRULINGSpecial Master ZanePetitioners, Anita Roberts and Gary Roberts (“Petitioners”), on behalf of theirdaughter, Amber Roberts (“A.R.”), filed a petition alleging that thetetanus-diptheria-acellular pertussisvaccine (“Tdap”) caused A.R. to suffertransverse myelitis. Petitioners seek compensation pursuant to the NationalChildhood Vaccine Injury Act. As explained below, upon consideration of therecord as a whole, the special master concludes that Petitioners have satisfiedtheir burden of showing by preponderant evidence that the vaccine was asubstantial factor in causing A.R.’s autoimmune problem, transverse myelitis(“TM”). As explained below, there is ample evidence to satisfy Althen’s Prong 1.Petitioners rely on the well-recognized theory of molecular mimicry as theplausible medical theory that explains how the vaccine could have caused A.R.’sinjuries. And, there is no dispute regarding Althen’s Prong 3. The parties’experts agree that the time between vaccination and onset, approximately fourweeks, is a medically appropriate temporal relationship.The parties’ primary disagreement relates to Althen Prong 2 and whetherPetitioners made a sufficient showing that there was a logical sequence of causeand effect between the vaccine and A.R.’s injuries. With regard to this issue,both parties have presented detailed evidence regarding the proper diagnosis ofA.R.’s injury, the permanent paralysis of her lower extremities, and whether itwas due to an inflammation caused by an autoimmune response, TM, or was theresult of an infarction, embolism or FCE. As set forth below, the record, inparticular, the clinical evidence and the results of the objective diagnostictests with supporting medical literature in the record, sufficiently supportsPetitioners’ claim as to Althen’s Prong 2. As such, Petitioners have satisfiedall three Althen Prongs and have satisfied their burden.FACTSA.R. was born on July 2, 1995. P’s Ex. 1. During the first 11 years of her lifeA.R. was generally healthy. On July 06, 2006, A.R. visited her pediatrician fora sixth grade check-up. Although she complained of back pain at that time, therecords noted she was generally healthy. She received a Tdap vaccine. Afterreceiving the vaccine, A.R. noticed a knot under the skin where she received theshot and her skin was slightly swollen. About a week after receiving thevaccine, A.R. felt her feet tingled a bit while she was riding in her father’struck. The tingling was not like the sensation of her legs falling asleep, whichshe had experienced before. Petitioner reported sitting in the back of herfather’s truck with her legs crossed for 30 to 45 minutes prior to feeling thetingling in her legs. Petitioner also reported never experiencing this type oftingling before.On August 4, 2006, A.R. went to the county fair with her mother, brother, andsome of her brother’s friends. While at the fair, A.R. rode some rides, deniedhaving any back or hip pain. Her mother said A.R. did not tell her about anypains. The next morning A.R.’s mother recalled A.R. complaining of a slight backache. At some point on August 5, 2006, A.R. went to the bathroom. On the way tothe bathroom, her feet felt a little heavy although she was still able to walkto the bathroom. In addition, she had some slight incontinence. A.R. sat down onthe toilet and her legs got heavy and she could not get back up. She fell to thebathroom floor. She still had some feeling in her legs but then it started to goaway and eventually she felt nothing. Her mother and brother helped her up, andthey went to the hospital.At the hospital, the initial impression was an acute onset of being unable tofeel or move her legs. The notes from A.R’s neurologic exam recorded A.R. ashaving “abnormal proprioception of the right and left lower extremities.” Thesymptoms were consistent with a central lesion leading to a sensory defectaffecting both sides of the body. An x-ray of the thoracic spine was taken,which showed no evidence of an acute fracture. The primary diagnosis was acuteparaplegia. A.R. was transferred by ambulance to the Cincinnati Children’sHospital. The impression recorded at the time A.R. presented at the emergencydepartment of Cincinnati Children’s Hospital was acute onset lower extremityparalysis, afebrile, and without any previous illness. Magnetic ResonanceImaging (“MRI”) of A.R.’s cervical spine and a lumbar puncture were performed.Cerebral spinal fluid (“CSF”) results indicated a protein of 60 and red bloodcell count of 8. It was noted that although the CSF study was considered normal,it was to be repeated because it was still very early after presentation. Theinitial MRI report noted “mild central cord high T2 signal from T10 to theconus.” The impression was that this might represent myelitis, viral infection,or less likely cord ischemia or Guillain-Barré. Additionally, disc desiccationwas observed at L2/L3, L3/L4, L4/L5, and L5/S1 and there was no evidence of cordcompression. A subsequent addendum note in the report observed an abnormal T2signal within the cord appeared to extend to the T7 level, although axialT2-weighted images demonstrated motion artifact. A.R. was admitted to thehospital in stable condition with an ER diagnosis of paraplegia.The hospital admission records reflect in the medical history that A.R.complained of bilateral hip pain the night of the fair. A.R. disputed this,testifying that the source of this statement was her father who had not been athome with her to have any knowledge of that.On August 6, 2006, the attending physician noted the MRI findings with the T2signal on at least the T10-T12 segments. P’s Ex. 11 a 146. He also notedbilateral flaccid paralysis of the lower extremities. His impression was thatA.R. had transverse myelitis. On August 10, 2006, repeat CSF studies wereperformed. The repeat studies showed a white blood cell count of six [referencerange: 0-4] and CSF protein at 58 mg/dL [reference range: 12-60 mg/dL]. Testingof the CSF obtained during the lumbar puncture on August 10, 2006, revealedoligoclonal bands, with the bands also present in A.R.’s serum sample, which hadnot been present previously. Additionally, the IgG levels had increased from thelevels of August 6, 2006.A.R.’s condition did not improve, and she subsequently began intravenous gammaglobulin treatment on August 11, 2006, followed by a prednisone taper treatmentstarted on August 12, 2006. A.R.’s condition, however, still did not change. OnAugust 14, 2006, it was noted that A.R. had “slightly improved sensation” andshe was transferred to the inpatient rehabilitation floor with a formaldiagnosis of transverse myelitis. Over the next month, A.R. receivedoccupational, recreational, and physical therapy. A.R.’s condition, however, didnot improve further, and she was discharged on September 15, 2006.After the discharge, A.R. was seen by pediatric neurologist, Lois Krousgrill,for a follow up on September 27, 2006. Dr. Krousgrill noted that A.R. had norecovery from motor or sensory function. Dr. Krousgrill’s impression wasidiopathic TM.A second MRI was performed on November 1, 2006 which showed a subtlehyperintense T2 signal “centrally within the cord at the T6-T7 level.” Thereport continued: “Hyperintense T2 signal to a greater degree is noted with thecord from the T8-T9 level to the L1 level.” The radiologist noted that thesignal at the T8-T9 level “likely represents myelomalacia.” “Significantatrophy” from T8-T9 to the tip of the conus was also observed. In addition, theimage was remarkable for mild disc desiccation from L2-3 to L5-S1 level, as wellas subtle disc bulges at L2-L3, L3-L4, and L4-L5.A.R. was readmitted to Cincinnati Children’s hospital for initial plasmapheresistreatments on October 30, 2006 and November 2, 2006. She received furtherplasmapheresis treatments three times per week over the next two weeks.Unfortunately, Amber did not improve upon the treatment and no marked recoverywas observed. Despite treatment and therapy, A.R. continued to have a neurogenicbladder/bowel, period decubitis ulcers, multiple UTIs, incontinence, vaginalcandidiasis, joint contractures, and constipation since the onset of the acuteparalysis symptom. At the time of hearing, A.R. was in 11th grade, was still ina wheelchair and could not stand or walk. There were ten treatments originallyscheduled, but the ninth and tenth were abandoned when A.R. had no recoveryafter the first eight treatments.PROCEDURAL HISTORYOn July 1, 2009, Petitioners, Gary Roberts and Anita Roberts filed a petitionfor compensation under the National Vaccine Injury Act if 1986 on behalf of herdaughter, A.R. Petitioners alleged that A.R. suffered from TM as a result of herreceipt of a Tdap vaccine on July 06, 2006. Subsequently, the parties filedexpert reports. On October 14, 2010, pursuant to order of the previouslyassigned Special Master, supplemental expert reports were filed.On March 26 and 27, 2012, an entitlement hearing was held in Cincinnati, OH. Oneof the petitioners, Anita Roberts, and A.R. testified. Three expert witnessestestified on behalf of Petitioners. First, Dr. Lois Krousgrill, a neurologist,who had examined A.R. at and near the time of the onset of A.R.’s injuries,testified. She opined that A.R. had TM, not an embolism or infarction orfibrocartilaginous embolism (“FCE”) based on her clinical picture and theresults of diagnostic tests. She further testified that she believed there was arelationship between the vaccine and A.R.’s TM. Second, Dr. Sidney Houff, aneurologist, testified. Dr. Houff opined that A.R. had suffered from anautoimmune reaction to the vaccine she received which caused her to havetransverse myelitis. Third and finally, Dr. Mary Edwards-Brown, aneuroradiologist, testified that this was an unusual case of TM. She furtherconcluded that the TM was due to the vaccine.Two experts testified on behalf of Respondent. First, Dr. John Sladky, aneurologist, testified. He opined that he believed that A.R.’s clinical featureswere more indicative of a spinal cord infarction, an embolism or FCE than TM, aninflammatory condition. He further opined that even if A.R. had TM, he did notthink there was enough evidence to conclude the vaccine caused it. Second, Dr.Louis Vezina, a neuroradiologist, testified. Dr. Vezina opined that based on theimaging studies, the findings were consistent with those of a lower spinal cordinfarction; embolism and FCE are described in various places in the record andthe terms are used interchangeably. In essence, they refer to an event thatabruptly stops the blood flow to the spinal cord, i.e., a stroke in the spinalcord. Infarction is a blood clot in the spine; an embolism was described as ablockage that caused a cut off of blood flow down the spine. Transverse myelitis(TM) is an acute “inflammatory” disorder of the spinal cord resulting inbilateral motor, sensory, and sphincter deficits below the level of the lesion.APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARDSThe Vaccine Act provides two means of recovery: Table claims and off-Tableclaims. In an off-Table, or causation-in-fact, case, such as this one, apetitioner must prove actual causation by a preponderance of the evidence. Toprove actual causation, a petitioner must “show that the vaccine was not only abut-for cause of the injury but also a substantial factor in bringing about theinjury.” Causation is determined on a case-by-case basis. A petitioner satisfiesthis burden if he or she provides: (1) a medical theory causally connecting thevaccination and the injury; (2) a logical sequence of cause and effect showingthat the vaccination was the reason for the injury; and (3) a showing ofproximate temporal relationship between vaccination and injury. A petitionermust satisfy the three Althen prongs by preponderant evidence. Thispreponderant-evidence standard “simply requires the trier of fact to believethat the existence of a fact is more probable than its nonexistence” (noting thestandard requires that a petitioner demonstrate the existence of the element is“more probable than not”). Evidence used to satisfy one of the Althen prongs canoverlap and be used to satisfy another prong. There are no “hard and fast per sescientific or medical rules” for finding causation under the Vaccine Act. TheVaccine Act does provide that a claimant may satisfy the preponderant evidencestandard by producing “medical records or a medical opinion.” A petitioner mustprovide a reputable medical or scientific explanation that pertains specificallyto the petitioner’s case. However, the explanation need only be “legallyprobable, not medically or scientifically certain.” Along these lines, a specialmaster may not require “epidemiologic studies . . . or general acceptance in thescientific or medical communities. . . .” At the same time, special masters are“entitled to require some indicia of reliability to support the assertion of theexpert witness.” In determining reliability, in a Table case, unlike the presentcase, a claimant who shows that he or she received a vaccination listed in theVaccine Injury Table, 42 U.S.C. § 300aa–14, and suffered an injury listed in theTable within a prescribed period is afforded a presumption of causation.When a party relies upon expert testimony, that testimony must have a reliablescientific basis. Although a party need not produce medical literature toestablish causation, where such evidence is submitted, the special master canconsider it in reaching an informed judgment as to whether a particularvaccination likely caused a particular injury. Causation can be supported by atreating physician’s opinion that a vaccination was causally linked to thevaccinee’s injury if the special master finds the opinion to be both reliableand persuasive. At the same time, in cases in which a petitioner relies uponexpert testimony to prove causation, the expert testimony must rest upon anobjective and reliable scientific basis and must prove causation to a degree oflegal certainty, but not to a medical or scientific certainty.” A petitionermust provide a reputable medical or scientific explanation that pertainsspecifically to the petitioner’s case, although the explanation need only belegally probable, not medically or scientifically certain.” Although apetitioner may rely solely on expert testimony, “an expert opinion is no betterthan the soundness of the reasons supporting it.” Therefore, a special masterdoes not need to credit “expert opinion testimony that is connected to theexisting data or methodology ‘only by the ipse dixit of the expert,’ or where‘there is simply too great an analytical gap between the data and the opinionproffered.’ With regard to alternative causes, the respondent bears the burdenof proving by preponderant evidence that an alternative cause, or factorunrelated, was the sole cause of the injury. But, neither 42 U.S.C. § 300aa-13nor the decisions limit what evidence the special master may consider indeciding whether a prima facie case has been established. As a result, thegovernment may also present and the special master may consider evidence ofalternative causes on the issue of the adequacy of the petitioner’s evidenceregarding the petitioner’s case-in-chief. In this regard, there are twoparticular points that the decisions make clear. First, a special master may notrequire the petitioner to shoulder the burden of eliminating all possiblealternative causes in order to establish a prima facie case. Second, a specialmaster may find that a factor other than a vaccine caused the injury in questiononly if that finding is supported by a preponderance of the evidence. Thepetitioner does not bear the burden of eliminating alternative independentpotential causes, and the respondent has the burden of proving an alternativecause as the sole, unrelated factor that caused the injury by a preponderance ofevidence. It is established that a special master is entitled to, and should,consider the record as a whole in determining causation. In considering therecord, the Vaccine Act does not contemplate full blown tort litigation. Apetitioner may use circumstantial evidence to prove the case, and “close calls”regarding causation must be resolved in favor of the petitioner. Indeed, “thepurpose of the Vaccine Act’s preponderance standard is to allow the finding ofcausation in a field bereft of complete and direct proof of how vaccines affectthe human body.”DISCUSSIONHaving considered the record as a whole and discussed below, the special masterconcludes that Petitioners have satisfied their burden of establishing bypreponderant evidence that they are entitled to compensation.Petitioners Have Presented a Plausible Medical Theory, Molecular Mimicry, AlongWith Supporting Literature That the Vaccine Can Cause A.R.’s Injuries, TherebySatisfying Althen ProngPetitioners have satisfied Althen’s Prong 1 by presenting a plausible medicaltheory. In support of Prong 1, Petitioners’ expert, Dr. Houff, described theprocess of molecular mimicry as a mechanism whereby the vaccine could cause anautoimmune response that could result in TM, what he had concluded A.R.experienced. This was also discussed in the article submitted, TransverseMyelitis and Vaccines: A Multi-analysis. Petitioners also submitted a number ofother articles from various medical journals. The medical literature submittedprovided further support that it has been recognized that Tdap could cause TM.Those articles are evidence supportive of Petitioners’ theory.Respondent’s expert, Dr. Sladky, did not deny that vaccines might causeautoimmune responses such as TM. In commenting on Petitioners’ theory, withoutproviding any particular reasoning, Dr. Sladky merely said, in a conclusoryfashion, that he was not sure there was sufficient evidence on which to basePetitioners’ conclusion regarding a theory.Respondent’s expert did admit that Petitioners had certainly submittedliterature in support of their theory. Dr. Sladky expressed that the articleswere not that persuasive because they showed the rarity of TM post-vaccine.Nonetheless, Dr. Sladky admitted that there were case reports that supported thetheory of TM as a complication of vaccinations, including Tdap. For purposes ofthe Vaccine Program, Petitioners are not required to establish that there isepidemiological evidence to support their theory.Rather, the Vaccine Program acknowledges the rarity of vaccine-caused injuries,and, nonetheless, recognizes that compensation for such injuries is appropriate.The purpose of the Vaccine Act’s preponderance standard is to allow the findingof causation in a field bereft of complete and direct proof of how vaccinesaffect the human body, explaining that “to require identification and proof ofspecific biological mechanisms would be inconsistent with the purpose and natureof the vaccine compensation program.”Considering the evidence with these standards in mind, Petitioners havepresented sufficient evidence to demonstrate a plausible medical theory by whichthe vaccine could have caused the condition with which Petitioners claim A.R.suffers, TM. Petitioners have satisfied Althen’s Prong 1.Petitioners Have Presented Preponderant Evidence That There Is a LogicalSequence of Cause and Effect Between the Vaccine and A.R.’s Injuries By ShowingThat A.R.’s Injuries Were Caused by an Autoimmune Response and Not an Embolismand That the Vaccine Was a Substantial Factor in Causing the InjuryPetitioners claimed that A.R. suffered from transverse myelitis, an inflammatorydemylinating condition in the central nervous system that was caused by anautoimmune response. Respondent, on the other hand, while not claiming topresent an alternative cause or factor unrelated as a defense, nonetheless,argued that there was evidence that A.R.’s injury was more likely caused by anembolism obstructing blood from flowing down the spine. As such, according toRespondent, Petitioners had not satisfied their burden as to Prong 2.The record demonstrates that there was evidence that A.R.’s clinical picturealong with the diagnostic tests support that A.R.’s injuries were caused by aninflammation of the central nervous system that was caused by an autoimmuneresponse. The record also demonstrates that there is preponderant evidence thatthe vaccine caused that injury.Petitioners Have Shown by Preponderant Evidence That A.R. Experienced anAutoimmune Response Petitioners have presented sufficient evidence that A.R.’ssymptoms were caused by an autoimmune response. First, Dr. Krousgrill, one ofA.R.’s treating physicians, concluded that A.R. had TM, a condition caused by anautoimmune response. In reaching her conclusion, Dr. Krousgrill relied on herexamination of A.R., her review of medical records and her medical knowledge.One factor that Dr. Krousgrill considered was the progression of A.R.’ssymptoms. Dr. Krousgrill noted that A.R.’s symptoms began with A.R. experiencingtingling in her legs shortly after receipt of the vaccination. The tingling inher legs was different than that she had experienced in the past. And, A.R. hadalso explained that for several hours before she went to the bathroom on August5, 2006, A.R. had experienced tingling. This indicated that the onset was notthe abrupt onset that occurred over a matter of minutes, a conclusion upon whichRespondent’s experts had relied in formulating their opinions. Instead, it wasconsistent with an autoimmune response, TM. Dr. Krousgrill also looked at thetemporal relation and the MRI findings that indicated a focal inflammatoryprocess in the central portion of the cord that involved the entire cord. Inaddition, although the CSF proteins were steadily high between the first andsecond lumbar punctures, the fact is that A.R. did not have many white bloodcounts. Finally, the appearance of oligoclonal bands in the central nervoussystem indicated an active infection or inflammation. The location of the lesionand broad extent of it shown on the MRI findings indicated that it was morelikely this was a transverse process.Dr. Houff testified that he concluded that A.R. suffered an autoimmune response.He based his conclusion on A.R.’s picture as a whole, i.e., the clinicalpicture, the exam, the radiology, her spinal fluid and all the studies. Inparticular, the signal on the MRI findings from that indicated a widespreadeffect, from T-2 through T-7, the evidence of oligoclonal banding after thesecond tap, the elevated complement, her high level of C-1 inhibitor, and theemergency room finding some sensation above the knee but no sensation below theknees and a mild sensation above the knees to T-12 and her poor rectal tone andincontinence all indicated that A.R. experienced a progressive, autoimmuneresponse. Additionally, Dr. Houff explained that A.R. met four of the criteriafor TM as established by the Transverse Myelitis Working Group. The four“inflammation” criteria that were present included abnormal godlinlimenhancement of the spinal cord, “a CSF pleocytosis,” and “elevated CSF IgGindex.” Id. at 4. Those inflammatory markers within the spinal cord are criticalfactors to distinguish TM, a type of inflammatory myelopathy, from othernoninflammatory myelopathy, like “ischemia, radiation, epidural lipomatosis orfibrocartilagenous embolism.”Petitioners’ evidence shows that the presence of the majority of the criteria aswell as the results of the independent evaluations support Petitioner’s request.There is ample evidence to support Petitioners.Respondent’s Argument That the Cause of A.R.’s Injuries Is Likely an Embolism,Infarction or FCE Versus TM Is Unreliable and Unsupported by the Facts.Respondent’s claims that there is evidence that A.R.’s injuries are more likelycaused by an embolism are unsupported by the objective clinical and diagnosticevidence, and her expert’s conclusions are unreliable. Whereas both ofPetitioners’ expert neurologists, Dr. Krousgill and Dr. Houff, presentedlogically reliable testimony, Respondent’s expert’s, Dr. Sladky’s, testimony didnot present the same level of reliability.First, Dr. Sladky admitted that the theory that this is an infarction cannotnecessarily be shown. For instance, he admitted there was no evidence as to howan infarct might have happened because there is no evidence of any trauma. Inpart his conclusion is simply based on the fact that he “doesn’t think that TMwould behave in the fashion it did. And, he admitted that there was no evidenceof severe back pain, something indicative of FCE. And, the objective evidenceindicated that A.R.’s conditions are unlikely due to an embolism. As Dr. Brownexplained, based on the view of the MRI, this was not an infarction becausethere is not a focal lesion that one would expect to see in an infarction.Rather, the lesion is quite widespread, consistent with an autoimmune response.And, the injury about which Respondent theorizes is also inconsistent with theanatomy of the blood supply to the spinal cord. For this theory to actuallyoccur this disk material would have had to enter one of the lumbar arterials andsomehow communicated with a vessel coming off the aorta, but that’s not the waythe arterial anatomy works. One has a small artery at each lumbar vertebrallevel supplying a small amount of the blood supply to the cauda equine, andthere’s not even a spinal cord at that level, but just nerve roots. One cansomehow have an embolism in one artery and have it somehow get to another partof the spinal cord. That’s not the way the arterial anatomy is constructed.Dr. Krousgrill testified that it was significant that the entire cord wasaffected and that indicated this was TM versus an embolism. The two primaryavenues for circulation to the cord are the anterior spinal artery. It would beunusual to have an ischemia in all 3 vessels simultaneously all at the samelevel. Unlike A.R.’s situation, when a spinal artery is involved it is typicallyan anterior or lateral cord syndrome with mild or mixed sensory results. Theclinical progression is not consistent with an infarction or embolism.Additionally, Dr. Brown also reiterated that which Petitioners’ other experts,Dr. Krousgrill and Dr. Houff, had already stated in connection with theirconclusions of the lumbar punctures or spinal taps performed on August 6 ascompared to those performed on August 10. It was significant that in the firsttap there was not evidence of oligoclonal banding, whereas in the section onethere was, because an inflammatory response in the spinal cord does not lookfull blown immediately. It takes some time.This objective, diagnostic evidence shows that there is a lack of support forRespondent’s claimed cause and support for Petitioners’ claim that A.R.experienced an autoimmune response. Second, Respondent’s expert, Dr. Sladky,acknowledged that there was a basis for a conclusion that A.R. had an autoimmuneresponse. He admitted that some of the accepted criteria for TM were definitelypresent. He also admitted that there is respected literature that includes TM asa complication of vaccinations, including Tdap vaccinations. And he admittedthat oligoclonal bands are indicative of an immune response. In fact, Dr.Sladky’s explanation for the oligoclonal bands being in the serum and spinalfluid is not logical in light of the facts. He testified that the presence ofoligoclonal banding in serum and the spinal fluid even if it was infarctioncould be explained because IgG was produced originally in the serum as a resultof immunization and was leaked into the spinal fluid through broken bloodbarrier resulting from infarction. But, Dr. Vezina disagreed that the bandingwould appear just in the course after a vaccine, saying it was clearly anabnormal response. Finally, a last factor in considering the reliability of histestimony that the special master must consider is the information that wasrevealed relative to Dr. Sladky’s status at the time of his work on this caseand testimony. In May 2013, it was revealed that Dr. Sladky’s medical licensehad agreed not to practice medicine from August 2008 to March 2009 and then hadagreed to a suspension of his license that lasted from June 2009 to March 2010.At that time his license was restored on a probationary basis, the probationfinally terminating on July 2011. At the time he submitted his expert reports inthis case, he was on probation. And, in discussing his qualifications at thehearing, no mention was made of these circumstances and such information wasglossed over. In fact, in his testimony, Dr. Sladky said he was the Chief of thePediatric Dept. at Emory University until 2009. But, given that he was notpracticing medicine after August 2008, it is questionable whether that could bethe case. Certainly, this leads the special master to pause when weighing theexperts’ opinions. For all the foregoing reasons, the special master does notfind Dr. Sladky’s testimony as reliable and persuasive as the testimony of Dr.Houff and Dr. Krousgill.Dr. Vezina, Respondent’s neuroradiologist, admitted in his testimony thatalthough he thought TM was less likely, based on the MRI findings, A.R.’sinjuries could be either spinal cord infarction or TM. He also testified thatwith regard to an infarction there would have to be some sort of trauma. Hedeferred to the neurologist on this but admitted that he needed more informationbefore he could state that such trauma had occurred. He also acknowledged thatA.R. had four of the recognized diagnostic criteria for TM, i.e., (1)development of sensory, motor, or autonomic dysfunction attributable to thespinal cord; (2) bilateral signs and/or symptoms; (3) clearly defined sensorylevel (assumes we have this but doesn’t have the medical records); (4)inflammation within the spinal cord demonstrated by CSF, or elevated IgGindexed. Dr. Vezina also testified that he had no direct evidence to prove thatthat Amber suffered an infarct from FCE. Finally, Dr. Vezina admitted that thiswas a close call and “it’s not a clear vascular thing” because it’s a focallesion and on the whole cord. In many ways, Dr. Vezina’s testimony wasconsistent with Dr. Brown’s testimony as well as Petitioners’ other experts. Heacknowledged that there was clearly clinical and diagnostic evidence that A.R.suffered from TM. As he stated this is a close call. In the Vaccine Program,Petitioners are accorded the benefit of close calls.There Is Preponderant Evidence Showing the Vaccine to Be a Substantial Factor inCausing the Autoimmune ResponseThere is also preponderant evidence that the Tdap vaccine was a substantialfactor in causing A.R.’s TM. Dr. Krousgrill, the treating physician, concludedthat having looked at a number of potential etiologies, the vaccine wassignificant. Admittedly, she could not make this a definitive diagnosis basedupon a standard of reasonable degree of medical certainty, but she certainlybelieved there was a relationship between the vaccine and A.R.’s TM. (treatingphysicians’ opinions should be considered). Dr. Houff also explained that inthis case he felt there was enough data to conclude within a reasonable degreeof medical probability that the vaccine caused A.R.’s injuries. In so doing, heexplained that it’s very hard to conclude that vaccines cause injuries. Heacknowledged the importance of vaccines. At the same time, based on hisassessment of the clinical picture in this case, including (1) the progressionof her illness, (2) the temporal association, and (3) the lack of indication ofanother infection, the data was enough to conclude that the vaccine caused A.R.an aberrant immune response that attacked her nervous system, her spinal cord.And, Dr. Brown also discussed how she had concluded that the vaccine causedA.R.’s injuries. She relied on the classic appearance of TM on the imagingstudy, the time frame and A.R.’s history up to that point.Respondent’s expert, Dr. Sladky, did not definitively rule out the vaccine as acause. Instead, in his expert report he simply stated he did not think Dr. Houffprovided a compelling argument to support this position. Weighing the testimonyas presented, the special master finds that Petitioners’ experts were morepersuasive. They explained logically and methodically their reasoning forconcluding the vaccine was a substantial factor. At the same time, they did notoverstate their positions, instead acknowledging that it would be difficult, ifnot impossible, to prove the vaccine was the cause as a matter of medicalcertainty. On the other hand, Respondent’s expert primarily presented aconclusory statement that he did not believe Petitioners had satisfied theirburden. In addition to that, the special master must also look at the cumulativeevidence on all three prongs in that evidence that satisfies Prongs 1 and 3 canoverlap and be used to satisfy Prong 2. Here, there is sufficient evidence tosatisfy Prong 1.There is no question that Prong 3 has been satisfied. The treating physician,Dr. Krousgrill, having considered the clinical picture of A.R. at or near thetime of the onset of symptoms, looked for other potential causes and consideredthem but found none. Tr. at 8-9. Similarly, with regard to temporalrelationship, there is not much question that it is satisfied. That evidencealso overlaps and supports the evidence in the record relating to Prong 2. Insum, Petitioners have presented sufficient proof to demonstrate satisfy theirburden as to Prong 2. In particular, the MRI at the time of the onset of A.R.’scondition indicated a lesion with the entire spinal cord being involved, whichis consistent with inflammation versus embolism. Additionally, the presence ofoligoclonal banding, which was not present initially, and the fact that the CSFprotein levels increased, are indicators that the cause was an immune mediatedprocess, which would eliminate FCE as a potential cause. The fact that A.R.reported having heaviness in her legs for some time and even up to hours beforeher trip to the bathroom when she was unable to move and still had some feelingfor a period afterwards indicates that this was not an abrupt onset asRespondent contends and upon which her expert bases his conclusions. AndPetitioners have also presented preponderant evidence that the Tdap vaccine A.R.received was a substantial factor in causing that autoimmune response.Petitioners’ experts carefully examined the record for other possibleexplanations, [and] researched the medical literature.In weighing the Petitioners’ experts versus Respondent’s experts, the specialmaster concludes that Petitioners’ experts’ opinions are more reliable. Inparticular, A.R.’s treating physician, Dr. Krousgrill, testified for Petitionersthat she had concluded A.R. had TM. Dr. Houff gave a reasoned explanation thatA.R. had TM and that the vaccine caused it. On the other hand, Dr. Sladky,Respondent’s expert, admitted that embolisms were more rare than TM.Respondent’s claims that the evidence of inflammation was unlikely does not seemconsistent with the appearance of oligoclonal bands. Dr. Vezina said that theappearance of banding would not occur merely because someone had a vaccine.Rather, it was clearly an abnormal response.Considering the supporting literature, the strong evidence of the temporalrelation, the evidence of an autoimmune response and lack of any other possibleetiology, there is sufficient evidence to show a logical sequence of cause andeffect. Petitioners have satisfied Althen’s Prong 2.There Is No Dispute as to Althen Prong 3Finally, that there is a medically appropriate temporal relationship is notdisputed. The parties agreed that the time frame between the receipt of thevaccine on July 6, 2006 and the onset of the injuries on August 5, 2006, ismedically appropriate.CONCLUSIONUpon review of the evidence and an assessment of the reliability of the opinionsof the various expert witnesses, the special master concludes that Petitionershave established by preponderant evidence that they are entitled tocompensation. The matter shall now proceed to consideration of damages.IT IS SO ORDERED.Doug Paluck and Rhonda Paluck, as parents and natural guardians on behalf oftheir minor son, Karl Paluck, Petitioners v. Secretary of Health and HumanServices, RespondentSummary: In this case, Judge Lettow rules on appeal after a hearing that aSpecial Master erred in earlier decisions and that the victim’s pre-existingunderlying mitochondrial disease or dysfunction was aggravated by administrationof MMR, varicella, and Prevnar vaccines.Compensated Vaccine Injury: Aggravation of a Pre-existing Mitochondrial DefectLeading to Neurologic InjuryVaccine case; petitioners’ challenge to a special master’s decision on remand;off-Table claim stemming from neurological damage allegedly caused or aggravatedby administration of MMR, varicella, and Prevnar vaccines to a child with agenetic mitochondrial defect; claim asserting an aggravation of a pre-existingcondition; Loving causation framework; entitlement; remandCase No: 07-889VDate Filed: October 29, 2013Doug Paluck and Rhonda Paluck, as parents and natural guardians on behalf oftheir minor son, Karl Paluck, Petitioners v. Secretary of Health and HumanServices, RespondentOPINION AND ORDERCharles F. Lettow, JudgePetitioners, Rhonda and Doug Paluck, on behalf of their son Karl Paluck, seekreview of a decision on remand by a special master dated May 10, 2013, denyingthem compensation under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986.Petitioners filed in accord with the Rules of the Court of Federal Claims. Thisopinion and order will remain sealed for fourteen days, within which time theparties may propose redactions.Their claim on December 21, 2007, alleging that Karl’s receipt of themeasles-mumps-rubella (“MMR”), varicella, and Prevnar vaccines on January 19,2005 caused him either to develop an impairment or to exacerbate a preexistingcondition, resulting in severe neurological damage. The Secretary of Health andHuman Services acknowledges Karl’s injury but contends that its cause isunrelated to the vaccines. Petitioners’ claim is an off-Table injury claim,requiring proof of causation in fact by a preponderance of the evidence. Thespecial master assigned to the case initially denied petitioners’ claim forcompensation on December 14, 2011, finding that the Palucks failed to meet thethree-part causation test established in Althen. In response to a motion bypetitioners for review, this court rendered a decision on April 18, 2012,vacating the special master’s findings under all three Althen prongs andremanding the case to the special master, while “making no affirmative findingsof its own.” In its decision ordering remand, the court directed the specialmaster and the parties first to reassess whether petitioners’ claim was asignificant-aggravation claim that had to be analyzed under the six-part testexplicated in Loving v. Secretary of Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., which thespecial master had not applied. The Loving test combines the three causationfactors from Althen with three additional factors that consider a claimant’shealth before and after the vaccination. The court also directed the specialmaster to reconsider the record as a whole before making new findings regardingcausation in fact.In the remanded proceedings before the special master, no new evidence wassubmitted by either party. Supplemental briefing regarding Karl’s developmentaldelays before and after the vaccine was completed by September 19, 2012. Thestatutory period for decision after the remand expired without a resolution, andon January 30, 2013, petitioners again moved for review by this court because ofthe delay. On May 3, 2013, the court denied the motion, but directed the specialmaster to issue a decision within 120 days. The special master issued a decisiona week thereafter, on May 10, 2013, again denying petitioners’ claim.Petitioners renewed their motion for review of the special master’s decision bythis court, contending that the special master’s findings of fact andconclusions of law are arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, and notin accord with the law. The Palucks ask this court to make its own findings offact and issue a decision on entitlement in their favor.The government argues that the special master’s decision was premised onadequate findings of fact and conclusions of law and should be left undisturbed.The Palucks’ motion for review, filed June 10, 2013, has been fully briefed, anda hearing was held on September 18, 2013.FACTSKarl Paluck currently suffers from an unspecified mitochondrial disorder thatwas most likely present at birth. At the time of the vaccinations, that disorderhad not been detected. After the vaccinations, Karl became severely disabled,but the parties disagree as to the cause.Karl was born on January 15, 2004 and showed no apparent signs of disabilityfrom birth through about the first eight months of life. A concern aboutdevelopmental delay was first recorded on September 27, 2004 by Ms. HeatherErnst during developmental screening at Karl’s daycare provider, as part of theNorth Dakota Right Track Program. She observed delays in his gross and finemotor skills and referred him to an infant development service, K.I.D.S.K.I.D.S. evaluated Karl on October 21, 2004. The evaluation examined areas offine motor skills, gross motor skills, speech and language skills, cognition,and adaptive behavior. Four test protocols were used: Bayley Scales of InfantDevelopment (“Bayley Scales”), PDMS-2 Developmental Motor Scales—gross and finemotor scales (“PDMS-2”), Preschool Language Scale-3 (“PLS-3”), and VinelandAdaptive Behavior Scales (“Vineland”).The Bayley Scales protocol is generally used to test a child’s cognitive skills(i.e., ability to remember, problem solve, use and understand language, andidentify early number concepts). Karl scored “within normal limits” and wasfound to have an 11% delay.Testing with PDMS-2’s gross motor scales evaluated Karl’s ability to use hislarge muscles, and testing with PDMS-2’s fine motor scales evaluated Karl’sability to use his small muscles. Karl showed significant delay in his grossmotor skills: 44% delay in stationary skills (i.e., head and trunk control,sitting), 67% delay in locomotion skills (i.e., rolling/crawling and objectmanipulation), and 67% delay in reflexes (i.e., ability to stay upright.The special master wrongly attributed the referral to K.I.D.S. as having beenprompted by a visit to Karl’s pediatrician, Dr. Stephen McDonough, as a resultof an examination at eight months. In actuality, Karl was not examined at eightmonths of age by Dr. McDonough. Rather, he was examined at four months, sixmonths, and one year by Dr. McDonough. Overall, he ranked in the firstpercentile for gross motor skills. He showed less delay in his fine motorskills: 11% delay in grasping and 22% delay in visual motor integration (i.e.,hand-eye control), ranking in the eighth percentile. Karl could roll over, buthe could not sit without support or crawl. He could not lift his legs off of thefloor while lying on his back. He was, however, using a “wide variety” of finemotor skills. The evaluators could not determine with certainty the reason forhis gross motor delays, but ultimately believed that low muscle tone was theunderlying cause of Karl’s inability to sit and crawl. The evaluators believedthat Karl presented with elevated tone in his legs because he was using them tocompensate for the instability he felt in his arms and trunk. PLS-3 was employedto evaluate Karl’s ability to use and understand language. Karl showed moderatedelays: 33% delay in auditory comprehension and 22% delay in expressivecommunication, ranking in the 32nd percentile. He was able to combine sounds andproduce four different consonant sounds, but he was not imitating others’ soundsor responding to “no, no, Karl.” Lastly, the Vineland protocol tested Karl’sability to care for his needs. It looked to his communication skills, dailyliving skills, socialization, and motor skills. Overall, Karl was evaluated as14% delayed. He was 22% behind in communication skills, 11% behind in dailyliving skills, 0% behind in socialization skills, and 33% behind in motorskills, ranking in the thirtieth percentile overall. Ultimately, K.I.D.S.determined that Karl presented a “mixed picture” and recommended that he“receive infant development services from the K.I.D.S. program targeting hisspeech/language, gross motor, and the delays in fine motor related to low muscletone.”Both parties’ experts agreed that the K.I.D.S. evaluation was “good andextensive,” but they disagreed as to the significance of the findings relativeto Karl’s neurological health. At the time Karl underwent his first evaluationfor his developmental delays, he was experiencing recurrent bouts of otitismedia and rashes that were later identified as erythema multiforme. The erythemamultiforme was first noticed on October 14. Tone is a measurement of themuscles’ ability to maintain the body in proper posture in different positions,such as sitting, standing, or being held. Normal tone means the muscles aremaintaining the body in proper posture. Low tone means the muscles do notsufficiently function to maintain the body in proper posture. Otitis media is“inflammation of the middle ear,” commonly known as an ear infection. Biopsyresults from December 28, 2004 confirmed that the rash was consistent witherythema multiforme. Erythema multiforme, which has rash-like symptoms, is“either of two conditions characterized by sudden eruption of erythematouspapules, some of which evolve into target 2004, a week before the K.I.D.S.testing. Thereafter, the record is replete with visits and telephone calls tothe Dickinson Clinic between October 2004 and January 2005 regarding Karl’sotitis media and erythema multiforme, documenting no fewer than eleven visitsand telephone calls during those few months. Dr. Robert Snodgrass, respondent’sexpert, sees significance in Karl’s erythema multiforme, not because childrenwith rashes are rare, but because erythema multiforme is relatively uncommon. Itis a hypersensitivity reaction, and in Karl’s case, it persisted for months.Moreover, both Dr. Snodgrass and Dr. Richard Frye, petitioners’ expert,testified that it is evidence of immune activation. It suggests that Karl wasunder some immune stress in the months leading up to the vaccinations on January19, 2005. Notably, the erythema multiforme improved after a physician, Dr. AmyOksa, prescribed Orapred, an immune suppressant drug, but recurred when Karlstopped taking it. Most of Karl’s medical record in November and December 2004centers on treating Karl’s otitis media and erythema multiforme. On December 27,2004, Karl saw Dr. McDonough for an ear check. The record of the visit statesthat Karl’s recent medical history, as reported by his parents, was “positivefor a fever.” At that time, Dr. McDonough also lesions consisting of a centralpapule surrounded by a discolored ring or rings. Both represent reactions of theskin and mucous membranes to factors such as viral skin infections . . . agents(including drugs) that are ingested or irritate the skin; [or] malignancy.”For its arguments, the government relies upon the testimony and reportssubmitted to the special master by its expert, Dr. Robert Snodgrass. Dr.Snodgrass is a professor of pediatrics and neurology at the University ofCalifornia, Los Angeles School of Medicine. He received a bachelor’s degree insocial relations from Harvard College and an M.D., magna cum laude, from HarvardMedical School. Dr. Snodgrass is board-certified in neurology, with specialcompetence in child neurology. He has written dozens of articles and has heldprofessorships at medical institutions associated with Harvard University,Cambridge University, the University of Southern California, StanfordUniversity, the University of Mississippi, and the University of California, LosAngeles.To support their contentions, the Palucks rely upon the testimony and reportssubmitted to the special master by their expert, Dr. Richard Frye. Dr. Frye isan assistant professor of pediatrics and neurology at the University of TexasHouston Health Science Center. He received a bachelor’s degree in psychobiologyfrom C.W. Post of Long Island University, a master’s degree in biomedicalscience/biostatistics from Drexel University, and both a Ph.D. in physiology andbiophysics and an M.D. from Georgetown University. Dr. Frye is board-certifiedin general pediatrics and in neurology with special competence in childneurology. He has published numerous articles and has held residencies orprofessorships affiliated with Harvard University, Boston University, theUniversity of Miami, the University of Florida, and the University of Texas.On January 6, 2005, the daycare noted that the K.I.D.S. Program worked with Karlfor thirty minutes, that Karl cried during “tummy time,” and that he seemed verytired that day. The next day, the daycare recorded that he was “crabby” in theafternoon. There are no other daycare notes describing Karl before thevaccinations.On January 19, 2005, Karl saw Dr. McDonough for his one year well-child checkup.Dr. McDonough administered DENVER II, a common developmental screening test. Theevaluation is recorded on a standardized form on which the doctor notes whethera child “passes” or “fails” certain developmental skills appropriate for his orher chronological age. On January 19, Karl passed “imitate activities,” “playball with examiner,” “indicate wants,” “bang 2 cubes held by hands,” “thumbfinger grasp,” “jabber,” say “dada/mama specific,” say “single syllables,” “pullto stand,” and “stand holding on.” Karl failed “get to sitting,” “stand 2[seconds],” “stand alone,” say “one word,” “wave bye-bye,” and “play pat acake.”Dr. Frye testified that Dr. McDonough incorrectly scored the DENVER II screeningfor some skills. Petitioners provided a standard DENVER II chart, which showsthat there is a shaded box behind each skill listed on the form. Dr. Fryeexplained that only when that shaded box ends before reaching the child’schronological age should the child be considered to have “failed” the skill. Theshaded box indicates what percentage of children have developed a skill at acertain chronological age. For example, the skill of saying “one word” isaccompanied by a shaded box that extends from about ten months to fifteenmonths. Only when a child turns 15 months and still cannot speak one word,should a child be noted as having “failed” the skill. Thus, according to Dr.Frye’s testimony, Karl’s only true failed skills should have been “get tositting,” “stand 2 [seconds],” and “play pat-a-cake.” Dr. Frye also noted thatsome of the skills Karl passed were fairly advanced for his age, such as“imitate activities,” which less than 75% of children can do at that age. Dr.Frye testified that Karl showed less of a delay at twelve months than he did atnine months. He estimated that Karl was about four or five months delayed inOctober based on the results of the K.I.D.S. evaluation, and about three monthsdelayed in January based on the DENVER II evaluation.At this same appointment, Dr. McDonough made additional findings regarding Karl.On a chart labeled “physical examination,” Dr. McDonough marked the category“neuromuscular” as abnormal, noting “muscle tone ↑ . . . upper . . . extremities. . . beats clonus [right ankle].” Dr. McDonough checked the category “hips” asnormal and wrote next to it some word or words followed by “ROM,” meaning rangeof motion. Dr. McDonough also wrote on the same chart that Karl “doesn’t holdcup well,” circled the word “babbles,” and next to “1-3 words,” he wrote “nowords.” He also circled the word “crawl” and wrote next to it “4 point” (i.e.,hands and knees). Finally, at this same appointment, Karl was given the MMR,varicella, and Prevnar vaccines.Within two days of receiving the vaccinations, Karl showed signs ofirritability, fever, and fatigue. His daycare recorded that he had a temperatureof 101.5 degrees on January 21, 2005, and recorded a temperature of 101.3degrees seven days later on January 28, 2005. Dr. Frye and Dr. Snodgrassdisagree over whether the vaccinations caused Karl’s subsequent and persistentfever. The daycare records in the two weeks following the vaccination revealthat Karl was often fussy, did not eat or nap well, and was tired. The onlypositive note occurred on February 3, 2005, when the daycare recorded that“Shiela from the K.I.D.S. [text missing].” There is some confusion overprecisely what Dr. McDonough wrote on the “neuromuscular” line of the chart. Dr.Snodgrass testified as follows on cross-examination:Q. If you look at that handwritten note of Dr. McDonough, he’s noting muscletone increase positive upper. He doesn’t say upper and lower, does he?A. I think he does. It’s kind of hard to read. Now I wouldn’t criticize anybodywho has trouble reading it, but if you look along that line it says muscle toneand there’s an arrow pointing up and a plus. Then it says upper and then you godown to the next line and you see L-O-W-E-R. To the left of the L-O-W-E-R issomething that I think is an ampersand sign, meaning upper and lower, and then Ithink you can clearly read extremities after you see lower.Frye maintained in testimony that the writing preceding “ROM” is the word“full,” meaning Karl’s hips showed a full range of motion. In contrast, Dr.Snodgrass stated that the writing preceding “ROM” indicated decreased range ofmotion. The word could also possibly be “good.” Based on other medical records,Dr. McDonough’s notation likely does not mean that Karl could successfullycomplete full cross-crawl movements.On February 8, 2005, the daycare noted that Karl was trying to crawl by “pullinghis body.” On February 7, 2005, the Palucks first took Karl to a chiropractor toaddress his problems sitting, crawling, and walking. On February 9, 2005, thechiropractor recorded some abnormalities with Karl’s hips on cross crawl. Karl’schiropractic record contains an entry for February 11, 2005 in which is writtenthe word “spastic.” There is significant disagreement between the parties overwhether the chiropractic records suggest decline or improvement through Februaryand March 2005. The subjective assessments noted in later entries are variable:• February 14—“better mood,”• February 16—“less rigid—more comfortable on all 4s”• February 18—“less rigid—‘happier’”• February 20—“stiff Mid + T—‘happy—moving around—til last nite & today’”• February 21—“Mid T tite & SOP—irritable”• February 24—“Spastic Mid T’s & ↓ Ts”• March 1—“No BM yesterday”• March 4—“BMs better—less fussy”• March 8—“less hypertonicity—[illegible] ↑ on all fours/BMs more regular”• March 10—“Not sleeping last night/2AM-5AM/irritable/good day yesterday”• March 17—“Upper [illegible] skin blotches—back pain.” On this day thechiropractor also noted, “palpation of spine [painful] baby cries loud whentouched.”• March 27—“rigid lower extreme. Palp. [illegible]—‘doing well ‘til yesterday’‘took a few crawl steps’”• March 30 (record of a phone conversation)—“Phone convers. w/ Brenda [Erie]SCSS Re. poss. abuse alleg. I responded—No—discussed poss. Adverse Rx/vaccine,CP [cerebral palsy], Cerebellar Tumor.”Although these entries are variable, they do not show any significantimprovement. Many of the comments in the records are written in quotes ordescribe Karl’s behavior outside his appointment, suggesting that they aredescriptions of his mood and behavior at home, given to the chiropractor by theKarl’s parents. For example, February 18: “happier,” February 20: “happy,” March27: “doing well ‘til yesterday,” “took a few crawl steps,” April 2: “good moodthis week” “seeing improvement.” A telephone conversation record with Dr.McDonough’s office dated March 22, 2005 documents the Palucks’ report that Karlhad “some brief crawling” and is “babbling more,” but is “not sitting on hisown,” “leans to one side.”On January 19, 2005, Dr. McDonough had referred Karl to physical andoccupational therapy. Dr. Frye described spasticity as “being the extreme forincreased tone.”Dr. Snodgrass found that the notations of Karl’s “brief crawling” and “babblingmore” were signs of progress since Karl’s December 27, 2004, visit with Dr.McDonough. This conclusion by the government’s expert was contrary to thatreached contemporaneously by Karl’s treating physician, Dr. McDonough, who notedon the same telephone record that he would make a referral to Dr. SiriwanKriengkrairut, a pediatric neurologist. On March 24, 2005, Dr. McDonough wrotethe consultation request, citing Karl’s “gross motor delay, global developmentaldelay, and hypertonicity” as the reasons. Global developmental delay is broaderthan isolated gross motor delay. “Global developmental delay is when you’reaffected in several areas.” (Frye). Dr. McDonough wrote that he “wouldappreciate [Dr. Kreingkrairut’s] evaluation and medical investigations into theetiology of [Karl’s] developmental delay and hypertonicity.”In mid to late March, Karl developed a cold. On March 28, 2005, he saw Dr. GaryPeterson at the Dickinson Clinic for “four days of [a] wheezy cough” and a“runny nose for two weeks.” The doctor noted early bilateral otitis media andbronchiolitis. He provided a SVN (nebulizer) treatment in the office and alsoprescribed one for use at home. He noted that Mrs. Paluck preferred “noantibiotics be written as yet since he has had the trouble with erythemamultiforme in the past.”By mid-April, Karl’s health was significantly worse than it was in January 2005.He continued to suffer from recurrences of otitis media. Karl saw Dr. McDonoughon April 13, 2005 for a Pre-Anesthesia Evaluation for a magnetic resonanceimaging (“MRI”) test that was to be performed on Karl. He noted “globaldevelopmental delay,” including problems with “speech and fine and gross motordevelopment.” Dr. McDonough also wrote that Karl’s “hips are tight withdecreased hip flexion to about 70 degrees bilaterally with increased [a wordappears to be absent, probably “tone”] in the lower extremities. This is achange of hip movement over the last couple of months.” Karl had not had anyevidence of erythema within the past three weeks.The neurologist, Dr. Kriengkrairut, examined Karl on April 19, 2005. Shedocumented a brief history of the onset of Karl’s problems. “According to thefather since [the onset of erythema multiforme in October 2004] the child hasregressed. . . . In December of 2004 his condition got worse. His hands and feetwere swelled up. He was given medications. This has markedly improved from amonth ago when he seemed back to his normal. Father reported that since he hasbeen improving with the skin lesions, he also made progress in terms ofdevelopment, but overall he is still behind.” Following the physicalexamination, she reported “truncal hypotonia with marked spasticity of theextremities. The baby has tendency to do cortical thumb bilaterally, worse onthe right compared to the left. . . . Baby does not babble. . . . Delayeddevelopment as well as hypotonia of the extremities may be secondary to centralnervous system pathology.” Overall, she labeled Karl as having “global delayeddevelopment.”Dr. Frye testified that this report by Dr. Kriengrairut suggests a substantialneurological regression in Karl since January 2005. Dr. Snodgrass disagreed thatthe problems observed by Dr. Kriengkrairut differed substantially from theproblems observed by Dr. McDonough in January.A chiropractic record entry from April 25, 2005, reports decreased range ofmotion. Dr. McDonough saw Karl the next day, on April 26, 2005, and wrote thatKarl “rolls over but does not sit without support. He does not crawl and doesnot say any words. . . . Hips are tight on range of motion.” Dr. McDonough againdescribed Karl as suffering from global developmental delay.Dr. Kriengkrairut had recommended an MRI of Karl’s brain, which was performed onApril 27, 2005. The results were initially interpreted as normal, but areexamination of the results from April 2005 following a more apparentlyabnormal MRI in July 2005 discerned evidence of a then-existing brainabnormality—thinning of the corporal callosum. The parties’ experts disagreed asto when the thinning most likely began. Dr. Frye opined that it occurred “recentto the MRI, after January 2005” (Frye), whereas Dr. Snodgrass testified that hehas “seen similar scans in people who had prenatal infections.”Karl declined further in the ensuing months. While the special master foundisolated instances of slight improvement, these events contrasted with a generaltrend of deterioration from April 2005 to July 2005. On May 4, 2005, Karl wasevaluated by a speech therapist, Ms. Trisha Getz. At that time, Karl had fewerlanguage skills than he had in October 2004, and his total language score was inthe first percentile (Frye). In October 2004, he could produce at least fourconsonant sounds, but by May 2005, he could no longer produce any consonantsounds, although he could still produce a couple vowel sounds. By May, Karl’sonly gesture was reaching for objects. Ms. Getz noted, “Karl’s parents report hehad an MRI last week, which has ‘wiped him out’ and they report a decrease inmany skills since undergoing the anesthesia. . . . Mom reports he has had adecrease in speech production in the last few months.” Her reports throughSeptember 8, 2005 indicate little to no improvement. (“very little progress” and“no goals met”). Karl continued to be unable to approximate sounds or produceany consonants.Karl suffered a seizure on July 12, 2005, followed by additional seizures overthe next two days. Dr. McDonough examined Karl on July 16, 2005 and assessed himas having “global developmental delay with seizure disorder, possibledeteriorating neurologic status in that he is unable to do some things that hewas able to do previously.” On July 19, 2005, Karl was admitted to Children’sHospital in St. Paul, Minnesota by Dr. Michael Frost. While there, MRI resultsshowed furthering thinning of the corporal callosum, strongly suggesting thatKarl was suffering from neurodegeneration. On October 27, 2005, Karl had anotherMRI, which showed no significant change in Karl’s brain since the July 2005 MRI.“The progression of signal changes between [4/27/05 and 7/22/05] may haverepresented evolution of one toxic/metabolic or hypotoxic ischemic event.”Since July 2005, Karl has lived in a state of severe neurological disability.Earlier in 2013, he was in dire health. “There is a ‘do not resuscitate ordernow in place’ for him, and ‘he is bedridden or wheelchair-ridden, has atracheotomy tube, and is on a ventilator to breathe for him.’”PRIOR DECISIONSPaluck IThe Palucks filed their petition for compensation on December 21, 2007, allegingthat Karl “sustained a permanent injury to his brain and central nervous systemas a result of receipt of his childhood vaccines . . . [and] that the exposureto childhood vaccines caused and/or aggravated a mitochondrial disorder inKarl.” Three hearings in the case were held over the course of 2010. At thehearings, the parties disagreed as to whether Karl’s vaccines caused oraggravated his neurodegenerative course. Dr. Frye testified that the vaccineseither caused Karl’s injury, or aggravated his condition, according to thefollowing theory:[V]accines, by intention, activate the immune system; this in turn leads to thedevelopment of potentially toxic elements within the body, namely reactiveoxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS); ROS and RNS areusually balanced under normal conditions by the (antioxidant) systems of thebody; however, if certain parts of the body, namely the mitochondria, are notworking properly, more toxic elements will be produced and will be unchecked byantioxidants, resulting in oxidative stress, leading to a cascade ofintracellular events leading to apoptosis or cellular death. Brain cells aremore vulnerable to this process and with death of brain cells, neurodegenerationand developmental regression are likely.Applying the theory to Karl’s case, Dr. Frye testified that Karl had anunderlying mitochondrial disorder that prevented him from coping with theoxidative stress of the vaccines. This led to “decompensation” within his cellsand eventually cellular death, resulting in neurodegeneration.Dr. Snodgrass disagreed, testifying that “there are problems with [Dr. Frye’s]theory in general and there are problems with its specific application to thecase of Karl Paluck.” He criticized Dr. Frye’s theory generally on the ground oflack of published peer-reviewed literature demonstrating that vaccines causeoxidative stress in humans, although he acknowledged supporting animal-modeldata. In his view also, Karl’s medical history did not support the idea thatvaccines caused or aggravated his condition. Dr. Snodgrass stated that Karlmanifested developmental delays before his vaccinations on January 19, 2005. Dr.Snodgrass additionally stated that between January and April 2005, Karl’scondition fluctuated, but did not worsen, as would be expected had the vaccinescaused Karl’s injury.The special master issued a decision denying compensation on December 14, 2011,concluding that petitioners had failed to prove by a preponderance of theevidence that the vaccines administered to Karl on January 19, 2005 caused hisinjury or significantly aggravated a preexisting condition. In so holding, thespecial master applied the three-prong causation framework set out in Althen,which requires a petitioner to show by preponderant evidence that thevaccination brought about [the] injury by providing: (1) a medical theorycausally connecting the vaccination and the injury; (2) a logical sequence ofcause and effect showing that the vaccination was the reason for the injury; and(3) a showing of a proximate temporal relationship between vaccination andinjury.The special master found that the Palucks had failed to carry their burden as toany of the three prongs.Regarding Althen’s first prong, the special master was not convinced by theevidence presented that vaccines produce oxidative stress generally or oxidativedamage particularly in persons with mitochondrial disorders. Regarding Althen’ssecond prong, the special master found that Karl’s history did not demonstrate alogical sequence of cause and effect between the vaccinations and Karl’s injury.According to the special master, Dr. Frye’s theory required that Karl’s medicalhistory evidence a continuous downward trajectory, which “did not match whatactually happened to Karl.” Instead, the special master credited Dr. Snodgrass’stestimony that Karl’s development fluctuated between September 2004 and April2005, with Karl actually improving between the time of his January 2005vaccinations and late March 2005. Regarding Althen’s third prong, the specialmaster concluded that oxidative damage would have occurred in Karl withinfourteen days, and that Karl’s immediate post-vaccination symptoms—fever,irritability, and, according to his chiropractor, spasticity andhypertonicity—did not evidence such damage. Finding that Karl did not manifestfurther neurological regression until April 2005, the special master determinedthat Karl’s injury fell outside the medically acceptable timeframe for vaccineinjury.Paluck IIPetitioners filed a motion for review of the special master’s decision in PaluckI on January 13, 2012, arguing that the special master’s conclusions on allthree Althen prongs were “arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, ornot otherwise in accord with the law.” The government urged affirmance.Oral argument was held on March 21, 2012. On April 18, 2012, this court vacatedthe special master’s findings of fact and conclusions of law, and remanded thecase to the special master for further proceedings. The court expressly did notmake any affirmative findings of fact of its own. The court reviewed the specialmaster’s determinations of law de novo, and his findings of fact for clearerror.First, the court directed the special master to reconsider whether petitioners’claim should be analyzed as a significant aggravation claim or a new injuryclaim. The special master had analyzed it using the standards applicable to anew injury claim without discussion of whether those standards were mostappropriate.Second, the court addressed the special master’s findings under each of thethree Althen prongs. Regarding Althen’s first prong, a medical theory causallyconnecting the vaccination and the injury, the court held that the specialmaster required a higher level of proof, i.e., a higher level of scientificcertainty, than is demanded by the Vaccine Act. The Vaccine Act does not requirethat “evidence be medically or scientifically certain.” To support his theory,Dr. Frye relied on a peer-reviewed study published in a well-respected medicaljournal, various studies showing oxidative stress in animals as a result ofvaccines, and a case study. While the special master correctly determined thatnone of the evidence was definitive proof of the medical validity of Dr. Frye’stheory, it was arbitrary and capricious for him to discard it as completely ashe did. The court also noted that Dr. Snodgrass did not dispute the reputabilityof the theory but only noted the dearth of human studies establishing it asfact. The court vacated the special master’s finding that petitioners failed toshow by a preponderance of the evidence that vaccines can cause oxidative stressand that children with mitochondrial disorders are particularly vulnerable tooxidative stress and directed the special master to reconsider the evidence inthe record under the correct legal standard. The court also vacated the specialmaster’s finding under Althen’s second prong that petitioners failed todemonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, a logical sequence of cause andeffect showing that the vaccinations caused Karl’s injury. The special masterhad given considerable weight to unexplained notations throughout the recordthat Karl was progressing in his ability to prepare to crawl through the monthsof February, March, and April, which was something he could not do at thecritical appointment on January 19, 2005 with Dr. McDonough, when he wasvaccinated. Karl was never formally evaluated as being able to crawl. At most,there was evidence that he was making some preparatory crawl motions at times.Similarly, the special master concluded that notations of babbling suggesteddevelopment throughout the same months, despite evidence that Karl actually lostlanguage abilities. Moreover, the court opined that the special master failedfully to consider the chiropractor’s records from February and March and Dr.McDonough’s referral to a pediatric neurologist in March. The court held thatthe special master’s finding that Karl’s efforts to crawl and babbling signaledimprovement, therefore negating a logical sequence of cause and effect betweenKarl’s vaccines and injury, should be vacated due to a failure to consider allof the salient evidence.Lastly, the court vacated the special master’s finding regarding Althen’s thirdprong, a proximate temporal relationship between the vaccination and injury.According to the special master, the medical literature suggested that themedically acceptable interval between vaccination and the onset of symptoms ofneurological injury would be two weeks. The court rejected this conclusion.Given the medical literature relied upon by Dr. Frye, including a case studydemonstrating neurodegeneration occurring post-vaccination over a period ofseveral months and a published study showing neurodegeneration occurringfollowing infection in patients with mitochondrial disorders over a periodextending to nineteen days, it was arbitrary and capricious for the specialmaster to set a “hard and fast limit of two weeks.” The court also held that thespecial master’s finding that Karl did not manifest any symptoms of neurologicinjury within a medically acceptable interval after the vaccination wasarbitrary and capricious because it failed to consider the record as a whole.Paluck IVBefore deciding the case on remand, the special master requested supplementalbriefing and any additional evidence from the parties regarding theclassification of Karl’s injury as a new injury or a significant aggravationclaim. If the claim were found to be a significant aggravation claim, then theLoving factors would apply, which combine the three Althen causation factorswith three additional factors that inquire into the claimant’s condition beforeand after the vaccination. Both parties submitted supplemental briefs, butneither submitted additional evidence. The special master determined that Karl’sclaim is one of significant aggravation and must be analyzed under the sixLoving factors because Karl’s developmental delays in the autumn of 2005strongly suggested pre-existing problems with his central nervous system.The first prong of Loving requires addressing Karl’s condition prior tovaccination. The parties agreed that Karl’s mitochondrial defect was likelyaffecting his health before the vaccinations. The parties disagreed over theextent of delay in Karl’s language skills and the cause of Karl’s gross motordelays. The special master found that the “preponderant weight of the evidencefavors finding that Karl’s language development was delayed prior to hisvaccination.” He also found that Karl’s gross motor delays and language delays,in existence before the vaccinations, were caused by abnormalities in hiscentral nervous system. He further determined that Karl’s gross motor skilldelays had worsened between December 27, 2004 and January 19, 2005.The second prong concerns Karl’s condition following the vaccination. Thespecial master extensively summarized Karl’s records in the months following thevaccination. He looked to Karl’s daycare records, Karl’s chiropractic record,Dr. McDonough’s referral to the pediatric neurologist, Dr. Kriengkrairut’sneurological exam, Karl’s MRI in April 2005, Karl’s speech therapy records, theseizures and hospitalization in July 2005, and Karl’s other medical visits andmitochondrial testing.The third prong of Loving asks whether Karl’s current condition constitutes asignificant aggravation of his condition prior to the vaccine. Withoutelaboration, the special master found that “by virtually any metric, Karl wasworse” after receiving the vaccines.The fourth prong of Loving, which correlates to the first prong of Althen,addresses whether there is a medical theory causally connecting the worsenedcondition to the vaccine. In response to this court’s opinion in Paluck II,“both parties essentially agreed that the Palucks’ evidence met the standard formedical plausibility as defined by the court.” The special master accepted thisapparent concession by the government without discussion, noting only that thisconcession does not lessen the petitioners’ burden of proof under Loving prongsfive and six.The fifth prong of Loving requires petitioners to establish, by a preponderanceof the evidence, a logical sequence of cause and effect showing that thevaccination significantly aggravated Karl’s condition. The special masterdetermined that Dr. Frye’s theory “was predicated on a downhill trajectory.”Thus, the special master looked for evidence that Karl’s health declined withoutany improvement from one day to the next following the vaccinations on January19, 2005. In accordance with this court’s order on remand, the special masterconsidered in detail “Karl’s chiropractic records, Karl’s treating doctors’statements regarding the cause of Karl’s decline, and Dr. McDonough’s referralto a pediatric neurologist.” In considering the chiropractor’s notations fromFebruary and March, the special master found that it was “difficult to gleanmuch significance from them.” Ultimately, he found that the evidence of declinewas too variable to suggest a linear decline, as he considered Dr. Frye’s theoryto require.The final prong of Loving requires the special master to determine a medicallyacceptable temporal relationship between the vaccine and the significantaggravation and then determine whether the claimant’s injuries occurred withinthat time frame. Upon reconsideration of an article by Dr. Joseph L. Edmonds,the special master lengthened the medically acceptable temporal interval fromtwo weeks, which he had specified in Paluck I, to three weeks. Accordingly, thespecial master looked for evidence of neurodegeneration, defined as the loss ofa skill, within three weeks following January 19, 2005, which extended toFebruary 10, 2005. Karl’s daycare records and chiropractic records were the onlyrecords contemporaneously created during that period. The special master waspersuaded by the government’s expert that Karl’s fevers and irritability in theten days following the vaccinations did not constitute encephalopathy, as Dr.Frye had opined. Additionally, the special master was unconvinced by Dr. Frye’stestimony that the chiropractor’s notation describing Karl as “spastic” onFebruary 11, 2005 was evidence of “a very severe neurological event suggesting avery rapid change in his central nervous system.”The special master posited three reasons for not relying on the chiropractor’snotation: in his view, (1) spasticity is closely related to hypertonia, whichDr. McDonough noticed on January 19, 2005, (2) chiropractors are notsufficiently well trained to recognize clinical spasticity in infants, and (3)the variability of the chiropractor’s records rendered them unreliable. Thespecial master also placed emphasis on the fact that Karl did not appear to stayhome from daycare in February, nor did he see doctors with the same frequency hehad in December, although he saw the chiropractor frequently.Overall, the special master concluded that Karl had not been as sick in Februaryas he was in December. The special master concluded that the petitioners couldnot show by a preponderance of the evidence that Karl manifested evidence ofneurological degeneration within the three-week “bound of the appropriatetemporal limit.”Based upon a failure of proof respecting the fifth and sixth prongs of Loving,the special master denied entitlement to compensation.STANDARDS FOR REVIEWUnder the Vaccine Act, the court may “set aside any findings of fact orconclusions of law of the special master found to be arbitrary, capricious, anabuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law and issue its ownfindings of fact and conclusions of law.” The special master’s determinations oflaw are reviewed de novo. The special master’s findings of fact are reviewed forclear error. “We uphold the special master’s findings of fact unless they arearbitrary or capricious” (citing Capizzano v. Secretary of Health & HumanServs.).Under Vaccine Rule 8(b) (1), the special master must “consider all relevant andreliable evidence.” Vaccine Rule 8(b) (1); see also 42 U.S.C. § 300aa-13(b) (1)“The special master or court shall consider the entire record and the cause ofthe injury, disability, illness, or condition until the date of the judgment ofthe special master or court.” A special master’s findings regarding theprobative value of the evidence and the credibility of witnesses will not bedisturbed so long as they are “supported by substantial evidence.” Doe v.Secretary of Health & Human Servs. (citing Whitecotton).As this court stated previously, a deferential standard of review “is not arubber stamp.” The special master must “consider the relevant evidence ofrecord, draw plausible inferences and articulate a rational basis for thedecision.” And, while the special master need not address every snippet ofevidence adduced in the case, he cannot dismiss so much contrary evidence thatit appears that he “simply failed to consider genuinely the evidentiary recordbefore him” (Campbell v. Secretary of Health & Human Servs.).ANALYSISThere is no dispute that Karl’s claim involves an “off-Table” injury, i.e., aninjury or aggravated condition that is not listed on the Vaccine Injury Tableset out at 42 U.S.C. § 300aa-14(a). Accordingly, petitioners must provecausation in fact. The special master concluded that petitioners’ claim is mostappropriately analyzed as a significant-aggravation claim governed by the Lovingfactors. Petitioners continue to contest classification of the claim as asignificant-aggravation claim rather than a new-injury claim, notwithstandingthe circumstance that the special master found that the factors relatedspecifically to significant aggravation had been satisfied. Petitioners alsocontest the special master’s conclusions primarily respecting Loving prongs fiveand six, i.e., logical sequence of cause and effect and medically acceptabletemporal interval, respectively. The government urges affirmance of the specialmaster’s findings.New Injury or Significant AggravationThe Vaccine Act defines “significant aggravation” as “any change for the worsein a preexisting condition which results in markedly greater disability, pain,or illness accompanied by substantial deterioration of health.” After giving theparties an opportunity to file supplemental briefs and giving them anopportunity to present more evidence, the special master concluded that thepreponderance of the evidence weighed in favor of finding that petitioners’claim should be analyzed as a significant-aggravation claim. Petitionersmaintain that Karl’s neurodegeneration constitutes a new injury, distinct fromany delays he might have been experiencing in the months before the vaccination.The government avers that Karl’s neurodegeneration can only be properly analyzedas a significant-aggravation claim because he already showed signs ofdevelopmental delay before the vaccination. Whether petitioners’ claim should beclassified as a new injury or significant-aggravation claim rests on the “theprecise definition of Karl’s injury, which is a precondition to identifying thetiming of its symptoms” and “whether indicia of Karl’s neurodegenerationfollowed the typical course of a person that suffers from his type ofmitochondrial defect.” In its remand opinion, this court sought elucidation ofwhether developmental delays were the best indicator of neurological injury insomeone with a mitochondrial defect. The special master, on remand, specificallyasked the parties to address Karl’s “neurological, not mitochondrial, symptoms”before the vaccination.The government responded that “one cannot separate ‘mitochondrial symptoms’ fromthe symptoms related to mitochondrial disorder-affected organs, including thecentral nervous system.”Petitioners, however, pointed to pieces of evidence in the record to show thatKarl first exhibited neurological symptoms after the vaccinations, including thechiropractor’s records from February and March 2005, the K.I.D.S. evaluation,the April 2005 MRI, and the April 2005 neurological assessment.The experts disagree about the significance each of these pieces of evidence.Petitioners emphasized the October 2004 K.I.D.S. evaluation which found “Karl’sbrain to be functioning within normal limits” and attributed Karl’s gross motordelay to low muscle tone. Dr. Frye testified that the K.I.D.S. evaluation wassignificant because it showed that Karl’s cognitive abilities were unimpaired inOctober 2004. In his view, the concern was Karl’s low muscle tone, not hiscentral nervous system. He further explained that this low muscle tone was mostlikely due to Karl’s then-undiagnosed mitochondrial disorder. Dr. Frye testifiedthat although Karl’s language skills were below average according to the PLS-3test, the delay was minimal. His combined standard score for the PLS-3 was 96,and Dr. Frye testified that the average is 100. “Ninety-six is very close to 100on these scales.” According to Dr. Frye, “Karl’s delays were most prominentlygross motor delays, maybe a little bit of fine motor delays, but cognition,language was absolutely normal . . . His ability to make language sounds and tointeract with others, to be attentive to what was going on in the room, this wasall very important and shows that his brain and cognition were working.”Dr. Snodgrass disagreed without elaboration. He opined that describing Karl as“right at the average” was not accurate and that the K.I.D.S. evaluation did notshow Karl’s cognition and language as “absolutely normal,” as Dr. Fryedescribed.In turning to the chiropractor’s notation of spasticity in February 2005, thecortical thumbing noted in April 2005, and the MRI results from April 2005, theexperts disagreed over the significance of all three of these. In short, Dr.Frye found all three to be evidence of sudden neurological regression after thevaccinations, and Dr. Snodgrass found them to be either a continuation of thesame problems that existed before the vaccinations or insignificant.The experts disputed the value of the chiropractic records in determining Karl’sneurological state in February and March. In particular, they disagreed over thesignificance of the chiropractor’s notation of “spastic” on February 11, 2005.Dr. Frye testified that the chiropractor’s finding of spasticity “suggests avery severe neurological event, and that suggests . . . that there was veryrapid change in his central nervous system.” Dr. Snodgrass saw no specialsignificance in that record, testifying that “they [the chiropractic clinic]often say spastic, stiff, et cetera. So they are reporting on the same generalphenomenon which first became evident to Dr. McDonough in January . . . I thinkthat a chiropractor would have some idea of what spastic means, but notnecessarily the same that a physician would. And I think when you’re talkingabout a 13- or 14-month-old child, I don’t think chiropractors are in a positionto make any nuanced statements about them. . . . I don’t believe they aretrained to evaluate infants.”The experts also disputed the importance of Dr. Kriengkrairut’s finding ofcortical thumbing in April 2005. Dr. Frye called it a “significant sign ofadvanced upper motor neuron lesions and something that you don’t see with justsome type of change in tone or even mild spasticity; that is a very significantfinding.” He considered that the cortical thumbing, in addition to being a signof neurological change, demonstrated an impairment occurring since December2004, when Karl was able to open his hands and grab wrapping paper at Christmas(Frye). Dr. Snodgrass disagreed that the problems observed by Dr. Kriengkrairutdiffered substantially from the problems observed by Dr. McDonough in January2005. “The function recorded in January by Dr. McDonough is the same functionthat was recorded by Dr. Kriengkrairut in April and by Dr. McDonough when heagain saw Karl in April.” Dr. Snodgrass testified that cortical thumbing is nota significant finding and is not one he would have expected Dr. McDonough, apediatrician, to note. Upon further questioning by the special master, Dr.Snodgrass stated that thumbing is abnormal in a one-year-old, but in the contextof also seeing increased tone, it is insignificant. He further stated that thethumbing was not necessarily “cortical,” and thus was not necessarilyrepresentative of a brain abnormality.Lastly, regarding the April 2005 MRI, Dr. Snodgrass and Dr. Frye both concedethat it showed evidence of thinning of the corporal callosum, but Dr. Snodgrasstestified that that thinning could have been present since birth, whereas Dr.Frye testified that it most likely occurred close in time to the MRI, after theJanuary 2005 vaccinations.Whether Karl’s severe neurodegeneration would have eventually resulted from hismitochondrial defect without the vaccinations posed a vexing issue. Thegovernment and petitioners appear to agree that mitochondrial disorders are “aheterogeneous group of disorders characterized by impaired energy production dueto genetically based oxidative phosphorylation dysfunction.” They also agreethat manifestations of mitochondrial diseases are variable. The governmentmaintains that “the aggravation of symptoms as Karl aged stemmed from thenatural progression of the disease.”The special master asked Dr. Frye what he would think if a hypothetical child,with Karl’s same genetic makeup and medical history, experienced the sameneurodegeneration as Karl, without having received any vaccinations. Dr. Fryeresponded that he would immediately look for some other trigger, such as a badinfection or a bad viral illness because it would be very puzzling to see such aregression with no identifiable cause.Dr. Snodgrass stated that “mitochrondrial problems are heterogeneous. . . . Theyvary enormously.”The evidentiary record is bereft of any basis for a natural progression of amitochrondrial condition to the severely debilitating point Karl experienced.The special master acknowledged that it was possible that Karl’s gross motordelays were purely related to low muscle tone and not his central nervoussystem, but he believed three reasons supported finding that Karl hadpreexisting neurodegeneration allegedly significantly aggravated by thevaccines. First, it is generally accepted that there is a connection betweenmuscle tone and the nervous system. Second, Karl showed delay in his expressivelanguage according to the K.I.D.S. evaluation in October 2004. Third, thespecial master pointed to the Palucks’ Amended Petition, filed October 17, 2008,stating that they allege that the vaccines “caused a ‘significant aggravation’of Karl’s underlying mitochondrial disorder, leading to . . . subsequentneurodevelopmental regression.”The special master’s reasoning in finding evident neurodegeneration prior to thevaccinations is partially but not fully supported by the record. The partiesaccepted that the central nervous system helps maintain muscle tone, but theexperts did not agree that low muscle tone is necessarily a result of a problemin the central nervous system. Dr. Frye testified that Karl’s gross motor delayswere attributable to “problems with muscle development, and energy that themuscle needs, because of his [then-undiagnosed] mitochondrial disorder.” Thistestimony is corroborated by the contemporaneous finding by the K.I.D.S.evaluators that Karl’s delays were likely a result of low muscle tone. It isalso corroborated by the fact that Dr. McDonough did not recommend that Karl seea neurologist until late March. If low muscle tone was necessarily caused by aproblem in the central nervous system, that would have been evidence that theK.I.D.S. evaluators and Dr. McDonough should have been and actually wereconcerned about neurological causes from October 2004 onwards. Contrastingly,Dr. Snodgrass nonetheless opined that Karl’s gross motor delays and observed lowmuscle tone were secondary to undiagnosed problems in his central nervoussystem. Although Dr. Snodgrass’s opinion is plausible, it is supported by thecontemporaneous medical records only insofar as Dr. McDonough’s examination ofKarl on January 19, 2005 indicated “two beats clonus [right ankle].”The special master’s emphasis on Karl’s language delay as evidence ofpre-vaccination neurodegeneration is minimally supported by the record. There isevidence of delay, but the delay is moderate at most. Petitioners assert therewas absolutely no cognitive or language delay. Karl tested within normal limitson the Bayley Scales and tested slightly below average on the PLS-3 scales. Karlwas, however, referred to speech therapy by the K.I.D.S. program evaluators.There is room for debate over whether Karl’s language skills were actually“delayed,” and the special master could have reasonably concluded that beingbelow average, even just slightly, constitutes delay, but to label that delay asevidence of then-existing problems in the central nervous system stretchesinference from the evidence too far. In stating that “expressive language tends,at least in the absence of other identified causes, to be considered a CentralNervous System problem,” the special master only cites Dr. Snodgrass’s testimonythat “alludes” to such a connection between expressive language and CNS. Anycognitive and language delays that Karl had were mild prior to the vaccinationand were not of strong concern. To find that these delays definitivelyrepresented a “CNS problem” is not supported by substantial evidence.The special master commented that “special masters ‘can always rule on a factualissue no matter how scanty the evidence is,’” but that recitation is not alicense to ignore the record. In this instance, substantial contemporaneousmedical records exist. The four-month and six-month evaluations by Dr.McDonough, the records of illness with otitis media and erytherma multiforme,and especially the K.I.D.S. evaluative results provide significant informationabout Karl’s condition pre-vaccination. These records suggest that no onebelieved or even suspected Karl’s problems were neurological in nature untilafter the vaccinations. The special master is not free to decide otherwise inthe face of this evidence.Despite these flaws, the special master’s conclusion that petitioners’ claim isone of significant aggravation and not new injury will not be disturbed. It isevident that Karl faced a multitude of setbacks in the fall. He was not acompletely healthy child when he received the vaccinations. He had anundiagnosed mitochondrial disorder that was causing developmental delays in someareas, and he was experiencing repeated stresses to his immune system in theform of persistent otitis media and erythema multiforme. Given this, the ankleclonus might, but does not necessarily, represent neurological injury. Oncross-examination, Dr. Snodgrass explained that a severely agitated child “whois screaming his head off” might have clonus. Petitioners’ counsel asked Dr.Snodgrass whether two beats of clonus is “mild clonus.” Dr. Snodgrass replied,“I think that depends on the circumstance. I think the basic issue is it’sclonus, which was not present before.” Upon further questioning, Dr. Snodgrassresponded, “Well, it’s—two beats of clonus is less than say five. But it’s stillnot normal.”Evidence that Karl’s immune system was not functioning optimally, the courtconcurs that petitioners’ claim is more appropriately analyzed as one ofsignificant aggravation. It is not necessary to find with specificity thatKarl’s gross motor delays were neurological rather than musculoskeletal innature prior to the vaccinations. If Karl’s problems prior to the vaccinationson January 19, 2005, were neurological, the impairment was small and not evidentto the treating physicians. Given petitioners’ claim that the vaccineoverwhelmed Karl’s immune system, causing cell death, it is enough to find thatKarl’s body was under immune stress in the months leading up to the vaccinationsand that his underlying mitochondrial defect made his body less able to respondto immune stressors. Thus, petitioners’ claim is properly analyzed as one ofsignificant aggravation and not new injury.Loving FactorsAfter determining that petitioners’ claim is more properly analyzed as asignificant aggravation claim, the special master applied the Loving test. Thecourt concurs that the Loving test applies and requires preponderant proof of:(1) the person’s condition prior to administration of the vaccine, (2) theperson’s current condition (or the condition following the vaccination if thatis also pertinent), (3) whether the person’s current condition constitutes a‘significant aggravation’ of the person’s condition prior to vaccination, (4) amedical theory causally connecting such a significantly worsened condition tothe vaccination, (5) a logical sequence of cause and effect showing that thevaccination was the reason for the significant aggravation, and (6) a showing ofa proximate temporal relationship between the vaccination and the significantaggravation.Loving Prong 1—Condition Prior to the Vaccinations: The special master foundthat “overall, by January 19, 2005, Karl had problems in his CNS. Hispediatrician diagnosed him with gross motor delays, which had worsened in thepreceding three weeks. Karl was also having problems with his language. Finally,Karl was recovering from the most recent episode of erythema multiforme.”Petitioners contest the special master’s findings regarding Karl’s conditionbefore the vaccinations as arbitrary and capricious and not in accord with thelaw. First, they challenge the special master’s interpretation of Dr.Snodgrass’s testimony as meaning that the erythema multiforme was anotherpossible cause of the neurodegeneration. Second, they dispute the specialmaster’s finding that Karl had expressive language delay that, “in the absenceof other identified causes, is to be considered a CNS problem.” Third,petitioners question the special master’s finding that Karl’s developmentaldelays worsened between December 2004 and January 2005, contending that thespecial master ignored Dr. Frye’s testimony to the contrary.The government asserts that the special master’s conclusions of fact, includinghis conclusion that Karl’s delays prior to January 2005 represented a problemwith his central nervous system, are supported by appropriate evidence.The special master recounted the evidentiary record in his analysis of Karl’scondition prior to the vaccinations. He considered both the contemporaneousmedical records and the expert testimony regarding Karl’s recurrent erythemamultiforme, finding that it was evidence of chronic activation of Karl’s immunesystem.The dispute over whether Karl’s language abilities were delayed poses adifferent type of issue. As discussed supra, reasonable minds could differ overwhether Karl could or should be classified as having had a speech delay beforethe vaccinations. Consequently, the special master could properly conclude thatKarl had speech delays. On the other hand, there is no evidence that thosespeech delays were necessarily a result of neurological problems. As discussedsupra regarding the propriety of a significant-aggravation analysis, thecontemporaneous records do not suggest that Karl’s treating physicians andtherapists believed that any extant pre-vaccination speech delay wasneurological in nature.Regarding Karl’s gross motor delays, the special master found that theyrepresented problems in his central nervous system before the January 19, 2005vaccinations. In support, the special master compares Dr. McDonough’s findingsin December 2004, that Karl had normal muscle tone and no ankle clonus, to hisfindings in January 2005, that Karl had increased tone and two beats of clonusin his right ankle. This evidence supports the special master’s conclusion thatKarl’s physical condition had worsened between December 2004 and January 2005. Areport by the same doctor that Karl went from normal muscle tone to increasedmuscle tone and from no ankle clonus to two beats of ankle clonus is compelling.Again, however, the special master’s conclusion that this worsening isnecessarily a result of problems with Karl’s central nervous system steps beyondthe inferences that can permissibly be drawn from the medical evidence. AlthoughKarl’s medical problems make this case a significant-aggravation claim ratherthan a new-injury claim, there is very little direct evidence.The special master questioned whether the erytherma multiforme could have causedKarl’s eventual neurodegeneration but determined that “resolution of thisquestion is not necessary because . . . Karl did not significantly decline inthe weeks immediately following January 19, 2005, when he both received a set ofvaccinations and suffered another bout of erythema multiforme.” This latterobservation foreshadows the special master’s analysis of Loving prong six,addressed.December 27, 2004, Dr. McDonough saw Karl when his parents brought him into theclinic for otitis media and possible erythema multiforme. Under “DevelopmentalHistory” Dr. McDonough recorded, possibly based upon discussion with Karl’sparents that “he has several words that he says.” On January 19, 2005, however,he recorded that Karl had no words, except for “mama” and “dada.” No otherevidence suggests that Karl ever had any words beyond “mama” and “dada,” and, assuch, the descriptive statement in Dr. McDonough’s report of December 27, 2004is uncorroborated that Karl’s condition before the vaccinations had aneurological foundation. Certainly his treating medical providers did not thinkit was neurological at the time. Thus, the evidence shows that Karl had grossmotor delays and speech delays, but it does not support finding that thosedelays were caused by a significant impairment of his central nervous system. Ifhis central nervous system was adversely affected, any such disability was not amajor one.Loving Prong 2—Condition Following the Vaccinations: Loving prong two inquiriesinto the claimant’s current condition or condition following the vaccinations.As the special master noted, because Karl’s current condition is not at issue,the focus turns to his condition in the six months following receipt of thevaccines. Two days after the vaccinations, Karl’s daycare recorded that he had atemperature of 101.5 degrees. For the next week, Karl reportedly acted tired andfussy. On January 28, nine days after the vaccinations, Karl still had a feverof 101.3, as recorded by his daycare. The experts disagree as to the cause ofthe fever. Dr. Frye testified that the fever was a symptom of immune activationcaused by the vaccinations on January 19, 2005. Dr. Frye also opined that Karl’ssymptoms in late January and early February indicated the first signs of thebiological processes that eventually led to Karl’s neurological regression(describing Karl’s post-vaccination symptoms as manifesting encephalopathy). Dr.Snodgrass disagreed, stating that the fever on January 21 manifested too quicklyto be attributed to the vaccines, that the continued fever on January 28 wasmore likely due to an outbreak of Karl’s erythema multiforme, and that thefevers in any event were not related to Karl’s neurological decline. Karl’sdaycare records, which extend through February 8th, largely describe him asbeing tired, irritable, and fussy. Karl’s chiropractic records, which begin onFebruary 7, 2005, describe Karl as “irritable” on February 9th and then“spastic” on February 11, 2005. The next three visits suggest some slightprogress, but the chiropractor’s assessment of Karl’s condition remained thesame. The following visits noted increased stiffening and spasticity, with theassessment of Karl’s condition remaining the same. The first visits of Marchagain indicated some slight progress, but the remaining three visits in Marchshowed a decline and decreased range of motion. In April, Karl’s conditioncontinued to be variable. The K.I.D.S. evaluation pointed specifically to lowmuscle tone, and Dr. McDonough did not refer Karl to a neurologist until lateMarch 2005, two months after the vaccination, following reports that Karl wasdeteriorating further. Dr. Snodgrass testified that the MMR vaccine introduces avirus into the body that grows with time. Those viruses “will present a largerstimulus at seven to ten days than they do on day 1, 2, or 3.” This is unlike akilled bacteria vaccine, which does not multiply in the body and causesreactions more quickly. Karl’s daycare noted the reappearance of spots on hisarms and legs on January 31, 2005. The chiropractor’s records document adecline, albeit not a linear one. The observation by the chiropractor that hewas “spastic” is significant. That Karl was a little less spastic or stiff somedays than others does not mean that Karl’s condition improved beyond his initialappointments in early February. This is consistent with Dr. Frye’s theory thatKarl was likely experiencing changes at the cellular level that would take timeto appear at the clinical observation level. Moreover, there was a phoneconversation between Brenda Erie of Stark County Social Services and thechiropractor on March 30, 2005, reproduced below, where the chiropractordiscussed possible causes for Karl’s condition, including abuse, adversereaction to medication or a vaccine, cerebral palsy, or a cerebellar tumor: Thespecial master read this record as indicating that “the chiropractor answered‘No’” to the possibility that an adverse reaction to the vaccination might havecaused Karl’s deteriorating condition. In the hearing held by the court onSeptember 18, 2013, the government acknowledged that the special master misreadthis record. The chiropractor said “No” to child abuse allegations, not to thepossibility of an adverse reaction to a medication, cerebral palsy, or acerebellar tumor.On March 24, 2005, Dr. McDonough referred Karl to a neurologist. This occurredtwo days after a phone call between Dr. McDonough and the Palucks, during whichthe Palucks reported that Karl had some brief crawling, was not sitting on hisown, leans to one side, is babbling more, and has an intermittent rash. This isthe first time in the record that anyone recommended Karl see a neurologist. Atthat point, Dr. McDonough could not have thought Karl had improved since theJanuary vaccinations.On March 28, 2005, Karl had a bout of otitis media and bronchiolitis, documentedby Dr. Gary Peterson. A week later, Karl’s symptoms were improving in thatregard and the doctor recommended weaning him off the nebulizer that he had beenusing to treat the bronchiolitis. On April 13, Karl saw Dr. McDonough for apre-anesthesia appointment in preparation for his planned MRI. At that point,Dr. McDonough noted “increased tone in the upper and lower extremities,” noclonus, “decreased hip flexion to about 70 degrees bilaterally,” no speech, and“global developmental delay with resolving otitis media.” Dr. McDonoughdescribed the decreased hip flexion as “a change in hip movement over the lastcouple months.” He also documented his hope that “the parents would agree toevaluation for congenital infections, metabolic disorders, and other testsrequested by Dr. Kriengkrairut for his global developmental delay.”Dr. Frye testified that this examination represented a neurological decline inKarl “because now he has increased tone in the upper and lower extremities,so—and he says, ‘Global developmental delay with resolving otitis media.’ Sohere his concerns are that his neurological exam has gotten worse” since January2005. Dr. Frye further opined that Dr. McDonough’s suspicion of a metabolicdisorder was consistent with a finding of increased tone. Increased tonesuggested damage to the cortex of the brain, which can be seen in white-matterabnormalities in an MRI.Dr. Snodgrass disagreed that the examination on April 13th evidenced significantchange, stating that while the hip flexion is more severely limited, it waspresent in January in any case.On April 19, 2005, Karl saw the pediatric neurologist, Dr. Kriengkrairut. Shereported “truncal hypotonia with marked spasticity of the extremities. The babyhas tendency to do cortical thumb bilaterally, worse on the right compared tothe left. . . . Baby does not babble. . . . Delayed development as well ashypotonia of the extremities may be secondary to central nervous systempathology.”Dr. Frye testified that this report by Dr. Kriengkrairut suggests substantialworsening in Karl. “This is a third medical provider talking about spasticity,not just some subtle increases in tone. She actually says on the motor exam‘marked spasticity.’ This is very, very different than just a subtle change intone.” Dr. Frye also explained that hypotonia, cortical thumbing, and cessationof babbling all represent neurological regression. Dr. Snodgrass disagreed. Heconsidered that Dr. Kriengkrairut’s exam revealed no new neurological problemsin Karl. In his view, cortical thumbing was not a significant finding. He alsostated that the thumbing was not necessarily “cortical” and thus was notnecessarily representative of a brain abnormality. Dr. Snodgrass’s criticalcommentary on Dr. Kriengkrairut’s findings appears to have had two objectives,first, to suggest that Karl’s neurological condition in April 2005 was notsubstantially different from his condition before the vaccinations, and, second,to suggest that Karl’s neurological condition was not deteriorating. Bothimplications have no support in the contemporaneous medical records. Karl’spediatrician, Dr. McDonough, in March had referred Karl to Dr. Kriengkrairut fora detailed neurological examination because of perceived neurologicalabnormalities. Dr. Kriengkrairut found multiple indicia of “central nervoussystem pathology.” What Dr. McDonough had suspected was in fact borne out by Dr.Kriengkrairut. The spasticity first observed by the chiropractor in earlymid-February, shortly after the vaccinations, was still evident, along withother neurological abnormalities. By April, Karl was regressing markedly.In summary, the court finds that Karl had significant signs of neurodegenerationby the end of April, as evidenced by the marked spasticity, cortical thumbing,and lack of babbling observed by Dr. Kriengkrairut, the decreased hip flexionand “global developmental delay” noted by Dr. McDonough, and the belatedlydiagnosed abnormal MRI exam from April 27, 2005.In May 2005, Karl saw a speech therapist. Karl made no progress throughout Mayregarding his speech, and the therapist’s records show that Karl had lost skillssince October 2004. He could no longer produce consonant sounds, but continuedto be able to reach for desired toys. Karl’s evaluation in September 2005stated, “No goals met.”On July 12, 2005, Karl experienced his first seizure. Upon discharge from theMed Center One Hospital in Bismarck, Dr. McDonough noted that he had “globaldevelopmental delay with seizure disorder, possible deteriorating neurologicstatus in that he is unable to do some things that he was able to dopreviously.” On July 19, 2005, Karl saw Dr. Michael Frost at St. Paul Children’sHospital in Minnesota. His medical history from that appointment notes that Karl“has been receiving therapies with some intermittent decreased tone but overallhe is declining in all areas.” It also notes that by fourteen months, i.e, March15, 2005, Karl showed no signs of significant developmental progress. Dr. Frostnoted that Karl was being admitted for a determination of what the etiologymight be for his deteriorating neurological status. Dr. Frost believed, after asecond MRI in July, that Karl was experiencing neurodegeneration. A third MRIperformed in October 2005 showed that the thinning of Karl’s corporal callosumhad stabilized, suggesting that there may have been a toxic or metabolic eventhe experienced that had also stabilized. In short, Karl’s condition followingthe vaccinations reflected marked neurodegeneration.Loving Prong 3—Whether the post-vaccination condition constitutes a significantaggravation of the pre-vaccination condition: By October 2005, Karl had “nopurposeful movements. He had increased tone throughout and increased deep tendonreflexes throughout with multiple beats of clonus at the ankles.” He had nospecific smiling or distinctive eye contact. This condition starkly contrasts tothe previously “very happy” child, that was “aware and tuned into faces” and who“enjoyed interactive play.” The special master properly concluded thatsubstantial evidence showed that Karl was indisputably worse in the monthsfollowing his vaccination. The parties do not dispute this finding, and thecourt concurs that substantial evidence supports the special master’sconclusion.Loving Prong 4 (Althen Prong 1)—Whether there is a medical theory causallyconnecting the significantly worsened condition to the vaccination: The specialmaster found that petitioners satisfied their burden of proof as to Loving prongfour (Althern prong one), i.e., in showing that a medical theory causallyconnected Karl’s worsened condition to the vaccination. The special mastersuccinctly stated that “in briefing after the court’s Opinion and Order, theparties essentially agreed that the Palucks’ evidence met the standard asdefined by the court.” In that connection, the special master quoted thegovernment’s interpretation of Paluck II as having “hamstrung the special masterfrom denying compensation under prong one of Althen.”On this second review, the government contends that the court in Paluck II“inappropriately relaxed the Vaccine Act’s requirements.” Respondent’s opinion(referring to the court’s observation in Paluck II), is “that Dr. Frye’s theoryis, while not scientifically certain, under active, continuing scientificinvestigation by a range of researchers, showing that it is sufficiently worthyand reliable to merit that extensive scientific injury.” The government’scriticism is misplaced. The Federal Circuit has repeatedly emphasized thatpreponderant proof of causation does not require scientific certainty, butrather a showing that the vaccine more likely than not caused the injury.“While this case involves . . . a sequence hitherto unproven in medicine, thepurpose of the Vaccine Act’s preponderance standard is to allow the finding ofcausation in a field bereft of complete and direct proof of how vaccines affectthe human body. A petitioner must provide a reputable medical or scientificexplanation that pertains specifically to the petitioner’s case, although theexplanation need only be ‘legally probable, not medically or scientificallycertain.’” “Requiring ‘epidemiologic studies . . . or general acceptance in thescientific or medical communities . . . impermissibly raises a claimant’s burdenunder the Vaccine Act.’” Even so, the preponderance standard for causation isnot to be confused with a standard requiring only “possible” or “plausible”causation.Mitochondrial disorders are only incompletely understood in biomedical science,although basic mechanisms are known. Those with normally functioningmitochondria have better antioxidant defenses that allow them to “convert . . .reactive oxygen species to harmless compounds.” This is because mitochondria areresponsible for the creation of the energy-carrying molecule, adenosinetriphosphate (“ATP”), which is required for the synthesis of the primaryantioxidant, glutathione. Contrastingly, defective mitochondria can have anopposite effect, themselves producing abnormally high amounts of reactive oxygenspecies, which can cause damage. Thus, people with mitochondrial defects aremore vulnerable to oxidative stress.Dr. Snodgrass did not disagree with the basic premises behind Dr. Frye’s theory,but he disagreed that there was evidence, i.e., published peer-reviewed studies,that normal vaccines given to humans cause oxidative stress. “I would say thatif you have a mitochondrial abnormality, your ability to recover from excessivereactive oxygen species or reactive nitrogen species may be less.” Vaccines canaffect children with mitochondrial disorders. Dr. Snodgrass stated that of hisabout twenty patients with a mitochondrial disorder, none of them have worsenedwith immunization, but he admitted that because mitochondrial disorders areheterogeneous, it is difficult to predict how the same stressor would affectdifferent people. On cross-examination, Dr. Snodgrass conceded that, in theory,Karl’s otitis media, erythema multiforme, and the vaccines administered inJanuary 2005 could have “all worked together and been a substantial factor inbringing about his neurodegeneration.” He maintained, however, that that thetheoretical postulate was not established in this case because Karl did not getworse in January and February after the immunizations. Nonetheless, whether Karlgot worse in January and February after the vaccinations does not relate to thelegal acceptability of Dr. Frye’s theory under Loving prong four, but insteadbears on Loving prongs five and six, i.e., the logical sequence of cause andeffect and a medically acceptable approximate temporal relationship.Contrary to the government’s reading of this court’s articulation of a standardfor Loving prong four (Althen prong one) in Paluck II, it is not solely becausea theory is under active scientific investigation that it is reputable, worthy,and reliable. The court instead was stating that the special master could notwholly discount animal studies showing oxidative stress resulting fromvaccinations plus ongoing, continuing scientific investigation into whetherhumans also can experience similar oxidative stress resulting from vaccinations.Nor could the special master discredit a peer-reviewed study that suggestedoxidative stress in humans resulted from receipt of the flu vaccine, solelybecause the researcher used a different biomarker than he did in a prior study.(Michael Phillips et al., Effect of Influenza Vaccination on Oxidative StressProducts in Breath, J. Breath Research, June 2010). The court was not relaxingthe standard for reliability, but rather was applying the pertinent andappropriate standard where research was underway testing reputable theories thatwere supported by basic knowledge.Loving Prong 5 (Althen Prong 2)—Whether there is a logical sequence of cause andeffect showing that the vaccination caused the significant aggravation:Accepting Dr. Frye’s theory of causation that vaccines can activate anoverwhelming immune response in children with mitochondrial defects and lead toneurodegeneration, the next inquiry is whether, in Karl’s particular case, thatprocess occurred. Similar to the level of proof required in establishing amedical theory, the sequence of cause and effect must be “logical and legallyprobable, not medically or scientifically certain.”Petitioners contend that the special master put aside expert testimony andcontemporaneous medical records in favor of drawing his own medical conclusionsfrom the evidence. Specifically, petitioners challenge his reading of thechiropractic records, Dr. McDonough’s referral to the neurologist in March 2005,and testimony regarding the various MRIs.First, the special master determined that Dr. Frye’s theory requires a linear,downward decline without any periodic improvements. Both the government and thespecial master cite this court’s opinion in Paluck II for the proposition thatthis court approved of the special master’s prior conclusion that “petitioners’medical theory predicted a steady, downward decline in health aftervaccination.” The court did not disturb the finding that Dr. Frye’s theory waspredicated on a downhill trajectory.” The citation provided by both therespondent and the special master misapprehends the court’s prior action. Thiscourt did not address the special master’s determination in Paluck I that Karl’sregression could only fit Dr. Frye’s theory if Karl experienced a “continuousdownward slope” of injury. The decision to require a linear, downward slope isunfounded in the testimony. The special master in Paluck I interpreted Dr.Frye’s phrase that “Karl’s progress looked like it was just a progressive hilldownward for about six months,” to mean “a continuous downward slope.” Thespecial master maintained this interpretation in Paluck IV (“the special masteragain concludes that Karl’s deterioration was non-linear”). Dr. Frye, however,never suggested that a child experiencing neurodegeneration could not haveperiods of remission or improvement. His use of the word “progressive” does notmean a continuous linear decline. As a general matter, when used in describing adisease, progressive means “increasing in extent or severity.” Merriam-Webster’sTenth Collegiate Dictionary 932 (1998); see also New Oxford American Dictionary1396 (2010) (“(of a disease or ailment) increasing in severity or extent”). Thisstandard medical usage allows for a non-linear decline. To fall within Dr.Frye’s theory and the applicable medical literature, it is sufficient if Karl’smedical records show a decline in condition over time, notwithstanding periodsof remission or modest improvement.Second, the special master considered the chiropractic records and statements byhis treating physicians regarding Karl’s decline. In the remand, the courtordered the special master to reconsider the importance of these particularpieces of the record, in conjunction with other pieces of the record.Accordingly, this court will consider the entire record in determining whetherpetitioners have met their burden of proof under Loving prong five.Karl had a fever on January 21, 2005, two days after the vaccinations thatcontinued to be evident on January 28, 2005, nine days after the vaccinations.Daycare notes from the intervening days consistently show that Karl was tired,irritable, and not eating well. According to Dr. Frye, these are all systemicsigns of being sick, that is, signs of immune activation. Dr. Frye testifiedthat a fever any time within two weeks of a vaccination could reasonably beattributed to the vaccination.Dr. Snodgrass disagreed that Karl’s fever could have been caused by thevaccines. He explained that the MMR and varicella vaccines do cause fever insome children, but fever would not usually appear until the seventh or eighthday. On cross-examination, petitioners’ counsel asked Dr. Snodgrass whether hewas familiar with the packaging insert accompanying the Prevnar vaccine, whichstates that “15% of children who receive PCV-7 report fever of greater than 38degrees centigrade within two days following vaccination.” He responded that hewas, but that the packaging insert does not truly prove causation as ascientific matter. He referred to a study about the MMR vaccine, one of theother vaccines Karl received, which took 500 sets of identical twins, giving onetwin the vaccine and the other a placebo. In his view, this type of study betterproves that a vaccine causes fevers. In short, Dr. Snodgrass again looked formedical certainty where none is required. It is sufficiently logical that Karlhad a reaction to the Prevnar vaccine, manifesting as a fever within two days.He additionally did not explain why the fever on day nine could not beattributed to the vaccinations, stating only that Karl’s fevers could have beendue to an outbreak of his erythema multiforme, which reappeared on January 31st.He testified further that fever is very common among children in daycare and maynot specifically indicate oxidative stress. Similarly, in his view, whileirritability might be an indication of something serious, it is not specific.Several points of common ground exist. A fever is usually a symptom of immuneactivation; that much was acknowledged by both experts. And, the daycare recordscontemporaneously documented that Karl had lethargy and irritability along withthe fever in the days following the vaccinations. While fever, lethargy, andirritability might possibly have been caused by something besides thevaccinations, sufficient evidence exists to indicate that they were in factcaused by the vaccinations. That at least one of the five vaccines that Karlreceived, or a combination thereof, caused him to have a fever due to immuneactivation is logical and legally probable. A prima facie case to that effectwas established. Accordingly, the burden shifted to the respondent to showanother, alternative, cause. That shifted burden was not met, nor did therespondent attempt to meet it.Dr. Frye’s theory postulates that immune activation can cause the development ofpotentially toxic reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species that, ifleft unchecked by the body’s antioxidants, can lead to oxidative stress and celldeath. Thus, one would look for evidence of whether Karl experienced cell death.In this case, petitioners contend that Karl’s neurodegeneration is evidence ofbrain cell death.Karl’s health deteriorated in February 2005. The chiropractor noted he wasspastic on February 11, 2005. As detailed previously, Karl’s later chiropracticrecords reflect varying levels of rigidity and tone. Regardless of whether Karlhad days in the subsequent weeks where he was more or less rigid, Karl neverappeared to improve above his initial assessment, and he was still reported asspastic in April by the pediatric neurologist, Dr. Kriengkrairut. Uponquestioning by the special master regarding the chiropractic treatment Karlreceived, Dr. Frye testified that spasticity can be improved by “pulling themuscles and loosening the muscles so that they have full range of motion.” Thisdoes not solve the upper neuron problem causing the spasticity, but it canmitigate the symptoms. “By manipulating the muscles you’re resetting thefeedback mechanism that sets the tone of the muscles. . . . When neurons fromthe brain aren’t there the feedback loop becomes or is set too high and themuscles have too much tone. . . . By using physical therapy we start to stretchout the muscles and that can try to reset the feedback loop that we have in themuscles.” That Karl’s tone fluctuated while he was seeing the chiropractor andthe K.I.D.S. therapists would be expected.In asserting that Karl did not decline between January and February, Dr.Snodgrass stated that “the single most important thing is that we had a lot ofcalls and doctor visits in November and December. If Karl had a precipitousdecline in January and February, these parents who seem to be responsibleparents would have been calling and visiting the doctor, that’s number one.” Dr.Snodgrass’s inference and the special master’s reliance on it are not supportedby substantial evidence. Karl’s parents actually were taking him frequently to amedical provider, i.e., the chiropractor. They took him to the chiropractor ninetimes in a three week period in February alone, apparently believing that Karlhad a pinched nerve preventing his development. Dr. Snodgrass can disagree withtheir course of action, implicitly being critical of treatment by a chiropractorrather than a physician, but his testimony implying that the Palucks thoughtmedical treatment unnecessary for Karl is not supported by evidence.Contrary to the special master’s conclusion, the fact that Karl had few visiblesigns of injury other than fever immediately following the vaccinations is inkeeping with Dr. Frye’s theory (“part of the Althen prong 2 analysis mayconsider whether the expert’s ‘theory accounted for the vaccinee’s injury’”(quoting Hibbard v. Secretary of Health & Human Servs.). Dr. Frye testified thatchanges at the cellular level would occur first and would take time to becomeclinically visible. That the MRI from April 2005 was initially interpreted asnormal and only later reinterpreted as abnormal upon re-examination in July 2005suggests that the changes were indeed small at first, but they had beeninitiated. Because the changes were likely occurring at a cellular level atfirst, Karl was probably worsening in February and March even if it was notlinearly progressive. The rate at which that process would occur would depend onthe type and severity of the person’s mitochondrial disorder. As an example, Dr.Frye pointed to the Hannah Poling case study (referring to R. Ex. 21q, Jon S.Poling, Richard E. Frye, John Shoffner & Andrew W. Zimmerman, DevelopmentalRegression and Mitochondrial Dysfunction in a Child with Autism, 21 J. ChildNeurology 170 (2006)). Hannah was a developmentally normal nineteen-month-oldgirl who, within 48 hours of receiving several vaccinations, developed a highfever, inconsolable crying, irritability, and lethargy, and refused to walk.Four days later, she could not walk up stairs. She had a low-grade intermittentfever during the next twelve days. She continued to decline over the next threemonths, developing autistic behaviors and losing all speech. Previously she hadbeen able to say at least twenty words. It was later discovered that she had amitochondrial disorder. In 2006, at the time of publication of the case study,Hannah was six and had greatly improved in her language functions andsociability, although she still exhibited mild autism. This case study did notprove causation with any medical certainty, but it hypothesized that “ifmitochondrial dysfunction is present at the time of infections and immunizationsin young children, the added oxidative stresses from immune activation oncellular energy metabolism are likely to be especially critical for the centralnervous system, which is highly dependent on mitochondrial function.” Dr. Fryepointed to similarities between Hannah and Karl. First, they have similarmitochondrial abnormalities. Both received MMR and varicella vaccinations,developed a fever around 48 hours later, became noticeably irritable, andeventually experienced neurological regression. Hannah’s decline occurred morequickly in some ways, but her regression, like Karl’s, appeared to continue overa number of months. Her appetite remained poor for six months, but she begansaying a few words again about four months after the vaccinations. In contrast,Karl has experienced complete neurodegeneration and is not expected to improve.Dr. Frye opined that Karl’s pre-existing chronic immune activation may haveimpaired his ability to recover as Hannah did.Dr. Frye also pointed to a peer-reviewed article by Dr. John Shoffner andothers. The researchers found in a retrospective study that autistic regressionoccurred twice as often in a subset of autistic children with mitochondrialdisorders after a fever than it did in the general population of autisticchildren (referring to John Shoffner et al., Fever Plus Mitochondrial DiseasesCould Be Risk Factors for Autistic Regression, 25 J. Child Neurology, 2010).Approximately 25% of children with autism will experience autistic regressionbefore the age of three. The researchers defined autistic regression to mean “aloss of developmental skills that included speech, receptive skills, eyecontact, and social interests in individuals.” A relationship between fever andregression was defined as “regression beginning within two weeks of a febrileepisode without the suggestion of infection, meningitis, or encephalitis.” Inthe study, 60.7% of the children experienced autistic regression, which was a“statistically significant increase” over the estimated 25% reported in thegeneral autistic population. A high percentage, 70.6%, of those who experiencedautistic regression did so following a fever. In 33.3% of those who experiencedautistic regression following fever, the fever was associated with response to avaccination. The specific vaccine schedule leading to fever in the subjects wasnot available. The study acknowledged that “due to the complexities inmitochondrial disease pathogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation enzyme defects arehighly variable even among groups of individuals who harbor identicalmutations.” According to Dr. Frye, this study, combined with the Poling casestudy, strongly suggested that vaccinations in children with mitochondrialdiseases can cause fever followed by regressive loss of skills.Dr. Snodgrass cited a number of differences between Karl’s case and Hannah’scase. First, Hannah’s clinical worsening was much more dramatic than Karl’s. Sherefused to walk within 48 hours of receiving the vaccination, a more notableloss of skill than anything Karl experienced. Second, there is no evidence thatKarl suffered encephalopathy, and it was agreed that Hannah did. “In Karl’s casewe really don’t see that. In this retrospective study, researchers examined thecharts of 28 children who they knew to have autism and mitochondrial disease.They used the charts to determine whether the children experienced feverfollowed by autistic regression.(Phosphorylation is defined as “the metabolic process of introducing a phosphategroup into an organic molecule.” Oxidative phosphorylation, specifically, isdefined as “the formation of high energy phosphate bonds by phosphorylation ofADP to ATP coupled to the transfer of electrons from reduced coenzymes (NADH orFADH2) to molecular oxygen via the electron transport chain. . . . Threemolecules of ATP per NADH and two per FADH2 are produced as a result of a protongradient created across the mitochondrial inner membrane by the electrontransport chain.” Thus, “oxidative phosphorylation enzyme defects” can beunderstood as defects in ATP production.)“Yes, he was irritable. Irritability is not encephalopathy. He was not kept homefrom day care, he was not taken to the doctor. So we do not see evidence thatKarl had encephalopathy.” As for Dr. Frye’s reliance on the Shoffner paper, Dr.Snodgrass criticized its simplicity, questioning how researchers could haveknown that any particular fever that a child experienced caused the regression.Dr. Snodgrass’s critiques might provide valid points of departure for furtherscientific study in this area of medicine, but they do not negate theevidentiary value provided by the Poling case report or the Shoffner study. Dr.Snodgrass and Dr. Frye agreed that case studies do not prove causation. But Dr.Frye correctly pointed out that “that’s where science starts is with casereports.” Dr. Frye testified that this particular area of medicine is “emergingand evolving.” Mitochondrial diseases themselves are difficult to identify, andtheir courses of progression are not easily predicted. The effect of fevers onthose with a mitochondrial disorder is even more difficult to assess. The Polingcase report and the Shoffner study nonetheless provide indicia for this case.In considering the opinions of Karl’s treating doctors as to the cause of Karl’sdecline, the special master considered the chiropractor’s opinion, Dr.McDonough’s referral to the neurologist, and the MRI reports. First, asdiscussed supra, the special master’s statement that the chiropractor did notbelieve Karl had an adverse reaction to a vaccine simply misread a handwrittenentry in the medical record. Rather, the chiropractor believed it was possibleKarl had an adverse reaction to a vaccine. Second, in reviewing Dr. McDonough’sreferral to Dr. Kriengkrairut, the pediatric neurologist, the special masterinquired into Dr. McDonough’s motivations. Aside from desiring more completetesting of Karl’s neurological system, the special master opined that Dr.McDonough made the referral because he was “frustrated the Palucks were notfollowing his recommendations for physical therapy, occupational therapy, and astimulation program for Karl.” The special master criticized petitioners for notraising the argument that Dr. McDonough made the referral because he believedKarl was getting worse. The special master apparently ignored Dr. Frye’stestimony on direct examination that the referral is “the first indication thatwe have that the pediatrician is now concerned to such a level that Karl needsto see a neurologist.” There simply is no evidentiary support for the specialmaster’s hypothesis that Dr. McDonough made the referral out of frustration withthe Palucks. Third, regarding the MRI reports, the special master concluded that“the Palucks have not established that Dr. Frye’s conclusion that Karl’s corpuscallosum started to thin after the vaccination is more likely than Dr.Snodgrass’s conclusion that the corpus callosum could have been thin before thevaccination.” Accordingly, the special master used his finding that Karl hadproblems in his central nervous system before the vaccination as the tie breakerto determine that the thinning occurred before the vaccinations. This court hasoverturned the special master’s finding that Karl definitively had neurologicalproblems before. Evidence of causation need not be proven to a medicalcertainty; it need only be “logical and legally probable.” The subtlety of thethinning in April, and the clarity of the thinning in July, suggests that thethinning had only begun in April or shortly before then. Petitioners havepresented sufficient evidence to show that Karl regressed after receiving thevaccines, and they have provided medical records and medical literature toestablish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Karl’s pre-existing medicalproblems were significantly aggravated by the vaccinations. Karl had a fevershortly after receiving the vaccinations, was described as “spastic” for thefirst time on February 11, was referred to a neurologist in March, and by Aprilhad a negative neurological evaluation and an abnormal MRI. Petitionerspresented a peer-reviewed study showing increased regression in children withmitochondrial diseases following fever. They also presented a case studydemonstrating that a young girl with an underlying mitochondrial disorder lostpreviously developed skills over the course of months after experiencing a feverwithin 48 hours of vaccinations. Petitioners have carried their burden of proofon this prong.Loving Prong 6 (Althen Prong 3)—Whether a medically acceptable proximatetemporal relationship exists between the vaccination and the significantaggravation: The final prong of the Loving analysis requires the court todetermine the time frame for which it is medically acceptable to infer causationand whether the onset of the claimant’s injury occurred within that time frame.Petitioners contend that the special master ignored the record in concludingthat Karl exhibited no evidence of neurodegeneration within an acceptable timeframe. Specifically, they argue that he ignored Dr. Frye’s testimony thatevidence of neurodegeneration occurred within a medically acceptable time.Respondent maintains that the special master carefully considered all of theevidence and found respondent’s expert more persuasive than petitioners’, anapproach and result that is well within the special master’s role as a finder offact.In Paluck IV, the special master found that the medically acceptable temporalinterval is three weeks. He based this determination largely on an article byDr. Edmonds entitled The Otolaryngological Manifestations of MitochondrialDisease and the Risk of Neurodegeneration with Infection. The Edmonds articlecollected information about 40 patients with mitochondrial diseases. Of theseforty patients, eighteen experienced neurodegenerative events. Intercurrentinfection was recognized as a precipitant of neurodegenerative events inthirteen of these eighteen patients. The article graphically depicts the timingof the onset of neurodegenerative events after the onset of infection as ranginguntil nineteen days after infection. While the Edmonds article looked forneurodegeneration after infection, not reaction to a vaccination, both expertsagree that it provides a reasonable guideline for neurodegeneration followingimmune activation.The special master also relied on the Shoffner study, which found that arelationship between fever and autistic regression existed, but this reliance issomewhat misplaced because the Shoffner study defined a relationship betweenfever and regression as occurring within two weeks, excluding later sequela.Therefore, by definition, the study could not have found a relationship betweenfever and regression more attenuated than two weeks. Thus, while the Shoffnerarticle supports a statement that autistic regression following fever can occurwithin two weeks, it cannot equally support a statement that autistic regressionfollowing fever must occur within two weeks. The special master also relied onthe Hannah Poling case study, noting that she had a fever within 48 hours, couldnot climb the stairs within seven days, and developed a rash within two weeks.The Edmonds article is the most enlightening regarding an acceptable medicaltime frame for the onset of neurodegenerative events following immune systemactivation. The Edmonds article, however, acknowledges the severe dearth ofmedical literature in this area: “Because of the relative novelty ofmitochondrial disorders, no reports in the literature have quantified the riskfor neurodegenerative events triggered by infections in patients withmitochondrial disease.” Dr. Bob Naviaux, Co-Director of the Mitochondrial andMetabolic Disease Center at the University of California, San Diego, expressed asimilar sentiment in commenting on the Shoffner study—“Commentary on JohnShoffner et al., Fever Plus Mitochondrial Disease Could Be Risk Factors forAutistic Regression, published in J. Child Neurology (2010).” According to Dr.Naviaux, the temporal relationship between the triggering event andneurodegeneration is unsettled. There appears to be a more rapid “flare”response and a more delayed “fade” response. He credited the Shoffner study withproviding a touchstone for new questions, such as “which kinds of mitochondrialdefects lead to rapid, high-grade fevers in response to infection orvaccination” and “which defects lead to a failed fever response, or to alow-grade fever, or to a reduced immune response to vaccination?”Dr. Frye accepted the premises of these articles, testifying that the temporallink requires much further study. He did testify, however, that an adversereaction to a vaccine is likely to appear within a week of receiving it. Hefurther stated that the adverse reaction can peak several days after thevaccination, and then “lead to . . . metabolic decompensation, which is anongoing process . . . that will continue until it burns itself out,” if it isnot interrupted. Dr. Snodgrass and Dr. Frye disagree whether Karl’s first fever,within two days of the vaccination, could have been caused by the vaccination,but they apparently agree that any fever around one week following Karl’svaccinations could have been caused by the vaccines. Thus, at least Karl’scontinuing fever is safely within any type of medically accepted time frame forKarl’s injury.The special master appeared determined to establish a definitive bound forneurodegeneration, but the court disagrees that such a bound can be sharplydelineated in this specific area. Neither the medical literature nor the experttestimony stated with any certainty when neurodegeneration can be expected tobegin in all cases. Dr. Snodgrass based his testimony that a change would haveto begin “within a few weeks” on the Edmonds article. As previously discussed,the Edmonds article is the first of its kind and cannot be read to suggest adefinitive temporal interval for neurodegeneration in response to all triggeringevents for any type of mitochondrial disorder. In response to questioning fromthe special master, Dr. Frye testified that the timing for neurodegenerativechanges to appear clinically in a child would depend on the severity and type ofmitochondrial disorder. This is consistent with Dr. Naviaux’s commentary on theShoffner study.In this instance, Dr. Frye pinpointed the chiropractor’s notation that Karl was“spastic” on February 11, 2005 as an identifiable neurodegenerative event. ToDr. Frye, the neurodegenerative process must have begun by then. This eventoccurred within the general time frame suggested by both the special master andDr. Snodgrass. (“The change should come within a few weeks.”) Starting with thischiropractic notation, the record shows Karl experienced a general decline. Hischiropractic assessment remained the same throughout all of February, even ifthe subjective descriptions of Karl’s day-to-day behaviors varied. Karl waslosing language throughout this period, and by late March, Dr. McDonough saw aneed for him to be evaluated by a neurologist.In conclusion, setting a hard and fast time frame in an uncertain areaundergoing sustained scientific investigation is contrary to the preceptsgoverning the Vaccine Act. Karl had a fever within 48 hours of the vaccinations,accompanied by a week of lethargy, irritability, more fever, and disruptedsleeping and eating cycles. This prompt reaction is consistent with an adverseimmune reaction to the vaccines. An observation of spasticity followed within atime that all agreed would have been appropriate for a neurodegenerative event.Karl experienced total decline within six months, and he did not continue todevelop in any way after the vaccinations. These facts combined with his febrilereaction to the vaccine show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Karl’sexisting medical setbacks were significantly aggravated by his receipt of thevaccinations within a medically acceptable time.CONCLUSIONFor the reasons stated, the Palucks’ motion for review is GRANTED, the specialmaster’s decision of May 10, 2013 denying compensation is VACATED, and the courtacts in accord with 42 U.S.C. § 300aa-12(e)(2)(B) to find that petitioners havesatisfied each of the six Loving elements and are entitled to compensation underthe Act.

Secretary of Health and Human Services, RespondentSummary: In this decision, the special master accepts a settlement stipulationbetween the parties in which compensation is awarded for Kleine-Levin Syndrome.Compensated Vaccine Injury: Kleine-Levin Syndrome (KLS)Kleine-Levin syndrome is a rare disorder that primarily affects adolescent males(approximately 70 percent of those with Kleine-Levin syndrome are male). It ischaracterized by recurring but reversible periods of excessive sleep (up to 20hours per day). Symptoms occur as “episodes,” typically lasting a few days to afew weeks. Episode onset is often abrupt, and may be associated with flu-likesymptoms. Excessive food intake, irritability, childishness, disorientation,hallucinations, and an abnormally uninhibited sex drive may be observed duringepisodes. Mood can be depressed as a consequence, but not a cause, of thedisorder. Affected individuals are completely normal between episodes, althoughthey may not be able to remember afterwards everything that happened during theepisode. It may be weeks or more before symptoms reappear. Symptoms may berelated to malfunction of the hypothalamus and thalamus, parts of the brain thatgovern appetite and sleep.There is no definitive treatment for Kleine-Levin syndrome and watchful waitingat home, rather than pharmacotherapy, is most often advised. Stimulant pills,including amphetamines, methylphenidate, and modafinil, are used to treatsleepiness but may increase irritability and will not improve cognitiveabnormalities. Because of similarities between Kleine-Levin syndrome and certainmood disorders, lithium and carbamazepine may be prescribed and, in some cases,have been shown to prevent further episodes. This disorder should bedifferentiated from cyclic re-occurrence of sleepiness during the premenstrualperiod in teen-aged girls, which may be controlled with birth control pills. Italso should be differentiated from encephalopathy, recurrent depression, orpsychosis.Episodes eventually decrease in frequency and intensity over the course of eightto 12 years.Damages decision based on stipulation; Kleine-Levin Syndrome; Varicella vaccineCase No: 10-526VDate Filed: November 25, 2013William Blatt, Petitioner v.

Secretary of Health and Human Services,RespondentSummary: In the next four (4) decisions, the Special Master accepts settlementstipulations between the parties in which compensation is awarded for acutedisseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). Compensation for ADEM is fairly commonwithin the unreported case settlements.Compensated Vaccine Injury: Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM)Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is characterized by a brief butwidespread attack of inflammation in the brain and spinal cord that damagesmyelin—the protective covering of nerve fibers. ADEM often follows viral orbacterial infections, or less often, vaccination for measles, mumps, or rubella.The symptoms of ADEM appear rapidly, beginning with encephalitis-like symptomssuch as fever, fatigue, headache, nausea and vomiting, and in the most severecases, seizures and coma.ADEM typically damages white matter (brain tissue that takes its name from thewhite color of myelin), leading to neurological symptoms such as visual loss(due to inflammation of the optic nerve) in one or both eyes, weakness even tothe point of paralysis, and difficulty coordinating voluntary muscle movements(such as those used in walking). ADEM is sometimes misdiagnosed as a severefirst attack of multiple sclerosis (MS), since the symptoms and the appearanceof the white matter injury on brain imaging may be similar. However, ADEM hasseveral features which differentiate it from MS. First, unlike MS patients,persons with ADEM will have rapid onset of fever, a history of recent infectionor immunization, and some degree of impairment of consciousness, perhaps evencoma; these features are not typically seen in MS.Children are more likely than adults to have ADEM, whereas MS is a rarediagnosis in children. In addition, ADEM usually consists of a single episode orattack of widespread myelin damage, while MS features many attacks over thecourse of time. Doctors will often use imaging techniques, such as MRI (magneticresonance imaging), to search for old and new lesions (areas of damage) on thebrain. The presence of older brain lesions on MRI suggest that the condition maybe MS rather than ADEM, since MS can cause brain lesions before symptoms becomeobvious. In rare situations, a brain biopsy may be necessary to differentiatebetween ADEM and some other diseases that involve inflammation and damage tomyelin.Treatment for ADEM is targeted at suppressing inflammation in the brain usinganti-inflammatory drugs. Most individuals respond to several days of intravenouscorticosteroids such as methylprednisolone, followed by oral corticosteroidtreatment.When corticosteroids fail to work, plasmapheresis or intravenous immunoglobulintherapy are possible secondary treatment options that are reported to help insome severe cases. Additional treatment is symptomatic and supportive.Corticosteroid therapy typically helps hasten recovery from most ADEM symptoms.The long-term prognosis for individuals with ADEM is generally favorable. Formost individuals, recovery begins within days, and within six months themajority of ADEM patients will have total or near total recoveries. Others mayhave mild to moderate lifelong impairment ranging from cognitive difficulties,weakness, loss of vision, or numbness. Severe cases of ADEM can be fatal butthis is a very rare occurrence. ADEM can recur, usually within months of theinitial diagnosis, and is treated by restarting corticosteroids. A smallfraction of individuals who are initially diagnosed as having ADEM can go on todevelop MS, but there is currently no method or known risk factors to predictwhom those individuals will be.Joint Stipulation on Damages; Trivalent Influenza (Flu) Vaccine; AcuteDisseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM).Case No: 10-245VDate Filed: April 11, 2013Julie A.

Secretary of Health and Human Services, RespondentSummary: In the next four cases, Special Masters accept settlements between theparties and award compensation for transverse myelitis.Compensated Vaccine Injury: Transverse MyelitisAccording to the National Institutes of Neurological Disorder and Stroke,transverse myelitis is a neurological disorder caused by inflammation acrossboth sides of one level, or segment, of the spinal cord. The term myelitisrefers to inflammation of the spinal cord; transverse simply describes theposition of the inflammation, that is, across the width of the spinal cord.Attacks of inflammation can damage or destroy myelin, the fatty insulatingsubstance that covers nerve cell fibers. This damage causes nervous system scarsthat interrupt communications between the nerves in the spinal cord and the restof the body.Symptoms of transverse myelitis include a loss of spinal cord function overseveral hours to several weeks. What usually begins as a sudden onset of lowerback pain, muscle weakness, or abnormal sensations in the toes and feet canrapidly progress to more severe symptoms, including paralysis, urinaryretention, and loss of bowel control. Although some patients recover fromtransverse myelitis with minor or no residual problems, others suffer permanentimpairments that affect their ability to perform ordinary tasks of daily living.Most patients will have only one episode of transverse myelitis; a smallpercentage may have a recurrence.The segment of the spinal cord at which the damage occurs determines which partsof the body are affected. Nerves in the cervical (neck) region control signalsto the neck, arms, hands, and muscles of breathing (the diaphragm). Nerves inthe thoracic (upper back) region relay signals to the torso and some parts ofthe arms. Nerves at the lumbar (mid-back) level control signals to the hips andlegs. Finally, sacral nerves, located within the lowest segment of the spinalcord, relay signals to the groin, toes, and some parts of the legs. Damage atone segment will affect function at that segment and segments below it. Inpatients with transverse myelitis, demyelination usually occurs at the thoraciclevel, causing problems with leg movement and bowel and bladder control, whichrequire signals from the lower segments of the spinal cord.Transverse myelitis occurs in adults and children, in both genders, and in allraces. No familial predisposition is apparent. A peak in incidence rates (thenumber of new cases per year) appears to occur between 10 and 19 years and 30and 39 years. Although only a few studies have examined incidence rates, it isestimated that about 1,400 new cases of transverse myelitis are diagnosed eachyear in the United States, and approximately 33,000 Americans have some type ofdisability resulting from the disorder.Researchers are uncertain of the exact causes of transverse myelitis. Theinflammation that causes such extensive damage to nerve fibers of the spinalcord may result from viral infections or abnormal immune reactions. Transversemyelitis also may occur as a complication of syphilis, measles, Lyme disease,and some vaccinations, including those for chickenpox and rabies. Cases in whicha cause cannot be identified are called idiopathic.Transverse myelitis often develops following viral infections. Infectious agentssuspected of causing transverse myelitis include varicella zoster (the virusthat causes chickenpox and shingles), herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus,Epstein-Barr, influenza, echovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),hepatitis A, and rubella. Bacterial skin infections, middle-ear infections(otitis media), and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (bacterial pneumonia) have also beenassociated with the condition.In post-infectious cases of transverse myelitis, immune system mechanisms,rather than active viral or bacterial infections, appear to play an importantrole in causing damage to spinal nerves. Although researchers have not yetidentified the precise mechanisms of spinal cord injury in these cases,stimulation of the immune system in response to infection indicates that anautoimmune reaction may be responsible. In autoimmune diseases, the immunesystem, which normally protects the body from foreign organisms, mistakenlyattacks the body’s own tissue, causing inflammation and, in some cases, damageto myelin within the spinal cord.Because some affected individuals also have autoimmune diseases such as systemiclupus erythematosus, Sjogren’s syndrome, and sarcoidosis, some scientistssuggest that transverse myelitis may also be an autoimmune disorder. Inaddition, some cancers may trigger an abnormal immune response that may lead totransverse myelitis.In some people, transverse myeltis represents the first symptom of an underlyingdemyelinating disease of the central nervous system such as multiple sclerosis(MS) or neuromyelitis optica (NMO). A form of transverse myelitis known as“partial” myelitis—because it affects only a portion of the cross-sectional areaof the spinal cord—is more characteristic of MS. Neuromyelitis optica typicallycauses both transverse myelitis and optic neuritis (inflammation of the opticnerve that results in visual loss), but not necessarily at the same time. Allpatients with transverse myelitis should be evaluated for MS or NMO becausepatients with these diagnoses may require different treatments, especiallytherapies to prevent future attacks.Transverse myelitis may be either acute (developing over hours to several days)or subacute (usually developing over 1 to 4 weeks). Initial symptoms usuallyinclude localized lower back pain, sudden paresthesias (abnormal sensations suchas burning, tickling, pricking, or tingling) in the legs, sensory loss, andparaparesis (partial paralysis of the legs). Paraparesis may progress toparaplegia (paralysis of the legs and lower part of the trunk). Urinary bladderand bowel dysfunction is common. Many patients also report experiencing musclespasms, a general feeling of discomfort, headache, fever, and loss of appetite.Depending on which segment of the spinal cord is involved, some patients mayexperience respiratory problems as well.From this wide array of symptoms, four classic features of transverse myelitisemerge: (1) weakness of the legs and arms, (2) pain, (3) sensory alteration, and(4) bowel and bladder dysfunction. Most patients will experience weakness ofvarying degrees in their legs; some also experience it in their arms. Initially,people with transverse myelitis may notice that they are stumbling or draggingone foot or that their legs seem heavier than normal. Coordination of hand andarm movements, as well as arm and hand strength, may also be compromised.Progression of the disease leads to full paralysis of the legs, requiring thepatient to use a wheelchair.Pain is the primary presenting symptom of transverse myelitis in approximatelyone-third to one-half of all patients. The pain may be localized in the lowerback or may consist of sharp, shooting sensations that radiate down the legs orarms or around the torso.Patients who experience sensory disturbances often use terms such as numbness,tingling, coldness, or burning to describe their symptoms. Up to 80 percent ofthose with transverse myelitis report areas of heightened sensitivity to touch,such that clothing or a light touch with a finger causes significant discomfortor pain (a condition called allodynia). Many also experience heightenedsensitivity to changes in temperature or to extreme heat or cold.Bladder and bowel problems may involve increased frequency of the urge tourinate or have bowel movements, incontinence, difficulty voiding, the sensationof incomplete evacuation, and constipation. Over the course of the disease, themajority of people with transverse myelitis will experience one or several ofthese symptoms.Stipulation; Inactivated Polio Virus Vaccine; Diphtheria, Tetanus, and AcelluarPertussis Vaccine; Transverse Myelitis.Case No: 11-0047VDate Filed: August 26, 2013Yanping Xu, Natural Father, and Qiuyue Yu, Natural Mother, of Kyle Xu, a minor,Petitioners v.

The facial nerve—also called the 7th cranialnerve—travels through a narrow, bony canal (called the Fallopian canal) in theskull, beneath the ear, to the muscles on each side of the face. For most of itsjourney, the nerve is encased in this bony shell.Each facial nerve directs the muscles on one side of the face, including thosethat control eye blinking and closing, and facial expressions such as smilingand frowning. Additionally, the facial nerve carries nerve impulses to thelacrimal or tear glands, the saliva glands, and the muscles of a small bone inthe middle of the ear called the stapes. The facial nerve also transmits tastesensations from the tongue.When Bell’s palsy occurs, the function of the facial nerve is disrupted, causingan interruption in the messages the brain sends to the facial muscles. Thisinterruption results in facial weakness or paralysis.Bell’s palsy is named for Sir Charles Bell, a 19th-century Scottish surgeon whowas the first to describe the condition. The disorder, which is not related tostroke, is the most common cause of facial paralysis. Generally, Bell’s palsyaffects only one of the paired facial nerves and one side of the face; however,in rare cases, it can affect both sides.Because the facial nerve has so many functions and is so complex, damage to thenerve or a disruption in its function can lead to many problems. Symptoms ofBell’s palsy can vary from person to person and range in severity from mildweakness to total paralysis. These symptoms may include twitching, weakness, orparalysis on one or rarely both sides of the face. Other symptoms may includedrooping of the eyelid and corner of the mouth, drooling, dryness of the eye ormouth, impairment of taste, and excessive tearing in one eye. Most often thesesymptoms, which usually begin suddenly and reach their peak within 48 hours,lead to significant facial distortion.Other symptoms may include pain or discomfort around the jaw and behind the ear,ringing in one or both ears, headache, loss of taste, hypersensitivity to soundon the affected side, impaired speech, dizziness, and difficulty eating ordrinking.Bell’s palsy occurs when the nerve that controls the facial muscles is swollen,inflamed, or compressed, resulting in facial weakness or paralysis. Exactly whatcauses this damage, however, is unknown.Most scientists believe that a viral infection such as viral meningitis or thecommon cold sore virus—herpes simplex—causes the disorder. They believe that thefacial nerve swells and becomes inflamed in reaction to the infection, causingpressure within the Fallopian canal and leading to ischemia (the restriction ofblood and oxygen to the nerve cells). In some mild cases (where recovery israpid), there is damage only to the myelin sheath of the nerve. The myelinsheath is the fatty covering—which acts as an insulator—on nerve fibers in thebrain.The disorder has also been associated with influenza or a flu-like illness,headaches, chronic middle ear infection, high blood pressure, diabetes,sarcoidosis, tumors, Lyme disease, and trauma such as skull fracture or facialinjury.Stipulation; meningococcal vaccine; Bell’s palsy; joint stiffness; myalgia;sensory neuropathy; retinal vasculitis.Case No: 12-411VDate Filed: May 9, 2013Erica Hill, Natural Mother and Guardian for E.J., a minor, Petitioner v.Secretary of Health and Human Services, RespondentUNPUBLISHED DECISIONSpecial Master ZaneOn May 8, 2013, the parties in the above-captioned case filed a Stipulationmemorializing their agreement as to the appropriate amount of compensation inthis case.

It happens whensustained pressure is placed on a nerve. The feeling quickly goes away once thepressure is relieved.Chronic paresthesia is often a symptom of an underlying neurological disease ortraumatic nerve damage. Paresthesia can be caused by disorders affecting thecentral nervous system, such as stroke and transient ischemic attacks(mini-strokes), multiple sclerosis, transverse myelitis, and encephalitis. Atumor or vascular lesion pressed up against the brain or spinal cord can alsocause paresthesia. Nerve entrapment syndromes, such as carpal tunnel syndrome,can damage peripheral nerves and cause paresthesia accompanied by pain.Diagnostic evaluation is based on determining the underlying condition causingthe paresthetic sensations. An individual’s medical history, physicalexamination, and laboratory tests are essential for the diagnosis. Physiciansmay order additional tests depending on the suspected cause of the paresthesia.Damages decision based on stipulation; Hepatitis B vaccine; focal lipodystrophy;paresthesiasCase No: 12-166VDate Filed: November 8, 2013Regan M.

We see autismrepresented in the media as a puzzle piece—a mystery, an enigma. We hear aboutresearch focused on finding “the autism gene.” Yet the genetic research hasyielded little progress.And, while we hear about autism almost daily in the media, we are all reassuredthat autism is just believed to be more common because clinicians are better atdiagnosing it now than they were in the past.All of this thinking is flawed.Children and young adults with autism are more common today than they were inthe past because more individuals are suffering brain injuries than in the past.How much of the increase in autism is due to vaccine injury is not known. Thatquestion (and answer) is beyond the scope of this book. However, as the readerwill soon realize, vaccine injury is one route—by no means the only route—tothis behavioral disorder.Autism is not defined in the medical literature as a disease. It is described bysome in medicine as an indication of encephalopathy, a long acknowledged vaccineinjury outcome.Autism is defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,the DSM, as a behavioral disorder. In other words, if you have the behaviordeficits described in the DSM—deficits in social-emotional reciprocity, deficitsin nonverbal communicative behaviors, or deficits in developing, maintaining,and understanding relationships—it is quite possible that you are on the road toan autism diagnosis. If a person also exhibits “restricted, repetitive patternsof behavior, interests, or activities . . . stereotyped or repetitive motormovements, an insistence on sameness, inflexible adherence to routines, orritualized patterns,” a clinician is more likely to impart an autism diagnosis.As the following publicly available case documents will show, the behavioraldiagnosis of autism has long been known to occur in the presence of vaccineinjuries that result in encephalopathy. While this claim is controversial, thecases speak for themselves.Kienan Freeman, by his Mother, Rebekah Smothers, Petitioner v. Secretary ofHealth and Human Services, RespondentSummary: In this MMR injury case, the special master finds that the child’sseizure disorder and developmental delay (“retardation”) likely were the resultof his MMR vaccination. In a footnote it is reported that the child alsodeveloped an autism spectrum disorder.Case No: 01-390VDate Filed: September 25, 2003Kienan Freeman, by his Mother, Rebekah Smothers, Petitioner v. Secretary ofHealth and Human Services, RespondentHastings, Special MasterThis is an action in which the petitioner seeks an award under the NationalVaccine Injury Compensation Program on account of an injury to her son, KienanFreeman. For the reasons stated below, I conclude that petitioner is entitled tosuch an award, in an amount yet to be determined.Kienan Freeman was born on March 21, 1998. For the first 16 months of life,although he experienced a number of ear infections, Kienan seemed to developnormally and experience generally good health.On July 30, 1999, at the age of 16 months, Kienan received ameasles-mumps-rubella (“MMR”) inoculation. Eight days later, on August 7, 1999,Kienan was taken to a hospital emergency room, after he was found to beexhibiting seemingly involuntary movements described as “twitching” and eyedeviations. He was then observed to suffer an extended seizure in the emergencyroom, which finally subsided after he was administered anti-seizure medications.While some hospital records indicate that the duration of Kienan’s seizureepisode was about 45 minutes, careful analysis of those records indicates thatmore likely his seizure episode lasted 60 to 75 minutes, or more.During the next several weeks, Kienan did not experience any seizures. However,on October 30, 1999, Kienan suffered another prolonged seizure, again promptinga two-day hospitalization. Thereafter, Kienan began to suffer increasinglyfrequent seizures of short duration, without fever. By early February, he wasexperiencing several seizures per week.In the weeks after Kienan’s first seizure episode on August 7, 1999, accordingto his mother, his ability to speak seemed to regress. By early 2000, as hisseizures became frequent, concern about Kienan’s development increased. In Marchof that year, Kienan was assessed by a multi-disciplinary team, and found to besignificantly delayed in his development. Since that time, Kienan has continuedto suffer from seizures, and has proven to be significantly delayed in mentaland other developmental abilities. No cause for his seizures and retardation hasever been definitively diagnosed.EVIDENCE SUPPORTS AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN MEASLES VACCINATION AND NEUROLOGICALDISORDERSThe record in this case contains strong evidence indicating that neurologicdisorders, in the form of both encephalopathy (brain disorder) and seizuredisorder, have been found to be associated with both the measles virus in itsnatural, “wild” form, and with the measles vaccine. One item of evidence is anarticle authored by certain officials of the Department of Health and HumanServices, in fact the very officials who administer the Program for theSecretary of Health and Human Services. The article notes that encephalopathyserious enough to cause death or permanent nervous system impairment is known tobe associated with infection by the wild measles virus. The article’s authorsthen examined cases in which persons suffered encephalopathies withoutdetermined cause within 15 days after a measles vaccination. Observing that suchencephalopathies most often occurred on the eighth or ninth day aftervaccination, the authors concluded that this result “suggests that a causalrelationship between measles vaccine and encephalopathy exists as a rarecomplication of measles immunization.”In addition, Dr. Kinsbourne stated that his review of the medical literatureindicates that the literature supports the view that both the wild measles virusand the measles vaccine can cause encephalopathies, resulting in both seizuresand retardation. And Dr. Snyder also acknowledged both that the wild measlesvirus “has been known to cause encephalitis and seizure disorders,” and thatmedical literature “has associated MMR vaccination with seizure disorders.”OVERALL CONCLUSION CONCERNING “CAUSATION-IN-FACT” ISSUEIn . . . this Section . . . I concluded that Kienan’s seizure of August 7, 1999,likely was caused by his MMR vaccination of July 30, 1999. I then concluded thatthe seizure of August 7, in turn, was likely the cause of Kienan’s subsequentseizure disorder and retardation. Putting those two factual conclusionstogether, I find as fact that Kienan’s seizure disorder and retardation likelywere the result of his MMR vaccination of July 30, 1999.For the reasons stated above, I find that petitioner is entitled to a Programaward on Kienan’s behalf.ALTERNATIVE STORY—AUTISMIt was noted at the hearing that Kienan’s neurologic disorder has features thatmight cause it to be labeled as “atypical autism,” a condition within thecategory of “autistic spectrum disorder.” (Tr. 103-108.) I note, however, thateven assuming that Kienan’s disorder is correctly classified within the“atypical autism” category, that is essentially irrelevant to my rulingconcerning the entitlement issue in this case. As Dr. Kinsbourne explained,Kienan’s autistic-type features seem to be a result of the brain damage thatcaused his severe mental retardation. (Tr. 9, 21-22.) As Dr. Kinsbourne furtherexplained, brain damage is one of the many possible causes of autism. (Tr. 108.)Thus, I cannot see why the fact that Kienan’s disorder may fall within theautism spectrum has any substantial relevance to the question of what causedKienan’s seizure disorder and mental retardation.Accordingly, I also note that, as far as I can see, the outcome of this case hasno significant relevance to the many pending cases before me in which it isasserted that a MMR vaccination caused the vaccinee’s autism disorder. As far asI am aware, none of those cases involves a prolonged seizure happening a week orso after vaccination. Therefore, I do not perceive that the petitioner’s theoryof causation in this case would be of relevance to those cases.Further, I note that my conclusion that Kienan’s neurologic disorder probablywas caused by his MMR inoculation should not be interpreted as a conclusion thatthe MMR inoculation is a particularly dangerous vaccination. To the contrary,given the huge number of MMR inoculations that have been administered world-wideand the very small number of seizures or neurologic disorders reported aftersuch inoculations, it is clear that any risk of neurologic injury from suchinoculations is an extremely small one, confined to very rare instances. Itremains clear that MMR vaccination is generally a very safe procedure, and thatthe risks resulting from failure to receive such vaccinations far exceed anyvery slight risk involved in receiving them.Bailey Banks, by his father Kenneth Banks, Petitioner v. Secretary of theDepartment of Health and Human Services, RespondentSummary: In this MMR injury case, the special master finds that the MMR vaccineinjury resulted in the child developing ADEM which “was severe enough to causelasting, residual damage, and retarded his developmental progress, which fitsunder the generalized heading of Pervasive Developmental Delay, or PDD (anAutism Spectrum Disorder). Additionally, this chain of causation was not tooremote, but was rather a proximate sequence of cause and effect leadinginexorably from vaccination to Pervasive Developmental Delay.”Case No: 02-0738VDate Filed: July 20, 2007Bailey Banks, by his father Kenneth Banks, Petitioner v. Secretary of theDepartment of Health and Human Services, RespondentAbell, Special MasterOn 26 June 2002, the Petitioner filed a petition for compensation under theNational Childhood Vaccine Injury Act alleging that, as a result of the MMRvaccination received on 14 March 2000, his child, Bailey, suffered a seizure andAcute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (“ADEM”), which led to PervasiveDevelopmental Delay (“PDD”), a condition from which he continues to suffer.FACTSBailey Banks was born 26 October 1998. Bailey’s development before hisvaccination (both before and after birth) was normal and healthy.At Bailey’s fifteenth month check-up on 14 March 2000, no health concerns werenoted, and he received the MMR vaccination at issue, his first.Bailey then experienced a seizure 16 days later, on 30 March 2000, during whichBailey’s mother witnessed his eyes rolling back and him choking, and he wastaken to the Emergency Room. At the Emergency Room, Bailey was found to beafebrile and irritable and to have vomited three times. The treating doctor atthe time characterized Bailey’s condition as “new onset seizure” and Bailey wasadmitted to the hospital for observation, where he remained apparently healthyfor the remainder of his stay there.The following day, on 31 March 2007, an MRI scan was taken of Bailey’s brain,which was interpreted by the treating radiologist, Bret Sleight, M.D., as “mostconsistent with a demyelinating process of immune etiology such as may be seenwith ADEM or perhaps post-vaccination.”Bailey then underwent, on 10 April 2000, a full neurological examination,administered by another neurologist, Bryan Philbrook, M.D. Dr. Philbrookconcluded that Bailey suffered from “mild gross motor developmental delay.” Dr.Philbrook also noted his medical opinion that “[w]e reviewed the patient’s MRIand felt that moderate hypomyelination was more likely than a demyelinatingprocess like ADEM, but cannot rule out the latter with certainty.”An EEG performed while Bailey slept on 5 May 2000 was unremarkable. Also, abrain MRI performed on 5 January 2001 evidenced in the same results as the MRIperformed on 31 March 2000, with no significant changes since then.On 22 January 2001 Bailey was examined by another neurologist, Frank Berenson,M.D., who noted that Bailey was suffering from global developmental delays,which included features associated with pervasive developmental delay. However,he added that “[s]ocially there continues to be difficulty. His eye contact isvariable. He has limited to no imaginary pretend play. He continues to biteexcessively. . . .” Furthermore, even though Bailey remained alert during thevisit, his speech development was found to be delayed. Lastly, Bailey continuedto walk with a “somewhat toddling gait” that Dr. Berenson described as “somewhatpuppet-like” in appearance.Beyond the medical records mentioned above, Petitioner’s brief referencesseveral others, engendered between 2001 and the present, that support the claimthat Bailey continued to display neurological developmental delays requiringtherapeutic services.Among the physicians treating Bailey, a neurologist named Dr. Ivan Lopezpersonally examined Bailey and diagnosed Bailey as follows:This patient has developmental delay probably secondary to an episode of acutedemyelinating encephalomyelitis that he had at 18 months of age after thevaccine. He certainly does not [sic] for autism because over here we can find aspecific reason for his condition and this is not just coming up with no reason.Dr. Lopez’s diagnosis appears to conflict with the diagnosis given by Bailey’spediatrician on 20 May 2004, who saddled Bailey’s condition with the generalizedterm “autism”; however, that pediatrician later acknowledged that use of theterm autism was used merely as a simplification for non-medical schoolpersonnel, and that pervasive developmental delay “is the correct [i.e.,technical] diagnosis.” Another pediatrician’s diagnosis noted that Bailey’scondition “seems to be a global developmental delay with autistic features asopposed to an actual autistic spectrum disorder.”EXPERT TESTIMONY AT THE ENTITLEMENT HEARINGMoving on to the alternative hypothesis/diagnosis of autism, Dr. Lopezdistinguishes autism as a more generalized condition without a known etiology,and contrasted it to Bailey’s condition, which he says is clearly attributableto demyelination based on neuroimaging evidence. Dr. Lopez also differentiatedBailey’s condition from autism, because Bailey has been affected in more thanone developmental skill area; he clarified by stating that Bailey has “inducedpervasive developmental delay . . . due to ADEM.” He noted that the conflationof designations resulted from a medical convention created for the sake ofexplanation to laymen, but that the two are not properly interchangeable, butactually quite distinct. Speaking more directly, Dr. Lopez stated that “Baileydoes not have autism because he has a reason for his deficits.”Regarding the medical records that indicated that Bailey was or is autistic, Dr.MacDonald said, “I think he falls into that autistic spectrum pervasivedevelopmental disorder category, and that seems to be fairly consistent.” Henoted, however, that a majority of people “use these terms somewhatinterchangeably.”When questioned about the existence of medical literature which establishes a“relationship between MMR and autism or PDD,” Dr. MacDonald indicated histhought that “all the medical literature is negative in that regard.” Also, hereferenced a dearth of known literature to explain why he sees no connectionbetween ADEM and PDD:I can find no literature relating ADEM to autism or pervasive developmentaldisorder, and by its nature ADEM is a primary demyelinating disorder of thenervous system. . . . PDD is a problem with the neurons, not the white matter ofthe brain, so it doesn’t make sense that autistic children would have had ademyelinating disorder before. In fact, MRI scans [that] have been donerepeatedly in children with PDD/autism don’t show demyelination, so there is noconnection. Even if one believes the child has ADEM, there is no connection tothe diagnosis of PDD.When questioned by the Court . . . Dr. MacDonald . . . ultimately concluded that“Bailey falls into the large group of children with autism/PDD in which by ourcurrent evidence-based medicine we rarely can make a specific diagnosis.”The Court specifically asked Dr. Lopez to explain the causative, logical linkbetween the disputed occurrence ADEM and the undisputed PDD from which Baileynow suffers. Dr. Lopez conceded that “the majority of patients with ADEM improvesignificantly,” but added that “the exception to this rule is when patients havebeen exposed to measles, just like in the case of MMR vaccine,” in which case“sequela may occur in up to 50 percent of patients.” He elaborated that suchsequela potentially include “mental syndromes such as PDD and others” and opinedthat “up to 50 percent of patients . . . who have had ADEM will show[,] as aconsequence of this monophasic condition[,] PDD.”THE COURT’S CONCLUSIONSOn its face, Petitioner has proffered a credible theory that, if the Courtaccepts its component parts, evidences a chain of logical and biologicalconnection. It seems that Respondent’s challenge in disputing and denyingPetitioner’s case in chief is a question of degree not kind: whether Bailey’slack of balance amounts to ataxia, whether Bailey’s PDD constitutes a mentalhandicap, etc. Respondent acknowledges that Bailey currently suffers from PDD,and that the MMR vaccine can cause ADEM. The only link on the logical “chain” ofPetitioner’s theory that Respondent really disputes, as it relates to thequestion of “can it?” (i.e., biologic plausibility), is whether ADEM can lead toPDD. Most of Respondent’s contentions focus more narrowly on the issue of “didit?”: i.e., was the mechanism proffered by Petitioner’s expert really at work inthis individual in this set of facts?Respondent seems to have abandoned the earlier argument that Bailey sufferedfrom autism, instead of PDD. The Court notes the various similarities betweenBailey’s condition and autism as defined above, but nonetheless rules that PDDbetter and more precisely describes Bailey’s condition and symptoms than doesautism. Respondent’s acknowledgment serves to reaffirm the Court’s conclusion onthis point.This series of circumstances, corroborated by the medical records prepared bytreating doctors, fits much more closely with the monophasic illness of ADEMthan it does with any other etiology proffered by either party. Combined withthe radiologists’ analysis of the MRI scans, and the Court’s finding of ataxia,the Court accepts that Petitioner has met the burden of proof in showing thefact that Bailey more likely than not suffered from ADEM.Having suffered from ADEM, it remains to be discussed if and how the ADEM leddirectly to PDD as a sequela. In sum, the Court’s factual findings are fourfold:1. Bailey did show evidence of ataxia in the period surrounding his seizure,following his vaccination;2. Such ataxia, when considered in conjunction with the radiological resultsand some other “soft indicia”, together support the Court’s finding that Baileydid, in fact, suffer from ADEM.3. Bailey’s ADEM was caused-in-fact and proximately caused by his vaccination.It is well-understood that the vaccination at issue can cause ADEM, and theCourt finds, on the record filed herein, that it did actually cause the ADEM.4. Bailey’s ADEM was severe enough to cause lasting, residual damage, andretarded his developmental progress, which fits under the generalized heading ofPervasive Developmental Delay, or PDD. Additionally, this chain of causation wasnot too remote, but was rather a proximate sequence of cause and effect leadinginexorably from vaccination to Pervasive Developmental Delay.Therefore, in light of the foregoing, the Court rules in favor of entitlement inthis matter.DEFINITIONSAcute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is “an acute or subacuteencephalomyelitis or infiltration and demyelination; it occurs most commonlyfollowing an acute viral infection, especially measles, but may occur without arecognizable antecedent. . . . It is believed to be a manifestation of anautoimmune attack on the myelin of the central nervous system. Clinicalmanifestations include fever, headache, vomiting, and drowsiness progressing tolethargy and coma; tremor, seizures, and paralysis may also occur; mortalityranges from 5 to 20 per cent; many survivors have residual neurologicaldeficits.” Dorland’s Illustrated Medical Dictionary (30th ed. 2003) (Saunders)at 610.Pervasive Developmental Delay describes a class of conditions, and it isapparent from the record that the parties and the medical records are referringto Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (“PDD-NOS”):Pervasive Developmental Disorder, Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS) is a‘subthreshold’ condition in which some—but not all—features of autism or anotherexplicitly identified Pervasive Developmental Disorder are identified. PDD-NOSis often incorrectly referred to as simply “PDD.” The term PDD refers to theclass of conditions to which autism belongs. PDD is NOT itself a diagnosis,while PDD-NOS IS a diagnosis. The term Pervasive Developmental Disorder—NotOtherwise Specified (PDD-NOS; also referred to as “atypical personalitydevelopment,” “atypical PDD,” or “atypical autism”) is included in DSM-IV toencompass cases where there is marked impairment of social interaction,communication, and/or stereotyped behavior patterns or interest, but when fullfeatures for autism or another explicitly defined PDD are not met.It should be emphasized that this “subthreshold” category is thus definedimplicitly, that is, no specific guidelines for diagnosis are provided. Whiledeficits in peer relations and unusual sensitivities are typically noted, socialskills are less impaired than in classical autism. The lack of definition(s) forthis relatively heterogeneous group of children presents problems for researchon this condition. The limited available evidence suggest that children withPDD-NOS probably come to professional attention rather later than is the casewith autistic children, and that intellectual deficits are less common. The YaleChild Study Center’s Developmental Disabilities Clinic Webpage, article onPDD-NOS, available at http://www.med.yale.edu/chldstdy/autism/pddnos.html[http://www.med.yale.edu/chldstdy/autism/pddnos.html]. See also Diagnostic andStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., 2000) at 69 et seq. In theinterest of consistency, the Court will follow the convention adhered to by themedical records and by the parties in this case, and this condition will bereferred to herein as “PDD.”“An autism spectrum disorder is a brain disorder affecting a person’s ability tocommunicate, form relationships, and/or respond appropriately to theenvironment. Such disorders sometimes result in death. The ‘spectrum’ of suchdisorders includes relatively high-functioning persons with speech and languageintact, as well as persons who are mentally retarded, mute, or with seriouslanguage delays. Symptoms may include, but are not limited to, avoidance of eyecontact, seeming ‘deafness,’ abrupt loss of language, unawareness ofenvironment, physical abusiveness, inaccessibility, fixation, bizarre behavior,‘flapping,’ repetitive and/or obsessive behavior, insensitivity to pain, socialwithdrawal, and extreme sensitivity to sounds, textures, tastes, smells, andlight.” Autism General Order # 1 (Fed. Cl. Spec. Mstr. Jul. 3, 2002), quotingNational Institute of Mental Health, Publication 97-4023.David and Sandra Bastian, Legal Representatives of Kyle Bastian, v. Secretary ofthe Department of Health and Human Services.Summary: In this DPT injury case, the special master rules that the childsuffered a Table encephalopathy with sequela, including autism.Case No: 90-1161VDate Filed: September 22, 1994David and Sandra Bastian, Legal Representatives of Kyle Bastian, v. Secretary ofthe Department of Health and Human Services.Abell, Special MasterPetitioners alleged that as a direct result of a 28 September 1984diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (DPT) vaccination, Kyle suffered a Tableencephalopathy with sequela.Kyle M. Bastian was born on 5 March 1983 at Holy Cross Hospital, Silver Spring,Maryland. Prior to his fourth DPT vaccination, Kyle suffered from a series ofcolds, ear and throat infections, and fevers. On 28 September 1984, atapproximately 10:00 a.m., Kyle received his fourth DPT vaccination at theoffices of Dr. Richard J. Hollander, Silver Spring, Maryland. Kyle had receiveda well baby checkup that morning by Dr. Hollander and according to Mrs. Bastian,Dr. Hollander thought Kyle had “excellent hand skills” and was “impressed with[Kyle’s] intelligence and curiosity.” Mrs. Bastian was instructed to give KyleTylenol when she got home.Upon arriving home, Mrs. Bastian put Kyle down for a nap. On this day, Kyleawoke from his nap with a “screeching sound,” as though he was in pain and atemperature of 103 degrees F. Mrs. Bastian called her physician’s office and asa consequence thereto administered Tylenol to Kyle and sponged him down everyhalf hour. Kyle’s screeching continued off and on for most of the afternoon ofthe 28th. By 7:30 p.m. Kyle’s temperature was 104.5 degrees. After speaking toDr. Hollander again, Mrs. Bastian continued with the Tylenol and sponging untilaround 11:00 p.m. Mrs. Bastian put Kyle to bed with her. At about 1:30 a.m. on29 September 1984 she found Kyle cyanotic, his whole body rigid, and his eyes“up in his head.” She immediately called the paramedics and Kyle was rushed toHoly Cross Hospital. In the hospital emergency room, Kyle continued “screeching”on and off. Kyle was kept at the hospital less than an hour and then returnedhome.At approximately 9:30 a.m. on 29 September 1984 Mrs. Bastian took Kyle to Dr.Hollander’s office for a recheck. When they returned home an hour or two later,Kyle began developing hives all over his body. When Mrs. Bastian put Kyle down,“he just toppled over.” He had a fever of 105 degrees and he “started shakingall over.” Accordingly, Mrs. Bastian took Kyle to the emergency room for asecond time on the 29th. The contemporaneous medical records clearly indicateKyle had a febrile seizure and hives within 72 hours of the inoculation and, infact, was seen at the Holy Cross Hospital Emergency Room for his seizure. Kylereturned home from the emergency room, apparently upon Mrs. Bastian’s request.Mrs. Bastian noted that on 30 September 1984 Kyle was “totally out of it,” hecould not sit up, had a fixed stare, and made no eye contact. This conditioncontinues to this day. Mrs. Bastian testified that after the DPT vaccinationKyle’s eating habits “completely changed.” Immediately following the vaccinationhe had “no appetite for a couple of days” and would only consume liquids, notsolid foods. Kyle’s parents subsequently expressed concern regarding possiblehearing loss.To Mrs. Bastian, Kyle never seemed to come back—he was never the same child hehad been prior to the immunization.EXPERT TESTIMONYDr. Quinn unequivocally stated that Kyle suffers today from an encephalopathy.She testified he manifested the following signs and symptoms of anencephalopathy within 72 hours of the injection in question: screaming, loss ofmuscle tone or hypotonia, lethargy, irritability, a 10 minute seizure, cyanosis,listlessness, and inconsolable crying.Dr. Quinn opined that Kyle suffers from pervasive developmental disorder (PDD).Dr. Spiro, however, opined that Kyle is autistic.Dr. Quinn explicated on the differences between autism and PDD. Dr. Quinnpointed out that PDD and autism are sometimes incorrectly used interchangeably.She stated that autism may be one of a spectrum of disorders under PDD but thatit is a separate classifiable disorder. She concluded that Kyle does not haveautism, but has PDD. Dr. Quinn explained that PDD is caused by a brain insult.Dr. Quinn indicated Kyle’s post-vaccinal encephalopathy was the brain insultwhich in turn resulted in his PDD. Dr. Quinn opined, to a reasonable degree ofmedical certainty, that Kyle’s condition is permanent.Dr. Ira Lourie, treating child psychiatrist, also testified. Kyle was firstreferred to Dr. Lourie’s practice in 1990. Dr. Lourie indicated that Kyle is notautistic, and, in fact, he is not certain that he even has PDD—although he hascharacteristics of PDD. Kyle has never actually been diagnosed with autismaccording to Dr. Lourie’s analysis of the medical records. Nor is he mentallyretarded.Dr. Spiro opined that Kyle suffers from “autistic spectrum disorder” which isthe cause of his developmental problems. Nevertheless, he admitted that no oneelse has ever diagnosed Kyle as autistic. Further, he testified that to hisknowledge, there is no medically recognized evidence that PDD can be a sequel tosome sort of brain trauma.In sum, Dr. Spiro recognized that there are other pediatric neurologists whoacknowledge brain trauma as a cause of autism encompassed within PDD, but he isin disagreement with them.Regarding sequela herein, petitioners have met their burden by proving by apreponderance of the evidence that Kyle suffers from PDD and that the on-Tableencephalopathy medically could have caused the PDD. In addition, respondent hasfailed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Kyle’s injury was causedby any factor unrelated to the administration of the vaccine.When the undersigned weighs the totality of the medical records and the crediblefact testimony, the following neurological signs and symptoms are found to haveoccurred by a preponderance of the evidence on Table: (a) a ten minute grand malor generalized seizure, (b) high-pitched screaming, (c) hypotonia, (d) lethargyand/or listlessness, (e) cyanosis, and (f) the beginning of a loss oflanguage/speech development and eye contact. Subsequent to the Table periodthere was an evident loss of milestones. The sum of the evidence establishesthat Kyle presented as a normal child antecedent to the fourth DPT inoculationof 28 September 1984, within three days manifested numerous ominous indicia, asindicated supra, and thereafter, “he just never seemed to come back. He was notthe same child he was before the shot.”Based upon the facts presented herein, this court is reluctant to find by apreponderance of the evidence that Kyle is autistic when no examining physicianhas ever diagnosed him as such.Dr. Quinn, who has conscientiously diagnosed Kyle over time, linked Kyle’scurrent condition to his DPT vaccination. Both Drs. Quinn and Lourie testifiedthat Kyle exhibits some autistic symptomatology but is not autistic.

Every “flu season” features waves ofadvertisements to get a flu shot. One can now receive the yearly flu vaccine ina local pharmacy. Every school year begins with notifications to Americanfamilies to vaccinate their children as the mandated by the various states.Vaccines are the only drugs that people are compelled to give to their children.The government agency that compels the use of these drugs—the Department ofHealth and Human Services—also runs the National Vaccine Injury CompensationProgram (NVICP). While millions are spent on pro-vaccination messages, fewdollars are spent notifying the public about the NVICP. The NVICP may be themost secret public program in federal government. Hardly anyone knows of itsexistence. The people who work in the program rarely speak out (although somehave after leaving) and seem driven to say as little about the reality ofvaccine injury as possible.When Congressman Darrell Issa, chairman of the House Oversight and GovernmentReform Committee, sought to hold hearings on the NVICP in the fall of 2013,pro-vaccine advocates exerted political pressure to shut the congressionalinvestigation down. Once again, the program avoided the spotlight, and thereality of vaccine injury was kept away from the public.In writing this book, we have sought to pull the cover off of the program andlet the public see actual cases of vaccine injury. We believe that doing so is apublic service because the public ought to be clearly informed about adversereactions to the only drugs that they are required to give their children.Vaccine injuries happen, and not knowing about them helps no one.Further, the past public disclosures on vaccine injuries have led to real andsignificant improvements in vaccine safety and effectiveness. Raising publicawareness and encouraging discourse on vaccine injury is critical to increasingunderstanding of the value and limitations of these drugs.It is critical to study vaccine injuries in the same way that it is critical tostudy aviation accidents. The National Transportation Safety Board investigatesand analyzes all air travel crashes and issues aviation accident reports, whichare open and available to the public. We need the same for vaccine injuries.It is important that people learn to recognize and respond to vaccine injuries.That is why we have included information about the vaccines covered by theNVICP, how to file a claim with the program, and how to utilize the VaccineAdverse Event Reporting System. As of this writing, the NVICP is the only legalvenue for filing a claim for vaccine injury. The interpretation of the 1986 Actby the United States Supreme Court in the Brusewitz case all but excluded othercivil remedies.The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program is the only redress for peoplewho feel that they have been injured by a vaccine to receive compensation.The venue for such people to receive justice has not yet been realized."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX"},{"pageContent":"VAERS : THE VACCINE ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING SYSTEMFrom vaers.hhs.govWhat is VAERSThe Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is a national vaccine safetysurveillance program co-sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). VAERS collects andanalyzes information from reports of adverse events (possible side effects)following vaccination. Since 1990, VAERS has received more than two hundredthousand reports, most of which describe mild side effects such as fever. Veryrarely, people experience serious adverse events. By monitoring these events,VAERS helps identify new safety concerns, and helps make sure the benefits ofvaccines continue to be far greater than the risks. VAERS data are monitored to• Detect new, unusual, or rare vaccine adverse events• Monitor increases in known adverse events• Identify potential patient risk factors for particular types of adverseevents• Identify vaccine lots with increased numbers or types of reported adverseevents• Assess the safety of newly licensed vaccinesWho reports to VAERSAnyone can file a VAERS report, including health-care providers, manufacturers,and vaccine recipients. The majority of VAERS reports are sent in by vaccinemanufacturers (37 percent) and health care providers (36 percent). The remainingreports are obtained from state immunization programs (10 percent), vaccinerecipients (or their parents/guardians, 7 percent) and other sources (10percent). Vaccine recipients or their parents or guardians are encouraged toseek the help of their health-care professional in filling out the VAERS form.Each report provides valuable information that is added to the VAERS database.Accurate and complete reporting of post-vaccination events supplies theinformation needed for evaluation of vaccine safety. The CDC and FDA use VAERSinformation to ensure the safest strategies of vaccine use and to further reducethe rare risks associated with vaccines.What can be reported to VAERSVAERS seeks reports of any clinically significant medical event that occursafter vaccination, even if the reporter cannot be certain that the event wascaused by the vaccine. CDC/ISO and FDA review adverse reports; VAERS hasidentified important signals that after further research resulted in changes tovaccine recommendations. VAERS encourages the reporting of any clinicallysignificant adverse event that occurs after the administration of any vaccinelicensed in the United States. You should report adverse events even if you areunsure whether a vaccine caused the event. Knowingly filing a false VAERS reportwith the intent to mislead the Department of Health and Human Services is aviolation of federal law (18 U.S. Code § 1001) punishable by fine andimprisonment.Why should I report to VAERSEach report provides valuable information that is added to the VAERS database.Accurate and complete reporting of post-vaccination adverse events supplies theinformation needed for evaluation of vaccine safety.

Youor your health-care provider may be contacted for follow-up information by VAERSstaff after your report is received. These selected reports are followed up by ateam of health-care professionals to obtain additional information (such asmedical records and autopsy reports) to provide as complete a picture of thecase as possible. All records sent to VAERS are kept confidential as required bylaw. The patient’s consent is not required to release the medical records toVAERS.

If you have questions about how the Health Insurance Portability andAccountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) applies to VAERS, please visit our VAERSPrivacy Policies and Disclaimers section.Are all adverse events reported to VAERS caused by vaccines?No. VAERS receives reports of many adverse events that occur after vaccination.Some occur coincidentally following vaccination, while others may be caused byvaccination. Studies help determine if a vaccine really caused an adverse event.Just because an adverse event happened after a person received a vaccine doesnot mean the vaccine caused the adverse event. Other factors, such as theperson’s medical history and other medicines the person took near the time ofthe vaccination, may have caused the adverse event. It is important to rememberthat many adverse events reported to VAERS may not be caused by vaccines.Although VAERS can rarely provide definitive evidence of causal associationsbetween vaccines and particular risks, its unique role as a national spontaneousreporting system enables the early detection of signals that can then be morerigorously investigated.How Do I find out what adverse events have been reported to VAERS?The adverse events reported to VAERS are included in the public data sets. Afteraccepting the terms of use, you can follow the instructions to sort the recordsby vaccine type, or search for a specific adverse event.Which government agencies manage VAERS?VAERS is a national passive reporting system co-managed by the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)agencies of the US Department of Health and Human Services.Does VAERS provide medical advice?No. Please contact a health-care provider to discuss the specifics of your case.Is VAERS involved in the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program?No. The Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), which compensates peoplewhose injuries may have been caused by vaccines recommended by CDC for routineuse in children, is administered by the Health Resources and ServicesAdministration. The VICP is separate from the VAERS program, and reporting anevent to VAERS does not file a claim for compensation to the VICP.For more information about the VICP, call (800) 338-2382 or visit the VICPwebsite.Is there a compensation program for individuals who are injured by the H1N1vaccineYes, the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP) is a separatefederal government program directed to compensate certain individuals seriouslyinjured by countermeasures covered, such as the pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza,smallpox, and anthrax vaccines, under declarations issued by the Secretary ofthe US Department of Health and Human Services. Information on the CICP can beobtained by visiting their website at http://www.hrsa.gov/cicp/[http://www.hrsa.gov/cicp/] or calling (855) 266-2427 (855-266-CICP). Please beaware that reporting an event to VAERS does not constitute filing forcompensation with the CICP.Does VAERS provide general vaccine information?No. VAERS only collects and analyzes adverse event reports. For generalinformation about vaccine safety, visit CDC’s Vaccine Safety website. Forinformation about specific vaccines, immunization schedules, publications onvaccine-preventable diseases, and more, visit CDC’s Vaccines and Immunizationswebsite or call the CDC INFO Contact Center Information Line at (800) 232-4636.Where can more information about VAERS be found?You can get more information about VAERS by:• Sending e-mail to info@vaers.org [info@vaers.org]• Calling the toll-free VAERS Information Line at (800) 822-7967• Faxing inquiries to the toll-free fax line at (877) 721-0366• Visiting the Food and Drug Administration• Visiting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"pageContent":"HOW TO FILE A CLAIM WITH THE NATIONAL VACCINE INJURY COMPENSATION PROGRAMFrom www.hrsa.gov [http://www.hrsa.gov]You may file a claim if you believe you were injured by a vaccine, if you arethe parent or legal guardian of a child or disabled adult believed to have beeninjured by a vaccine, or if you are the legal representative of the estate of adeceased individual whose death you believe was caused by a vaccine. An injurymust have lasted for more than six months after the vaccine was given orresulted in a hospital stay and surgery.All claims must be filed with the US Court of Federal Claims and must includethe claim (or petition) and two copies, a Court of Federal Claims cover sheet,medical records and/or other documentation, and a $350 filing fee.Compensation varies, depending on the injury, and can include as much as$250,000 for pain and suffering, lost earnings, legal fees, and/or a reasonableamount for past and future care. For a death, you may receive as much as$250,000 for the estate and legal fees.You must file your claim within three years after the first symptom of thevaccine injury or within two years of a death and four years after the start ofthe first symptom of the vaccine injury that resulted in the death.1. Understand the process. Vaccine compensation claims are managed andadjudicated by the Office of Special Masters, within the US Court of FederalClaims. You do not need a lawyer to file a claim; however, since this is a legalprocess, most people use a lawyer.2. Who may file. You may file a claim if you received a vaccine covered by theVICP and believe that you have been injured by this vaccine. You may file if youare the parent or legal guardian of a child or disabled adult who received andwho you believe was injured by a covered vaccine, or if you are the legalrepresentative of the estate of a deceased person who received a covered vaccineand whose death you believe resulted from that vaccination. You may file a claimif you are not a US citizen.• Some people who receive vaccines outside of the U.S. may be eligible forcompensation. The vaccines must have been covered by the VICP and given in thefollowing circumstances:images [../Images/ocircle.jpg] the injured person must have received a vaccinein the US trust territories; orimages [../Images/ocircle.jpg] if the vaccine was administered outside of theUnited States or its trust territories:1. the injured person must have been a US citizen serving in the military or aUS government employee, or have been a dependent of such a citizen; or2. the injured person must have received a vaccine manufactured by a vaccinecompany located in the United States and returned to the United States withinsix months after the date of vaccination.• In addition, to be eligible to file a claim, the effects of the person’sinjury must have:1. lasted for more than six months after the vaccine was given; or2. resulted in a hospital stay and surgery; or3. resulted in death.3. Filing information and deadlines. To be eligible to file a claim, theeffects of the person’s injury must have:1. lasted for more than six months after the vaccine was given; or2. resulted in a hospital stay and surgery; or3. resulted in death.You must file your claim within three years after the first symptom of thevaccine injury or within two years of a death and four years after the start ofthe first symptom of the vaccine injury that resulted in the death.When a new vaccine is covered by the VICP or when a new injury/condition isadded to the vaccine injury table (Table), claims that do not meet the generalfiling deadlines must be filed within two years from the date the vaccine orinjury/condition is added to the table for injuries or deaths that occurred upto eight years before the table change. The table lists and explains injuriesthat are presumed to be caused by vaccines.For example, the hepatitis A vaccine was covered by the VICP as of December 1,2004. Under the general filing deadline for an injury, the claim must be filedwithin three years after the first symptom of the vaccine injury. However,claims that do not meet the general filing deadlines must be filed by December1, 2006, for injuries or deaths that occurred on or after December 1, 1996.As a general filing rule, for individuals who are filing a claim, theappropriate filing deadline is the one above that provides the most time to filean injury or a death claim.First, a claim must be filed by or on the behalf of the individual thought to beinjured by a vaccine covered by the VICP. A claim is started by filing a legaldocument called a petition that is prepared by you or your lawyer to requestcompensation under the VICP. Anyone who files a claim is called a petitioner.The only form required is the court’s cover sheet for the claim. You may obtaina copy of the cover sheet and a sample claim by calling 202-357-6400. Your claimshould address the following information:• who was injured by the vaccine;• which vaccine caused the injury;• when the vaccine was given;• the city and state or country where the vaccine was given;• the type of injury;• when the first symptom of the injury appeared; and• how long the effects of the injury lasted.Your claim should also include your medical records and/or other appropriatedocuments, the court’s cover sheet, and the $400 filing fee. If you are unableto pay this fee, call 202-357-6400 for assistance. The original claim and twocopies plus a $400 filing fee should be sent to:ClerkUS Court of Federal Claims717 Madison Place, NWWashington, DC 20439Medical Records and Other DocumentationYou must include certain medical records and/or other appropriate documents withthe claim. If some medical records are unavailable, you must identify thoserecords and explain why they are unavailable. The medical review and processingof the claim may be delayed if you do not include the appropriate medicalrecords and other documents with the claim.In order to ensure that your claim is processed in a timely manner, the VICPsuggests that you include the following medical records and other documents whenfiling your claim with the Court and the Secretary of Health and Human Services,c/o Director, Division of Vaccine Injury Compensation.Types of Medical Records1. Prenatal and Birth Records*• Mother’s prenatal record• Delivery record• Birth certificate• Newborn hospital record, including providers’ notes, and radiology/labresults• Any hospitalization face sheet with final diagnosis2.

However, since this is a legalprocess, most people use a lawyer. If certain minimal requirements are met, theVICP will pay your lawyer’s fees and other legal costs related to your claim,whether or not you are paid for a vaccine injury or death. The VICP will not paythe fees of petitioners representing themselves, but will pay their legal costs,whether or not the claim is paid, as long as certain minimal requirements aremet.Filing a Claim Outside the VICPMost of the time, you must first file and have your claim processed with theVICP before a civil lawsuit can be filed against the vaccine company or theperson who gave the vaccine. If you would like to file a civil lawsuit outsideof the VICP, contact a lawyer for advice.Obtaining a List of Lawyers Who File VICP ClaimsVaccine Attorneys lists attorneys who have agreed, upon request, to acceptreferrals in certain vaccine injury cases and is compiled by the US Court ofFederal Claims.

To obtain thesedocuments, you may visit the US Court of Federal Claims website or call202-357-6400. Most petitioners use a lawyer, since this is a legal process andthe rules of the court are very specific and must be followed. The process forfiling a claim is:1. the petitioner or petitioner’s lawyer sends one original and two copies ofthe claim along with the medical records, other appropriate documents, and a$400 filing fee to the court;2. the petitioner or petitioner’s lawyer sends one copy of the claim,including the medical records and other appropriate documents, to the Secretaryof Health and Human Services, c/o Director, Division of Vaccine InjuryCompensation;3. the court sends one copy of the claim and medical records to the DOJ;4. HHS reviews the medical information in the claim, and this review is sentto the DOJ lawyer who represents the Secretary of Health and Human Services;5. the DOJ lawyer reviews the legal aspects of the claim and writes a report;6. the HHS and DOJ reviews are combined into one report that is sent to thecourt and the petitioner or the petitioner’s lawyer;7. the DOJ and the petitioner or the petitioner’s lawyer take legal action toresolve the claim;8. a “special master” (a lawyer appointed by the judges of the Court) decideswhether the claim will be paid and how much will be paid for the claim;9. if the special master decides to pay the claim, the petitioner must make adecision to accept or reject the special master’s decision in writing; and10. the special master’s decision may be appealed to a judge of the court by thepetitioner or HHS, then to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and,finally, to the US Supreme Court.Reasons for CompensationTo be paid, you must prove that:• the injured person received a vaccine listed on the vaccine injury table(table); and• the first symptom of the injury/condition on the table as defined in theQualifications and Aids to Interpretation (Aids) occurred within the time periodlisted on the table; or• the vaccine caused the injury; or• the vaccine caused an existing illness to get worse (significantlyaggravated).In addition, the court must determine that the injury or death did not resultfrom any other possible causes.Types of Payments AwardedFor an injury, you may be paid:• a reasonable amount for past and future nonreimbursable medical, custodialcare, and rehabilitation costs, and related expenses (there is no limit on theamount a person with an injury may be paid for these types of expenses; paymentsare based on your vaccine injury needs);• up to $250,000 for actual and projected pain and suffering;• lost earnings; and/or• reasonable lawyers’ fees and other legal costs or legal costs, not fees, ofpetitioners representing themselves, if your claim was filed on a reasonablebasis and in good faith.For a death, you may be paid:• up to $250,000 as a death benefit for the estate of the deceased; and• reasonable lawyers’ fees and other legal costs or legal costs, not fees, ofpetitioners representing themselves, if your claim was filed on a reasonablebasis and in good faith.4. File a claim with the US Court of Federal Claims. The claim for compensationis a legal document, called a petition, that you or your lawyer prepares andfiles by sending it to the US Court of Federal Claims.Who determines compensation:The U.S. Court of Federal Claims makes the final decision regarding petitions,compensation and the amount of the award.Vaccines covered by the NVICP:Diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (DTP, DTaP, Tdap, DT, Td, or TT)Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib)Hepatitis A (HAV)Hepatitis B (HBV)Human papillomavirus (HPV)Influenza (TIV, LAIV) [given each year during the flu season]Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR, MR, M, R)Meningococcal (MCV4, MPSV4)Polio (OPV or IPV)Pneumococcal conjugate (PCV)Rotavirus (RV)Varicella (VZV)Vaccine injury table:The vaccine injury table (table) makes it easier for some people to getcompensation. The table lists and explains injuries/conditions that are presumedto be caused by vaccines. It also lists time periods in which the first symptomof these injuries/conditions must occur after receiving the vaccine. If thefirst symptom of these injuries/conditions occurs within the listed timeperiods, it is presumed that the vaccine was the cause of the injury orcondition unless another cause is found. For example, if you received thetetanus vaccines and had a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) within fourhours after receiving the vaccine, it is presumed that the tetanus vaccinecaused the injury if no other cause is found.If your injury/condition is not on the table or if your injury/condition did notoccur within the time period on the table, you must prove that the vaccinecaused the injury/condition. Such proof must be based on medical records oropinion, which may include expert witness testimony.Due to a technical error, the table posted on the VICP website from October 25,2013, to November 4, 2013, should not be referenced or used.

The following qualifications andaids to interpretation shall apply to the vaccine injury table to paragraph (a)of this section:(1) Anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock. For purposes of paragraph (a) of thissection, anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock mean an acute, severe, andpotentially lethal systemic allergic reaction. Most cases resolve withoutsequela. Signs and symptoms begin minutes to a few hours after exposure. Death,if it occurs, usually results from airway obstruction caused by laryngeal edemaor bronchospasm and may be associated with cardiovascular collapse. Othersignificant clinical signs and symptoms may include the following: cyanosis,hypotension, bradycardia, tachycardia, arrhythmia, edema of the pharynx and/ortrachea and/or larynx with stridor and dyspnea. Autopsy findings may includeacute emphysema which results from lower respiratory tract obstruction, edema ofthe hypopharynx, epiglottis, larynx, or trachea and minimal findings ofeosinophilia in the liver, spleen, and lungs. When death occurs within minutesof exposure and without signs of respiratory distress, there may not besignificant pathologic findings.(2) Encephalopathy. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, a vaccinerecipient shall be considered to have suffered an encephalopathy only if suchrecipient manifests, within the applicable period, an injury meeting thedescription below of an acute encephalopathy, and then a chronic encephalopathypersists in such person for more than six months beyond the date of vaccination.(i) An acute encephalopathy is one that is sufficiently severe so as to requirehospitalization (whether or not hospitalization occurred).(A) For children less than eighteen months of age who present without anassociated seizure event, an acute encephalopathy is indicated by asignificantly decreased level of consciousness lasting for at least twenty-fourhours. Those children less than eighteen months of age who present following aseizure shall be viewed as having an acute encephalopathy if their significantlydecreased level of consciousness persists beyond twenty-four hours and cannot beattributed to a postictal state (seizure) or medication.(B) For adults and children eighteen months of age or older, an acuteencephalopathy is one that persists for at least twenty-four hours andcharacterized by at least two of the following:(1) A significant change in mental status that is not medication related;specifically, a confusional state, or a delirium, or a psychosis;(2) A significantly decreased level of consciousness, which is independent of aseizure and cannot be attributed to the effects of medication; and(3) A seizure associated with loss of consciousness.(C) Increased intracranial pressure may be a clinical feature of acuteencephalopathy in any age group.(D) A “significantly decreased level of consciousness” is indicated by thepresence of at least one of the following clinical signs for at leasttwenty-four hours or greater (see paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A) and (b)(2)(i)(B) ofthis section for applicable timeframes):(1) Decreased or absent response to environment (responds, if at all, only toloud voice or painful stimuli);(2) Decreased or absent eye contact (does not fix gaze upon family members orother individuals); or(3) Inconsistent or absent responses to external stimuli (does not recognizefamiliar people or things).(E) The following clinical features alone, or in combination, do not demonstratean acute encephalopathy or a significant change in either mental status or levelof consciousness as described above: sleepiness; irritability (fussiness);high-pitched and unusual screaming; persistent, inconsolable crying; and bulgingfontanelle. Seizures in themselves are not sufficient to constitute a diagnosisof encephalopathy. In the absence of other evidence of an acute encephalopathy,seizures shall not be viewed as the first symptom or manifestation of the onsetof an acute encephalopathy.(ii) Chronic encephalopathy occurs when a change in mental or neurologic status,first manifested during the applicable time period, persists for a period of atleast six months from the date of vaccination. Individuals who return to anormal neurologic state after the acute encephalopathy shall not be presumed tohave suffered residual neurologic damage from that event; any subsequent chronicencephalopathy shall not be presumed to be a sequela of the acuteencephalopathy. If a preponderance of the evidence indicates that a child’schronic encephalopathy is secondary to genetic, prenatal, or perinatal factors,that chronic encephalopathy shall not be considered to be a condition set forthin the table.(iii) An encephalopathy shall not be considered to be a condition set forth inthe table if in a proceeding on a petition, it is shown by a preponderance ofthe evidence that the encephalopathy was caused by an infection, a toxin, ametabolic disturbance, a structural lesion, a genetic disorder or trauma(without regard to whether the cause of the infection, toxin, trauma, metabolicdisturbance, structural lesion, or genetic disorder is known). If at the time adecision is made on a petition filed under section 2111(b) of the act for avaccine-related injury or death, it is not possible to determine the cause by apreponderance of the evidence of an encephalopathy, the encephalopathy shall beconsidered to be a condition set forth in the table.(iv) In determining whether or not an encephalopathy is a condition set forth inthe table, the court shall consider the entire medical record.(3) [Reserved](4) Seizure and convulsion. For purposes of paragraphs (b) (2) of this section,the terms, “seizure” and “convulsion” include myoclonic, generalizedtonic-clonic (grand mal), and simple and complex partial seizures. Absence(petit mal) seizures shall not be considered to be a condition set forth in thetable. Jerking movements or staring episodes alone are not necessarily anindication of seizure activity.(5) Sequela. The term “sequela” means a condition or event which was actuallycaused by a condition listed in the vaccine injury table.(6) Chronic arthritis. (i) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section,chronic arthritis may be found in a person with no history in the three yearsprior to vaccination of arthropathy (joint disease) on the basis of:(A) Medical documentation, recorded within thirty days after the onset, ofobjective signs of acute arthritis (joint swelling) that occurred between sevenand forty-two days after a rubella vaccination;(B) Medical documentation (recorded within three years after the onset of acutearthritis) of the persistence of objective signs of intermittent or continuousarthritis for more than six months following vaccination; and(C) Medical documentation of an antibody response to the rubella virus.(ii) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following shall not beconsidered as chronic arthritis: musculoskeletal disorders such as diffuseconnective tissue diseases (including but not limited to rheumatoid arthritis,juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis,mixed connective tissue disease, polymyositis/determatomyositis, fibromyalgia,necrotizing vascultitis and vasculopathies and Sjögren’s Syndrome), degenerativejoint disease, infectious agents other than rubella (whether by direct invasionor as an immune reaction), metabolic and endocrine diseases, trauma, neoplasms,neuropathic disorders, bone and cartilage disorders and arthritis associatedwith ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, Reiter’ssyndrome, or blood disorders.(iii) Arthralgia (joint pain) or stiffness without joint swelling shall not beviewed as chronic arthritis for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section.(7) Brachial neuritis. (i) This term is defined as dysfunction limited to theupper extremity nerve plexus (i.e., its trunks, divisions, or cords) withoutinvolvement of other peripheral (e.g., nerve roots or a single peripheral nerve)or central (e.g., spinal cord) nervous system structures. A deep, steady, oftensevere aching pain in the shoulder and upper arm usually heralds onset of thecondition. The pain is followed in days or weeks by weakness and atrophy inupper extremity muscle groups. Sensory loss may accompany the motor deficits,but is generally a less notable clinical feature. The neuritis, or plexopathy,may be present on the same side as or the opposite side of the injection; it issometimes bilateral, affecting both upper extremities.(ii) Weakness is required before the diagnosis can be made. Motor, sensory, andreflex findings on physical examination and the results of nerve conduction andelectromyographic studies must be consistent in confirming that dysfunction isattributable to the brachial plexus. The condition should thereby bedistinguishable from conditions that may give rise to dysfunction of nerve roots(i.e., radiculopathies) and peripheral nerves (i.e., including multiplemonoeuropathies), as well as other peripheral and central nervous systemstructures (e.g., cranial neuropathies and myelopathies).(8) Thrombocytopenic purpura. This term is defined by a serum platelet countless than 50,000/mm3. Thrombocytopenic purpura does not include cases ofthrombocytopenia associated with other causes such as hypersplenism, autoimmunedisorders (including alloantibodies from previous transfusions),myelodysplasias, lymphoproliferative disorders, congenital thrombocytopenia, orhemolytic uremic syndrome. This does not include cases of immune (formerlycalled idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) that are mediated, forexample, by viral or fungal infections, toxins, or drugs. Thrombocytopenicpurpura does not include cases of thrombocytopenia associated with disseminatedintravascular coagulation, as observed with bacterial and viral infections.Viral infections include, for example, those infections secondary toEpstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis A and B, rhinovirus, humanimmunodeficiency virus (HIV), adenovirus, and dengue virus. An antecedent viralinfection may be demonstrated by clinical signs and symptoms and need not beconfirmed by culture or serologic testing. Bone marrow examination, ifperformed, must reveal a normal or an increased number of megakaryocytes in anotherwise normal marrow.(9) Vaccine-strain measles viral infection. This term is defined as a diseasecaused by the vaccine-strain that should be determined by vaccine-specificmonoclonal antibody or polymerase chain reaction tests.(10) Vaccine-strain polio viral infection. This term is defined as a diseasecaused by poliovirus that is isolated from the affected tissue and should bedetermined to be the vaccine-strain by oligonucleotide or polymerase chainreaction. Isolation of poliovirus from the stool is not sufficient to establisha tissue specific infection or disease caused by vaccine-strain poliovirus.(c) Coverage provisions. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2), (3), (4),(5), (6), or (7) of this section, the revised table of injuries set forth inparagraph (a) of this section and the qualifications and aids to interpretationset forth in paragraph (b) of this section apply to petitions for compensationunder the program filed with the US Court of Federal Claims on or after March24, 1997. Petitions for compensation filed before such date shall be governed bysection 2114(a) and (b) of the Public Health Service Act as in effect on January1, 1995, or by §100.3 as in effect on March 10, 1995 (see 60 FR 7678, et seq.,February 8, 1995), as applicable.(2) Hepatitis B, Hib, and varicella vaccines (items VIII, IX, and X of thetable) are included in the table as of August 6, 1997.(3) Rotavirus vaccines (item XI of the table) are included in the table as ofOctober 22, 1998.(4) Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (item XII of the table) are included in thetable as of December 18, 1999.(5) Hepatitis A vaccines (item XIII of the table) are included on the table asof December 1, 2004.(6) Trivalent influenza vaccines (item XIV of the table) are included on thetable as of July 1, 2005.(7) Meningococcal vaccines and human papillomavirus vaccines (items XV and XVIof the table) are included on the table as of February 1, 2007.(8) Other new vaccines (item XVII of the table) will be included in the table asof the effective date of a tax enacted to provide funds for compensation paidwith respect to such vaccines. An amendment to this section will be published inthe Federal Register to announce the effective date of such a tax."},{"pageContent":"THE NATIONAL CHILDHOOD VACCINE SAFETY ACT42 USC CHAPTER 6A - PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE TITLE 42 - THE PUBLIC HEALTH ANDWELFARE CHAPTER 6A - PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE SUBCHAPTER XIX - VACCINESPART 2 - NATIONAL VACCINE INJURY COMPENSATION PROGRAMTable of ContentsSUBPART A - PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS300aa-10.
