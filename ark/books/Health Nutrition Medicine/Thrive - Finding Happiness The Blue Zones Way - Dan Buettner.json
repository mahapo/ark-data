PHOTO BY GIANLUCA COLLAPREFACESearching for HappinessIt’s ten o’clock on a Sunday morning in Hojancha, a small town in rural CostaRica, and I’m on a mission. A few years ago, I met a woman here, the daughter ofa Cuban revolutionary, who raised four children by herself on the edge of thejungle. Her name was Panchita, and when I first got to know her she had justcelebrated her 99th birthday. Wearing a colorful dress, carnival beads, andhooped earrings, she would sit on a wooden plank on the patio of her tin-roofedhouse, dangle her legs above the dirt floor, and tell stories with friends andrelatives who came to visit. She punctuated her conversations with a gentletouch and, depending on the topic, a sympathetic sigh or a whooping laugh. Atsunset, once her guests had departed, she would make herself a simple meal ofbeans and handmade tortillas, say her prayers, and go to bed.Recently I heard that Panchita had a medical setback and moved out of herfarmhouse into a one-room shack behind her son’s place. I’m on my way to see hernow.A modest community of cinder-block houses, shops, and stables, Hojancha ispopulated mainly by farmers and sabaneros, the leathery-tough cowboys of CentralAmerica. Set apart from the rest of Costa Rica on the Nicoya Peninsula, peoplehere have been left to themselves to follow the rhythms of their Mesoamericanancestors. Something about their lifestyle—perhaps the lime-soaked corntortillas called nixta-male, the wildly exotic fruits they grow in theirgardens, the off-the-charts levels of calcium and magnesium in their tap water,their ability to shed stress with laughter and conversation, or even theirpenchant for extramarital sex—has given people in this region the extraordinarygift of long life. In fact, the Nicoya Peninsula represents one of the mostimpressive pockets of longevity in the entire Western Hemisphere—a Blue Zone, asI’ve come to call such places. For the past eight years I’ve been studying theworld’s longevity Blue Zones. I’ve met more than 250 centenarians on fivecontinents, some of whom still work as lawyers, stand on their heads, climbtrees, or compete in karate matches.Yet few have charmed me like Panchita.When I arrive at her shack on this Sunday morning, the place is packed. A priesthas come to say Catholic Mass, and others have stopped by to socialize,including middle-aged women from town, an 80-year-old cowboy, and a boy who usedto corral Panchita’s chickens for her when she lived alone. Sitting upright onher bed, she looks up at me through milky-rimmed pupils and, in a flash ofrecognition, yelps, “¡Hola, Papi!” She wraps me in a bony embrace and holds on.As I hug her back, feeling her warm, birdlike body, I realize that when thisbody was born, Mark Twain was still writing fiction, and construction had notyet begun on the Titanic. Positively beaming, she pulls me down next to her.“See, God has blessed me!” she brags to her guests. “El Gringo has come to visitme.” And I’m thinking: Here’s a 103-year-old woman who has no money and no realpossessions, is living in a borrowed house, is half paralyzed and mostly blind,and she feels blessed that I’ve shown up? How is that possible?LEARNING FROM THE EXPERTSIt’s an eye-opening experience. During my years of studying longevity, I’vevisited Blue Zones in Sardinia; Okinawa; Loma Linda, California; the Greekisland of Ikaría; and the Nicoya Peninsula—all places where people tend tosuffer lower rates of heart disease and cancer than the rest of us and live upto a decade longer. Now I’m wondering if there might also be pockets of peoplelike Panchita who hold the secrets to a happier life. Are there places aroundthe globe that nurture happiness in the same way that the Blue Zones nurturelongevity? If there are, what can we learn from these places to increase our ownhappiness in the same way that we’ve learned lessons about long life from theworld’s centenarians?As I began to pursue this idea, I quickly discovered that an explosion ofresearch in happiness studies has taken place during the past few decades.Social scientists, for example, have gathered a critical mass of data fromthousands of worldwide surveys that not only pinpoint which nations experiencethe highest level of happiness and life satisfaction, but also begin to explainwhy—and some of the reasons aren’t what you’d expect. In places where women haveachieved gender equality, for instance, men tend to be happier than women. Andin places where women are still not treated equally, women are often happierthan men. Other studies have shown that, despite the popular belief that nobodywants to get older, most people actually get happier after a certain age.Clearly, the truth about happiness holds many surprises.In fact, the deeper I dig into the research, the more apparent it becomes thathappiness is a more complicated concept than longevity. Determining whether aperson is 99 or 100 years old is a fairly straightforward task. But how do youmeasure how happy someone is? And what do we mean by happiness? Isn’t happinessdifferent for every person? How likely is it that even the world’s top expertscan come up with a neat prescription to help others become happier?In the face of such challenges, it might be easy to dismiss happiness as anotion that’s too elusive to pin down. But having seen with my own eyes howPanchita and others like her have metabolized a lifetime of hardship into theirown brand of joy, I’m more convinced than ever that the true sources ofhappiness can’t be revealed by scientific studies alone. We also need toconsider the experiences of the happiness experts themselves—people who puttheory into practice every day in pockets of well-being around the world.THE WORLD’S HAPPIEST PLACESIn the pages that follow we’ll visit four of the places identified byresearchers as world leaders in happiness. The first is Denmark’s JutlandPeninsula, where we’ll meet some of the world’s happiness all-stars. Next we’llgo to the island nation of Singapore, whose citizens rank highest in Asia forhappiness, despite living under the heavy hand of an authoritarian government.After that, we’ll visit the Mexican state of Nuevo León, where people reportbeing significantly happier than their much richer neighbors to the north. Andfinally we’ll take a short trip to the town of San Luis Obispo in California tosee how an American community has cooked up its own recipe for satisfaction inlife.As we explore each pocket where people are thriving in different ways, we’ll seehow culture, geography, and government policies combine to stack the deck infavor of happiness. Which types of governments yield the greatest happinessdividends for citizens? Which cultural values foster the greatest degree of lifesatisfaction? What role does religion play? How about money? What’s the optimalmix of communal tradition and individual choice? What can the world’s happiestpeoples tell us about what makes a difference in their lives?To find out, we’ll start by plumbing the most comprehensive scientificdatabases—tens of millions of data points collected over the past 70 years andrepresenting 95 percent of the world’s population—to identify which beliefs,traditions, habits, and physical environments correlate most closely tohappiness. In other words, which factors accompany happiness? Then we’ll sitdown with social scientists, economists, writers, demographers, physiologists,anthropologists, politicians, and even comedians to piece together the uniquehappiness formulas in each location. We’ll get to know a real estate tycoon, ahomemaker, a lawyer, a teacher, a prime minister, a businesswoman, a winemaker,a faith healer, a talk-show host, and a garbage man. All have stories thatcontribute to the bigger picture of happiness in their regions. Finally,informed by the latest scientific research, we’ll distill the commondenominators of satisfaction from each place to show you how to set up your ownlife to maximize happiness.When I first set out to learn the secrets of long life, I discovered that thebest way to do that was to identify the places where people lived the longestand then to study those places methodically, while making a special effort toabsorb the wisdom of individuals who had lived long lives. I think the story ofhappiness is much the same. The best way to understand happiness is to focus onthe remarkable people who rank themselves as very happy (at least an 8 on ascale of 10) and who also believe that they will be happier in the next fiveyears—an optimistic condition that researchers describe as thriving.As we’ll see, the secret to achieving happiness in your own life lies in makingsubtle changes in your surroundings to create gentle but ever present nudges.This book will show you how. Think of it as a manual on how to set up your lifeso you can thrive in the same way that Panchita has—without really trying."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONETHE TRUTH ABOUT HAPPINESSimage [Images/16.jpg]What makes people happy? For many it’s belonging to a club or social group, as90 percent of Danes do. Rasmus Bjerner trains his champion rabbit outside Århus,Denmark, to compete at his local Rabbit Jumping Association. PHOTO BY DAVIDMCLAIN/AURORAThe Truth About HappinessBefore we dig deeper into the nature of happiness, I’d like you to take a shortquiz. I’m going to introduce you to three people I met during my travels, and Iwant you to tell me which one you think is happiest.The first is Jan Hammer, a 42-year-old father of three girls who lives in Århus,the second largest city in Denmark. Each morning at three o’clock, his alarmclock rings, and he rolls out of the warm bed he shares with his wife of 15years. He eats two fried eggs and toast, washes it down with a mug of coffee,and slips into a blaze orange jumpsuit. By four o’clock he’s at the wheel of ahigh-tech garbage truck and is staring at a NASA-like dashboard with flashingbuttons and multiple-view video screens. At each of 59 stops he jumps out of thecab and, with marmot-like zeal, trots from Dumpster to Dumpster and heaves freshrefuse into the hopper with the help of a hydraulic lift. “I don’t even smell itanymore,” he huffs, sweat seeping through his jumpsuit.The second person is Norridah Yusoh, a 43-year-old housewife who lives with herhusband and three school-age children in an apartment in Singapore. Each morningshe dutifully puts on a head scarf, covering her hair as her religion requires;makes her children breakfast; prepares lunch for her husband, an accountant; andsends her family off for the day. After they’re gone, she does household choresand, at midday, she might walk to a nearby food market, to buy food from variousvendors and stop to chat along the way. Some nights after dinner, she goes tothe local McDonald’s, where she socializes with other Muslim mothers as herchildren nibble french fries and do homework. Then, each night before bed, astradition dictates, she kisses her husband’s hand to show respect.The third person is Manuel Uribe, a 45-year-old Mexican man who lives in aworking-class neighborhood of Monterrey. Manuel has a knack for trading, asoothing facility for conversation, and a sincere compassion. He’s also a bigman. In fact, a combination of bad genes and a taste for junk food has balloonedhis weight to the point where he’s confined to a bed in the living room of hismother’s house. This doesn’t impede visitors. On any given day, his room isabuzz with people seeking to cut a deal, to get advice, or just to experience adollop of Manuel’s charm. At noon, Manuel’s mother brings out his lunch—a leanfilet of meat and a generous helping of steamed broccoli. “It’s from the ZoneDiet,” he says. “I’ve lost 200 pounds in the last year.” Just then the dooropens. Claudia Solis, a 30-something secretary, walks in on high heels. She putsa knee on the bed, cranes her lovely neck, and plants a pink-frosted kiss onManuel’s lips.So what’s the answer to the quiz? Which of these three people is the happiest?You’ve probably already guessed the answer: All three of them are happy—sohappy, in fact, that, according to the latest research, they are almostcertainly three of the happiest people in three of the happiest places on theplanet.How can that be?Let’s go back to the garbageman. I met Jan at six o’clock on a gray morning inthe alley behind my hotel in Århus. He was emptying Dumpsters into his behemothgarbage truck. He greeted me heartily, and I could instantly tell that he was anice guy. Pulling off a dirty cotton glove, he offered me his plump hand, whichemitted the sweet-sour smell of his profession.Later, seated in his cab, Jan punched the accelerator, and we sped through themisty Danish dawn. “You can’t find a better job than delivering garbage,” hewhispered conspiratorially. “I work only 21 hours a week and make $80,000 ayear. I drive a Mercedes and take my family to Greece each year.” I looked overat him. He was wearing red square-rimmed glasses, Nike running shoes, and abracelet that read “World’s Most Beautiful Garbage Man.” By eight o’clock he’dbe done with his route and back at the garbage truck depot, he said. After ashower, he’d hit the gym and spa provided by his workers’ union. Some days, hemight go to a second job where he worked as a freelance bricklayer. There hewould make another $60,000 a year.More important than the money, though, was the satisfaction he felt with hislife. “I’m like the yolk of the egg!” he said, using a Danish expression for“fat and happy.” In his community, there was no stigma attached to the “garbagedelivery” business. On weekends, he’d socialize with the dentists and lawyerswho lived on his block. Home by three o’clock every afternoon, he had time tohelp his three daughters with their homework. Three nights a week he’d go to alocal gym, where he’d put on shorts, sneakers, a red sports shirt, and a whistleto coach his daughters’ indoor soccer team. His life was rewarding and full.As for Norridah, listen to what she said when I asked her to rate her happinesson a scale of 1 to 10: “I’m a 9.5! I have a lot of friends from a wide varietyof backgrounds.” This was important for her, living in Singapore, because thegovernment there strongly encourages harmony among the nation’s three majorethnic groups: Chinese, Indians, and Malays such as Norridah. “Ever since myschool days, I’ve mixed with Chinese and Indians and learned how to make friendswith all of them,” she said. “Maybe I talk most with my Malay friends on thephone, but when I go out—which I do every day—I meet my Indian friends at themarket or play cards with Chinese friends. My children are the same way. Theydon’t see color or race, they see people.”“How about your tudong?” I asked, using the Malay word for a head scarf. “Youlive in this modern city, your husband is an accountant, your kids listen toiPods. Your scarf seems so traditional. Do you feel you’re free to take if offand show your hair, if you want?”“That is my own choice,” she said, gently passing her hand over the scarf. “It’spart of our religion, and it is the way of our leaders. I choose to wear it. Mydaughter’s generation might have different ideas. But it makes me comfortable,so I wear it.”“And how about this custom of kissing your husband’s hand?” I asked.“This is a form of respecting each other,” she said. “It’s part of being a goodMuslim. Doing it every day makes sure you’re purged of guilt and grudges. I doit from the bottom of my heart, not that I have necessarily done anything wrong.It’s just a show of respect. My husband reciprocates, but in his own way.”And Manuel? What was the source of his happiness? Here’s what he told me:“When I was younger, I saw an ad for an electronics company in Texas looking fortechnicians who could speak English,” he said. “But by the time I was 35, I’dlost my savings, my auto parts business, and my wife,” he said. “I bought a gunand kept it in my bed, thinking I might use it on myself. Then one night Godcame to me and told me I had work to do.” Manuel went on a diet and started tolose weight. With his mother’s consent, he had a hole punched through hisbedroom wall, installed double-wide glass doors to admit the world, andunleashed his knack for deal making. Today he receives up to 70 visitors aday—clients seeking to trade everything from blue jeans to Thompson helicopters,cousins and friends stopping by for a chat, or people seeking his businessadvice. He doesn’t have to go looking for social interaction; it comes to him.As I sat with him one evening, his cell phone rang and he lifted the tiny deviceto his ear. On the other end, a desperately overweight girl was searching forhope. “If I can turn my life around,” he said tenderly, “you can too, dear.”When he hung up, an old friend stopped by for a visit. Then another phone call.This time it was news that the website Manuel runs had crashed. In his smooth,unflappable voice, he troubleshot the problem with the webmaster. I sat back andwatched. “Does this ever end?” I asked.“If it did, I’d be dead,” he said.A year later, Manuel married Claudia. With her help, he has lost more than 500pounds. Life has never been better.These three individuals—a garbageman with time for his kids, a housewifesurrounded by close friends, and a junk dealer on a personal mission offaith—share a common characteristic: They all consider themselves to be “veryhappy.” More than that, they all believe that they will become even happier inthe years to come. Like many people, they deal with challenges every day. Theyexperience stress, periods of sadness, and grief. Life sometimes deals them abad hand. They are, in many ways, not so different from the rest of us. Yetsomehow they experience a sense of happiness greater than ours. Researchers havea term for this positive, optimistic condition: They call such people thrivers.Thriving--------------------------------------------------------------------------------According to the Gallup organization, “thriving” countries are those whosecitizens think positively about their lives and report more happiness,enjoyment, interest, and respect. These countries also report significantlylower rates of health problems, sick days, stress, sadness, and anger.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------What’s their secret?During the past few decades, a small army of psychologists, social scientists,and scholars have asked the same question. Through rigorous experimentation andexhaustive surveys, they’ve given birth to a new science of happiness, focusingnot only on defining the nature of human happiness, but also on discovering waysto improve our chances for personal well-being. Before we strike off around theworld to learn the lessons of the world’s happiness people, let’s turn to someof the leading experts to understand the scientific fundamentals of the field: Ed Diener, Ph.D., is Joseph R. Smiley Distinguished Professor of Psychology atthe University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and the author of Happiness:Unlocking the Mysteries of Psychological Wealth. Sonja Lyubomirsky, Ph.D., is a professor of psychology at the University ofCalifornia, Riverside, and the author of The How of Happiness: A ScientificApproach to Getting the Life You Want.Ruut Veenhoven, Ph.D., is director of the World Database of Happiness and editorof the Journal of Happiness Studies. Jim Harter, Ph.D., is chief scientist of workplace management and well-being forGallup and coauthor of 12: The Elements of Great Managing and Wellbeing: TheFive Essential Elements. Bruno S. Frey is a professor of economics at the University of Zurich andresearch director of CREMA (Center for Research in Economics, Management and theArts). He is the author of Happiness: A Revolution in Economics. Mihály Csíkszentmihályi is Distinguished Professor of Psychology and director ofthe Quality of Life Research Center at the Claremont Graduate University inClaremont, California. In what follows, I’ve distilled ideas from their books as well as from myinterviews with these experts and sorted their answers according to keyquestions. Here’s what they told me.WHAT IS HAPPINESS?Mihály Csíkszentmihályi: As many a thinker since Aristotle has said, everythingwe do is ultimately aimed at experiencing happiness. We don’t really wantwealth, or health, or fame as such—we want these things because we hope theywill make us happy. But happiness we seek not because it will get us somethingelse, but for its own sake.Sonja Lyubomirsky: I use the term “happiness” to refer to the experience of joy,contentment, or positive well-being, combined with a sense that one’s life isgood, meaningful, and worthwhile. However, most of us don’t need a definition ofhappiness because we instinctively know whether we are happy or not. Ed Diener: The word “happiness” means many things. It means positive emotions.It means life satisfaction. It means generally your life is going well. It meansmany different things in the different ways people use it. Everyone has thisgeneral idea. So I don’t define happiness. I try to use these other, more exactterms, such as positive emotions, life satisfaction, marital satisfaction.HOW DO YOU MEASURE HAPPINESS?Sonja Lyubomirsky: We let people define happiness for themselves. There’s nohappiness thermometer. No one else can tell you how happy you are. It’s asubjective phenomenon. No one but you knows, or should tell you, how happy youtruly are. Jim Harter: We ask people to rate the quality of their overall life today on a0-10 ladder of life developed by Hadley Cantril of Princeton, and what theythink it will be in the next five years—to tap into their “reflecting” self. Thegood news is that most people have a more positive view of the future than thepresent…maybe this keeps us striving for something better. We use responses toquestions to categorize people as “thriving,” “struggling,” or “suffering.” Wealso ask people to recall their experiences from the previous day. This allowsus to tap into the “experiencing” self or how much positive and negativeemotions and experiences people have on a typical day. These are both importantaspects of well-being…the evaluating self and the experiencing self. Ruut Veenhoven: In my definition, happiness is how much one likes the life onelives. So if people say they are happy they are happy, unless they are lying. Ed Diener: The key is that each person is making the evaluation of his or herlife—not an expert’s, philosopher’s, or somebody else. Thus, the person herselfor himself is the expert: Is my life going well, according to the standards thatI choose to use?DO THE SAME THINGS MAKE EVERYONE HAPPY?Sonja Lyubomirsky: There are many faces of happiness. The face of happiness maybe someone who is intensely curious and enthusiastic about learning; it may besomeone who is engrossed in plans for his next five years; it may be someone whocan distinguish between the things that matter and the things that don’t; it maybe someone who looks forward each night to reading to her child. Some happypeople may look outwardly cheerful or transparently serene, and others aresimply busy. In other words, we all have the potential to be happy, each in ourown way.Ed Diener: Some things about happiness are universal. If everyone hates you,nobody respects you or supports you, that makes you unhappy, no matter who youare. But other things are unique. They depend on your personality. For example,I love analyzing data. Most people don’t. They’d rather read a book, see amovie, or gossip. The evidence is strong that social relationships are now abasic need. The other things we talk about in terms of happiness are a littlemore abstract, like making progress toward your goals and values, and havingpurpose and meaning.DO WE HAVE ANY CONTROL OVER OUR HAPPINESS?Sonja Lyubomirsky: On average, 50 percent of individual differences in happinessis influenced by our genetic makeup, 10 percent is influenced by our lifecircumstances, and 40 percent is influenced by how we think and act every day.Research has shown that each of us is born with a kind of happiness “set point,”a natural predisposition for happiness that we carry throughout our lives. Butthat doesn’t mean your happiness level cannot be changed. We can rise above ourhappiness set points, just as we can rise above our set points for weight orcholesterol. Genuinely happy people do not just sit around being content. Theymake things happen. They pursue new understandings, seek new achievements, andcontrol their thoughts and feelings. We can also learn from others. If anunhappy person wants to experience interest, enthusiasm, contentment, peace, andjoy, he or she can make it happen by learning the habits of a happy person.WHAT ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO HAPPINESS?Sonja Lyubomirsky: We tend to look for happiness in the wrong places. What webelieve would make a huge difference in our lives actually, according toscientific research, makes only a small difference, while we overlook the truesources of personal happiness and well-being. Many of us think that moving intoa bigger house, securing a promotion or pay raise, or flying first class willboost our happiness. But such pleasures are fleeting, leaving us no happier thanwe were before. The true keys to happiness lie in changing the way we think andbehave, seeking out experiences such as savoring a beautiful moment and taking apicture of it, thanking a friend, writing a gratitude journal, or performingrandom acts of kindness. Such habits add up to create an upward spiral thatboosts happiness. Jim Harter: When we considered factors that explain both life evaluations anddaily experiences, we found five areas that individuals can act on: career,social, financial, physical, and community. Career well-being is more than justhaving a job and it is relevant for people in all different life stages andsituations…students, people who work in the home, people who are retired,self-subsistence farmers, and people in traditional work settings. It’s reallywhat you do with your life, how you spend your time, whether it is enjoyable andmeaningful.Ed Diener: Here’s what I would say to an auditorium of average people from Iowa(or wherever), if they asked me how to increase one’s happiness: We can’tcontrol our genes, so why worry about that? We can control our behavior and ourthinking, so that’s what we focus on. It’s not a scientific argument. It’s apractical argument. Some of the most powerful things we can do involve ourrelationships with others. Mihály Csíkszentmihályi: If one wants to improve the quality of everyday life,happiness may be the wrong place to start. Other feelings are much moreinfluenced by what one does, who one is with, or the place one happens to be.These moods are more amenable to direct change, and because they are alsoconnected to how happy we feel, in the long run they might lift our averagelevel of happiness. For instance, how active, strong, and alert we feel dependsa lot on what we do—these feelings become more intense when we are involved witha difficult task, and they get more attenuated when we fail at what we do, orwhen we don’t try to do anything. The quality of life does not depend onhappiness alone, but also on what one does to be happy. If one fails to developgoals that give meaning to one’s existence, if one does not use the mind to itsfullest, then good feelings fulfill just a fraction of the potential we possess.True happiness involves the pursuit of worthy goals. Without dreams, withoutrisks, only a trivial semblance of living can be achieved.CAN MONEY BUY HAPPINESS?Sonja Lyubomirsky: The truth is that money does make us happy. But ourmisunderstanding, as one happiness researcher eloquently explains, is that “wethink money will bring lots of happiness for a long time, and actually it bringsa little happiness for a short time.” Being wealthy has its advantages, ofcourse. But it doesn’t make us dramatically happier, she explains. The richestAmericans, those earning more than ten million dollars annually, report levelsof personal happiness only slightly greater than the office staffs andblue-collar workers they employ. The reason may be that wealthy people arepreoccupied with staying wealthy. Meanwhile, in our effortful pursuit of suchdead ends to pleasure, we end up ignoring other, more effective routes towell-being. Ed Diener: Yes, money buys happiness, but there are important exceptions. Moneyis more than a fixed amount of legal tender. Wealth is, in part, also about yourdesires. Being satisfied with your paycheck, just like being satisfied with yourlife, is about your point of view. Studies have shown that an individual’sincome is a poor predictor of their happiness. Some people with a lot of moneycould not meet their desires, and others with little money were able to do so.Materialistic people, that is, are seldom the happiest people because they wanttoo much. It is generally good for your happiness to have money, but toxic toyour happiness to want money too much.Bruno Frey: People make a mistake when it comes to predicting how much moneywill make them happy. Consider the individual who chooses a job with more incomebut a longer commute. If you get an increase in income, two-thirds tothree-quarters of the happiness from that increase wears out in one year,because you get accustomed to a higher income level very quickly. But you neverget used to a long commute. Mihály Csíkszentmihályi: Material well-being is attractive and relatively easyto attain, but there’s a point of diminishing returns. Kids that value materialgoals beyond a certain point end up not having many friends. They become selfishand more depressed. You can’t pile up more things and expect an increase inwell-being. The same thing holds true for society in general. There is only avery weak relationship between finances and satisfaction with life; billionairesin America are only infinitesimally happier than those with average incomes. Oneconclusion that the findings seem to justify is that beyond the threshold ofpoverty, additional resources do not appreciably improve the chances of beinghappy.IS HAPPINESS CONTAGIOUS?Sonja Lyubomirsky: Surrounding yourself with people who are happy is going tomake you happier. Conversely, if you’re married to a negative person, it’s goingto take a toll on you. The problem is that we adapt: We really have to work toappreciate what we have.Ed Diener: It’s certainly true that if you’re around somebody that’s giving youmany compliments, you start giving people compliments yourself. If you’re aroundpeople who are more positive in general, you get more positive. On the otherhand, when you’re unhappy and you’re bitching all the time, you’re not justaffecting yourself, you’re affecting other people, too, and you’re also teachingthem about how to act or not act.IS HAPPINESS OVERRATED?Ed Diener: We actually think it’s underrated, rather than overrated. We thinkthe reason everybody wants to be happy is because it’s pleasant. It just feelsgood. We’re saying, it’s not just that. If you’re happy, you function better.You’re more sociable. You’re a better citizen. You do volunteer work. You’rehealthier. All these things. Conversely, if you look at really unhappy people,angry and depressed people, they don’t normally function well. Angry people aredisruptive in group work. Depressed people, they’re withdrawn, they have noenergy. Nothing sounds good to them.Unhappy Places--------------------------------------------------------------------------------According to World Values Surveys from 1995 to 2007, the 10 unhappiest places onEarth are:1. Zimbabwe, 2. Armenia, 3. Moldova, 4. Belarus, 5. Ukraine, 6. Albania, 7.Iraq, 8. Bulgaria, 9. Georgia, 10. Russia.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sonja Lyubomirsky: A recent review of all the available literature has revealedthat happiness does indeed have numerous positive by-products, which appear tobenefit not only individuals, but families, communities, and the society atlarge. The benefits of happiness include higher income and superior workoutcomes (e.g., greater productivity and higher quality of work); larger socialrewards (e.g., more satisfying and longer marriages, more friends, strongersocial support, and richer social interactions); more activity, energy, andflow; better physical health (e.g., a bolstered immune system, lowered stresslevels, and less pain); and even longer life. The literature, my colleagues andI have found, also suggests that happy individuals are more creative, helpful,charitable, and self-confident; have better self-control; and show greaterself-regulatory and coping abilities.HAPPINESS BLUE ZONESHow can you benefit from the insights of these researchers and thrive in yourdaily life? The answer goes back to the quiz you took at the beginning of thischapter. As the stories about the garbageman, housewife, and bedriddenwheeler-dealer demonstrate, happiness comes in many shapes and sizes. Althoughwe might think we know what we need to be happy, such as physical beauty,financial success, or the recognition of our peers, the scientific evidencepoints in a different direction. The true sources of happiness, the experts say,are deeper patterns of behavior and thinking in our lives—patterns that we canadjust if we just put our minds to it.Fortunately, we don’t have to start this process of change from scratch. Aswe’ll see in the chapters that follow, scientists have already identified placesaround the world where people today are experiencing levels of happiness andwell-being that are probably higher than yours or mine. All we have to do isfigure out how they do it, and then adapt their lessons to fit our lives.In pursuit of this quest, the National Geographic Society sent me around theworld to visit four of the happiest regions on three continents to see if Icould find common denominators—a common recipe for human happiness. In eachplace I talked to writers, economists, social scientists, demographers,physiologists, anthropologists, a prime minister, and ordinary people to piecetogether the local formula for happiness. I examined which government policiesseemed to yield the greatest well-being, which cultural norms encouraged themost happiness, and which personal habits and environmental factors favored thegreatest life satisfaction. I used a science-based approach to probe the onesure source of knowledge about happiness: the people who are verifiablyexperiencing it. In the chapters that follow, you may be surprised by whatpeople told me. You might find their stories of happiness hard to believe,especially when they spring from conditions that are difficult or challenging.But in the end I think you’ll discover that these stories will reveal new waysof thinking, and that the lessons they offer can help you get more joy out ofeach day—and ultimately set up your life so that true, authentic, and lastinghappiness can ensue.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Measuring HappinessA number of polls measure happiness on a world scale. Here are a few of the mostsignificant polls and what they address:World Database of HappinessStarted in 1984, this collection of thousands of scientific research reports onhappiness from around the world, compiled by Ruut Veenhoven at ErasmusUniversity in Rotterdam, examines the subjective enjoyment of life, includingfeelings correlated with happiness, and how nations around the world comparewith one another in terms of happiness levels.World Values SurveyThis worldwide network of social scientists has conducted surveys in 97 nationssince 1981. Conducted in five waves, in collaboration with the European ValuesStudy, the surveys assess the impact of changing values on social and politicallife. Gallup World Poll—This poll, which synthesizes survey information from 155countries, uses Gallup’s global information gathering resources to identify thestrengths and challenges faced by different countries and regions. Subjects wereasked questions about economic conditions, government and business, health careand well-being, infrastructure and education, and life satisfaction. Latinobarómetro—This public opinion survey is conducted annually in 18 LatinAmerican countries with more than 400 million people and measures publicopinion, attitudes, and behaviors on topics including trade, democracy, trust ininstitutions, and other topical issues pertaining to Latin American countries. Eurobarometer—Conducted by the Public Opinion Analysis sector of the EuropeanCommission, the Eurobarometer has measured public perception of quality of lifein various European cities.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWODENMARK:The World’s Happiness All-Starsimage [Images/38.jpg]Kenneth and Lene Zibrandtsen play cards with their daughter, Astrid, on acandlelit evening in Copenhagen, embodying the Danish concept of hygge —“the artof relaxing in a warm and cozy environment.” PHOTO BY DAVID MCLAIN/AURORADenmark:The World’s Happiness All-StarsYou can almost always learn something about a city by turning your nose skywardand taking in a breath. I’ll never forget my first whiff of the diesel fumes inLima, Peru. Or Seoul’s relentless garlic breath. Or the aroma of cloves in Lamu,Kenya. Or the smell of human sweat in Lagos, Nigeria. But my first impression ofCopenhagen was a puzzle. As far as I could tell, this city of more than amillion people had no odor at all—or at most a hint of salt water from thenearby Baltic Sea.“We try very hard to smell of nothing,” my friend Anders Weber explained. “Noone wants to stand out.”It was a warm afternoon, and the two of us were pedaling side by side downCopenhagen’s cobblestone streets. Anders, a 29-year-old journalist, had alertblue eyes, fuzzy blond hair, and a pale complexion. On most mornings, hisbaritone voice could be heard on one of Denmark’s most popular radio newsprograms, which he helped to produce. Lately, after work, he’d been acting as myguide, showing me around the city and helping to set up interviews.We’d ditched our rental car the day before in favor of a pair of MaryPoppins-esque bicycles that now had become our research vehicles. My plan was tomeet the people of Copenhagen up close and perhaps to witness some of Denmark’sfabled happiness. As one study after another has shown, the people of this smallScandinavian nation consistently report levels of happiness and well-being nearthe very top of the scale, making them some of the world’s happiness all-stars.What is it about their way of life that generates these positive feelings? Andhow is their sense of happiness different from those of people in other parts ofthe world? What is the Danish formula for happiness?Along with a third of the population in Copenhagen, Anders can bike practicallyanywhere he needs to go. Here, unlike most parts of the world, bicyclists occupythe top of the food chain. Wide, double bike lanes, right-of-way priority, ahealthy disdain for pollution, and a 900-year-old street grid designed for foottraffic give two-wheelers in the city a pronounced advantage over theirfour-wheeled counterparts. Bicyclists cruise side by side and holdconversations. Slow traffic stays to the right, while the Lycra-clad set whizzesby in the left lane. You see people chatting on their cell phones while riding.In fact, cycling here has achieved not only acceptance, but also a kind ofhipness. Men on bikes wear suits and ties and carry their briefcases inhigh-fashion handlebar baskets. Women pedal in skirts and high heels. Becausecycling is cool and easy, people here don’t mind doing it. In fact, commuters inCopenhagen cycle more than a million kilometers per day, a routine that helpsexplain why Danes tend to be trimmer than their English, German, and Swedishneighbors.As we pedaled through the waterfront Nyhavn district, Anders and I followed theroutes of historic canals, flanked on one side by café-lined streets and on theother by buildings painted crimson, baby blue, and gold. Farther on, crossingthe town square, we saw street vendors selling smoked herring (instead of snowcones and wieners like we have in Minnesota) from wagons on the zigzag brickpavement. In the heart of the city, we rumbled over centuries-old cobblestoneson streets with gargling names like Lille Kirkestræde or Snaregade. Then, as weleft the older part of town, we saw modern Danish architecture come to life inplaces like the Sluseholmen housing development, whose blocky white buildingsclearly were designed by an architect who had been obsessed with Legos as a kid,and the city’s concert hall, which lights up at night like an iridescent cobaltblue cube.Denmark Facts--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Region: Northern EuropeLocation: On a peninsula north of Germany bordered by the Baltic Sea and theNorth SeaPopulation: 5.5 million people--------------------------------------------------------------------------------As a cyclist, I’ve always regarded stoplights as more of a suggestion than acommand—and then only when cross traffic is menacing. Not the Danes. At everycrosswalk we passed, people dutifully waited for the green with their hands attheir sides or buried in their pockets—including cyclists.“Do Danes always do that?” I asked Anders.“Of course,” he replied. “It could be two in the morning, without even the hopeof a passing car, and we’ll wait for the light.”Something else I noticed during our tour: Despite Denmark’s reputation as one ofthe happiest places on Earth, few of the ordinary citizens we passed seemedparticularly cheerful. In fact, most pedestrians in Copenhagen struck me asreserved or even sullen. They kept to themselves as they walked down thestreets. Like people in any big city, they appeared to be in a big hurry, andthey avoided eye contact with those around them. This reminded me of Denmark’sother reputation as a place with long winters, brooding intellectuals, and atroubling suicide rate. An outgoing Dane, as one joke puts it, is the guy wholooks down at your shoes instead of his own. (“I’m shocked to hear we’re a happylot,” a well-known comedian had told me. “Maybe Danes go home and act happy intheir kitchens.”) How did the serious side of their personalities fit into thehappiness formula? Was I reading too much into casual observations? Or was thisdarkness another clue to understanding the Danish character?The contradictions were intriguing. In survey after survey, Danes consistentlyoutpace the rest of the world not only for the way they experience happiness,but also for their tendency to recognize their happiness when asked to evaluatetheir lives. To put it differently, the Danish people authentically thrive. Buthow does that sit with their sometimes gloomy outlook?Questions like these were piling up in my mind as Anders and I ducked downCopenhagen’s narrow streets. On one corner, I caught the eye of afriendly-looking young woman with a bowl haircut and a tie-dye T-shirt, and Iwaved as I rode by. She abruptly looked away.“I wouldn’t do that if I were you,” cautioned Anders, pedaling next to me.“Why not?” I asked.“You’ll stand out,” he said.“Can’t I smile, at least?”“I wouldn’t do that either. It makes people uncomfortable.”“What if I gave them a big smile and waved?”“Well, I don’t know,” Anders said gravely. “They’d probably call the police.”THE FIRST PIECES OF THE PUZZLEAs I was about to discover, getting to the bottom of a place’s formula forhappiness is like piecing together a puzzle. You pick up a fact here, a figurethere, and once enough pieces are in place, the whole picture comes into view.One of the first experts I consulted in Denmark was Peter Gundelach, asociologist from the University of Copenhagen, who recently had administered theEuropean Values Survey in his country. A tall man with rimless glasses and afringe of gray hair on a bald dome, Gundelach welcomed me to his office in a150-year-old gray-brick building at the university. Eager to hear his insights,I starting peppering him with a string of why-are-Danes-so-happy questions. Buthe held up a finger to slow me down.“You must remember,” he said, “I’m not a psychologist. I conduct surveys ofentire populations. I deal in averages.”Here’s how his surveys work, he told me. Researchers start with 1,500 randomlyselected names and addresses from the Danish census bureau. To each person theysend a letter requesting an interview. For statistical purposes, he explained,1,500 names are more than enough to get an accurate picture of Danish attitudes.“Imagine a swimming pool filled with five million black and white marbles,” hesaid. “If you randomly pick 1,500 of them and discover that 39 percent are blackand 61 percent are white, you can safely assume that the same ratio holds truefor the entire pool, give or take a couple of percent.”About half of the recipients responded to the letter and agreed to a one-hourmeeting, during which an interviewer asked 100 or so questions. Only three ofthese questions addressed happiness head-on, and they were all variations of thefollowing: “Taking all things together, would you say you are 1) very happy, 2)quite happy, 3) not very happy, or 4) not at all happy?” The power of thesesurveys, Gundelach said, came not just from each individual’s ranking of his orher level of happiness, but also from how the individual correlated that rankingto other aspects of his or her life. Such data, in the hands of statisticians,revealed which behaviors were most likely to be present in people who reportedbeing happy.Before telling me what his study revealed, though, Gundelach took a moment togive me some perspective. With a population of five and a half million, hereminded me, Denmark is one of the world’s wealthier nations per capita. Danesspend relatively more money on their children and seniors than any other people.Lifelong health care is a Danish birthright. Education is free, and universitystudents are paid to go to school. Doctor visits, x-rays, and surgeries are allcovered by the state. If you have difficulty conceiving a baby, the governmentwill pay for fertility treatments. And while it won’t pay for your breastimplants, it will cover the cleanup costs if the silicone springs a leak. Ifyou’re out of work (which is unlikely—unemployment is around four percent), thegovernment will pay you to look for a job.“Denmark is a high-functioning country,” said Gundelach, summing it up. “It’sstable and safe. Your kids can play on the streets. You have this feeling thatnot very many things can go wrong. But if they do, there is someone to take careof you.”Other Happy Places--------------------------------------------------------------------------------According to Ruut Veenhoven’s World Database of Happiness, the happiestcountries in the world are: 1. Costa Rica, 2. Denmark, 3. Iceland, 4.Switzerland, 5. Finland, 6. Mexico, 7. Norway, 8. Canada, 9. Panama, and 10.Sweden. The United States is ranked 20th in this survey.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------“But then again, you pay for it, don’t you?” I said. Anyone making more than theequivalent of about $70,000 a year will part with 60 percent of it throughtaxes.“Yes, but we see from the surveys that most people here are satisfied with thetrade-off,” Gundelach replied. Although Danes might grumble about high taxes,they approve of the results: a society with an extremely low disparity betweenrich and poor. As a popular slogan puts it, Denmark is a country “where few havetoo much and even fewer have too little.”Turning to the survey results, he said, we now know in some detail what makespeople in Denmark happy. According to his research, the happiest Danes were mostlikely to: * live around people they could trust * live in a city (rather than in the country) * feel like their opinions were heard * live in a place with people of equal status * feel secure * be middle-aged * be married or in a committed relationshipNone of these factors by themselves guarantee happiness, Gundelach was quick topoint out. His research on marriage, for example, suggests that, althoughmarried people were twice as likely to be happy as unmarried people, they werealso more likely to be happy in the first place. But as I looked at his list,the factors seemed to be key building blocks for a happy society. I noticed thatneither wealth nor status was in the mix of top values.“So,” I pressed, “what actually causes happiness here?”“To begin with, no one has ever come up with an elegant definition ofhappiness,” said Gundelach, hedging. “You can always be a little bit more happy,so there is no limit to the term. You can be satisfied—content with thedifference between what you want and what you get.” Then he paused to gather histhoughts. Exuding a patient, Scandinavian goodness, he seemed to sense that hisanswer had veered from my question. “I’m sorry,” he said. “We can only measurewhat people say. It takes a lot of questions, and then a lot of math, to beginto figure out what we really feel and how that connects to happiness.”“So have you figured it out?” I asked.“Well, Denmark is homogenous,” he replied. “We share a common background. Welook similar. We like the same food. We rally around the same flag—which is theoldest one in the world. So when the government asks us to make a sacrifice andpay 70 percent of our salary in taxes, we know it is for someone who is likeus.” He looked over at me and switched gears. “One of the reasons we think Danesare very happy is because they are very satisfied with their lives. Which meansthat life is very good here—or that Danes have very low expectations.”I understood what he meant about low expectations. Ask a Dane how he is, andhe’ll invariably answer “Det kunne være værre”—“It could be worse”—a responsethat clearly doesn’t focus on the wonderful things the day may have in store.But what does that mean for the rest of us? What lesson does it teach aboutachieving happiness in our own lives? It would be hard to imagine telling a WallStreet broker to cultivate low expectations, for example. So I kept on pushing.“Anything else explain Danish happiness?” I asked.“We don’t really know,” he said finally.I shuffled my papers and waited for more. He looked away as the room filled withpalpable unease.“All right, I’ll tell you what I think,” he said at last, and lightly slappedthe desk—a gesture of frustration by a numbers man who is uncomfortable strayingtoo far from a spreadsheet. “I believe a lot of it goes back to the period after1864, after we lost 25 percent of our territory to the Germans in theSchleswig-Holstein War. We had to abandon our ambitions to be a superpower. Thisis when our country began to change. Enlightenment came early here.”By enlightenment, he meant that Danes had learned the wisdom of turning theirresources inward and focusing them on education, social institutions, andnational pride. Gundelach went on to explain that Denmark’s defeat gave rise toa populist educational movement. It was started by a poet, pastor, and hymnwriter named Nikolai Grundtvig, who believed that, since everyone experiencesemotions with equal quality and intensity, everyone is essentially equal.Education, he believed, should focus on asking the question “Who are you?”rather than “What can you do?” (Grundtvig once said, “A doctor may know morethan a peasant, but a peasant and a doctor know more together.”) This visionfound expression in the founding of the Folkehoejskoler, or Danish folk highschools. These schools had no rules or exams—strictures that “deaden the soul,”Grundtvig warned—but offered classes that prepared students for society and forparticipation in the arts. They promoted a spirit of freedom, equality, anddisciplined creativity. The idea—for the first time in human history, Gundelachsaid—was to give peasants and other poor people a chance to appreciate the arts,to enjoy a poem, or to delight in a Mozart sonata.For the next two hours, Gundelach developed this argument and began to tie itmore closely to a national feeling of happiness. He said the folk schoolmovement gave Danes the confidence they needed to rebuild—and the convictionthat everyone needed to have a role in that rebuilding. It taught them tocooperate and to compromise, thus giving Denmark a head start in the practice ofdemocracy. The schools spawned cooperatives, which led to Danish farmprosperity, he said. Among other accomplishments, the cooperatives standardizedbutter (made possible by centrifuges invented in the folk schools) and producedhigh-quality bacon. This emphasis upon consistent quality, a major innovation inthe 19th century, helped to launch Denmark into the high-end economic niche forwhich the nation is still known today.The cooperatives also gave rise to countless associations, which in many wayshave defined Danish social life. Today 95 percent of Danes belong to oneassociation or another—everything from labor unions to clubs for cold-waterswimmers. For a people not known for being outgoing, these institutionalizedsocial networks have been crucial in keeping Danes connected to one another. Andthis has boosted their level of happiness.“But remember,” Gundelach warned, “this is just me talking.”Perhaps, I thought, but he was making good sense. If you look at the results ofall the surveys from 146 countries, you find that people who live in advanceddemocracies with strong social interaction tend to be happiest. But the idea ofdeveloping an individual’s artistic ability as a means to create social harmonycame as a revelation to me—as something uniquely Danish.THE SUICIDE MYTHAs we got deeper into our research, Anders and I developed a daily routine.Every afternoon I’d meet him at his apartment, a small place that looks like VanGogh’s “Bedroom at Arles” with its wood-planked floors, simple furniture, andframed landscapes on the walls. Then, sitting at his wooden table, we’d go overa list of people to interview. My initial conversation with Gundelach hadsparked several interesting ideas in my mind, and I was eager to follow up onthem. For example, I had my doubts about how well Danes accept the 60 percenttax rate. Are they really happy paying two-thirds of their income to thegovernment—no matter how good the services? What does that do to theirmotivation? Do people really work? I also wanted to dig deeper into a few of theunique qualities of Danish culture—the way kids are raised, for one—and howthese qualities relate to Danish happiness. Where does their sense of trust inone another come from? Or their penchant for “being heard”?Pedal Power--------------------------------------------------------------------------------In Copenhagen, one of the happiest cities in the world, 32% of workers bike towork daily. Even in rainy weather, 60% will still cycle, and 66% will continueto ride their bikes during the winter months.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------We decided to pay a visit to Rolf Jensen, who was then executive director of theCopenhagen Institute for Future Studies. A short man of about 60 with a pleasantdisposition and red-rimmed glasses, Jensen had done a lot of thinking about howshifting values change the way we live and do business. His international bestseller, The Dream Society, had correctly predicted that marketers would soonneed to differentiate brands by creating stories about them to explain what theyare and what they stand for (think Patagonia or Whole Foods). By the time weleft Anders’s apartment for our meeting, we were running a little late. Anderscalled ahead to let Jensen know.“I suggest to you that you just relax and get here when you get here,” Jensensaid calmly. I loved his attitude, which reminded me of a Danish workplace studyshowing that, for most people, running late generated more stress than theworkload involved. So Anders and I stopped for a quick lunch and showed up halfan hour late. “I can offer you coffee, water, or a compromise: water andcoffee,” Jensen joked as he greeted us. He didn’t even mention the time.Jensen had taken a close look at the World Values Survey that ranks Denmark nearthe top for happiness, and he’d concluded that the two most important factorsare the nation’s commitments to tolerance and equality. Consider, for example,the way that Danes answered the following survey question: “Do you think thatthere is something good or right about all religions?” In general, Danes saidyes. A second question asked if children should be raised to be good citizens orto be self-reliant. To that question most Danes answered “self-reliant.” Statusseekers are frowned upon in Denmark, Jensen said. “If you ride a taxi, you sitin the front seat. If you buy a new BMW, people will look down on you and wonderif you have some problems with your masculinity.”When I asked him where this tradition of enforced modesty came from, he told mea story. In the 1930s, he said, a Danish-Norwegian writer by the name of AkselSandemose wrote a book called A Fugitive Crosses His Tracks, which describeslife in the fictional small town of Jante. In this town, people live by a set ofinformal rules such as “Don’t think you’re smarter than us” or “Don’t think youcan teach us anything.” The Jante law, as these rules came to be known, capturedthe small-town Scandinavian mentality insisting that no one is better thananyone else. “And if you think you are, you’ll be cut down,” Jensen said.“So how does that contribute to Danish happiness?” I asked. It didn’t seem veryhelpful.“On the contrary,” he said. “The surveys show very clearly that countries wherepeople have roughly the same level of status are happier than those places whereyou have a few haves and many have-nots. In Denmark, we have the Jante lawmentality to thank for that.”When I asked about the long, dark winters in Denmark and the country’s high rateof suicide, he countered that both are overblown. In recent years the nation’sranking for suicides had fallen from number one in the world to number fifteen.“Besides, Danes are a stoic people who report these things accurately,” hepointed out. “If Daddy hangs himself, it’s reported straightforwardly as asuicide. In Italy, if Father hangs himself, it would bring shame on the familyand therefore might be reported as an accidental death.” As for the drearymonths of winter, he acknowledged that darkness lasts as long as 17 hours a dayin Denmark. But Danes compensate for this by creating warm, candlelitenvironments to share with the company of friends. They even have a word forthis, he said: hygge, which translates into a blend of “coziness” and“tranquillity.”THE PROBLEM WITH HARD WORKOur next stop was with Tøger Seidenfaden, editor in chief of Politiken,Copenhagen’s left-leaning daily newspaper. I’d recently seen him on 60 Minutes,on which he discussed cartoons, published in Danish papers, that lampooned theprophet Muhammad. I’d been impressed by his Yale degree and insights into theDanish character. I figured he must have some thoughts about happiness.The newspaper is located in a castle-like brick building overlooking a busydowntown square. As I waited in his corner office, I noticed a stern portrait ofViggo Hørup, the newspaper’s founder, staring down from the wall. Then the doorswung open and in whirled Seidenfaden, wearing a coffee-stained white shirt andleather sandals. A wandering forelock dangled over his forehead from anotherwise thinning head of blond hair.“I didn’t believe you,” he said by way of greeting me as he shook my hand. Hewas referring to a note I’d sent to him about how Danes are some of the world’shappiest people. “But since you contacted me, I’ve done some research on Danishhappiness, and I have some theories for you.” A recent report, he said, hadnoted that Danes eat more sweets than any other people in Europe. “Danes love toeat,” he confirmed, his roundish figure suggesting that he was speaking frompersonal experience. “There’s a saying in this country, ‘If a man comes at youcarrying a knife, you can be pretty sure he has a fork in the other hand.’”Turning serious, he raised the issue of Danes’ wanting to be heard, whichGundelach also had cited from his research. “From the time that Danes are inkindergarten, they expect to have a say in things,” Seidenfaden said. “They votefor what to have for dinner, where the family goes on vacation, even for how tobe punished if they have misbehaved. The other side of that equation isresponsibility. They’re expected to help with dinner and to behave. When we growup, we have a similar relationship with the government. We expect the governmentto hear us and to take care of us. But on the other hand, we also expect to obeythe rules.”One result of this, Seidenfaden explained, is that consensus is very importantto Danes. He said, “Each week we print some 700 letters to the editor, and allof them begin, ‘A lot of us think that…’ It’s in our DNA. And because we live ina place where we can live out our values. It might explain your happinessfinding.”We’d been talking for more than 30 minutes. Since Seidenfaden ran one ofDenmark’s biggest newspapers, I figured he’d be extraordinarily busy, and Ishould try to wrap it up. But no. The subject of happiness interested him, andhe wanted to keep talking. “Work gets itself done,” he said. Then, picking upthe theme, he said that Danish workers put in only 37 hours a week before goinghome to their families, hobbies, or clubs. They take an average of six weeks ofvacation a year (as opposed to the American average of eight to sixteen days).“I don’t believe in the workaholic culture,” Seidenfaden told me. “I work aslittle as possible, and go home most days by the mid-afternoon. I get a goodnight’s sleep. I always take my seven weeks of vacation. And somehow I alwaysget my work done.”“Isn’t there a price for that?” I asked. Critics might argue that such liberalwork policies result in low productivity.“I don’t believe that either,” he shot back. “I lived in the United States longenough to know that people spend a lot of their workday checking their e-mailsand chatting at the watercooler. Here in Denmark we’re Protestant andpuritanical. Our work is important to our identities. But we get it done and gohome to our families and friends.”HAPPY TAXESFollowing up on the subject of taxes and work, I decided to try next for aninterview with a high-ranking government official. In contrast to Washington,where it might take weeks of negotiating with handlers and media officials toset up an interview with an American politician, it took only two brief phonecalls. The next day, a Saturday, Anders and I headed to Humlebaek, a villagenorth of Copenhagen where low thatched-roof cottages faced a slate gray sea. Atone cottage, fronted by a white picket fence and a small garden of gladiolus, weknocked on the door. A big man with glasses, sandy brown hair, and a crimson andgold Minnesota Gophers sweatshirt tucked into blue jeans answered with anebullient “Hello.” This was Claus Hjort Frederiksen, at the time Denmark’s laborminister, who was also acting prime minister while his colleague was abroad.“Come on in,” he said with a smile.We ducked into a low-ceilinged, simply furnished living room originally built by17th-century peasants. Frederiksen led us to a couch and sat us down. His wifecame in and asked, “Claus, will you be wanting a cup of coffee?” Once more, Iwas reminded of Denmark’s casual society.When I told Frederiksen about the worldwide happiness studies, he was surprisedto hear that Denmark consistently came out near the top. But if the surveys werecorrect, he said, it was probably a function of the nation’s economicprosperity. Located at a geographical gateway between Scandinavia and the restof Europe, Denmark has always enjoyed a trade advantage, he pointed out. “MostDanes speak a few languages, and we are good at a trade,” he said. “We have areputation for trust, so the world likes to do business with us. Trust acts aslubricant in the gears of business and makes it spin faster and more smoothly.”“Yes,” I agreed, “but don’t high taxes tend to slow those gears down?”“Sometimes,” he replied. “But Danes say they don’t mind given the services theyreceive.” By way of example, he pointed to what happens when Danes start afamily. Because of Denmark’s labor market policies, a father has a right to stayat home with the baby for almost a year. In addition to the parents’ rights toreceive benefits during periods of leave, a father employed in the pubslicsector will enjoy a right of up to 14 weeks with full salary. “It’s hard tocomplain when most of your basic needs are covered,” he said.When the time came for us to leave, I asked him about his sweatshirt. “You knowI’m from Minnesota,” I told him. “Did you wear that for me?”“My kids tell me this is the fashion,” he laughed. “I’m wearing it to be cool.”ROYAL INSIGHTAs I continued my research in Copenhagen, I became a commuter like everybodyelse. During the day I’d conduct interviews in the city. Then, each afternoon,I’d take a half-hour train ride to my temporary lodgings in the suburbs. Unlikeeverybody else, however, I was staying on the grounds of an 18th-century palace.My home away from home was Ledreborg Palace, where I was the guest of a longtimefriend, Remar Sutton. Though of relatively modest means—he was the WashingtonPost’s consumer columnist for years—Remar winters in the British Virgin Islandsand spends his summers here in Denmark. He’s a man who attracts a wide range offriends with a sweet Southern drawl and an addictive charm. On any given Tuesdaynight, one might find a billionaire, a Dutch surfer, a Kennedy or Eisenhower,and a West Indian farmer in his kitchen. Countess Silvia Munro and her husband,Jock, the owners of the palace, number among his pals. Several years ago theygave Remar a leasehold on a secluded 300-year-old cottage largely just to havehim around. Remar built two tiny but stylish guest cottages and refurbished hisown with art deco furniture from a thrift shop and some good art. He thenoptimized his grounds for outdoor summer entertainment. Rustic picnic tablesalong a low rock wall seat 48 people, 100 torches light the grounds at night,and the terraced gardens bloom from June to November. Two glass summerhouses inthe garden serve as an outdoor sitting room and dining room, just feet from aninviting fire pit that seats 24 on large stones, sheltered from the wind by acrescent of giant oaks.At the end of my first week there, Remar offered to turn one of these eveningsinto a “happiness party.”“Invite anyone you want,” he said.I invited Anders, Gundelach, and a number of the other people I’d interviewed.By 8:30 that night, with the sun heading down, guests started to arrive. Remarhad lit the torches, which illuminated the gardens and picnic area, and had setpicnic tables with glassware and tall candles before starting the grill. Thegoal was to have fun—and to thank my guests for their help—but I also knew thata number of these experts hadn’t yet met one another. I fully expected moreinsights about happiness to flow with the conversation and wine.His Royal Highness Prince Philippe de Bourbon-Parme walked over from his summerhome with his wife and two sons—a trio of princes and a princess. The Bourbons,as with most of the cousins, are related to many of the royal families ofEurope. Philippe is a direct descendant of France’s Louis XIV and is thegreat-great-grandson of a Danish king. Silvia and Jock Munro arrived onhorseback from the palace. His Highness Dimitri Romanoff, Prince of the House ofRussia, also showed up.At least ten young people—all cousins, virtually all a prince, princess, baron,count, or countess—arrived as well, many with young children and dogs in tow.This was an A-list of European royalty with every bit the pedigree of, say,Charles, the Prince of Wales. But this courtly gathering stood around wearingjeans, drinking beer, and nibbling from a cheese plate. It looked like aslightly upscale version of a Minnesota pot-luck, except the guy next to youeating a wiener might be the grandson of Czar Nicholas II (he was). Likeeverything else in Denmark, even royalty is modest and sensible.Silvia and Jock Munro are handsome, middle-aged parents of four children whomthey sent to public school. They loathe attention. In fact, Silvia relinquishedone of her titles to protect her privacy. The couple’s palace, with itspriceless antiques, hundreds of paintings, and Versailles-like grounds, maysuggest a life of leisure. But property taxes and the Danish work ethic keep thecouple busy 50 hours a week. To maintain the place as a family home, Silvia andJock rent out the vast outbuildings and separate dining halls for corporateevents, and they sponsor concerts during the summer in their private park.Recently they turned a few hundred acres of pasture, framed with thousands ofgiant trees, into a golf course. Sixty years ago, hundreds of workers and palacestaff helped run the estate. Now, 13 do the job, and most of these employees areforesters, groundsmen, and gamekeepers.“I would have been much better off as a plumber,” Jock once quipped to me.John and Susan Donaldson, friends of Remar’s, are similarly humble. John is aScotsman raised in Tasmania. Susan Moody, his second wife, is a well-knownBritish crime writer. When John’s daughter, Mary, married Frederik, Crown Princeof Denmark, John and Susan became instant celebrities. Many Danes call John theGrandfather of All Danes, since his grandson is in line to become the king. Yousee John and Susan in royal portraits on postcards in every gift shop, and thetabloid press continually hounds them. Yet John, who wears boots and a PaulBunyan beard, is a quiet and thoughtful math professor, and Susan, who lookslike your favorite aunt, avoids the press at every turn.The person who most stood out to me, though, was 19-year-old Prince Joseph deBourbon-Parme, Philippe’s youngest son. Joe is six feet three, blue-eyed, andbuilt like a lumber-jack. His smile is stunning, and he hugs friends and cousinsalike when he greets them. At his age, other European royals would be forcedinto law or business schools to carry forth the family legacy and fortune. NotJoseph. He found his passion in woodwork. Joe was a carpenter’s apprentice, andhad two years left to finish his schooling.“Why didn’t you push your son into doing something, well, more regal?” I askedhis father.“Whatever for?” Philippe retorted with a smile. “I want him to be happy withwhat he does.”Remar, who is 68, and even in jeans and flip-flops still manages to projectSouthern charm, stood up and called for the group’s attention with a fork tap onhis wineglass.“National Geographic has come to our little world to find the secret ofhappiness, and it is our duty to help,” he said. He then posed the topic to hisguests: “Let’s tell Danny what it is about Danes that might explain why they arehappier than everyone else.”“Well, I can tell you that they have a maddening obsession with consensus,”began Jock, a Scotsman by birth, who had lived in Denmark for 25 years. “If youlive in an apartment building, they will have a meeting to discuss what color topaint the walls and spend three hours deciding to paint it green, making sureeveryone has a voice. And no statement is too ridiculous. Even if you saysomething really stupid, someone will respond, sincerely, by saying, ‘Thank youfor sharing.’”“Yes, but that’s what’s important to Danes,” added a sociologist who referred toa recent study showing that, in terms of work satisfaction, Danes who were happyin their work environment, even if they were paid less per hour, were morelikely to stay at their jobs. The research suggests that Danes appreciated theirwork satisfaction more than their weekly paycheck. “For many of us, having avoice brings us more happiness than money does,” he said.“I think money and success are the secret to happiness. It’s as simple as that,”retorted Philippe Bourbon, a dead ringer for Prince Albert with his round, ruddyface; longish brown hair; full beard; and upturned mustache. “But then again,”he said after a pause, “your neighbor’s failure isn’t bad either.”We moved on to dessert. The summer dusk descended as the sky muted from milkyblue to a luminescent lavender. Remar tapped me on the shoulder and ushered meto the other end of the table where a lean, casually dressed woman sat quietlyeating her cake. She seemed unfazed by the party’s fuss and confusion. She wasCountess Marie Holstein-Ledreborg, known affectionately as Aunt Marie, “thehappiest person you’ll meet in Denmark,” Remar assured me.At 87, Marie had largely shunned a lifetime of pomp and palace etiquette for thelife of a photographer. She also has no fear. When seated next to a guest ofRemar’s who had just flown in by private jet, Marie turned to him and asked,“And how much of your fortune did you steal?”I pulled up a chair next to Marie and told her that I was researching happiness.I asked if she might have some insight.“I don’t really think I can help you,” she replied politely and looked away. Buta few moments later she turned back to me with a thought. “You know, I was partof the Danish Resistance during World War II. The Nazis captured and imprisonedme. I didn’t know if they were going to release me, take me to Germany, or killme. They kept me like this for five weeks.”She fell silent again and stared blankly through her glasses.“Getting over a difficult experience is a gift,” she continued. “Then you knowwhat life is worth. You don’t always think about it, but you always carry itwith you.”ON TO THE WORLD’S HAPPIEST PLACETaking stock of what I’d learned so far, the pieces of the Danish puzzle werestarting to fall into place. The high taxes that I had initially been skepticalabout apparently serve to nudge Danes away from pursuing material wealth to anexcessive degree, while providing them with the kind of long-term satisfactionthat comes from education, health care, and an economic safety net. The folkschool tradition, meanwhile, imbued Danes with an appreciation of the arts, apopulist sense of democracy, and a habit of joining clubs that keeps theseScandinavians from becoming socially isolated. Danish happiness, it seems, isalso strongly linked to the trust that ordinary citizens feel for one anotherand to their sense that their feelings and opinions are adequately heard. Now Iwanted to meet some of these ordinary people, talk to them, and find out howwell these theories held up. So I went back to the databases and identified theregion of Denmark that reported the highest levels of happiness. They pointed meto a surprising community on the Jutland Peninsula.If you could distill all the wisdom from the 4,000 or so academic papers thathave been written about happiness over the past decade and use it to design aplace that would make the most people happy, it wouldn’t be one where thestreets are paved with gold, or one that has a magnificent view of the mountainsor the sea. Little space would be used for luxury shops, country clubs,oversized houses, or other places that distinguish the wealthy from otherclasses. Instead, it would be a place with good schools, free health clinics,day care centers, and diverse places of worship dotting leafy urbanneighborhoods. Bars, cafés, and social clubs would abound, and sidewalks wouldconnect them. Nature—not suburbs—would surround a quiet yet culturally vibrantdowntown. Citizens would be inclined to marry but free to divorce, trustworthybut not nosy, questioning of authority but not judgmental of their neighbors.Women would have engaging—but not all-consuming—jobs close to home. Few peoplewould have too much, and fewer would have too little.Welcome to the city of Århus. Here, people rate themselves on average as 8.5 outof a possible 10 on the happiness scale—among the highest in the world. Locateda hundred miles west of Copenhagen, it’s a region of sensible shoes, pickledherring, and 300,000 or so mostly fair-skinned Lutherans. During the long summerthey picnic in the parks and stay late to drink wine under the midnight sun.During the long winter nights, they find their own brand of joy as they huddlearound candlelight and sing songs to entertain one another. On any given day inÅrhus, you can join a club to play with model trains, to swim in subfreezingwaters, or to train rabbits for jumping competitions. Hans Christian Andersenlived here for a while, as did St. Nicholas, who is buried in a quiet cemeterynear a row of 16th-century houses. In size, arts, ostentation, and notoriety,Århus plays second fiddle to much bigger Copenhagen—but that makes it perfectlyDanish. For this is a city in a country with a smug inferiority complex. “We arethe most modest people on Earth,” poet-scientist Piet Hein once said of Denmark,“and in that way are better than everyone else.”Downtown Århus sits like a giant amphitheater facing the sea that the Danes callthe Kattegat, a body of water connecting the Baltic Sea with the North Sea. Myhome was a tiny room in the Cabin Hotel, where all the rooms are modeled aftership cabins (and bathrooms double as shower stalls). I frequently ate in bistrosaround the central square beneath the shadow of Århus Cathedral, with its315-foot tower. From there it was a short walk to the office of the formermayor, a freckled brunette named Louise Gade, who’d been elected at the age of29. When I stopped by for an interview one morning, a breakfast of fruit, bread,and coffee had been set for us. We talked about my hometown of Minneapolis,where she’d recently been for a conference, before turning to the subject ofhappiness. For the people of Århus, she said, the keys are small-townfriendliness and ready access to nature.Room to Breathe--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The 5 least densely populated states in the U.S. (Alaska, Wyoming, Montana,North Dakota, and South Dakota) all made Gallup’s list of the 10 least stressedstates. People tend to be happier when they have room to stretch out. Denselypopulated Maryland is a noteworthy exception to this trend.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------“We’re a city of 300,000, and yet you can walk to the sea or to the forest,” shesaid. Their city is big enough to have a cosmopolitan museum and entertainmentcomplex—Paul McCartney, Sting, and Depeche Mode have all given concerts thererecently—yet small enough that residents still know one another by their firstnames. When asked what makes her happy (she rates her happiness as a 10), shetold me about a hibiscus plant she was growing at home.“I wake up in the morning and I see that flower, with the dew on its petals, andat the way it’s folding out, and it makes me happy,” she said. “It’s importantto focus on the things in the here and now, I think. In a month, the flower willbe shriveled and you will miss its beauty if you don’t make the effort to do itnow. Your life, eventually, is the same way.”LEARNING THE ART OF LIVINGA few days later, I struck off by bike for Odder, a town about a dozen milessouth of Århus. As I pedaled beyond the limits of the city, I came upon fruitstands set out by farmers to sell strawberries on the honor system. Next totheir crated berries the farmers had left an open box with a sign posting theprice, usually about two dollars a pint. Customers would take what they wantedand leave their money. One box, I noticed, held the equivalent of $20 in Danishkroner. Apparently no one was worried about anyone ripping off the berries andtaking the money, too.For me, this jogged a memory. In Århus I’d met a young economics professor namedChristian Bjørnskov, who’d speculated that the trust Danes have for oneanother—partly based on a lack of corruption among public officials and a goodlegal system—was probably the most important factor contributing to theirhappiness. Danes scored highest for trust in the world, Bjørnskov told me. Hetraced this trust to the Vikings, who told stories of terrible things happeningto people who didn’t keep their word. He also credited the Protestant beliefsystem that makes individuals responsible for their actions (no Catholicabsolution here).“It’s just so much easier living in a place where you can trust one another,”he’d said. “You don’t have to lock your doors. Business can get done with ahandshake and a lot fewer lawyers.”In the village of Beder, about halfway on my journey, I stopped at an oldchurch. Inside (the door was unlocked, of course) it was cool and smelledpleasantly of old must and faded incense. A pipe organ dominated one end of thechurch; an elevated wooden pulpit and simple altar with an open Bible lay at theother. In between, a dozen rows of simple pews, flanked by candle stands, stoodon an ancient stone floor. I imagined the lit candles, the warm and cozy hyggeof Christmas Midnight Mass, and the congregation dressed in tweedy finery andsinging sweet Grundtvig hymns.For a moment, I felt envious of this culture of strong traditions and palpablehistory. In so much of the United States, everything seems fleeting andephemeral. I thought of our holiday season, launched with Black Friday sales atthe mall and concluded with a glut of unneeded gifts in a sea of discardedwrapping paper. By contrast, many Danes still sing around the Christmas tree, goto Midnight Mass in churches like this, and then, as a holiday treat, eat riceporridge with slivered almonds and cherry sauce.Entering the village of Odder, I pedaled down the main street with buildingslike gingerbread houses. I had come to see the legacy of the folk schools thathad so shaped the Danish character. Now, after I’d spent a couple of weekstrying to put my finger on what explains Danish happiness, I kept coming back toGrundtvig’s theory about these schools. I was increasingly convinced that thefolk schools had helped create an environment that favored what psychologistMihály Csíkszentmihályi calls “flow”: an authentically happy state of engagedactivity that supremely interests you, optimally challenges you, andoccasionally makes time melt away. Though these institutions have continued toevolve during the past century—now they cater to college students in search of alife path and older people seeking intellectual enrichment—they still preserveGrundtvig’s vision of a liberal arts education in an atmosphere of activeparticipation. About 60,000 Danes a year go through a course at one of thecountry’s 74 folk schools.I met Jørgen Carlsen, the headmaster of the local folk school, in his clutteredoffice in the attic of an old building. A poster on his office door showed astenciled portrait of him with a Jerry Garcia beard and glasses. The captionread, in Danish, “To Hell with Skills.” A middle-aged family man, Carlsendescribed his job as a “calling”—part priest, part policeman, and part teacher.He taught classes until two o’clock, walked home for lunch and a nap, andreturned in the late afternoon for his administrative duties. Occasionally he’dstay late for school activities or attend the weekly meeting of the local watersociety. In the summer, he went to his second home by the sea.Finding Flow--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Psychologist Mihály Csíkszentmihályi describes “flow” as a state in which aperson is fully immersed in what he or she is doing. This frequently occurs whena challenging task requires a high degree of skill, such as while playing aninstrument, creating art, fixing a car, or while attempting any task that callsfor a particular skill, talent, or passion.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------“I think part of Danish happiness is that we’re never more than 60 kilometersfrom the sea,” he said. “That creates a sense that there are no obstacles for usand reinforces the freedom we Danes feel over our lives. We’re free, by andlarge, to decide how we will use our time. We delight at the white nights whenthe sun sets at midnight, and we stay out late and drink wine in outdoor cafés.And even midwinter when, with a song and candles, we can create warmth even inthe middle of a cold winter’s night.”Students at Carlsen’s school agree to attend morning assembly, all classes, andsocial events, and to participate actively in songs and poetry. Classes in the12-week program, which are held mornings only, range from pottery to politics.Afternoons are free for independent study, socializing, and exercise in thecountryside. Students come together for dinner, and at night the school offersworkshops and theater.“The idea is to give people an idea of the richness of life,” Carlsen explained.“We believe that a rich person is not necessarily the one with a lot of money.It’s the one who really has a lot to be grateful for: nature, the company ofother people, the capacity to enjoy a good book, and an understanding ofphilosophy. The more things for which you develop a fondness, the richer thelife you live. We’re in the business of cultivating those fondnesses.”That was certainly the case with Michael Artmann, a 40-year-old man I met inÅrhus. Growing up in a working-class family, he’d never expected to make much ofhis life, he told me. His mother, a cleaning lady, had rarely pushed him to dowell in school and, as a result, he had rarely tried. When he graduated, he wasfunctionally illiterate. After trying a series of odd jobs, he got anapprenticeship as a metalworker and ended up on an oil rig in the North Sea. Hefell in love with a more educated woman, a biologist, who had decided to becomean artist. Then, in 1998, during a slump in the oil industry, he decided to takea year off.“My life was work and drink,” he admitted. “And then I enrolled in a folkschool.” I’d met Artmann at a community center called HUSET, a three-storyformer museum where people did carpentry, painted, and made jewelry. Michael wasworking part-time at the center as a volunteer pottery teacher. “The folk schoolchanged everything for me,” he said. “I took courses in ceramics and outdoorliving and discovered that I have some real talents. At age 36, it even inspiredme to learn to read.” We were sitting across from each other at a pottery wheel.He looked both young and old, with crow’s-feet and a creased forehead but also afull head of blond-tipped hair, an earring, and a tight-fitting T-shirt thatread Big League.“I decided that I wanted to be a schoolteacher and spent the next yearlearning,” he continued. “All I did was sleep, eat, go to school, and study. Iessentially crammed 12 years of education into 12 months. Now I have thefundamentals. I feel like I can breathe.” He gestured outward from his chest.Red clay rimmed his fingernails. “I know how to use a computer, and I have justbeen accepted into the university college. Soon I will be a teacher. I get about$900 a month to go to school, which doesn’t pay for much. But it’s enough for meto rent a small place, to buy food and school supplies.”“I don’t get it,” I said. “You make almost no money, you go to school full-time,yet you volunteer 30 hours a week here? Why?”“Because I feel at home here, and I feel very satisfied that I can help,” hereplied. “For so many years, I’ve had nothing to offer except welding pipes. Istarted by taking classes and then throwing pots for my own personal enjoyment.Then people came to ask me for help. It was easy for me to do. I found I couldmake them happy with almost no effort. For the first time, I could make my owndecision about where to work and, at the same time, make a difference.”HOW TO RAISE A FAMILYIt’s 5:15 a.m. in August on the outskirts of Århus. I’ve just woken up on afuton on a floor of polished birch. Overhead is an elegant light fixture encasedin a white origami starburst. In one corner I notice a stylish Bang & Olufsenstereo and a beanbag chair in the shape of a lopsided cut diamond; in anothercorner is a lounge chair for reading. The room is long, flanked on both sides byfloor-to-ceiling shelves, and capped on both ends with windows, into which thelavender light of morning sifts through gauzy curtains. The shelves containartifacts of a life richly lived: books, a clarinet and sheet music, a stack ofjazz albums, a model ship, a world atlas open to the page of a future vacation.Conspicuously missing are a clock and a TV—two enemies of a hobby, a musicalinstrument, or a good book.A long table dominates the middle of the room. Several ad hoc workstations areset up: a laptop computer and ledger at one end of the table, and knittingneedles, yarn, and the beginnings of a gray wool sweater at the other. In themiddle, textbooks and notebooks lie open with pencils and pens. This is a Danishfamily room—or, as I would later come to think of it, a “destination” room—anideal environment in which a family can thrive. A space like this, it occurredto me, clearly has its roots in Grundtvig’s folk schools.This is the home of Erik Kristiansen, who lives with his wife, Susan, theirteenage daughters, Esther and Hannah, and their 13-year-old son, Peter. It’s asmall, four-room brick house. I’d met Erik the previous week at a downtownbookstore café. With his shaved head, muscular build, and angular features, Erikhad a sort of David Beckman good looks. He was getting glances from a group ofmothers who were chatting and drinking coffee next to us, having left their babycarriages parked outside (with babies) along a pedestrian mall—a regularpractice among the trusting Danes. Erik was wearing a T-shirt and jeans, whichstruck me as odd at the time since he was coming from work. But his job callsfor casual clothes. He works for a small business that takes employees into theforest to coach them how to be more productive. When I mentioned that I was inÅrhus looking into Danish happiness and hoping to shadow someone for a few days,he immediately agreed. “Well,” he admitted, “I’m Danish, and I’m very happy.”When we arrived at his house that night, Susan was making salmon and potatosalad in the kitchen. The kitchen was tight, with compact appliances—astainless-steel stove, a washer and dryer stacked in the corner. Soccerschedules, notices of upcoming concerts, and a family picture hung on the walls.On an erasable board there was a cooking schedule that listed each familymember’s meal assignment. When we arrived, Hanna, the younger daughter, wasdirecting her mother to marinate the fish and instructing her siblings to peelpotatoes while she prepared an appetizer of olives, nuts, pickles, and bread.(Erik would later explain that this tight space was a training ground of sortsfor reaching consensus, since it forced five people to constantly negotiate withone another.)We ate dinner at a small kitchen table set with spoons fringed with fork-likeprongs—a kind of spork. (In Denmark, everything seems carefully designed.)Votive candles flickered on the counter, while taller candles lit the table, tocreate the famously Danish warm, homey ambiance—hygge—that helps them enduretheir long, dark winters. Addressing no one in particular, I asked how theyreacted to the notion that Århus could be one of the happiest places in theworld.“I smile,” Erik replied. “I think it could be true, but we don’t think about it.But when I think of it now, Århus is a not a big city but big enough to give youthe opportunity to go to sporting events and concerts. We’re close to nature. Ifyou’re in the center of town, you can bike in any direction and you’re in naturewithin ten minutes. And there’s not a lot of pretense here. Instead of spendingour money on a car or clothes, we spend it on going to Greece, or camping in theforest.”“We don’t like too much authority,” Susan added. “But we trust the policemen andthe government. And in turn, we obey rules that society sets for us not becausewe think we have to, but because it’s part of a social contract. From a veryearly age, we’re taught to have a voice. My children not only decide what weeat, but by the time they are six, they have had an equal voice in where we takeour family vacation and how we budget for household expenses. They call theirteachers by their first names.”“Is that true?” I asked, looking at Peter.“Yes,” he replied. “I decided what you’re eating tonight.”After dinner, the kids didn’t disappear to watch TV (the family has only asingle small set) or to play video games. Instead, as their summer after-dinnerritual dictates, they moved out to the backyard, where Peter built a fire in asmall pit and the conversation continued. “This is the time my family usuallytalks about their day,” Erik told me. “We’re away from the food and confusionand the daily schedules. This is the time we connect.” I looked at 13-year-oldPeter.“Wouldn’t you rather be watching TV?” I asked.“Actually, no,” he said.This family seemed almost too perfect. But they were just being Danish.THE PARAGON OF DANISH HAPPINESSBefore leaving Denmark, I met one more individual whose story has stuck with me.At first glance, Jørn Munk Hemmingsen might not seem to be an ideal candidatefor happiness. A former attorney in a high-powered Copenhagen firm, he sat downone afternoon ten years ago and wrote a letter of resignation to his partners.He didn’t tell his wife what he was going to do, because he knew that if he did,the two of them would discuss the idea for months, and he’d probably never gothrough with it. In the letter, he acknowledged his 18 productive years at thefirm and thanked his partners for their integrity and friendship. He said hewasn’t unhappy with the working conditions and that he had been paid more thanenough money. “Nevertheless, as of midnight tonight,” he wrote, “I will beresigning my post as senior partner of the firm.”A couple days later, a knock came at his door at home. Hemmingsen’s wife, whowas preparing for work, opened it to find the president of the law firm standingthere holding Jørn’s letter in two hands. Inside, the man sat down in thecouple’s small, light-filled living room, and Hemmingsen’s wife served coffee.Hemmingsen sat across from him and fidgeted nervously as his former bossgingerly posed questions. Had the firm somehow mistreated him? Was it an equityissue? Something else?“No,” said Hemmingsen, “I’ve just decided to leave.”Pulling Hemmingsen’s wife aside, the president offered to pay for psychologicalcounseling. But Hemmingsen declined with a smile. He knew what he was doing. “Irealized my life was slipping away quickly,” he said. “And it just terrifiedme.”In the ensuing months, Hemmingsen and his wife sold their big house in the cityand bought a smaller one on the edge of town. Hemmingsen traded in his Mercedesfor a bicycle. He whiled away his afternoons reading books on history and art.He meditated. Six times a week he ran ten kilometers around a nearby lake. Inthe early evening, he’d share a glass or two of wine with his wife and talkabout her day. He didn’t have much to report.One day, while perusing the newspapers, he noticed an ad for a warehouseposition at Ikea. The job involved driving a forklift and lifting crates. Heapplied for the job. The warehouse manager looked at his résumé and, noticinghis 18 years at a prestigious law firm, asked why he was applying for awarehouse job.“Have you been in jail, or something?”“No, I just want to work with my hands,” Jørn replied, outstretching his arms ina gesture of explanation.Hemmingsen got the job and began a new chapter in his life. He started at Ikeaas a warehouse worker, hoisting boxes onto shelves and finding greatsatisfaction in the manual labor. He lost 15 pounds. Within a year, he waspromoted to warehouse manager, another new challenge at which he excelled. Butwithin 18 months of this promotion, he tired of managing people. So he quitagain. And once more he found himself confronted by a boss bewildered by hisdecision to leave.“I’m glad I did it,” he said, recalling the experience. “But it wasn’t my truepassion.”So Hemmingsen opened up a small practice as a counselor, where he now works from9 a.m. to 1 p.m. As a mediator, he helps families to stay together or toseparate peacefully. It’s work that addresses his values, he says, but alsoleaves him time to pursue his hobbies and health.I met him at his office one afternoon to bike with him back to his house. Hedidn’t actually invite me. I just asked if it would be okay, and afterdemurring, he said, of course, no problem. A thin, athletic man with a handsome,owlish face, he speaks with a quick wit that turns his fractured English into analmost poetic use of language. When I asked him why he changed jobs, forexample, he replied, “Because I was looking for a new string on the instrumentof my life.”Setting off through the city, we pedaled a few hundred yards over cobblestonestreets, across a highway, and then, abruptly, into nature. Taking a bike paththrough a forest, we crossed several bridges and finally arrived on the shoresof Brabrand Lake, about two miles outside of town. Halfway around the lake,Hemmingsen stopped his bike and pointed to a pathway into the forest. Wedismounted and followed the path to a clearing and a small dock. “Here, Imeditate every day,” he said.At his house, Hemmingsen poured me a soda pop called Squash and we sat out onthe patio. There he explained why he and his wife are still in love after 30years, even though they have totally different hobbies and values. When he takeshiking trips into the Austrian Alps, for example, his wife never joins him.“She’s a shopper,” he explained. I asked him if he was sorry she didn’t go.“No,” he shot back, cutting off my question. “She would never stop talking.”While this doesn’t sound like the type of response you’d hear from a happy man,he explained that he appreciated living with someone different. “Two of mewouldn’t have worked,” he said.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Joy of ExercisePeople living in thriving countries tend to participate in a physical activity 1to 2 times each week, according to the Gallup World Poll. Those who participatein even small amounts of physical activity report smiling more, or being treatedwith respect on a regular basis.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Since Hemmingsen has run 250 kilometers a month ever since he quit his full-timejob, I thought I might learn something about him by joining him on a run. As wetrotted down his driveway to the lake path, I noticed that he cantered more thanran—he had this bouncy but fluid gait, like running on springs. I’m a fit guyand have tried to retain some of the conditioning from my long-distancebicycling days, so I figured I could easily keep up with him. After all, he wasalmost 20 years older than I. But after galloping the first kilometer of ourten-kilometer sprint, I was hurting and bargained him down to five. He agreedreadily.“Do you always run this fast?” I asked, wheezing and panting. I had beenbragging about the world records I held for cycling across the Americas andAsia. He looked at me and cocked his head questioningly.“No,” he said. “I usually run much faster.”I’m thinking, he’s giving me a line of bullshit. So, I say, “Why don’t we run atyour pace then. I’ll keep up.”“This is fine,” he replied matter-of-factly. And with that, he kicked up hispace to a seemingly effortless dash. For me this felt like an all-out sprint. Mythighs burned. My knee ached. I felt like I was going to exhale my lungs. I keptup with him for no more than 15 seconds, after which he disappeared around thecurve of the lake, a hundred meters ahead. By the time I finished the lap, hehad already showered and was drinking an orange juice on his deck.He poured a glass for me.“You kicked my ass,” I said, still panting.“Please,” he replied. “That kind of talk will never make a Dane happy.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lessons from DenmarkSome people say Danes are happy because they have low expectations. Not true. Ifthey don’t aspire, on the whole, to accumulate great wealth or to achieve worlddominance, what they do expect in terms of education, health care, socialinteraction, and exposure to the arts far outstrips what Americans expect. TheDanish path to happiness, after all, isn’t about aspiring to scale peaks butrather about the satisfaction that comes from living at a high plateau. It’sabout thriving in an environment that nudges them away from superficialpleasures and toward lasting—and sometimes counterintuitive—activities thatbring authentic happiness.Build an Environment of TrustWorldwide surveys show that the Danes are among the most trusting andtrustworthy people on the globe. In Århus you can leave your baby carriage (andbaby) parked outside a café and not have to worry. Of course, trust works twoways. Danes also strictly obey laws. A pedestrian in Copenhagen will waitpatiently at a crosswalk until the light turns green at four in the morning evenif there isn’t a hint of traffic. Business works more efficiently and betterwhen people can trust each other. That may explain why Denmark is also one ofthe richest nations per capita. The lesson: Live in trustworthy places, surroundyourself with trustworthy friends, and be trustworthy yourself.ToleranceTolerance of other races and lifestyles correlates with happiness in manynational surveys. The Danes were among the first to give women the vote, toallow gays to marry, and to permit pornography. Some might label these policiesas permissive, while others simply point to the history of civil rights in placelike the United States, where as recently as 1950, it was a radical idea for ablack person to marry a white person—or even to sit at the front of a bus.Seek Status EqualityIn Denmark, modesty is a virtue. Here the garbageman fits seamlessly into anupper-class neighborhood, the businessman sits in the front seat of a cab. Insome parts of the world, people feel the need to compete with their neighbors topossess a bigger house, a nicer car, or more fashionable clothes. Here there’sno pressure to keep up with the Joneses; in fact, you lose points by showingoff. The lesson: Look for neighborhoods where people are about as rich (or aspoor) as you are. Build your social circle with those who accept you and don’tmake you feel that you need nicer clothes, a bigger car, or anything more thanwhat you already have.Seek Economic EqualityWith one of the lowest disparities in the world between rich and poor, Denmarkdevotes about half its annual budget to smoothing out society’s inequalities.That might be a lesson for other nations. Economic equality contributes to asense of security. One caveat: Danes also possess a Protestant work ethic andare inclined to work hard independent of financial incentives.Care for the Young and OldDanes spend more money per capita than almost any other nation on their childrenand the elderly. Young people get an excellent education and health care.Equipped with a strong liberal arts education, they make productive employees.Older people are similarly well cared for. Adults spend little time worryingabout retirement and focus more on pursuing the jobs they love. Older people canenjoy their final years with the knowledge that the necessities will be covered.It’s a virtuous circle.FreedomThere’s a complex relationship between happiness and freedom. Children here aretaught from an early age to make up their own minds, kids call their teachers bytheir first names, and freedom in general is cherished. This freedom teachespeople how to make good decisions. They are free to try out a job and fail, as asocial safety net will catch them. They are also free to speak their minds, andfor the most part to do what they want. This is all tempered, of course, by asense of social responsibility and a solid work ethic.Get the Right JobMost of our waking hours are consumed by our jobs. In the United States, manypeople chose a job based on how much it pays or how much it will impress theirfriends. In Denmark, where taxes consume most of people’s wages, and ambition isfrowned upon, there’s no upside to taking a job for pay or status. So peopletake jobs that interest them, which gives them a better chance to feelsatisfaction and flow in their careers. Danes specialize in furniture design,niche technology, art, and architecture—creative, challenging careers thatstimulate the kind of engaged happiness that psychologist MihályCsíkszentmihályi calls “flow.”Work Just EnoughMost Danes work 37 hours a week and go home to their families or theirassociations. They take an average of six weeks of vacation. If people work formoney, they do so to get just enough. The lesson: Knock off at 5 p.m. and takeyour vacations. The Danes’ Protestant work ethic is tempered by theirunderstanding that working too hard—or too long—is a waste of time. So they gettheir jobs done and pursue other things they enjoy.Cultivate the Art of LivingProactively develop an appreciation of art that will last a lifetime. Denmark’svisionary educator and philosopher Nikolai Grundtvig launched folk schools thatgave the sons and daughters of peasants a liberal arts education in literature,music appreciation, and art. They also learned the art of conversation. Today,there are still more than 90 state-subsidized folk schools where people of allwalks of life can develop their love of the arts.Make Cozy, Well-Lit Home EnvironmentsWinters are long and dark in Denmark, where night falls by 4:45 on Novemberafternoons. To compensate, Danes have created cozy environments with candles,the warmth of the hearth, and the gathering of friends.Nudge People into InteractionWhile Danes are not particularly outgoing, they have a tradition of joiningassociations and volunteering—19 of 20 people belong to clubs as varied asrabbit jumping, cold-water swimming, and handball. These clubs make a bigdifference in a nation where isolation means unhappiness.Optimize Cities for ActivityIt’s hard to be happy when you’re unhealthy. Danes tend to be fit, with lowerbody mass indexes and lower rates of obesity than some of their Europeanneighbors. Danish cities are designed so it’s easy to walk or bike from oneplace to another. With a 30-minute walk, you can travel from the cobblestonecenter of Copenhagen all the way to the queen’s castle, which doubles as a park,or to the sea, where people swim and sail, or to the woods on the edge of town.Recreation is accessible to everyone. The lesson: Make walkable, bikeable citieswith high-quality parks a priority, not an afterthought.VolunteerMore than 30 percent of Danes volunteer their time to benefit their communities.This makes for a healthier society and helps people take the focus off their owntroubles. Michael Artmann, the unemployed welder with a grade school education,still finds time to enhance his life through volunteering.Use TaxesNo one loves Denmark’s high marginal tax rate, but surveys show they tolerateit. As a result, everyone has health care, young people are nudged intoeducation because it’s free, and all citizens have a safety net should they findthemselves down on their luck or eager to find a job that better suits them.High taxes on energy use have spurred investment in renewable energy. In2006–2007, Denmark had the largest greenhouse gas emission reductions of EUcountries, 6 percent. Renewable resources currently supply almost 30 percent ofDenmark’s electricity.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREESINGAPORE:Can You Manufacture a Happy Nation?image [Images/88.jpg]Joyful relatives surround a bride and groom at a Malay wedding in Singapore,where as many as 2,000 guests may be invited, emphasizing the importance ofsocial networks in the Malay community. PHOTO BY DAVID MCLAIN/AURORASingapore:Can You Manufacture a Happy Nation?It does not matter what color the cat as long as it catches the mouse.—Proverb Many travelers to Singapore begin their visit at Changi International Airport, asprawling, sanitized compound where bright lights, crisp guards, polished brass,and crystal cut glass create a Disney-esque air of cleanliness and efficiency.Glaring signs show you the way to customs and immigration. They also warn thatno photography, smoking, or gum chewing is allowed. After you wait in a veryshort line, a customs guard dressed in a stiff blue uniform with epaulets greetsyou with a regulation smile, offers you a mint, and mechanically stamps yourpassport. Then a gaggle of politely predatory taxi drivers meets you in theterminal. They hawk rides to any destination on this island nation for a $35flat rate.My driver turned out to be a fiftyish woman in cat glasses and black tights. Hertaxi, a spotless fire-engine red Mercedes adorned with little stuffed animals,bobblehead trolls, and rhinestone windshield trim, was purring at the curbside.She popped the trunk, which neatly held everything one might need to either fixa flat tire or host a picnic, and loaded my bags. Then she scurried around toopen the door for me. As we whisked down the tree-lined street through a forestof high-rises, I noticed that neatly manicured shrubs stood like soldiers alongthe highway. “We’re very proud of how clean our country is,” my driver offeredin Chinese-accented English. “We’ve had much public education to remind us notto litter.”“Your government must spend a great deal of money to keep these shrubs and treesso trim,” I commented. She just shrugged.“It’s public education.”She told me she was a widow and lived in an apartment with her mother, since hersiblings were all married. “Of course, if I had more money, I’d like to live bymyself, and then I could do as I pleased,” she remarked. I asked if her mothercooked or cleaned, or if there were any other benefits to her living in hermother’s house.“No, it’s our tradition to have parents live with children,” she said. “It’s ourduty.”“But if you had the money, you’d live on your own?”“No,” she said finally, changing her mind.When we arrived at the Sheraton, a white-gloved doorman offered to take mybackpack, and the front desk staff greeted me with the same smiling efficiencythat I’d encountered at customs. In my room I found a letter signed by thegeneral manager, who expressed his desire to make my “lodging product” of thehighest quality. I unpacked, showered, slipped on the hotel’s complimentary,cellophane-wrapped cotton slippers, flicked on CNN, and settled in to enjoy mylodging product.I was starting to see what people meant when they said that Singapore takes somegetting used to.Months earlier, when I’d first started thinking about visiting Asia’s happiestplace, I’d assumed I’d be booking a plane trip to Tibet, where I’d hang out withBuddhist monks and followers of the Dalai Lama. Or that I’d be winging my way toFiji with its sun, sugar sand beaches, and sensual native charms. Or perhaps I’dhike to Bhutan, the tiny, mountainous country between India and China, whoseking famously downplayed the concept of gross national product as a measure ofnational wealth in favor of an index of gross national happiness.But one of my chief consultants, sociologist Ruut Veenhoven, had steered me awayfrom the usual places. Too often, he said, the places we imagine as paradisesdon’t measure up when it comes to basic prerequisites for happiness, such asdecent food, basic shelter, adequate health care, and mobility. Such placessuffer from what Veenhoven calls the “happy native” myth. Tourists who come fora few weeks to enjoy the stunning beauty or effusive hospitality of the localpeople see colorfully dressed kids laughing and playing and assume that theylive in a stress-free paradise. What the tourists don’t see is that the samekids have a parasite in their bellies and no hope of getting a decent education,that Dad is stuck in a job he hates, and that Mom is secretly abused.Singapore Facts--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Region: East AsiaLocation: Island city-state located off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsulaabout 85 miles north of the EquatorPopulation: 5.1 million people--------------------------------------------------------------------------------No, Asia’s true happiness hot spot is a 40-mile-long island nation on thesouthern tip of the Malay Peninsula, Veenhoven had said. He was talking aboutSingapore, of course, home of 5.1 million people and 250 or so shopping malls.With one of the highest population densities in the world—more than 19,000people squeezed into every square mile—Singaporeans live vertically inskyscrapers and high-rises. Expectations about the quality of life have risen,too; workers put in long hours in pursuit of the five C’s: cash, credit card,car, condominium, and club membership. Known as a society of workaholics,Singapore has also become famous for its paternalistic government, whichstrictly enforces laws on the most trivial of infractions, from chewing gum inpublic to failing to flush a toilet. Offenders convicted of crimes from sellingheroin to spraying graffiti on a wall are strapped to a wooden frame so a caningofficial can deliver flesh-splitting lashes with a soaked rattan switch, leavinga bloody pool on the floor.And this place is happy?Yes, it is, Veenhoven had insisted, at least by Asian standards. Independentstudies conducted between 2000 and 2009 reported higher levels of happiness inSingapore than in any other Asian nation. The World Values Survey found that 95percent of people in Singapore said they were very happy or quite happy. In2005-2009, the Gallup organization interviewed a cross section of people in eachof more than 130 countries around the globe. Citizens were asked to rank theircurrent circumstances on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 being the “best possiblelife.” Researchers asked Singaporeans if they were well rested, treated withrespect, experienced smiling or laughing, engaged in learning or interest, orfelt enjoyment, and also about “negative experiences,” including physical pain,worrying, sadness, stress, depression, or anger, to arrive at a measure of dailyexperiences. Singaporeans rated a 6.9, and only 2 percent reported feelingdepressed. Of all the people of Asia, Veenhoven had said, the citizens ofSingapore were definitely the happiness rock stars.Still, my first impression of Singapore was one of a well-scrubbed,shrink-wrapped nation of march-in-step people hell-bent on getting ahead. Couldsuch people really be happy? Yes, the experts said. “People tend to be skilledat monitoring their own emotions and generally know how intensely they areexperiencing happiness,” write psychologists Ed Diener and Robert Biswas-Dienerin Happiness: Unlocking the Mysteries of Psychological Wealth. “We refer to‘happiness’ as ‘subjective well-being’ in scientific parlance, because it isabout how people evaluate their lives and what is important to them. Anindividual’s subjective well-being is often related to some degree to his or herobjective circumstances, but it also depends on how people think and feel aboutthese conditions. Subjective well-being encompasses people’s life satisfactionand their evaluation of important domains of life such as work, health, andrelationships.” What makes one person happy might not be the same for someoneelse, in other words. People in different cultures value things differently. Forthe purposes of comparative analysis, therefore, a measurement of subjectivewell-being is the most reliable information we have about happiness.As the polls confirmed, people in Singapore reported being happy. Was itpossible that, for some reason, they weren’t being honest in the surveys? Werethey worried, for example, that their government might disapprove if they saidthey were unhappy? Perhaps. Studies have shown that individuals in Asiancultures can be sensitive about how they present themselves to other people. Butif Singaporeans wanted to fib about their happiness to the Gallup people, whystop at a 6.9 and not push the meter to a 7.5 or a 9? If there was some sort ofsubtly programmed compulsion to make the country look good, or to avoidacknowledging that people work too hard, a 6.9 out of 10 is not that convincing.And what about other Southeast Asian nations? Singapore’s results are in linewith the culturally similar countries of that part of the world. This suggeststhat either the respondents from the entire region are fibbing collectively—butin a not very dramatic way—or they are generally giving honest assessments ofhow they feel. Happiness researchers see consistencies of that sort as anotherreason to trust survey results.Subjective Happiness--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The term “subjective well-being” includes a combination of happiness, peace,fulfillment, and life satisfaction. In short, it is a snapshot of how a personperceives his or her own happiness.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------But even if we were to accept that Singaporeans really are happy, the bigquestion remains: Why? And what can they teach the rest of us?EVEN ARTIFICIAL SNOWThe next day, I struck off into the wilds of downtown Singapore. Getting aroundwas easy. Subways are punctual and immaculate, and walkways are clearly markedwith pictures, signs, and maps on every block. Forget how to use the stairs? Atboth the top and the bottom of the stairway, explicit directions remind you tostay to the right and to take one step at a time. Three thousand buses stop atover 4,500 bus stops on the island. Need a taxi? Nearly 20,000 of them prowl thestreets and are ready to take you anywhere. In case you’re still at a loss,omnipresent eager-beaver police officers are quick to help.I wandered by some of Singapore’s famous hawker stalls, the sterile foodpavilions that the government created to get pushcarts and street vendors offthe street. Imagine a huge, spotless picnic area surrounded by food standsserving fantastic exotic items: tiger prawns, “morning glory” greens with shrimppaste, chili-encrusted stingray, oyster omelets, duck in plum sauce,lemon-accented cane juice, mango pudding, and more. Each sparkling stand hadgarish pictures of food offerings with slightly misleading prices (the shrimpwas advertised as five dollars per 100 grams, but the smallest shrimp weighed200 grams). As soon as I walked in, vendors pounced on me, thrust a menu at me,and led me to a table, whether I followed them or not. This was my firstexposure to Singapore’s famously aggressive can’t-lose attitude. The service wassurly but efficient; the food was good.Later I walked down to Orchard Road, the old colonial thoroughfare that servesas Singapore’s Times Square-meets-Piccadilly Circus—a reminder of the country’sBritish roots. At the beginning of the 19th century, this had been little morethan a fishing village. In 1819, British statesman and amateur naturalist SirThomas Stamford Raffles negotiated a deal with local chiefs to secure the newlyminted enclave on the southernmost tip of the Malay Peninsula for the BritishEmpire. Within decades, it grew into one of the empire’s most prosperoussettlements, attracting immigrants from China, India, and Malaysia. By the1940s, this merchant class was asserting its voice; the tiny nation waspreparing to stand on its own.Now, as I strolled down the country’s main street, I experienced neither Britishstuffiness nor the crazy smells and noises one might expect of Southeast Asia.Instead, a unique hybrid culture had emerged. It was a December evening, andgreat crowds of orderly people—mostly of Chinese descent but also Malay, Indian,and a few white expatriates—moved down packed streets like a human tsunami.Shopping malls brandishing names like Ralph Lauren, Hermès, Mont Blanc, and Todddominated the landscape. The Four Seasons Hotel advertised a $90 Sunday brunch.A line snaked out of the Gucci shop. For what, I wondered. A blue light specialon loafers? Outside one mall, “snow” fell surrealistically on an enormousChristmas tree and a stunned crowd. Great snow guns shot granulated suds intothe air, and they sifted down onto shrieking, gleeful children and their fawningparents. A nearby sign blinked the time and temperature: 6:43 p.m. and 36°C(97°F).Was this what happiness meant in Singapore? Expensive gifts and artificial snow?After my first couple of days on the island, I was beginning to ask myself ifanybody in so manufactured an environment could really be happy. It seemed to methey had all the trappings of success but none of the soul. If Singaporeans weretelling researchers they were happy, maybe they were just deluding themselves.FIRST PIECES OF THE PUZZLETo test my hypothesis, I paid a visit to Dr. Tan Ern Ser’s cluttered office atSingapore’s Institute of Policy Studies. As his nation’s representative for theWorld Values Survey, Tan had collected more than 1,500 surveys to determine thenation’s well-being and associated values. He had also spent a good bit of timein the United States at Cornell University and the University of Michigan. Theday I met him, he was wearing a casual shirt, gray slacks, and comfortableloafers. We exchanged a few pleasantries and talked about his children and howhe likes to take them to the zoo on the weekends. Then he showed me his own listof the values and priorities that he felt were most closely associated withwell-being in Singapore. Good health, a feeling of public safety, and a regardfor family topped the list. Environment and politics were at the bottom.“Happiness here is largely rooted in the fact that the government has seen tothe fundamentals of well-being,” said Tan, speaking in careful sentencestempered by academic rigor and an understanding that in this nation, too muchcandor in certain matters can cost you your job. The country is “well run,” hewent on to say. Government ministers in Southeast Asia are often underpaid andon the take, he added. But in Singapore, they’re often trained in American IvyLeague schools and paid seven-figure salaries. Bribery carries harsh penalties(which may help explain why, according to Transparency International, Singaporehas one of the world’s lowest rates of corruption). There is almost no severepoverty, he said. Compared to other parts of Southeast Asia, there are alsorelatively few ethnic problems (in Tan’s surveys, 90 percent of Singaporeanssaid they were proud to be Singaporean). The fact that English is the linguafranca also puts the major ethnic groups on an equal footing when it comes tocommunication. Housing laws also promote mixing of ethnic groups. In everypublic housing high-rise, 77 percent of the residents must be Chinese, 14percent Malay, and 8 percent Indian, reflecting the same proportions as thegeneral population. So there are no ethnic slums.“But what about all of the petty rules?” I asked. “What about the laws finingpeople who spit, chew gum, or forget to flush the toilet? Doesn’t the fact thatthe government can litigate you into the poorhouse for expressing politicaldissent bother people?”“People do grumble about the rules,” Tan said. “But the government goes out ofits way to explain why they’re in place. Over time, the annoyance eases, andpretty soon we just adapt. Now most people just take them as part of life, andwe reap the benefit of not stepping on gum or someone else’s phlegm. We haveflush toilets that work. People like freedom, but they also like stability andsecurity. All societies are trying to find that happy medium, and our countryhas done a pretty decent job at it. My theory of happiness is that if you’rehopeful and confident of getting what you want in life, then you are happy. Ifyou feel like your path is always blocked, then you’re not going to be happy.Singapore makes sure your path is not blocked.” From Tan’s point of view, peoplein Singapore are willing to give up certain freedoms to gain greater safety andopportunity.For another perspective, I traveled across town to meet Dr. Ho Kong Weng, aneconomist at Nanyang Technological University. Ho had just completed his ownround of studies on happiness, which suggested that religious people are lessconcerned with money than nonreligious people, and that the most importantpredictor of whether a child will be happy is the happiness of his or hermother. When I asked Ho why Singapore outperforms the rest of Asia in terms ofhappiness, he pointed first to Singapore’s remarkable economic growth. Duringthe past 40 years, he said, the wealth of the average Singaporean has multiplied11 times—the fastest growth of any economy in the history of the world. Byoffering generous tax breaks, Singapore has lured multinationals to invest inthe small nation. Meanwhile, Singapore has made huge investments in domesticuniversities and grants to enable scholars to study abroad. The government alsohas made it easy for foreign immigrants to enter the country and fill new jobs.The ensuing upward spiral has created a feeling of constant progress toward the“good life,” Ho said. For a society obsessed with achievement, Singapore’seconomy has supremely “unblocked the path to perceived happiness.” On top ofthat, he said, Singapore has one of the world’s lowest levels of unemployment,and the differences between rich and poor have remained relatively small.“Though we have a number of very rich,” he said, “the overwhelming majority ofSingaporeans are middle-class, and they set the standard, which is good. It’svery clear from world data that inequality has a negative impact on happiness,”he said.That made sense to me. The promise of prosperity tends to make anyone happy. I’dalso heard that Singapore owes at least part of its high happiness quotient toits strong family ties. To help keep families together, the government offerstax subsidies to citizens who care for aging parents. Partly as a result, 84percent of seniors live with their children. That makes all family members feellike they’re part of a legacy, rather than just lonely individuals.I had one more name at the top of my interview wish list: the elusive masterarchitect of Singapore’s society, Lee Kuan Yew. As a young firebrand in 1959,the Cambridge-educated lawyer suddenly found himself in control of a newsociety. During his first six years in office, he steered the country throughuneasy alliances with both communist China and Malaysia. When Singapore finallyachieved independence on August 9, 1965, Prime Minister Lee broke down and criedat a press conference. But these weren’t tears of joy. He had actually foughthard to keep Singapore connected to Malaysia because he believed that his nationwas too small to survive in the gladiator ring of the free world. With nonatural resources, no real industry, an ominous proximity to heroin-producingcountries, and a prickly relationship with its much bigger—and closest—neighbor,Malaysia, Singapore seemed to have the deck stacked against it. Moreover, itspopulation was made up of three disparate cultures—Chinese, Malay, andIndian—creating fertile ground for ethnic tension. Considering this backdrop,how could this neophyte country survive, let alone achieve Asia’s highest levelsof happiness? I was dying to ask the man who had led the way.Asia’s Happy Places--------------------------------------------------------------------------------When residents of Asian countries were asked to reflect on current lifesatisfaction, these countries reported the highest levels according to Gallup:1. Singapore, 2. Japan, 3. South Korea, 4. Thailand, 5. Indonesia, 6. Taiwan, 7.Malaysia, 8. Myanmar, 9. Vietnam, 10. Bangladesh.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------After several months of pursuing an interview through official channels,however, I’d gotten nowhere. Even after I arrived in Singapore, people told meit was impossible. Lee had complained about being burned too many times byWestern reporters who lambasted him for the government’s strict laws. “Expectseveral months for a reply,” Lee’s office had told me.So I turned my attention to finding a few examples of Singapore’sself-proclaimed happy citizenry.A PERFECT LIFE (ALMOST)One evening, at the suggestion of photographer David McLain, I caught up withCelina Lin at a posh restaurant near the water. McLain had shot her portrait afew days earlier and had come away impressed by her story. “You have to meether,” he had said. “She’s a self-made millionaire, socialite, and a beauty—theperfect picture of Singaporean success.”It was still early when I arrived at il Lido restaurant. The crescent-shapeddining room fused contemporary Danish furniture with faux Romanesque columns andfloor-to-ceiling windows that displayed a 180-degree sweep of Singapore Strait.The urban pulse of techno music was just audible over the subdued din of theyoung moneyed class who were chasing down seared scallops with pomegranatemartinis to fortify themselves for the night ahead. Lin was sitting at the bar.She wore a low-slung, lavishly embroidered gold top, tight-fitting designerjeans, and high heels. She had a delicate face with a small, expressive mouthand flawless alabaster skin, framed by shoulder-length black hair anddiamond-flecked chandelier earrings. She was holding a flute of fine champagnelanguidly off to one side.I knew a few things about Lin already, as I had read a profile of her in a localmagazine. She’d been named as one of the ten individuals who “exemplify power inSingapore.” After rising through her country’s fiercely competitive academicranks to earn a degree in psychology from the National University of Singapore,she’d turned to banking. For seven years, she’d worked as a broker and currencytrader, often swimming upstream against the male-dominated current ofSingaporean finance. At age 29, with one bold and brilliant currency bet, she’dsecured a personal fortune. That had allowed her, as she told the magazine, toretire to “dedicate myself to the arts and self-development.” She had bought aPorsche and a downtown condominium that she decorated with tasteful art andstaffed with a live-in maid. Then, over the years, she had filled her closetwith 300 pairs of shoes and clothes to match. Her attention to fashion and herfriendships with designers had helped her win the title of one of “Singapore’s12 Icons of Style.” A few months earlier, a film she’d helped make, SingaporeDreaming, was released to critical acclaim.Now Lin was telling me about her current passion, a jewelry business. “I travelto fashion capitals every year, places like Milan, Paris, and Tokyo, and theninterpret the trends into my work,” she said in precise English, her secondlanguage. “We must have some food,” she said, interrupting herself to beckon awaiter with a wave. “Pappardelle with duck ragout and black truffle,” sheordered. “You should get Hokkaido scallops with asparagus,” she said, and thenordered it for me. We talked for another 45 minutes. At precisely 8 p.m., sheannounced that she had to leave. The bill was mysteriously paid for.“I’m going to a party. Would you like to join me?” she asked without waiting fora response. She knew the answer was yes.We took a taxi to a charity ball at Sentosa Country Club, a Victorian nexus ofluxury on a rare expanse of green. In a great hall, a Gatsby-esque jazz band wasperforming and Singapore’s gowned and tuxedoed glitterati were dancing,cavorting, and exchanging gossip. Most of the partygoers appeared to be ofChinese descent, but there were also expatriates, mainly rising stars in theworld of finance. Heads turned as Lin made her entrance, and she was immediatelyembraced by the hostess, a fiftyish doyenne in a long white dress and pearls.They chatted for a moment—mostly to exchange compliments—and then Lin launchedinto the party. Moving through the crowd like a goldfish among carp, sheembraced friends and treated them to a flash of charm. Meanwhile, I happilyassumed the role of an accoutrement, like a new handbag, as she introduced mearound as her “friend from National Geographic.” I soon realized that I was incharge of cleanup conversations, and I answered a few questions about my book asLin moved on to the next acquaintance.For a successful Singaporean like Lin, this was just another Friday night. Onanother day, the party might have meant hanging out with fashion designers at asprawling nightclub that had once been a waterworks plant. Or thecelebrity-filled opening of Singapore’s first Gap store. Or a dinner party atthe home of a Russian oligarch, where the tycoon’s 12-year-old daughter dazzledguests with a Mozart recital. Having achieved the trappings of material success,Lin seemed to savor them richly. She was dedicated to her jewelry venture, toher friends, and to the fund-raisers she supported. What more could anyone want?“Are you really as happy as you appear to be?” I asked.“Of course,” she shot back. But then, after a reflective pause, she demurred. “Iam as long as I don’t think of someone wealthier, having a more luxurious life,driving a bigger car, having a bigger house, having a wonderful husband whoprovides for her,” she said. “When I think of that, I feel, I mean honestly, Ifeel a tinge of jealousy.”SPARRING OVER PLAYBOYJennie Chua was waiting for me in the chandeliered lobby of Singapore’s famousRaffles Hotel, the 123-year-old hangout of legendary characters like RudyardKipling and Joseph Conrad. At the time, Chua was CEO of Raffles Holdings, Ltd.,which owns and operates not only Raffles hotel but also 40 other hotels andresorts around the world. Routinely profiled in the Singaporean press as a modelof success and philanthropy, Chua also held positions as chairwoman of theSingapore International Chamber of Commerce and chief corporate officer ofCapitaLand, Ltd., the largest property developer in Southeast Asia, and sat onthe boards of more than 20 other business, charitable, and educationalorganizations, such as her American alma mater, Cornell.The first thing I noticed when we met were the marble-size pearls gracing Chua’sneck, the glistening diamond clusters, and a gold ring cradling a dazzlingsapphire—jewels that trumpeted, “I’ve succeeded!” As she sipped a cup of tea,she told me her story—the fishing-village roots, the hard-won education, divorcefrom a domineering partner, a knack for catering to Westerners’ tastes, and arapid ascent to CEO of Raffles Holdings—a story arc not unlike that of her tinynation. As a respected civic leader at the top of her game, she’d gone wellbeyond the five C’s of Singaporean success. Yet she still felt she had notarrived.“Arrived is a difficult thing,” she said.When I asked her what made her most proud of her nation, she said it was thatSingapore is clean and safe. A woman can walk through any neighborhood atmidnight and not be afraid. Subways are immaculate and on time. Public toiletsprovide hand soap. And police officers are unfailingly quick to help.“We’ve always focused on our children’s future,” Chua said when I asked her ifSingaporeans were truly happy. “For so long, it was such a struggle to put aroof over our heads, food on the table, and get our kids educated. Today we havemore things, but our values are the same. The five C’s are just a more glamorousway to provide for our families.”A few days later, Chua invited me to the new condo she’d purchased one floorabove her son’s apartment. This time she looked grandmotherly, having eschewedher jewels for bifocals and a purple warm-up suit. She shuffled among answeringmy questions, unpacking boxes of expensive knickknacks, and keeping hertwo-year-old grandson from breaking them. I looked around at a lifetime ofhigh-end clutter—an ivory chess set, intricately carved Chinese furniture, ateak jewelry box—and asked what she treasured most. She pointed to a simple,framed photo of her two sons, their wives, and her grandchildren.“The generation of men who built this country barely knew their children,” shesaid. “They had an enormous responsibility. They worked all the time and werefiercely competitive. The new generation has evolved and become lesstransactional. They spend weekends with their kids and are beginning to see thevalue of volunteering their time.”I wondered about this kinder, gentler Singapore. Poking a nerve, I reminded herof the lack of free press, the one-party monopoly, and the Friday canings. Atthis she stopped puttering and fixed me with the steely gaze of a woman whounderstood that all forms of happiness involve struggle.“The idea that American democracy is the only path to freedom is arrogant,” shesaid. “I’d rather live in a place where it’s safe for my kids to play today thanone where I can read Playboy tomorrow.”SINGAPORE’S HAPPIEST CORNERIt was one o’clock on a Saturday afternoon, and a wedding was about to takeplace in the open space beneath a 45-story apartment on the outskirts of thecity. The midday sun was beating down with an equatorial ferocity that made thelawns, sidewalks, cement picnic tables, and neighboring buildings all lookwashed out, like an overexposed photograph. Enormous loudspeakers were blaringtraditional music, like an overamplified snake charmer’s horn run amok. Thebride’s father, wearing a tunic, a baby blue shirt, and a lavishly embroideredgold lamé sash, greeted the first of some 2,000 guests. Men and women wereshaking his hand; young boys bowed their heads and kissed his hand in a gestureof respect. Upon seeing me, clearly a foreigner, he welcomed me effusively andmotioned me toward one of the long banquet tables.“Enjoy!” he commanded.Between the cement pillars that supported the apartment building, there was adiaphanous blur of pastels: women wearing purple, lime, baby blue, and crimsonshrouds. Looking cool in the intense heat, men wore loose-fitting, two-piecesuits that looked like pajamas. Servants were ladling steaming plates of curriedmutton from a bubbling 220-gallon copper vat. At the far end of the alcove, thebride and groom sat on thrones under a gauzy, flower-crowned canopy. One by one,guests approached the newlyweds and tossed handfuls of perfumed rice.This, too, was Singapore. The wedding party and their guests were mostlydark-skinned Malays, the ethnic group that first inhabited the island. Now theyshare their tiny country with large populations of both Han Chinese and Indians,whose hardworking cultural traditions have helped them to prosper in Singapore’sgo-go economy. Too often, some say, Malays today see the best jobs go to peoplefrom the other ethnic groups. Too often, others belong to the nicest clubs andmake the most money. By contrast, it seems that Malays are more likely to end upwith jobs like taxi driver or street worker; they are more likely to be nursesthan doctors. Malay women arguably have it worst. As Muslims, it seemed to me,their religion also makes them beholden to their fathers and husbands.So I was quite surprised to discover that, according to the latest survey datafrom Singapore, the Malays—especially middle-aged Malay wives (that diaphanousblur of pastels)—are the happiest of Singapore’s three ethnicities, which makesthem the happiest subculture in all of Asia.What’s going on here?The Malays, according to the World Values Survey, are slightly more familyoriented than the other ethnic groups and more likely to rank religion as themost important source of satisfaction in their lives. Nearly all Malays inSingapore are Muslims. One imam I met told me that the Koran urges its followersto be happy with what God has provided. This seemed to contrast sharply withwhat I’d seen of the Chinese acquisitive can’t-lose mentality. On the firstfestive day of Shawwal, Muslim Malays go from house to house to visit relatives.They catch up with old friends and distant relatives, patch up old disputes ifany have developed during the year, and exchange small gifts. By contrast,Chinese Singaporeans celebrate the new year by burning effigies and praying forgood luck and fortune. One group seems to focus on increasing social equity,while the other seems to emphasize increasing material equity. If this soundsoverly critical of the Chinese in Singapore, we should also recognize that, as agroup, they deserve a lot of credit for helping to build their nation’s economyinto one that provides everyone with the basics: adequate shelter, food, healthcare, ethnic harmony, and security—enabling all Singaporeans to pursue theircultural priorities with the knowledge that life’s necessities are covered.SECRET INGREDIENT—KAMPONG SPIRITWhen I met him, Ahmad Nizam Abbas was a 39-year-old attorney straddling twoworlds. On the one hand, he was born to a large Malay family that follows thetraditions of Malay culture and religion. On the other, he was educated inEngland and now works among largely Chinese businessmen who wear Prada suits,live in private condos, and work 70 hours a week. “Singapore has a big advantageover the rest of Southeast Asia,” he told me when I visited his 18th-floor lawoffice downtown. “Here, it’s a given that if you work hard, you’ll be rewarded.But for Malays there exists a perception that they’re not as hardworking asother groups or that their goals aren’t as lofty. The fact is, it’s not thatthey don’t want the better things, it’s just that they’re happy with whatthey’ve achieved. Achieving wealth is not an all-encompassing goal. If you go toa Chinese funeral, they have paper cars and a paper house at the wake. But at aMuslim funeral you’re just wrapped in a white cloth. You don’t bring it to thenext life.”The Malays have something called the Kampong Spirit, he said. “In the past, weused to live in fishing villages called kampongs, where we pulled together tohelp each other during times of adversity or disaster or during times ofcelebration, like preparing for a wedding. This notion still survives. When aMalay moves into a new flat, within a few days, other Malays in the neighborhoodwill quickly get to know them—this dates back to our fishing village roots. Ifsomething happens to a Malay household, within a few hours the whole Malaycommunity will be there to lend its support. It’s not that Malays have morefriends than Chinese, they just socialize more.”Compare wedding traditions, he continued. A typical Chinese wedding has 200 to400 guests, including immediate family members and business associates, andtakes place in a rented hall. He said, “You almost never see that with a Malaywedding because they need room for 2,000 guests, including not only family butdistant relatives and their friends. I may have not seen someone for six years,and I’ll get an invitation to go.”The More the Merrier--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Singaporeans really do have fun in large groups. Currently, they hold hundredsof mass participation world records including the largest laughing session, thelargest badminton rally, and the longest lantern parade.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Abbas also noted the Koran’s injunction to be happy with what God has provided—anotion that fits well on several levels with what we know about the fundamentalsof human happiness. Gratitude also comes into play; research shows that peopleare happier if they are grateful for the positive things in their lives, ratherthan worrying about what might be missing. Such an attitude would encourageMalays not to compare their wealth to that of their neighbors—a surefire way ofmaking themselves miserable.That was certainly the case with Norridah Yusoh, the 43-year-old housewife wemet in Chapter One. Every day she counted her blessings—her husband and threeschool-age children. As a middle-aged Malay wife, she fit the demographicprofile of the happiest Singaporean. She was also the veil-wearing Muslim womanwho knelt before her husband each night and guiltlessly begged his forgiveness.More than two years after I first met her, at the time of writing this book, Icalled her back on the phone. I reached her on a Saturday morning. In thebackground, I could hear the clinking of plates and the voices of teenagechildren. Her family was finishing breakfast. I wondered if she even rememberedtalking to me on a rainy evening in Singapore. “I remember you,” she said. “Youwere the American journalist who was so surprised to hear that I actually wantedto wear my headscarf.”“And do you remember what you told me when I asked you how happy you were?” Iasked.“Yes I do,” she replied snappily. “And I’m still a 9.5.”HAPPINESS ARCHITECTThree days before I was scheduled to leave, I hit the mother lode of Singaporeanhappiness wisdom. Despite all the warnings I’d gotten about how impossible itwould be, I managed to secure an interview with the famously media-wary Lee KuanYew—Singapore’s founding father. For three weeks I’d been working the phones,lobbying influential Singaporeans, and hounding Lee’s assistant. Then, oneafternoon, I called Lee’s assistant’s assistant and asked for an opportunity topresent my case in person. “After all,” I said, “this is a story abouthappiness, and we just want to profile the man responsible for it.” Theassistant told the other assistant, who told Lee, who said yes.Lee’s residence was fit for a founding father. In this high-density nation wherea 500-square-foot condo can run over a million dollars, he lives on a five-acrecompound. Despite the fact that Lee is generally revered in Singapore, a smallarmy of guards patrols the place. Entering vehicles are put through a rigoroussearch. We were stopped several hundred yards from his home and driven the restof the way in a government car.After 20 minutes in a waiting room, I was led into Lee’s sanctuary. Expecting astiff, formal interview with a cool disciplinarian, I was greeted instead by awarm smile from a man in casual slacks, loafers, and a Mister Rogers sweater. Amuted light illuminated his airy, wood-paneled office. Simple plum-blossomdrawings decorated the walls. On his spartan desk sat only an appointment bookand a computer. Missing were the many awards he’d received—the Woodrow WilsonAward for Public Service, London’s Freedom of the City award, and the Order ofSt. Michael and St. George. It was a space of contemplation more thanreflection. Late into his ninth decade, Lee retains a razor wit, and we’d barelybegun the interview before a soft chuckle broke the ice.We were sitting at a long meeting table next to Lee’s desk. His assistant pouredus green tea. I began by describing the World Values Survey and the WorldDatabase of Happiness and how they both point to Singapore as the happiest placein Asia.“But they never tell me yet,” he replied wryly. “They always tell me we aren’tdoing enough.”Lee and his team have often been credited with building one of the fastesteconomies the world has ever seen. (President Barack Obama recently praised Leeas a legendary figure “who helped to trigger the Asian economic miracle.”)Coincidentally, as we’ve seen, Lee’s team also seems to have created thehappiest population in Asia.“Were you thinking about laying the groundwork for a happy society when youfirst started planning Singapore in 1965?” I asked Lee. “Or were you just tryingto build a secure state?”“It was simpler than that,” Lee said. “I had to make it work or we’d all die.Never in the history of man had an island, which was the center of the BritishEmpire in this part of the world, seen its masters leave and become independent.They’d allowed Malaysia to be independent in 1957, but they’d kept Singaporeback. They wanted it as a military base for eastern Suez. By the time theyallowed us to rejoin Malaysia in 1963, the political demographics had alreadysettled in favor of the Malays, who were over 50 percent there. Therefore it wasgoing to be a Malay Malaysia.“By our entry into the federation, it became 40 percent Malays, 40 percentChinese, and 20 percent Indians and others. In other words, a rainbow coalitionfor a government. They did not want that.”“But you had a different vision,” I said.“Yes, so they asked us to get out. So this little island with no resources hadto survive. The greatest driving force was to find a way to make ourselvesrelevant to the world, and in that way we survived. We had to be of relevance tothe world. That relevance was economics: Our efficiency, our ability to providea base for secure production, commerce, services, exploration of businessopportunities in the region, logistics, hubs, transportation of people andgoods, in every possible way.”“Did it turn out the way you hoped?” I asked.“It has turned out, in the end, better than I’d hoped,” he replied. “I could nothave foreseen the speed at which technology would globalize the world. With thecomputer, the satellite, it is possible to move machines, people, ideas, moneyat greater and greater speed with more and more convenience. That gave usopportunities. In other words, the world became our market and not justMalaysia.”“Somehow, Singapore was better able to leverage technology than elsewhere?” Iasked.“The Malays in Malaysia decided to abandon English and go back to Malay,” Leesaid. “We decided to keep English and also teach each group’s mother tongue,Chinese, Mandarin, Malay, whatever. That gave us an enormous advantage. We werelinked up to the world and the region. They are now trying to go back to Englishin Malaysia, but they’ve lost the teachers and they’ve lost a generation. It’svery difficult.”The decision to go with English probably also prevented increased rivalry amongthe ethnic groups in Singapore, I offered.“Absolutely,” he said. “At the time of independence, the Chinese Chamber ofCommerce came to see me, and they told me that we should have Chinese as thenational language. But I felt if we did that, we’d never have any progressbecause we’ll be quarreling all the time. Let’s choose a neutral language andnobody has an advantage, I said. English wasn’t the mother tongue of any of theracial groups. It was the language of government under the British and thelanguage of commerce. I did not foresee it would also become the language ofbanking, and of the Internet, so that was a bonus.”I wondered where he found his ideas for putting Singapore together. “Did you usesome previous model, or did you invent it or evolve it as you went?” I asked.“No, I don’t think I could have invented it,” he said. “I studied London first,how it went from the center of empire to the center of international commerce,without empire, how they transformed themselves. Then I studied Hong Kong, whichis similar to us, an island. They were under British rule, protection, andconnections, so they could do all kinds of things because the Bank of Englandcovered them. We had to create all these platforms ourselves. But that gave usan indication of where we could travel. I studied other places like Malta anddecided that wasn’t the way to go. They were living off British aid and thetourists. That wasn’t going to give us a future. So it was improvising all thetime, learning from other countries, and adapting these ideas in an eclectic wayto make it work in Singapore. It was trial and error.”“When you drive through Singapore at night, the city makes even New York looklike a village,” I said. “I’m wondering what you think about when you look atthe skyline of Singapore and what it used to look like when you were a youngman, and what is it today. How does that make you feel?”“It is a reflection of how the world has progressed,” he said. “If the world hadnot progressed in the way it did, we would never be what we are today. BecauseAmerica, Europe, Japan progressed, we were connected with them, their businesseswere based here. Aircraft flew in and out every day. You can go to anyrestaurant and ask for beef from Texas, France, if you like, Australia,whatever. We have become a center for all kinds of people and businesses. Whenyou see the skyline today, it’s not indigenous, if you cut off Singapore fromthe world, it will go back to the fishing village it once was. If you want anargument for globalization, as I told the first WTO [World Trade Organization]director, Singapore is the result of globalization.”“BASIC CULTURE” POLICIESAs I listened to Lee tell his story, it struck me that another factor that makesSingapore work is that key traditions have survived here. But I wondered howlong they would last. “Singapore has managed to adhere to its Asian values,despite its Western ways,” I said. “Do you think they’ll disappear in theyounger generation?”“It’s a risk,” Lee said, “because once we educate them in English, they becomemore westernized because they’re reading English, American, British, Australian,and Canadian, watching TV and films, and traveling the world. I think thewesternization of our people is an inevitable trend. I’m hoping the family andthe basic education will retain some core values.“We teach two languages. It’s a very heavy burden on the children, fromkindergarten upwards. If you’re Chinese, you learn English and Mandarin. Ifyou’re Malay, you’ll learn English and Malay. It gives them a sense of place,where they come from, of course, with the Malays, religion, Islam. That givesthem a certain anchor. With the Chinese, it comes with mother’s milk that youmust work hard. You must be thrifty. You must have a good education, and thenyou’ll be able to live a good life. Then you must look after your parents justlike your parents looked after you.“This is what I would call basic culture, not high culture, but basic culture,what you do, what you’re going to do, what is important, what is not importantin life, right and wrong. Of course, with personalization some of it getsoverlaid by westernization. For instance, the idea of putting your parents intoan old folks home, which was unthinkable before, has now become a necessitybecause you have husband and wife who both work, earning good livings. So who’sto look after the grandparents?“We are having this shift. I think it’s not just happening in Singapore. It’shappening in China, too. They’re also having two-income families.”“Does that worry you?” I asked.“It worries me in the sense that we’ve got to find a transition into a newequilibrium which is not too cruel to the old. They go into the old folks home,they’re isolated, and they’re lonely. They have no family support. Yes, a nurseor care worker will come and change your clothes and feed you, but it’s an emptylife. So it’s a problem. But there are two ways in which this is takingplace—one, sheer lifestyle. For instance, now women do not want to get marriedtoo early. Why should they? They’re educated. They’re marrying later and laterand having fewer children when they marry. Why? They want to see the world;they’re in a comfortable life. That’s a lifestyle change, partly economic, butpartly seeing how other people live. They travel the world; they’re educated inAmerica, Britain, and Europe. They say, ‘No, I want this kind of a life.’ As aresult we have a declining population. Luckily for us, there are a lot ofChinese from China and Indians from India who find Singapore attractive to comeand study, stay, and work.”Family Matters--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Family is at the center of social structure in Singapore. In this collectivistsociety, the term “family” includes not only those genetically related to eachother but also friends and neighbors. This extended support system allowsSingaporeans to thrive and care for one another in unique, encouraging ways.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------“So what do you think are the ingredients to Singaporean happiness?” I asked.“What we set out to do was create a society which was efficient, orderly, welleducated, cultivated, courteous, learning the arts, culture dance, music, etcetera, not just making a living and caring for each other,” he said. “So we goout of our way to make sure we don’t have an upper class. You won’t see beggarsin Singapore. You won’t see ghettos in Singapore. It’s by conscious effort. Weknow there is a lower five to ten percent of the population that cannot keeppace with modern life, at the speed with which we are progressing. So we have tocarry them and make sure that they have a home. In fact, we more or less givethem a flat so that they’re not out in the streets. We find them some work. Wemake sure they have jobs. If the job doesn’t pay enough, then we subsidize theutility bills, the conservancy charges, all the services that must be rendered.The alternative is to have them out on the streets.“At the same time, we are very hardheaded in that we don’t subsidizeconsumption. We subsidize education, housing, and then we give you assets. Ifyou want to spend them on transportation, on sweets, candy, whatever it is, hereis your charge, you sell it, you spend it, and you’re poorer off. But we findthat if we give them assets, they keep it because they want to have them fortheir old age and also to bequeath to their children. We refuse to givesubsidies for consumption. We give subsidies where it is essential to give thema competitive edge—education, health, housing. Those are basics that enable afamily to grow up healthy, educated, and able to hold jobs.”“I think sometimes the key to happiness isn’t necessarily the easiest route,” Isaid. “I would love to have one more question: Are you happy?”“Happiness to me is a state of mind. If I’m happy and relaxed and don’t fretabout the future, then I think the future is going to become very cloudy. Youhave to be fairly comfortable with the present. Fretting about unexpected thingsthat can happen or trends, which are going to overcome you and you’ve got tomeet them. For instance, way back in the late eighties we already saw China wasgoing to be a problem, sucking away investments from the region and from us. Sowe then quietly moved into areas where we thought they would not be able tocompete with us for a long time, which is intellectual property,pharmaceuticals, life sciences. You don’t want to go someplace and have yourlatest discoveries come out as genetic engineering. We have moved into thoseareas. For them to change the system, the rule of law, reclamation of propertyrights, law of contracts, that’s going to take them one or two generations.Theirs is the rule of whoever is the government or magistrate, or the officer incharge. We moved into those areas where we believed it would take some time tobe able to compete on the same platform. Even once everything was functioning,we could see that we were going to run into difficulties.”“So when you think to yourself, ‘I want to have a relaxing afternoon,’ what doyou enjoy?” I asked.“I enjoy a stroll in the park, in the gardens, and a swim before dinner,” hesaid.“Simple things,” I remarked.“You have to be engaged with the world,” Lee said. “Yes, I know Singapore, butit’s changing. Yes, I know America, but every time I go there it’s changed, newpeople, new leaders, and new enterprises. Life means impermanence. That’s aBritish axiom: There’s nothing permanent in life. No living thing is permanent.If it’s permanent, that means it has no life. That’s the challenge of life. Areyou able to keep on adapting to your changed environment?”“Why is that so hard for people?”“Because you become complacent, and you resent leaving your comfort zone,” hesaid.“Don’t you think that’s the default position of most people?” I asked.“Yes, it is. But you’ve got to overcome that,” he said. “That’s the problem withgoverning a country. You’ve got to change policy, and suddenly you’ve got totell large chunks of the population. At the present moment, about 20 to 30percent of our population did not get an education that enables them to do thekind of jobs that we now get. They never finished high school. That’s a problem.We tell them, ‘You’ve got to go learn another skill.’ So from sitting on thefactory floor doing assembly jobs, all right, you’ll ride this thing and cleanup the floor. So we create jobs for them. It’s a challenge, but what’s thealternative? They do nothing, and we just pay them a living allowance? You’llboth go down the drain. If you work, you might not get as much as you didbefore, but we’ll make up the difference. We call it workfare, not welfare. Wehave seen what happens to countries that go for welfare. It becomes a blackhole. Even Sweden now has decided to pay 51 percent of their income in taxes tospread across the population. So we say I’ll give you this, but you work. Youearn your keep, and I will ‘top up.’ It’s a problem. They would prefer that thecompanies don’t move to China, Vietnam, or India. But how can it be, becausewe’ve got to move on to higher-skilled jobs, which they cannot do, but theiryounger brothers, cousins, or children can do. We’ve got to look after them.”“I have the feeling that the younger generation doesn’t have the appreciation orthe discipline that the earlier generations had to build a nation,” I said.“They seem to demand more freedom.”“The problem, which is not unique to us, it’s happening with the Japanese,” Leereplied. “Their younger generation is not as dedicated as salarymen as theirparents were. But I think when push comes to shove, they will exert themselvesbecause there’s something in the depths of their subconscious that says, ‘Youcan’t take this lying down.’ So I believe that when push comes to shove, themajority will say, ‘We can do it. Our fathers did it. Our brothers did it. Let’sdo it.’ But when everything is going fine, they say no. It’s a problem. Everyfestival day I see $100,000 to $200,000 worth of fireworks. I would never dothat. I’d build a club. I’d build a little dispensary or clinic. But for 20minutes you see this spectacle in the sky or on your TV, and then we’ll give youcomputer graphics. That’s the only way to attract the crowds at the marina. Theyounger generation says, ‘We can afford it. Let’s burn it up.’ It still hurtsme.”ENGINEERING HAPPINESSAs we started to wrap up the interview, I told Lee about a few expeditions I’dled years ago to look into the collapse of civilizations such as the Maya andthe Anasazi. Some experts have speculated that, right before the collapse, therewas a period of prosperity when people forgot the hard work and the disciplinethat had gotten them where they were. “Do you think that might happen inSingapore?” I asked him.“It’s difficult here,” he replied. “They know that this is a very small islandon which an enormous superstructure is erected. If we don’t tend to itregularly, this whole thing comes to a halt. You can’t go back to your paddyfields. There aren’t any paddy fields. This island started off with 120fishermen in 1819. Now there are 5.1 million.”“Do you feel pride when you think about that, that you were the man, with thelittle spark in your brain, and a lot of hard work?”“I wouldn’t say that. I may have presided over it. I may have pushed certainmajor thrusts, but there was a whole team that did many things to put flesh onthe bones, and then the people worked hard to get us there,” Lee said. “If theydid not learn, if they did not stretch from their native languages into English,learn to be engineers, architects, accountants, whatever, we wouldn’t have madeit. Yes, we created the schools, the polytechnics, the universities; we sent ourbest students abroad to the best universities in the world. But it was theireffort.”“If you would ask Singaporeans, ‘Why do you think this place is happy?’ they’llalmost always say security,” I said. “This is a secure place. I’m wondering howimportant you think strict laws are.”“It’s not just strict laws,” he said. “Strict law enforcement and certainty ofdiscovery and punishment. There are other Asian countries where you can bekidnapped, ransomed, shot, killed, and carnapped, everything. And yet our peoplego there because it’s cheap? Why is it cheap? It’s a different environment. Andit’s lawless.”“But you’re clear in your mind that strict laws and enforcement deter crime,” Isaid.“Absolutely. Look, to have that you must have an incorrupt administration. Onceyou have a corrupt administration, police force, officers, it goes down thedrain.”“So you’re saying once it’s broke, you can’t fix it.”“No, I’m not saying that. Once it’s broke it is very hard to fix it, but it canbe fixed if you’re determined and you push it right down. You have to start atthe top and go down. You can’t catch the people at the bottom and expect it toend as long as it’s going on at the center or the top.”“You had the advantage of building a nation from the bottom up,” I said.“We had the advantage first of an immigrant population,” he clarified. “Theyhave left their secure moorings—China, India, Indonesia—and they have come hereto make good. So they are more willing to change than people in their owncountries. Immigrants and first-and second-generation descendants of immigrantsare willing to try new forms to succeed. The Chinese have not succeeded ingetting them to stop spitting. It’s an ancient Chinese tradition. Hong Konghasn’t stopped it, but we have.”“Because the population is more malleable.”“Because the population is an immigrant population. You’ve come here to makegood. You’ve left your family, your homeland. To make good you’ve got to have asecure place where people will find it attractive to come and do business andbase their operations here. You’ve got to provide that kind of atmosphere,ambiance, and these conditions. If you start spitting and acting in a ThirdWorld way, then you are a Third World country.”By now, we had finished our tea. I looked around at Lee’s airy office again andwas struck by its complete absence of clutter. How suitably his own approach towork captured the very notion he was describing—living out the values he foundimportant. In the course of an afternoon’s conversation, he did not mention thepleasures of raising a family, or pride in the fact that his son had succeededhim as prime minister. That might be viewed as a common conceit of theultrasuccessful, except that my interviews with other Singaporeans progressedalong similar lines. It is a culture, for better or worse, where personal andprofessional identities tend to merge, where careers or businesses becomeall-consuming. I rounded off the interview by asking Lee about himself. Did theenvironment of well-being he created for Singapore work for him? I asked him torate his happiness on a scale of 1 to 10.“Personally,” he said after a moment’s reflection, “when I was prime minister Iwould say 5. Now I would say 6 because I don’t have that day-to-day fret.”“And what would it take to get to 9?”“Nothing would take me to 9,” he said. “Then I would be complacent, flabby, andwalk into the sunset.”THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EAST AND WESTI came away from my interview with Lee with a better understanding of how, whenit comes to perceiving happiness, some important factors appear to be cultural.To oversimplify things somewhat, Westerners seem to value freedom andindividualism, while Asians seem to value respect for elders, a striving forharmony, and a zeal for hard work and making the family proud—a legacy perhapsof Confucius, the fifth-century B.C. Chinese philosopher. Such values are notunimportant in the West. They just don’t seem to be etched as deeply as they arein what you might call the collectivist psyches of Asians. For Asians, strivingfor personal happiness appears to be a vaguely impolite and selfish concept thatfalls somewhere near the bottom of a list of lifetime goals.For Asians, the individual exists only in the context of his family andcommunity. The individual is not separate. He is often driven toward perfection,but not for personal gain as much as to live up to societal expectations, and tomake his mother proud. For Westerners, on the other hand, happiness is aboutpersonal achievement, freedom, and independence, rather than fitting in andmarching in step. For Asians, happiness is defined by society rather than byindividual expectations. If you fail to live up to what everyone else perceivesas happiness, you are therefore unhappy. Furthermore, personal happiness canonly get in the way of social relationships. By flaunting your bliss, you couldcreate jealousy and social disharmony. That’s why, for many Asians, personalhappiness is “incomplete” happiness, because it comes at the expense of socialharmony, which means it just isn’t worth it. Life is just better when there is aclear, socially determined path to follow, and you follow it. If Americans areencouraged to “follow their bliss,” then Asians are wary about the possibledownside of finding it.Millionaires Club--------------------------------------------------------------------------------In 2008, Singapore had the highest concentration of millionaires in the world,with 8.5 percent of the country’s households owning more than $1 million,according to the Boston Consulting Group. Additionally, as a group, Singaporeanstotal their assets at well over three and a half times the gross domesticproduct.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lee understood this. He and his clutch of advisers had created a society thatenabled Singaporeans—and, to a certain extent, Asians—to excel. Given the natureof their cultures, he sensed that Singaporeans would accept a broad range ofrestrictions in return for physical and economic security, along with thepromise of collective success. And he was right.Just as good courts and regulatory systems were needed to encourage capitalinvestment in Singapore, Lee had told me, strict laws were needed to keep thestreets clean and to break the population of what he called the “ancient habit”of spitting. Some of the restrictions that seemed obsessive, like the rulesagainst gum chewing, were necessary, he argued. And though foreigners might feelqueasy about that way of doing business, Lee reasoned that they would almostcertainly not bring their capital or businesses to an island that was unsafe,unpredictable, or unsanitary. So he and his team went out of their way toeducate Singaporeans so that everyone not only knew the rules, but also knew thereasons for those rules. They cleared all the obstacles for people to seek agood education, to get a good job, and to master their task. Then he putpolicies in place to provide for elders.Perhaps the time has now come, I thought, for a new generation of Singaporeanswho can not only maintain the best of the core values from the past but alsoadapt to Western influence without getting sucked into a vortex of materialism.I thought of people like Ahmad Nizam Abbas, who worked all the time but stillmanaged to attend every Malay wedding, or Jennie Chua, who personified thepursuit of the almighty five C’s but now spends much of her time volunteering.Of the people I met in Singapore, though, the one who impressed me the most asan example of Singapore’s potential future was a happy sushi king.A NEW BRAND OF HAPPINESSHis name was Douglas Foo. I met him for breakfast one morning at the SheratonHotel. He had an eager-to-please smile and a round face with thick lips. In mynotebook I wrote, “emanates joy like the full moon radiates light.” He worepermanent-press slacks, simple black shoes, and a bottom-of-the line Rolex thatpeeked out the cuff of his pinstripe shirt. “I’m the product of a strictupbringing,” he said when I asked about his personal history. “Once, I got sickat school and called my father to ask for a ride. Instead of coming to get me,he chided me for wasting ten cents on the call and told me to walk home. That’show I learned the value of money.” Later, after high school, he tutored for 18hours a day, in two-hour sessions, on his days off. He amassed $50,000, which heinvested in a clothing factory, but soon he discovered that the Chinese could doit for cheaper.Realizing that he’d be better off building a brand that he could own andcontrol, he founded Sakae Sushi “to create a unique, high-quality, andinexpensive sushi dining experience for his wife,” as his promotional materialsassert. When he opened his first sushi restaurant in 1998, he printed out themenu on his computer at 4 a.m. the day of the opening. He was sushi chef,waiter, dishwasher, and cashier. His gimmick was a two-way conveyor belt thateliminated the need for servers. The restaurant was high-tech, with interactivescreens at tables and slick decoration. People liked the fact that they couldchoose the sushi they wanted when they wanted it. No waiting to be served. Heopened his second shop four months later, and his business rocketed from there.The chain grew quickly to more than 100 restaurants. Today, Foo has more than1,000 employees in Singapore alone. I sat in on a meeting one afternoon when heand his team were going over procedures for employees opening restaurantsabroad. The meeting had the chatty ambiance of a Sex and the City luncheon withBig Brother Boss overseeing things. At one point, the head of Chineseoperations, a serious, erudite woman of perhaps 30, asked for suggestions abouta new sushi product that would appeal to the Chinese palate.“How about chop suey sushi?” quipped one manager.Led by Foo, the entire room burst out laughing. He had a big, openmouthed laughthat he delivered boldly with his head cocked back. Then, if someone looked athim, he’d laugh even harder. You could see his molars. Instead of acting likethe all-knowing, must-win corporate chairmen of Lee’s generation, Foo solicitedinput from his employees, who used words such as “compassionate” to describehim. He established a clever business model, peopled it with young, energeticemployees who found purpose in the intersection of raw fish and emergenttechnology, and got behind those people to help them succeed. Rather then actingas a leader who marched out in front, he led from behind in the role of anenlightened servant.After work, Foo typically attended fund-raisers or club meetings. In addition tobeing a Rotarian, he served on the board of several charitable organizations,including one that met the needs of seniors in his community. On the rare nightwhen he had no commitment, Foo went home. Unlike the business titans of anearlier generation, who were more likely to spend their free nights unwinding inthe brothel-like karaoke bars, with their giggling, eager-to-please waitresses,he’d go home and wrestle with his children. Or stay up late talking to his wifeabout the family or seeking her advice in business. The next morning he’d try towrestle with his kids again before school.When I had first called Foo, he’d told me that, despite all his successes, hewas only just an 8.5 out of 10 on the happiness scale. “I’m still on the firstrung of the ladder to success,” he’d said. “My perspective on life is that20,000 days are not much. I intend to do as much as possible during that time.But early in my career, I was so consumed with work, I seldom saw my son. I wasworried that one day when I got home from a trip, he would call me ‘uncle.’ Ididn’t want that to happen. So I was there when my son swam his first stroke. Iwas there for his first day of school and when he graduated from kindergarten. Iknow how important kids are, and nothing will keep me from attending to them,not even business.”At the end of the day I spent with Foo, he invited me to dinner. It was 10 p.m.,and he took me to a high-end place I call the High Altar of Sushi. He’d invitedhis wife, a stunning beauty, and one of his assistants. In a long, narrowprivate dining room, we sat at a teak table illuminated by candles. We startedwith a sushi mound atop shaved ice, or sea urchin, scallops, and toro tuna. Thenwe moved on to a soup with a white Japanese tuber and seaweed, and then on tothe main course of Alaska king crab tempura, prawns, another plate of searedKobe beef, and seared foie gras. We finished with a montage of desserts,including tofu cheesecake and spiced sherbet. It was a feast, with a shot oftop-shelf sake accompanying each course.“You work like a dog but live like a king,” I said to Foo at the end of themeal.“I never worked a day in my life,” he corrected me. And then, sensing the ironyof his reply, he tilted his head back, pinched his eyes closed, and unleashedone of his volcanic laughs. I didn’t exactly see the humor in it, but to sitacross the table from this young, high-powered executive positively quaking withglee, I couldn’t help but laugh myself. When he settled down and opened his eyeto see me laughing, it sent him right back into another paroxysm of joy. At thatpoint, I noticed a warm trickle running down my face as I literally,involuntarily, cried tears of happiness.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lessons from SingaporeDouglas Foo, in many ways, epitomizes a new kind of happiness in Singapore, onepropelled by tradition but tempered by modern forces. So what can Singapore—aplace engineered to be a utopia of sorts—teach the rest of us about happiness?Perhaps when it comes to policy, maximizing freedom does not maximize collectivehappiness. In Singapore, at least, a system has emerged that provides an almostcomforting degree of certainty to its citizens: Here are the rules. Follow them.Work hard and you will succeed. Pursuing the good life may indeed provide somereal, if fleeting, level of happiness. And it requires a certain economicbaseline for us to really enjoy the things that matter: family, relationships,and spiritual groundedness. No wonder, here, that happiness and success havebecome so tightly intertwined.Security Is EssentialIn Singapore you’ll find security cameras glaring at you constantly, and caralarms shriek if you exceed the speed limit. The canings and hangings seemdraconian, but Singapore’s politicians are adamant that such strict rules havebeen key to the country’s economic success. Of the more than two dozen people Iinterviewed, all cited security as the most important factor in Singaporeanhappiness. Daniel Nettle, author of Happiness: The Science Behind Your Smile,theorizes that we are predisposed by evolution to favor safety over freedom.“The caveman who worries about where he’ll get his next meal, finding a mate,and about the potentially dangerous tribe that lives over the hill is far morelikely to get his genes into the next generation than the caveman who runs freeand sits by the campfire,” he writes. In modern-day Singapore, security hastranslated into a general acceptance of strict criminal laws and restrictionsnot just on the media, civil rights, and some religious practices—ChristianScientists and Jehovah’s Witnesses are regarded as cults—but also on politicalopposition. But how do you justify the barbaric practice of caning, or ofhanging a man if he’s caught with a half ounce of heroin? A recent happinessstudy conducted in Afghanistan found that people living in areas with a moderateTaliban influence were actually happier than those outside the Taliban’scontrol. After decades of war and turmoil, ordinary people craved security somuch, they seemed to be willing to put up with the Taliban’s heavy hand. Whichsuggests, as the Singaporean example clearly demonstrates, that, under certaincircumstances, security can be more important to human happiness than evenfreedom. Or conversely, as the Buddhists say, maximum happiness does not meanmaximum freedom.Policies of “Basic Culture”Lee Kuan Yew built his country on the ideals of basic culture over high culture.He set out to create a society that was efficient, orderly, well educated, andcourteous with an appreciation for the arts and for citizens who cared for oneanother. Then he went out of his way to minimize an upper class. His policiesfavored thrift, education, health care, support for seniors, and developmentover consumption and blind growth. So every citizen’s basic needs would becovered. In general, tax policies encouraged investment. Educational policiesencouraged self-improvement. Social policies encouraged work. Unemployment, asure cause of unhappiness, was largely nonexistent. Other policies that favoredwell-being: * subsidizing home ownership to foster financial security and community stability * making quality primary, secondary, and university education accessible and affordable to everyone * taxing consumption of luxury goods like Swiss chocolate and Japanese gadgets * addressing poverty with “workfare” instead of welfare. In accepting that some proportion of the population is going to need help, be willing to create jobs to give the otherwise idle poor something to do. * “topping up” minimum wages with government subsidies so that all workers make a living wage * offering top pay for high-ranking government officials to attract highly educated talent and to discourage corruption * providing tax incentives to keep seniors living in their children’s homes or neighborhoodsStrive for Status EqualitySingapore, despite its great wealth, is largely a middle-class society. Over 84percent of the population lives in privately owned, government-built housing.Lee astutely made English the country’s lingua franca. He made sure all raceshad equal access to education and jobs. The result was de facto homogeneity thathelped Singapore’s society run more smoothly and happily. While ethnic andreligious differences have become lightning rods for dissent and violence inneighboring Philippines and Indonesia, ethnic harmony has been praised as one ofthe best parts of living in Singapore.Build an Environment of TrustCreating an environment of trust should be one of government’s top goals. InDenmark, we saw trust flowing from a population of white Lutherans bonded by acommon history and common values. Lee Kuan Yew’s government manufactured trustamong disparate immigrants with different cultural traditions by establishing acommon language and strict laws. And he created that environment from the topdown. Ministers were paid in excess of a million dollars a year to reduce thetemptation of corruption. Singapore has also invested heavily in making peopleunderstand the rules, the consequences of breaking them, and the certainty ofenforcement. On the flip side, Singaporeans trust the police, the courts, and,by and large, the government. As a result, it’s easier for the country toattract foreign businesses and to keep them there.Live Your ValuesPerhaps the most provocative person I met in Singapore was a comedian namedKumar, a transvestite known for his barbs about local frustrations andlifestyles. “We’re like puppets,” he said of his countrymen. “We’re groomed tofollow the rules, and now we just do it blindly.” Although he appears on stagein a dress, Kumar was wearing a canary yellow tank top, tight white slacks, anddark shades the day I interviewed him at his apartment. At first, theauthorities tried to prohibit his comedy show, he said. But eventually theydecided to just ignore him, despite his sly use of Singlish—a creole dialectcombining Chinese, Malay, and English—to poke fun at the shallowness of islandlife.“All we do in Singapore is eat, shop, and do hair,” he said.Though Singapore may still be far from a wide-open democracy, the youngergeneration may be less interested in the 70-hour workweeks and strict codes ofbehavior that their parents and grandparents lived by. Perhaps as they move intopositions of authority, the government will tolerate more freedom of expressionabout its values.However you sum up Singapore, values count. When I asked Dr. Ronald Inglehart,director of the World Values Survey, what the most important determinant ofhappiness was, he told me unequivocally, “The ability to live out your values.”For more than 40 years, Lee’s government has created an environment where peoplecan live out their values about providing for their families and living up tosociety’s expectations. Singapore has offered a system that neatly—oftenrigidly—defines an individual’s place in society. It also provides the ethnicstability, personal security, and economic freedom for people to find the placethat best suits their values. For the Chinese in Singapore, Lee told me, “hardwork comes with mother’s milk.” The lessons learned are clear: Set yourpriorities and your values, and try to live your life through that lens.That said, values are shifting in Singapore. The happiest people in Singaporetoday seem to be those who have chiseled time out of their overbooked days fortheir children and spouses. They volunteer to help others and seem to get morefrom the experience than just a status bump.So what can Singapore teach the rest of us about happiness? Perhaps when itcomes to policy, maximizing freedom does not maximize collective happiness.Unless we feel safe and secure, we’ll never be able to pursue the other aspectsof living that give rise to genuine happiness: family, relationships, andspiritual groundedness.Then again, as Kumar says, maybe all we really need is a good hairdo.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURMEXICO:The Secret Sauce of Happinessimage [Images/142.jpg]Felipe Gutierrez Gutierrez shares a laugh with family gathered around theirkitchen table in the mountain village of Potrero, Mexico, where a unique brandof humor lightens a sometimes heavy load of daily challenges. PHOTO BY DAVIDMCLAIN/AURORAMexico:The Secret Sauce of HappinessThe Chihuahuan Desert reaches across northeastern Mexico like a giant amoeba,gobbling up 140,000 square miles of the states of Chihuahua, Durango, Coahuila,and Nuevo León. If you were to stand at the edge of Laredo, Texas, and looksouth all the way to where the blue dome of the sky meets the shimmering, rustybrown horizon, this is what you would see: a rocky expanse dotted with cactus,creosote, peyote, and mesquite, cut by jagged basins and etched with trace roadsused by cattle herders and narcotraficantes. It’s the sort of terrain thatstings your eyes like a sandy wind. Every year, tens of thousands of would-beimmigrants make their way across this desert in search of a better life to thenorth. Many perish under the unforgiving sun. Farther south, the desert extendsanother 200 miles to the Sierra Madre Oriental and Mexico’s giant industrialcapital, Monterrey, a region known for breweries and cement factories. It’s notthe kind of place that suggests comfort, prosperity, or superlatives. Whichmakes it all the more surprising that, according to the best scientific data,this part of Mexico is the one of the happiest pieces of real estate in theentire Western Hemisphere. In fact, when asked by researchers, 59 percent of thepeople here rate themselves as “very happy.”“That’s about 24 percent more than in the U.S.,” said Ronald Inglehart, apolitical scientist at the University of Michigan and director of the WorldValues Survey.Where does all that happiness come from?To begin my search for answers, I flew to Mexico City to talk with the nation’sleading experts. I was met at the airport by Jesús Lopez, a local photographerknown as a master at handling logistics. He had agreed to moonlight on my behalfby setting up interviews and helping me get around. As he greeted me in theterminal, he offered a warm handshake and a mischievous smile. A short,middle-aged man with shiny black hair, platform shoes, and an untucked,body-hugging dress shirt, he looked like a cross between George Lopez and Dennisthe Menace. After a long exchange of pleasantries, we got down to business.“So, where do we go first?” I asked, figuring we’d hit the road running.He looked at me blankly. “I don’t know,” he replied with a shrug. “Don’t youknow?”I took this as a sign of things to come.We hailed a taxi and sped through the holy chaos of Mexico City’s rush hour withits oppressive humidity, din of honking traffic, and aroma of meat tacos andtailpipe exhaust. Next to me, Jesús frantically worked two cell phones to set upthe first interviews. I’d hoped to spend the first week of my stay in Mexicotalking with experts. But now, watching Jesús, I assumed I’d spend the first fewdays aimlessly touring the city.THE SUN BONUSBut I’d underestimated Jesús. By the next morning, he’d arranged appointmentswith most of the people on my list. We headed first to a think tank, the LatinAmerican Faculty of Social Sciences (FLACSO), located on a peaceful, leafycampus on the edge of the city. There we looked up a political scientist namedBenjamin Temkin, who had taped a note on his office door with a quote from W. C.Fields: “I am free of all prejudice. I hate everyone equally.”A middle-aged academic in a tweed jacket with a fringe of brown hair on hisbalding dome, Temkin greeted us with a smile. Just before we arrived, he’d beenworking on a spreadsheet of data from the World Values Survey, the World HealthOrganization, and Latinobarómetro, a Chile-based periodical study of attitudestoward democracy, trust, and other issues pertaining to Latin America. “I lovespreadsheets,” he said when he caught me looking over his shoulder at hisscreen. As an exercise, he’d been comparing the average annual temperatures in40 capital cities around the world with the suicide rates in each country (thelatter is a factor generally thought to be inversely related to happiness). Itwas a clever idea. His analysis clearly showed that the colder the climate, thehigher the suicide rate, with Lithuania topping the list with 31 suicides per1,000 people, and Mexico at the bottom with only 4 suicides per 1,000 people.You might conclude from this that the colder the country, the more people killthemselves, he said. (Perhaps the additional hours of darkness are depressing.)But it would be premature to do that, he warned.Mexico Facts--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Region: North AmericaLocation: Bordered by the United States, Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean Sea,Belize, and Guatemala.Population: 109.6 million people--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Sun Bonus--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Being happy can be as simple as stepping outside on a sunny day. The sunprovides us with vitamin D, also known as the “happiness vitamin,” whichnaturally increases the levels of the feel-good chemical serotonin in the brain.Doctors often prescribe sunlight to their patients who suffer from seasonaldepression during the winter months.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------“What we can conclude with certainty is that Mexico and indeed all countriesnear the Equator enjoy something we could call the sun bonus,” he said. “Allthings being equal, places with sunnier weather are slightly happier than theirnorthern cousins.” This was important to understanding Mexican happiness, hesaid. By most measures Mexicans should be rather unhappy. On the world rankingof the Human Development Index (HDI), a widely accepted measure of “objective”well-being that takes into account the levels of income, education, and healthcare, Mexico ranks somewhere in the middle at 53rd. That’s because about 60percent of its population are poor and about 20 percent live in conditions ofextreme poverty, and, as the index generated by the World Value Surveyssuggests, on the average, richer, healthier, more highly educated people tend tobe happier.But not so with Mexico.When it comes to happiness, Mexico ranks second in the World Values Survey, wellahead of the United States, western Europe, and other developed nations!Mexicans, in other words, seem to have developed a secret sauce that makes themhappy, despite the drawback of, well, living in Mexico. “There’s a lot morehappiness here than the ‘objective’ standard of living would suggest,” Temkinsaid.According to some experts, a family of four in Mexico needs only about $320 permonth to satisfy its basic needs. Below that income level, people really suffer.Above that, more money does not buy much more happiness. In the United States,on the other hand, a household would need $5,000 per month to optimize incomeand happiness. That makes it look as if Mexico has “bought” its current level ofhappiness for a bargain price.“Of course the danger of this information is that politicians may interpret itto mean that they can say to poor people, ‘Okay, you don’t have education,health, or decent employment, but you’re happier than people in other countries,so don’t make trouble,’” he said. Temkin stressed that the fact remains that adecent level of health, education, and income constitutes a basic right ofpeople and is necessary to sustain both objective and subjective well-being.“Can you tell me why?” I asked.“Isn’t that your job to find out?”THE MEXICAN X-FACTORJesús and I spent most of the next two days trying to get a better sense ofMexico’s recipe for happiness. A few of the ingredients that I had assumed wereprerequisites for happiness—a trustworthy government, good health care, and adecent income—barely figured into the mix here. Sure, we might be able toattribute a small portion of Mexico’s sunny outlook to the sun itself. But thenHaiti and Sierra Leone are sunny, too, and they rank among the world’s leasthappy places. Something else is going on.To find out what that might be, I met a political scientist named Miguel Basáñezfor lunch in a Parisian-like café. Basáñez had suggested we meet at 2:30, whichseemed kind of late for a midday meal. But the trendy Rojo Bistro was buzzingwith the clinking of silverware, the staccato drone of business conversations,and the occasional burst of laughter from a table of smartly dressed youngwomen. Basáñez, with slicked-back gray hair and an aristocratic mustache, waswearing a charcoal suit with a Montblanc pen in his shirt pocket when he showedup late. “I’m sure you’re familiar with the Latin sense of punctuality,” he saidwryly as he sat down.Educated at the London School of Economics, Basáñez saw Mexico’s happiness as aproduct of both its culture and its recent history. For much of the 20thcentury, one political party—the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI)—ruledMexico. The PRI, launched in the aftermath of the Mexican Revolution to championthe rural and farming populations, soon had become the political machine ofleaders who proved to be neither by nor for the people. Holding tightly to thereins of power for decades, PRI leaders repressed dissent. In 1968, under thePRI’s watch, Mexican police massacred several hundred people, including studentswho were protesting the policies of President Gustavo Díaz Ordaz. When the PRIfinally lost the presidency in the 2000 elections, a sense of relief washed overthe nation. The Mexican people had finally gained the right to say who governedthem. And with that came a spike in happiness.During the heyday of the PRI, Mexicans had struck a Faustian bargain, Basáñezsaid. The people agreed to put up with one-party regime in exchange for a halfcentury of meteoric growth, during which Mexico transformed itself from a ruralto an urban society. But after a catastrophic earthquake hit Mexico City, thepeso was devalued, and banks were nationalized, the economic crisis came to ahead in the mid-1990s. Only when Mexicans felt a surge in freedom in 2000 did asurge of enthusiasm occur, aided by the NAFTA free trade agreement that gave aboost to the economy again.“So you think that freedom explains why Mexico is experiencing higher levels ofhappiness?” I asked.“Yes and no,” he replied. “Humans have a complex relationship with freedom.”Most happiness experts agree, said Basáñez, that for a society to flourish,certain conditions have to be met—a decent economy, basic social stability, andso on. In most countries, economic freedom seems to go hand in hand withhappiness: Societies thrive when their people can easily start businesses, getloans, and let their ingenuity and hard work breed success. Political freedomdoes not seem to matter as much; countries where people report high levels ofwell-being are not necessarily places where people are free to organize, tovote, and to provide input on how they’re governed.This is not the case for Mexico, Basáñez said.The number of Mexicans who say they feel free has soared since the PRI lost its80-year stranglehold on the presidency. “It turns out that despite its lowimpact on happiness elsewhere, political freedom is an important value forMexicans, and they are experiencing more of it lately,” he said.Basáñez thinks the Mexican X-factor—the secret sauce—probably has to do withdisposition and an emphasis on social life over dedication to work. When helived in New Jersey, Basáñez saw that people were in the office by 8 a.m. sharp,but when he tried to get co-workers out for socializing after work, they’d betoo busy. Or he’d get them out but they were available only until 9 p.m. sharp,and they’d go home. “I could call 30 friends right now for a party at home, andmost of them would come right away,” said Basáñez. “We’d drink and laugh allnight. And when we’re done, we’d be hugging each other saying that we love eachother. Of course, no one would be in the office tomorrow. The American system isgood for productivity but not for the soul. The Mexican system is good for thesoul but terrible for productivity.” Indeed, a recent study carried out byGallup-Healthways shows that social time massively affects day-to-day happiness.It suggests that for most people spending six to seven hours in social time eachday helps to maximize their well-being. And full-time workers do best with aboutnine hours of social time to maximize their happiness—even more if their jobsare stressful.“The secret,” Basáñez concluded, “has to do with maintaining just the righttension between making a living and savoring life.” By now our lunch hadarrived: shrimp capellini and a Napa Valley chardonnay.“Have you seen the surveys that show that the people of Monterrey are happierthan anyone else in Mexico?” I asked. “Do you think it’s true?”“You know,” he said, twirling pasta around his fork, “I never thought of it, butthat sounds right. People in the north, in general, are better off than the restof the country. They have better jobs, better health care, and better services.But remember, this is by Mexico’s standards, not the United States’. Northernershave a reputation for working harder than those in the south. So, while they mayhave a Latin sense of time urgency, they still work hard enough to cover thebasic standard requirements of happiness—food, shelter, health care, someeducation, and mobility—while enjoying life. They’re also more candid andreligious.”“Anything else?” I asked.Basáñez put down his fork, sat back, and closed his eyes. “This is not unique toMonterrey,” he replied after a long pause. “But Mexico has an amazing ability tolaugh in the face of the hardship and thereby make it more tolerable. We laughat sickness, poverty, and even death. We even have a holiday to celebrate death.November 2, the Day of the Dead, is one of the biggest holidays of the year.”LAUGH THERAPYOkay, time for a reality check. Before we skip too far down the primrose lane ofMexican happiness, we should acknowledge a few of the more obvious potholes.Mexico has one of the highest disparities between rich and poor in the world,for example. In the United States, someone in the top ten percent income bracketmakes ten times more money than someone in the lowest ten percent. In Mexico thewealthiest ten percent has more than twenty-five times the income of thepoorest.Then there’s the question of crime, with hundreds of police murdered each yearin ongoing drug wars and rampant kidnappings for ransom. The month I was there,two police chiefs in Nuevo León were assassinated, their bodyguard washandcuffed to a chain-link fence and shot in the head, and a journalist wasseriously injured when gunmen stormed the newspaper’s offices. And the drugcartels aren’t the only problem. The World Values Survey shows a broad distrustof the police in the country. Fifty-five percent of Mexicans said their level ofconfidence in the government was “not very much” or “none at all,” while theirlack of confidence in the police was even higher, with about 66 percentresponding negatively.One woman told me a story about being robbed at gunpoint in a bookstore. “Ididn’t even report it,” she said. “I knew that nothing would happen and I’d loseeight hours in the police station. Something like five percent of crimes areprosecuted. The police are abusive or inept.” She went on to describe one of herfamily’s long Sunday dinners (a concept known as sobremesa—lingering at thetable over a meal), when they discussed crime for the entire meal. “Everyone hastheir tale of robbery, housebreaking, or mugging,” she said.How do Mexicans cope? A popular joke suggests a clue: A contest was held to findthe most effective police force in the world. The test consisted of letting arabbit run free in the woods and seeing which police force could find the rabbitfastest. It took the FBI three hours to find their rabbit, the German policefound theirs in two, and Scotland Yard took only 90 minutes. After five hours,the Mexican police force hadn’t found their rabbit. An hour later, the Mexicansshowed up pulling a weeping and terrified elephant. The judges pointed out tothe Mexican police that this animal was not a rabbit. The elephant, overhearingthis, immediately fell to its knees and said, “I swear I am a rabbit, just don’thit me anymore!”To get a better feeling for Mexican humor and its role in the nation’s happinessrecipe, I tracked down Mexico’s most popular clown, a TV personality namedVictor Trujillo. Known to millions as Brozo the Creepy Clown, Trujillo haddonned a green wig and red nose every morning for almost a decade to deliver hismix of obscene humor, news, and political commentary on a show called ElMañanero (a double entendre meaning “morning quickie”). When I caught up withhim at the Univision studios in Mexico City, Trujillo broke out of a productionmeeting that looked more like a bunch of drinking buddies telling jokes and ledme into his small office. There, a huge, $75,000 fine art print of a wingedchild, from Gregory Colbert’s “Ashes and Snow” exhibit, hung over a neat,contemporary glass-topped desk and a new Apple computer—not the decor of yourusual clown. Indeed, I knew from my research that Trujillo’s methods contained acertain genius. He once prompted a corrupt city official to resign on livenational TV by playing a secretly taped video of the guy stuffing a $45,000bribe into his briefcase. Snickering under his green wig and red nose, Trujilloasked the official, “Can you comment on this video?”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Best MedicineResearchers at California State University studied the link between humor andlife satisfaction by bringing happiness and humor programming to seniorcitizens. Those who participated in the programming, which included interactiveactivities and joke telling, showed significant increases in self-reported lifesatisfaction.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------“Mexican humor is like laugh therapy on a national scale,” Trujillo told meafter we’d settled into our conversation. We’d been talking about the corruptionin the police force. “You Americans can believe in your police, we can’t. Herethey just add to misery.” Trujillo is a big man with a shaved head and rimlessglasses. This morning, instead of his clown suit, he was wearing a kelly greenwarm-up suit, New Balance sneakers, and two USB drives around his neck.“In Mexico, humor is not a vehicle to poke fun at people as it often is in othercountries,” he explained. “We don’t laugh at the Indians, or the blacks, or thegays. Here it’s something to give us space and time before we just get mad. Wedon’t have much power, so we laugh at those who do. It’s a balm against pain.”As he talked, he gesticulated excitedly, stretching his arms grandly to make apoint. Ridiculing those in power helps society to cope.“It does no good to cry, so we laugh,” he said.MEXICO’S POCKET OF HAPPINESSOver the next week, Jesús and I met with economists, social scientists, and ananthropologist. I learned that, statistically speaking, freedom of choice is thesingle biggest predictor of happiness—as well as a few roots of Mexicanhappiness that would make sense to me later. We decided it was time to fly toMonterrey and meet some of Mexico’s happiest people. When I met him in the hotellobby to leave for the airport, he was garbed in the kind of rhinestone-studdedT-shirt favored by L.A. rock bands.“You can forget about sleep for the next couple of days,” he warned.As our plane rose out of the rust-colored smog of Mexico City and headed north,the scene below looked like a giant transistor board—a wild circuitry ofavenidas and calles etched between seemingly endless low, cinder-block housing.About a hundred miles north into the trip, the urban snarl finally thinned andgave way to a patchwork of parched terrain hinting at agricultural activity.The flight took us past the jagged peaks of the Sierra Madre Oriental to thefoothills near Monterrey, a smaller, less chaotic version of Mexico City. Likeits bigger cousin, Monterrey looks chaotic, as if urban planning hadn’tsuggested itself to the city’s founders. Streets radiate from the central squarelike cracks in a window shattered by a hurled rock. Flanked by the green tuftsof parks and playgrounds, the Santa Catarina River loops through town. LaHuasteca, a miniature mountain range that looks like an enormous,crescent-shaped Bundt cake, hems the city to the west. To the east, houses thinout to scrubby desert and dusty ranchland. With a population of 1.1 million inMonterrey proper and a few million more spread around its suburbs, themetropolitan area is big enough to afford good schools, good parks, and otherbasic infrastructure without devolving into the crush that is Mexico City. Inmany respects, it looks more like Laredo, Texas, just two hours to the north bycar.History, it appears, favored Monterrey. The states of Nuevo León and Coahuilahave long been among Mexico’s most prosperous. The confluence of Europeansettlers, local skills, rural grit, and proximity to the United States has paidoff. The area’s per capita income of $14,000 is one of the highest in thecountry. When it comes to work and making money, the region seems to have founda sweet spot: tapping economic success without going overboard in pursuit ofwealth. Monterrey’s city motto, “Work tempers the spirit,” supremely sums upthis attitude.One might trace the roots of the region’s economic success all the way back toconquistador Hernán Cortés. After he sacked the Aztecs in the 16th century heawarded land in the north to a band of his men, many of them Jewish, and anallied group of Tlaxcala Indians. At first, the hot, barren landscape may haveseemed like a booby prize, a place of cactus and rock with slim potential. Butan independent-minded culture took root here, and it turned out to be morediverse and entrepreneurial than those in other parts of the conquered lands.Over the centuries, the region continued to attract immigrants, who built aneconomy based on cattle and cotton. The area’s unique culture combinedindigenous recipes and Jewish influences like samita, a bread baked with cheese,raisins, peanuts, and sugar; floral blouses and wide-brimmed hats; and polkabands alongside mariachis. Today, almost everyone here is a mestizo, of mixedheritage, with perhaps more European influences than indigenous ones. You’llfind plenty of locals with surnames like Valdez and Rodriguez, but the Muellersand Cohens remain part of the mosaic too.Nuevo León is also home to thriving steel, glass, cement, refining, and brewingindustries, the latter an outgrowth of German settlement in the area. Eighty-sixpercent of the land is used for raising livestock, while petrodollars haveaccelerated the region’s affluence. According to the Human Development Index,the state ranks highest in all of Mexico due to its strong economic climate andsophisticated hospitals, schools, universities, and infrastructure. But, as Ilearned during my first week in the area, this strong economy probably doeslittle to explain the region’s outsize happiness.SMALL DIFFERENCES, BIG RESULT“Family, health, and faith in God: These are what count most to people here,”said Nicole Fuentes, an economist at the University of Monterrey. Theuniversity, a cluster of modern buildings surrounded by green, manicuredgrounds, contrasts starkly with the prickly brown Sierra Madre foothills. Wewere sitting in the school’s cafeteria, surrounded by hundreds of casuallydressed (think Gap apparel) students who would have looked right at home in anycommunity college in South Texas. Fuentes herself was wearing blue jeans, Nikerunning shoes, and a white maternity blouse that was doing its seam-burstingbest to cover her soon-to-be-born daughter.A graduate of Columbia University, Fuentes had landed in Monterrey to study, ofall things, happiness. As a student, she became interested in using the tools ofeconomics—data and analysis—to understand what brings people satisfaction inlife. She had questioned the generally accepted rules that well-being increaseswith happiness and that gross national product is the best measure of nationalhappiness. In general, when you plot per capita income against happiness levels,you get an upward-sloping line that levels off at a certain income. As incomegoes up (to a certain point), so should happiness. But that’s not what you seein Monterrey. There the data form a flat scatter plot, more like a cloud ofdots. In other words, something else influences happiness there more than incomedoes.So if rising income didn’t create more happiness, she wanted to know, what did?Fuentes ticked off a long list of objective measures of happiness—things thatyou can easily measure: * Better education—Two of the best private universities in the country are located here: the Monterrey Institute of Technology and the University of Monterrey. Many private schools are bilingual. Teachers speak to students in English from nursery school on up. * Better medical services—A higher percentage of people have access to hospitals and medical care in Monterrey compared to other Mexican cities. * Geography—Monterrey is close to the United States. Proximity to goods and services favors people here. * Better government—Since the 1960s, Monterrey has had two strong political parties that alternate power (the region was the first to elect a mayor from the party that opposes the PRI). This translates into more competition and less corruption. * Better infrastructure—Bigger and better streets, an international airport, a subway line, lots of public parks, two football stadiums, and one arena.As part of her research into happiness factors—the ones that people themselvesreport—Fuentes listened to residents of Monterrey. In late 2002, she and herteam mapped out 80 blocks of the metropolitan area and polled hundreds of peopleto find out what they valued in their lives. After conducting some 574interviews about domains of life, Fuentes found that three out of four peopleconsidered themselves happy—an extraordinary proportion. When it came to money,she found that for a family of four, any income above $4,000 a year brought noadditional happiness. In fact, income ranked so far down the list of valuescited by residents that it was considered “trivial”—especially among the poorestpeople. Even 44 percent of the people who said they were dissatisfied with theireconomic situation still said they were happy overall with their lives. So, ifthese people in the happiest region of the happiest country in the WesternHemisphere believed that money played almost no role in their happiness, whatdid?“We found that about 80 percent of the people we polled believed in God and thatpeople who went to church at least once a week—about half of respondents—werethe happiest,” Fuentes said. Indeed, worldwide research shows that religiouspeople are happier than nonreligious ones. But in Mexico there are more happyreligious people than there are elsewhere.Family was also a factor, Fuentes said. Married people were most likely to behappy. Conversely, the least happy were men who had been widowed and women whowere divorced. Her research mirrored that of a European study in which subjectswere outfitted with a PDA that pinged them randomly and asked them to reporttheir mood. The study showed that they were in the most positive mood when theywere with family, followed by being with friends, and finally being alone.Beyond marriage, it was the expansive sense of family that seemed to explain anadditional happiness boost, she said.Fuentes herself grew up in the town of Puebla, south of Mexico City. She movedto Monterrey in 1998 after marrying a local lawyer. The two towns are about thesame size, but Fuentes notes a long list of contrasts that help explain whyMonterrey seems to have an edge over Puebla. The cultural life of Monterrey isricher, with more art galleries and theaters, she said. The International Forumof Cultures attracts new art and ideas to the region. Monterrey invests deeplyin public spaces, such as playgrounds. Walkways and bike lanes line majorstreets, making exercise easier. Fuentes specifically mentioned Paseo de SantaLucia, which resembles San Antonio’s River Walk. “These places are great becausethey are attractive, open to everyone, and you don’t need to spend time or a lotof money to enjoy them,” she said.But what struck her as well were the small differences in daily life that add upto something important. When she first moved to Monterrey, Fuentes said, it wasokay to leave your door unlocked at night, to drive with your car windows down,or to take a walk alone at night—a level of security, she said, many people inMexico did not enjoy. (Sadly, neither do people in Monterrey today, given itsrecent epidemic of crime.) Local investment in parks and recreational trailscontinues to mean that people—regardless of income—can enjoy the outdoors withtheir families. When Fuentes heard from friends in Puebla, by contrast, theyoften complained that the only place to take kids is the shopping mall. Shenoted a certain civic pride in Monterrey. For instance, in the holiday season,streets are decorated and holiday parades are held for children.“I was impressed the first time I went to the soccer stadium here,” saidFuentes. “Fans danced and sang the whole 90 minutes of the match. Nonstop.”(This observation made sense to me, especially in light of the local enthusiasmfor religion. As anyone who’s ever been to northern Mexico knows, soccer is justanother form of religion.) Finally, she said, people here are hard workers:“They work hard enough to get everything done, but not too hard that they missthe important things.”A REAL PANACEAOf the many insights into Mexican happiness that Fuentes offered from herresearch, the two that interested me most involved faith and family. On thesurface, both factors seemed obvious, so I wondered if there was somethingdifferent about Monterrey’s brand of the two. We know that religious people arehappier than nonreligious people, but does religion have a stronger impact inthis area of the world? As for family, it’s no surprise that we will all behappier if we’re in a good relationship with our spouse, are close to our kids,and love our parents. But are Monterrey families different from familieselsewhere? Is there something about them that could teach us how to thinkdifferently about our own families and how to spend our own time and resources?One Friday afternoon, I visited one of the neighborhoods where Nicole had doneher research, a working-class enclave called Santa Catarina in the shadow of themountains of La Huasteca. I walked up and down the largely quiet streets oftwo-story homes painted pastel pinks, greens, and blues, with tall wooden doorsand ornate iron-grated windows. Majestic Monterrey oaks arched overhead, theirleaves filtering the heat of a withering midday sun. The streets were quiet withthe serenity of the afternoon siesta, but in front of one house, I found threewomen sitting on cement blocks and chatting energetically.“Buenos días,” I said, and introduced myself. (I’m six feet three and speakSpanish with a powerful Minnesota accent, so that phrases like por supuesto—“ofcourse”—sound disquietingly like “Ya, you betcha.”) “I’m writing a book abouthappiness,” I blurted. “Do you mind if I talk to you?”The women looked up at me with an expression of terror. Or maybe disdain. But amoment later, Silva Idalia, a 60-something grandma wearing cutoff jeans and apink T-shirt, nodded in acquiescence. She introduced me to the other women, MariCastro and Christina Zavala, and told me that they were neighbors and friends.As we talked, their six school-age kids squealed with delight as they kicked ahalf-inflated soccer ball up and down the street.The three women met here every day after the midday meal, Silvia said. Theirhusbands, like most men in the neighborhood, earned modest incomes, perhaps $500per month, to support multigenerational households of seven to twelve people.The women stayed home, took care of children, cleaned, and made the meals.During the warm hours of mid-afternoon, they got together to gossip and tocomment on the state of the world. Christina, in her late 20s, lived with fiveadults, including her mother-in-law, an 8-month-old baby, and a pair of11-year-old cousins who helped her with chores. She went to church every Sunday.Once a year, on April 11, the anniversary of her grandmother’s death, about 60members of her extended family got together for a picnic at the grave.Gathering Joy--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman developed the “day reconstruction method” tomeasure people’s happiness during each part of the day. This unique way ofreporting happiness, in segments rather than as a collective whole, showed thatthe least happy time of the day was when people were alone (commuting to work orschool) and the happiest portions were with others (dinner with family orinteracting with friends).--------------------------------------------------------------------------------“And do you know all 60 of those people?” I asked.“Of course,” she said. “They are my family.”When I asked the women if they were happy, they shrugged and looked at oneanother. “Yes, we’re happy,” Silvia said, breaking the silence. “We could alluse a little more money, but we have what we need, and what we don’t have Godtakes care of.”“What would you do if you had more money?”“Probably buy bigger houses,” Christina said. “But on the other hand, weprobably wouldn’t meet like this every afternoon. So, maybe not.”It occurred to me that if they were better off and could afford to live in oneof the many new cul-de-sac developments going up on the edge of Monterrey, wherehouses are separated by wide lawns, these women wouldn’t see each other asoften. Here, in this neighborhood of shared challenges and easy camaraderie, allthat is needed for a pleasant afternoon are three cinder blocks and a limpsoccer ball.Leaving the women to continue their chatting, I wandered on down the street. Forthe rest of the afternoon, I took an informal poll on happiness with everyone Iencountered—three teenagers sitting outside a small grocery store, a womansweeping her sidewalk, a street vendor. None were too surprised to hear thatother people in the neighborhood said they were happy. “People know each otherhere,” said the woman with the broom.Late that afternoon, I noticed a group of five women carrying an appliance-sizeclear plastic box containing a statue of Jesus, his bloody heart wrapped in abarbwire of thorns. They were heading to their weekly prayer meeting at thehouse of a friend. Inside were gathered about 20 women, ranging from 20 to 70years old, to say the Rosary in a cramped, cement-walled, tiled-floor livingroom that was cooled only by a rotating fan. They were gathering this week topray for a friend who had just been diagnosed with cancer. It was a quiet,serious affair that made me feel like an intruder. When I asked the woman nextto me if she knew the women for whom we were praying, she shook her head no andshushed me.Following the prayers, the gathering segued into a social occasion, where therosary beads went into purses and Coca-Colas came out of the refrigerator.Prayer turned to easy gossip. The young woman who had cut me off during theprayers came up to me to apologize. “I come here every Friday because I know ifI get sick, this group will pray for me,” she said. “It gives me comfort.”Her comment reflects a common theme in surveys of Mexicans. Like people in theUnited States, Mexicans express a near-universal belief in God (95 percent inthe United States and 98 percent in Mexico). But when asked, “How important isGod in your life?” more than 80 percent of Mexicans responded with a 10 on ascale of 1 to 10—compared with only 58 percent in the United States. Nearly 59percent of Mexican respondents, moreover, said religion is “very important” intheir lives—compared to 47 percent in the United States. In Nuevo León, thenumbers are even more extreme. Here, in addition to traditional Catholicism,people practice a more potent blend of European and homegrown beliefs that tapsinto cultural traditions dating back to the time of the Aztecs.This spiritual blend is vividly illustrated by a cult surrounding José “El Niño”Fidencio, a clubfooted child who was believed to have a knack for thesupernatural. In 1906, at the age of eight, he reportedly laid his hands on hismother’s broken arm and the arm instantly healed. He then started using prayers,touch, and herbal medicine to cure people of everything from colds to muteness.By the time he was a young man living in the town of Espinazo, his reputationhad spread across Mexico. In 1928, Mexico’s president (whose earlier campaign tosuppress the Catholic priesthood almost got Fidencio arrested) sought El Niño’shelp for a skin condition. The boy famously snubbed the president beforeeventually seeing him. After he cured the ailing politician, thousands ofhopeful people descended on Espinazo. By the time of his death in 1938, El Niñohad become the most famous curandero in Mexico. Even today, 80 years after hisdeath, tens of thousands of visitors still descend upon Espinazo each year toremember him and to seek cures for just about everything that modern medicinecan’t address or that meager incomes won’t cover.Faith and Happiness--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Religion and faith are often linked to happier lives. However, according to EdDiener, author of the book Happiness, it’s religion’s broader lessons that leadto happiness—acting selflessly and morally, having a sense of purpose, findingmeaning in daily activities, and expanding positive emotions on a continualbasis.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------In another tumbleweed desert town 50 miles northwest of Monterrey, I met ElNiño’s modern counterpart, a diminutive 15-year-old girl named Adriana PérezAlaya. Known simply as La Niña, Alaya has also gained an internationalreputation as a child healer. Five years ago, as the story goes, Alaya met anold woman on her way to church. They exchanged a greeting, during which time thewoman told Alaya that she was suffering from stomach cancer and was going to diesoon. The ten-year-old simply put her hands on the woman and said, “You’recured.” The woman went home, and soon thereafter her stomach cancer was said tohave disappeared. News spread quickly throughout Nuevo León. Soon other sickpeople started showing up at Alaya’s door and camping outside her bedroomwindow. The demure child, whose parents had instilled in her a respect forelders, dutifully put her hands on the strangers, murmured a small prayer of herown invention, and sent them on their way.Within a year, dozens of miracle seekers were showing up in Paredón every day.They’d camp out under the fourth grader’s bedroom and mob her on her way toschool. Then they’d wait for her outside the school. Adriana’s parents tried toprotect her by serving as her bodyguards. But they were simple farmers, out oftheir league. Finally they took her out of school, turned an adjacent lot intoan ad hoc clinic, walled off their compound, and cloistered their daughter.The day I visited her, about 200 people had made the pilgrimage to see La Niña.The lime green walls of her family’s home were plastered with letters and photosof followers who had visited her, as well as newspaper clippings attesting toher miracles. There was a note in crayon from a nine-year-old girl who saidshe’d been cured of cancer. A typed letter from a man who said he’d beenrelieved of bone pain. A lock of hair Scotch-taped to a letter from a manthanking La Niña for curing his baldness. Inside, patients with everything fromrheumatism to cancer waited to see La Niña. They had swollen limbs, diabetes,high blood pressure, and other ailments. Looking bone-tired, twoleathery-skinned cowboys in white hats and boots slouched on a bench. But whenone of La Niña’s many assistants (all of whom wore white trousers and a rosaryslung over a purple shirt) led a song praising El Niño Fidencio and La Niña, thecowboys sat up and sang.Claudia Ortiz, a heavy 34-year-old woman, told me she’d been trying to conceivea child for three years. She’d spent her life’s savings on fertility treatmentsbut had had no success. Six months earlier, she’d started visiting La Niña. Eachtime, the teenager had put her hand over Claudia’s uterus and whispered ablessing. During the third visit, La Niña said she felt the presence of a baby.Today, Claudia had brought along an ultrasound image. She held it up to the sunand pointed to a tiny fetus situated above her hips. Weeping, she told me, “Thisis my son. I have La Niña to thank.”Roberto Rosco had broken both of his legs six months earlier, when he had falleninto a well. Doctors screwed in a plate, but the bone couldn’t take it. Facing alifetime in a wheelchair, Rosco had started visiting La Niña. “Every time Icome, I feel better,” he told me. “My bones are stronger.”Later I met Dr. Maria Suarez, a former family practitioner from Monterrey, whosuffers from epilepsy. She started coming to La Niña six mouths ago, aftergiving up on clinically prescribed remedies. “My faith in her is the only thingthat relieves my suffering,” she said.“But you’re a trained physician,” I replied. “Do you really believe in herpowers?”“Absolutely,” she said.Despite the long line of people waiting to see La Niña, I was invited inside. Itook a seat by the wall to watch. A short, attractive teenager, she stood beforean altar cluttered with images of Jesus Christ, the Virgin of Guadalupe, theBuddha, and El Niño Fidencio. It was cool and dark, save for the sifted lightfrom an opaque window and half a dozen candles. La Niña wore white trousers anda white T-shirt draped with a purple satin cape. Her face was framed by long,black hair pulled back in a ponytail. Her unblinking eyes slanted upward.A mother wheeled her young son into the sacristy. He was bald except for a fewwisps of hair—presumably as a result of cancer treatments—and he sat listlesslyin his chair. La Niña stared at him for a long diagnostic moment. Then shegrabbed a bedsheet and covered him. She took up a bouquet of laurel boughs andwhisked it over the boy with fluid, curlicue motions as she chanted a prayer.Then she whipped off the sheet, gave it to the boy’s mother, and told her thather son’s cure would come if she covered the boy up with the sheet every day forthe next month.I watched several more patients come and go. Finally, the curandera looked at meand whispered to an assistant. “La Niña would like to bless you,” the assistantsaid. I figured, what the hell?I approached the altar and stood facing her. She was just over half my height.She held my hands in hers and looked up at me. Her forehead was smooth, hercheeks glistened with sweat. Her eyes, which were at half-mast, looked rightthrough me, yet with a certain tenderness. She was attractive, but in agenderless way. She inspired the sort of affection one might feel for an infant.La Niña waved her hand up and down my torso, murmured a blessing, and captivatedme. I felt a sort of hypnotic lull, a creeping belief that this kid had powers.Then she opened her eyes and told me I was done. What? Already?An hour later, I was back in the waiting area. Another assistant came out andtold me that La Niña’s family would like to invite me to lunch. I felt strangelyguilty striding past all of the sick and needy people as I headed into theprophet’s inner sanctum. Inside, behind the altar, was the house where La Niñalived with her mom, dad, brothers, and sisters. The kitchen was full of people,dozens of assistants dressed in purple, either preparing or eating lunch.Adriana’s father sat at a table. He wore a cowboy hat and a denim shirt. Helooked exhausted and somewhat neglected. I sat down next to him and was servedbeans, sweetened bread, and tortillas.He told me how hard it was to be a simple farmer and the father of a prophet atthe same time. “To come home from the fields to see hundreds of people lined upto be healed by my nine-year-old daughter was hard to take. Five years ago, Ihad to build a house around Adriana’s healing powers,” he said.Moments later, La Niña herself came in and took a seat next to me. She wasserved a plate of food. Now she wasn’t the miracle-working healer with scores ofpeople waiting for five minutes of her time, but a kid at a lunch table drinkinga Coke. After a long moment, I broke the silence by asking her if she rememberedher first patient. She shook her head no. Then I asked how she healed.“I don’t really know,” she replied. “I cure people with their own faith. I justhelp them find it.” We fell quiet for a moment.“What are you writing about?” she asked me suddenly, looking over my notebookand leaning an elbow on my knee. There was a residual power to her touch.“Happiness,” I said. “Are you happy?”“Yes, very happy,” she replied. She was looking up at me searchingly with thosetimeless, faraway eyes. Then, suddenly, she was up. She walked over to herfather and hugged and kissed him on the cheek. And then she was gone, back tothe sick and the suffering.I left Paredón wondering if Alaya’s powers were nothing more than hocus-pocus,the same sort of empty faith healing you sometimes see at religious revivals. Ordid La Niña possess something special, some culture-specific ability tostimulate an internal healing mechanism? Whatever the answer, an extraordinarynumber of people in this region turn to La Niña—and faith healers like her—intimes of need. She addresses their pain and dispenses hope, the poor man’s mostvaluable commodity. People leave feeling that they’ve been heard, that someonecared, if only for just a few minutes. For her followers—the poor anduninsured—La Niña provides a powerful dose of pain mitigation. And, as novelistCarlos Fuentes once said of his native country, it is impossible to understandMexico without appreciating what it is to believe in miracles.THE WISE MANThe city of Saltillo lies 50 miles southwest of Monterrey in the ChihuahuanDesert. A cool, sunny, high-altitude oasis, Saltillo was recently voted “bestcity to live in” by a leading Mexican business journal because of its colonialarchitecture, celebrated bird and desert museums, and norteño cuisine. Itspopulation of half a million or so enjoys one of the nation’s highest per capitaincomes—about $14,000 per year.I’d come to Saltillo to meet a newspaper columnist and humorist named ArmandoFuentes Aguirre, who also goes by the name “El Catón” (the Wise Man). I’d beenhearing about him since I arrived in Mexico City, where he is well known—evenamong serious academics—as a man who profoundly understands the soul ofnortheastern Mexico. Trained as a lawyer and experienced in teaching, Fuenteshad spent more than four decades penning four columns daily for the 150newspapers that published his work. A man who had traveled the world, had metRonald Reagan, and had received dozens of awards for his writing, he is arguablythe most famous chronicler of Mexico’s daily life. But, more than that, he isfamously happy.I met Fuentes in Saltillo one Saturday morning at a brick-walled restaurantdecorated with Aztec pottery and Toulouse-Lautrec posters. Outside, palm treesrustled in a warm, dry breeze. The town’s mayor had gone to considerable troubleto arrange my meeting with El Catón, who was still a busy man at 68. When wefinally sat down over tortillas, black beans, and eggs, he began the interviewby thanking me for my time. He exuded a take-all-the-time-you-need attitude. Hewore a corduroy sports jacket over a plaid shirt. His gray hair was tossed toone side, and his lantern jaw and steel-rimmed glasses might have been jarringon another man, but actually enhanced his pleasant demeanor.I liked him instantly.“Did you know that all the worldwide databases point to this region as thehappiest in the hemisphere?” I asked. “Do you have any idea why?”“I’m not surprised,” he replied. “They say that St. Peter is always a bitnervous when someone from Saltillo appears at the Pearly Gates.”“Why’s that?”“Because he knows that heaven is a downgrade from Saltillo.”He laughed and then turned professorial. “We’ve been isolated in this part ofthe country since the 16th century, surrounded by desert,” he said. “We’ve hadto be self-sufficient, to rely heavily on our neighbors and especially ourfamilies. We’ve had to work hard to survive, but that is tempered by theindigenous influence. Indians here in the north are the Chichimecas. Once ayear, they have a huge party and drink mitote [a fermented corn beverage]. Theydrink until they fall to the ground. They dance, have sex, drink, and eat. Whenthe Spanish friars came, they tried to convince the Chichimecas to give up thefiesta, and they justifiably refused. Why give up joy in your life with so muchwork to do? So we just incorporated it into our culture. We celebrateeverything. Mother’s Day. Father’s Day. Godfather’s Day. Saint’s Days. Deadpeople’s days. Something every week. We invent reasons together. We know how tomix work and pleasure.”El Catón looked at my empty coffee cup and called the waitress over to fill it.It was a sunny morning; rays of sunshine slanted through the window and spilledonto the table. He rested his folded hands in front of him and looked at methrough his glasses. As he waited for the next question, I noticed that hisfacial expression naturally settled into a smile.“Can you talk more about faith and family?” I asked. “It seems you can’t have aconversation about happiness in Mexico without those two topics coming up.”“Sure. You need to believe in something to be happy,” he replied. “You need tobelieve in something bigger than yourself, something that transcends you. Thisgives you hope, and that is part of happiness. Your body needs company, but yoursoul needs company too. And that’s the company of God. I think it’s harder foran atheist to have company for the soul. We cannot live without faith, hope, andlove. It’s something we get from our elders. It’s in everyone around us. If welive only for ourselves, we’re not going to be happy.“There’s a story I tell to illustrate the Mexican notion of faith: Someone asksa farmer, ‘What are you doing?’“The farmer says, ‘I’m plowing a field.’“‘Why are you plowing a field?’“‘To plant seeds.’“‘Why?’“‘To get wheat.’“‘Why?’“‘To make bread.’“‘Why?’“‘To live.’“‘Why?’“‘So I can plow a field.’“Do you see the vicious cycle?” he asked. “But if you ask a child why she ispicking a flower, she will say, ‘To have something of beauty.’“‘Why?’“‘To make a bouquet.’“‘Why?’“‘To bring it to the Virgin.’“Giovanni Papini actually wrote this,” Fuentes said, referring to the early20th-century Italian writer. “But it sums up the mind-set in this region too. Ifyou think only about yourself, your problems will be endless—you’ll have a newpain in your back, some part of your car will need fixing, your savings accountwon’t be big enough. Fix one problem, and a new one always appears to take itsplace. But when you worry about someone else’s problems, or volunteer your time,you take the light off of your own troubles. This is part of the reason I have aprogram where I feed about 100 kids every day.”I’d heard about Fuentes’s quiet philanthropic work. While this region may be thehappiest part of the Western Hemisphere, there continue to be pockets wherepeople lack the basics. Potrero de Abrego, a village outside Saltillo is—orwas—one such place. People there work for local landowners at poverty wages orscratch meager crops out of infertile soil. For a long time, many people wenthungry. A few years ago, Fuentes noticed this, and it bothered him. He couldn’tsupport the entire town, but he figured he could give the new generation a headstart. So he and his wife started a program. They constructed a simple building,hired a dietitian to design a simple lunch that fulfilled kids’ nutritionalneeds, and convinced mothers in the village to staff the place. Now, every dayat noon, 107 children and 8 elderly people showed up for a daily meal. A dozenor so mothers volunteered to cook, serve, and clean up, and hence, once a day,much of the community came together. Since the program has been in place,children’s math scores, science scores, and even athletic ability have surpassedall of the surrounding towns’—simply because of El Catón’s meal-a-daygenerosity.“We have so much, and they have almost nothing,” he said of the villagers. “It’sa way to say thank you. We don’t want to get anything in return. It’s not a hugeact for a rich man.”A rich man? When I met him, Fuentes’s income was likely no higher than that of amid-level manager at an American corporation.“We’re not rich because we have a lot of money,” he said. “We’re rich because wehave few needs. And we celebrate everything. In our family, if we don’t have anoccasion, we invent one. There are people who will never be happy because theywant too much of life. If they don’t get what they want, they don’t letthemselves be happy. The trick is to work for contentment. Then happiness willfollow.”Fuentes left me with one last pearl of wisdom, his grandfather’s recipe forhappiness:Drink without getting drunkLove without suffering jealousyEat without overindulgingNever argueAnd once in a while, with great discretion, misbehave.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lessons from MexicoMake no mistake, the people in and around Monterrey have serious problems. Inmany villages, kids suffer from malnutrition and lack of education. Talented,intelligent men and women are stuck working in breweries or factories that makejeans. Their dreams and aspirations are going unmet. The less fortunate feelthey must leave their families and travel to the United States for work. Yetdespite all these hurdles—the high levels of corruption and the relatively lowlevels of development and questionable governance—these Mexicans are blessedwith, shall we say, happiness assets.The Sun BonusMexicans collect a small happiness bump from the sun bonus—more annual hours ofsunlight than most of their neighbors to the north, and hence more vitamin D.There’s more to this than sunny clichés may suggest. “Emerging research showsthat tanning prompts manufacture of endorphins that give you a feeling similarto a runner’s high,” said Dr. Gregory Plotnikoff of the Allina Center for HealthCare Innovation in Minneapolis. He also points to the importance of vitamin Dfor overall health, well-being, and longevity. “Safe sunning, no burning” meansmore health-promoting vitamin D—a compound many Americans lack in sufficientquantities.A Personal Sense of Freedom“The freer we feel, the happier we say we are,” said Alejandro Moreno, apolitical scientist from the Mexico Autonomous Institute of Technology.“Statistically speaking, the sense of individual freedom of choice is, by far,the variable that contributes most significantly to happiness.” Over the past 30years, a growing sense of individual freedom has accompanied a growing sense ofhappiness. This isn’t true of all countries (Singapore is one exception), butfor Western societies that have been poor and repressed, policies that maximizefreedom may boost well-being, too.Nurturing LaughterMexican humor focuses not on an underclass or ethnicity, but on crooked cops,politicians on the take, and the difficult lives of everyday citizens. It servesas a stress-shedding device and a balm for the pain: Mexicans laugh atthemselves, laugh at taxes, and quite literally laugh in the face of death.But can the rest of us get happier by creating an environment of laughter?Nicole Fuentes believes so. “Humor and happiness are related in pretty much thesame way that optimism and happiness are related,” she says. “You can choose tobe more optimistic, if you work at it. Humor leads to social bonding due toshared positive emotions and the discharge of negative ones.” People who laughmore tend to be more extroverted, have higher levels of self-esteem, and lowerlevels of depression. Laughter has been associated with an array of healthbenefits—lowered stress levels and the release of beneficial hormones amongthem. “Laugh therapy” has become mainstream enough that the Pentagon has evenpaid some personnel to train in one version of it to help military families whoare separated from loved ones. Mexicans in and around Monterrey are born into anenvironment of good humor. Perhaps it’s a cue to spend more time watching thecomedy channel and hanging out with jokers?Just Enough MoneyNorteños seem to have gotten it right when it comes to money, too. Consider theguitar as a metaphor. If the strings are too loose, the guitar plays flat; ifthe strings are too tight, it sounds sharp. The trick is to find just the righttension so the guitar is in tune. Mexicans, it seems, have an easier timegetting their financial lives in tune. If you’re an average Mexican, you’relikely to be surrounded by people who are not running a status race. You feelless pressure to keep up with the proverbial Joneses except, perhaps, when itcomes to socializing and party throwing. This environment of modest expectationsenables people to feel good about themselves without competing for a big house,a fast car, or the latest fashions.Faith TherapyThen there’s the norteños’ special brand of religion. According to the GeneralSocial Survey, religious people tend to be happier than nonreligious people,even in the United States. But simply believing in God alone doesn’t guaranteehappiness. In countries such as Jordan and Algeria, more than 90 percent ofpeople surveyed said religion was very important in their lives, yet thesenations do not occupy the top rankings of subjective well-being. Somehow, thenorteños’ combination of indigenous influences meshed with Christian beliefs hasyielded a more uplifting faith than that commonly found elsewhere. Thissupercharged faith helps people cope with hardship—even if it just means havingsomeone listen to one’s problems. It could also have something to do with theway that membership in a religious community boosts happiness. In any case,taking a cue from norteños and joining a faith-based community stacks the deckin favor of happiness. Religious communities that provide access to a built-in,social, weekly congregation offer a means for ritualized stress relief andself-assessment. (Research on the brain activity of Tibetan monks, for example,has shown that the more experienced practitioners of meditation have higherlevels of activity in the left prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain wherehappiness “lives.”) People who belong to a faith-based community are less likelyto engage in risky behavior, and then there’s the X-factor. If we pray forhappiness, does it help us get happier? Most people in the world would say yes.OversocializeMexicans understand the importance of social interaction. They spend much oftheir day socializing with family and friends; a good party will almost alwaystrump work. As you’ll recall, psychologists have identified two types ofhappiness: experienced happiness and remembered happiness. We tend to rememberhigh points and low points in our lives. But experienced happiness is the sum ofthe little joys throughout the day. You might not recall a drink with friends, aconversation over the fence, or happy hour with co-workers as highlights of yourlife, but working them in on a daily basis will increase your overall happiness.In this sense, norteños can offer a big lesson for overworked people living inother countries: Make friends and make time for them. Seven to nine hours ofsocial time each day will likely maximize your happiness.Family FirstIn Mexico, “family” is an expansive term that encompasses mom, dad, brothers,sisters, your grandma’s sister’s daughter, your uncle’s neighbor, and your thirdcousin twice removed who is working in the United States. “Family and friendsplay a more central role in our lives than they do in most other countries,”Fuentes said. “Both faith and family help create a social network that providessupport in times of financial hardship or illness, and forms the basis of aninformal economy that allows people to acquire goods and services they might nototherwise afford.” Mexicans are able to tolerate a huge deal of problems anddisorder in the environment, as long as the family is doing fine. Family is aninvaluable source of support. Grandmothers take care of their grandchildren sothat moms can go to work and earn money. The second generation takes care oftheir parents when they are old. In this regard, the lesson is clear: For mostof us, the more time we spend with family and friends, the happier we’ll be.Counting Our BlessingsPerhaps the best advice, though, comes from Armando Fuentes Aguirre, the WiseOne, who reminds us that 90 percent of happiness is the pursuit of simplecontentment—actively appreciating the good around us. The more we can take thefocus off ourselves and forget our own problems, the happier we’ll be.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVESAN LUIS OBISPO:A Real American Dreamimage [Images/188.jpg]Making room for bikes is the only way to go in San Luis Obispo, California, atown that prides itself on making recreation and social interaction easier.Newer establishments often have a bike valet service. PHOTO BY DAN BUETTNERSan Luis Obispo:A Real American DreamTwo and a half centuries ago, Father Junípero Serra, the Franciscan missionary,set out from San Diego on a journey up California’s El Camino Real—the “King’sHighway”—to a place the Spanish called the Bear Plain, where grizzlies wereknown to be abundant. There he told a small crew to build a church to spreadChristianity among the Chumash people. Serra named the new mission after hisfavorite saint, Louis, bishop of Toulouse, which eventually lent its name to thetown that grew up around the mission: San Luis Obispo.This morning, I’m two miles away from that same church, with its austerewhitewashed adobe walls, and I’m getting a history lesson from Kenneth Schwartz,professor emeritus of architecture at the nearby California Polytechnic StateUniversity (Cal Poly). Schwartz designed and built the house we’re sittingin—exactly the way he wanted it to be—and it’s a testament to a life richlylived. There’s African art on the walls. “I’ve visited all seven continents,” hesays as I admire one of the paintings. Shelves display framed photos of hischildren, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren in a living room surrounded byfloor-to-ceiling windows with views of his well-manicured garden.Schwartz is asking me to picture San Luis Obispo the way it looked in 1772, whenit was still a Chumash hunting settlement. “Do you know the first thing theSpanish did when they started building a city in the New World?” he asks,narrowing his clear, blue eyes behind his glasses.I shake my head.He sticks his forefinger in his mouth, pops it out of his cheek, and holds it upin the air. Those blue eyes are laughing now. “They checked which way the windblew,” he says. That told them which way the street dust and animal dung wouldblow; they then skewed the directions of the streets so future buildings wouldblock the winds from sweeping the streets. “Those early Spanish settlements inCalifornia were planned,” he explains. “They followed the Law of the Indies, adictate by King Philip of Spain set down in 1573.” But in much of the UnitedStates, a different tradition took hold, and it strongly opposed this kind ofdidactic vision. “Our civic attitude has been, ‘We’re a democracy, dammit, andnobody is going to tell us what the hell to do with our land,’” Schwartz says.“It took a long time for this country to recognize that without some land-useregulations, there would just be chaos.”In 1952, when Schwartz moved from Los Angeles to teach at Cal Poly, heencountered this attitude among the town fathers of San Luis Obispo. At thetime, the community had all the trappings of a postwar California boomtown,choked with neon signs and power lines, without any of the graceful toweringtrees that you see downtown today. Back then, according to Schwartz, San LuisObispo was “Anyplace, U.S.A.,” a nondescript western community of 14,000controlled by a few powerful property owners and conservative business leaders.He decided to get involved in city government when a newly elected mayor offeredhim a seat on the city’s planning commission. “Citizen planners were not expertsin those days,” he says. “They were the butcher, the baker, the candlestickmaker.” Besides, the planning commission’s only power was as a recommendingbody, not as a decision-making body.But in 1969, after eight years of planning, Schwartz decided to run for mayorand went on to become the longest serving mayor in the town’s contemporaryhistory, holding the office for five consecutive two-year terms until 1979. Infact, by the time Schwartz left office, the winds had changed, and San LuisObispo had moved to the forefront of an American planning renaissance. The“reactionary business community,” as he called it, that once ran the citycouncil was replaced by a more progressive group of city leaders, who in turnset a new standard for signs, utility lines, and planted all thoseaforementioned trees. Under Schwartz, the downtown area became visuallyattractive and more pedestrian friendly. More important, Highway 101—the coastalfreeway built on top of Father Serra’s old Camino Real—no longer passed by thefront of the mission and cut through the center of town. What used to be acentral artery was completely blocked off to traffic, with a central missionplaza constructed in its place—kind of a central park running down to the banksof a cleaned-up San Luis Creek. Today there are walkways on either side of SanLuis Creek, with terraced café patios across from the mission side filled withpeople trying out local wines or going for walks or checking out the art centeror the historical museum on the edge of the plaza or the historic missionitself. The plaza has become the sparkling crown of what is now recognized asone of the happiest cities in the United States.According a 2008 Gallup-Healthways study, in fact, the 44,000 residents of SanLuis Obispo today enjoy stratospheric levels of emotional well-being. Not onlyare they more likely than residents of other U.S. cities to smile and toexperience joy, they are also less likely to experience pain or depression. Infact, in terms of their overall emotional health, they ranked number 1 in thenation. People in San Luis Obispo are thriving with a sense of purpose, meaningthat a majority of them expect things will get even better. And they are notonly happy in their city, but also happy with their city—with much higher ratesof satisfaction with their local government than citizens of othermunicipalities. So this begs the question: How did they do it? What can we learnfrom their experience? Can you actually plan a city to become one of thehappiest in the United States?San Luis Obispo Facts--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Nation: United States of AmericaLocation: Midway between Los Angeles and San Francisco on the Central Coast ofCaliforniaCity Population: 44,075 people--------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE MIDDLE KINGDOMI’d come to San Luis Obispo to find answers to these important questions.Following a late-night, three-hour drive up the coast from Los Angeles, I foundthe small, family-run bed and breakfast called Petit Soleil—“little sun” inFrench—where I’d made a reservation. But by the time I arrived, the office hadclosed. Fortunately, I found an envelope taped to the outside of the door withmy name on it. Inside were my room key and a note—“See you in the morning!”The next day, after coffee and a quick breakfast, I inquired at the front deskabout the nearest bicycle rental. John Conner, the impishly cheerful hotel owner(he owns the place with his wife, Dianne), was behind the desk. He brought mearound front and unlocked one of the two house bikes, a sturdy chrome cruiserpainted candy-apple red. I hopped on and was set to be on my way when Iremembered—I still hadn’t checked in!“Can I give you my credit card?” I asked.“Oh, let’s just do it later,” he said. “It’s easier on my brain that way.”“But what if I just pedal off with your sweet bike and don’t come back?” Iasked.“I trust you,” he said, and beamed.Both culturally and geographically, San Luis Obispo (or SLO as residentssometimes call it) is about halfway between Los Angeles and San Francisco. DanKrieger, a Cal Poly professor who catalogs local color in his weekly historycolumn in the Tribune, dubbed San Luis Obispo County the Middle Kingdom in his1990 history. The San Luis Obispo region can almost claim its own castle—WilliamRandolph Hearst built his walled fortress 45 minutes up the highway in SanSimeon—but it’s called the Middle Kingdom because it isn’t in the orbit ofeither big city to the north or the south.Riding through town on the main bike thoroughfare, the Bill Roalman Trail, youcan look up and see one of the seven sisters—giant, grassy-tufted hills ofvolcanic rock—squatting just outside of town. There’s an only-in-California,Dr.-Seuss-does-Swiss-chalet feel to the landscape here, with sea-foam greenbosoms never quite out of your line of sight. In fact, the omnipresence of thosehills makes you feel that, at any moment, you can just ride right out oftown—and you really never are more than 20 minutes away from herb-blanketedmountain bike or hiking trails. On one hike, I freshened my breath with wildanisette plucked off the side of a trail leading up the tallest and most popularsister, Bishop’s Peak. But don’t get too lulled on the outskirts of thisWhoville nestled into strange-looking mounds: There were signs warning “mountainlion habitat” on the entrance to a path behind the Poly campus. Mountain lions,five minutes from a Jamba Juice!My favorite bike ride turned out to be zipping down the Monterey Street hill,right by the big Volvo dealership with its lot full of luxury convertibles, andright by the mission itself, to the farmer’s market held every Thursday night,year-round. I parked my bike at the free “bike valet” (over 15,000 served). Thekid put my bike behind velvet ropes (okay, maybe just ropes), gave me my ticket,and sent me down the street. It seemed like the entire town was at the farmer’smarket—middle-aged folks as well as the Archie set from campus—walking up anddown Higuera Street hand in hand while using their free hands to squeezecartoon-perfect tomatoes or to sample supermarket-shaming strawberries. Thequality of this bounty of fresh produce was overwhelming to this Midwesterner,who was still getting over a long winter of trucked-in produce. Every possibletype of bell pepper was on display, next to squash, citrus fruits, Japaneseeggplant, pistachio butter, broccoli, and fiddlehead ferns, all of it perfectand produced locally.And it wasn’t just the diversity of the food that was on display: On oneremarkable stretch of curb, the booth to the gay-lesbian alliance sat next tothe libertarian booth, which was next to a population control booth, which wasnext to the California Highway Patrol booth (with two CHiPs standing out frontin full khaki uniforms, complete with Ray-Ban aviators), which was next to theNation of Islam booth and across the street from a dream interpretation tent.Smoke from a barbecued rib joint wafted over a vegan stand, and every time Iwalked by the Asian barbecue area they stopped chopping whatever they werechopping, smiled, and waved. Tolerant people appeared to be happy people.As the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index had shown, the people of San LuisObispo are mentally and physically healthy, ranking number 20 in the nation.They are also relatively wealthy. But a close look at these statistics alsoreveals that the people of San Luis Obispo are (to borrow Thomas Jefferson’senlightened turn of phrase) somehow more driven in the pursuit of happiness thanpeople living elsewhere. Missions abound: There are more than 1,100 nonprofitorganizations in San Luis Obispo County. Of 260,000 residents in themetropolitan area, more than 64,000 volunteer. And in a nation where, for betteror for worse, the individual is more strongly identified with vocation than anyother aspect of life, it’s also significant that the citizens of SLO rank in theupper third for happiness at their jobs.THE JOY OF WINELeslie Mead is one of those happy workers. Every morning, she commutes from herhome in the Edna Valley past cow patches and vineyards, to her job at TalleyVineyards, a small winemaking operation in the Arroyo Grande Valley 6.8 milesaway. “It’s so beautiful,” she said.Before coming to SLO, Mead had lived in Santa Cruz, California, where she’dcared for her mother who was dying of cancer. Born in Virginia and raised inHonolulu, Mead had grown up a Navy brat, and as an adult she’d bounced aroundthe West Coast—up to Oregon, down to Santa Cruz—working as a scuba diver inHawaii then as an urban forester in Calaveras County. “I checked the treesaround power lines,” she said. Somehow, Mead had become a tree cop. She wasn’tvery happy.Looking for a way to put her chemistry training to work (she’d studied chemistryin college and had loved its precision), she landed a gig at one of the largestvineyards in the country. Central California is one of the most picturesqueplaces in the nation—when you can see it. Much of the time, it’s blanketed byfog, and this was reflected in Mead’s depressed mood. She liked her work at thewinery, but she didn’t like much else. The traffic during her commute was“intense,” her neighborhood crowded and unfriendly, and everywhere she lookedwas another stinky, deadbeat, dread-locked trustafarian with an outstretchedpalm. “The hippie culture really bothered me,” she says. “All these rich kidswho thought it was cool to panhandle.”Great Grapes--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Drinking even one glass of wine leads to increases in the happiness-inducingchemical dopamine in our brain. Enjoying that glass of wine with friends willalso add to an enhanced feeling of cheer.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------After her mom passed away, Mead realized she had to do something different, tomake some kind of change. “I understand unhappy people,” she says. “But I don’tunderstand unhappy people who are scared of change.” She didn’t want to beunhappy 20 years down the proverbial road—not when there was an actual roadleading somewhere else. “You only get one shot at this,” she said. So she movedto San Luis Obispo.Taking a $25,000 pay cut, Mead accepted a position as a winemaker at TalleyVineyards, south of SLO. In Santa Cruz, she’d been a production manager at avineyard that produced 400,000 cases of wine. “That was never the type ofwinemaking that I wanted to pursue,” she said. Talley Vineyards produces a tenthas many bottles a year. Today her responsibilities include overseeing everythingthat happens to the grape, from vine to bottle: the cultivating of the soil, thepressing and fermentation, the racking in French oak barrels. She tastes theproduct at several different steps along the way. She works closely with bothfieldworkers and cellar workers to make sure each harvest is maximized forflavor. And then, because she’s so familiar with the product, she becomes theface of the wine itself: Acting as sort of the head chef to Brian Talley’srestaurant owner, she promotes the wine at tastings, market conventions, andrestaurants.A good winemaker, she said, is part farmer, part chemist, part craftsman, andpart party host. It’s an amazing job, so amazing that oftentimes it doesn’t seemlike work to Mead. “I can’t think of another industry where people spend more oftheir personal time getting together to work,” she said. “So many wine peopleare going to meetings to learn about the newest techniques at tasting groups, orhow to improve your customer’s palate—and nobody is getting paid for it.”As the Gallup poll suggests, happy people feel a sense of purpose on the job.The built-in social atmosphere of the wine industry has helped Mead forge a deepconnection with her co-workers at Talley. And, like she says, much of it isvoluntary: She started teaching an English as a second language program atTalley’s farm, where she helps a few of the 250 farm workers with their skills.She’s also a big part of the company’s Mano Tinta (Red Hand) program, whichdirects proceeds from a special batch of red wine blends to the Fund forVineyard and Farm Workers, an organization that helps worker families withhousing, health care, and children’s services. She also gives a lot of her timeto a couple of “geeky wine groups”—the World of Pinot Noir and the Central CoastWine Technical Group, where she swaps wine-production tips with her peers. “Ifeel really lucky that Talley gives me the type of latitude that they do,” Meadsays. “They believe volunteering is a positive thing for the company. If I wereto work for somebody else and say I was going to be gone 10 or 20 hours a weekduring a critical time, I’m not sure they would let me do that.”Although she’s happy at work, the other end of her commute is still important toher happiness. Mead lives with her husband and two dogs in a 120-year-old,two-bedroom house on the edge of a 40-acre vegetable farm (happy people aremarried, but don’t necessarily have children). The couple exercises together bytaking long walks around the beautiful big farm, but they avoid getting dirty.“We can look at how the cabbage is coming in, see the broccoli coming in,” shesaid, “but we don’t have to do the work.” Happy people often have hobbies (whichhelps them stay connected socially), but while Mead’s husband fliesremote-controlled sailplanes (airplanes without motors) competitively, she saysthat she doesn’t have a hobby of her own. And then she remembers that she does:Her hobby is wine, the ultimate social lubricant.CITY WITH A MISSIONIt’s fitting that SLO’s identity was built around an actual mission. Thewhitewashed walls of Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa rise from the hill in thecenter of the city. When it was built in 1772, this consecrated outpost was onlyone-fifth of what would eventually become 22 Catholic missions on the CaminoReal. The Old Mission, as it’s known to SLO-politans, is now the home church tomore than 2,000 families and serves as the engine beneath the hood of a powerfultourism industry (tourism is the third largest employer in SLO County, behindgovernment and agriculture). The Old Mission’s pastor is Russell Brown, a58-year-old former Dominican monk. Brown was raised as a Methodist and wasworking as a counselor for the University of California at Santa Cruz beforedeciding to change his personal mission. “Those ten years at the university wentby so quickly,” Brown said, “that I thought another ten or twenty could go byjust like that.” He joined the Dominicans, the same monastic order as that ofSaint Thomas Aquinas, an order that has long been responsible for carrying theintellectual weight of the church. Aquinas was the Italian theologian who in thelatter part of the 13th century first reconciled Aristotle’s conception ofhappiness through virtue in this world, eudaimonia, with Christianity’s beliefthat happiness is only possible through (and after) death. Aristotle furtherargued that happiness is something that you achieve, not something that you are.Aquinas was the first important Christian thinker to acknowledge that humanhappiness, albeit imperfect, could be actively attained through good works onEarth, a fore-taste of salvation.Brown believes there are a couple different routes to this earthly happiness.“You make a choice in life,” he said. “You either do what you want to do and gowherever that takes you in the world, or you say, ‘I want to live here, and I’lldo whatever it takes to live here.’” Brown chose to change careers in order tofurther his life’s mission in a new and meaningful way, which brought him to theactual mission in San Luis Obispo.For many others living in San Luis Obispo, their mission is just that—to live inSan Luis Obispo. On their first day of classes, Cal Poly students are warned,you’re going to love it here, but after four years, you’re probably going tohave to leave. That’s because of the limited economic opportunities in a town ofthis size and the competition created by people willing to make substantialsacrifices in order to live here, either by deferring home ownership for yearsor by participating in informal markets like “labor pools.” I met one interiordesigner, for example, who traded her design work for dental work. Dan Kriegertold me he had a hot tub put in, and the handyman he hired traded some computerwork for the use of a cement mixer. The desire to live here by any meansnecessary may spur a special brand of creative entrepreneurship: SLO has farmore self-employed people per capita than the average community in the UnitedStates. Bottom line, there is something more than long-term prudence implied inthat foreboding first-day message given to the freshmen at Cal Poly: Theunderlying message seems to be that it’s a special privilege to live in SLO. Thepeople who live here believe that, and as a result, they seem to be reallycommitted to living here.Which brings us back to the fight over the central plaza.A SEA CHANGEBy law, business signs in San Luis Obispo must be small and unobtrusive. In1977, when Kenneth Schwartz was mayor, a new ordinance limited blinking lightsand required that signage adhered to size restrictions. “Signs just beget moresigns,” said Pierre Rademaker, owner of Pierre Rademaker Design. And that’scoming from the guy who designed the original Gap sign. I met Rademaker in hisdowntown office just before noon on a Friday, just as he was about to shut itdown, as he does every Friday at midday. Wearing blue jeans and a Hawaiianshirt, he somehow looked pre-relaxed when he told me, “I give everybody Fridayafternoons off so we can run errands that would normally eat up your Saturday.”Rademaker decided to move to SLO 25 years ago, after getting stuck one too manytimes in bumper-to-bumper traffic on the Santa Ana Freeway in Orange County tothe south. “I was 26, newly married, and living in a nice apartment,” he said,“but we felt the need to go somewhere.” And when he made it to San Luis Obispohe knew immediately: “I thought, ‘I’m never going back!’”A long daily commute tugs at the sweater of society, Rademaker believed. Thelonger the commute, the more rapid the unraveling. “You don’t feel as connectedto a city,” he said. “When you get home from a half-hour commute to work,there’s no way you’re going to feel like going to a city council meeting.”(Rademaker’s intuition is right on: Psychologist Daniel Kahneman of Princetonfound that on a daily basis, commuting ranks as people’s least favoriteactivity, behind housework and child care. “Intimate relations” scored highest,followed closely by socializing after work and dinner.) But in SLO, there reallywasn’t a commute longer than ten minutes (and even if there was, as ShellyStanwyck in the city manager’s office told me, it was likely to be “gesturefree.”)“Virtually everybody I know here is happy,” Rademaker said, “and I think it maybe because it’s so easy to feel connected.” He speculated that one reason wasthat people feel safe: “There’s less fear than in other places—you don’t worryabout your kids going downtown.” But more important, he said, people in SLO feelthat they can actually make a difference. “It’s easy to be involved,” Rademakersaid. “To feel like you have a voice.”Rademaker traced this feeling of empowerment back to Kenneth Schwartz. “It wasthat mission plaza that changed everything,” he said. “Businesspeople opposed ithugely, but it turned out to be a bonanza for them.” They didn’t know theyneeded it, Rademaker said. “They wanted to stick to their agenda of keeping allthe parking spaces and the highway, but the mission is our biggest draw: Itattracts tourism. It created the space we use for concerts in the plaza. EveryFriday during the summer there’s a free concert with hundreds of people.Afterwards, the restaurants fill up.” Rademaker credited Schwartz for giving thepeople something that Walt Disney was reviving in California around the sametime: the central square. “In the fifties and sixties, we were tearing down mainstreets and town squares—exchanging these central public spaces for thisanonymous sprawl. But Disney had awakened in us a sense of what we were tearingdown. It became important to have a center again, a town square.” But the mostimportant thing the mission plaza changed was the way people thought about theirown city. “If you look at our business community, it went from staid toprogressive,” Rademaker said. “But even better: After the referendum to closethat street, people felt empowered to make change themselves.”A STUDENT PROJECTTHAT CHANGED A CITYA wake-up call rarely makes anybody happy—certainly not at first—and it was nodifferent for the people of San Luis Obispo. When I asked Schwartz if he couldremember the moment the wake-up call happened, he leaned forward and said, “Ican tell you precisely.”Schwartz remembered the day that three Cal Poly architecture students made apresentation to the city council in 1968. “As much as possible, we wanted ourstudents to take on place-based, real-world problems,” he said. The genesis ofthe plaza idea was a homework assignment almost 20 years earlier, when in 1949Margaret Maxwell, a junior college art teacher, asked her students to look atthe downtown and propose ideas where art could be used to beautify the city. “Ithink Margaret had in mind murals, fountains, that sort of thing,” Schwartzsaid. A pair of Maxwell’s students turned in a schematic, which showed MontereyStreet in front of the mission closed and replaced by a public park filled withart and landscaping—a space they called Mission Gardens. By 1968, this idea hadgained momentum, and sides were being drawn for and against, with most of thepublic, including Schwartz, in favor of closing the street and creating what wasnow being called Mission Plaza. However, most of the downtown merchants and thecouncil majority favored keeping the street open. In fact, by 1967 the councilhad declined to reappoint Schwartz to the planning committee because of hisposition. “I suppose I had grown more and more central to the controversy,”Schwartz said.Despite the heated nature of the debate, three architecture students decided tomake the Mission Plaza their senior project. Schwartz was encouraging. “I feltthat the idea of a plaza downtown would be an interesting, dynamic problem forthe students to deal with,” he said. “These students came across an organizationcalled America the Beautiful, which provided small grants of money to stimulatestudents to promote their ideas on community beautification. They were awarded$500 on the condition that they get a matching $500 from a local communitygroup,” Schwartz said. “You know, needs for paper, pencils, gasoline, that typeof thing. So they went to the city council, and the council which had beenembedded in this continuous argument said okay, we’ll give you 500 bucks, but onone condition: if you come up with multiple schemes, and one scheme has to showthe street left open.”The students came up with several different ideas for a mission plaza. One ofthe proposals left the street open as requested. And the city council agreed tolet the students make their presentation at a special study session open to thepublic. “So they have their big hearing,” Schwartz remembered. “The councilchambers are packed. This had become such a controversial item that it wasfilled with curious people, and there stood the students wearing coats and ties,trembling in their shoes,” he said. “The mayor opens the meeting—all five of thecouncil people are present—and the students put up their first proposal, theirfavorite. This proposal showed the street to be closed. The mayor is visiblyagitated. His face was getting more and more red, and after three or fourminutes into the students’ presentation he gaveled the meeting to a halt, turnedto the students, and said, ‘You haven’t done what we asked you to do. We wantour money back!’” Schwartz paused to ask one of his professorial leadingquestions: “Can you imagine the effect that would have on the audience?” I shookmy head again. “Well, they were dumb-founded: a mayor talking to a 21-year-oldcollege student who was doing his best to make a professional presentation? Andhaving this mayor stop the meeting and demand his money back?” Schwartzcontinued. “By sheer luck, one of the men in the audience was a former cityattorney. He was a member of the mission’s parish, and he was there because he’dheard so much about this plaza and he wondered how it would affect theceremonies of the church—weddings and funerals. His name was George Andre, andhe came from an old-line San Luis Obispo ranching family. George stood up,turned to the students, and said, ‘They can’t do that, and if they persist, Iwill represent you at no cost.’ Now the mayor really just came apart. He didn’tknow what to make of this. He had been frustrated going in, and he gaveled themeeting to a close and walked out, leaving the other four council people justagape. And the audience was shocked—they came to hear a presentation, and tohave it closed down without the benefit of being able to hear it! The obviousturmoil got them thinking in new ways.”Happy Cities--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Helping it be one of the happiest cities in the United States, Boulder,Colorado, has official policies that require the preservation of open space forparks and recreational activities as well as a renowned network of bikeways thatare usable year-round.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The local newspaper picked up this story of the sensational town meeting, androde it hard for weeks. A referendum committee of five, including George Andreand Schwartz, collected enough signatures to have the issue placed on the ballotfor a vote by citizens. When given one more chance, the council majority refusedto change its mind about closing the street in front of the mission, thereferendum went to a vote of the people, and passed by a vote of nearly two toone. Monterey Street was summarily closed. The downtown business community wasin a state of shock, and in 1969 Schwartz was elected mayor of San Luis Obispo.You didn’t need to suck on a finger to know which way the wind was blowing now.PUSHING LEADERSWhen it came to the creation of the mission plaza, the process was as powerfulas the result. The citizens of San Luis Obispo ended up being more satisfiedwith their city government than any other city in the Gallup Healthways index,and the reason probably had to do with the active role they took in their city.But the legacy of the mission plaza struggle was not only that council meetingsbecame well attended, with a portion of each meeting devoted to public commentlike the one in 1968. It was also that city government became more transparentand approachable, and SLO’s citizens became galvanized for constant progress.Since the mission plaza referendum, they have consistently pushed theirrepresentatives to push for two key indicators of happiness according to theGallup data: public health and access to outdoor recreation and the arts. Infact, people from SLO take pride in being national leaders in these areas.In 1990, San Luis Obispo became the first municipality in the world to pass asmoking ban in workplaces, including bars. A council member introduced the law,but a private citizen introduced the idea. “I was at an American MedicalAssociation delegates meeting,” recalled Steve Hansen, the soft-spoken localdoctor who was instrumental in the original 1990 ordinance as well as two morerecent ordinances banning smoking on sidewalks and in parks, and soon after inoutdoor public spaces generally. “And there was a presentation on the EPA reportcategorizing secondhand smoke as a group A carcinogen—putting it right therewith benzene and asbestos and estimating that it would kill 50,000 Americansthat year,” he said. One of his former patients, a council member named JerryReiss, was already planning on introducing a more restrictive smoking sectionordinance. “But I reminded him that, due to physical laws, smoke circulates likeurine in a pool,” Hansen said. “I urged him that if you’re for public health,let’s do the right thing that makes the most scientific sense. He agreed, and wegot the total ban passed.” Since then, smoking rates have dropped to 13.4percent in SLO, fifth lowest of any town in the country.A few years later, another citizen pushed for a ban on drive-through fast-foodrestaurants, and now the closest In-N-Out Burger joint is found in Santa Maria,20 minutes down the freeway. San Luis Obispo has also been a leader in clean airlegislation. In an attempt to lure smog-weary tourists (and, serendipitously, tomake fast-food less convenient) from the Los Angeles basin, their city motto inthe 1990s was “Come Up for Air.” They continue to take their air seriouslytoday, with tough restrictions on emission levels within all-new constructionprojects. Health-conscious, outdoors-loving SLO-politans have also demanded morebiking and hiking trails, and to ensure that the sea-foam green hills thosetrails pass through just outside of town remain sea-foam green, they put inplace a strict one percent growth limit that discourages megadevelopers fromtargeting SLO. The city has also negotiated with existing real estate holders tomaintain a “greenbelt” around the city. Since 1994, the city has acquired 3,000acres of open space. San Luis Obispo citizens ranked fifth slimmest in a recentpoll, with an obesity rate of 17.6 percent, compared to the national average of26.5 percent.A city the size of San Luis Obispo “has no business having its own orchestra,”said Barry VanderKelen, executive director of the San Luis Obispo CountyCommunity Foundation. “But it does.” Access to the arts is a key contributor towell-being, the experts say, and maybe because it’s right between Los Angelesand San Francisco, unclaimed by either cultural epicenter, SLO has to provideaccess to the arts on its own, without relying on a bigger municipality. In1986, the city, Cal Poly, and the foundation for the Performing Arts Center cametogether to build an elegant, 1,289-seat concert hall on the edge of the CalPoly campus. The venue has hosted a vibrant slate of classical music, opera, andpop. Around the corner from the mission, on the edge of mission plaza, sits theSan Luis Obispo Art Museum, with two large galleries showcasing local andinternational artists, as well as space for rock concerts, art classes, and filmseminars. Behind the art center, there’s a small amphitheater receding into thehill over the creek where the Music in the Plaza summer concert series is held.Happy Tasks--------------------------------------------------------------------------------According to psychologist Daniel Kahneman’s “day reconstruction method” studies(see “Gathering Joy” [9781426206702_ch04.html#c04]), this is how people ranked anumber of average daily activities from the most enjoyable to the least:socializing after work, relaxing, dinner, lunch, watching TV, socializing atwork, talking on the phone at home, cooking, child care, housework, working,commuting from work, commuting to work.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------“A lot of our residents are newcomers,” explains VanderKelen. “And they reallyfall in love with the place, and want to make sure that they stay in love withthe place, so they invest in it.”Even the larger employers in SLO seem enlightened. On my last day in town, Imade my way to Level Studios, an interactive digital agency with about 200employees, with clients such as Apple, Cisco, Disney, HP, and BlackBerry. DougCarr, Level’s business development director, showed me around the building andtold me about some of the perks that come with being a Level employee. Level hasan innovative ride-sharing program and heavily subsidizes employee bus passes inorder to take advantage of a well-run (and not too SLO) public transportationsystem, for example. Carr has a 17-minute commute himself, but it’s not like a17-minute commute in Los Angeles or San Francisco: “I have three decisions—do Iwant to see the oceans, vineyard, or mountains?” he said. The company alsosponsors blood drives and 5K races and Beer Fridays, where the CFO brings inquality microbrews to sample and everybody can hang out and chop it up in thecompany kitchen a little bit (hanging out with your co-workers also ranks highlyon Daniel Kahneman’s enjoyment scale). But the thing that stuck with me aboutthe company was when Carr told me that only five percent of his employees areactually born and raised here. “People choose to live here,” he said.Leo Tolstoy famously begins Anna Karenina by positing, “Happy families are allalike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” By deduction, this seemsto imply that there’s some sort of golden rule, some sort of plan all thosehappy families follow. But as Kenneth Schwartz points out, being happy inAmerica is a funny thing: We value freedom to pursue happiness over any sort ofplanned happiness, even if the latter is a better guarantee of actual happiness.Our founding documents promise us that the pursuit of happiness is aninalienable right, but there’s no plan to actually achieve it. Maybe our happycities are like Russian happy families and they’re all alike, but it seems thatAmericans feel a need to figure out happiness for themselves. It’s that oldtension between continental planning and Anglo-Saxon freedom.As John Stuart Mill, the British philosopher who gave us On Liberty and whovalued autonomy over any coerced felicity, once wrote, “Let any man call to mindwhat he himself felt on emerging from boyhood—from the tutelage and control ofeven loved and affectionate elders—and entering upon the responsibilities ofmanhood. Was it not like the physical effect of taking off a heavy weight, orreleasing him from obstructive, even if not otherwise painful bonds? Did he notfeel twice as much alive, twice as much human being, as before?” Mill understoodthat we can still listen to great teachers and look to great examples, butultimately the most meaningful lessons are learned on our own.The people of San Luis Obispo have already figured that out.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lessons from San Luis ObispoSan Luis Obispo offers a clear example of how an American community canproactively change itself to create an environment where people live longer,happier lives. A student group galvanized citizens to push through a projectthat created a cultural and social focus for this city and, in so doing,improved the quality of its government. With more citizen participation, thetown’s focus shifted away from optimizing the business environment to maximizingquality of life. As a result, San Luis Obispo gained a more aestheticallypleasing downtown, with less traffic, less pollution, more gathering places,protected green spaces, a farmer’s market, thriving arts, and an environmentwhere it’s harder to do things that are bad for you (smoke, eat fast food) andeasier to do things that are good for you (walk, eat vegetables, recreate innature, and bike). The result is arguably the healthiest and happiest city inAmericaA Civic Project Can Galvanize a PopulationThe mission plaza controversy and subsequent referendum ultimately brought theresidents of San Luis Obispo together and taught everybody a lesson aboutcitizen empowerment. One small project that rallies a community to make adifference can send a lasting message that citizens can have a voice ingovernment.Antismoking Policies Can Make People HappierAs the Gallup data shows, it’s hard to be happy without your health. San LuisObispo was the first city to enact antismoking legislation in bars. Othereffective policies include strict citywide bans—no smoking in the workplace, inparks, and in front of office buildings. The idea was to “de-normalize” smoking,so if you’re a smoker, no matter where you go, you’re reminded that it’s thewrong thing to do. This is consistent with findings that, although quit-smokingprograms often fail at first, their success ratio climbs with repeated attempts.So workplace or city policies that support smoke-cessation programs willcontribute to lower smoking rates in the long run.Minimize SignsAs both Pierre Rademaker and Ken Schwartz argued, signs beget more signs. As onesign gets bigger, blinkier, and more distracting, the neighboring business isforced to make its sign even bigger and blinkier. With small, tasteful signs,SLO has not only made the city more aesthetically pleasing, but also ratcheteddown the ubiquitous marketing, thus lessening the temptation to buy—a fleetingsource of happiness. Research also shows that policies that limit fast-foodsigns decrease consumption of junk food, hence bettering people’s diets.Prohibit Drive-through RestaurantsA ban on drive-through restaurants has been on the books in San Luis Obisposince the 1980s. It was originally written to temper car culture in a collegetown, but the silver lining has been its effect on health, especially obesityand the myriad health care costs associated with the obesity epidemic. One ofthe easiest ways to lower obesity rates is to make the healthy choice theeasiest choice. Making it impossible to drive up to a window to easily indulge ahunger pang with a cheese-burger also helps.Build a GreenbeltSan Luis Obispo has an aggressive greenbelt plan in place, as well as anordinance limiting housing growth to one percent a year. With help from the LandConservancy of San Luis Obispo County, a city natural resources managerproactively raises money to buy close-to-town green spaces. This helps toeliminate the kind of suburban sprawl that plagues too many cities. One of thebiggest casualties of sprawl is recreation. A gym just can’t replace convenientaccess to parks, hiking trails, mountain-biking trails, and wildlifepreserves—beautiful areas both to enjoy and to get the body moving. SLO does agreat job making all those areas so easy to see it’s a constant invitation.Support the ArtsKen Schwartz is fond of quoting the Persian proverb, “If you have but two coins,use one for bread to feed the body and the other for hyacinths to feed thesoul.” Schwartz isn’t just talking about growing flowers; he is talking aboutcultivating all kinds of art. Happy people have access to art—painting, film,sculpture, orchestra, opera, and rock and roll—and live in homes and communitiesthat are themselves attractive to the eye. And in order to provide access, youneed to build venues, or upgrade galleries, plant trees, or volunteer time.Around the world, there’s a strong connection between populations that consumeart and their level of well-being.Favor the PedestrianResearch shows that if you make the active option the easy option—goodsidewalks, bike lanes, less and slower traffic—activity levels go up. In SLOactivity levels are high because the mission plaza project closed the oldHighway 101, because there are wide sidewalks, because there are bike lanes andcyclist rights-of-way, because new buildings require bike lockers and showers,because the bus stations are convenient, and because the bus pass system givespeople who work downtown a free pass.Make It Easy to Work for YourselfNearly a quarter of San Luis Obispo workers are self-employed (thus cutting downon commuting times). The more autonomy you have and control you have over yourjob, the more likely you’ll be satisfied with your work. So start your ownbusiness and make your own plans.Build a Town SquareAt the same time that America’s cities were spreading out into the suburbs, WaltDisney designed Disneyland’s entrance to re-create the Main Street and townsquare of days gone by. In the same way, the people of San Luis Obispo refocusedtheir town’s resources inward to a mission plaza to give people a place to meetsocially, to provide a venue for the arts, and to serve as an icon of civicpride.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXLESSONS IN THRIVINGLessons in ThrivingWe’ve heard from the top experts on happiness, met some of the world’s happiestindividuals, and explored places around the world where populations areverifiably thriving. Now what does this all mean to you? What lessons can youtake away from this book to increase your own happiness? What can you learn fromthese stories to help you thrive?As we discovered during our travels, recipes for well-being can varydramatically from one culture to the next. In Denmark, citizens feel well caredfor by their government, knowing their needs will be met for health care,education, and many other social benefits. More than that, Danes trust theirpublic officials, just as they trust their neighbors, with whom they share asense of equality about social status. As part of a wealthy society, Danes areable to slow down and enjoy the finer things, such as music and art, whichcontributes to their overall satisfaction with life.By contrast, Mexicans don’t have much confidence at all in their government,sharing a healthy distrust of the police, in particular, whom they view ascorrupt or incompetent, especially in the face of today’s rampant crime. Yetthey still manage to experience high levels of well-being. To compensate for theshortcomings of their government, they rely on strong relationships with friendsand family, on a supercharged faith in their church, and a remarkable capacityto laugh in the face of hardship. Even though their nation isn’t as wealthy asmany others, Mexicans still find the bright side of daily experience, whichhelps to lift them above all but a few nations in happiness ratings.For people in Singapore, meanwhile, security and rapid economic growth have beenthe key to their good fortune. Determined to live up to their own highexpectations, the citizens of this small island nation during the past 40 yearshave engineered one of the fastest growing economies in the world. The happiestpeople in Asia, they have accepted a broad range of restrictions on theirpersonal freedoms in return for stability and safety. For them, happiness andsuccess have become tightly intertwined.The residents of San Luis Obispo, finally, have handcrafted a Californialifestyle during the past few decades that actively promotes thriving.Deliberately aiming for the right balance between prosperity and the pursuit ofhappiness, the people of this relatively small college town have developed ataste for civic involvement, self-employment, fresh foods, local wines, andvolunteering for good causes, with almost one in four residents donating theirtime to nonprofits. The result has been a boost in civic pride that has raisedtheir level of well-being to one of the highest in the United States.Despite their many differences, these four hot spots of happiness have eachgiven us important clues about ways to improve our own well-being. Each hasshown us what actually works in life’s mix of ups and downs, and in the rest ofthis chapter we’ll take a closer look at these strategies we can apply in ourown lives. But before we do so, we must first come to grips with two powerfulforces that can push each of us away from authentic happiness.This first is our brain’s hardwiring. Research has shown that when it comes torecalling happiness, our memories are unreliable: We tend to remember the highpoints and the low points of any experience, but not the minutiae in between. Wetend to underremember everyday pleasures such as hanging out with friends orengaging in challenging work—what psychologists call intrinsic goods—whileover-remembering fleeting pleasures such as the thrill of an award or buyingsomething bright and shiny—what experts call extrinsic goods. When we look backon our Florida vacation, for example, we’re more likely to remember the rudewaitress at lunch and the amazing pool party than all of the relaxing hours wespent on the beach. That’s why most of us spend too much time and energy goingafter a bigger house, a faster car, the latest fashion, a pay raise, or thenewest electronic gadget—things that don’t bring us lasting happiness.The second force that subtly keeps us from thriving is the distracting nature ofcontemporary life. Each day the average American is bombarded by some 250marketing messages encouraging us to eat things that aren’t good for us and tobuy things we don’t need. Advertisements sell us an idealized vision of youthwhile vastly underplaying the wisdom that comes with age (as well as the greaterdegree of happiness, which peaks after retirement). Online social networks andthe ever-increasing amount of time we spend watching TV have conspired to keepus in front of flickering screens instead of interacting face to face with otherpeople. Elementary schools focus on teaching job skills rather than the arts,civics, and physical education—activities known to produce lifelongsatisfaction. Perhaps the most compelling statistic to come out of recenthappiness research is the fact that, during the past 35 years, while Americanshave worked to increase our income by 20 percent, and the size of our houses hasmore than doubled since 1950, we’ve become no happier as a nation.As worldwide research shows, individuals who thrive tend to possess enough moneyto cover their basic needs, but rather than striving for more cash, they focustheir time and energy on developing a caring group of healthy friends, workingat meaningful jobs, engaging in enriching hobbies, staying in reasonable shape,volunteering, and belonging to faith-based communities. Sounds simple, doesn’tit? But reading about such things isn’t enough: How do you make such nourishingactivities a routine part of your life?The answer lies in changing your environment. As you’ll see in what follows, I’mgoing to suggest a number of ways that you can permanently set up your life tofavor happiness—so that even after you forget about this book, the strategiesthat you put in place will still be working for you. After all, the world’shappiest people don’t take motivational courses to change their ways, nor dothey rely on their genes to promote happiness. But they do live inenvironments—geographic, social, cultural, and physical—that constantly nudgethem into pursuing intrinsic goods and other behaviors that favor long-termwell-being.So how can you set up your life so you’ll spend your time on the right thingsand not chase empty promises of fleeting happiness?To begin with, let’s think about the different domains we live in. What are themain environments that influence what we do? In my research for this book, I’vefound six life domains that we can shape to boost our chances for happiness forthe long term. I call them Thrive Centers, and they’re all interconnected: 1. Community—The nation, state, county, city, or suburb in which you live. Does your government create an environment that helps you to feel good about your life and to live out your values? 2. Workplace—Your job site, or wherever you spend most of your working hours. Have you selected an engaging job that lets you exercise your talents without consuming you? Does your workplace environment facilitate meaningful work? 3. Social life—The circle of friends, acquaintances, and others with whom you come in contact regularly. Do your friends influence you to eat right, to be active, to laugh, and otherwise to reach your potential? Or do they load you down with negative feelings? 4. Financial life—The savings and spending strategies you adopt. Do you have too much easy credit or spending cash? Is it easier for you to save or to spend? 5. Home—Your house, apartment, or condo and the yard or grounds around it. Is your home set up to nudge you into behaviors that favor happiness and away from behaviors that generate discontent? 6. Self—Your education, sense of purpose, and health strategies. When it comes to happiness, does your inner self include a capacity for gratitude, openness to give and receive love, and an appreciation of the arts?As we saw in Denmark, Mexico, Singapore, and San Luis Obispo, the world’shappiest places tend to set up such Thrive Centers so that individuals areconstantly nudged in the right direction. In the pages that follow, you’ll finda set of similar nudges to stack the deck in favor of your own happiness.Setting up these nudges will take some time and effort. But they will be wellworth it as they guide you in subtle but powerful ways to greater well-being.image [Images/227.jpg]The best way to promote Thriving is to set up “nudges” favoring long-termhappiness in all six domains of our lives, Community, Workplace, Social Life,Financial Life, Home, and Self. ILLUSTRATION BY BLUE ZONES LLC1. COMMUNITYTraditionally, economists have measured the health of a nation by its grossnational product. As conventional wisdom goes, the higher a country’s GNP, thebetter off its people will be. And indeed, while people in wealthier communitiesare generally happier than people in poorer ones, the benefits of higher incomefor individuals tend to taper off once income rises above the level necessary toprovide necessities. So if income’s not the magic bullet, what is?Where you live.More than any other factor, including income, education level, and religion, theplace where you live determines your level of happiness. As one study suggested,for example, if you’re an unhappy person in Moldova—still reeling from Sovietrepression decades ago—you’re more likely to get a boost by moving to Denmarkthan you would be by staying put and winning the lottery, marrying the person ofyour dreams, or earning a Ph.D.Results from surveys in 146 countries representing most of the world’spopulation show that the top factors promoting happiness where you live are thefollowing: * Economic freedom—The freedom for citizens to start and run a business, free of excessive regulation, can be even more important than political freedom in determining happiness. * High employment rate—Programs that give people jobs endow them with a sense of purpose and productivity. Unemployed individuals, especially the newly unemployed, suffer markedly lower levels of well-being. Singapore’s “top up” policy has been shown to be effective at achieving higher employment rates. Conversely, places with generous social security systems are no happier than those with little or no social security. * Tolerance—As we saw in Denmark, a nation in which citizens of all walks of life—religious, cultural, and sexual preference—are accepted is more likely to nurture happiness than one that allows discrimination. * Quality of government—Fair legal institutions, a lack of corruption, trustworthy legal systems, and a strong democratic process all promote higher levels of happiness in a nation.As a practical matter, most of us don’t have the luxury or inclination torelocate to a different country. But many of us will move within our country.The average 18-year-old American, for example, will move nine more times in hisor her lifetime, thus offering many opportunities to select a betterenvironment.If we’re in a position to help our current communities thrive, on the otherhand, there are specific things we can do to promote authentic happiness arisingfrom personal growth, family relationships, and community interaction. Thefollowing are a few suggestions from economist Bruno Frey.Provide More Community SpaceAs we saw in San Luis Obispo, a community that develops parks, vibrant citycenters, outdoor restaurants, public gardens, and pedestrian malls makes iteasier for citizens to socialize. Since we know that people are generallyhappier the more they socialize, the key is to make socializing the easy option.Limit Shopping HoursPurchasing new things brings only fleeting, extrinsic satisfaction. By limitingshopping options, we can free up time and resources for intrinsic pursuits. Freysuggests limiting how long stores may stay open. Denmark and the Netherlands,two of the world’s happiest countries, set the maximum shop opening hours at 155and 96 hours a week respectively.Limit the WorkweekWhen it comes to long-term happiness, personal income fails to provide much of aboost for Americans once a household rises above the $60,000-a-year threshold.Individuals who work long hours have less time for social interaction,education, culture, sports, and volunteer work. They’re also more likely tosuffer chronic diseases and a poor family life. The Danish-mandated maximum of37 hours a week is a good benchmark.Support the ArtsA German study has shown a direct correlation between funding in the arts andthe well-being of private citizens. Art gardens, theaters, dance centers,museums, and even street artists not only provide venues for social interaction,but also cultivate authentic happiness.Encourage WalkabilityAny policy that nudges people to live closer to their workplaces increases lifesatisfaction. Healthy people are happier people. Research shows that cities thatbuild sidewalks, add bike lanes, and create a feeling of safety—making theactive option the easy option—tend to increase the activity levels of residents.A few ways to do that: tax fuel, provide tax incentives for living nearworkplaces, and limit investments in augmenting traffic.Grant Maternity LeaveLaws that mandate maternity leave not only help to foster stronger familyrelationships, but also help to assure that newborns get a good start in life.Research has shown that early interaction between parents and children iscritical to a child’s development. Mexican law provides 12 weeks of paidmaternity leave. Danish law gives 18 weeks of paid leave to the mother and 2weeks of paid leave to the father, with an option to take another 32 weeks ofpaid leave between them. In the United States, the Family and Medical Leave Actgrants 12 weeks of leave, but it doesn’t have to be paid leave.Educate Teens About Birth ControlOut-of-wedlock births have long-term negative impacts on the financial andgeneral well-being of parents. What’s more, disadvantaged children are lesslikely to get a good education and more likely to commit a crime. Programs thatteach birth control, distribute contraceptives, and provide reasonable access toabortions have been shown to reduce teenage out-of-wed-lock births. Drilling down to the neighborhood level, the location of your home can stronglyinfluence your daily activities and, hence, your well-being. Here are somecharacteristics of a good neighborhood: * Sidewalks—Look for sidewalks and bike lanes that connect homes. You’re more likely to keep physically fit. (Activity levels in walkable communities are as much as 35 percent higher than in communities where it’s hard to get around.) It’s also easier to be social—you don’t have to cut across the lawn or walk into traffic to interact with your neighbor. * Quiet surroundings—Move to a quiet neighborhood. Humans are supremely adaptable creatures. We can get used to an ugly street or subfreezing weather (Minnesotans are happier than Floridians). But humans don’t adapt to noise. In other words, jet planes overhead, buzzing transmission lines, honking traffic, or loud music from next door promise a daily erosion of happiness. * Walking distance—Again, if it’s easy to access intrinsic goods, you’ll consume more of them. Go to the website www.walkscore.com, type in your address, and see how walkable your neighborhood is in terms of the distances to churches, parks, grocery stores, and museums. * Safety—As we saw in Singapore, a sense of safety was critical for people’s well-being. You might also look for a neighborhood where you’ll feel comfortable letting your kids play outside. Also, research shows that the biggest deterrent to physical activity for some people is perceived danger. In other words, you want the outside environment to draw you out, not nudge you in. * Status equality—Live in a neighborhood with your own economic class of people. As Denmark taught us, you don’t want to be reminded of what you don’t have. One study showed that people would rather make $50,000 a year and live among people who make $50,000 a year than make $100,000 a year and live among people who make $250,000 a year. If every time you drive down the street you see neighbors with nicer cars and bigger houses, you’re more likely to want them, too.2. WORKPLACEMany of us spend more than half our waking hours at work, so finding the rightjob is one of the most important things we can do to influence our happiness.Data from the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, along with the analysis ofsome 1.3 million health claims, show that people who thrive have 20 percentlower health care costs. Moreover, the happiest people at work are also thehappiest people at home. Here are a few ideas for getting the right job and themost satisfaction from that job.The Right JobIn tough economic times like these, any job may feel like a good one. But aswe’ve seen in Denmark, Mexico, and San Luis Obispo, other factors besides apaycheck determine how much satisfaction we get from our jobs in the long term.According to Claremont University psychologist Mihály Csíkszentmihályi, findinga job that challenges us to an optimal level—one that’s neither so hard that wegive up nor so easy that we get bored, that engages our natural talents, andthat gives us constant feedback—is a sure way to build happiness. You’re morelikely to enjoy a job over the years if it addresses your passions, values, andtalents rather than simply giving you a big paycheck, office, or title. Also,make sure you’re working with the right people. The biggest predictor of whetheror not you’re satisfied with your job is whether you’re working with colleagueswith whom you can be friendly. Before you consider your next job, begin byanswering the following questions: * How is this work important? * What can I contribute? * What excites me? * How can this work challenge me in an ongoing way? * Would I do this work even if I didn’t get paid? * How does this address my passions? * Would I think about my work even when I’m not working? * Does this work make me feel proud? * Can I achieve excellence at this? * Can I forge a true friendship with the other people who work here?The Right Way to WorkHere are some ground rules to make sure your job contributes to your overallhappiness: * Avoid long commutes. Commuting is the least favorite activity people do on a daily basis. In fact, people who commute an hour each way would need an additional 40 percent of their monthly wage to be as satisfied with their life as people who walk to the office. Try to find a job in your neighborhood or within an easy, fast commute, and you will set yourself up for minimal angst. * Limit your workweek to 40 hours. Choose a job that’s not going to infringe on family and social time or exclude other interests and hobbies. On the whole, part-time workers report more life satisfaction than full-time workers. * Don’t skip vacations. Vacations lower stress levels, rejuvenate us, and give us time to pursue a wider variety of interests. A Danish study shows that we get the most satisfaction from an average of six weeks of vacation per year. The average American worker takes between 8 and 16 days of vacation per year! Research also shows that much of the happiness bump from vacation comes from the planning and anticipation. So if you have four weeks of vacation, you might increase your overall satisfaction by planning four weeklong trips instead of one big one. * Enjoy happy hour. Socializing after work is one of the most satisfying activities we do on a daily basis. Try to find a workplace where post-work socializing with co-workers is the norm. Questions to ask during an interview: Do you like the other employees? Are there any employer-sponsored after-work activities? Do people knock off at five o’clock, or do they work incessantly? * Seek out the right boss. A Gallup-Healthways poll showed that having the right boss is the single biggest determinant of workplace satisfaction. The qualities you should seek in a boss include the following: * Approachability—Can you talk to your boss about your challenges and problems? * Provides regular feedback—Does she tell you when you’re doing a good job and offer constructive suggestions when you’re not? Does she meet with you regularly? * Establishes clear requirements—Are your duties and responsibilities clear? Do you know when you’ve successfully completed a task? * Delegates control—Does your boss get out of the way to let you do your job in a way that works for you? * Practices good listening—Does he really listen to your ideas? Is there open communication? * Offers recognition—Are good work, productivity, and innovation recognized? * Earns your trust—Do you trust your boss? * Considers your best interest—Does your boss care about you as a person?Employ YourselfSelf-employed workers and business owners report some of the highest levels ofwell-being. It may be because they have control over their own work and are morelikely to pursue work that they love, or simply because they are their own bestbosses.Get into TeachingTeachers score higher on most aspects of well-being than people in nonteachingjobs such as sales, manufacturing, farming, and so on—even higher thanself-employed business owners. They view their lives more positively, expressmore optimism, and report a healthier life. This may be because they derivegreat satisfaction from a school’s social environment and from helping preparethe next generation for life. Or it might be simply because the teachingprofession attracts happier people.3. SOCIAL LIFEOne of the most dependable, universal means to a thriving life is simply tosocialize more. Data from Gallup-Health-ways polls on well-being show that thehappiest Americans socialize six or seven hours a day—especially with family andfriends. An analysis by Nicholas Christakis, a social scientist at Harvard, andJames Fowler, a political scientist at the University of California at SanDiego, showed that in a network of more than 12,000 people living in a smallMassachusetts town, the happiest people were also the most connected. As theirsocial circle got happier, so did they. (Conversely, in another study, collegestudents randomly assigned to a mildly depressed roommate became increasinglydepressed over a three-month period.) Even introverts tend to be happier whenthey are around people than when they’re alone, studies have shown. So for thevast majority of us, setting up our lives to make it easier to socialize willaugment the joy in our lives.The quantity of social interaction is only half the prescription. Qualitymatters, too. Who we hang out with has an enormous and measurable influence notonly on how happy we are, but also on how fat we are, or even how lonely we are.On any given Tuesday night, we can sit in a bar and listen to an oldacquaintance’s problems, or we can spend that evening going to the theater withan upbeat friend. According to one statistical analysis, each additional happyfriend we have in our social circle boosts our cheeriness by nine percent, whileeach additional unhappy friend drags it down by seven percent. As we saw inDenmark, having trustworthy friends is critical. And as we saw in Mexico,surrounding ourselves with friends that have a sense of humor can also soothestress and hardship. (Laughter has been shown to produce an insulin-like growthfactor chemical—one that acts as an antidepressant and anxiety reducer in rats.)Recent research has also shown that we’re likely to get more satisfaction fromfriends with whom we can have a deep conversation. Such conversations, expertsspeculate, may help more to make sense of our chaotic world and connectmeaningfully with people than ones in which we gossip about celebrity scandals.Since friends are long-term adventures, surrounding ourselves with the rightpeople, and engineering our lives so we spend more time with those people,should have a profound, long-term impact on our happiness.In fact, just being around happy people is going to impact our well-being.Behaviors, it seems, spread partly through subconscious social signals that wepick up from those around us. For example, we tend to automatically mimic whatwe see in the faces of people surrounding us—which is why looking at aphotograph of smiling people can itself often lift your mood. So, just hangingout in a café with upbeat people can improve your mood.Here are some strategies to create the right kind of social bonds.Upgrade Your Social NetworkConsider making a list of the ten people with whom you spend the most time.Then, knowing that certain moods and behaviors are contagious, rate each friendon how lonely, depressed, trustworthy, or funny he or she is, and how likely youare to have a deep conversation with each. Now rank that list in order of themost positive to the most negative. That will give you a good idea about whomyou should spend your time with. If you can’t think of a friend with positiveattributes, then it’s time to widen your social circle. I wouldn’t tell you todump your old friends, but I can tell you that if you cultivate yourrelationships with the people at the top of the list, you’re more likely tobecome a thriver.Join a ClubIdentify your interests or talents and find an organization that will nurturethem. Make a commitment to a club or organization that compels you to show upregularly—through either the organization’s rules or peer pressure. According toone study, joining a group that meets even once a month produces the samehappiness gain as doubling your income.Create Your Own MoaiCreate a group of mutually committed friends—what the Okinawans call a moai.Okinawans, among the world’s longest-lived people, travel through life togetherin clusters of a few friends. They commit to meeting regularly, share spoils inthe case of a windfall, and support each other in times of crisis or grief. Aspart of an experiment in well-being, the town of Albert Lea, a community of18,000 in southern Minnesota, created some 70 moais. Each group shared interests(some were new mothers, or liked to volunteer, or liked sports). Then they madea point to walk together several times weekly for ten weeks, so that bonds couldform in their groups. A year later, more than half the Albert Lea moais arestill together.Reconnect with Your FaithJust about every study done on the connection between religion and well-beingshows that the two go hand in hand. While we’re not sure if churchgoing makesyou happy or if happy people tend to be religious, research shows that peoplewho belong to a faith-based community—regardless of the particular faith—andattend at least four times per month may live as much as 14 years longer thanpeople who don’t. Churchgoers are less likely to engage in risky behaviors(which can lead to profound unhappiness), are satisfied with less money, haveless stress, and—to the point of this section—have built-in social networks.You’ll amplify benefits if you join the church choir, volunteer as a greeter, orcommit to read for the congregation. If you don’t belong to a church or havedrifted away from the church of your birth, seek out a new church that matchesyour current values and worldview. Start by asking friends or people you admireto make some suggestions, and try a new church in each of the next eight weeks.Marry the Right PersonFor most of us, choosing the right mate is one of the biggest reasons for ourhappiness. People in a long-term, committed relationship suffer less stress. Asurvey conducted in 2004 showed that 42 percent of married couples describedthemselves as “very happy,” compared with 17 percent of divorced people and 23percent of people who never married. Researchers Hyoun K. Kim of the OregonSocial Learning Center in Eugene and Patrick C. McKenry of Ohio State Universityfound that national survey data showed that marriage helps protect psychologicalwell-being. In other words, making the effort to find the right mate and tocommit for life favors happiness. This is not to say that marriage assuresbliss. Marry the wrong person, and happiness levels plummet, along withlong-term health. (Bad marriages have been shown to increase stress, which inturn increases the risk of cancer and heart disease.) How to find the rightperson? * Kiss lots of frogs. Ruut Veenhoven hypothesizes that people in urban areas enjoy a greater opportunity to date a wide variety of people before they choose their mate. The point here is to date a lot of people who you think align with your values and interests. * Look more than skin deep. We’re genetically wired to be attracted to certain characteristics that favor short-term sexual attractiveness rather than long-term bliss. While his big muscles and her pretty face may sing virtues on the surface, a sense of humor and compassion are more likely to keep you in the relationship for the long run. * Marry someone similar to you. A recent study in the European Economic Review showed that people who have similar tastes and earning abilities, and who share things equally, have a better chance at marriage survival. This may suggest that if you like folk dancing, try to find a mate who also likes folk dancing—or marathon running or late-night TV. Look for partners who make as much money as you do, or at least are inclined to share what they have. If you’re already married, working with your partner to find common interests should stack the deck in your favor. Also, partners who regularly attend church together are more likely to stay together. So, if you’re a churchgoer, seek another churchgoer. A family that plays and prays together stays together. * Avoid cohabitation. While leasing before buying may work for car purchases, the same is not true in shopping for a mate. A study that looked at a large number of successful and unsuccessful marriages found that living with a prospective spouse seems to make for a shorter, lower-quality marriage. * Try marriage training. Learning early in the relationship how to deal with conflict and listen effectively (“If I understand you correctly, you just said…”) will stack the deck in favor of a successful marriage. A study of American marriage training programs found that only 4 percent of couples receiving the instruction had split up after five years, compared with 25 percent of partners that did not have the training. * Nice reminder. Saying something positive to your spouse keeps a marriage vital.Be realistic about the joys of parenthoodNext to our spouse, our children are the people with whom we spend the mosttime. Contrary to conventional wisdom, having children does not automaticallybring us greater happiness. In fact, it can often be the reverse. Research showsthat during the first year of a child’s life both the mother and the fatherexperience an increase in life satisfaction, but that soon changes, and areduction in general happiness occurs for both parents—presumably from the addedfinancial, relationship, and responsibility stress—and mothers tend to be lesshappy than fathers. In fact, women find caring for children less pleasurablethan jogging and only slightly more pleasurable than doing the dishes. The goodnews for parents is that happiness seems to rebound when children turn 18. Therewards of parenting, it seems, are not easily measured on a happiness scale.4. FINANCIAL LIFESumming up all the available research on the connection between money andhappiness, Ed Diener says that the key to greater well-being is to have moneybut not to want it too much. So the best long-term strategy for financialaffairs puts in place the disciplines and mechanism that help you savemindlessly and spend thoughtfully. Here are some ideas.Pay Off Your HouseThe average American household has nearly $70,000 in mortgage debt. Althoughfinancial planners may argue that your mortgage payments are tax deductible, andtherefore your house can be a ready source of credit to underwrite purchases andbetter-returning investments, making a monthly mortgage payment can also be aregular source of anxiety and stress. When it comes to experienced happiness,it’s more important to manage daily stress than to build up net worth. Peoplewho pay off their mortgages go to bed at night knowing that in the event of acatastrophe they will always have a roof overhead. Moreover, in today’s economy,there’s no assurance that even a savings account will outperform the fivepercent or so that we currently pay on our mortgages.Enroll in Automatic Savings or Investment PlansMake sure you’re subscribed to your employer’s retirement plan if one isoffered. If you’re not, consider a plan that automatically deducts from yourpaycheck (credit unions and most banks have such plans). If you can save justsixteen dollars a week beginning at age 18 and invest it in an S&P 500 Indexfund, you will retire a millionaire at age 65 (given historical rates ofreturn).Avoid Credit CardsThe average American household has a debt balance of more than $8,000 on awhopping eight credit and debit cards! You should have one credit card, and itshould not be in your wallet. Put it somewhere that requires a conscious effortto retrieve it (for example, your locked glove compartment or a hidden pocket inyour purse). When you pay cash for a purchase, actually counting out thosebills, you feel the purchase. You’re less likely to spend frivolously on a newshirt you don’t need or a just-released gadget. Moreover, if you pay cash you’llbe less likely to go into debt—a sure source of ongoing stress.Create a Giving AccountIn their book Nudge, economist Richard Thaler and former law professor Cass R.Sunstein propose the creation of a “giving account.” The idea is to deposit asum of money—say $1,000—at the beginning of the year. We mentally commit thatmoney to our favorite charity, to be donated at year’s end. But if, in theintervening 52 weeks, we get a parking ticket or traffic violation, or haveother sorts of annoying “life is unfair!” mishaps, we can pay for them out ofthis giving account. Since we know that mitigating day-to-day stresses willincrease experienced happiness, and since research shows that we get moresatisfaction from spending on others than spending on ourselves, this annualdiscipline will stack the deck in favor of greater long-term happiness.Invest in ExperiencesSpending your money on family vacations, dance classes, ongoing education, musiclessons, scuba diving, and so forth is more likely to provide you with a lastingsense of well-being than buying the latest fashions or splurging on a new car.5. HOMEWhat if you could set up your home in a way that would enhance your well-beingjust by your living in it? Once again, the trick is knowing the oftencounterintuitive habits that research shows lead to happiness and thenorganizing your home to propel you gently toward those behaviors. Here are someexamples.Fewer TV ScreensHave only one TV in your house. Ideally it would be located in an out-of-the-wayroom in a cabinet. Take the TVs out of your kids’ rooms. Research shows thatthis will likely reduce your child’s body fat index by nudging them into beingmore active. Remove the TV from the kitchen, too. This reduces mindless eatingand excessive calorie consumption.Cancel CableAn Israeli study suggests that when TV viewers are confronted by the paradox oftoo many choices on cable TV, they are more satisfied sticking with basic TV. AsTV watching increases, so do worries about children and a sense of guilt.Own a PetMany studies suggest that pet owners are healthier and happier than peoplewithout pets. Pet owners have been shown to have lower blood pressure and fewerstress hormones in their blood. In fact, the presence of a pet was found to bemore effective than a spouse or a friend in easing the effects of stress on theheart. Pets foster self-esteem, calmness, soothing, and a feeling of acceptance.They provide daily, nonjudgmental companionship and a means for us to take thefocus off our own needs and problems. Pet-owning seniors suffer fewer minorhealth problems, need to see the doctor less often, and enjoy lower health carecosts. If a dog needs to get walked every day, guess who else tends to getwalked?Create a Meditation SpaceRegular meditation has been shown to activate areas of the brain that registerpleasure and to inhibit parts of the brain that register pain. There are severalforms of meditation, some as simple as mindfully counting your breaths or slowlyscanning your body head to toe and acknowledging each body part. Establishing adimly lit, quiet space where you can sit comfortably will make daily meditationmore accessible.Designate a “Flow” RoomAs we learned earlier, Mihály Csíkszentmihály describes the experience he calls“flow” as a state of engagement in which you’re using your talents, optimallychallenged, consummately interested, and able to let time melt away. I recommendyou create a room that will promote such flow. Taking a cue from family rooms inDenmark, you could establish a room where it’s easy to play an instrument, totake part in a hobby, to read a book, or to play a game with family. Place alarge table in the middle of the room to accommodate the whole family’sprojects. Line the room with books. Lose the clock, TV, computer, or any othergadget that takes your mind off engaging activities. Make it the mostaesthetically appealing room in the house (with the best light and the nicestfurniture) so you’ll naturally be drawn to spend time in it.Create a Pride ShrineSet up one area of your house to routinely remind you of the people,accomplishments, and events of which you are proud. In my home, I’ve created ashrine of sorts, inspired by Okinawan ancestor shrines. I first identified theprivate part of my house that gets the most traffic (the hallway between ourbedrooms and bathroom). Then I built a display table and designated wall space.There I display pictures of my kids, my beloved grandmother, my college diploma,my daughter’s report card, a ribbon I won for greased-pig wrestling in ninthgrade. You get the idea. Every time I walk by, I’m rewarded with a surge ofpride and a reminder that I’m part of a family continuum.Grow a GardenSeveral studies show that gardening lowers stress hormones. Hoeing, planting,weeding, fertilizing, and harvesting all occasion regular, low-intensity,range-of-motion exercise. It’s one of those nudges that encourages almost dailyactivity for at least four months of the year. And you end up with healthfulvegetables!Let the Sunshine InMaximize sunlight by creating outdoor areas (patio, lawn chairs) for basking andbig, south-facing windows for indoor sunlight. Emerging research shows thatsunlight prompts manufacture of endorphins that give you a feeling similar to arunner’s high. It also promotes the manufacture of vitamin D—a compound mostAmericans lack in sufficient quantities. Just a few minutes of quality sunlighton the face and arms (only between May and September in northern latitudes)provides more vitamin D than a gallon of milk. And while it’s difficult to getenough quality sunlight through the window for vitamin D production,window-filtered sunlight hitting the retina will still help raise spirits andmitigate against seasonal affective disorder.Paint Your MoodA great deal of research has been done on color and mood. Painting your livingroom yellow will inspire energy and a bright mood. Paint areas for meditationand rest a soothing color to promote relaxation. Japanese hospitals are painteda healing shade of sea-foam green.Optimize Your Bedroom for SleepThe average person should sleep six to seven hours per night for optimal healthand well-being. Your bedroom should be primarily for sleeping. Free it from TVs,computers, brightly glowing clocks, and other distractions. Make sure it can getdark and cool. If reading helps you sleep, keep books and magazines nearby.Also, make sure the light is within arm’s reach so that if you begin to nod off,you can switch off the light without getting up and spoiling your slumber.Finally, minimize use of the alarm clock. You’ll feel best if you let your bodywake you up.6. SELFThe goal here is to train yourself in a few areas that will yield well-beingbenefits for the long run. Take time to recognize your values, strengths,talents, passions, and gifts. Your personal sense of purpose may be something assimple as seeing that your children or grandchildren grow up well. It could alsocome from a job or a hobby, especially if they are challenging and satisfying.If you set out to learn a musical instrument or new language, you get a doublebonus, as both have been shown to help keep your brain sharper longer.“Exercising your brain is important,” explains neuropsychologist Paul Nussbaumof the University of Pittsburgh. “You should especially find things to do thatare novel and complex. Once you get good at them, and they are no longer novel,then you can move on to something else. So you’re kind of doing strengthtraining for the brain, which has been shown to decrease your rate of memoryloss and maybe even decrease the rate at which one might develop Alzheimer’sDisease.”Here are some ways to create a thriver’s mind-set.Personal Mission StatementStart by articulating your personal mission statement. First, answer thisquestion in a single, memorable sentence: What is your reason for getting up inthe morning? Richard Leider, the best-selling author of The Power of Purpose,recommends that you take a personal inventory by using this formula: G + P + V =C. His research suggests that in order to know your core sense of purpose, youfirst need to have a clear understanding of your core values—your Gifts (whatyou have to offer the world), Passion, and Values equals your Calling. “Are youusing your GIFTS on something you feel PASSIONATE about in an environment thatVALUES you? If so,” Leider says, “you’re on purpose. You have a reason to get upin the morning!”Find a Purpose PartnerFind someone to whom you can communicate your life purpose as well as a plan forrealizing it. “Think of one person who has the capacity to give you thatperiodic wake-up nudge to the potential of your life,” Leider recommends. “Makea practice to talk with the ‘Purpose Partner’ about your life purpose two orthree times a year.”Develop Arts AppreciationLearning to appreciate the painting of favorite artists can set you up for aboost in happiness every time you see their works. Taking time to listen to yourfavorite composers can do the same. Even learning the history and rules of asport (stats, superlatives, backgrounds of the players) can give you a richerand long-lived appreciation than that of the casual sports fan.Find a HobbyWe should all have a hobby that enhances our work life. As we saw in Denmark, 95percent of Danes belong to a club, many of which are organized around commoninterests such as model trains, jumping rabbits, or playing chess. Some Daneseven knock off work at mid-afternoon to spend the rest of the day engaged in ahobby. This offers life another dimension that wholly caters to our interestsand talents. It helps us get into the state of flow and increases both evaluatedand experienced happiness.Develop Your People SkillsLearning people skills such as how to build consensus, how to listenconstructively, and how to feel compassion for others sets you up with tools tobuild and maintain a social circle. Dale Carnegie’s How to Win Friends andInfluence People, for all of its salesman overtones, offers several pieces ofgenuinely good advice—like remembering people’s birthdays with a card, callingpeople by their first names, and asking people about themselves.VolunteerOne of the surest ways to increase your well-being is to volunteer. It can boostyour happiness. Volunteers tend to weigh less, to feel healthier, to have lesschance of suffering a heart attack, and to score higher in every happinessdomain. Volunteering takes the focus off of your own problems and increases yoursense of pride in your community or social network. If you’re not a volunteernow, start small. Volunteer once a month at your church or local social service.As you feel the benefits, research shows, your involvement will likely grow ofits own accord.THRIVING CHILDRENArmed with such insights from the emerging science of happiness, we can nowthink about ways of raising our children to favor long-term happiness. Americanschools currently emphasize math, science, and language arts. No one disputesthe importance of these skills, but how about skills that we know more directlyyield well-being? How can we help our children identify and begin to pursuetheir own sources of flow? How much TV and computer time should we allow them?And later, how can we help them think about a job that’s right for them? Whatqualities should they look for in a mate?So far, such research has been scant. But here are a few of the evidence-basedclues that have emerged to help us raise happier kids.Put Friends FirstA recent study published by the Gallup organization showed that studentwell-being has little or no relationship to income. Over half of what explainswell-being in children is how engaged they are socially. So, as this studysuggests, helping our children find and maintain good friendships is one of themost powerful things we can do for them. Moving into a safe neighborhood withlots of kids the same age will better enable kids to make friends on their own.Establishing friendships with parents of the children who we’d like to see playwith our children is also a good long-term strategy.After-school or Summer JobWhen your children become teenagers, encourage them to find a job that intereststhem. Babysitting, lawn mowing, bagging groceries, or working at a local caféare all jobs open to teens. Such experiences teach teens an appreciation formoney, help to build self-confidence, instill independence, and expand a youngperson’s social circle. A Boston study that followed inner-city kids for morethan 20 years found that the only common denominator among the happiest peoplewas having had a high school job. Education level, profession, income, andmarital status were not as strong as happiness predictors.Music LessonsNudging kids into the musical arts at an early age can not only give them a bumpin academic performance, but also set them up for a lifetime of enjoyment.Civics and Arts AppreciationSince we know that engagement in the arts and participation in government favorwell-being as an adult, giving our children tools that facilitate these twodisciplines prepares them for fulfilling adulthoods.Instill Hope for a Richer FutureShane Lopez, a Gallup senior scientist, has found a clear connection betweenhopefulness and financial literacy. Kids who see a bright, meaningful futurestart to earn, keep, and save money better than those who don’t. Such kids comeup with more ideas about how to make money, become more pragmatic when usingmoney, and are more creative in saving money. How can parents help? * by getting their kids talking about what they want to do when they grow up * by asking their children for ideas about how to realize their desired future and work through obstacles * by showing genuine excitement about their children’s dreamsMoms seem to do this better than dads, Lopez says.Encourage SportsBecause of school busing on the one hand and funding cuts for gym classes on theother, we’ve engineered much of the physical activity out of our children’slives. That makes it increasingly important for parents to make sure childrenget involved with organized sports. A recent study showed that when teenagegirls participate in sports, it helps them succeed later in life. Femaleathletes have higher rates of employment and higher education, and playingsports also reduces their risk of becoming obese.NUDGING YOU TOWARD HAPPINESSI started this book by introducing you to Panchita, the wood-chopping,machete-wielding, 103-year-old Costa Rican woman with the whooping laugh. Iremember the first day I met her. It was a bright morning, and I walked to theedge of the town of Hojancha and onto a footpath that led to her jungle shack. Icould smell roasting tortillas and hear the tinny, syrupy sabanero music from atransistor radio wafting out of nearby houses. On the footpath, a resident troopof howler monkeys languished in the mango trees overhead. When Panchita saw me,she pushed open a wooden shutter and, with her hands raised, exclaimed, “Oh, howGod blesses me. A visitor from America!” And then she hurried out into thecourtyard to hug me. “Come sit down,” she said, and took a seat on thewood-plank bench outside her house. She was wearing a festive, frillydress—green this time instead of pink. Long, green earrings dangled from herears, and she had her gray-tinted hair pulled back with a rhinestone-studdedcomb. We spent several hours together. She told me about her life—the yearsworking in a travelers’ lodge, the murder of her son, and the time when, at age76, she beat up a local drunk for watching her bathe. “I gave it to him good,”she said with a pointed finger. Throughout the conversation, she called me Papiand, to make a point, endearingly put her hand lightly on my arm.Later that morning, a woman stopped by to help her sweep her floors. “I don’tcome here because I have to,” the woman told me. “Panchita has a way of makingmy day happier.”At noon, Panchita announced it was time to make lunch. I followed her into hersimple, two-room house: a bedroom with a table and chairs, a bed with tatteredsheets and blankets and pictures of Jesus on the wall, and a kitchen. Thekitchen was simple and pleasant, with two windows that opened onto the yard.Panchita cooked on a wood-burning stove next to a wood counter, a soapstone sinkwith cold running water, a small pantry, and a modest refrigerator. Shehand-ground corn, heated up beans, and fried the only two eggs she had. Then shepresented them to me. “Eat!” she commanded. Before I dug in, I realized that itwas the only food in her kitchen, and I persuaded her to eat it.I’d sought out Panchita because I’d been looking for clues to explain how she’dmanaged to arrive at her 11th decade with so much vitality. But now I realizethat I’d overlooked something important. In addition to maintaining herexcellent diet and active lifestyle, Panchita was also thriving—experiencingauthentic, lifelong happiness—which, as I’ve learned since, can add about tenextra years to a person’s life expectancy. And although some of her positiveoutlook might be due to favorable genes, I also realized that her surroundingsdeserved most of the credit. Growing up on the Nicoya Peninsula, she’d been borninto a culture of faith where God gave her life a clear meaning. She’d earnedenough money to cover her basic expenses, but certainly not enough to tempt herinto any frivolous spending. Her home had been loaded with nudges that kept hermoving all day—from the hand grinder for the corn to the stove fed with wood—andher neighbors had offered her daily social interaction. Her porch had providedher with many sunny afternoons. Panchita’s environment, in short, had shaped herfor happiness.There’s a lesson here for you: You can shape your own environments to livebetter longer, too. The best way to do that, as we’ve seen, is to follow thepractices of the world’s most experienced thrivers: Set reasonable goals foryour life. Seek out a place to live where people are already thriving. Choose acommunity where you can live out your interests. Find a modest house in aneighborhood of other modest houses, with neighbors you can call friends andsidewalks that let you walk where you need to go. Recognize your purpose inliving each day. Take time to appreciate the arts. Find a job that you lovewithout worrying too much about the salary. Find a hobby that fuels yourpassions. Take six weeks of vacation no matter what. Set your life up so thatyou’re physically active every day. Spend six hours a day with your lover, kids,and a handful of TRUE friends. Meditate, pray, or nap daily.And call your mother."},{"pageContent":"SPECIAL BONUS CHAPTERThe Truth About Living LongerExcerpted from The Blue Zones: Lessons for Living Longer From the People Who’veLived the Longestby Dan BuettnerAvailable wherever books are soldThe Truth About Living LongerExcerpted from The Blue Zones: Lessons for Living Longer From the People Who’veLived the Longest When Juan Ponce de León landed on the northeast coast of Florida on April 2,1513, he was searching, it’s been said, for a Fountain of Youth—a fabled springof water that could bestow everlasting life. Historians now know there was moreto the story. The reason the Spanish explorer set out to investigate lands northof the Bahamas was probably because Spain had reinstated Christopher Columbus’sson Diego as military governor, effectively removing Ponce de León from theoffice. Nevertheless, the legend behind Ponce de León’s voyage stuck.The idea of discovering a magic source of long life still has so much appealtoday, five centuries later, that charlatans and fools perpetuate the sameboneheaded quest, whether it comes disguised as a pill, diet, or medicalprocedure. In an all-out effort to squash the charlatans forever, demographer S.Jay Olshansky of the University of Illinois at Chicago and more than 50 of theworld’s top longevity experts issued a position statement in 2002 that was asblunt as they could fashion it.“Our language on this matter must be unambiguous,” they wrote. “There are nolifestyle changes, surgical procedures, vitamins, antioxidants, hormones, ortechniques of genetic engineering available today that have been demonstrated toinfluence the processes of aging.”The brutal reality about aging is that it has only an accelerator pedal. We haveyet to discover whether a brake exists for people. The name of the game is tokeep from pushing the accelerator pedal so hard that we speed up the agingprocess. The average American, however, by living a fast and furious lifestyle,pushes that accelerator too hard and too much.This book is about discovering the world’s best practices in health andlongevity and putting them to work in our lives. Most of us have more controlover how long we live than we think. In fact, experts say that if we adopted theright lifestyle, we could add at least ten good years and suffer a fraction ofthe diseases that kill us prematurely. This could mean an extra quality decadeof life!To identify the secrets of longevity, our team of demographers, medicalscientists, and journalists went straight to the best sources. We traveled tothe Blue Zones—four of the healthiest corners of the globe—where a remarkablyhigh rate of the longest-living people manage to avoid many of the diseases thatkill Americans. These are the places where people enjoy up to a 3 times betterchance of reaching 100 than we do.In each of the Blue Zones, we used a survey developed in collaboration with theNational Institute on Aging to identify the lifestyle components that helpexplain the area’s longevity—what the inhabitants choose to eat, how muchphysical activity they get, how they socialize, what traditional medicines theyuse, and so forth. We looked for the common denominators—the practices found inall four populations—and came up with what I consider to be a cross-culturaldistillation of the best practices of health, a de facto formula for longevity.Herein lies the premise of The Blue Zones: If you can optimize your lifestyle,you may gain back an extra decade of good life you’d otherwise miss. What’s thebest way to optimize your lifestyle? Emulate the practices we found in each oneof the Blue Zones.Longevity Pioneer--------------------------------------------------------------------------------In 1550, Italian Luigi Cornaro wrote one of the first longevity “best sellers.”His book, The Art of Living Long, said that life could be extend throughpracticing moderation. His book would be translated into French, English, Dutch,and German. Cornaro may have been on to something; sources differ on his exactage, he lived well into his 90s and possibly beyond.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------FACTS ABOUT AGINGWhen taken together, the Blue Zones yielded nine powerful lessons to achieve alonger, better life. But before we get into the details, I think it’s crucial tounderstand a few things about just how people age and establish some basicprinciples and definitions. How long can each of us expect to live? What reallyhappens to our bodies when we age? Why can’t we just take a pill to extend ourlives? How can we live longer? How can we live better? And why does changing ourlifestyles add more good years?To answer these and other fundamental questions, I’ve asked some of the world’sexperts to describe their latest research in everyday terms. Together thesescientists represent the best thinking in biology, geriatrics, and the scienceof longevity. Steven N. Austad, Ph.D., studies the cellular and molecular mechanisms of agingat the University of Texas Health Center at San Antonio. A professor at the Samand Ann Barshop Center for Longevity and Aging, he is the author of Why We Age:What Science Is Discovering About the Body’s Journey Through Life. Robert N. Butler, M.D., is President and CEO of the International LongevityCenter-U.S.A., a policy and education research center in New York City. Aprofessor of geriatrics and adult development at Mount Sinai Medical Center, heis the author of Why Survive: Being Old in America. Jack M. Guralnik, M.D., Ph.D., is chief of the Laboratory of Epidemiology,Demography, and Biometry at the National Institute on Aging in Bethesda,Maryland. Robert Kane, M.D., is director of the Center on Aging and the MinnesotaGeriatric Education Center at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. He isa professor in the School of Public Health, where he holds an endowed chair inLong-term Care and Aging. Thomas T. Perls, M.D., M.P.H., is director of the New England Centenarian Study,an associate professor of medicine and geriatrics at the Boston UniversitySchool of Medicine, and author of Living to 100: Lessons in Living to YourMaximum Potential at Any Age. I interviewed each of these experts separately, then sorted the best of theiranswers to each question. Here’s what they told me.WHAT EXACTLY IS AGING?Robert Kane: That is a very profound question. Number one, aging starts atbirth. If you think about it, there is a constant development that occurs withinall species. You can think of it as the balance between the individual and theenvironment. In essence, we can think of aging as a loss of coping mechanism, afailure to be able to maintain internal control and balance.image [Images/268.jpg]The skin is often where we first notice the outward signs of the aging process.We start out as children, and we gradually accrue various changes in ourcharacteristics. Children are susceptible to the environment and must beprotected. In the case of humans, we probably peak in our mid-20s. We hold ourown for a while, then at some point, perhaps in our mid-40s, we start todecline. Some people would say we actually begin to decline at age 30. Itdepends on the system that you track.Old age is another period when the balance favors the environment; older peopleneed help in protecting themselves. The frailty we associate with old age isbasically the loss of autonomy, the inability to withstand external pressuresand perturbations.Aging includes both the positive and negative changes that occur. Agerontologist would define aging as the risk of dying. Irrespective of thepresence of disease, there is, given this finiteness of a life span, acontinuous risk of dying. In most cases this increases as our age increases.Other factors can change your risk of dying as well as aging, so it’s not thataging alone is the determiner, but it is the overarching change. People havebeen searching for biological markers of aging, and so far nobody has found anythat are absolutely constant and separate from the onset of diseases.People look at, for example, the loss of accommodation in the lens of the eye.Most people become farsighted, usually in their early 40s. It doesn’t happen toeveryone, so you can’t say it’s a universal sign of aging. Graying of hair, lossof collagen in the skin, all of these are changes that have been described withregard to aging. There’s a change in body composition as people get older. Itcan obviously be influenced by exercise and diet, but in general, we lose musclemass and gain body fat. The immune system changes with age and becomes lesscompetent, but again, not in any universal way that we can say is acharacteristic of aging. Steven Austad: I would define aging as the gradual loss of physicalcapabilities, whether you’re talking about the ability to run, to think, allthose things. It’s a gradual and progressive loss of physical and mentalabilities, the ability to do things that you previously could do. What it meansis that basically, you’re not designed to maintain your physical integrityforever. Robert Kane: There are several theories about aging. One is that there are genesin your system that turn on and turn off, either to ameliorate or to expediteaging. Another theory is the “Garbage-Dump Syndrome,” which theorizes that youaccumulate toxins as you go along and things happen.But again, the question you have to ask is why does the body accumulate toxins?Well, you probably accumulate toxins because some of the intracellularmechanisms that were working at one point have stopped working. So are thetoxins really a sign of aging or merely a concomitant of some other biologicalprocess that has changed, presumably driven by some genetic clock that existsinside the body? We honestly just don’t know.Pearly Whites--------------------------------------------------------------------------------A vital part of your digestive system, a bright smile can last a lifetime.Healthy teeth allow us to eat the wide variety of foods found in a balanceddiet, but cavities, ill-fitting dentures, and other oral problems can makechewing painful and may sometimes even lead to eating disorders. Be sure to makeregular dental visits and brushing and flossing a priority to keep your smilehealthy.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------WHAT IS THE AVERAGE AMERICAN LIFESPAN?Robert Kane: I would imagine that a 30-year-old person today has a reasonablechance of living—depending on whether a man or a woman—to his or her late 70s orearly 80s. If you took away major risk factors such as heart disease, cancer,and stroke, you would be adding, I would guess, maybe 5 to 10 years to thatinitial life expectancy. Tom Perls: For most of us, our bodies are like cars built to go 100,000 miles. Afew cars can go 150,000 or more miles with the right genetic makeup. But they dodeteriorate over time, even with the best upkeep. With that deterioration comesfrailty. When you hit a bump in the road, you are less capable of bouncing back.There comes a point, with continued decline, where there’s no bounce back, andthat’s when you pass away.WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF LIVING TO 100?Jack Guralnik: Well, they are small of course, probably less than one percent.Again, figuring it out depends on what age you currently are. If you’re talkingabout someone at birth, it’s a different estimation than for someone who’salready made it to 80. Also, if you want to consider health status, that plays alarge role. Most people who make it to be centenarians when you look back, theywere quite healthy at 80. Tom Perls: I used to equate living to 100 to pickingall five numbers in the lottery: The odds are pretty small. If you havelongevity running in your family paired with good health behaviors, your chancesare greater.Centenarians today are the fastest growing segment of our population, partlybecause we’re doing a better job of screening for high blood pressure. That’sone important lottery ball that we don’t need to leave to chance. Now instead offive numbers, it’s down to four.Another one that we’ve pretty much gotten rid of is substantial childhoodmortality. With much better public health measures like cleaner water supplies,more years of education, improved social-economic status, these things are allreducing the number of lottery balls.The best way to think about reaching 100 is: “The older you get, the healthieryou’ve been.”Steven Austad: The question is—and here’s where I think the best healthpractices are really important—if you live to be 100 years old, what sort of100-year-old are you going to be? Are you going to be bedridden and unable totake care of yourself? Or are you going to be reasonably independent and alert?To me, that’s what the best health practices can really have an impact on.IS THERE A PILL THAT CAN EXTEND LIFE?Robert Kane: There are a lot of nostrums out there. None of them hascredibility. None of them has been even close to rigorously tested, everythingfrom human growth hormone to antioxidants. Every time anyone has studied themwith any degree of rigor, they do not pan out. That does not mean that some newdiscovery may not be just over the horizon, but at the moment that is probablynot the path.image [Images/273.jpg]Ponce de León’s legendary search for the Fountain of Youth is one of the manytales that illustrate the desire to overcome aging.Just think about it: If antioxidants were so healthful, the whole generationthat grew up eating Twinkies, Wonder Bread, and the like (the kinds of foodsthat are loaded with antioxidants to assure that they had a long shelf life andwould never spoil) should never grow old. Robert Butler: DHEA, human growth hormone, and melatonin are all extremelyquestionable, and are probably ill-advised. Using human growth hormone in humanbeings bulks them up. But it does not just mean more muscle mass. With it cancome hypertrophy of the heart, fluid retention, and other problems. And ofcourse there’s a disease, acromegaly, which is actually characterized by anexcess of human growth hormone. DHEA is what’s for years been called the “junkhormone.” In large quantities in our bodies, it converts to both testosteroneand estrogen. Most of the studies on almost all of these hormones have been veryshort-lived, that is six months to a year. So the long-term effects are not wellknown.The best source of information on hormones is Marc Blackman at the Washington,D.C., Veterans Affairs Medical Center, or Mitchell Harman at the KronosLongevity Research Institute in Phoenix, Arizona. They’ve done the mostsophisticated studies and probably the best ones we presently have on thehormone story.ARE VITAMIN SUPPLEMENTS HELPFUL?Robert Butler: Of course you should maintain your basic daily vitaminrequirements. But you shouldn’t get carried away either. Vitamin E was understudy by the National Institute on Aging in the hopes that it would prove to bevery valuable with Alzheimer’s disease. But it was not.So I think, like so many things in nature, it’s a matter of amount, what mightbe called proportionality, or just plain wisdom. People used to think if amultivitamin was good for them, then more of it would be even better, but that’sjust not true, unfortunately.Most vitamin requirements are best achieved by eating six to nine servings offruits and vegetables a day. Very few people do that, so probably the cheapest,least expensive multivitamin you can buy is not a bad idea to help achieve them.If you’re an older man, you should not have a supplement with iron because ironaccumulates in the heart and can lead to a condition called hemosiderosis. Lookon the market for vitamin supplements that do not have iron that are designedspecifically for men.Leading Killers--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Heart Disease: For both U.S. men and women, the leading cause of deathCancer: The second largest killer of American men and womenPrevention: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advocates practicinga healthy lifestyle and regular medical check-ups and screenings--------------------------------------------------------------------------------WHAT’S A SMART DIET FOR LONGEVITY?Robert Kane: Eating a reasonable diet makes a lot of sense. Again, it doesn’tmean that I think you have to be a vegetarian. One of the goals to a healthylifestyle is moderation in all things. What one is looking for is moderation,taking in a level of calories that is necessary and balancing those caloriesacross carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. Taking in really what you need. Thereare some things we know that are just generally bad. Most fast foods are notnecessarily healthy. We seem to like a lot of the things that are bad for us:salt, sugar, fat. There is something about humans that is inherentlyself-destructive, at least when it comes to eating.The best diet is basically one of moderation. You hear about all these peoplethat live on legumes and plant foods and that’s probably okay, but I don’t thinkit’s necessary. One certainly can metabolize a certain amount of meat, but againit’s a question of are you eating European portions or American portions? Areyou eating meat a couple of times a week, or are you eating it every day for twomeals a day? Are you eating processed meats that are filled with fat? Or are youeating good cuts of fairly lean meat?To me, I just come back to moderation. Assuming that you were in pretty goodshape in your 20s, if you could maintain that weight, you would be in goodshape. The truth is at 20, you could for all sorts of reasons, eat all sorts ofterrible things and maintain that weight, because you were more physicallyactive, because your system was just more resilient. As you get older, you losethat resilience. So you are more susceptible to lifestyle behaviors that can doyou harm than you were when you were younger.WHAT CAN ADD ON MORE GOOD YEARS?Robert Kane: Rather than exercising for the sake of exercising, try to makechanges to your lifestyle. Ride a bicycle instead of driving. Walk to the storeinstead of driving. Use the stairs instead of the elevator. Build that into yourlifestyle. The chances are that you will sustain that behavior for a much longertime.And the name of the game here is sustaining. These things that we try—usuallyafter some cataclysmic event has occurred, and we now want to ward off whatseems to be the more perceptible threat of dying—don’t hold up over the longhaul. We find all sorts of reasons not to do it.The second thing I’d tell you is don’t take up smoking. The biggest threat toimproving our lifestyles has been cigarette smoking. That trumps everythingelse. Once you’re a non-smoker, I would try to get you to learn to develop amoderate lifestyle in regard to your weight to build into your daily routineenough exercise to keep you going.DOES GOING TO THE GYM HELP?Robert Kane: Exercise has several quite distinct functions. You havecardiovascular exercise, which we describe as aerobic exercise, which increasesyour body’s capacity to process oxygen. That’s where you go out and work reallyhard and raise your heart rate. Swimming would be a good way to get that kind ofexercise.There’s also antigravity exercise. For example, if you’re trying to preventosteoporosis, swimming isn’t the optimal activity, because it doesn’t increasethe strength of your bones. There, working against gravity, walking, standingdoes more to increase bone metabolism than swimming does.Then there are exercises designed to improve your balance. Tai Chi is one peopletalk about, or yoga. Those are exercises that have been associated with reducingthe risk of falls.Then there are strength exercises, which run all the way from weight lifters,who probably put themselves into a disadvantageous state from overdevelopingtheir muscles, to people who do some modest amount of weight lifting orantigravity exercise that strengthens their muscles.The data suggest that a moderate level of sustained exercise is quite helpful.There are studies that show that people who run marathons tend to have muchbetter cardiovascular systems than people who don’t. You could say that thatsays more is better, but those exercises generally take a toll on your joints.So marathoners have good cardiovascular systems, but they will probably have tohave their joints replaced. But in general, if somebody could do a minimum of 30minutes—maybe we could raise it to 60—of exercise at least five times a weekthat would help. And it doesn’t appear to have to be all at one time, althoughthat seems to be better. If you did that and you could sustain it, that would begood.image [Images/279.jpg]Frank Shearer first put on water skis in 1939. At age 99, he still enjoys theactivity. “I like the outdoors and the exercise,” he says.HOW CAN WE MAXIMIZE THE GOOD YEARS?Robert Kane: Again, there are two issues here. How long can I live? The otheris: How well can I live? And those are different questions. Living an extra twoyears on life support may not necessarily be your goal. The question is: Can youdelay the onset of disability? “Good years” is a very important concept.There are some things I’d certainly recommend for what people would callsuccessful aging. One of them is, in fact, to have a sense of socialconnectedness. Most people enjoy the company of other people, particularly otherpeople who they feel care about them. That seems to give you a sense of wellbeing, whether that raises your endorphin level or lowers your cortisol level.We don’t know why. People have looked for biological markers, and they haven’tbeen successful at finding them. But something happens that makes life moreworthwhile. The days take on more meaning.The other thing that helps a lot of people is doing something they feel iseither interesting or worthwhile. Again, different people have different thingsthey like to do. For instance, people talk about workaholics as being at higherrisk for stress-related illness. But there is no evidence that workaholics arenecessarily a higher risk if they really are enjoying what they’re doing. Ifthey are driven by some externality and feel like they have to earn more money,it creates stress in their lives, which is probably not very healthy. So it’svery individual when it comes to what people want to do.For example, you can’t just say family support is good, because some familysupport is good for some people, and some isn’t for others. There are people whoderive great satisfaction from being with their families. And then there arethose who become very anxious and upset when they are with their families. It isa complex model, which is also very interactive.But if we’re talking about things that give you a sense of fulfillment, a goodlife, the sense of being valued, the sense of being cared for, and the sensethat you are liked—these are all very positive. Tom Perls: A good start to adding more good years to your life would be to getrid of the anti-aging quackery.Some people provide this very pernicious, ugly view of old people that’scompletely false in order to get you worried about getting older. They say theycan stop—and even reverse—aging, claims which are absolutely false. You’ve got abunch of people who are professing to be physicians or scientists, who aresaying that they can stop or reverse the aging process. I will tell you thatreal scientists cannot do such a thing, so what makes the public think thatthese people can?Smoking & Skin--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The most preventable causes of death and disease in the U.S.A. are caused bysmoking tobacco. In addition to the damage done to internal organs, smoking alsoprematurely ages the skin and makes people look older. Recent studies have shownthat a smoker’s skin bears more wrinkles and other signs of premature aging. Thecauses are still under investigation.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------It is mostly hucksterism and charlatanism. They will cost you a lot of money,and these things do not work and, in some instances, can be bad for you. So stayaway from it. These guys are just trying to sell you stuff. What does work isliving the lifestyle of those who we know are living longer, like those people,I suppose, living in the Blue Zones.INTO THE BLUE ZONESWhich brings us back to the Blue Zones project. Over the course of seven years,my team circled the globe, making several trips to each of the four Blue Zonesand meeting the remarkable people who lived there. In each place we confirmedthat people were as old as they said they were, interviewed dozens ofcentenarians, worked with local medical experts, and methodically studied eachof the local lifestyles, habits, and practices.Each Blue Zone revealed its own recipe for longevity, but, as we were todiscover, many of the fundamental ingredients were the same. These commoningredients, our nine lessons of living longer, are deeply embedded in thecultures we studied. I suppose you could say that our quest was for a truefountain of youth, though this fountain does not spring from the ground butcomes to us through centuries of trial and error.For us, it all began on a small island off the coast of Italy."},{"pageContent":"ACKNOWLEDGMENTSMy first thanks goes to Peter Miller, my editor at National Geographic.
