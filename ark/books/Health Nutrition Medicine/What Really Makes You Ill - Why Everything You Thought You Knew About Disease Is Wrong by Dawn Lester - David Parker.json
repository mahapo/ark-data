Itmay be assumed from this that illness is largely unavoidable or is even aninevitable aspect of human life; but this would be a mistaken assumption, asthis book will demonstrate.Nevertheless, the fact that large numbers of people experience some form ofillness during their lives raises some fundamental questions, not least of whichis: why does it occur? In other words, what really makes people ill?The usual responses to such questions refer to two interrelated ideas, both ofwhich are widely believed to be fundamental truths. The first of these ideas isthat illness occurs because a person has contracted a disease of somedescription. The second is that each disease is a distinct entity that can beidentified by the unique symptoms it produces within the body. This book willalso demonstrate that these ideas are not truths.The conventional approach to illness adopted by virtually all systems of‘healthcare’ is one that employs remedies, or ‘medicines’, that are claimed toalleviate or bring an end to a patient’s symptoms. This approach is based on theidea that the cessation of symptoms indicates that the disease has been defeatedand that this successful outcome has been accomplished solely by the ‘medicine’.However, despite their common approach, different healthcare systems employ theuse of different types of ‘medicine’ in the treatment of human disease; these‘medicines’ may take the form of natural substances or products derived fromnatural substances, or they may be in the form of products manufactured fromsynthetic chemical compounds.The use of ‘medicine’ to treat human disease is encapsulated by the quoteattributed to Voltaire, the nom de plume of François-Marie Arouet (1694-1778),that opens this Introduction. However, most people will no doubt consider the18th century idea that doctors have little or no knowledge about medicines,diseases and the human body to have no relevance to the 21st century. It ishighly likely that this viewpoint will be based on the notion that ‘medicalscience’ has made significant advances in the past three centuries and that 21stcentury doctors therefore possess a thorough, if not quite complete, knowledgeof medicines, diseases and the human body. This book will demonstrate otherwise.The advances made in the field of ‘medical science’ have been incorporated intothe healthcare system known as ‘modern medicine’, which is claimed to be theonly system of evidence-based medicine that has a solid foundation in science.The idea that ‘modern medicine’ is the best and most advanced scientific form ofhealthcare has been used as the justification for its promotion as the onlysystem to be implemented by the governments of all countries around the world.It is because ‘modern medicine’ is claimed to be the only system capable ofdelivering genuine healthcare that it forms the main focus of this book.However, as the ensuing discussions will demonstrate, this claim is unfounded.They will also demonstrate that virtually all of the information about diseasepromulgated by the medical establishment is erroneous and that the reason forthis is because it is based on ideas and theories that are fundamentally flawed.The flawed nature of these ideas and theories means that the words of Voltaireremain applicable to the 21st century medical system known as ‘modern medicine’;a system that continues to operate from the basis of a poor level of knowledgeabout medicines, diseases and the human body.The term ‘medical establishment’ is used in this book to refer to all of thepeople, organisations, industries, and academic and research institutions thatpractise, research, teach, promote and otherwise support the system of modernmedicine.It is a truism that a problem can only be solved if it has been thoroughlyunderstood and its root causes have been correctly identified, because problemsonly cease to exist when their causes have been removed; a truism thatinevitably applies to the problem of illness. Yet illness not only continues toexist, it also continues to worsen for large numbers of people, despite thetreatments and preventives employed by ‘modern medicine’.The logical, and correct, conclusion to be drawn from this is that ‘modernmedicine’ has failed to thoroughly understand the nature of the problem and hassimilarly failed to correctly identify all of the root causes. The consequenceof these failures is that the measures employed by the medical establishment areentirely inappropriate as solutions to the problem of disease. Although claimedto treat and prevent disease, these measures, which are usually comprised ofpharmaceutical products, do not remove their causes, they therefore cannot solvethe problem; but more worryingly, these products invariably exacerbate theproblem.The failings of modern medicine with respect to ‘disease’ are solely due to theflawed nature of the theories on which its practices have been based.This statement will, no doubt, be regarded by the vast majority of people ashighly controversial; but that does not deny its veracity. It is requested that,whilst reading this book, readers bear in mind the following saying that isattributed to the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer (1788-1860),> “All truth passes through three stages. First it is ridiculed. Second, it is> violently opposed. Third, it is accepted as being self-evident.”In addition to revealing the flawed nature of the ideas and theories of modernmedicine, the discussions within this book will explain the real nature andcauses of disease and provide readers with information to enable them to makeinformed decisions and take appropriate actions for the benefit of their ownhealth.◆◆◆ Doctors are taught at medical school to prescribe medicines for the treatment ofa disease that has been identified according to a patient’s symptoms. Thediscussions in chapter one reveal why medicines do not restore a patient tohealth and explain the reason that pharmaceutical drugs are harmful rather thanbeneficial.Vaccinations are widely believed to be the safest and most effective method ofpreventing the diseases that are claimed to be caused by ‘infectious agents’.The discussions in chapter two explain the reason that vaccinations areineffective and dangerous and also reveal that they have no basis in science.The idea that certain diseases are infectious and caused by ‘pathogenicmicroorganisms’ owes its origin to the ‘germ theory’. The discussions in chapterthree demonstrate that this theory has never been definitively proven; they alsoreveal that virtually all of the information promulgated about themicroorganisms referred to as ‘germs’ is entirely erroneous.The refutation of the ‘germ theory’ in chapter three raises questions about thereal nature and causes of the diseases referred to as ‘infectious’. Thediscussions in chapter four examine many of the major diseases claimed to be‘communicable’ to reveal the inherent problems within the explanations presentedby the medical establishment; they also provide a number of more credibleexplanations for their occurrence.A number of diseases are claimed to be transmitted between animals and humans.The discussions in chapter five examine a number of animal diseases todemonstrate the flawed nature of this claim and provide more credibleexplanations. This chapter also explains the basic problems with vivisection,which is the use of live animals in experiments conducted for disease researchpurposes.Environmental pollution due to ‘harmful substances and influences’ is a fargreater and more serious threat to human health than is acknowledged by thescientific community, including the medical establishment. The discussions inchapter six explore the major sources of ‘poisons’, both chemical and electricalin nature, that pollute the environment and refer to some of the mainapplications of these poisons. This chapter also discusses the use of toxicchemicals as ingredients of a wide variety of everyday products, such ashousehold products, cosmetics and personal-care products, foods and drinks, aswell as some lesser-known applications.The medical establishment admits to not knowing the ‘exact’ causes of most, ifnot all, chronic health problems, more commonly referred to as noncommunicablediseases. The discussions in chapter seven examine a number of majornoncommunicable diseases to expose the existence and extent of these ‘knowledgegaps’; they also examine some of the known causal factors and reveal theexistence of an underlying mechanism common to virtually all of them.Health problems cannot be considered in isolation; they are invariablyassociated with other circumstances, most of which affect a significantproportion of people throughout the world, especially in countries referred toas ‘developing’. International organisations, especially those within the UNsystem, claim to be able to resolve all of the problems that confront humanityin the 21st century; but this claim is unfounded. The discussions in chaptereight examine the most recent efforts to implement measures claimed to providesolutions to these problems, with particular emphasis on those that impact humanhealth, whether directly or indirectly, and reveal that these measures areinappropriate as solutions, because they fail to address and thereby remove thereal causes of these problems.The reason that ‘modern medicine’ employs inappropriate solutions to the problemof ‘disease’, despite the unimaginably huge sums of money that have been, andcontinue to be, expended on the development of medicines and vaccines, islargely due to the influence of ‘vested interests’. The existence and influenceof these vested interests over key areas of human life, including the healthcaresystem operated by the medical establishment, are discussed in chapter nine.Having revealed the problems with the explanations presented by the medicalestablishment in the previous chapters, the final chapter explains the realnature of ‘disease’. It also discusses how illness is almost always the resultof multiple causes and reveals the existence of a common mechanism. In additionto discussing the problems, chapter ten provides information about how peoplecan reduce their exposures to these causal factors and take responsibility for,and control over, their own health.◆◆◆ The definition of each ‘disease’, referred to as the ‘establishment definition’,is taken from the 2007 edition of the Oxford Concise Medical Dictionary, unlessotherwise stated.All emphases in quoted statements are as they appear in the original.All articles and web pages from which extracts have been quoted are listed inthe References section at the end of the book, unless the web page has beendeleted or the website is no longer active.The dynamic nature of the internet means that web pages and fact sheets areoften updated; the information used in this book was correct at the time ofwriting.All quoted extracts from the published books listed in the Bibliography areconsidered to be consistent with Fair Usage."},{"pageContent":"> 1. A Prescription for Illness: Dying to be Healthy> “Physicians who are free with their drugging keep themselves busy treating the> effects of the drugs.” Herbert Shelton ND DC The word ‘medicine’ has two applications, the establishment definitions forwhich are,> “the science or practice of the diagnosis, treatment or prevention of> disease.”And,> “any drug or preparation used for the treatment or prevention of disease.”The various drugs and preparations that are referred to as ‘medicines’ areconsidered to be essential, core components of the ‘healthcare’ provided bymedical practitioners to their patients. The inclusion in the definition of theword ‘science’ conveys the impression that the practice of medicine has a solidfoundation that is based on and fully supported by scientifically establishedevidence. The definition also conveys the impression that the use of drugs andpreparations is similarly science-based, and that ‘medicines’ are bothappropriate and effective for the purposes for which they are employed.Unfortunately, however, nothing could be further from the truth; any healthcarepractice that employs the use of ‘drugs and preparations’ in the treatment andprevention of disease has no basis in ‘science’, nor is it capable of restoringpatients to health.This statement will no doubt be considered by many to be outrageous; but thatdoes not deny its veracity, as will be demonstrated by the discussions in thischapter about the use of medicines for the treatment of disease. The use ofvaccinations for the prevention of disease is discussed in the next chapter.The medical establishment claims that there are many hundreds of differentdiseases, each of which is recognisable by its unique set of symptoms and eachof which is treatable with the appropriate ‘medicine’. The purpose of the‘medicine’ is to achieve the cessation of symptoms; an outcome that isinterpreted to mean that the disease has been successfully conquered by thetreatment.This, at least, is the theory; but in practice, in the real world, it is notuncommon for a wide variety of different outcomes to be experienced by patients,even though they have all been diagnosed with the same disease and treated withthe same medicine. The existence of such widely varying outcomes presents adirect challenge to the theory. Furthermore, although some patients mayexperience a complete cessation of their symptoms, this successful outcomecannot be attributed to the medicine, nor does it mean their health has beenrestored, for reasons that will be explained in later chapters.An interesting feature of the definition of medicine is the reference to the‘treatment’ rather than the ‘cure’ of disease; the reason for this is becausethe medical establishment states that many diseases are ‘incurable’. For thesediseases, they claim that the appropriate treatments will ‘manage’ the patients’conditions; which means that their symptoms will only be alleviated rather thaneliminated.It is widely acknowledged that all medicines produce ‘side effects’, which areeffectively new symptoms that are the direct result of the treatment. Thesignificance of this fact is inadequately reported and therefore insufficientlyappreciated by most people; it is, however, a core problem of the prevailingmedical system because the production of new symptoms is essentially thecreation of a new health problem.It is clear that the wide variation in the efficacy of medicines used astreatments for disease, as well as the additional symptoms they cause, raiseserious questions about the ability of these ‘treatments’ to restore a patientto a state of health; which ought to be the fundamental purpose and function ofa ‘healthcare’ system.The website of the WHO (World Health Organisation) provides a definition ofhealth that states,> “Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not> merely the absence of disease or infirmity.”This definition has remained unaltered since first declared in theirconstitution when the WHO was founded in 1948. The WHO is the agency of the UN(United Nations) assigned to be the ‘authority’ for health matters for all ofthe people in all of the countries that have ratified the WHO constitution. Inother words, the WHO directs health policies for implementation by virtuallyevery country around the world. Yet the WHO policy recommendations with respectto disease treatment almost exclusively refer to the use of ‘medicines’ that areacknowledged to alleviate symptoms but not cure disease.The WHO’s policies are clearly inconsistent with their objective to achievebetter health for everyone, everywhere; especially in the context of their owndefinition of ‘health’.Science is a process; it is a process that involves the study of differentaspects of the world in order to expand the level of human knowledge; it alsoentails the creation of hypotheses and theories to explain the various phenomenaobserved during the course of those scientific investigations. As the variousstudies progress and the body of knowledge increases, they may reveal newinformation or they may expose anomalies and contradictions within existinghypotheses and theories. In such instances, it is essential for scientists, inwhichever field they study, to reassess those hypotheses and theories in thelight of the new findings; a process that may necessitate revisions oradaptations to be made to prevailing theories. Sometimes the new information mayindicate a need to abandon existing theories and replace them with entirely newones, especially when new theories provide better and more compellingexplanations for the observed phenomena.The theories underlying the use of ‘medicine’ to treat disease can be shown tocontain many anomalies and contradictions; they are clearly in need of athorough reassessment. However, and more importantly, other theories exist thatpresent far more credible and compelling explanations for human illness and itscauses. These explanations also offer the means by which people can address thecauses of their illness, which can assist a full recovery from most conditionsof ill-health and help restore people to the state of good health, in the truemeaning of the word.It is neither intended nor necessary to provide a history of ‘medicine’; it isfar too vast a topic. Nevertheless, it is necessary to refer to certain aspectsof this history to identify the origins of the use of ‘medicine’ and outline itsprogression to the situation that prevails in the early 21st century, especiallyin view of the dominance of the healthcare system recommended by the WHO foradoption by all Member States.In various parts of the world and throughout history, a variety of ideas havearisen about the causes of illness and the appropriate measures to be taken totreat these conditions and restore health to the patient. However, all systemsof ‘medicine’ operate from the same basic principle, which is that a person whois ill requires ‘treatment’ with a certain substance that is said to have‘curative properties’ in order for the patient to recover their health.Some of the ancient customs and traditions relating to the treatment of peopleexhibiting symptoms of illness were based on beliefs in the existence ofmalevolent, supernatural influences, rather than earthly ones, and theseinvariably involved the use of ‘remedies’ of a similarly supernatural nature;they may have included spells or incantations or the use of special tokens toward off evil spirits. Other ancient customs and traditions employed an approachtowards illness and its treatment of a more earthbound variety; many of theremedies employed by these systems involved the use of various naturalsubstances, such as plants and similar materials that could be found locally andwere claimed to have curative properties.The medicinal use of plants has been documented in many regions of the world andrecorded to date back many thousands of years. For example, Ayurveda, theancient Indian system of medicine, is claimed to be approximately 5,000 yearsold. Similarly, TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) is also claimed to be manythousands of years old, although it is said to have its roots in Ayurveda, whichindicates that Ayurveda is the older of the two systems. Many of these ancientsystems also exerted their influence in other regions of the world; ancientGreek medicine, for example, is said to have been influenced by both Ayurvedaand ancient Egyptian medicine; the latter system was recorded and documented onpapyri, some of which have been dated to be a few thousand years old.Many of these ancient systems were holistic in nature, meaning that they treatedthe whole person rather than addressing any specific symptoms they experienced,but the treatments almost invariably involved the use of ‘remedies’ thatcontained ingredients claimed to have curative properties. These ingredientswere often derived from plants, or parts of plants, although in some instances,the substances used as ingredients were extracted from poisonous plants.Catharanthus roseus, for example, which is also known as rosy periwinkle, istoxic if eaten, but has been used by both Ayurveda and TCM for the treatment ofcertain health problems. Other remedies may have included ingredients that hadbeen extracted from certain body parts of particular animals.Although perceived to be in conflict with these ancient forms of traditionalmedicine, modern medicine has incorporated some of their methods. Thepharmaceutical industry has manufactured a number of drugs using syntheticderivatives of the ‘active ingredients’ of certain medicinal plants widely usedby practitioners of traditional medicine. Pharmaceutical drugs derived from therosy periwinkle, for example, are used within modern medicine for the treatmentof certain cancers.Some ancient systems of medicine and healing, such as Ayurveda and TCM, remainpopular and continue to be practised in the 21st century. However, although theycontain very useful ideas, especially with respect to the recognition that thehuman body should be considered holistically, they nevertheless retain some ofthe less useful ideas and methods, such as the use of animal parts and poisonousplants as ingredients of the medicines employed in the treatment of patients.Whilst there is abundant evidence to support the idea that a wide variety ofplants are suitable for consumption as foods, there is no evidence to supportthe idea that animal parts or poisonous plants have curative properties and canbe beneficial for human health.Hippocrates, the Greek physician who lived approximately 2,500 years ago, issometimes referred to as the ‘father of modern medicine’; he is said to havegained some of his knowledge from the ancient Egyptian system of medicine. Asubstantial proportion of Hippocrates’ writings about his ideas on the subjectof illnesses and their appropriate treatments has survived, and they provideuseful insights into the type of medical practices that were in existence at thetime. The ideas held by Hippocrates contained a mixture of strangeness andusefulness; the latter being demonstrated by his most famous saying that hasbeen translated as,> “Let your food be your medicine and your medicine be your food.”This simple statement demonstrates the widely acknowledged fact that food is animportant factor for health; as discussed in detail in chapter ten.The ‘strangeness’ of Hippocrates’ ideas can be illustrated by his theory thatillness was caused by an imbalance in what he referred to as the ‘four humours’,which are blood, phlegm, black bile and yellow bile. His recommendations for therestoration of health required correcting these imbalances and his methodsincluded such practices as purging and bloodletting. Unfortunately, neither ofthese practices is able to correct any genuine imbalance in the body or restorehealth, but both of them remained in use by practitioners of modern medicineuntil comparatively recently.It is reported that George Washington, the US President, received a number oftreatments that included the use of leeches for ‘bloodletting’, to relieve hiscold, the outcome of which was that he died in December 1799 at the age of only67 after more than half of his blood had been withdrawn from his body. There hasnever been any scientific evidence to support the efficacy of bloodletting,despite the fact that it was used as a ‘treatment’ for more than 2,000 years andhad been advocated and employed by many eminent physicians in their ownpractices. Although leeches remain in use in modern medicine, their purpose isto assist blood flow and prevent clots, rather than to draw large quantities ofa patient’s blood.The ancient practices of ‘medicine’ continued in the Western world with littlechange until the ‘Medical Renaissance’ that began during the early 15th century.One of the key contributors of the 16th century to this renaissance is the Swissphysician, Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, better known asParacelsus, who is still held in high esteem by the medical establishment forhis pioneering medical theories. The theories for which Paracelsus is best knownhave not, however, contributed to improved healthcare. On the contrary, theyhave impeded its progress because they placed an emphasis on the practice offighting disease; a practice that remains a core function of modern medicine,but is nevertheless erroneous; fighting disease is not synonymous with restoringhealth.One of his theories claims that the human body is a chemical system that becomes‘imbalanced’ when a person is ill; an idea that is clearly similar to that ofHippocrates. Although not entirely incorrect, this idea has had disastrousconsequences because of the substances used to address such imbalances. Thesolution Paracelsus proposed to correct the imbalance associated with thedisease known as ‘syphilis’ involved the use of mercury, which he bothrecommended and used in the treatment of his patients. Paracelsus was not theoriginator of the idea that syphilis should be treated with mercury; thatdubious honour belongs to Giorgio Sommariva, whose practice in the late 1490sinvolved the use of cinnabar. The contribution of Paracelsus to the treatment ofsyphilis was the formulation of a mercury ointment.Another theory, and the one for which Paracelsus is probably best known, isencapsulated by the phrase ‘the poison is in the dose’; it is this theory thatforms the basis of the idea that toxic substances are suitable for use as‘medicines’, with the proviso that they are administered in the ‘right dose’.This theory also provides the justification for the use of toxic substances forother purposes, as will be discussed in later chapters. Although sometimesmisquoted, the words attributed to Paracelsus have been translated into Englishas follows,> “All things are poison and nothing is without poison; it is only the dose that> makes a thing not a poison.”Again, nothing could be further from the truth; all things are not poison.Contrary to the claims of the medical establishment, the idea that the ‘right’dose of medicine is therapeutic but the ‘wrong’ dose is harmful, is erroneous; asubstance cannot change its inherent nature in relation to the quantity in whichit is used. In his book entitled Natural Hygiene: Man’s Pristine Way of Life,Herbert Shelton ND DC underlines this point succinctly in the statement that,> “Poisons are such qualitatively and not merely quantitatively.”The only variations that occur due to the ‘dose’ of a poison relate to theextent of the effects it will produce and the degree of harm it will cause.Throughout the 16th century, the physicians of many European countries continuedto follow the work of Hippocrates, whose writings were studied by medicalstudents in England, for example, and used as the basis for their qualificationas medical doctors. There were two English medical colleges at that period; theRoyal College of Surgeons that was founded in 1505 and the Royal College ofPhysicians that was founded in 1518.Dr Thomas Sydenham MD, a 17th century physician who is widely regarded as the‘English Hippocrates’, is also a source of both useful and harmful ideas; one ofthe latter was the appropriateness of mercury for the treatment of syphilis;this clearly demonstrates the level of influence that the work of Paracelsus hadalready begun to exert in the field of medicine.The 16th and 17th centuries were a period during which science flourished,especially in Europe where scientific organisations such as the Royal Society,which was founded in 1660 to discuss scientific questions, were formed toprovide repositories for the various writings of scientists about their work andtheir discoveries. The scientific advancements made during this period includedmany new discoveries and technologies as well as significant improvements toexisting technologies, such as the microscope for example. The new and improvedtechnologies were particularly useful tools that scientists utilised in theirlaboratory experiments, which they claimed provided the means by which theirtheories could be established and proven scientifically.This period, known as the ‘Scientific Revolution’, was the era during whichscientists also discovered new chemical elements and developed new chemicalcompounds, both of which provided further opportunities for scientificexperimentation. The prevailing idea that the human body was essentially achemical system that needed to be ‘balanced’ encouraged the use of chemicals ina wide variety of experiments in the field of medicine; a practice thatcontinues to be the mainstay of medical science, and especially medicalresearch, in the early 21st century.This era that contained the ‘Medical Renaissance’ and the ‘ScientificRevolution’ extended into the 18th century and fostered the growth of an elitistattitude, especially within the field of ‘medicine’. Although this attitudepredominated amongst those in charge of the medical organisations, such asmedical colleges, qualified physicians soon began to hold a similar view of thesystem under which they had been trained. These men, because women rarelytrained as physicians prior to the 19th century, sought to promote their medicalsystem as the only ‘true’ system of healthcare as it was the only one groundedin science-based evidence.Whilst this period is generally claimed to be the beginning of ‘medicalscience’, it was, in fact, the beginning of medical dogma.The medical establishment promulgates the view that science-based medicine ledto the overthrow of ‘quackery’, despite the fact that this ‘scientific’ systementails the use of toxic substances in the treatment of disease. It should benoted that the definition of quackery includes reference to unfounded claimsabout the ability of substances to treat disease; the significance of thisdescription will become increasingly apparent throughout the discussions in thischapter. It should also be noted that the treatment of syphilis withmercury-based compounds continued into the early 20th century, despite the lackof evidence that mercury has the ability to ‘heal’ this disease. There is,however, an abundance of evidence which demonstrates that mercury, like allother toxic substances, causes a great deal of harm and can even lead to death.Europe was by no means the only region in which an elitist attitude was fosteredtowards the science-based medical system. In her book entitled Death by ModernMedicine, Dr Carolyn Dean MD ND refers to the situation in Canada and statesthat,> “Allopathic doctors began amassing power as early as 1759. At that time,> legislation was drafted to protect an ‘unsuspecting public’ against quacks or> ‘snake oil salesmen’.”The orthodox, or allopathic, system nevertheless employed practices that had notbeen scientifically established as having the ability to assist a patient’srecovery to its natural state of health; some of the unpleasant practices theyused continued into the 19th century, as described by Herbert Shelton in NaturalHygiene,> “…patients were bled, blistered, purged, puked, narcotized, mercurialised and> alcoholised into chronic invalidism or into the grave.”Many of these ‘treatments’ were a continuation of traditional practices thatdate back at least to the time of Hippocrates, if not earlier. But, as stated,these treatments frequently resulted in the death of the patient; a fact thatdemonstrates both their lack of efficacy and their dangerous nature. The harmcaused by these practices and the substances used as ‘medicine’ did not gounnoticed, as Herbert Shelton reports,> “It was well known to the physicians of the period that their drugs were> damaging.”The continuing use of these drugs, despite the knowledge that they were harmful,demonstrates the failure of the ‘scientific’ system to recognise the utterfallacy of the idea that ‘poisons’ can be ‘therapeutic’. The medical system inwhich they had been trained had not equipped physicians to provide ‘healthcare’for their patients, nor did it protect patients from the harm caused by medicaltreatments.Nevertheless, the proponents of ‘scientific medicine’ sought to increase theirdominance during the 19th century by further developing their system andcreating more formal training procedures for the qualification of physicians. Tostrengthen their dominance, they also implemented the doctrine that only thosephysicians trained under their ‘scientific’ system would be regarded as the‘real’ doctors, and that anyone not trained under that system would be referredto as ‘quacks’.The formalisation of the ‘medical system’ in England, for example, led to thefounding of the BMA (British Medical Association) in 1832, although under adifferent name until 1855. The purpose of this organisation was, according tothe BMA web page entitled The History of the BMA, to provide,> “…a ‘friendly and scientific’ forum where doctors could advance and exchange> medical knowledge.”The BMA web pages that detail its history refer to their campaign against‘quackery’ in the early 19th century. The term ‘quackery’ was, and still is,used to discredit all forms of ‘healing’ other than those of modern medicine.Yet it was that very same 19th century medical system, which claimed to opposequackery, that employed ‘medicines’ known to be harmful and often led to apatient’s invalidism or death.The practice of medicine has clearly not changed a great deal since the days ofHippocrates, after whom the Hippocratic Oath that urges doctors to ‘do no harm’is named. This Oath is still sworn by newly qualified doctors and it is alaudable principle on which to base any work in the field of ‘healthcare’. Butthe use of harmful substances in the name of ‘healthcare’ denies physicians theability to apply that principle in practice; as this chapter will demonstrate.Although the medical establishment continues to repudiate the idea that‘medicines’ are harmful, with the sole exception of ‘side effects’, there havebeen many individual physicians who have become aware of and concerned about theproblems inherent within the system in which they were trained. As a result oftheir investigations, many of these physicians were brave enough to reject some,if not all, of their ‘training’ and to develop and utilise other methods of‘healing’, many of which resulted in vastly improved outcomes for theirpatients. One such physician was Dr John Tilden MD, who discusses hisexperiences in his book entitled Toxemia Explained, in which he states that,> “Twenty-five years in which I used drugs, and thirty-three in which I have not> used drugs, should make my belief that drugs are unnecessary, and in most> cases injurious, worth something to those who care to know the truth.”Most people will probably assume that the ‘medical system’ of the early 21stcentury is based on solid scientific evidence, unlike the systems of earlierperiods; but this would be a mistaken assumption. The system of modern medicinecurrently in use has been developed as the result of a variety of customs andtraditions, none of which has been scientifically established to be appropriatefor the treatment of a patient’s illness in order to restore them to health.Furthermore, the ‘medical science’ of the 21st century is predominantlyconducted in the laboratories of pharmaceutical companies; but laboratoryexperimentation does not provide ‘scientific proof’ that the use of modernpharmaceutical medicines is either safe or effective. On the contrary, there isa large and growing body of evidence that demonstrates quite clearly that‘medicines’ are not only ineffective as treatments for illness but they are alsocapable of producing harm and causing death.Modern MedicinesIn Death by Modern Medicine, Dr Dean provides a detailed exposé of the problemswith ‘modern medicine’, and states that,> “Drugs are synonymous with modern medicine.”The definition of ‘medicine’ cited at the beginning of this chapter refers tothe treatment of disease through use of a ‘drug’, the establishment definitionof which is,> “any substance that affects the structure or functioning of a living> organism.”This definition highlights an extremely significant point, which is that thepurpose of drugs, or medicines, is to affect the functioning of a livingorganism. Although it is intended to convey the impression that they are‘therapeutic’, in reality, the effects produced by drugs are far frombeneficial.Medicines are produced in laboratories from chemical compounds; however,although chemistry is certainly a science, this does not mean that the use ofchemicals to treat disease can be called ‘medical science’. The relevant branchof ‘science’ that pertains to drugs is pharmacology, which is defined by theestablishment as,> “the science of the properties of drugs and their effects on the body.”The pharmaceutical industry, which is immensely profitable, relies on theresearch conducted within the field of pharmacology for their continuingexistence and their domination of the manufacture of the ‘medicines’ used by thepractitioners of modern medicine.Most definitions of the word ‘drug’ indicate that it can refer to either a‘legal’ or an ‘illegal’ substance; this is significant because it illustratesthat the ‘action’ of all drugs is effectively the same; in other words, they allhave the ability to affect the functioning of a living organism. In fact, some‘legal’ drugs, Ritalin and Adderall for example, have very similar chemicalcompositions to some ‘illegal’ drugs. Although the terms ‘drug’ and ‘medicine’may be used interchangeably, the medical establishment understandably prefers touse the latter term with reference to the substances employed as treatments fordisease, due to the frequent association of the word ‘drug’ with illegalsubstances. Their preference for the word ‘medicine’ also helps to convey theimpression that the effects produced by them are ‘therapeutic’; this is however,a false impression.The human body is, to a certain extent, ‘chemical’ in nature, but the chemicalsrequired by the human body need to be in a very specific form in order to bemetabolised and utilised for the body’s physiological functions. The chemicalcompounds synthesised in the laboratories of pharmaceutical companies andproduced as medicines are not appropriate for the human body, because, asHerbert Shelton explains,> “All drugs are physiologically incompatible with the functions of the body.”The stated purpose of ‘medicine’ is to ‘fight’ disease by affecting thestructure and functioning of the body. Any substance that adversely affects thebody’s structure or is physiologically incompatible with the body and itsfunctions is, however, poisonous to the body; as indicated by the establishmentdefinition of ‘poison’ which refers to,> “any substance that irritates, damages, or impairs the activity of the body’s> tissues.”The medical establishment inevitably promotes the idea that ‘medicines’ onlyinterfere beneficially, with the sole proviso that they are administered in thecorrect ‘dose’ to exert their therapeutic actions. However, as has been stated,a substance cannot change its nature solely by reference to the quantity inwhich it is used.The manufacture of medicines involves a number of different stages, the first ofwhich may include the isolation of the active ingredient of a plant claimed tohave curative properties and its synthesis into a chemical compound. Thepharmaceutical industry produces huge numbers of chemical compounds, each ofwhich is subjected to a variety of tests in order to determine its effects on‘disease’. Until recently, the tests to determine the effects of these compoundswere conducted on tissues claimed to have been affected by a particular disease;the purpose of the tests is to discover if the compound is able to alter thetissue and counter the disease process. If any effects are observed that areconsidered to be ‘beneficial’, further tests are conducted to discover whetherthe compounds that produced those effects could be incorporated into thedevelopment of a marketable product; a ‘medicine’.Some pharmaceutical companies report that they no longer use diseased tissue forthis type of testing and that instead, they now use ‘disease molecules’, whichcan be molecules of genetic material, either DNA or RNA, or protein molecules.The laboratories of the pharmaceutical industry contain many thousands, if notmillions, of chemical compounds that are tested against various diseasemolecules. These tests are conducted using highly technical equipment,particularly robotics that have the capability of performing incredibly largenumbers of tests at an extremely rapid rate. The purpose of the testing remainsthe same, which is to ascertain whether any chemical produces an ‘effect’ on anyof the disease molecules that can be interpreted as ‘beneficial’ with theultimate objective of developing a ‘medicine’.It is entirely possible that any number of chemical compounds may produce an‘effect’ on a piece of genetic material or on a protein molecule in a cellculture in a laboratory. However, the idea that effects produced by chemicalcompounds on isolated molecules can be extrapolated to indicate that thosecompounds may have a beneficial effect in a living human being is totallyinappropriate for a number of reasons. One of the main reasons is that, whentested, disease molecules are no longer in their natural environment within thehuman body; an environment that is poorly understood by the medicalestablishment, which perceives the human body to be little more than a livingmachine comprised of various parts, each of which can be studied and, if foundto be diseased, ‘fixed’ through the use of chemicals without reference to anyother part.The work of the pharmaceutical industry is clearly an extension of the work ofHippocrates, Paracelsus and others who have claimed that the body is essentiallychemical in nature and that these chemicals need to be ‘balanced’ when the bodyis ill. Although partly true, this idea has resulted in the use of syntheticchemical compounds that are physiologically incompatible with the human body forthe treatment of disease. The long history of erroneous ideas about the livinghuman body continues to exert a detrimental influence on the ability of themedical establishment to change its approach and gain a better understanding of‘health’ and of ‘disease’.‘Science’ is, or should be, a process of investigation; and the scientificmethod should involve procedures that ‘follow the evidence’.In ‘medical science’, the evidence from observations in the real world is oftenpoorly explained or even unexplained by the theories. For example, theexperience of Dr John Tilden, as quoted at the end of the previous section, wasthat his patients recovered from illness when they stopped using ‘drugs’; anexperience that completely contradicts the theories of modern medicine, butnevertheless qualifies as empirical evidence that should not be ignored.Unfortunately, instead of abandoning their erroneous theories in the light ofcontradictory empirical evidence, the medical establishment has established themas medical dogma and anyone who dares to question this ‘orthodoxy’ is subjectedto vilification. In order to dominate the field of ‘medicine’, the medicalestablishment has created a medical system that perceives itself to be ‘elite’and condemns any other views, as demonstrated by the BMA and their campaignagainst ‘quackery’. This attitude is inculcated into medical students duringtheir training, as experienced by Dr Carolyn Dean, who explains in Death byModern Medicine that,> “In fact, we were told many times that if we didn’t learn it in medical school> it must be quackery.”There are, however, many problems with the information taught in medicalschools, especially with respect to pharmacology and the study of the effects ofdrugs within the human body.Once a chemical compound has been observed in the laboratory to produce what isperceived to be a beneficial effect on tissues or ‘disease molecules’, it issubjected to various tests to determine the effects on living organisms;laboratory animals initially, then small groups of healthy human volunteers. Thepurpose of these tests is to determine the ‘therapeutic dose’ and to ascertainthe extent of any ‘side effects’ of the drug. But these tests cannot beconsidered to provide ‘proof’ that the chemical compound has any benefits forhuman health; especially as none of the volunteers at this stage of testing hasthe ‘disease’ that the drug is believed to be able to treat.There are two branches of pharmacology; pharmacodynamics, which entails thestudy of the effects of drugs on living organisms, and pharmacokinetics, whichentails the study of the actions of living organisms on drugs. However, as thediscussions in this book will demonstrate, the only effect of drugs is that ofpoisoning the body and the only actions of the body involve efforts to expel thedrugs.The medical establishment claims that medicines have the ability to ‘target’ thediseased part of the body; but this is not the case, as indicated by a June 2011article entitled Targeted drug delivery to tumors: Myths, reality andpossibility. Although this article refers to the delivery of drugs to a tumour,the underlying principle is the same; but the article reveals that,> “Current drug delivery systems, however, do not have the ability to guide> themselves to a target.”This means, therefore, that drugs are able to affect parts of the body that arenot diseased or affected by disease. It is claimed that the bloodstream isincluded in the delivery system by which drugs reach the diseased parts of thebody; but the idea that the bloodstream is merely a transport system iserroneous. Although its functions include the delivery of nutrients and theremoval of toxins, the blood is affected by all of the substances that enter thebody; it will therefore be poisoned by toxic materials. The misleading nature ofthe information promulgated about ‘blood poisoning’ is discussed in chapterthree.There is a wealth of evidence from a variety of sources to demonstrate that‘modern medicine’ is not based on ‘science’; some of that evidence can begleaned from the medical establishment itself. For example, in October 1991,Richard Smith, then editor of the prestigious British Medical Journal (BMJ),wrote an editorial entitled Where is the Wisdom? The Poverty of MedicalEvidence, in which he states that,> “There are perhaps 30,000 biomedical journals in the world...”This clearly represents an impossibly huge volume of material for doctors toread, but the quantity of medical reading matter is not the real crux of theproblem. The editorial refers to a medical conference that had been held inManchester during the previous week. One of the speakers at that event wasProfessor David Eddy of Duke University, whom Richard Smith quotes as havingsaid that,> “…only about 15% of medical interventions are supported by solid, scientific> evidence…”Richard Smith then continues in his own words to state that,> “This is partly because only 1% of the articles in medical journals are> scientifically sound, and partly because many of the treatments have never> been assessed at all.”These revelations run counter to the claim that modern medicine is a ‘science’and that treatments have all been scientifically ‘proven’ to be both safe andeffective.This editorial is, however, by no means the only instance of an admission by themedical establishment about the inherent problems with their assertions that‘medicines’ are safe and effective. It is widely acknowledged that ‘risks’ areassociated with the use of medicines, as explained by Dr Dean in Death by ModernMedicine in her reference to a report produced by the US GAO (General AccountingOffice), which found that,> “…of the 198 drugs approved by the FDA between 1976 and 1985...102 (or 51.1%)> had serious post-approval risks…”The ‘risks’ listed in the report include heart failure, kidney and liverfailure, and birth defects, which provide clear evidence of the dangers that canresult from ‘approved’ drugs. The fact that these serious conditions had notbeen identified prior to the approval of the drugs indicates serious problemswith the drug testing procedures, as well as with the original considerationthat the compounds were appropriate for use as a medicine. Professor SheldonKrimsky PhD offers a suggestion, in his book entitled Science in the PrivateInterest, of the reason why questions are not raised over drug testingprocedures; he states that,> “Among the tens of thousands of clinical trials occurring each year, most are> funded by for-profit companies seeking to gain FDA approval for new drugs,> clinical procedures or medical devices.”This situation is not improving; it is, in fact, a worsening problem, as will bedemonstrated by the discussions in chapter nine, that refer to the increasinglevel of control over the medical system that has been gained by profit-seekingpharmaceutical companies and other vested interests.A large proportion of pharmaceuticals are manufactured by American drugcompanies, which means they require approval by the US FDA (Food and DrugAdministration). It is likely that the vast majority of people assume that thisapproval process means that all drugs on the market have been scientificallyproven to be both safe and effective, because it is only after approval thatdrugs can become available for prescription to patients. It should be expected,therefore, that the FDA conducts its own rigorous tests prior to approving anydrug as a suitable ‘medicine’ for public consumption.Unfortunately, this is not the case, as Dr David Michaels PhD explains in hisbook entitled Doubt is Their Product,> “Under the US system, the pertinent regulatory agency – the Food and Drug> Administration (FDA) – grants licenses for new medications based on its review> of the various laboratory tests and clinical trials reported by the companies> themselves. The FDA can study the data and the results as reported, but it has> neither the staff nor the resources to duplicate the work itself.”There are many problems with the drug industry’s approach to the development ofa ‘medicine’. The first is that the initial ‘effect’ is merely an isolatedchemical reaction within a laboratory environment. Secondly, as will bediscussed in detail in chapter five, many laboratory animals that are used fortesting exhibit certain functional differences from humans. Thirdly, all ‘drugs’have effects in addition to those that are intended; these are called ‘sideeffects’ and include a variety of symptoms that demonstrate the harm that theycan cause; this topic is discussed in more detail in the next section.Pharmaceutical ‘medicines’ are, however, harmful; the reason for this is due tothe nature of the chemicals used in their manufacture, many of which areinherently toxic and all of them are physiologically incompatible with the humanbody.One extremely useful document that explains the manufacturing processes and theingredients used by the pharmaceutical industry is called Pharmaceutical WasteAnalysis. This document was produced in 2006 by the Blacksmith Institute and isavailable from their website (blacksmithinstitute.org); the Institute changedits name in 2015 to Pure Earth (pureearth.org).One of the pharmaceutical manufacturing processes, called ‘fermentation’, isemployed in the production of antibiotics and steroids; two of the most widelyused drugs. The process of fermentation involves the use of solvents, some ofwhich are discussed in the Pharmaceutical Waste document that states,> “…the solvents most often used in fermentation operations are acetone,> methanol, isopropanol, ethanol, amyl alcohol and MIBK.”All of these solvents are toxic. MIBK stands for methyl isobutyl ketone, whichis claimed to be of ‘low toxicity’, although the document states that it maydamage the liver, which clearly refutes the claim of ‘low’ toxicity.Another pharmaceutical manufacturing process is called ‘chemical synthesis’,which is the production method used for most of the active ingredients in a widevariety of drugs; this process also involves a number of highly toxic substancesas the Pharmaceutical Waste document explains,> “A variety of priority pollutants are used as reaction and purification> solvents during chemical synthesis.”The document provides a list of some of the ‘priority pollutants’ that are usedin the process of chemical synthesis; they include,> “…benzene, chlorobenzene, chloroform, chloromethane, o-dichlorobenzene,> 1,2-dichloroethane, methylene chloride, phenol, toluene and cyanide.”The term ‘priority pollutants’ means that these substances are known to beextremely hazardous chemical compounds.The processes described above are not the only ones used in the production of‘medicines’; but they serve as examples to demonstrate that the manufacture ofdrugs involves the use of highly toxic substances. The concern expressed by thedocument refers to the hazardous nature of the waste produced by the industryand the effects of these wastes on the environment; this topic is discussed indetail in chapter six.The information contained within the document clearly identifies the toxicnature of the substances used in the manufacturing processes, as well as theingredients utilised by the pharmaceutical industry in the production of‘medicine’, and provides supportive evidence for the claim that medicines areinherently harmful. This fact has also been identified by Herbert Shelton whostates that,> “All so-called medicines, in doses of any size, are poisons.”It is therefore unsurprising that all drugs are recognised to produce ‘sideeffects’; but the degree of harm is invariably understated and mostly hidden,for reasons that will become increasingly obvious throughout this book. Thescale of harm they cause is the subject of the next discussion.IatrogenesisIatrogenesis, which is derived from the Greek word for doctor, is a recognisedphenomenon, the establishment definition of which refers to a condition that,> “…has resulted from treatment, as either an unforeseen or inevitable> side-effect.”The ‘medicines’ of the early 21st century are perceived to be a ‘modern miracle’for their ability to combat the many hundreds of different diseases to whichhumans are able to succumb. A substantial part of this ‘miracle’ is regarded ashaving been achieved through advances in ‘medical science’ coupled with the useof highly sophisticated technologies. But, as outlined in the previous twodiscussions, ‘modern medicine’ was not established from a basis in science andthe effects of drugs have not been proven to be beneficial for health. Theexistence of the phenomenon of iatrogenesis demonstrates that medical treatmentscan, and do, have serious consequences.Dr Carolyn Dean is one of the many physicians who have recognised the failingsof the orthodox medical system in which they were trained. In Death by ModernMedicine, she refers to the history of the use of chemicals in ‘medicine’ andstates that,> “From the beginning, chemical drugs promised much more than they delivered.> But far beyond not working, the drugs also caused incalculable side effects.”The establishment definition of a ‘side-effect’ refers to,> “an unwanted effect produced by a drug in addition to its desired therapeutic> effects. Side-effects are often undesirable and may be harmful.”The description of an iatrogenic condition as a ‘side effect’ is clearlymisleading, because it is a condition that is recognised to have resulted from a‘treatment’; in other words, it is a direct effect of treatment. An iatrogeniccondition is obviously not the intended effect of any treatment, but to relegateit to the label of ‘side effect’ is disingenuous; especially since all drugs arerecognised to produce effects, many of which are far more harmful than theoriginal disease.No ‘side effect’ is desirable, but the fact that they occur and are described as‘unforeseen’, ‘unwanted’ and ‘undesirable’ is a clear demonstration of awoefully inadequate level of knowledge within pharmacology, and especiallywithin pharmacodynamics.The reason that patients are prescribed the same pharmaceutical drugs for thesame condition is based on a mistaken idea about the processes that result in‘disease’. This fallacy assumes that all human responses to the same diseasewill be uniform, because it is claimed that a ‘disease’ is an independent entitythat ‘attacks’ all people alike, and therefore the appropriate treatment is onethat will fight the disease entity. This fallacy is also the basis for the useof tissues or ‘disease molecules’ in laboratory experiments.Although it is likely that there will be certain similarities in the effectsthat people experience from the same drug, humans are not ‘machines’; no twohuman bodies are exactly the same and therefore their experiences will notexactly correlate. The medical establishment claims that the reason some peopleexperience adverse effects, whereas others do not, is because they have a‘problem’. The most common explanation for this problem is that these peoplehave ‘faulty genes’; but this is yet another mistaken idea. The informationproduced by the Human Genome Project has undermined many fundamental assumptionsabout the importance and role of genes in the human body.The medical establishment does acknowledge that people react differently todrugs, as Richard Smith explains in his previously cited October 1991 editorial,> “The weakness of the scientific evidence underlying medical practice is one of> the causes of the wide variations that are well recognised in medical> practice.”It is not only the evidence that is weak, the theories underlying medicalpractice are also weak because they fail to recognise the real nature of thehuman body, which is a self-regulating organism that is far from inert,machine-like and predictable.The symptoms called ‘side effects’ that are produced by a ‘medicine’ are likelyto be viewed as a new condition, or illness, for which the patient will often beprescribed another ‘medicine’, but this too will inevitably produce another setof ‘side effects’. This recurring problem is summarised by Herbert Shelton, whostates,> “There are no drugs that do not produce side effects and it is certain that> the more toxic of them invariably produce iatrogenic disease.”It is therefore more appropriate to state that all ‘effects’ of all drugs shouldbe referred to as iatrogenesis.One of the first analyses of the scale of the problem of ‘iatrogenesis’ in theUS was conducted by Dr Barbara Starfield MD and reported in her July 2000article entitled Is US Health Really the Best in the World? that was publishedin the Journal of the American Medical Association. In her article, Dr Starfieldwrote about the dreadful state of healthcare and included details of the rankingof the US by comparison to other countries in respect of certain criteria. Forexample, the US ranked 12th out of 13 ‘Western’ countries with respect to lifeexpectancy; an appalling situation considering the huge sums of money spent onhealthcare in the US.The quality of healthcare for Americans has continued to worsen since 2000, asindicated by a November 2013 article entitled We’re No 26! US below average onmost health measures; the title is self-explanatory.In her article, Dr Starfield exposed a range of problems including the high costof healthcare and the low ranking of the US in health criteria. She alsorevealed important statistics about adverse effects that have been the directresult of ‘healthcare’ interventions; these statistics include 12,000 deaths peryear from unnecessary surgery and 7,000 deaths per year from medication errorsin hospital. Her comment on this situation is that,> “The high cost of the health care system is considered to be a deficit, but> seems to be tolerated under the assumption that better health results from> more expensive care, despite evidence from a few studies indicating that as> many as 20% to 30% of patients receive contraindicated care.”One of the statistics provided in the article is of particular relevance to thisdiscussion, as Dr Starfield reports that an annual total of 106,000 deathsoccurred as the result of ‘non-error adverse effects of medications’; whichrefers to medications that had been correctly and appropriately prescribed andadministered. This particular statistic provides unequivocal evidence not onlyof the existence of iatrogenesis, but also of the potentially vast scale of theproblem.The first comprehensive study to be conducted on the subject of iatrogenesis inthe US was published in 2003. This study, entitled Death by Medicine, collatedstatistics from thousands of published studies on all causes of illness; it wasco-authored by Dr Gary Null PhD, Dr Carolyn Dean MD ND, Dr Martin Feldman MD, DrDebora Rasio MD and Dr Dorothy Smith PhD. The abstract of the study begins,> “A definitive review and close reading of medical peer-review journals and> government health statistics shows that American medicine frequently causes> more harm than good.”The total number of deaths from iatrogenesis was stated in this study to be anestimated 783,936 per year; a figure that exceeds the annual mortality fromeither heart disease or cancer, which makes iatrogenesis the leading cause ofdeath in the US. Death is clearly the most extreme iatrogenic effect; but thereare many other adverse health events that can follow the administration ofpharmaceutical drugs, as the study states,> “Each year approximately 2.2 million US hospital patients experience adverse> drugs reactions to prescribed medications.”It must be emphasised that these figures only refer to the situation in the USand only relate to hospital patients.The existence of huge numbers of adverse events resulting from the use of drugsis an absolutely unacceptable component of a ‘healthcare’ system. But even thesenumbers do not represent the full extent of the problem, as it is not restrictedto the US; it is a worldwide phenomenon that exists wherever pharmaceuticaldrugs are used.The fact that the worldwide effect of this phenomenon has not been studied anddocumented does not mean that it is not a genuine situation and a real problem.Furthermore, it is acknowledged that these statistics are not representative ofthe true situation, because adverse effects are known to be grosslyunderreported, as the study also states,> “As few as 5% and no more than 20% of iatrogenic acts are ever reported.”In the 2008 edition of her Death by Modern Medicine book, Dr Carolyn Dean, alsoone of the 2003 study authors, reports that the numbers of iatrogenic deaths andinjuries have continued to increase. The current scale of the problem isunknown, but in view of the ever-increasing consumption of pharmaceutical drugsaround the world, it is inevitable that it will have continued to escalate.Although the pharmaceutical industry is clearly reluctant to admit that theirproducts are toxic, there is undeniable evidence of the harm they cause, asdocumented by the many drugs that have been withdrawn from the market due totheir adverse effects, as Dr Dean explains,> “Fully half the drugs prescribed are eventually pulled from the marketplace> due to undeniable side effects.”Her statement is based on the US GAO report referred to in the previous section.However, because pharmaceutical drugs are not officially recognised as beinginherently toxic, the true scale of the problem is not only unknown, butunknowable. An added complication that further masks the magnitude of theproblem is that the ‘effects’ of drugs are not always immediately obvious andcan take months or even years to develop, which means it is highly unlikely thatan illness will be associated with the prior use of any medication.It is abundantly obvious that iatrogenesis has far more victims than has beenacknowledged or reported, but this situation is predominantly due to thesuppression of facts about the toxicity of pharmaceutical products, which is thedirect result of the toxic chemicals used in the manufacturing processes.‘Medicines’ are supposed to heal not harm; yet, as Dr Dean states,> “How modern medicine has come to be the number one killer in North America is> as incredible as it is horrifying. Doctors certainly don’t think of themselves> as killers but as long as they promote toxic drugs and don’t learn non‐toxic> options, they are pulling the trigger on helpless patients.”This is a dire situation; but it is not unique to North America; it will existwithin all countries that adopt the WHO-led medical establishment system.It is clear that expensive ‘healthcare’ does not result in better health forpeople; it does however, provide healthy profits for the pharmaceutical andmedical technology industries. The existence of iatrogenesis demonstrates that ahealth system based on the use of toxic pharmaceutical ‘medicines’ is unable todeliver healthcare, no matter how much money is spent, how sophisticated thetechnology or how new and innovative the drugs that are used.Health is not something that will improve by merely increasing healthcarebudgets or by spending larger amounts of money on the development of new‘medicines’, as the American system has proved. Health can only be improved byidentifying and addressing the real causes of illness.Psychiatric MedicationsThe establishment definition of psychopharmacology refers to,> “the study of the effects of drugs on mental processes and behaviour,> particularly psychotropic drugs.”The chemical compounds that are used in ‘medicines’ affect many parts of thebody including the brain; this means that the brain can be affected by‘medicines’ prescribed for conditions other than those referred to as ‘mentalhealth’ problems.The reason that a branch of ‘science’ studies the effects of pharmaceuticaldrugs on ‘mental processes and behaviours’ is because certain ‘behaviours’ areconsidered to be ‘abnormal’ and therefore people who exhibit such behaviours aredeemed to have a ‘mental illness’, also referred to as a ‘mental disorder’; asindicated by the April 2018 WHO fact sheet entitled Mental Disorders thatstates,> “There are many different mental disorders, with different presentations. They> are generally characterized by a combination of abnormal thoughts,> perceptions, emotions, behaviour and relationships with others.”The problem with this statement is that it relies on a highly subjectiveanalysis of what is perceived to be ‘abnormal’ with reference to all thecriteria by which a diagnosis is made. Yet nowhere is there a definitivedefinition of ‘normal’; it is neither a medical nor a scientific term.Nevertheless, when a person’s thoughts or behaviours are considered to be‘abnormal’ and they are diagnosed with a ‘mental disorder’ they are frequentlyprescribed ‘medications’ which, like all ‘drugs’, are made using toxicchemicals. The fact sheet suggests that insufficient numbers receive suchtreatments and states,> “Health systems have not yet adequately responded to the burden of mental> disorders. As a consequence, the gap between the need for treatment and its> provision is wide all over the world.”The definition of ‘health’ as declared in the WHO constitution, includesreference to mental as well as physical well-being, which further demonstratesthe disparity between the ideas they promote and the practices they recommend.It is another example of the contradictions that pervade the medicalestablishment system.The use of drugs for the treatment of people diagnosed with a mental disorder isbased on the theory that people with such conditions have developed a‘biochemical imbalance’ within their brain. Despite its frequent use, the phrase‘chemical imbalance in the brain’ is based on yet another unproven theory, aspsychiatrist Dr Peter Breggin MD has explained many times during the course ofhis long and distinguished career. His website contains a great deal of usefulmaterial and articles, including his June 2015 article entitled RationalPrinciples of Psychopharmacology for Therapists, Healthcare Providers andClients, in which he refers to the theory of ‘biochemical imbalance’ as beingboth false and a myth. In his article, he states that,> “…the evidence for any biological basis for ‘psychiatric disorders’ is utterly> lacking.”In his 1991 book entitled Toxic Psychiatry, Dr Breggin explains the situation inmore detail and states that,> “…no causal relationship has ever been established between a specific> biochemical state of the brain and any specific behaviour and it is simplistic> to assume it is possible.”He further explains that,> “There’s little evidence for the existence of any such imbalances and> absolutely no way to demonstrate how the drugs would affect them if they did> exist.”One fact that is rarely highlighted by the medical establishment is thatpatients undergo no tests that are able to determine whether they have abiochemical imbalance in their brains. Dr Breggin states that the only testscapable of determining the existence of any biochemical imbalance would only becarried out during an autopsy!In his June 2015 article Dr Breggin explains why drugs appear to have an effect,> “All drugs that impact on the brain and mind ‘work’ by partially disabling the> brain and mind.”He further explains that,> “The so-called therapeutic effect is always a disability.”He describes these disabilities as always representing a diminished quality oflife. Dr Breggin’s comments clearly add further credence to the discussion inthe previous section, in which it was shown that all drugs produce adverseeffects; the interpretation of these effects as ‘therapeutic’ is not only highlysubjective, it has no basis in ‘science’.One of the most common types of ‘mental disorder’ is depression, theestablishment definition of which is,> “a mental state characterized by excessive sadness.”The problem with this definition, as should be immediately obvious, is that ittoo is based on a subjective interpretation of the level of sadness that wouldconstitute ‘excessive’. It is highly likely that different physicians will havediffering interpretations of the meaning of ‘excessive’, which means that the‘treatments’ offered to patients can vary amongst physicians according to theirparticular and personal interpretations. Not only does this highlight theabsence of a standardised healthcare system, but also refutes any idea thatphysicians are in possession of a clear definition of ‘normal’ by which they candetermine what is ‘abnormal’.The WHO regards depression as a distinctive condition that differs from ordinaryemotional responses to the everyday challenges of life; the definition in theMarch 2018 WHO fact sheet entitled Depression claims that,> “Depression is a common mental disorder.”The WHO estimates that depression affects more than 300 million people aroundthe world, which clearly represents a huge potential market for the products ofthe pharmaceutical industry. Yet the distinction made by the WHO betweenemotional responses and depression relies purely on duration and severity. Bothof these criteria are similarly subjective and unhelpful in providing a methodfor determining any clear distinctions between an ordinary emotional response tothe difficulties of life and depression; if any genuine distinctions do exist.Dr Breggin suggests that there are no such distinctions and that emotions arenormal aspects of being human. He expands on this point in Toxic Psychiatry andstates that,> “Depression and elation are among the most common human experiences.”In this context, depression should not be considered as ‘abnormal’ and as anillness or disorder that requires a patient to be medicated so that they canreturn to ‘normal’. Depression frequently follows a tragic and distressing eventin a person’s life, such as the death of a loved one, for example. It should berecognised that people are different in many ways and that these differencesinclude the way they respond to the emotional challenges of life. The theorythat a certain level of emotional response is ‘abnormal’ has no basis inscience; it is a social construct.Dr Breggin explains the origin of the idea that a certain level of emotion is tobe considered as a ‘mental health problem’ that requires treatment and statesthat,> “Psychiatry and the pharmaceutical industry have been marketing depression as> a ‘real disease’ in need of medical treatment.”Despite the absence of a genuine biochemical theory of depression and associated‘behaviours’, as well as the lack of any test to determine the existence of a‘chemical imbalance’, millions of people around the world have been regularlyprescribed drugs to treat their alleged ‘mental disorder’. This is a highlylucrative market for the pharmaceutical industry, especially in view of the WHOclaim that there is an ‘under-provision’ of treatment. In addition, the WHO factsheet claims that,> “There are effective psychological and pharmacological treatments for> depression.”Pharmacological treatments include antidepressants, the establishment definitionof which is,> “a drug that alleviates the symptoms of depression.”There is however, a large and growing body of evidence which demonstrates thatantidepressants do not genuinely alleviate the symptoms of depression. Althoughpatients may perceive that their symptoms have abated due to the drugs, DrBreggin explains that this is often a mistaken perception, and that changes inthe symptoms people experience tend to mask the existence of the disablingeffects of the drugs.It is widely acknowledged that all drugs produce ‘effects’, some of which areextremely harmful; the same applies to antidepressants. Some of the dangerouseffects of antidepressants are revealed by Dr Peter Breggin and David Cohen PhDin their book entitled Your Drug May Be Your Problem, in which they state that,> “At public hearings in 2004 the FDA presented re-evaluations of antidepressant> clinical trials for children and youth under age eighteen documenting that the> suicide risk was doubled in children taking antidepressants compared to> similar individuals taking a sugar pill.”The result of these hearings was a limited action, which was that,> “The FDA published a new required label for all antidepressants on January 26,> 2005 including a black box headlined ‘Suicidality in Children and> Adolescents’.”Whilst ‘increased suicidality’ is a more than adequate reason to be extremelyconcerned about these drugs, they are associated with many other ‘side effects’.The acknowledged ‘side effects’ of antidepressants include the followingsymptoms: anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility,aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania,and mania. These symptoms are often similar to, and in some cases the same as,the symptoms for which the drug would have been originally prescribed.Dr Russell Blaylock MD, a former neurosurgeon, discusses the use ofantidepressants in his book entitled Health and Nutrition Secrets, in which herefers to many of the ‘side effects’ of ‘psychiatric medications’ andparticularly the effects that they have produced in young people,> “It is also interesting to note that in virtually all of the school shootings,> the kids responsible for the violence were taking SSRI medications, which are> known to produce suicidal and homicidal side effects. It is also known that> these medications increase brain levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin,> which in high concentrations can also act as an excitotoxin.”There has, however, been a recent change in the approach of the medicalestablishment towards the use of SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor)medications for children and teenagers. The WHO fact sheet about depressionrefers to antidepressants and states that,> “They should not be used for treating depression in children and are not the> first line of treatment in adolescents, among whom they should be used with> extra caution.”This is clearly a better approach but it should have been implemented manydecades ago, as it would have saved countless children and young people frombeing damaged by these drugs; although the best approach would be one thatavoids drugs entirely.One drug that is still prescribed for young children is Ritalin, which is one ofthe trade names of a compound called methylphenidate that is referred to as acentral nervous system stimulant. Ritalin is described as ‘amphetamine-like’,which is the reason it was previously referred to as one of the legal drugs thatare similar to ‘illegal’ ones. Ritalin is used for ‘behavioural disorders’ suchas ‘ADD’ and ‘ADHD’, which are conditions claimed to be suffered by some youngchildren who are considered to have problems paying attention, particularly inschool. Some of the ‘side effects’ of this drug include: loss of appetite, moodswings and stomach aches. Dr Breggin comments on the effects of Ritalin in ToxicPsychiatry and states,> “It seems to have escaped Ritalin advocates that long-term use tends to create> the very same problems that Ritalin is supposed to combat – ‘attentional> disturbances’ and ‘memory problems’ as well as ‘irritability’ and> hyperactivity.”The reduction or alleviation of symptoms is perceived to be a successful outcomeof treatment, which means that any reduction in the feeling of depression willbe similarly perceived to be a successful outcome; but, as with all drugtreatments, they do not address the real causes of the strong emotions that manypeople experience.Dr Breggin summarises his own approach to depression in Toxic Psychiatry, inwhich he states that,> “Despite all of this biopsychiatric propaganda ...depression is a readily> understandable expression of human despair that is frequently responsive to> psychosocial help.”The topic of stress is discussed in detail in chapter ten.NOTE: It must be emphasised that anyone who takes psychiatric medications mustseek competent professional advice if they wish to consider or to undertake awithdrawal programme, as there are many potential effects that withdrawal fromthese drugs can produce. In his 2015 article, Dr Breggin states that,> “Withdrawing from psychiatric drugs can be emotionally and sometimes> physically dangerous. It should be done carefully with experienced> supervision.”AntihypertensivesThe establishment definition of hypertension refers to,> “high blood pressure i.e. elevation of the arterial blood pressure above the> normal range expected in a particular group.”There is a great deal of concern within the medical establishment about elevatedblood pressure, because it is said to force the heart to work harder in itsefforts to pump blood through the arteries and around the body. This extra workis said to cause excess strain on the heart and blood vessels and lead to healthproblems, especially heart disease. It is claimed that elevated blood pressureabove the range considered to be ‘normal’ is a reliable indicator of anincreased risk for the occurrence of a heart attack or a stroke.The medical establishment clearly considers high blood pressure to be synonymouswith hypertension; as also indicated by the May 2019 WHO fact sheet entitledHypertension, which states that,> “Hypertension – or elevated blood pressure – is a serious medical condition> that significantly increases the risks of heart, brain, kidney and other> diseases.”Dr Richard D Moore MD PhD, however, disagrees with this view and states in hisbook entitled The High Blood Pressure Solution that,> “There is a lot more to hypertension than just elevated blood pressure. The> increased blood pressure is a marker, or a sign that something is out of> balance.”A salient point made by Dr Moore is that a stroke can occur in the absence ofelevated blood pressure, which means that the relationship is not as direct asthe medical establishment claims it to be.The May 2017 WHO fact sheet entitled Cardiovascular diseases states that,> “Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a group of disorders of the heart and> blood vessels…”The fact sheet refers to the scale of the problem and states that,> “CVDs are the number 1 cause of death globally…”In addition, the Hypertension fact sheet states that,> “Hypertension is a major cause of premature death worldwide.”It is clear that diseases of this nature are indicative of extremely serioushealth problems; but, like all other diseases, their nature is misunderstood bythe medical establishment. CVDs are discussed in greater detail in chapterseven.The original theory about blood pressure claimed that an elevated level was theunderlying health problem; an idea that arose as the result of observations inwhich elevated blood pressure correlated with certain ill-health conditions.These observations were developed into the theory that elevated blood pressurewas a causal factor for various health problems, such as heart attacks andstrokes.The medical establishment solution for raised blood pressure, as with virtuallyall other health problems, inevitably involves the use of drugs that areintended to lower blood pressure to a ‘normal range’. The achievement of a bloodpressure reading within that normal range is perceived to be a successfuloutcome of the treatment and one that is able to reduce or even eliminate therisks of the associated health problems. The original theory about bloodpressure was, however, based on a mistaken assumption, as Dr Moore explains,> “But we now know that rather than being the primary problem, high blood> pressure is a symptom of an unhealthy imbalance in the cells and tissues> throughout the body.”Unfortunately, the ‘we’ of Dr Moore’s statement does not refer to the medicalestablishment, which continues to maintain the position that elevated bloodpressure requires medication so that it can be lowered to fall within the rangeregarded as ‘normal’; as indicated by the information provided by the WHO factsheet.The ranges of blood pressure readings considered to be ‘normal’ for each agegroup have undergone a number of revisions since they were first created; ateach revision the ‘normal’ range has been reduced. The basis for these changesis the continuing, but erroneous, assumption that elevated blood pressure is thecause of health problems and that the reduction of a person’s blood pressurereading will also reduce the risks of the health problems associated with it.The medical establishment claims that the most effective method for loweringblood pressure to the ‘normal range’, is through medication withantihypertensive drugs to be taken over the course of long periods of time; andoften become lifelong. The continual downward revisions of the ‘normal’ rangesresult in an ever-greater proportion of the population perceived to haveelevated blood pressure and therefore ‘at risk’; this results in anever-increasing number of people who are prescribed antihypertensive drugs andalso, inevitably, in vastly increased profits for the pharmaceutical industry.The most recent large study that has been undertaken to investigate the problemsassociated with high blood pressure, indicates that another revision to an evenlower ‘normal’ range is likely to occur in the near future. This study, calledSPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial), was designed to answercertain questions, as explained on the website. One of the questions was,> “Will lower blood pressure reduce the risk of heart and kidney diseases,> stroke, or age-related declines in memory and thinking?”This question indicates that the study intended to investigate other healthproblems in addition to heart disease and stroke, the two that are most oftenassociated with elevated blood pressure. The UK NHS suggests that kidney diseaseis one of a number of conditions that can cause high blood pressure.The SPRINT study involved more than 9,300 people aged 50 or older, who had ablood pressure reading that was higher than a certain designated figure and whowere regarded as having at least one ‘risk factor’. These participants weredivided into two groups, one of which received the ‘standard’blood-pressure-lowering treatment with the aim of achieving a certain targetlevel of blood pressure. The other group received ‘intensive’blood-pressure-lowering treatment with the aim of reducing their blood pressureto an even lower target level. The purpose was to determine if there were anybenefits to be gained by achieving the lower blood pressure levels.In September 2015, the NIH (National Institutes of Health), which had providedfunding for the study, prepared a Press Release stating that the study had beenended a year early because the results were felt to be sufficiently significant.The Press Release begins with the statement that,> “More intensive management of high blood pressure, below a commonly> recommended blood pressure target, significantly reduces rates of> cardiovascular disease, and lower risk of death in a group of adults 50 years> and older with high blood pressure.”This statement would tend to suggest that the study has produced good news; butthis would be a mistaken interpretation. One of the findings reported within theinitial results was that the ‘intensive treatment’ group experiencedsignificantly higher rates of serious adverse events than the ‘standardtreatment’ group. This result ought to have been expected by those people whoknow that all drugs produce ‘side effects’ and that the use of multiple drugsincreases the number of adverse health events.Dr Moore explains the nature of some of the adverse health effects that resultfrom antihypertensive drugs,> “Besides lowering blood pressure, all antihypertensive drugs can produce> undesirable side effects. This is not surprising since they alter basic body> functions not only in the blood vessels but in the nervous system and kidneys> as well.”This indicates that kidney disease can be the result of antihypertensive drugs,rather than the cause of high blood pressure, as suggested by the NHS.Drugs, by definition, are intended to interfere with the normal functions of aliving organism. The existence of effects in the blood vessels, nervous systemand kidneys indicate that antihypertensive drugs interfere systemically; theireffects are not restricted to the lowering of blood pressure. This furthercorroborates the statement in the previous section that drugs produce effects inparts of the body that are not the targeted, ‘diseased’ area.The belief that the body is comprised of separate parts, each of which can be‘fixed’ without reference to any other parts, perpetuates the idea that theadverse effects of drugs are ‘risks’ worth taking as they ‘fix’ the diseasedpart; but this is a false belief. Furthermore, patients are rarely advised ofthe full extent of the risks associated with the drugs they have beenprescribed.The failure of the medical establishment to acknowledge the toxicity ofpharmaceutical drugs continues to endanger lives on a daily basis.In his book, Dr Moore discusses the different types of drugs that are used forthe treatment of hypertension and explains their ‘action’ in the body. The firsttype of treatment that is usually offered to a patient is a diuretic, which‘works’ by stimulating the kidneys to increase their production and excretion ofurine. The purpose of this is to encourage a reduction in the level of sodium inthe body, because an increased level of sodium in the body is believed to be amajor factor that can cause hypertension.But, as Dr Moore reveals, it is not the absolute level of sodium in the bodythat is a problem; instead, the key factor is the comparative level of sodiumwith respect to the level of potassium. Cells require both sodium and potassium,but they must be in the correct balance with respect to each other for the cellsto function properly.It is not uncommon that diuretics will fail to achieve an adequate reduction inblood pressure, which leads to the recommendation of other more powerful drugsto continue the process. There are a number of drugs in this category, forexample, adrenergic inhibitors, ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers. Asindicated by their names, all of these drugs are designed to inhibit, block orotherwise interfere with the body’s normal functions; which means that adverseeffects are inevitable as Dr Moore explains,> “All these drugs have undesirable side effects because they act at several> locations and tend to upset the body’s normal balance.”Although referred to as ‘side effects’, the fact that all drugs enter thebloodstream means that they are able to, and invariably do, interferesystemically; causing a wide variety of adverse effects.A worrying consequence of the SPRINT study is that, in addition to thepossibility that it may generate a new lower ‘range’ for blood pressure readingsfor all age groups, it will generate a drive for increasing numbers of people toundergo regular blood pressure monitoring, even if they have no existingill-health problems. The idea that blood pressure increases with age and thatthis is inevitably associated with increased ‘risks’ to health, already impactsmany people over the age of 50, who are encouraged to have regular bloodpressure checks. The UK NHS recommends that people aged 40 and older should havetheir blood pressure monitored annually.The causes of elevated blood pressure are admitted to be poorly understood bythe medical establishment; the UK NHS claims that it can result from certainconditions or as the result of certain medications. The CVD fact sheet suggeststhat there are some ‘behavioural factors’ that can increase the risk ofdeveloping heart disease and states,> “The most important behavioural risk factors of heart disease and stroke are> unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use and harmful use of alcohol.”Although hypertension is usually associated with increased age, it is not acondition that is only experienced by people over a certain age, whether 50 oreven 40. It is reported that high blood pressure is becoming an increasinglycommon phenomenon in young people and even children; especially in associationwith obesity. Yet, despite the recognition that an unhealthy diet is a factorthat increases the ‘risk’ of heart disease, for which the WHO recommends thatpeople reduce their salt intake and increase their consumption of fruit andvegetables, the use of blood-pressure-lowering drugs remains a key aspect of therecommended solution.Three of the four ‘behavioural risk factors’ listed by the WHO are certainlyrelevant to health, but they by no means provide a complete explanation ofcardiovascular health problems, therefore addressing these factors alone willnot solve the problem. Furthermore, ‘health’ is a full body issue; it cannot beachieved by only addressing the functioning of an individual organ or system inthe body; even if that organ is the heart, which is vital for life itself.One of the listed ‘risk’ factors, namely physical inactivity, is not the causeof any disease and so increasing physical activity can neither prevent nor solveany condition of ill-health; this topic will be discussed further in chapterten.In the attempt to provide a solution to the problem of CVDs, the WHO fact sheetrecommends treatments that include aspirin and beta-blockers, as well as thosepreviously mentioned. Aspirin is discussed in the final section of this chapteron the topic of OTC drugs.The focus of this discussion has been on the use of ‘medicine’ to address theproblem of hypertension based on the idea that the human body is solelybiochemical in nature. But this idea is misleading as the human body is alsobioelectrical in nature; an attribute that applies particularly to the heart,which is one of the major organs that function electrically. Therefore, anyfactors that produce electrical interference can have adverse effects on thecardiovascular system and especially the heart.A 2013 article entitled Earthing (Grounding) the Human Body Reduces BloodViscosity: a Major Factor in Cardiovascular Disease explains that red bloodcells have a negative electrical charge and this maintains their separation fromeach other in the bloodstream through electrostatic repulsion. The article alsostates that if the negative charge on the red blood cells is reduced, theelectrostatic repulsion is reduced and this leads to the inability of bloodcells to remain sufficiently separated. The result of this impaired functioningis that the cells ‘clump’ together and that blood viscosity increases; thearticle explains the consequences,> “Blood viscosity and aggregation are major factors in hypertension and other> cardiovascular pathologies, including myocardial infarction.”Myocardial infarction is the medical term for a heart attack.The article clearly supports Dr Moore’s claim that hypertension is more thanjust elevated blood pressure and provides an explanation for one of the causesof the condition; unfortunately, the medical establishment is largely obliviousof the body’s bioelectrical nature and therefore ignorant of a significantcausal factor of ill-health. The bioelectrical nature of the body and the healthconsequences of electrical interference are discussed in greater detail in laterchapters.StatinsThe establishment definition of a statin refers to,> “any one of a class of drugs that inhibit the action of an enzyme involved in> the liver’s production of cholesterol.”The reason that drugs are required to inhibit the production of cholesterol isclaimed by the NIH, on the Resources web page entitled High Blood Cholesterol:What You Need to Know, to be because,> “High blood cholesterol is one of the major risk factors for heart disease.”The medical establishment theory, which claims that a high level of cholesterolis dangerous and needs to be reduced, is, however, flawed. Interestingly, theestablishment definition of cholesterol highlights one of the flaws in thistheory because it includes the statement that,> “Cholesterol and its esters are important constituents of cell membranes…”Despite the plethora of recommendations by the medical establishment that peopleshould lower their intake of cholesterol, the total level of cholesterol withinthe body is not regulated by dietary intake. The overwhelming proportion,approximately 85%, of the body’s requirement for cholesterol is produced by theliver; it is only the remaining 15% approximately that is obtained through thediet. If, for some reason, the diet provides the body with insufficientcholesterol, the liver will increase its production to compensate for thatdietary deficiency. It is clear therefore, that it is the body that regulatesthe level of this vital substance.Cholesterol is not solely an important constituent of cell membranes; it is alsoan important constituent of the brain and essential for its proper functioning;as indicated by a 2010 article entitled The Effects of Cholesterol on Learningand Memory, which states that,> “Cholesterol is ubiquitous in the central nervous system (CNS) and vital to> normal brain function including signaling, synaptic plasticity, and learning> and memory.”The recognition that cholesterol is vital for the proper functioning of many ofthe body’s vital organs directly contradicts the information promulgated by themedical establishment that cholesterol is ‘dangerous’, and that high levels inthe body pose a serious ‘risk’ to health.An April 2016 article entitled Re-evaluation of the traditional diet-hearthypothesis, published in the BMJ, explains that the original hypothesis aboutlevels of cholesterol stemmed from a study called the Minnesota CoronaryExperiment that was conducted between 1968 and 1973; but the results of thisstudy were not published. This experiment was a controlled study that, for theparticipants of one of the groups, involved the replacement of saturated fatswith vegetable oils rich in linoleic acid, a polyunsaturated fat. This dietaryintervention was shown to reduce serum levels of cholesterol and assumed to bebeneficial.The documents and data from this original study have recently been re-analysedand the results published in the BMJ. The reason that the original study was notpublished is claimed to be because the researcher did not believe the results hehad obtained. The BMJ article states that,> “In meta-analyses, these cholesterol lowering interventions showed no evidence> of benefit on mortality from coronary heart disease.”In addition to the lack of evidence that any benefits accrued from the loweringof cholesterol levels, the BMJ article reports that the evidence,> “…suggests the possibility of an increased risk of death for the intervention> group…”This is not the only study that has discovered that low cholesterol correlateswith an increased risk of mortality, not a reduced risk, as the medicalestablishment claims.It is stated that there are two types of cholesterol; LDL (low-densitylipoproteins), which is regarded as ‘bad’ and HDL (high-density lipoproteins),which is regarded as ‘good’; but these labels are completely misleading. Theidea that cholesterol can be either good or bad is based on a misunderstandingthat arose from another study that investigated the effects of cholesterol onlaboratory animals. The misunderstanding occurred because it was not recognisedat the time that the cholesterol used in the study had been oxidised; it is theoxidation of cholesterol that causes health problems. In his book entitledHealth and Nutrition Secrets, Dr Russell Blaylock explains the mistakenperception about the different types of cholesterol,> “The reason LDL cholesterol is bad is that it is much easier to oxidize than> HDL cholesterol. But oxidized HDL cholesterol is just as dangerous as oxidized> LDL cholesterol.”Oxidation of the cholesterol that constitutes cell membranes will inevitably,adversely affect the cell’s function and, likewise, oxidation of the cholesterolin the brain will affect brain function. These detrimental effects are thedirect result of the process of oxidation; a process that produces ‘freeradicals’, which are highly reactive particles that can cause damage to any partof the body with which they make contact. Oxidised cholesterol has been shown tocause damage to blood vessels; although free radicals cause damage wherever theyare produced in the body.On the basis of the flawed idea that it is a high level of cholesterol in thebody that is the problem, the pharmaceutical industry developed drugs calledstatins to inhibit the production of this vitally important substance.Inevitably, there are many dangers associated with the use of statins, which, byintention, are designed to interfere with the body’s normal production ofcholesterol. The consequences of inhibiting the enzyme in the liver to reducethe production of cholesterol are discussed by Dr Carolyn Dean in Death byModern Medicine,> “That enzyme, however, does much more in the body than just make cholesterol,> so when it is suppressed by statins there are far-ranging consequences.”Statins are proclaimed by the medical establishment to be both safe andeffective, yet, like all other drugs, they produce a number of severelydetrimental effects, some of which are explained by Dr Dean,> “Since the brain has the highest concentration of cholesterol in the body,> it’s no wonder that the constant demand for lower and lower cholesterol counts> is going to impinge on brain function. Previous studies have shown that> statins can result in polyneuropathy, which causes numbness, tingling, and> burning pain. Researchers showed that people taking statins were 4 to 14 times> more likely to develop polyneuropathy than those who did not take statins.”Statins are intended to inhibit the production of cholesterol; they are notintended to address the problem of oxidised cholesterol, which means that theyfail to address the underlying cause of the problem. There are a number offactors that can cause the oxidation of cholesterol and they include many toxicchemicals that are ubiquitous to the environment, as Dr Dean explains,> “In addition, chlorine, fluoride in water, pesticides and other environmental> pollutants can also oxidize cholesterol in the body.”The problems with these chemicals and other environmental pollutants arediscussed in more detail in chapter six. Oxidised cholesterol can also be foundin processed and ‘fast’ foods, which are also discussed in more detail inchapter six.In addition to their increased use as treatments for patients with high levelsof cholesterol, statins are increasingly prescribed as preventives on the basisof the idea that this will reduce the risk of developing a CVD. As demonstratedby the study published in the BMJ, there is no evidence that high levels ofcholesterol constitute a health problem or even increase the risk of developinghealth problems. The study in fact revealed the opposite; that low levels ofcholesterol produce adverse health consequences and that statins increase thelevel of harm to health.The harm that they have been shown to cause is demonstrated by the withdrawal ofcertain statin drugs from the market following reports about a number of severe‘side effects’, and even death in some cases. Nevertheless, many statin drugsremain on the market, including some that are known to produce many seriousadverse effects, as has been reported by many patients who have taken thesedrugs. This would seem to be another instance of the benefit being claimed tooutweigh the risk; but this is clearly not the case.One of the serious adverse effects that can result from the use of statins isreported in a December 2015 article entitled Statin Use and the Risk of KidneyDisease With Long-Term Follow-Up (8.4-Year Study) published in the AmericanJournal of Cardiology. This study acknowledges that there had been few studieson the long-term use of statins, especially with respect to the effects onkidney disease. The conclusion to the study states that,> “…statin use is associated with increased incidence of acute and chronic> kidney disease.”The reason that these serious health problems were not discovered from theoriginal clinical trials is also explained by the article that states,> “These findings are cautionary and suggest that long-term effects of statins> in real-life patients may differ from shorter term effects in selected> clinical trial populations.”Yet again, the medical establishment’s lack of knowledge about the human bodyhas created more problems than it has solved in the attempt to reduce theincidence of heart disease. Cholesterol is not responsible for heart disease,therefore attempts to reduce the body’s production of cholesterol will notreduce the risk of heart disease.Over-The-Counter (OTC) MedicinesThe establishment definition of an over-the-counter medicine refers to,> “a drug that may be purchased directly from a pharmacist without a doctor’s> prescription.”This means that people can ‘self-medicate’; which has many implications.One major anomaly that is rarely raised in discussions on the subject relates tothe idea that the use of OTC drugs is deemed acceptable to reduce the burden onthe ‘health system’, because it means that people do not need to see a‘qualified’ physician. But all professional medical associations claim thatanyone who ‘treats’ illness other than a suitably qualified physician is a‘quack’. Yet the medical establishment deems ‘ordinary’ people to besufficiently competent to treat their own aches, pains and fevers with OTC‘medicines’.The use of OTC drugs is justified on the basis that they are able to treat‘minor’ conditions, such as headaches and fevers, and that the cessation ofthese symptoms indicates that the illness has been conquered and the person isnow ‘well’. However, pain and fever can occur as the result of a number ofunderlying factors, including the use of prescription drugs, that are notaddressed by the OTC drugs, which only alleviate symptoms or sometimes stopthem, albeit temporarily.Although the drugs that are available without prescription are limited tocertain types and only available in restricted strengths and quantities, theinherent problems with pharmaceutical ingredients and manufacturing processesdemonstrate that OTC drugs are similarly toxic by nature and therefore similarlyharmful. Their potential dangers are indicated by the fact that these drugs areavailable in restricted quantities to avoid the adverse effects from the ‘wrong’dose.There is a limited recognition by the medical establishment of the potentialharm from OTC drugs, as described in an April 2013 article entitledOver-the-counter medicine abuse – a review of the literature published in theJournal of Substance Abuse. The emphasis in the article is clearly withreference to the abuse of OTC drugs, but it does include an acknowledgement ofthe potential for addiction and of the harm they can cause. A particularlyrelevant comment in the article is that,> “OTC medicine abuse is a recognised problem internationally but is currently> incompletely understood.”This statement shows yet another facet of ‘healthcare’ that is poorlyunderstood, but it also fails to address a fundamental question, which is why‘medicines’ that are supposed to ‘heal’ can cause ‘harm’; especially those ofthe restricted types that are allowed to be purchased without a prescription.In addition to any ‘effects’ caused by each individual drug is a lesser knownproblem, which is the effects that result from interactions between differentdrugs. It is a sad fact of life in the early 21st century that a large number ofpeople take multiple prescription medications as well as many OTC drugs; this isknown by the term ‘polypharmacy’.The medical establishment recognises the existence of interactions and someinformation may be printed on the package inserts of OTC drugs, which is usuallyavailable and accessible after the purchase has been made, unless the customerhas consulted the pharmacist, who may be able to provide some information aboutcontraindications.The scale of OTC drug manufacture alone is huge; the FDA web page entitled DrugApplications for Over-the-Counter (OTC) Drugs states that,> “…there are over 300,000 marketed OTC drug products…”The total number of drug products available on the market is therefore clearlyenormous. However, the full extent of the potential interactions between alldrugs, both prescription and OTC, is entirely unknown, because, although somedrug-drug interactions have been investigated, the overwhelming majority ofdrugs remain untested for their interactions with all other available drugs,both prescription and OTC.The failure to address the problem of unknown drug-drug interactions is only ina very small part due to the fact that new drugs of all kinds are constantlybeing introduced onto the market, even though some drugs are removed. The majorreason for the lack of full knowledge about the interactions between drugs isbecause, as previously mentioned, many ‘treatments’ have not been exhaustivelytested or independently assessed.The easy availability of OTC ‘medicines’ suggests that they would have beenthoroughly tested for their efficacy and safety; but this is not the case. Onthe web page about OTC drug applications, the FDA states that they only reviewthe active ingredients, not the individual drugs. But, as previously cited, theFDA only conducts reviews of reports prepared by the pharmaceutical company thatmanufactured the drug; they do not conduct their own independent tests todetermine the safety and efficacy of the active ingredients of the drugs theyapprove.This is a major problem within the medical establishment ‘system’, which isincreasingly controlled by the pharmaceutical industry, as will be discussed inchapter nine. The general public is therefore completely in the hands of thepharmaceutical industry with respect to all of the ‘medicines’ they may take.A few examples of common OTC drugs will demonstrate some of the hazardsassociated with their use.AspirinThe establishment definition of aspirin refers to,> “a widely used drug that relieves pain and also reduces inflammation and> fever.”Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) is a common OTC drug; it is an NSAID(nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug). It is also used as a ‘preventive’ forheart attacks and strokes; although for this preventive purpose it isrecommended to be taken at a ‘low dose’ and usually under the direction of aphysician. Although all ‘experts’ within the medical establishment are generallyin agreement on topics relating to appropriate treatments, the Mayo Clinic webpage entitled Daily aspirin therapy: Understand the benefits and risks makes theinteresting revelation that,> “…there’s some disagreement among experts about whether the benefits of> aspirin outweigh its potential risks.”This statement illustrates two points, one of which is the intriguing idea that‘experts’ do not always agree, thus challenging the ridiculous notion thatscience is always the result of a ‘consensus’. The other, more salient, point isthat it highlights the contradictory notion that a substance can be bothbeneficial for and pose risks to health.Some of the ‘side effects’ of aspirin include gastrointestinal problems such asnausea, vomiting and abdominal pain; more serious effects includegastrointestinal bleeding. These effects, which are not ‘side effects’ butdirectly result from the ingestion of aspirin, should not be surprising becauseaspirin is recognised to irritate the stomach lining.It was once quite common for doctors to recommend aspirin for children with afever. But it was later discovered that when children were diagnosed withconditions such as chickenpox or ‘flu’, the use of aspirin to treat the fevercould cause a condition called Reye’s syndrome, which affects the brain andliver and is often fatal.The ‘active ingredient’ in aspirin is salicylic acid, which is synthesised froma substance found in willow bark that has long been regarded as an effectivepain relief agent; it is claimed that Hippocrates used it. Previous discussionshave indicated however, that a long history of the use of any substance toalleviate symptoms does not prove that it is beneficial or safe. Some of thesubstances used as remedies ‘worked’ due to their toxic nature; an emetic is apertinent example.It is also important to emphasise that the suppression of symptoms, such as painor fever, with drugs will never ‘cure’ the problem because they do not addressor remove the underlying cause.Paracetamol/AcetaminophenThe establishment definition of paracetamol refers to,> “an analgesic drug that also reduces fever.”Paracetamol, or acetaminophen as it is also called, became a popular replacementfor aspirin when detrimental effects, such as Reye’s syndrome, were discoveredto result from its use. However, paracetamol is also associated with a number ofdetrimental effects and has been officially cited as a major cause of liverfailure. It is likely that most people who take this OTC drug for their aches,pains and fevers are completely unaware of its potential danger to their health.The definition does include a limited recognition of the potential harm thatparacetamol can cause in the statement that,> “…overdosage causes liver damage.”Paracetamol is a glutathione-exhausting drug, which is one of the reasons thatit is dangerous because glutathione is an essential element for properfunctioning of the body and glutathione depletion can result in hepatic andrenal failure, hence the statement that it is a cause of liver failure.Paracetamol can also result in death, which is why it is sometimes used in largequantities by people who have tried, and occasionally succeeded, in taking theirown lives. Whilst people believe the maxim that it is the dose that makes asubstance a poison, they will continue to assume that small doses are ‘safe’;but this is a false and dangerous assumption, because an accumulation ofparacetamol resulting from many small doses over the course of a long period oftime can be similarly dangerous.CodeineThe establishment definition of codeine refers to,> “an opioid analgesic derived from morphine but less potent as a pain killer> and sedative and less toxic.”Codeine is an example of a powerful drug that can nevertheless be purchased andused without a prescription. As the definition states, it is a member of theopiate family of drugs that includes morphine and heroin and, like them, can beaddictive. Although the definition states that dependence on codeine is‘uncommon’, there is adequate evidence to demonstrate that it has causedaddiction, a fact that is stated in the previously cited article about OTCmedicine abuse.In addition to the possibility of addiction, there are distinct symptomsassociated with withdrawal from codeine, which, if people are unaware of them,can be confused with a new kind of health ‘problem’.It has also been established that codeine is metabolised in the body intomorphine, which can be passed by a breastfeeding mother to her baby.The ‘side effects’ of codeine include symptoms that range from headaches andvomiting to hallucinations, mood changes and impotence. These are extremelyunpleasant ‘effects’ from a medicine that is supposed to relieve pain. Mostpeople will, however, be unaware that these new symptoms are the result of thecodeine they have taken and may assume it is a new health problem for which theymay seek relief from the use of other OTC medicines.AntacidsThe establishment definition of an antacid refers to,> “a drug that neutralizes the hydrochloric acid secreted in the digestive> juices of the stomach.”Antacid drugs are another very popular group of over-the-counter medications.They are used for the relief of heartburn or indigestion, which are assumed tobe the result of the production of too much acid in the stomach. The stomachnormally produces acid as part of the digestive processes and usually does so inthe correct volume to fully process the food that has been consumed. However,antacids disrupt the natural level and balance of acid in the stomach, whichtherefore needs to produce more acid to counteract the effects of the antacid inorder to process the food.The frequent use of antacids will inevitably result in digestive problems andcan lead to more serious conditions; the continual consumption of antacids willintensify digestive problems rather than relieve them.The real problem that causes the symptoms associated with indigestion is thatthe stomach contains too much food for the digestive juices to be able toprocess all of it efficiently. Antacids therefore produce the completelyopposite effect from the one they are claimed to produce.◆◆◆ The examples discussed above are clearly only a few of the drugs availablewithout prescription. There are of course many more, all of which can be viewedin the same way: in other words: they do not address the underlying causes ofthe symptoms; they do not result in the return to a state of ‘health’; and theyinvariably cause additional health problems, some of which are more serious thanthe original problem they were intended to remedy.In SummaryIt should be abundantly obvious from the discussions in this section that drugsare not only ineffective, but are also harmful. This statement, althoughchallenging to the information promulgated by the medical establishment, can becorroborated by the physicians quoted in this chapter, to which can be added thefollowing remarks.First from Dr Carolyn Dean in Death by Modern Medicine,> “Loss of confidence in drug companies is inevitable when drugs are pulled from> the market due to dangerous side effects. Numerous recent examples include> hormone replacement therapy, causing heart disease and cancer; suicides on> antidepressants, Vioxx causing heart attacks; diabetes drugs causing heart> disease; statin drugs to lower cholesterol causing heart disease, impotence,> and muscle disease; and osteoporosis drugs causing jaw bone destruction.”There are two pertinent quotes by Herbert Shelton ND DC from his book, NaturalHygiene: Man’s Pristine Way of Life, the first of which states that,> “It is necessary, if they [the public] are to be rescued from drug induced> degeneracy and death, that the truth about drugs shall be made known. It must> become common knowledge that there are no good drugs and that even their> apparent beneficial effects are illusions. The symptomatic relief afforded by> drugs is as illusory as the snakes the alcoholic sees in his boots.”The second states that,> “…so long as the medical profession and the drug industry...continue to teach> the stultifying doctrine that poisons are the proper means with which to> build, maintain and restore health, the public can have no different attitude> towards drugs than the traditional one which it now holds.”NOTE: Withdrawal from any drug should always be undertaken with appropriatesupervision from a practitioner who is aware of the potential withdrawalreactions that can occur."},{"pageContent":"> 2. Vaccinations: Ineffective and Dangerous> “An error does not become truth by reason of multiplied propagation, nor does> truth become error because nobody sees it.” Mahatma Gandhi The definition of ‘medicine’ cited in the previous chapter refers to theprevention of disease. The medical establishment claims that one of the mosteffective methods by which certain diseases can be prevented is vaccination,which the establishment definition refers to as,> “a means of producing immunity to a disease by using a vaccine, or a special> preparation of antigenic material, to stimulate the formation of appropriate> antibodies.”The presence of the appropriate antibodies is therefore deemed to be synonymouswith immunity.Vaccination is widely acclaimed as one of the finest achievements of ‘modernmedicine’; a view that is encapsulated by the WHO on the web page entitledVaccines: A global health success story that keeps us on our toes, which assertsthat,> “It’s no secret that vaccines are considered one of the greatest global health> achievements.”To this statement is added the claim that,> “Every year they avert an estimated 2 to 3 million deaths.”Nothing could be further from the truth; these claims and assertions areentirely unfounded.The quote attributed to Mahatma Gandhi that opens this chapter is particularlypertinent to vaccination, which is a practice based on theories that have neverbeen proven to be true. It is for this reason that vaccination must beunderstood as an ‘error’. It is, however, an error of such a fundamental naturethat it cannot be made into ‘truth’ no matter how fervently the medicalestablishment asserts otherwise.The idea that vaccination is an error will be viewed as highly controversial;nevertheless, there is an abundance of evidence to demonstrate that, contrary tothe claims promulgated by the medical establishment, vaccines are not one of thegreatest health achievements; they do not confer immunity to disease; they donot save lives; and, most importantly, they are neither safe nor effective.These assertions can be substantiated; but to do so requires more detaileddiscussions about the theories on which the practice of vaccination is based.As indicated by the definition, the main theory involves the concept of‘immunity’. This theory claims that exposure to an infectious disease stimulatesthe body to produce the appropriate antibodies, the presence of which is said toindicate that the body has acquired ‘natural immunity’ to that disease. There ishowever, a problem with this theory, because people can and do experiencerepeated episodes of the same infectious disease; this means that they havefailed to acquire ‘immunity’ from their first exposure to the disease. Thetheory is clearly flawed as it is not supported by empirical evidence.The practice of vaccination is based on the same assumption about immunity withthe additional claim that vaccines are more effective in stimulating the body toproduce the appropriate antibodies. However, vaccinated people also experiencerepeated episodes of the infectious diseases against which they have beenvaccinated; they too have failed to acquire ‘immunity’. Vaccinated people whofail to produce the appropriate antibodies are called ‘non-responders’.In an attempt to offer an explanation for vaccine ‘non-responders’, the WHO webpage entitled Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI), in a series of pageson the topic of Global Vaccine Safety, makes the following revealing statement,> “There is no such thing as a ‘perfect’ vaccine which protects everyone who> receives it AND is entirely safe for everyone.”This statement clearly contrasts with the generally accepted view that vaccinesare fundamentally safe and effective; if this were the case, they would be safeand effective for everyone. Nevertheless, the WHO fails to explain the reasonthat the ‘greatest global health achievement’ is unable to protect or be safefor everyone.However, the mechanism by which some people become ‘non-responders’ is unknown;an anomaly that is acknowledged in an August 2013 article entitled Whenvaccinations fail to cause response: Causes vary with vaccine and person, whichstates that the reasons that some people do not respond to vaccines,> “…have remained unidentified up to now.”This admission undermines the assurances of the medical establishment prior to2013 that vaccines stimulate the body to produce antibodies that confer immunityto disease; there are clearly a number of knowledge gaps with respect tovaccines and especially to how they ‘work’. However, despite the claim in thearticle that the reasons that some people are non-responders have now beenidentified, the explanation offered does not provide any real clarity on thesubject; the article continues,> “…there is no standard pattern to this but that the causes vary according to> vaccination and group of people…”The underlying assumption is that all human bodies are alike, which means thatpeople should all respond in exactly the same manner to vaccines. Thisassumption is clearly flawed because people do not all respond in the same wayto vaccines, but this does not mean that some vaccines are effective for somepeople.In reality, no vaccine is effective for anyone; none of them is capable ofproducing immunity and therefore providing protection from disease.The previously cited WHO statement about vaccines also revealed that they arenot ‘entirely safe for everyone’; an admission that, although significant, failsto acknowledge the true scale of the problem of ‘unsafe’ vaccines.As this chapter will demonstrate, no vaccine is safe for anyone; they are allfundamentally harmful.Some of the evidence of harm caused by vaccines is acknowledged by the medicalestablishment itself; for example, the establishment definition of vaccinationalso states that,> “Vaccination is often carried out in two or three stages, as separate doses> are less likely to cause unpleasant side effects.”The most common vaccine ‘side effects’ are recognised by physicians, whogenerally warn their patients about the possibility of a fever or of sorenessand inflammation at the site of the injection. The previous chapter demonstratedthat the term ‘side effect’ is a misnomer when used to refer to the effects ofpharmaceutical drugs; it is also a misnomer when used to refer to the effects ofvaccines. There are many ‘effects’ that are the direct result of vaccination andsome of them are far more serious than fever, soreness or inflammation.The topic of vaccine injury is discussed in more detail later in this chapter.The assertion that vaccines are not only ineffective but positively dangerous isalso substantiated by Herbert Shelton who, with reference to the smallpoxvaccine, states in Natural Hygiene: Man’s Pristine Way of Life that,> “In addition to being a failure as a preventive, the vaccine produces a whole> train of evil side effects and iatrogenic diseases.”The discussion about iatrogenesis in the previous chapter indicated that theterm is used to refer to illness and death from pharmaceutical drugs and medicalprocedures. The Death by Medicine report also referred to in that discussiondoes not include vaccines as a source of iatrogenic illness and death; whichindicates that the real tragedy of iatrogenesis is far worse than has beenreported.The adverse effects of vaccines are seriously underreported for a number ofreasons, one of which is that revelations of their truly harmful nature wouldundermine the WHO claim that vaccines are a great health achievement that saveslives; a procedure that causes harm to health cannot be one that simultaneouslysave lives. Another reason is that, in order to eradicate ‘deadly infectiousdiseases’, it is claimed that a high percentage of the population needs to bevaccinated; this is referred to as ‘herd immunity’, the erroneous nature ofwhich is discussed later in this chapter. This high level of ‘vaccine coverage’will however, be jeopardised by widespread public awareness of the harmfulnature of vaccines, because it is highly likely that large numbers of peoplewill refuse to submit themselves and their families to vaccination.It is asserted that a failure to achieve herd immunity within a specifiedpopulation will have a detrimental impact on efforts to eradicate deadlydiseases, but this is not the case; the only detrimental impact from the failureto reach the requisite percentage of ‘vaccine coverage’ will be on the profitsof vaccine-producing pharmaceutical companies.Although admitted to be estimated, the number of lives alleged to be saved byvaccines varies widely according to the source of the estimate. In markedcontrast to the statistics provided by the WHO are those provided by UNICEF(United Nations Children’s Emergency Fund) in a 1996 article entitled Vaccinesbring 7 diseases under control, which makes the bold statement that,> “Two hundred years after the discovery of vaccine by the English physician> Edward Jenner, immunization can be credited with saving approximately 9> million lives a year worldwide.”The discrepancy between the claims of the WHO and those of UNICEF is significantbut unexplained; nevertheless, neither of these claims can be substantiated.It is possible, however, to substantiate the assertion that vaccines areineffective and harmful; the supportive evidence for this statement has beengleaned from the work of many eminently qualified medical practitioners, some ofwhom raised valid objections to vaccination from its inception. These people andtheir work are usually referred to in derisory terms by the medicalestablishment, but that does not deny the veracity of their reasons for opposingthe practice of vaccination; the statements they have made in opposition tovaccination were the result of their own independent investigations.England was the country in which the practice of vaccination was firstintroduced, courtesy of Edward Jenner; it was also the first country tointroduce mandatory vaccination. It is for these reasons, plus the substantialdocumentation and statistical information available on the topic, that thesituation in England provides much of the material for this discussion.One of the many medical practitioners who raised objections to vaccination wasDr Walter Hadwen MD MRCS LRCP, who had qualified in England under both the RoyalCollege of Surgeons and the Royal College of Physicians. In 1896 Dr Hadwenaddressed a meeting, at which he stated,> “As a medical man I look upon vaccination as an insult to common sense, as> superstitious in its origin, unscientific in theory and practice, and useless> and dangerous in its character.”The 1853 and subsequent Vaccination Acts made infant vaccination compulsory inEngland, although at the time only the smallpox vaccine was mandatory. DrHadwen’s objection to vaccination was so strong that he refused to allow his ownchildren to be vaccinated, despite this refusal earning him a total of nineprosecutions.Dr Charles Creighton MD, another qualified English physician, was so highlyregarded by the medical establishment that in 1884 he was asked to write thevaccination entry for the ninth edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. At thetime he was fully supportive of vaccination; but, before writing the requiredtext, he decided to investigate the subject thoroughly. The result of hisinvestigation is explained by Eleanor McBean PhD ND in her book, The PoisonedNeedle,> “He agreed to do so, but instead of contenting himself with the usual stock> statements he went right back to Jenner’s own writings and to contemporary> documents. He searched the pro- and anti-vaccination literature of many> countries and came to the conclusion that vaccination is a ‘grotesque> superstition’.”Dr Creighton’s vaccination entry, although accepted by the editor of theEncyclopaedia, was considered totally unacceptable to those in positions ofauthority within the medical establishment, because it contradicted theprevailing view on the topic. Despite the high esteem in which he was held bymost of his medical colleagues, Dr Creighton received no further requests tocontribute to Encyclopaedia Britannica.Another English physician who opposed the practice of vaccination was Dr MBeddow Bayly MD MRCS LRCP, who had also qualified under both the Royal Collegeof Surgeons and the Royal College of Physicians. In 1936 Dr Beddow Bayly wrote abooklet entitled The Case Against Vaccination, in which he states that,> “Of scientific basis or justification for the practice there is none, and the> history of vaccination is the record of a superstitious rite pursued by a> series of methods each in turn abandoned when experience proved its danger,> and presenting a trail of extravagant claims not one of which has stood the> test of time.”Clearly by 1936 the scientific basis of and justification for the practice ofvaccination were still conspicuous by their absence; a situation that remainsunchanged at the beginning of the 21st century.It may be suggested that the criticisms cited in this discussion are out ofdate, but this would be an insufficient argument. It is inappropriate, as wellas illogical, to refute the words of qualified physicians who refer tovaccination as unscientific, unjustified and a superstition purely on the basisthat they lived during an earlier period of time. The main reason that this isan entirely inappropriate argument is because the theory underlying the practiceof vaccination is far older; it is based on ideas that date back to much earlierperiods of history, long before the 18th century work of Edward Jenner, all ofwhich substantially predate the writings of the vaccination critics cited above.It may also be suggested that 21st century vaccinations are different, that thepractice now operates from the basis of ‘evidence-based science’; however, asshown by the work of Drs Hadwen, Creighton and Beddow Bayly, objectiveinvestigations into the history of the practice have revealed that there is noscience or evidence on which this practice was originally based; nor has any new‘scientific theory’ been developed since that of Edward Jenner. There is stillno scientific basis or justification for the practice of vaccination.The subject of vaccination is also discussed within the ‘alternative health’community, many of whom argue for ‘safer’, fewer or more widely-spacedvaccinations and for the vaccine schedules to be limited to only those that arenecessary. The discussions in this chapter will demonstrate that this view isalso mistaken; there are no safe vaccines and no necessary vaccines.Some HistoryThe belief that people can become ‘immune’ to a disease after an exposure tothat disease dates back many centuries. For example, the Greek historianThucydides, who was a contemporary of Hippocrates, is reported to have claimedthat people who survived the plague of Athens were not later re-infected by thesame disease.This early belief developed into the idea that a mild form of any diseaseprovides ‘protection’ against a more serious ‘attack’ of the same disease; italso inspired the creation of different methods to induce the ‘mild’ form of thedisease; one of these methods was the practice of ‘inoculation’, or variolationas it was also called.Although credited as the originator of ‘vaccination’, Edward Jenner is not to becredited as the originator of inoculation, which was practised in various placesaround the world many centuries before he was born. Some sources credit theChinese as the originators of the practice of variolation during the 10thcentury.Inoculation, the precursor of vaccination, was introduced into England in theearly 18th century, which was a period when illness was often interpreted byreference to local traditions or superstitions and invariably ‘treated’ with awide variety of crude methods and toxic substances as discussed in the previouschapter.The practice of inoculation involved taking some ‘matter’, in other words ‘pus’,from the pustules or sores of a person suffering from the disease andintroducing that ‘matter’ into the bloodstream of a healthy person via a numberof deliberately made cuts on their arms or legs. However, prior to inoculation,patients had to undergo other procedures, such as ‘dieting, purging andbleeding’, that were administered by physicians. At that period of time,inoculation was exclusively a custom of the middle and upper classes, as theywere the only people who could afford the services of a physician.The following extract is from the 1885 book entitled The Story of a GreatDelusion by William White; it provides a revealing description of the state of‘medicine’ in the early 18th century in England when inoculation was firstintroduced.> “Those who fancy there could be any wide or effective resistance to> inoculation in 1721 misapprehend the conditions of the time. There was no> scientific knowledge of the laws of health; diseases were generally regarded> as mysterious dispensations of Providence over which the sufferers had little> control; and a great part of medicine was a combination of absurdity with> nastiness. It would not be difficult to compile a series of recipes from the> pharmacopoeia of that day which would alternately excite amusement, surprise,> and disgust, and to describe medical practice from which it is marvellous that> ever patient escaped alive; but so much must pass without saying. Suffice it> to assert, that to inoculation there was little material for opposition,> rational or irrational; and that what we might think the natural horror of> transfusing the filth of smallpox into the blood of health, was neutralised by> the currency of a multitude of popular remedies which seemed to owe their> fascination to their outrageous and loathsome characteristics.”The practice of inoculation also appeared in America in the early 18th century,courtesy of Cotton Mather. It is reported that he learned of the practice fromhis Sudanese slave.The English medical establishment of the 18th century was generally supportiveof inoculation, despite the complete absence of any ‘scientific evidence’ forits efficacy or safety. Dr Beddow Bayly explains in his booklet, The CaseAgainst Vaccination, that inoculations frequently caused the disease they weresupposed to prevent. He also discusses the introduction in 1721 of inoculation,which,> “…being acclaimed by the Royal College of Physicians as ‘highly salutary to> the human race’, was assiduously carried out until 1840, when, on account of> the disastrous spread of smallpox which resulted, it was made a penal> offence.”The Royal College of Physicians was considered a prestigious organisation, butthose who were responsible for their policies had clearly failed to undertake agenuine scientific investigation of the practice of inoculation. As Dr BeddowBayly explains, inoculation was discontinued in England in 1840; it was however,fully replaced by vaccination. But vaccination was based on exactly the sameunproven theory, which is that the introduction of noxious matter into thebloodstream of an otherwise healthy person would provide ‘protection’ fromsmallpox.The influence of Paracelsus and his belief that ‘poisons’ can create health isclearly discernible.The only difference between inoculation and vaccination is that the formerintroduced ‘matter’ taken from the pustules of a person suffering with smallpoxand the latter introduced ‘matter’ taken from the pustules of a cow sufferingwith cowpox.The origin of the word vaccinate is from the Latin for cow.The practice of vaccination originated from the work of Edward Jenner, who, inthe late 18th century, discovered a belief amongst dairymaids that an attack of‘cowpox’, which is an ulceration of the cow’s udder and believed to betransmissible to humans, was said to provide a certain degree of relief from‘smallpox’. It was also believed that cowpox and smallpox were related diseases,which explains the belief that any attack of smallpox that occurred subsequentto an attack of cowpox would only be very mild.It is reported that Edward Jenner accepted the dairymaids’ belief about cowpox,but there is a further twist to this tale because at one time he held adifferent view, which is explained by William White in The Story of a GreatDelusion,> “Cows in Gloucestershire were milked by men as well as by women; and men would> sometimes milk cows with hands foul from dressing the heels of horses> afflicted with what was called grease. With this grease they infected the> cows, and the pox which followed was pronounced by Jenner to have all the> virtue against smallpox which the dairymaids claimed for cowpox.”William White further states that Jenner published a paper on his horse-greasetheory, but as it was not well-received, he returned to his cowpox theory.Whilst this may seem to be merely a minor detail, it is relevant to a fullappreciation of Edward Jenner’s true contribution to humanity; the introductionof methods of poisoning the bloodstream in the name of ‘protection’ fromdisease.Dr John W Hodge MD, an American physician, also began his medical career as asupporter of vaccination. However, he later conducted his own investigation intothe subject and this led him to became aware that vaccinations did not preventdisease, but instead, were harmful. His investigation inspired him to write abooklet entitled The Vaccination Superstition, in which he lists his objectionsto the smallpox vaccination. These objections include the following,> “After a careful consideration of the history of vaccination and smallpox ....> I am firmly convinced:> That vaccination is not only useless but positively injurious;> That there is no evidence worthy of the name on record to prove that> vaccination either prevents or mitigates smallpox.”In his role as the originator of the practice of vaccination, Edward Jenner isregarded by the medical establishment as a ‘hero’; but he is a false hero andhis accolades are undeserved. Although referred to as a physician, it isdocumented that he did not study for or pass the medical examinations that wouldhave been necessary for him to qualify as a physician. It is also documentedthat Edward Jenner purchased his medical degree, although this was not anentirely uncommon practice of the time in which he lived. These are facts,however, that are invariably omitted from the mainstream histories of his life,as they would certainly tarnish his reputation.Furthermore, his qualification as a fellow of the Royal Society was not theresult of any work that related to medical matters, but the result of his studyon the life of the cuckoo. The only paper about vaccination that he submitted tothe Royal Society was rejected on the basis that it lacked proof. Other thanthis rejected paper no further ‘scientific’ work was submitted by Edward Jennerto the Royal Society for approval on the topic of vaccination, as HerbertShelton explains,> “Neither Jenner nor any of his successors ever re-presented the claims for> this vaccine, together with proofs, to the Royal Society…”During the 19th century there was a great deal of opposition in England to thepractice of vaccination and this led to the creation in 1866 of ananti-vaccination movement, particularly after the enactment of the compulsoryVaccination Acts. The movement gained momentum after further and more stringentcompulsory Vaccination Acts had been passed and larger numbers of people becameaware of the dangers of vaccines. This movement would eventually include anumber of eminent physicians of the time; two of whom are cited by Dr Hadwen inThe Case Against Vaccination,> “…Dr Crookshank and Dr Creighton...have knocked the bottom out of this> grotesque superstition and shown that vaccination has no scientific leg to> stand on…”At the time Dr Edgar Crookshank MD was professor of pathology and bacteriologyat Kings College. He, like Dr Creighton, was originally supportive ofvaccination but, after conducting his own independent investigation into thesubject, he too changed his professional opinion. He is recorded to have statedthat the medical profession should give up vaccination.In 1896 the movement was re-named ‘The National Anti-Vaccination League of GreatBritain’. Its members included some of the qualified physicians whose work isquoted in this chapter, in addition to the two eminent physicians referred toabove, who supported the movement once they had investigated the matter forthemselves and discovered the complete absence of any scientific evidence forits use. Other notable supporters of the British anti-vaccination movement werethe scientists Alfred Russel Wallace and Herbert Spencer and the author GeorgeBernard Shaw.The attitude of the medical establishment towards the ‘anti-vaccinationmovement’ in the 19th century was extremely derogatory, despite the eminentphysicians and scientists who were supportive of their efforts. This disparagingattitude has continued and remains firmly in place in the early 21st century. Itis illustrated by an article in the February 2008 Bulletin of the WHO entitledVaccination greatly reduces disease, disability, death and inequity worldwidethat provides a suggestion of how to address people who question vaccines,> “The best way in the long term is to refute wrong allegations at the earliest> opportunity by providing scientifically valid data.”The genuine ‘scientifically valid data’ to be used to refute the wrongallegations with respect to the efficacy and safety of vaccines, can bedemonstrated by the scientific investigations conducted by physicians such asDrs Creighton, Crookshank, Hodge and Hadwen, to name just a few, all of whomconcluded that vaccines have no basis in science, nor are they safe oreffective. The ‘wrong allegations’ are therefore those that claim otherwise.Inoculation and vaccination were both introduced on the basis of the samebeliefs and superstitions, not on the basis of science, and they both generatedan increased incidence of and mortality from the disease known as smallpox.Unfortunately, however, although inoculation was abolished, the ‘grotesquesuperstition’ that is vaccination has yet to be subjected to the same fate.SmallpoxThe establishment definition of smallpox refers to it as,> “an acute infectious disease causing high fever and a rash that scars the> skin.”Smallpox is the only human disease that the medical establishment claims to havesuccessfully eradicated; this is said to have occurred as the result of avaccination campaign during the 1960s and 1970s.‘Pox’, in whichever form, refers to a disease that is characterised by skinsores, pustules and fever. The occurrence of diseases like smallpox results froma combination of factors that include poor living conditions, as described by DrHadwen in his previously cited 1896 address, in which he states that,> “It was a time when, to take London for instance...Sanitary arrangements were> altogether absent. They obtained their water from conduits and wells in the> neighbourhood, Water closets there were none, and no drainage system existed.> It was in London especially that smallpox abounded…”Unfortunately, the statistics relating to the incidence of smallpox in Londonwere extrapolated to the rest of the country under the assumption that theincidence was the same everywhere. This was a mistaken assumption becausesmallpox was far more rampant in overcrowded towns and cities with no sanitaryarrangements than in rural areas, which made the problem of smallpox seem farworse than it was. The greatest problem was that the mistaken ideas aboutdisease causation promulgated by the medical establishment and taught in medicalschools, prevented most physicians from recognising that the dreadful conditionsin which many people lived were directly related to their poor health.These dreadful living conditions also existed in a number of European countriesin the early 18th century; they were not restricted to England, nor weremistaken ideas about disease causation restricted to that country either. Asindicated in the previous chapter, erroneous notions of health and disease haveexisted in various countries around the world for millennia.It is quite clear from books and documents written during the 19th century thata number of physicians were aware that poor living conditions, which included alack of sanitation and drainage, as well as a lack of fresh water and personalcleanliness, were important factors in the causation of smallpox. There isirrefutable evidence to support this assertion; such evidence includes twoexamples of courses of action implemented that were both successful in achievingsubstantial reductions in the incidence of and mortality from smallpox. In bothexamples, the actions taken included the abolition of existing vaccinationprogrammes, as well as the implementation of sanitary reforms.The first example refers to the situation in Cleveland, Ohio as explained by DrJohn Hodge, who wrote in 1902 that,> “To Dr Friedrich, in charge of the Health Board of Cleveland, Ohio, is due the> credit of furnishing the civilized world with an example of a large city being> absolutely free from smallpox, and it would be well to note that one of the> first means that he adopted in producing this result was to abolish> vaccination absolutely.”The second example refers to the English town of Leicester, which is explainedby Lily Loat, secretary of the National Anti-Vaccination League of GreatBritain, in her 1951 book entitled The Truth About Vaccinations andImmunization,> “The town of Leicester rejected vaccination in favour of sanitation. Her> experience during the past fifty years makes nonsense of the claims of the> pro-vaccinists. When her population was thoroughly vaccinated she suffered> severely from smallpox. As vaccination declined to one percent of the infants> born, smallpox disappeared altogether.”The scientific method requires scientists to follow the evidence. The empiricalevidence, obtained from the experiences of the people of Cleveland andLeicester, shows unequivocally that vaccination cannot be credited as the meansby which these towns both became virtually free from smallpox.These examples expose the obvious anomaly in the medical establishment claimthat vaccination was responsible for the eradication of smallpox; in both cases,it was the eradication of vaccination that successfully reduced the incidence ofthe disease. These examples also serve to add substantially to the weight ofevidence that vaccination was a major contributory factor to the eruption ofsmallpox; not to its eradication.It may be suggested that the 19th century smallpox vaccine was not as efficientas the 20th century vaccine that was used to eradicate the disease. But thiswould be a mistaken idea, because the 19th century vaccine is claimed to havebeen ‘successful’, even though it is obvious that it was not. Additionally, the20th century vaccine is admitted to have dangerous side effects; a fact that isrevealed by the WHO web page entitled Frequently asked questions and answers onsmallpox. One of the questions asks why the vaccine is no longer used, the WHOresponse is that,> “No government gives or recommends the vaccine routinely since it can cause> serious complications and even death.”This comment poses a significant challenge to the basic theories underlying thepractice of vaccination, and ought to raise the question of how a dangerousvaccine could be considered safe or able to ‘protect’ against disease. It oughtto also raise serious doubts about the ability of this dangerous vaccine to havebeen the means by which smallpox was eradicated; the examples of Cleveland andLeicester demonstrate conclusively that no vaccine achieved this feat.The degree of harm caused by the smallpox vaccine is revealed by the statisticsabout the incidence of the disease after vaccination had ceased to becompulsory; as indicated by Dr Walter Hadwen, who states in a 1923 article forthe magazine Truth that,> “The Compulsory Vaccination Act was passed in 1853; a still more stringent one> followed in 1867. And between the years 1871 and 1880 there were 57,016> smallpox deaths. Compare this with the small number in the present day, when> considerably more than half the population is unvaccinated, when awful> warnings are periodically uttered about the decimating scourge always ‘bound> to come’, which never arrives! Between 1911 and 1920 the deaths numbered only> 110.”The medical establishment continues to issue warnings about many impending‘scourges’ that fail to arrive. One of the reasons for such fear-mongering isthe opportunity it provides for the pharmaceutical industry to develop vaccines,on the basis of the claim that they confer immunity to disease; a claim that hasnever been substantiated.Vaccines have, however, been undeniably proven to cause harm; the dangers of thesmallpox vaccination are further illustrated by Herbert Shelton, whose wordsecho the findings of Dr Hadwen,> “After about 40 years of compulsory vaccination, Britain suffered the worst> smallpox epidemic in its entire history, with the highest death rate in> history.”During this period of time, physicians still employed a variety of toxicsubstances in the treatment of disease, as described by William White in hisreference to the 18th century ‘pharmacopoeia’ cited in the previous section.These ‘treatments’ provide further evidence of the lack of a true understandingof health and disease that existed at the time; a lack of understanding thatpersists into the early 21st century.A typical ‘pharmacopoeia’ of the 18th and 19th centuries, and even of the early20th century, included dangerous substances such as mercury, arsenic andantimony. These highly toxic substances, which were prescribed by physicians as‘medicine’, would have contributed to their patients’ health problems andexacerbated existing conditions.Dr Gerhard Buchwald MD elaborates on this point in his book entitledVaccination: A Business Based in Fear, in which he states that,> “Many of the terrible smallpox epidemics of past centuries were in fact not> the result of a mysterious activation of virulent pathogens, but often the> direct result of medical measures. It was not until these attempts by the> medical profession were prohibited by official decree of the affected cities> or countries that epidemics of smallpox declined and disappeared.”Another description of some of the conditions that contributed to the incidenceof smallpox is provided by Dr Hadwen, who stated in his previously cited 1923article that,> “…one fact stands out pre-eminently in every part of the world where smallpox> has appeared – namely, it has been invariably associated with insanitary and> unhygienic conditions...It has followed in the wake of filth, poverty, wars,> pestilence, famines and general insanitation, in all ages.”These dreadful conditions have not been eradicated; many of them still exist invarious parts of the world that continue to be ravaged by all kinds of diseases.Vaccines cannot eradicate diseases caused by these conditions; only eradicationof these conditions can result in the eradication of the illness, suffering anddeath that they cause.PolioPolio is the abbreviation of the term poliomyelitis, the establishmentdefinition of which describes it as,> “an infectious virus disease affecting the central nervous system.”The first clinical description of polio was provided in 1789, although thecondition was not named ‘polio’ until 1874. The original description refers to‘debility of the lower extremities’, which demonstrates that paralysis wasregarded as an essential feature of the condition. Prior to being named ‘polio’,conditions that involved debility of the limbs were referred to by differentnames, such as palsy or apoplexy, as well as paralysis. Palsy is a term that hasalso been used to refer to the debility or paralysis that can result from astroke.The 21st century description of ‘polio’, by contrast, claims that paralysisoccurs in less than one per cent of cases; a description that suggests it refersto a rather different condition than the one originally described in the 18thcentury.Paralysis is said to have been described in medical writings that date back manymillennia, including those of Hippocrates two and a half thousand years ago.Some of these ancient writings refer to cases of paralysis that had resultedfrom exposures to ‘poisonous substances’.There are more recent writings that contain references to paralysis that occursas the result of exposures to poisons. Some of these references have beencollected and documented by Dr Ralph R Scobey MD, who, in April 1952, prepared astatement for the Select Committee to Investigate the Use of Chemicals in FoodProducts in the US House of Representatives. Dr Scobey’s statement, entitled ThePoison Cause of Poliomyelitis and Obstructions To Its Investigation, refers toevidence about some of these poisons; as demonstrated by the following extracts,the first of which refers to evidence from the 18th century,> “Boerhaave, Germany, (1765) stated: ‘We frequently find persons rendered> paralytic by exposing themselves imprudently to quicksilver, dispersed into> vapors by the fire, as gilders, chemists, miners, etc., and perhaps there are> other poisons, which may produce the same disease, even externally applied’.”Quicksilver is another name for mercury.The second extract refers to evidence from the 19th century,> “In 1824, Cooke, England, stated: ‘Among the exciting causes of the partial> palsies we may reckon the poison of certain mineral substances, particularly> of quicksilver, arsenic, and lead. The fumes of these metals or the receptance> of them in solution into the stomach, have often caused paralysis’.”Dr Scobey’s statement was discovered in an investigation conducted byindependent researcher Jim West; it is available from his website.The toxic substances referred to in these extracts are those to which peoplewere mainly exposed as a result of their working environment; although toxicsubstances, especially mercury and arsenic, were also used as ‘medicines’ duringboth the 18th and 19th centuries. Many documents written in the late 19th andearly 20th centuries provide similar examples and refer to other poisonoussubstances, such as phosphorus, cyanide and carbon monoxide, that are similarlycapable of producing paralysis.Dr Scobey’s statement also includes reference to a number of investigationsconducted to study ‘outbreaks’ of polio in the early 20th century. Some of theinvestigations seemed to indicate a link between ‘outbreaks’ of polio and theconsumption of fresh fruit. It was also noticed that these outbreaks frequentlyoccurred in the autumn soon after the harvest. Whilst it has occasionally beensuggested that this finding indicated an inherent problem in the fruit itself,the real cause of the ensuing symptoms is far more likely to be toxic pesticidesapplied to the fruit crops.One crop pesticide that had been introduced and widely used early in the 20thcentury was DDT, which was widely publicised as being ‘good for you’; DDTbelongs to a group of chemical compounds known as organochlorines, which arediscussed in more detail in chapter six.It was eventually discovered that DDT was far from ‘good for you’; it was infact highly toxic. The dangerous nature of DDT and other pesticides washighlighted by Rachel Carson in her famous 1962 book entitled Silent Spring. Herbook documents the dangers of the widespread, indiscriminate and irresponsibleuse of vast quantities of toxic chemicals, particularly organochlorines, andtheir disastrous effects on the environment. DDT was finally banned in the US in1972 and in some other countries at a similar time; although unfortunately itwas not banned everywhere.DDT was largely replaced by parathion, an organophosphate, which, although lesspersistent, is not necessarily less toxic. Organophosphates will also bediscussed in more detail in chapter six, but it is important to mention at thispoint that phosphorus is used in nerve agents on the basis that it is known todisrupt processes within the nervous system; in other words, phosphorus is aproven neurotoxin. It should be noted that the definition of polio includesreference to effects on the central nervous system.The use of phosphorus-based agricultural products was not new nor were thedetrimental effects unknown, as demonstrated by another extract from Dr Scobey’spreviously cited statement, in which he states that,> “During an epidemic of poliomyelitis in Australia in 1897, Altman pointed out> that phosphorus had been widely used by farmers for fertilizing that year.> This observation may be of significance since in recent years organic> phosphorus insecticides, such as parathion, have been suspected as possible> causes of poliomyelitis.”Organophosphates are not the same compounds as the phosphorus-based fertilisersand pesticides that were used in 1897; organophosphates were not created untilthe 1940s. There is however, a clear connection between the use of certainchemicals known to be toxic, or neurotoxic to be more precise, and a diagnosisof poliomyelitis; this connection should have made it worth pursuing atoxicological investigation of cases of paralysis that had been diagnosed as‘polio’.Unfortunately, the medical establishment has ignored this connection betweenneurotoxins and paralysis and has only pursued the hypothesis that a ‘virus’ isthe causal agent of polio. The problems with ascribing the cause of any diseaseto be a ‘virus’ are fully explored and discussed in chapter three.Dr Jonas Salk MD is generally credited with the discovery of the poliovirus inthe mid-20th century. However, earlier work had been undertaken at the beginningof the 20th century by Dr Simon Flexner and his colleague Paul Lewis whorepeated the prior but unsuccessful work of Karl Landsteiner and Erwin Popper.The experiments conducted by Dr Flexner and Paul Lewis are reported to have been‘successful’ in transmitting paralysis between monkeys and are often cited asproviding the ‘proof’ that polio is infectious.In their experiments, Dr Flexner and Paul Lewis produced paralysis by creating aconcoction, which included the ground-up spinal cord from a ‘polio’ victim, thatwas injected into the brain of a living monkey. In order to prove‘transmission’, they extracted some of the fluid from the monkey’s brain andinjected that into the brain of another monkey. This series was continuedthrough a number of monkeys. The fact that each subsequent monkey becameparalysed as a result of the injections is claimed to provide the ‘proof’ of theinfectious nature of the disease.This kind of experiment does not provide ‘proof’ of the infectious nature of anydisease; this brutal and artificial method bears absolutely no relationshipwhatsoever to the ‘normal’ transmission route of an alleged infection with a‘virus’. Injecting toxins into the brain of a living animal can, and clearlydoes, produce paralysis, which is the only fact that has been ‘proved’ by thesemonkey experiments.Unfortunately, it was these experiments that became the focus of the researchinto ‘polio’, although it was only at a much later date, after a number offailed attempts, that a vaccine could be produced. Dr Salk’s polio vaccine wasfirst used in 1954. Although the vaccine was hailed as a success and Dr Salk wasawarded the Congressional Medal, the vaccine began to produce cases ofparalysis; in other words, it was causing ‘polio’, not preventing it. Even moresurprising is the fact that, in 1977, Dr Salk and a number of other scientistsadmitted that the mass vaccination programme against polio had actually been thecause of most polio cases in the US.Nevertheless, the medical establishment continues to ignore the well-documentedevidence that there are causes of polio other than a so-called ‘virus’; the mainreason for this relates to the continuing vaccination programme. The previouslycited 1996 UNICEF article, which claims that smallpox had been eradicated byvaccines, makes the hopeful comment that,> “Polio could be next.”The discussion in the previous section demonstrated that smallpox was noteradicated by vaccines and that the vaccine was proven to cause harm, includingparalysis; a fact that Herbert Shelton explains in his 1951 article entitled,Serums and Polio,> “Smallpox vaccinations often result in paralysis of one side of the body.”In the same article, he also refers to a number of other vaccinations that havebeen shown to be associated with cases of paralysis and states that,> “It has long been known that inoculations of all kinds frequently cause> nervous diseases, including paralysis.”He further explains that some of these cases were reported in prestigiousmedical journals and, as an example, he refers to study papers that werepublished by The Lancet in 1950; these papers reveal that,> “…infantile paralysis had followed inoculations with diphtheria toxoid,> whooping cough vaccine and the combined diphtheria vaccine and whooping cough> vaccine.”There is evidence that many ‘adverse events’ have followed the combineddiphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough) and tetanus vaccine (DTP); these ‘adverseevents’ include paralysis and death. The trivalent DTP vaccine has been largelyreplaced by pentavalent or hexavalent vaccines; these too are often accompaniedby adverse health events, including paralysis and death.In her book The Truth about Vaccination and Immunization, Lily Loat also refersto the adverse effects that vaccines can cause and states that,> “From the year 1922 cases of inflammation of the brain and spinal cord> following and apparently due to vaccination came to light. The technical name> for this was post-vaccinal encephalitis or encephalomyelitis.”She further reports that there was a great effort to exonerate vaccination asthe cause of these cases of inflammation of the brain, and in part the effortsucceeded. However, some physicians remained unconvinced and continued to assertthat these adverse effects were caused by vaccines.Despite the failure of the vaccine to be effective, the medical establishmentnevertheless claims that polio is close to being eradicated due to thevaccination programme; as indicated by a 2016 CDC web page entitled Updates onCDC’s Polio Eradication Efforts that states,> “Polio incidence has dropped more than 99 percent since the launch of global> polio eradication efforts in 1988.”This claim is highly questionable, because there is an increasing incidence ofinfant paralysis in a number of countries around the world. One country in whichthis problem is rife is India, where cases of paralysis are increasingsubstantially, despite the claim that the country is virtually ‘polio-free’. Thesituation is explained by a January 2013 article entitled Polio free does notmean paralysis free on the website of The Hindu; the title is self-explanatory.One of the likely contributory factors for these cases of paralysis in India isDDT, which was never banned in that country as it had been in many othercountries around the world. In fact, the use of DDT is being increased in Indiaon the basis that it is required to assist efforts to eradicate malaria; theproblem of malaria is discussed in detail in chapter eight. Another contributoryfactor to an increased incidence of infant paralysis in India is theever-expanding infant vaccination schedule.The medical establishment claims to explain the increasing incidence ofparalysis by reference to a new condition, which is ascribed the label AcuteFlaccid Paralysis (AFP). These cases of paralysis do not however represent a newcondition, especially as AFP is described as ‘clinically indistinguishable frompolio’.The claim that only one per cent of polio cases involve paralysis serves tosupport the notion that AFP must be a ‘new’ condition; but this is disingenuous,as the Indian media frequently reports ‘sharp increases’ in the incidence of AFPfollowing administration of the OPV (oral polio vaccination). It should be notedthat the ‘side effects’ listed on the package insert of one brand of OPV vaccineinclude ‘post-vaccination paralysis’. Although the OPV vaccine is ingested bybabies rather than injected into their bodies, it clearly contains substancesthat are able to cause paralysis.It would seem, therefore, that the ‘new’ condition referred to as AFP is, inreality, purely a name change used for cases that would previously have beendiagnosed as ‘polio’. The main reasons that the medical establishment wouldcreate a new name for polio would be to support their claims that the incidenceof this disease is decreasing; that polio will be eradicated in the near future;and that vaccination is the means by which this alleged success will have beenachieved.It is clear from the foregoing discussion that vaccines are incapable oferadicating paralysis; they are, however, eminently capable of causingparalysis.Cervical CancerCervical cancer is claimed to be caused by a ‘virus’ called HPV (Humanpapillomavirus) and to be preventable by vaccination.The establishment definition of HPV states that there are more than 50 strainsof this virus and that some of them are considered to be causative factors incertain cancers, especially cervical cancer, but adds the ambiguous commentthat,> “…additional factors are necessary before the cells become malignant.”HPV was not the first virus to be considered as the causal agent of cervicalcancer; that dubious honour goes to a virus called herpes simplex, butepidemiological studies were unable to find a sufficient level of correlation toimplicate the herpes virus and so the research continued until HPV wasdiscovered.The January 2019 WHO fact sheet entitled Human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervicalcancer states that there are more than 100 strains of HPV and that,> “…most HPV infections clear up on their own and most pre-cancerous lesions> resolve spontaneously…”Nevertheless, despite the relatively harmless nature of most strains of HPV, thefact sheet claims that about 14 strains are cancer-causing. Yet the WHO fails toexplain the reason that a few strains of this otherwise harmless virus can causeone of the most deadly of human diseases; this is highly anomalous.The theory that cervical cancer is caused by a virus inevitably led to thedevelopment of vaccines that would prevent HPV infections. There are currently 3vaccines in use, all of which are said to protect against the two HPV strains,namely 16 and 18, that are claimed to be responsible for approximately 70% ofcervical cancer cases and pre-cancerous lesions. The fact sheet also claimsthat,> “Clinical trial results and post-marketing surveillance have shown that HPV> vaccines are very safe and very effective in preventing infections with HPV…”In addition, the fact sheet makes the statement that,> “HPV is mainly transmitted through sexual contact and most people are infected> with HPV shortly after the onset of sexual activity.”It is for this reason that HPV vaccination is recommended for children prior totheir teenage years; as indicated by the CDC web page entitled HPV Vaccine forPreteens and Teens, which states that,> “Getting vaccinated on time protects preteens long before ever being exposed> to the virus.”Despite the WHO claim that these HPV vaccines are all ‘very safe’, the CDC webpage acknowledges that they can cause ‘side effects’, the most common of whichinclude pain, dizziness, nausea and fainting. Nevertheless, the CDC assertsthat,> “The benefits of HPV vaccination far outweigh any potential risk of side> effects.”Unfortunately, nothing could be further from the truth; HPV vaccines confer nobenefits; they are unsafe and ineffective.One of the main reasons that these vaccines are ineffective is because theunderlying theory that any virus can be the cause of any form of cancer isfundamentally flawed; furthermore, cancer has a completely different mechanismof action from that of a virus. The mechanism of cancer involves anuncontrollable multiplication of abnormal cells that do not die, whereas themechanism of a viral infection is claimed to involve the death of cells; theflawed nature of this claim is discussed in chapter three. The differencesbetween the mechanisms of cancer and infection were identified by ProfessorPeter Duesberg PhD, who states in his book entitled Inventing the AIDS Virusthat,> “As with virtually all cancers, the dynamics of cervical cancer development> simply do not match the behaviour of viruses.”In addition to the existence of different mechanisms is the absence of anyevidence of a causal association between HPV and cancer. In an August 2012interview on the Natural News website, Dr Russell Blaylock MD was asked aboutthe claim that HPV causes cervical cancer to which he replied that,> “There’s no absolute evidence of a causation.”The absence of evidence that HPV causes cervical cancer poses a seriouschallenge to the claim that vaccines are effective measures for preventing thedisease; a point that Dr Blaylock makes in his further comment that,> “They don’t even have scientific evidence of any kind to back up the assertion> that this vaccine prevents cervical cancer.”Furthermore, according to the UK NHS, the protection claimed to be conferred byHPV vaccines only lasts for approximately 10 years; yet cervical cancer isreported to mainly affect women between the ages of 30 and 45, which, for girlsvaccinated in their preteen years would be long after the effectiveness of thevaccine had expired. This clearly presents a severe deficiency in the alleged‘protection’ conferred by the vaccines; but, as Dr Blaylock states, there is noevidence that they confer any protection.There is, however, an abundance of evidence that demonstrates these vaccinescannot be described as ‘very safe’; they have been shown to be extremelydangerous. In 2008, Judicial Watch (JW), an American organisation, prepared areport based on documents obtained from the FDA as a result of FOIA (Freedom ofInformation Act) requests. The report, entitled Examining the FDA’s HPV VaccineRecords, is available on the JW website; with reference to Gardasil, one of the3 vaccines in current use, the report explains that,> “The controversial vaccine was fast-tracked for approval by the FDA despite> concerns about Gardasil’s safety and long-term effects. The vaccine is still> in the testing stages ...but it is already being administered to thousands of> young girls and women.”The report states that there had been over 8,000 cases of adverse health effectsand at least 18 deaths following administration of the vaccine within a periodof only 2 years after its approval. A March 2013 article entitled JWInvestigates HPV Compensation Program, also on the website, states that,> “Judicial Watch announced today that it has received documents from the> Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) revealing that its National> Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) has awarded $5,877,710 to 49> victims in claims made against the highly controversial HPV (human> papillomavirus) vaccines.”The investigation by Judicial Watch is not the only source of criticism of theHPV vaccination. Dr Gary Null PhD, on his radio show at Progressive RadioNetwork, reported a conversation in 2010 with Cindy Bevington, who has alsoinvestigated Gardasil, which includes her comment that,> “Besides the 66 deaths, Gardasil’s serious side effects now include Guillain> Barré syndrome, lupus, seizures, anaphylactic shock, chronic fatigue,> paralysis, blood clots, brain inflammation, blurred vision and blindness,> convulsions, demyelinating encephalomyelitis, multiple sclerosis, pancreatitis> and various digestive disorders.”These ‘side effects’ are considerably worse than those reported by the CDC.Although the fear of cancer understandably remains strong in people’s minds,these effects are far too serious to be considered risks worth taking;especially as there is no evidence that the vaccine confers any protection froman infection with HPV, or that the virus causes cancer.The most serious and tragic ‘side effect’ that has occurred after theadministration of the vaccine is the loss of life. Sadly, there have been manysuch tragedies since 2006; the number of deaths has continued to increase sincethe 66 that were reported in 2010. Statistics reported in May 2016 of adverseeffects following the Gardasil vaccination reveal that the number of seriousadverse events had reached a total of 4,954 and that the number of deaths hadreached a staggering total of 245.There is very little that could be considered more tragic than the death of achild or young person, especially when it has been the result of a vaccinationthat was supposed to protect them from a disease. The most heartbreaking aspectis that no vaccine can prevent cancer because cancer is not caused by a virus;these young lives have been lost for no good reason.No words can adequately describe such a tragedy!Initially, the HPV vaccine was only administered to young girls for theprevention of cervical cancer; however, according to the WHO fact sheet,> “…the vaccination prevents genital cancers in males as well as females…”This has resulted in the expansion of the HPV vaccine programme in somecountries to include all boys in their preteen years.In Dr Null’s interview with Cindy Bevington, previously referred to, the lattermade a further important comment, in which she said that,> “Professional journal articles and studies have shown documented cases of> babies testing positive for HPV as well as nuns who have never had sex, as> well as adolescent boys who happen to have it under their fingernails.”It is claimed that millions of people are exposed to HPV during their lives,which thoroughly refutes the idea that this is a dangerous virus that is mainlytransmitted through sexual contact.Unfortunately, children and adolescents will continue to suffer whilst themedical establishment retains the unsubstantiated belief that cancer can becaused by a sexually-transmitted virus and that ‘protection’ can be conferred bya vaccine. The fear-mongering promotion of these beliefs prevents people fromdemanding the evidence for any of these claims; were they to do so, it wouldsoon be discovered that no genuine scientific evidence exists.◆◆◆ It is neither practical nor necessary to discuss all of the infectious diseasesagainst which vaccines are claimed to provide protection. All vaccinations arebased on the same underlying theory, which proposes that ‘germs’ are the causalfactors; however, as will be discussed in chapter three, this is a fundamentallyflawed theory.There is no evidence to demonstrate that any vaccine is either safe oreffective; there is, however, ample evidence to demonstrate that they are allpositively dangerous, the reason for which is due to the nature of theiringredients.Vaccine IngredientsIt is a sad fact of life in the 21st century that the medical establishment hasencouraged the belief that the only harmful ingredients of vaccines are the‘pathogens’ that cause the disease the vaccine is claimed to prevent.However, nothing could be further from the truth; vaccines are harmful becauseof their toxic chemical ingredients, not because of the so-called ‘pathogens’.It is highly probable that the vast majority of people are as entirely unawareof the chemicals used to manufacture vaccines as they are of the chemicals usedto manufacture ‘medicines’; nevertheless, the ingredients of both medicines andvaccines include a variety of toxic chemical compounds.Vaccine ingredients fall into three different groups. The first group consistsof the alleged ‘pathogens’; the second consists of chemicals called adjuvants;the third group consists of the chemicals used as preservatives and fixatives.The function of an adjuvant is to boost the body’s immune response; this ‘boost’is said to enhance the production of antibodies and generate a greater level ofprotection against the disease. The substances used as adjuvants includealuminium hydroxide and aluminium phosphate. Aluminium is a known neurotoxin.The purpose of preservatives is to prevent the vaccine from being contaminatedwith microbes. The substances used as vaccine preservatives include thiomersal(thimerosal), which is a mercury-based compound. Mercury is also a knownneurotoxin.The use of mercury in vaccines has become a highly contentious issue,particularly in connection with autism, which is discussed in detail in chapterseven. The controversy has, however, resulted in the elimination of mercury frommost vaccines administered to babies and small children, although it is admittedthat mercury is still used in certain vaccines, mainly flu vaccines that arepackaged in multi-dose vials.There is, however, evidence that mercury remains a constituent of most, if notall, vaccines, including those that are claimed to be mercury-free. One sourceof this evidence is an email exchange with the FDA and CDC conducted by aconcerned parent who contacted these organisations with questions about themercury content of vaccines. This correspondence, which is published on the Ageof Autism website, includes a response from the CDC which states that,> “None of the other vaccines used today in the United States to protect infants> and toddlers against infectious diseases contain Thimerosal as a preservative.> Thimerosal still may be used in the early stages of making certain vaccines.> However, it is removed through a purification process. When this process is> complete, only trace, or insignificant, amounts of Thimerosal are left (less> than 0.3 mcg) and these amounts have no biological effect.”The claim that ‘trace amounts’ of mercury in vaccines are insignificant and haveno biological effect clearly relies on the notion that it is the dose that makesa substance a poison. This claim is, however, disingenuous; as indicated by aSeptember 2010 article entitled Mercury Exposure and Children’s Health whichstates that,> “Mercury is a highly toxic element; there is no known safe level of exposure.”The vast amount of publicity that has surrounded the controversy relating to theuse of mercury in vaccines, has unfortunately neglected adequate discussionabout other vaccine ingredients that are also toxic; these include formaldehyde,aluminium, ammonium sulphate, sorbitol, aspartame, monosodium glutamate andphenol.Formaldehyde is known to be neurotoxic; it has also been recognised by the IARC(International Agency for Research on Cancer) as carcinogenic. Despite itsacknowledged toxicity, formaldehyde is said to be endogenous, in other words,the medical establishment claims that the human body produces formaldehyde‘naturally’; a claim that is used to justify its inclusion as a vaccineingredient. Its use is also justified on the basis that the amount offormaldehyde in vaccines is substantially less than the amount purported to bemade by the body; as the FDA page entitled Common Ingredients in U.S. LicensedVaccines states,> “The amount of formaldehyde present in some vaccines is so small compared to> the concentration that occurs naturally in the body that it does not pose a> safety concern.”This too is an example of the reliance on the Paracelsus fallacy; but again, itis a misplaced reliance. The purpose of using formaldehyde in vaccines is saidto be to inactivate the virus or to detoxify the bacterial toxin; thediscussions in chapter three will demonstrate the erroneous nature of theseclaims. However, it should be clear that formaldehyde must be inherently toxicin order to ‘inactivate’ pathogens.Formaldehyde is, in fact, recognised by the scientific community to be highlyreactive; the ingestion of as little as 30 ml is reported by the ATSDR (Agencyfor Toxic Substances and Disease Registry) to be capable of killing a full-grownadult. The claim that the body ‘naturally’ produces formaldehyde would thereforeseem to be highly anomalous. The contradictory nature of the claim thatformaldehyde is produced endogenously but is toxic to the human body is raisedin a 2015 article entitled Endogenous Formaldehyde is a Hematopoietic Stem CellGenotoxin and Metabolic Carcinogen, which accepts that formaldehyde can causedamage within the body, but states that this damage is,> “…counteracted in mammals by a conserved protection mechanism.”The existence of an innate mechanism that protects the body against formaldehydepoisoning indicates that the body does not regard formaldehyde as eitherbeneficial or useful; its presence in the body is far more likely to be theresult of the metabolic processing of certain substances; this topic isdiscussed in more detail in chapter six.Aluminium is another vaccine ingredient; as stated above, it is used as anadjuvant to ‘boost’ the body’s response to the vaccine. Dr Russell Blaylockstates in Health and Nutrition Secrets that aluminium is a significant braintoxin that is associated with a number of neurodegenerative diseases. Yet theWHO states on the web page entitled Aluminium Adjuvants that,> “The FDA analysis indicates that the body burden of aluminium following> injections of aluminium-containing vaccines never exceeds safe US regulatory> thresholds based on orally ingested aluminium even for low birth-weight> infants.”This statement is incredibly disingenuous; a comparison between orally ingestedlevels and injected levels of aluminium is wholly inappropriate; they are not atall comparable. Dr Blaylock explains the absorption level of ingested aluminium,> “Normally, absorption of aluminium from the gastrointestinal tract is rather> low (0.1 percent) and excretion from the body is rather rapid following> absorption.”The absorption of aluminium when injected intramuscularly is however, entirelydifferent. A June 2016 article entitled How Aluminum in Vaccines Affects YourHealth on the website of The Vaccine Reaction, which is part of the NVIC(National Vaccine Information Center), compares ingested and injected aluminiumand states that,> “When aluminium is injected into muscle, your body absorbs 100%...”The consequences of the total absorption of aluminium when injected areextremely significant, especially for the brain, as Dr Blaylock has indicated.Phenol, another common vaccine ingredient, is also known as carbolic acid; ittoo is recognised to be toxic, especially when taken internally.Aspartame and MSG (monosodium glutamate) are also toxic, despite claims to thecontrary, as will be discussed in chapter six.Other vaccine ingredients include many that are of animal origin, these include:gelatine, chick embryo, human diploid cells from aborted foetal tissue, vesiclefluid from calf skins, chick embryonic fluid, mouse serum proteins and monkeykidney cells. The dangers posed by the use of animal-derived substances invaccines are explained by Herbert Shelton,> “Vaccines and serums, now so freely employed, are of animal origin and are> well known to be sources of severe damages, such as are subsumed under the> rubric anaphylaxis.”In addition, all vaccines contain some form of protein, the adverse effects ofinjected proteins are also explained by Herbert Shelton,> “Protein, as essential to life as it is, is a virulent poison if introduced> directly into the blood without first undergoing digestion.”Although vaccines are injected intramuscularly rather than directly into thebloodstream, the toxic ingredients they contain will almost certainly reach thebloodstream, which will inevitably become poisoned. Unfortunately, the medicalestablishment promulgates the view that ‘blood poisoning’, despite its name, iscaused by ‘germs’ rather than poisons; an erroneous view, as discussed in moredetail in the next chapter. But the toxic ingredients of vaccines are eminentlycapable of poisoning the blood and causing anaphylaxis, or even death, asHerbert Shelton also explains,> “Speedy death, sometimes following vaccination and inoculation, is dignified> by the title, anaphylactic shock.”It is clear that many of the ingredients of vaccines are poisons that should notbe injected into the human body; it is therefore unsurprising that many peopleexperience adverse reactions to vaccines. Although some people may notexperience an obvious reaction to a vaccine, that does not mean that they remainunaffected by the toxic ingredients.Unfortunately, the most vulnerable members of society are those who aresubjected to increasing numbers of vaccines as the recommended infantvaccination schedules continue to expand in all countries around the world. Theconsequence of this is that the incidence and severity of adverse vaccinereactions also continues to increase and an ever-increasing number of babies andsmall children become victims of vaccine damage.Vaccine DamageDr Gerhard Buchwald MD provides a definition of vaccine damage in Vaccination: ABusiness Based in Fear that states,> “Vaccine damage is damage to someone’s health...beyond the usual extent of a> reaction to a vaccine.”All so-called vaccine ‘reactions’ or ‘side effects’ are, in reality, directeffects; reactions such as pain and inflammation at the injection site cannot beattributed to any other cause.Fevers are also recognised as vaccine ‘reactions’, although they can also beattributable to other causes. The medical establishment views a ‘fever’ in ababy or young child as a matter of concern; this is indicated by therecommendation on the UK NHS website that children with an existing fever shouldnot be vaccinated until they have recovered. For a baby or child that develops afever after vaccination the NHS offers the following advice on the web pageentitled Vaccine side effects,> “You can also give them a dose of infant paracetamol or ibuprofen liquid…”The problems associated with such ‘medicines’ have been discussed in theprevious chapter; but the symptoms experienced as the direct result of vaccinesare, like all symptoms of illness, entirely misunderstood by the medicalestablishment.A fever is one of the symptoms produced by the body in the effort to process andeliminate toxins, about which Herbert Shelton states,> “A fever is the consequence of accumulated impurities in the system…”This means that a post-vaccine fever is a direct consequence of the use of toxicingredients in the manufacture of vaccines. The logical conclusion is thereforethat other symptoms, most notably vomiting and diarrhoea, are also indicative ofthe body’s efforts to process and eliminate toxins. Chapter ten discusses thesymptoms of illness in more detail, but it should be noted in the context of thecurrent discussion that the suppression of any symptom following a vaccinationis wholly inappropriate.Although Dr Buchwald distinguishes between the ‘usual extent’ of a reaction to avaccine and vaccine damage, this distinction may be somewhat misleading, becauseit suggests that mild reactions are acceptable ‘risks’ for the ‘benefits’conferred by the vaccine.All reactions, including mild ones such as fever, soreness and inflammation, area form of vaccine injury, even if they resolve after a short period of time;they all indicate that the body has reacted to a ‘toxic assault’.Some people may appear not to react to vaccines at all; a situation that maytend to lead to an assumption that the vaccine has caused no harm; but thiswould be a mistaken assumption. The ability to process and eliminate toxinsvaries; which partly explains why people experience different responses tovaccines. However, the inherently toxic nature of vaccine ingredients indicatesthat they always cause harm, sometimes of a very serious nature, as HerbertShelton states,> “The serums and vaccines that are supposed to confer immunity often cause> troubles that are worse than the disease they are supposed to immunize one> against.”Although all reactions to vaccines are a form of ‘vaccine injury’, it is themore serious and longer-lasting effects of vaccines, referred to as ‘vaccinedamage’, that require further discussion.Vaccine damage is not a new phenomenon; adverse health effects resulting fromvaccination is as old as the practice of vaccination itself; this has beendemonstrated by the statistics of increased suffering and death that followedthe introduction of the mandatory smallpox vaccination in England during the19th century. Reported statistics about adverse health effects that result frommedical practices are however notoriously understated, especially when theyrefer to adverse effects that result from vaccines; the reason for this ismainly due to the extreme reluctance of the medical establishment to attributethe cause of illness and death to vaccination; this situation is explained byLily Loat in her 1951 book,> “Perusal of reports of some hundreds of inquests right down to the present> reveals the reluctance of coroners and investigating doctors to attribute> death to the results of vaccination.”Physicians are taught that illness or death subsequent to vaccination cannot becaused by the vaccine; they are similarly taught that illness or death cannotresult from the use of any pharmaceutical drug. The training doctors undergoinculcates a strong belief in the Hippocratic Oath that they should ‘do noharm’, which makes doctors understandably reluctant to attribute harm to any ofthe procedures they have used for their patients. This reluctance isacknowledged by Professor George Dick who states in an article in the June 1971edition of the British Medical Journal that,> “…few doctors like to attribute a death or complication to a procedure which> they have recommended and in which they believe.”Although understandable, this reluctance should not blind doctors to theincreasing volume of empirical evidence that vaccines do cause harm. Many bravephysicians, as discussed in previous sections of this chapter, have overcomemany of the fallacies of their medical training and recognised the failingswithin the theories about vaccination.Despite accumulating evidence to the contrary, medical training programmespreserve the dogma that vaccinations are effective and a safe method ofpreventing disease; with the proviso that some people ‘may’ react badly to them.There are reasons that some people react more strongly to vaccines than others,but those reasons are not understood by the medical establishment that deniesthe relevance of toxic vaccine ingredients as contributory factors.The denial that vaccines cause harm, except in allegedly ‘rare’ circumstances,is illustrated by the NHS Vaccine side effects page that states,> “Not all illnesses that occur following vaccination will be a side effect.> Because millions of people every year are vaccinated, it’s inevitable that> some will go on to develop a coincidental infection or illness shortly> afterwards.”The claim that an ensuing illness is ‘coincidental’ is unscientific; illnessfollowing vaccination is rarely a ‘coincidence’ and is invariably a directeffect of the vaccine. The idea that a subsequent illness can be an ‘infection’is also erroneous, as the discussions in the next chapter will demonstrate.Although some effects occur within a short period after the administration of avaccine, some effects take longer to become noticeable, as Dr Buchwald explains,> “Vaccine damage is generally not recognised immediately after vaccination, but> in many cases only after weeks, months or – in certain circumstances – also> years later.”Eleanor McBean wrote The Poisoned Needle in 1957, which was a time when thestandard infant vaccination schedule contained far fewer vaccines than in theearly 21st century. However, she reports that many medical doctors werebeginning to observe an increase in the incidence of cancer and other serioushealth problems as the vaccination coverage in the population increased. Many ofthese physicians were fully convinced that vaccines were substantialcontributing factors to these diseases. One of the physicians referred to in herbook is Dr Forbes Laurie MD, who had been Medical Director of the MetropolitanCancer Hospital (London); Eleanor McBean quotes his statement that,> “I am thoroughly convinced that the increase in cancer is due to vaccination.”The claim that there is a connection between vaccination and cancer may beperceived as yet another outrageous statement but that does not make it untrueor even impossible. As the detailed discussion about cancer in chapter sevenwill show, one of the main factors that contribute to its development is theaccumulation of toxins, especially those that are carcinogenic. It should benoted that mercury and formaldehyde are both recognised carcinogens.The above statement should not be interpreted to mean that vaccination is thesole cause of cancer; nevertheless, vaccines are likely to be major contributoryfactors, even though this is rarely acknowledged. The fact that the vastmajority of the population has been subjected to vaccination means that it isvirtually impossible to perform comparison studies between vaccinated andunvaccinated populations, that may be able to indicate if the incidence ofcancer in the former group exceeds that of the latter group. There are reasonsthat epidemiological studies are unable to establish the existence of a clearlink between vaccines and cancer and these are discussed in chapters six andseven. However, the use of carcinogenic substances as ingredients of vaccinesindicates that a causal link cannot be dismissed.When the practice of vaccination was originally introduced, Edward Jennerclaimed, without any evidence to support his claim, that a single vaccinationagainst smallpox would be protective for life. However, the increased incidenceof smallpox that occurred, despite the increased numbers of people who had beenvaccinated, indicated that ‘protection’ was clearly not life-long. Instead ofrecognising that vaccines did not work as believed, the medical establishmentinstituted the practice of re-vaccination throughout people’s lives to ensurecontinuing ‘protection’; a practice that completely contradicts the basic theorythat vaccines confer immunity to disease.The idea that people needed to be regularly revaccinated is also a completecontradiction of the claim by the NHS that the early vaccines were ‘crude’ but‘worked’. They certainly were crude, but it is abundantly obvious that they didnot ‘work’.The 20th century smallpox vaccine that is claimed to have been successfulagainst the disease was similarly crude but also ineffective. In her book, LilyLoat provides information from the July 1947 edition of the British MedicalJournal that published a question referring to the recommended frequency ofre-vaccination in areas where smallpox was endemic. She reports the reply tohave been that,> “Re-vaccination every ten to twelve months should be carried out in areas> where smallpox is endemic.”This advice was published approximately 20 years before the introduction of theworldwide smallpox vaccination campaign that is claimed to have eradicated thedisease.It has been a continuing practice of the medical establishment to suppress thefailure of vaccines; one of the methods used to achieve this has been thereclassification of illness subsequent to vaccination. This has led to a rangeof new disease names; for example, the creation of AFP to replace ‘polio’.As previously mentioned, the author George Bernard Shaw was a member of theAnti-Vaccination League of Great Britain; he was also a member of a Londonhealth committee and attended their meetings. As a result of this work, heencountered the technique of re-naming post-vaccine illnesses and wrote abouthis experiences; some of his writings on the topic are quoted by Eleanor McBeanin The Poisoned Needle including his statement that,> “…I learned how the credit of vaccination is kept up statistically by> diagnosing all the re-vaccinated cases (of smallpox) as pustular eczema,> varioloid or what not – except smallpox.”Although no longer called ‘re-vaccination’, it is still claimed that certainvaccines need to be repeated at various stages of people’s lives because the‘protection’ conferred is not life-long; these are referred to as ‘boostershots’. It should be obvious, however, that if the theory that vaccines conferimmunity were correct, re-vaccination or booster shots would never be necessary.The establishment definition of vaccination claims that vaccines areadministered in separate doses in order to minimise ‘unpleasant side effects’;however, it is increasingly common for infants to receive combination vaccines,also referred to as multivalent vaccines, such as the trivalent vaccines for MMR(measles, mumps and rubella) and DTP (diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis).However, as more vaccines have been added to the standard infant vaccinationschedules, they have been increasingly aggregated; pentavalent and hexavalentvaccines have become commonplace. The medical establishment view of combinationvaccines has clearly changed since the 2007 definition that referred to the useof ‘separate shots’ to prevent ‘unpleasant side effects’. The current view,according to the CDC web page entitled Multiple Vaccines and the Immune System,is that,> “Scientific data show that getting several vaccines at the same time does not> cause any chronic health problems.”Empirical evidence from the real world, however, proves otherwise.Furthermore, many of the multiple vaccines are administered in multiple stages;for example, in the UK the ‘5-in-1’ vaccine is administered at 8, 12 and 16weeks of age. A schedule of this nature is not unique; it is typical of mostinfant vaccination schedules that are applied in most countries around theworld, in accordance with the WHO policy recommendations.These multiple vaccines introduce a substantial volume of toxic materials intothe tiny and vulnerable bodies of very young babies; inevitably there will beconsequences, none of which will be beneficial and all of which will bedetrimental to health. Some of these consequences involve effects that canprevent children from leading a ‘normal’ life and can include debilitatingimpairments that affect a child’s cognitive skills, which is indicative of harmcaused to the brain; a situation that has resulted in a number of conditionsthat are labelled as ‘behavioural problems’.Dr Buchwald refers in his book to behavioural symptoms that he calls‘unrecognisable vaccine damage’, which he describes as follows,> “These behavioural disturbances are marked by unmotivated aggression,> hyperactivity, uncontrolled behaviour, lack of concentration and lessened or> lacking inhibition threshold.”Yet, as shown by the CDC statement cited above, the medical establishment deniesthat vaccines cause ‘chronic health problems’, and therefore refuses toacknowledge that injecting neurotoxic materials into babies will havedetrimental effects on their still developing brains. These conditions, whichmay be diagnosed with labels such as ADD, ADHD or autism, are invariably theresult of a number of factors, but vaccines need to be recognised as majorcontributing factors.For a variety of reasons, it is impossible to prove a direct causal relationshipbetween a specific effect and a specific vaccine, but the fact that many‘effects’ occur subsequent to the administration of a vaccine indicates that, atthe very least, the vaccine was the ‘trigger’ for the reaction and subsequenthealth problems. The tragedy is that behavioural disturbances that can betriggered by vaccines are frequently treated with toxic psychiatric drugs; but,as discussed, these drugs will only exacerbate the problem.The reluctance of the medical establishment to properly acknowledge vaccinedamage is demonstrated by an article in the May 2011 Bulletin of the WHOentitled, No-fault compensation following adverse events attributed tovaccination: a review of international programmes. The title of the article isnoteworthy by the description of the compensation as ‘no-fault’ and by theadverse events being ‘attributed’ to vaccines rather than caused by them. Thearticle begins with the claim that,> “The public health benefits of vaccination are clear.”Although unwilling to openly admit that vaccines cause harm, the articlenevertheless acknowledges that,> “…vaccines are not without risks and it is commonly accepted that adverse> events occur following vaccination.”The general view held by the medical establishment is that treatments must beassessed according to the perceived ‘risks’ and ‘benefits’; with respect tovaccination, it is believed that the risks of adverse events are worth takingfor the alleged benefits they confer. The reason for this view is summarised inthe article that states,> “At a population level, it is considered that these small risks are balanced> by the benefits of widespread population immunization.”This view is based on the concept of ‘herd immunity’, which claims that thespread of an infectious disease can be contained, provided that a certainpercentage of the population is vaccinated and has therefore been made ‘immune’to the disease. The fallacy of this concept is exposed by the statistics, whichshowed that the compulsory smallpox vaccination programme in England resulted ina substantially increased incidence of illness and death; despite the fact thatalmost the entire population had been vaccinated.There are clearly many problems with the concept of ‘herd immunity’, not leastof which is that vaccination has never been proven to confer immunity; the topicof immunity is discussed further in the next chapter.However, a point that deserves particular attention is that the ‘small risk’referred to in the WHO Bulletin article is not ‘small’ for the baby or childthat suffers vaccine damage; the risk for them is total. The articleacknowledges this point and states that,> “…this means that an individual occasionally bears a significant burden for> the benefit to the rest of the population.”This is a fallacy; the ‘significant burden’ suffered by any individual has noability to confer any benefit whatsoever on the rest of the population; theirsuffering has no purpose and, as discussed in the section about cervical cancer,it has been entirely unnecessary. This is the real tragedy of the unproven anderroneous concept of ‘herd immunity’.There is, however, one form of immunity that does require further discussion;this is the immunity conferred on the vaccine industry by the US NationalChildhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986. As a result of this legislation,manufacturers are not held liable for injuries caused by any vaccines that aremandated by the US government.This is an outrage!The WHO Bulletin article acknowledges that ‘adverse events’ can follow theadministration of vaccines and refers to compensation funds that have beenestablished in some countries around the world; most notably in the US.The US fund is called the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP),details of which can be found on the website of the US Department of Health andHuman Services. This website provides useful information about the programmeincluding the Vaccine Injury Table, which lists various vaccines and theirpossible adverse events. The Table shows that there are very specific timeperiods during which reactions must occur in order for compensation to beconsidered. In other words, if a particular reaction does not occur within thespecified time then it is not accepted as vaccine damage.These conditions are totally inappropriate because damage from a vaccine shouldnot be restricted in this way. Adverse effects can occur over a varying periodof time, which, as Dr Buchwald explained, can extend to weeks, months or evenyears. The denial of damage as vaccine-related because it does not occur withina specified time period indicates the disingenuous nature of this programme.Further revealing information is available from the May 2019 Data report on theUS website about the VICP; the latest statistics refer to the period to the endof 2017; the report states that,> “Since 1988, over 20,629 petitions have been filed with the VICP. Over that> 30-year time period, 17,875 petitions have been adjudicated, with 6,551 of> those determined to be compensable, while 11,324 were dismissed.”These statistics show that only a little over 36 per cent of all claims thathave been adjudicated have been successful. The total compensation paid tosuccessful applicants has, however, involved a huge sum of money,> “Total compensation paid over the life of the program is approximately $4.1> billion.”Unfortunately for the American public, the US vaccine compensation programme isfunded from taxes levied on the sale of vaccines; it is therefore Americantaxpayers who are funding the compensation paid to victims of vaccine damage. Itshould, however, be the vaccine manufacturers that are held responsible for theinjury caused by their products and made liable for the compensation due tothose who have been injured.The existence of this situation, in which vaccine manufacturers are exoneratedfrom responsibility for the adverse health effects of their products, exposesthe heart of the problem; which is that the pharmaceutical industry is not inthe business of producing healthcare products that benefit the public. Instead,it is in the business of making profits that benefit their shareholders.The words of Herbert Shelton are wholly appropriate to conclude this discussion,> “The vaccinating and inoculating program is merely a commercial one. While it> nets huge profits to the traffickers in vaccines and serums, it provides no> health for the people.”The FutureUntil the existing situation changes, the error of vaccination will continue tocause untold suffering, because the medical establishment continues topromulgate the fallacy that vaccines are safe and effective. The evidence to thecontrary is overwhelming; it is only a fraction that has been included in thisrelatively brief discussion.Unless it can be stopped, the future direction of the practice of vaccination isone of continual expansion; the agenda of the medical establishment, led by theWHO, is to ensure that everyone is vaccinated. This very real agenda has beenformulated by the United Nations and is encapsulated within its latestincarnation called the 2030 Agenda, which was adopted by all UN member states inSeptember 2015. Goal number 3 of this agenda refers to,> “…safe, effective, quality and affordable medicines and vaccines for all.”The goals of the 2030 Agenda that relate to health matters are discussed ingreater detail in chapter eight.The GVAP (Global Vaccine Action Plan) 2011-2020 Report is another documentintended to contribute to the expansion of the vaccination programme; in thisinstance, the claim is made that it is a ‘human right’ to be vaccinated. Theintroduction to this report includes the statement that,> “Immunization is, and should be recognized as, a core component of the human> right to health and an individual, community and governmental responsibility.”The human right to health should include the human right to refuse to bepoisoned on the basis of an unproven and erroneous theory.The use of the term ‘community responsibility’ is intended to refer to theconcept of ‘herd immunity’, which has been discussed. The reference to‘governmental responsibility’ indicates the potential for the introduction ofmandatory vaccination laws.The suffering and mortality that ensued after smallpox vaccination becamecompulsory in England should have provided a salutary lesson against theimplementation of mandatory vaccination programmes.The pharmaceutical industry obviously plays a major role in promulgating thebelief that vaccines are safe and effective, and they achieve this mainlythrough their substantial influence over the medical establishment; thisinfluence is discussed more fully in chapter nine.A significant proportion of the pharmaceutical industry is based in the US, andPhRMA (Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America), as the namesuggests, is the industry organisation for American pharmaceutical companies. In2013 PhRMA produced a report, which documented that almost 300 new vaccines werein development. Although the majority of these vaccines are being developed tocombat ‘infectious diseases’, others are being developed to combat a variety ofother illnesses. Disturbingly, some of the new vaccines under development areintended for the treatment of some ‘neurological disorders’, particularlyAlzheimer’s disease and MS (multiple sclerosis), and of other conditionsincluding diabetes and asthma.The discussions in chapter seven demonstrate that conditions of illness that arecategorised as noncommunicable are poorly understood by the medicalestablishment. In virtually all of the diseases discussed, the medicalestablishment admits to not knowing their causes. This means that they thereforecannot know the correct methods by which the diseases can be ‘treated’; what iscertain is that no disease can be prevented by a vaccine.The reference in the GVAP report to ‘individual responsibility’ is intended tosuggest that an individual has the right to demand a vaccine to protect them; itshould be clear from the discussions in this chapter that individuals shouldalso have the right to be fully informed about the hazardous nature of vaccinesand to be able to assert the right not to be vaccinated.The human right to health does require ‘individual responsibility’, but thisshould be interpreted as the right of an individual to take personalresponsibility for their health, and for all decisions that pertain to mattersthat will affect their own health. The concept of herd immunity is a fallacythat should not be used to coerce people into being poisoned against their will.In order to make informed decisions, people need all of the information thatrelates to the subject. It is for this reason that people need to understandthat vaccination is not based on any scientific theory; it is wholly unable toprevent or eradicate any disease. Vaccines have never been proven to be safe oreffective; on the contrary, they have been proven to be both ineffective anddangerous.There are a number of reasons that the vast majority of doctors are reluctant topublicly challenge the claim that vaccines are safe and effective, despite thegrowing body of evidence that they cause harm. These reasons are discussed inmore detail later in the book, especially in chapters seven and nine.It is imperative, in order to protect human health, that the harmful practice ofvaccination is eradicated as soon as possible."},{"pageContent":"> 3. The Germ Theory: A Deadly Fallacy> “Germs as a cause of disease is a dying fallacy.” Dr John H Tilden MD The information promulgated by the medical establishment about infectiousdiseases is based on the ‘germ theory’, the fundamental assertion of which isthat germs invade the body and cause disease. The establishment definitiondescribes a ‘germ’ as,> “any microorganism, especially one that causes disease.”Disease-causing microorganisms are referred to as pathogens; however, althoughit is widely believed that all ‘germs’ are pathogenic, this is not the case.The NIH (National Institutes of Health) is a US government agency that conductsand supports biomedical research; as one of the key members of the medicalestablishment, the NIH is, inevitably, a proponent of the ‘germ theory’. The NIHwebsite is a vast repository of information that includes more than 5 millionarchived medical journal articles; it also contains various educationalmaterials, including books and teacher’s guides. One of the online books in theCurriculum Supplement series of teacher’s guides is entitled UnderstandingEmerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases. This book, which will be referredto as the Infectious Diseases book, describes microorganisms as the agents thatcause infectious diseases, but adds the interesting comment that,> “Although microorganisms that cause disease often receive the most attention,> it is important to note that most microorganisms do not cause disease.”With reference to the microorganisms that do cause disease the book states that,> “A true pathogen is an infectious agent that causes disease in virtually any> susceptible host.”The idea that a host must be susceptible before even a ‘true’ pathogen can causedisease indicates that other factors must be involved; an idea that isinconsistent with the information about ‘infectious diseases’ promulgated to thegeneral public. It is, however, only one of the many anomalies, inconsistenciesand contradictions that are exposed by a genuine investigation of the medicalestablishment’s statements with respect to ‘pathogens’ and the ‘infectiousdiseases’ they are claimed to cause.Scientists state that the word ‘theory’ does not refer to ‘an idea’, but that ithas a much more specific meaning. The first phase of a scientific investigationinvolves the creation of a general hypothesis, which is a suggested explanationfor the subject under investigation. Experiments are then devised and conductedin order to discover more information about and gain a better understanding ofthe phenomenon under review. The results of these experiments usually lead tothe creation of a theory, which is intended to provide a more comprehensive andcompelling explanation for the phenomenon than the explanation provided by thehypothesis.References by the medical establishment to the ‘germ theory’ would thereforetend to suggest the existence of a number of established facts, which are: thatall ‘germs’ have been thoroughly investigated and identified; that their abilityto cause disease has been scientifically proven beyond doubt; and that the‘theory’ furnishes a comprehensive and compelling explanation for ‘germs’ andthe mechanisms by which they cause disease.Nothing could be further from the truth.It is a fundamental principle that the burden of proof lies with those whopropose a theory. Yet in the case of the ‘germ theory’ that ‘proof’ does notexist; there is no original scientific evidence that definitively proves thatany ‘germ’ causes any specific infectious disease.Although this statement will be regarded as highly controversial and evenoutrageous, its veracity will be demonstrated by the discussions in thischapter.There are a number of sources that provide a corroboration of the assertion thatthe ‘germ theory’ lacks any original scientific proof. One of these sources isDr M.L. Leverson MD, who, in May 1911, gave a lecture in London in which hediscussed his investigations that had led him to the conclusion that,> “The entire fabric of the germ theory of disease rests upon assumptions which> not only have not been proved, but which are incapable of proof, and many of> them can be proved to be the reverse of truth. The basic one of these unproven> assumptions, wholly due to Pasteur, is the hypothesis that all the so-called> infectious and contagious disorders are caused by germs.”Corroboration is also provided by Dr Beddow Bayly, who, in addition to exposingthe lack of any scientific basis for vaccination, also exposed the lack of anyscientific basis for the ‘germ theory’. In 1928 he wrote an article that waspublished in the journal London Medical World; in this article Dr Beddow Baylystates that,> “I am prepared to maintain with scientifically established facts, that in no> single instance has it been conclusively proved that any microorganism is the> specific cause of a disease.”It is clear that evidence to support the ‘germ theory’ remained conspicuous byits absence more than half a century after it had been proposed by Louis Pasteurin the early 1860s. The situation has not been rectified in the interveningdecades since 1928; the germ theory of disease remains unproven, withoverwhelming evidence to demonstrate that it also remains a fallacy.Another critic of the prevailing ideas about disease in the 19th century wasFlorence Nightingale. During her long nursing career, she took care of manythousands of patients; an experience that proved to her that diseases were notindividual entities with separately identifiable causes. In her 1860 bookentitled Notes on Nursing, she writes that,> “I have seen diseases begin, grow up and pass into one another.”She records that when the wards were overcrowded, the ordinary ‘fevers’ withwhich patients suffered would change and worsen to become ‘typhoid fever’ andworsen again to become ‘typhus’. These diseases are regarded as specificconditions caused by distinctly different ‘pathogens’, but Florence Nightingalereports that no new ‘infection’ occurred; that the worsening of the ‘diseases’were the natural result of the unhealthy conditions that the patients endured.Typically, these conditions included overcrowding, poor sanitation, lack offresh air and lack of hygiene, which are strikingly similar to the conditions inwhich smallpox thrived.The idea that each specific pathogen causes a distinct disease is furtherexplored in the next chapter, in which a number of different ‘infectiousdiseases’ are discussed.It was shown in the previous chapter that the practice of vaccination was notoriginally based on the idea that ‘germs’ were the causal agents of disease;instead, it was based on the claim that a mild form of ‘disease’ would provide adegree of protection against a more serious attack of ‘disease’. However, afterLouis Pasteur’s version of the germ theory gained increased popularity in thelate 19th century, the idea of ‘germs’ as the causal agents of disease became anextremely useful tool to justify the introduction of different vaccines tocombat different ‘infectious diseases’.In the early 21st century, vaccinations are still justified on the basis thatthey prevent ‘infectious diseases’; the ‘germ theory’ and the practice ofvaccination are therefore inextricably interconnected. Together they provide thefoundation for a large proportion of medical establishment practices andconsequently account for a large proportion of pharmaceutical industry profits.It is Louis Pasteur who is generally hailed as the ‘father’ of the germ theory;however, he was not the originator of the basic idea that diseases were causedby external ‘infectious agents’. Prior to the 19th century, a variety of ideashad been proposed that attempted to explain the nature of disease; many of theseideas involved the existence of disease-causing ‘entities’. The earliest theoryis reported to have been that of the Italian physician Girolamo Fracastoro, who,in 1546, proposed that disease is caused by minute entities that can transmit‘infection’. His theory included the idea that these ‘entities’ becomepathogenic through heat. But Fracastoro was unable to observe the entities whoseexistence he had proposed; microscopes with sufficient lens magnification werenot available until more than a century later.It is reported that, in 1676, Antonius van Leeuwenhoek constructed asufficiently powerful microscope to be able to view the small entities that arenow recognised as bacteria; however, he proposed no theories about theseentities or their functions, he merely observed them and wrote extensively abouthis observations in a correspondence he held with the Royal Society in London.It was almost another century later, in 1762, that Dr M Plenciz, a Viennesephysician, proposed a ‘germ theory of infectious disease’; a full centuryearlier than the theory attributed to Louis Pasteur.These historical facts have been extracted from the book Pasteur: Plagiarist,Imposter written by R B Pearson, whose source is a textbook entitled HistoricalReview of Microbiology, which was written by F Harrison, who was principalProfessor of Bacteriology at McGill University.The long-held beliefs, customs and traditions that evolved into the variousideas about diseases and their causes are also discussed by Herbert Shelton inhis July 1978 article entitled Disease is Remedial Action, in which he statesthat,> “This very old idea that disease is an entity that attacks the body and wreaks> as much havoc therein as possible has taken several forms through the ages and> is incarnated in the germ theory that holds sway today.”William White explains in The Story of a Great Delusion that many of the oldattitudes from ancient times persisted into the 18th century; although anextract from his book was quoted in the previous chapter, one part of thatextract deserves repetition,> “There was no scientific knowledge of the laws of health; diseases were> generally regarded as mysterious dispensations of Providence over which the> sufferers had little control; and a great part of medicine was a combination> of absurdity with nastiness.”The old beliefs were gradually replaced by ‘scientific theories’, although thelatter varied little from the ideas they replaced. The ‘theories’ were often nomore than variations on the basic ideas, which were: that an external entityinvades and ‘infects’ the body; that this ‘infection’ causes illness; and thatsufferers have little control over their illness. More importantly, these‘scientific theories’ did not represent a significant advance in medicalknowledge about disease or health; as Herbert Shelton states,> “A hundred years ago it was freely admitted that the nature and essence of> disease was unknown.”Unfortunately, the nature and essence of disease remains largely unknown to themedical establishment of the 21st century; the reason for this situation ismainly, but not exclusively, due to their rigid adherence to the ‘germ theory’.As demonstrated throughout this book, many medical establishment practices arebased on erroneous and unproven theories, the problems with which are manifestedby empirical evidence that demonstrates worsening rather than improving healthfor virtually the entire population of the world. Yet, despite the obviouscontradictions between the theory and the empirical evidence, the medicalestablishment exhorts the public to believe their pronouncements about diseaseepidemics caused by dangerous ‘germs’, on the basis that they are the‘authority’ on matters pertaining to health.In his book entitled Confessions of a Medical Heretic, Dr Robert Mendelsohn MDindicates that belief in the ‘authority’ of the medical establishment ismisplaced. He expands on his discussion of the problems with ‘modern medicine’by reference to similarities between beliefs, religion and ‘modern medicine’. Hedescribes the medical establishment as ‘the church of modern medicine’ andjustifies this description with the statement that,> “Modern medicine can’t survive without our faith, because modern medicine is> neither an art nor a science; it’s a religion...Just ask ‘why’ enough times> and sooner or later you’ll reach the chasm of faith.”Science is an ongoing process of enquiry and discovery; this means thatscientists should reassess theories that have been found to be flawed andgenerate more compelling explanations for the phenomena under review. Yet the‘germ theory’, which can be shown to be fundamentally flawed, has not beensubjected to any rigorous reassessment. If it had been, scientists would havediscovered that the theory is contradicted by a significant volume of empiricalevidence, which is normally regarded as paramount. The intransigence of thescientific community on this topic has turned the ‘germ theory’ into dogma, notscience.Dr Mendelsohn recommends that people ask the question ‘why’; but the problemswith the ‘germ theory’ require that people also ask the question ‘how’; werethey to do so, they would soon encounter the ‘chasm of faith’, which is likelyto manifest as the familiar phrase, ‘trust me, I’m a doctor’.Although it is firmly believed by the medical establishment that Louis Pasteur’s‘germ theory’ was scientifically proven beyond any doubt, it has been revealedthat the ‘science’ he used in his experiments was not as meticulous as has beenclaimed. In his 1995 book entitled The Private Science of Louis Pasteur,historian Dr Gerald Geison refers to his investigation of Louis Pasteur’s workthat involved a comparison of his personal notebooks with his published papers.Journalist Torsten Engelbrecht and physician Dr Claus Köhnlein MD provideextracts from Dr Geison’s book in their own book, Virus Mania; one of theextracts states that,> “During his lifetime, Pasteur permitted absolutely no one – not even his> closest co-workers – to inspect his notes.”Another extract from Dr Geison’s book quoted by the authors of Virus Maniastates that Pasteur,> “…arranged with his family that the books should also remain closed to all> even after his death.”Although ideas about his possible motive for making this request can only bespeculative, this arrangement does raise the question of why Louis Pasteur wouldnot have wanted the basis of his world-famous work to be widely known. TorstenEngelbrecht and Dr Köhnlein provide a possible motive in the extremely revealingquote from Dr Geison’s book in summary of the situation that states,> “The conclusion is unavoidable; Pasteur deliberately deceived the public,> including especially those scientists most familiar with his published work.”It is clear that Louis Pasteur, like Edward Jenner, has failed to earn the rightto be revered or to be cited as a ‘hero’ of modern medicine. The facts show thatthey both contributed a great deal towards the sum of human illness, misery andsuffering, all of which have resulted from the adoption of their theories by themedical establishment.It is unnecessary to provide full details of the history of the ‘germ theory’ inorder to be able to expose the flaws on which it has been based. One of thoseflaws arises from the basic assumption about ‘infectious diseases’ and themeaning of the word ‘infection’, the establishment definition of which refersto,> “invasion of the body by harmful organisms (pathogens)…”It is clear from this definition that an infection is considered to besynonymous with an invasion by microorganisms and subsequent disease; but thisis misleading, as the body’s endogenous microorganisms are also claimed to beable to cause disease; as indicated by the Mayo Clinic web page entitledInfectious Diseases, which states that,> “Many organisms live in and on our bodies. They’re normally harmless or even> helpful, but under certain conditions, some organisms may cause disease.”This statement is highly anomalous. Although the Mayo Clinic web page offers nofurther information about the conditions deemed necessary for otherwise harmlessmicroorganisms to become pathogenic, it is suggested that ‘germs’ constantlymutate to overpower the immune system and cause disease.Another explanation is offered by the Infectious Diseases book, which statesthat the body’s ‘normal flora’,> “… do not cause disease because their growth is kept under control by the> host’s defense mechanisms and by the presence of other microorganisms.”The book claims that endogenous and invading microorganisms compete with eachother but that, in normal circumstances, the invaders are successfullysuppressed. However, if its defence mechanisms are weak, the body may beoverwhelmed by ‘opportunistic pathogens’, which are described as,> “…potentially infectious agents that rarely cause disease in individuals with> healthy immune systems.”The medical establishment acknowledges that they possess a poor level ofunderstanding about either the mechanisms involved, or the conditions that causeendogenous organisms to be activated and become pathogenic; this is discussed inmore detail in the section about bacteria.However, reliance on the immune system to prevent an invading pathogen fromcausing disease is problematic; as discussed in the previous chapter, it isclaimed that the function of the immune system is to attack and destroypathogens. This means that a strong and fully functioning immune system would beable to destroy all invaders and that anyone with a strong immune system shouldtherefore have no ‘infectious agents’, potential or otherwise, within theirbodies; microorganisms claimed to be ‘pathogenic’ have, however, been found inthe bodies of healthy people. One explanation for this situation is that somepathogens can exist in the body in a ‘dormant’ state. But a strong immune systemshould not permit the presence of any pathogen, even in a so-called ‘dormant’state, that can subsequently be ‘activated’ when the immune system has becomeweakened.The explanations offered by the medical establishment fail to genuinely addressall of the anomalies within their explanations relating to the ‘germ theory’;this will become increasingly obvious as each type of ‘germ’ is discussed inthis chapter; the immune system is also discussed in more detail later in thischapter.Unfortunately, in their attempts to address these anomalous situations, themedical establishment creates even more complex explanations that do not provideclarification, but instead, introduce further anomalies, inconsistencies andcontradictions.The ‘germ theory’ has become deeply embedded not only within modern medicine,but also within the ‘alternative health’ community. The belief in ‘germs’ is sopervasive that virtually all physicians have accepted the ideas contained withinthe ‘germ theory’; this includes many of the physicians whose work is referencedin this book due to the valid criticisms they have raised about the mainstreammedical system.The efforts of the medical establishment to promote and emphasise the dangers ofso-called ‘infectious diseases’ is demonstrated by the WHO in the World HealthReport 2007, which includes the statement that,> “…infectious diseases are emerging at a rate that has not been seen before.”There is no explanation within the context of the ‘germ theory’ for anaccelerated rate of proliferation of germs; whether they are known germs thatcause diseases believed to have been mostly conquered, or newly discovered germsthat cause previously unknown diseases.There are, however, many reasons for the ‘germ theory’ to be perpetuated as ifit has been scientifically established and proven to be true; some of thosereasons relate to economics, politics and geopolitics, which are discussed inchapter nine.Other reasons relate to the need to justify the use of vaccines and medicines,but, as this chapter will demonstrate ‘germs’ do not cause disease; a fact thatadds further to the weight of evidence that vaccines and medicines areineffective as methods to prevent or treat any so-called ‘infectious disease’.Scientific ExperimentationScience and technology have generated many innovations that have profoundlychanged the way people live; these changes have accelerated substantially overthe past three centuries since, and largely as the result of, the IndustrialRevolution.The consequences of these changes have not always been beneficial; many havebeen positively detrimental. One of the main consequences has been the almosttotal obeisance to ‘science’ in the belief that it is the only method throughwhich ‘knowledge’ can be obtained. Dr Mendelsohn’s simile that modern medicineis like a religion can be extrapolated to apply to ‘science’, in which‘scientists’ have assumed the mantle of ‘authority’ and become a new kind ofpriesthood.This situation is highly problematic; real science is a process of discovery,but the discipline of ‘science’ has become largely authoritarian because itsteachings are: that scientific knowledge is the sole repository of ‘truth’; thatonly those who accept the ‘consensus’ view are the genuine scientists; and thatany dissenting views are to be vilified and described in terms such as‘unscientific’ and ‘pseudoscience’ or with other similarly disparaging labels.The field of knowledge that has suffered the greatest harm from this dogmaticapproach is that of ‘health’, in which dissenters are labelled as ‘quacks’. Butthe use of insults has no place in a genuine scientific debate. The greatesterror of ‘scientists’ in this field, which is often referred to as ‘medicalscience’, originates from a false perception of the human body as essentially a‘machine’ of separate parts that are fundamentally chemical in nature; meaningthat a malfunction in each part can be ‘fixed’ by altering its chemical nature.This error has been compounded by the equally erroneous idea that ‘diseases’ arethe result of an ‘attack’ on the body, mainly, but not exclusively, by ‘germs’.Furthermore, most ‘scientists’ in the field of ‘medicine’ regard the livinghuman body as if it were inert; they effectively deny that it has a role of anysignificance in the production of illness or in the restoration of health. Toadd insult to injury, the medical establishment maintains the stance that it isonly their healthcare system, which operates from the basis of these ideas, thatis capable of correctly addressing matters pertaining to health.Yet again, nothing could be further from the truth.These errors have been exposed to a certain extent by the previous two chapters,but they need to be further discussed in the context of ‘infectious diseases’and the science that continues to be conducted in the efforts to ‘discover’their causal agents.‘Science’ is fast becoming the ‘authority’ for the entirety of life in the 21stcentury. But genuine science must be flexible; it must be open to newinformation that may require a revision of the prevailing theories or even areassessment of the techniques and practices used by the scientific community.One of the main reasons for the problems within medical science and thehealthcare system it promotes, is that most of the ‘science’ is conducted withinthe confines of the laboratory; this means that laboratory experimentation isnow almost entirely equated with medical science. This is a fundamental errorand one that imposes a severe limitation on the ability of ‘science’ tounderstand living organisms.Certain aspects of ‘medical science’ involve empirical evidence that is obtainedfrom the experiences of real people in the real world; for example, adverseevents resulting from the use of ‘medicines’ or vaccines that have been approvedand released onto the market. Chapters one and two demonstrated that there is agreat deal of evidence that directly contradicts the promoted claims thatmedicines and vaccines are safe and effective.Empirical evidence is, however, largely ignored when assessing the claims of‘medical science’. It is acknowledged that some tests and experiments areconducted outside of the laboratory environment, although they usually followextensive experimentation within the laboratory. Most of these initialexperiments are conducted on human or animal tissues, cells or molecules andinvolve the use of a variety of chemical substances that are tested for theirreactions on the various tissues, cells and molecules in the hope that abeneficial effect will be observed.It is reported that a new drug takes approximately ten years to develop from theinitial experiment, in which an apparently beneficial effect has been observed,to its availability on the market. This period of ten years includes the variousclinical trials that are conducted with healthy human ‘subjects’ on whom the‘side effects’ of the drugs are tested. Many of these trials are conducted overrelatively short periods of time, often a few months, or sometimes only a fewweeks.It is generally perceived that the results from laboratory experiments have adirect relevance to human ‘health’. However, the fact that experiments conductedby ‘medical science’ are performed on tissues, cells or molecules raises afundamental question about how these experiments relate to the functioning of aliving human body, whether in health or disease.One of the few scientists to have raised questions about the laboratoryprocedures used for the examination of cells and tissues is Dr Harold HillmanPhD, who has London University degrees in medicine and in physiology and adoctorate in biochemistry and is therefore eminently qualified to comment on theproblems he has discovered. The investigations he conducted over his long careerhave resulted in his bold assertion that most preparation methods directlyaffect the cells or tissues to be examined and even change their structure.This assertion is supported by Dr Bruce Lipton PhD, who observed in hisexperiments that changes he made to the culture medium had a direct effect onthe activity and health of the cells contained in the culture. He reports hisfindings in a June 2012 article entitled The Wisdom of Your Cells, whichincludes the statement that,> “…if I changed the environmental situation, the fate of the cells would be> altered.”Dr Hillman had made a number of his articles available on his website, but thisceased to be active after his death in 2016. Although these articles remainunpublished, that does not deny their veracity; the idea that onlypeer-reviewed, published papers are valid is a mistaken one; as will bediscussed in more detail in chapter nine. In his 2013 paper entitled A SeriousIndictment of Modern Cell Biology and Neurobiology, he discusses the results ofhis investigations conducted since 1970 and refers to molecular biology as,> “The chemistry of living intact biological systems.”This highlights one of the key features of, as well as one of the main problemswith, laboratory experimentation, which is that it does not investigate ‘livingintact biological systems’.In his 2011 paper entitled Cell Biology at the Beginning of the 21st Century isin Dire Straits, Dr Hillman details the preparations required for a number oflaboratory procedures and states that,> “When a tissue is prepared for histology, histochemistry, electron microscopy,> or immunochemistry, an animal is killed; the tissue is excised; it is fixed or> frozen; it is embedded; it is sectioned; it is rehydrated; it is stained; it> is mounted; it is radiated by light, or bombarded by electron beams.”A particularly salient point is that any tissue sample that is to be examined isclearly no longer alive after it has been subjected to these preparationprocedures. Dr Hillman explains in his 2013 paper that there is a complete lackof recognition of the effects of such preparation procedures on the tissuesample to be examined and comments that,> “Biologists have shown little interest in the effects that the procedures they> use have on the structure and chemistry of the tissues they are studying.”The same can be said for the chemists who investigate chemical reactions oncells, tissues and molecules etc.In addition to the effects of the procedures on the chemistry of the tissue, theeffects on its structure must also be considered; the failure to do so is one ofDr Hillman’s main criticisms of the preparation procedures. He claims that theseprocedures generate artefacts that are then perceived to be genuine features ofthe tissue sample or cell that is under examination; he explains that,> “This has led them into the study of many artefacts and distortions of the> chemistry of living systems.”An artefact is an artificial structure not present in the living tissue.One of the main laboratory methods used to view ‘germs’, especially viruses, isthe electron microscope. Dr Hillman provides a revealing statement about theresults of the preparation procedures used for this technology,> “Electron microscopists have ignored the dictates of solid geometry and most> of the apparent structures they have detected are artefacts of their> preparation procedures.”There are profound consequences of this revelation for the ‘germ theory’ andespecially for the examination of ‘viruses’, which are discussed in the nextsection.There is a further important point to be emphasised, which is that even when a‘live’ sample is examined by procedures that do not kill it, for example, duringdark field microscopy, that sample, whether cell, molecule or other type oftissue, has been removed from its normal ‘environment’; an environment in whichit was an integral part of an intact living system.There are very few conclusions that can be drawn from experiments that takeplace under the very specific conditions of the laboratory environment andassumed to be meaningful to the health of a living human body. The internalenvironment of a human body bears no resemblance whatsoever to the artificialenvironment created by scientists for their experiments in the laboratory.Furthermore, it is inappropriate to take the results of experiments that testthe reactions of chemicals with dead tissues, cells or molecules and extrapolatethem to intact living organisms, which do not react and respond to chemicals inways that can be predicted by experiments conducted on individual pieces oftissue.The idea behind the assumption that such extrapolations are appropriate is amistake of profound proportions, and is a major flaw within the field of‘medical science’. Nevertheless, it is this idea that permits scientists tocontinue to believe that laboratory experiments conducted on ‘germs’ areappropriate in order to gain a better understanding of the processes of‘disease’.The most fundamental error is, however, the basic idea that ‘germs’ causedisease; exposure of the evidence that this is an error requires a betterunderstanding of the entities that are referred to as ‘germs’, which arediscussed in greater detail in the ensuing sections.VirusesThe establishment definition of a virus refers to it as,> “a minute particle that is capable of replication but only within living> cells.”All viruses have a basic structure described by the definition as follows,> “Each consists of a core of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) surrounded by a protein> shell.”In addition, some types of virus have a lipid ‘envelope’, which gives rise totheir classification as ‘enveloped’; viruses without this structure are called‘non enveloped’.The definition also claims that viruses are the causes of many diseases, as ifthis has been definitively proven. But this is not the case; there is nooriginal scientific evidence that definitively demonstrates that any virus isthe cause of any disease. The burden of proof for any theory lies with those whopropose it; but none of the existing documents provides ‘proof’ that supportsthe claim that ‘viruses’ are pathogens.Although Dr Leverson and Dr Beddow Bayly wrote their comments exposing the lackof scientific proof prior to the invention of the electron microscope, DrHillman’s work was subsequent to its invention; he exposed many flaws that arisefrom the use of that particular piece of technology for the study of viruses.The fundamental problem lies with the use of the term ‘virus’ and the idea thatit refers to a pathogenic microorganism.During the 19th century, scientists who believed in the ‘germ theory’ had beenable to discover a variety of bacteria that appeared to be associated with anumber of the diseases they were investigating. However, they were unable tofind a bacterial or even fungal agent associated with some of those diseases.This led them to the belief that there had to be some other ‘organism’ that wasresponsible for those other diseases. They believed that it must be an organismthat was too small to be seen through the optical microscopes of the period.It was only after the invention of the electron microscope in the 1930s thatparticles smaller than bacteria could be observed in samples taken from peoplewith certain diseases. It was these tiny particles that became known as‘viruses’ and assumed to be the causal agents of all diseases that could not beattributed to bacteria.The discovery of ‘particles’ in samples taken from people with a disease, andthe assumption that this represents a causal relationship, is akin to blamingfiremen as being the causes of fires, because they are directly associated withfire and often found at premises that are ablaze. This analogy serves tohighlight the potentially dire consequences that can result from themisinterpretation of an observed phenomenon, and from incorrect assumptionsabout an association between the different factors involved.It may be claimed that the association between viruses and human disease hasbeen experimentally observed and scientifically established; but, as will bedemonstrated, this would be an incorrect claim.The word ‘virus’ had been used for centuries in connection with diseases, andwas certainly in use long before the particles now called ‘viruses’ were firstseen or even theorised; this situation is a major source of much confusion onthe topic. It is however, incorrect to assume that the particles that are nowcalled ‘viruses’ are the same ‘entities’ to which the earlier writings referred.All the evidence indicates that the early writings used the word ‘virus’ in thecontext of its original meaning, which is from the Latin for a ‘poison’ or‘noxious substance’. Careful reading of 18th and 19th century writings,particularly those that refer to smallpox inoculation and vaccination, show thatthe use of the word ‘virus’ is clearly intended to refer to some kind of‘noxious matter’. This can be demonstrated by the practice of inoculation, whichused the ‘pus’ from sores on the skins of people with the disease calledsmallpox; this pus was often referred to by the word ‘virus’. The same word wasalso used to refer to the ‘pus’ from the sores on the udders of cows with thedisease called cowpox. The ‘pus’ from sores bears a far closer resemblance tothe original meaning of ‘virus’ as a poison or a noxious substance than to an‘infectious’ particle.The word ‘infection’ was also used in many of the writings of the 18th and 19thcenturies, but not in the context in which it is now used to refer to theinvasion of a ‘germ’. In those writings the word was used in the context ofreferring to something that contaminates or pollutes. Taking the ‘pus’ from aperson’s skin sores and ‘inoculating’ it into cuts made in the skin of a healthyperson, will certainly contaminate and pollute that person’s bloodstream; thereis no need to invoke the existence of a minute particle to explain an ensuingillness resulting from blood poisoning.The definition of a ‘germ’ refers to it as a microorganism; the definition of anorganism refers to a ‘living thing’. Interestingly the establishment definitionof a virus does not refer to it as an ‘organism’, which would tend to suggestthat a virus is not considered to be alive. There is an ongoing, lively debateon the issue of whether viruses are alive or not; but there are some basicfunctions that an ‘entity’ must exhibit in order for it to be defined as‘living’, which shows that the issue cannot be one of differing opinions; it isa matter of ascertaining the facts.Dr Lynn Margulis PhD, a renowned biologist and member of the prestigiousNational Academy of Sciences (NAS) from 1983 until her death in 2011, providesan explanation in her book entitled Symbiotic Planet, of the distinction betweenliving and non-living. She refers to viruses as non-living and explains that,> “They are not alive since outside living cells they do nothing, ever. Viruses> require the metabolism of the live cell because they lack the requisites to> generate their own. Metabolism, the incessant chemistry of self-maintenance,> is an essential feature of life. Viruses lack this.”An August 2008 Scientific American article entitled Are Viruses Alive providesan interesting insight into the changing perception of viruses,> “First seen as poisons, then as life-forms, then as biological chemicals,> viruses today are thought of as being in a gray area between living and> non-living...”Although categorising viruses as being in a ‘gray area’, the articlenevertheless asserts that they are pathogenic,> “In the late 19th century researchers realized that certain diseases,> including rabies and foot-and-mouth, were caused by particles that seemed to> behave like bacteria but were much smaller.”This assertion tends to support the idea that viruses must be alive because theyare claimed to behave like bacteria, which are living entities, as will bediscussed in the next section. The use of the word ‘realised’ is intended toconvey the impression that these diseases have been proven to be caused by thosesmaller particles; this impression is however, misleading.There is clearly a significant effort to promote the view that viruses areliving entities; the main reason for this is because this view helps to justifythe claims that viruses are ‘infectious agents’ that can be transmitted betweenpeople and cause deadly diseases. But there is a major problem with the ideathat viruses can be transmitted between people, because, as Dr Margulis states,> “…any virus outside the membrane of a live cell is inert.”Widespread public knowledge that viruses are ‘non-living’ particles that areinert outside of the host cell, would make it a great deal more difficult forthe medical establishment to justify their claims that these particles aredangerous and cause many ‘deadly’ diseases.The revelation that viruses are not living particles clearly raises twofundamental questions about their alleged functions: the first is how inertparticles are able to move and be transmitted between people; the second is howviruses are able to enter the body and ‘infect’ cells.The description of a virus as inert means that it lacks the ability to move byitself. This lack of self-propelled motion is acknowledged by the medicalestablishment that refers to viruses as ‘not motile’. Nevertheless, they attemptto explain the apparent ability of viruses to ‘move’ and be transmitted betweenpeople by the claim that they ride, or ‘hitchhike’ on various other particlesthat can travel through the environment. This ‘ride’ is said to cease when thevirus particle makes contact with a new host to ‘infect’.The problem with this explanation is that it fails to explain how a virusescapes from the host cell if it is ‘not motile’. It also fails to explain howthe ‘virus’ is able to find and ‘hitch’ itself to the appropriate particle thatis going to be ejected from the body during a sneeze or a cough.The second question requires an explanation of the method by which a virus isclaimed to be able to ‘infect’ a cell. The web page of UCMP (University ofCalifornia Museum of Paleontology) Berkeley entitled Introduction to Viruses,states that,> “When it comes into contact with a host cell, a virus can insert its genetic> material into its host…”The purported mechanism is described in a little more detail in a July 2007article entitled, Imaging Poliovirus Entry in Live Cells, the abstract of whichbegins,> “Viruses initiate infection by transferring their genetic material across a> cellular membrane and into the appropriate compartment of the cell.”This ‘insertion’ or ‘transfer’ assumes that the virus takes an active part inthese mechanisms, but the idea that a virus can be active is contradicted by DrMargulis and others who state categorically that a virus is inert outside of aliving cell. The 2007 article makes the highly revealing statement that,> “The mechanisms by which animal viruses, especially non enveloped viruses,> deliver their genomes are only poorly understood.”The article also reveals that,> “How non enveloped viruses, such as poliovirus, enter target cells is not well> understood.”These statements are not only profoundly revealing but also astounding,considering that the idea of ‘viral infection’ rests on the theory that virusesenter cells in order to cause disease. These statements clearly demonstrate howlittle is actually known about viruses and their alleged mechanism of action incausing an ‘infection’. It should be obvious that a great deal of the‘information’ about viruses promulgated by the medical establishment is based ona collection of unproven assumptions and suppositions.The lack of known facts about viruses can be demonstrated by the example of acold ‘virus’ that is claimed to be transmitted via saliva or mucous particleswhen a person sneezes or coughs. These particles are said to be inhaled byanother person, who then becomes ‘infected’ by the virus, which travels throughthe person’s body to the appropriate cells of their lung tissues. Thetransmission of any viral particle attached to saliva or mucous travellingthrough the air has never been observed; viral particles are only ever observedin a laboratory under an electron microscope. The transmission of viruses in theair is an assumption; as is their ability to travel through a human body.A further contradiction of the theory that viruses are transmitted betweenpeople can be seen from another common ‘infectious disease’, namely, influenzaor ‘the flu’. The worst outbreak of this disease is reported to have occurredduring 1918 and to have killed many tens of millions of people. The number ofpeople reported to have died as the result of this epidemic varies widely fromabout 20 million to about 100 million people, which raises many questions aboutthe veracity of these claims and about the number of genuine casualties from theflu rather than from the effects of WWI. There are also many reports that claimthe real duration of the ‘epidemic’ to have been far longer than a single year.The reason that a huge number of people died during this period is claimed to bebecause the disease was highly contagious; there are however, many problems withsuch claims; the ‘1918 Flu’ is discussed in greater detail in the next chapter.The epidemic of 1918 is usually referred to as a ‘viral’ disease, althoughinitially there were ideas that it was caused by a bacterium. Herbert Sheltondescribes some of the early experiments conducted on volunteers from the USNaval Detention camp to determine the alleged bacterial cause and to test thetransmission of the disease. In his book entitled The Hygienic System: Vol VIOrthopathy, he describes one of the experiments conducted to test thetransmission of the disease and explains that,> “Ten other men were carried to the bedside of ten new cases of influenza and> spent 45 minutes with them. Each well man had ten sick men cough in his face.”He records that the results of these experiments were that,> “None of these volunteers developed any symptoms of influenza following the> experiment.”It may be suggested that 10 is too small a number to be a statisticallysignificant sample size, but this argument would miss the salient point, whichis that each healthy man had ten sick men cough in his face and none of thembecame ill; a fact that contradicts the idea that viral particles ‘hitchhike’onto saliva or mucous that is ejected from the body during a sneeze or cough.According to the ‘germ theory’, all of the healthy men should have been‘infected’ by the viruses and become ill. The fact that they did not fall illposes a direct and serious challenge to the basic assumption that ‘flu’ isinfectious.Exceptions to any rule is an indication that the ‘rule’ is flawed and needs tobe re-examined; the empirical evidence is primary.The lack of understanding by the medical establishment about the mechanism forthe viral ‘infection’ of cells has not improved since the publication of the2007 poliovirus article previously referred to; there remain both a lack ofunderstanding about and an absence of proof of the mechanism involved. This lackof progress is indicated by an August 2015 article entitled A Non-envelopedVirus Hijacks Host Disaggregation Machinery to Translocate across theEndoplasmic Reticulum Membrane, which states that,> “How non-enveloped viruses penetrate a host membrane to enter cells and cause> disease remains an enigmatic step.”Dr Hillman identified the ‘endoplasmic reticulum’ as one of the artefacts thatare generated as the result of the preparation procedures necessary to viewviruses under an electron microscope.The website of the Encyclopedia of Life (EoL), a project that promotes themedical establishment view, contains a page about ‘viruses’ and refers to themas ‘microscopic organisms’, which demonstrates the efforts to present the casethat viruses are ‘alive’. To further promote this view, the EoL web pageprovides information about the stages in a ‘viral life cycle’, the first stageof which is claimed to be one in which a virus attaches itself to a cell; thepage states that,> “Attachment is the intermolecular binding between viral capsid proteins and> receptors on the outer membrane of the host cell.”The problem with this explanation is that Dr Hillman also identified ‘receptors’as cellular artefacts that are generated by the preparation procedures used insuch experiments.It is claimed that once a virus has penetrated the cell, it will replicate,which is said to initiate the ‘disease’ process. The EoL web page refers tonumerous mechanisms involved in this process that include cell lysis and theultimate death of the cell. The page makes the significant statement that,> “In multicellular organisms, if sufficient numbers of cells die, the whole> organism may suffer gross metabolic disruption or even mortality.”There is a huge problem with this statement, which is that many billions ofhuman cells die every day; ‘cell death’ is a normal part of the processes ofhuman life. The idea that cell death is synonymous with ‘disease’ is thereforehighly misleading; it completely contradicts known biological functions of thehuman body.The reason that cell death is perceived to be a ‘disease process’ is becausethis is what is likely to have been observed during laboratory experiments.However, there are genuine reasons for cells to die after tissue samples havebeen subjected to the various preparation procedures used in laboratoryexperimentation; as explained by Torsten Engelbrecht and Dr Köhnlein in VirusMania,> “This phenomenon is particularly virulent in bacterial and viral research (and> in the whole pharmaceutical development of medicines altogether) where> laboratory experiments on tissue samples which are tormented with a variety of> often highly reactive chemicals allow few conclusions about reality. And yet,> conclusions are constantly drawn – and then passed straight on to the> production of medications and vaccines.”This explanation exposes the fundamental error in conducting laboratory researchwithout an adequate understanding of the living organism that is the human body.It also clearly supports the conclusions drawn by Dr Hillman, that laboratoryprocedures affect the samples being investigated to the point that they bear noresemblance to ‘reality’.Yet most scientific information about viruses is derived from laboratoryexperiments of this nature. In these experiments ‘viruses’ are reported to havereplicated inside a cell, after which the cell dies. This process does not provethat the ‘virus’ killed the cell nor does it prove that the ‘virus’ initiatesany disease processes; it merely proves that the cell died after the processesused in the experiments. These points are also raised in Virus Mania, in whichthe authors state that,> “Another important question must be raised: even when a supposed virus does> kill cells in a test-tube (in vitro) ... can we safely conclude that these> findings can be carried over to a living organism (in vivo)?”The assumption that a particular ‘viral particle’ causes a particular‘infection’ is solely based on the claim that certain antibodies have sometimesbeen found in samples extracted from some people exhibiting certain symptoms; inother words, there appears to be a correlation between symptoms and antibodies.It should be noted that viruses are not detected directly.However, many people are diagnosed as suffering from a ‘viral illness’ withoutany investigations or tests having been conducted to ascertain whether they havebeen infected by an allegedly pathogenic virus. A diagnosis is frequently basedon the different symptoms that a patient experiences and reports to theirdoctor. People can also be discovered to have a ‘virus’ in their bodies withoutexhibiting the specific symptoms of the disease it is alleged to cause; this isclaimed to represent the ‘dormant’ stage of the virus, as discussed on the EoLweb page that states,> “Although viruses may cause disruption of normal homeostasis resulting in> disease, in some cases viruses may simply reside inside an organism without> significant harm.”Although the virus may be ‘dormant’ and therefore harmless, it is claimed thatthere is a potential for the virus to be ‘activated’ and to initiate therelevant disease. In their efforts to justify the existence of an allegedly‘dormant’ virus in the body, the medical establishment has created the term‘latent infection’. The following extract from the Yale Medical group websitepage entitled All About Viruses shows how the medical establishment attempts toexplain what is clearly an anomaly,> “Varicella viruses are examples of viruses that cause latent infections. The> varicella-zoster virus remains in the body after causing the initial infection> known as chicken pox. If it is re-activated, it travels through nerves to the> skin, where it causes the blister-like lesions of shingles. The virus then> returns to its dormant state.”Despite the claim that they explain ‘all about viruses’, these statements aremade without any supportive evidence; there is no explanation for any of thesestages of an allegedly ‘latent infection’; nor is there any explanation for themechanisms by which a virus becomes ‘dormant’ or is re-activated. Yet the ‘germtheory’ is still claimed to have been scientifically proven, and to provide acomprehensive and compelling explanation for ‘viruses’ and the ‘infectiousdiseases’ they are alleged to cause.There are only a very few brave scientists who have been prepared to contradictthe medical establishment and acknowledge publicly that viruses are notpathogenic. One such scientist is Dr Lynn Margulis, who states in SymbioticPlanet that,> “The point that bears mentioning, however, is that viruses are no more ‘germs’> and ‘enemies’ than are bacteria or human cells.”Another of these brave scientists is Dr Stefan Lanka PhD, a German biologist whostudied virology as well as molecular biology, ecology and marine biology.An interview with Dr Lanka was conducted in 2005 for the online German newspaperFaktuell. The interview, which has fortunately been translated into English,reveals that the topics of discussion included bird flu and vaccination. Duringthe interview Dr Lanka referred to his studies in molecular biology and made thebold claim that,> “In the course of my studies, I and others have not been able to find proof of> the existence of disease-causing viruses anywhere.”He continues to discuss his research and further explains that,> “Later we have discoursed on this publicly and have called on people not to> believe us either but to check out themselves whether or not there are disease> causing viruses.”He also stated in the interview that he and a number of other people had beenquestioning the German authorities for the ‘proof’ of pathogenic viruses. Hereports that the result of their efforts revealed that,> “…the health authorities are no longer maintaining that any virus whatsoever> purportedly causing a disease has been directly proven to exist.”This statement that no ‘disease-causing’ virus has been directly proven to existhighlights another crucial fact, which is that the ‘presence’ of a virus in thebody is not determined directly, but only through the detection of antibodiesthat the body is alleged to have produced against the virus; there is no testthat is able to directly detect the presence of a ‘whole virus’. The realpurpose and function within the human body of these particles of geneticmaterial contained within a protein coating are unknown; the claim that theycause disease remains entirely unproven.Dr Lanka was also interviewed in April 2016; this time by David Crowe for hisinternet programme, The Infectious Myth, on the Progressive Radio Network. Inthis interview Dr Lanka again asserted that there is no evidence that proves anyvirus to be the cause of any disease, and that the theories about infectiousdiseases are wrong. He also discussed the details of his recent court case thatarose from a challenge he had set a number of years earlier. This challenge wasthat a certain sum of money would be paid to anyone who produced genuinescientific ‘proof’ of the existence of the measles virus. The purpose of thischallenge was to expose the fallacy of the claim that measles is caused by avirus.In 2015 a German doctor accepted the challenge; the basis of his ‘proof’ was aset of six published papers that he claimed provided the necessary evidence. DrLanka, however, claimed that the papers did not contain the required evidence,and refuted the doctor’s claim to the ‘reward’ money. This dispute resulted in acourt case that found in favour of the German doctor. The court’s decision thatthe papers provided the required ‘proof’ and that Dr Lanka had therefore ‘lost’his case were widely reported in many media outlets, some of which alsocontained disparaging comments about Dr Lanka personally.However, Dr Lanka maintained his claim that the papers did not provide therequired proof and appealed against the court’s decision. The appeal was heardin early 2016 and the decision this time found in favour of Dr Lanka; in otherwords, it was found that the papers failed to provide the necessary ‘proof’. Themainstream media, however, were noticeably silent about the result of theappeal. The lack of media coverage of Dr Lanka’s successful appeal is revealing,especially as it coincided with reports about a number of ‘outbreaks’ of measlescases in the early months of 2016. But these reports studiously avoided makingany reference to the court case that had demonstrated that no evidence existsthat proves measles to be caused by a virus.It should be clear from this discussion that no disease is caused by a virus.In his interviews, Dr Lanka urges people to investigate for themselves if thereis any genuine evidence for any ‘disease-causing viruses’. The authors of thisbook make the same request and ask people to investigate for themselves whetherany ‘virus’ has been conclusively proven to be the cause of any infectiousdisease. Any investigation of this nature should involve contact with theorganisations that claim viruses to be the cause of disease to ask them thefollowing questions:> Is there an electron micrograph of the pure and fully characterised virus?> What is the name of the primary specialist peer reviewed paper in which the> virus is illustrated and its full genetic information described?> What is the name of the primary publication that provides proof that a> particular virus is the sole cause of a particular disease?It is vitally important that any documents referred to by the organisation,should they reply, must be primary papers; textbooks or other referencematerials that are not primary documents are not acceptable; they must provideprimary evidence.It should be noted that investigations of this nature, including thoseundertaken by virologists such as Dr Lanka, have failed to unearth any originalpapers that conclusively prove that any virus is the cause of any disease. Inaddition, as this discussion has demonstrated, the functions attributed toviruses in the causation of disease are based on assumptions and extrapolationsfrom laboratory experiments that have not only failed to prove, but areincapable of proving, that viruses cause disease. The inert, non-livingparticles known as viruses do not possess the ability to perform such functionsbecause they lack the necessary mechanisms.The real nature and causes of diseases claimed to be ‘viral’ are discussed ingreater detail in chapters four and ten.BacteriaBacteria, unlike viruses, are living organisms.However, like viruses, bacteria are erroneously accused of being pathogens.It first became possible to observe microorganisms when Antonie van Leeuwenhoekinvented his powerful microscope in 1676; however, as discussed, his study ofthese tiny entities did not involve an investigation of their possibleconnection with diseases.The first ‘germ theory of disease’ was proposed by Dr Plenciz in 1762, but itwas not until the 19th century that the Italian entomologist, Agostino Bassiperformed experiments that are alleged to be the first to provide ‘proof’ forthe theory. His initial investigations were in connection with a silkwormdisease; it is claimed that he discovered the cause of this disease to be amicroscopic fungus. This study led to further investigations, the result ofwhich was that in 1844 he proposed the theory that human diseases were alsocaused by microorganisms; his theory therefore precedes that of Louis Pasteur.During the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, many diseases were rife throughoutEurope; these diseases include typhus, cholera, tuberculosis and smallpox. It isclaimed that smallpox alone was responsible for nearly half a million deathseach year during the 18th century. It was during this period that treatments forthese diseases involved the use of measures that were described by William Whiteas ‘a combination of absurdity with nastiness’. It must be noted that theinsanitary conditions that existed in many of the towns and cities in Englandwere also prevalent in many of the towns and cities throughout Europe.However, this was also the period in which ‘science’ began its meteoric rise.The Scientific Revolution, which is said to have begun in the middle of the 16thcentury, saw many significant discoveries and inventions that overturnedlong-held ideas and beliefs about the world and how it worked.Unfortunately, scientific investigations in the field of ‘medicine’ did notsucceed in overturning the old belief that disease was the result of an attackby external entities. Instead, this basic assumption was retained and appearedto be supported by the discovery of microorganisms; a discovery that exerted,and continues to exert, a powerful influence on the direction of medicalresearch. However, appearances can often be deceptive; a maxim that has provento be entirely applicable to bacteria.Although Louis Pasteur is regarded as the father of the germ theory, it is DrRobert Koch who is regarded as the founder of modern bacteriology; nevertheless,like Louis Pasteur, Dr Koch is falsely venerated as a hero. It is widely claimedthat Dr Koch provided the necessary ‘proof’ that certain diseases were caused bycertain bacteria; but this is a mistaken claim, as will be demonstrated.In order for him to test his theory that bacteria were the causes of disease, DrKoch developed four Postulates that continue to bear his name. The firstPostulate, which is the most crucial for determining a causal agent of disease,comprises two criteria, the first of which is that the microbe alleged to causea specific disease must be found in all people suffering from that disease. Thesecond criterion is that the microbe should not be found in anyone who does nothave the disease it is claimed to cause. The logic of this first postulate isundeniable; any exception to either criterion means that the ‘microbe’ could notbe the causal agent of the disease in question. This logic is recognised by DrPeter Duesberg, who states in his book entitled Inventing the AIDS Virus that,> “A single exception would be enough to pronounce the microbe innocent of> creating that disease.”However, investigations of bacteria and their relationship to different diseasesreveal the existence of exceptions to both criteria of Koch’s first postulate;bacteria have been found in the bodies of people who do not have the diseasethey are alleged to cause, and the relevant bacteria have not been found in allpeople with the disease they are alleged to cause. The significance of theseexceptions is that they utterly refute the basic assumption that bacteria causedisease. These exceptions should have persuaded scientists like Dr Koch toreassess the ‘germ theory’, if not completely abandon it.There was, and still is, a great reluctance to abandon or even reassess thetheory; instead, efforts have been made to solve the anomalies raised by theseexceptions by making adaptations to the theory. But these adaptations do notresolve the underlying anomalies; on the contrary, they introduce additionalanomalies. The main problem is that the adapted theory retains the underlyingassumption that ‘bacteria’ are pathogens; but it is precisely this assumptionthat is fundamentally flawed.The adapted theory claims that people who have been found to ‘house’ bacteria,but not to have the disease they are alleged to cause, are ‘asymptomaticcarriers’. The implication of this label is that carriers can transmit theirbacteria to other people, who will then become ‘infected’ and fall ill with thedisease; but this label fails to clarify the situation and only raises furtherquestions.There are many aspects of the original and adapted theories that remainunexplained; for example, there are no explanations for the mechanism by whichbacteria are ‘transferred’ from the bodies of the ‘carrier’ to another person,or for the basic mechanism by which bacteria produce the variety of symptoms ofan infectious disease. There is also no explanation for the fact that‘asymptomatic carriers’ do not become ill; it is merely asserted that thesepeople have a ‘latent infection’. But this assertion offers no explanation forthe situation; the concept of a ‘latent infection’ directly contradicts the coreassertion of the ‘germ theory’ that bacterial infections cause disease.One alleged ‘pathogen’, that falls into the category of those that are said toproduce ‘asymptomatic carriers’, is the common bacterium called Staphylococcus.It is widely reported that a ‘Staph infection’ causes illness; it isnevertheless acknowledged that this bacterium can be found on the skin ofhealthy people. This anomalous situation fails Koch’s first postulate; thebacterium cannot therefore be regarded as a ‘pathogen’. The significance of thisbacterium is further discussed in the next section, because it is claimed to bea ‘superbug’ that causes a serious ‘MRSA infection’.Another example that demonstrates the fallacy of the claim that specificbacteria cause specific diseases, or any disease at all, is that of Dr MaxPettenkofer MD, who Eleanor McBean reports to have swallowed, on more than oneoccasion, the contents of a glass containing millions of cholera bacilli in fullview of a class of his students; yet it is reliably reported that Dr Pettenkoferfailed to succumb to the disease.Although it has been suggested by certain sections of the scientific communitythat Koch’s postulates are flawed, out-of-date and need to be revised, such asuggestion ignores the central point, which is that allegedly ‘pathogenic’bacteria can be found in abundance in and on the bodies of healthy people. Thesebacteria cannot therefore be regarded as pathogens merely on the basis that theyare sometimes found in some people who are ill. Dr Peter Duesberg states thelogical conclusion succinctly,> “Simply finding a microbe is not enough to convict it of causing a disease.”The analogy of discovering firemen at the scene of a fire and inappropriatelyaccusing them of being the cause is yet again pertinent.As discussed above, investigations also discovered a problem with the othercriterion of Koch’s first postulate, which states that the bacterium must alwaysbe present in people with the disease it is alleged to cause; many exceptions tothis ‘rule’ have also been found. In Orthopathy, Herbert Shelton provides someexamples, one of which is from an article published in the journal The Lancet in1898, which states that,> “Dr Beddow Bayly says that the diphtheria bacillus is missing in 14 per cent> of cases of clinical diphtheria.”Herbert Shelton cites a further example in which it had been found that 50 percent of TB (tuberculosis) cases had failed to exhibit the tubercle bacillus andquotes Dr Hadwen’s words that,> “Nobody has ever found a tubercle bacillus in the early stages of> tuberculosis.”If the tubercle bacillus were the cause of TB, it would always be present at thevery earliest stages of the disease. The significance of this example is that TBis one of the main diseases that Dr Koch is reputed to have ‘proven’ to becaused by a bacterium, and specifically by the tubercle bacillus. However,unlike the anomaly with the other component of the first postulate, there hasbeen no adaptation of the theory to explain the absence of the bacterium inpeople with the disease it is alleged to cause. The subject of TB is discussedin more detail in chapters four and eight, as it remains a disease ofsignificance.It is important to refer again to the work of Dr Hillman in respect ofobservations of samples under a microscope, especially in view of the fact thatbacteria are almost always fixed and stained before they are examined under amicroscope; these procedures are said to be able to make bacteria easier toobserve. It is reliably reported by many mainstream scientific sources that inhis investigations and observations of bacteria within ‘diseased tissue’, DrKoch used both fixing and staining preparation procedures. Whilst theseprocedures may assist the observation of bacteria, it is inappropriate to makeassumptions about the actions of bacteria in a living human body, merely fromobservations of their presence in diseased tissue samples viewed under amicroscope, after they have been subjected to fixing and staining processes. AsDr Lipton’s work showed, the condition of their environment has a direct effecton living samples, whether they are cells or bacteria.In addition to the observation of bacteria under microscopes, many experimentshave been conducted that are claimed to have ‘proved’ that bacteria aretransmitted between people and that they are capable of causing the same diseaseafter transmission. But the evidence, which shows that in many cases the ‘germ’is absent when it should be present or present when it should be absent, meansthat there are fundamental flaws in the theory that cannot be ‘proved’ byexperimentation. The monkey experiments used to ‘prove’ the transmission ofpolio is a pertinent example of flawed experimental methods that do not ‘prove’what they are claimed to prove.The assumption that bacteria are fundamentally pathogenic is continuallychallenged by discoveries about their real nature and functions.One of the acknowledged facts is that bacteria live in a variety of habitats; asrecognised by the establishment definition that states,> “Some live in soil, water or air...”However, the definition makes the additional claim that,> “…others are parasites of humans, animals and plants.”It is an error to refer to any bacterium as a parasite, the establishmentdefinition of which refers to an organism that contributes nothing to thewelfare of the host. Recent discoveries about bacteria show that some of theactions they perform include a number of vitally important functions thatsubstantially contribute to the welfare of a variety of hosts.Although the definition states that bacteria live in soil, their range ofhabitats in the ground extends beyond merely the soil; these habitats include,for example, the roots of certain plants in which they ‘fix’ the nitrogen fromthe atmosphere and convert it into the appropriate form for the plant to absorb.Bacteria also inhabit the digestive systems of animals, including humans; theirfunctions in these habitats include processing foods to allow the release ofvital nutrients for absorption into the body.It has been estimated that the human body contains approximately 50 trillioncells; it has also been estimated that the human body contains a similar numberof bacteria. It is abundantly clear that the human body is one of their naturalhabitats; which means it is therefore totally inappropriate to refer to bacteriaas ‘invaders’ or as parasites of humans, or of any other living organism.The discussion earlier in this chapter about the microorganisms that normallylive in and on the body is particularly relevant to this section, as bacteriaare by far the most common endogenous microorganisms; they are also the mostoften claimed to be simultaneously harmless and harmful. This anomaly isdemonstrated by a July 2017 article entitled Commensal-to-pathogen transition:One-single transposon insertion results in two pathoadaptive traits inEscherichia coli-macrophage interaction, which states that,> “Escherichia coli is both a harmless commensal in the intestines of many> mammals, as well as a dangerous pathogen.”The article claims that genes are one of the factors that contribute to thebacteria’s ability to ‘switch’ from harmless to harmful; but it also exposes thepoor level of understanding about the processes involved in such a ‘switch’ inthe comment that,> “Our understanding of how often and by which mechanisms bacteria transit from> a commensal to a pathogenic lifestyle is still far from complete.”This lack of a complete understanding raises questions about the underlyingassumption that bacteria make such a transition; the discussions in this sectionwill demonstrate that there is no evidence that any bacterium is or becomes a‘dangerous pathogen’.Bacteria are extremely hardy; they live under some of the most extremeconditions, from extreme cold to extreme heat; they also live in some of themost hostile environments, such as deep-sea hydrothermal vents. Some types ofbacteria require oxygen for their survival, others cannot survive in thepresence of oxygen. Some even have the ability to become dormant, if theconditions require it.Bacteria can therefore be said to be truly ubiquitous.It has been shown that bacteria are one of the most ancient ‘life-forms’ onEarth; their single-celled ancestors appeared at least three and a half billionyears ago. Dr Peter Duesberg, a molecular biologist and also a member of theprestigious NAS, makes the comment in Inventing the AIDS Virus that,> “Microbes lived on this planet long before humans. We coexist with a sea of> microbes and benefit from many, including those that naturally reside in the> human body.”There is, in reality, a very fundamental relationship between bacteria and allother life-forms on Earth; biologist Dr Lynn Margulis explains this relationshipin her 1998 book, Symbiotic Planet,> “All life, we now know, evolved from the smallest life-forms of all,> bacteria.”Although this is an acknowledged fact within biology, the ‘information’promulgated by the medical establishment remains focused on the idea thatbacteria are pathogens; even though it has been recognised that mostmicroorganisms are not pathogenic.This is an inconsistency that continues to have serious consequences; it istherefore extremely important to expose the fallacy of the claim that anybacterium is a pathogen.From the earliest investigations of bacteria, they have always been categorisedas ‘germs’ and therefore as primary causal agents of disease. To the scientistsof the 19th century, it seemed that the only relevant investigations to conductwere those that would discover which specific bacterium was the cause of whichspecific disease. Although shown to be erroneous, this approach has persistedthroughout the field of medical research and has continued into the early 21stcentury.There have, however, been some scientists who have investigated bacteria from adifferent perspective and realised that ‘science’ had misunderstood thesemicroorganisms. One such scientist is Dr Ivan Wallin PhD, a microbiologist, whoinvestigated the behaviour and functions of bacteria; the result of his work ledhim to state in 1927 that,> “Above all, it must be emphasised that our knowledge of the behaviour of> bacteria is decidedly limited.”Unfortunately, the vast majority of Dr Wallin’s peers were firmly of the opinionthat bacteria were fundamentally pathogenic and refused to consider any otherview.Although knowledge about the behaviour and functions of bacteria has expandedsince 1927, the medical establishment retains its intransigence. There is acontinuing reluctance to relinquish the ‘germ theory’, for a variety of reasons,many of which are discussed in chapter nine; however, these reasons obviouslyinclude the fact that to do so would necessitate fundamental changes to theprevailing ‘healthcare system’.Erroneous ideas about bacteria are slowly being changed as the result of newdiscoveries, and replaced with knowledge of their real functions, some of whichare:> Bacteria are saprotrophic, which means that they feed on and break down dead> organisms and release the nutrients back into the environment to be utilised> by other organisms.> Bacteria break down waste products and are used in sewage treatment plants for> just such a purpose.> Bacteria are involved in the cycles of important elements such as oxygen,> nitrogen and carbon.The discovery that bacteria are saprotrophic has profound implications, one ofwhich is that it provides the most plausible explanation for their presencewithin diseased tissue. It is fully acknowledged within the wider field ofscience that bacteria are part of the community of ‘decomposers’ that break downdead organic matter, which includes the bodies of animals and humans. Theirability to decompose dead organic matter, which results in the release ofnutrients into the ‘environment’, should not be considered to be a function thatis performed solely on the death of an animal or human and only occurs in theexternal environment.Human cells die every day; it is part of the normal processes of ‘life’, whichinclude the processes necessary for the elimination of dead cells from the body.In addition to the dead cells that require removal is the added burden ofdamaged cells; this damage can occur as the result of different factors, but ismainly the result of exposures to toxins. The fact that bacteria act assaprotrophs means that they perform the function of decomposing damaged as wellas dead materials within the body; a function that is similar to the break-downof food in the digestive system that results in the release of nutrients in theappropriate form for the body to absorb.Another erroneous idea maintained by the medical establishment relates to bloodand the bloodstream; as indicated by a December 2002 article entitled, Are ThereNaturally Occurring Pleomorphic Bacteria in the Blood of Healthy Humans whichstates that,> “In our search for spirochetes involved in Alzheimer’s disease, we observed> pleomorphic bacteria in the blood of healthy human subjects…”The article reports that the observation of bacteria in the blood of healthyhuman subjects was ‘surprising’; the reason that this is described as a surpriseis because the bloodstream has long been believed to be a ‘sterile’ environment;but this is a mistaken belief. The medical establishment claims that thepresence of bacteria in the blood represents an ‘infection’ or blood poisoning,also known as sepsis or septicaemia; but this too is erroneous; bacteria do not‘infect’ or ‘poison’ the blood.Although the article refers to the search for a spirochete, a type of bacterium,in Alzheimer’s disease, there is a great deal of evidence that demonstrates afar closer association between this disease and neurotoxins, particularlyaluminium; the neurotoxic effects of aluminium were discussed in chapter two.However, the idea that bacteria may be involved in Alzheimer’s diseasedemonstrates just how deeply embedded the ‘germ theory’ is in the search for thecausal agents of a wide variety of diseases, despite the huge volume of evidencedemonstrating the existence of other and far more plausible causal factors.Bacteria are single-celled organisms that, over the course of many billions ofyears of evolution, have developed into many forms. It has been discovered thatthe development of larger life-forms has occurred through a process calledsymbiosis. Dr Ivan Wallin PhD was one of the first proponents of the idea ofsymbiotic relationships; he was the first to recognise combinations ofsingle-celled bacteria and their development into more complex multicellularlife-forms.In his 1927 book entitled Symbionticism and the origin of species, Dr Wallinexplains the idea of symbiotic relationships and how, as the title suggests,they have played a significant role in the development of new species. His ideaswere, unfortunately, rejected by his peers, who remained committed to the dogmathat bacteria are fundamentally pathogenic. Fortunately, his ideas have not beentotally ignored; one scientist who has followed and expanded upon his work is DrLynn Margulis, who has also recognised the erroneous theories about bacteria, asshe explains in Symbiotic Planet,> “Microbes, especially bacteria, are touted as enemies and denigrated as> germs.”Unfortunately, Dr Wallin abandoned his research because of the attitude of hispeers; a situation that substantially impeded the progress of scientificinvestigation in this field until Dr Margulis began to research his work andfurther develop his ideas. Whilst the evolution of new species, a major aspectof her research, is extremely interesting, it is not pertinent to the currentdiscussion.One of the most important aspects of Dr Wallin’s work is that it demonstratesthat bacteria are the foundation of all ‘life’, which thoroughly refutes theclaim that any of them can be ‘pathogenic’. One of Dr Wallin’s most profounddiscoveries was in respect of mitochondria, which are organelles that arepresent within most cells of animals, the main exception being red blood cells.Dr Wallin discovered that mitochondria are bacterial in origin and that,> “…mitochondria are living organisms, symbiotically combined within the cells> of animals.”Plants have similar organelles, called plastids, which, like the mitochondria ofanimals, are also bacterial in origin.The fact that mitochondria and plastids are bacterial in origin is acknowledgedwithin mainstream cell biology, as indicated by the 2002 textbook entitledMolecular Biology of the Cell, which states that,> “It is widely accepted that mitochondria and plastids evolved from bacteria…”What is most surprising, considering the ramifications of this discovery, isthat the idea that these organelles were produced from symbiotic relationshipswith bacteria is no longer controversial, as Dr Margulis explains,> “Acceptance of symbiotic origin for mitochondria and plastids was finalised> with the discovery that both these kinds of organelles contain distinct DNA,> separate from that of the nucleus and unequivocally bacterial in style and> organization.”Unfortunately, this information is not widely promulgated to the general public,who are constantly ‘informed’ that bacteria are dangerous pathogens, despite thefact that most cells in the human body contain mitochondria that are bacterialin origin.Mitochondria perform an extremely important function, which is that ofgenerating energy for the cell; this energy is in the form of a chemical calledadenosine triphosphate (ATP), without an adequate production of which cells inthe living organism would fail to function properly. The bacterial origin ofmitochondria demonstrates the erroneous nature of the idea that bacteria arefundamental parasites that contribute nothing to the welfare of the host. Thereare serious consequences from the failure of the medical establishment torecognise the scientifically established facts about bacteria; the mainconsequence relates to the continuing use of antibiotics to ‘kill’ allegedlypathogenic bacteria; antibiotics are discussed in the next section.The significance of bacteria to all forms of ‘life’ is indicated by Dr Margulis,who states in Symbiotic Planet that,> “We evolved from a long line of progenitors, ultimately from the first> bacteria. Most evolution occurred in those beings we dismiss as ‘microbes’.”Recognition of the importance of bacteria to all ‘life’ obviously poses aserious and direct challenge to the ‘germ theory’; the sums of money invested inthe applications derived from it are far too large to readily permit arevelation that the theory is fatally flawed. The influence of ‘vestedinterests’, which is discussed in detail in chapter nine, is a major deterrentto any scientific investigation that would pose a challenge to their dominance;this means that investigations likely to question the ‘consensus’ view requireefforts that are rarely acknowledged or appreciated, as Dr Margulis indicates,> “Our culture ignores the hard-won fact that these disease ‘agents’, these> ‘germs’, also germinated all life.”It is a commonplace within science for new ideas to be ‘hard-won’, but it isbecoming increasingly difficult for certain new ideas to be accepted, especiallyif they do not accord with the ‘consensus’ view. The problems with therequirement for all scientists to accept and support the ‘consensus’ are alsodiscussed in chapter nine.One of the many fascinating attributes of bacteria is their ability to changetheir form; an attribute referred to as pleomorphism. Science orthodoxy almostexclusively teaches bacterial monomorphism, which means that all forms with thesame shape belong to the same species but do not change into other forms. Ithas, however, been acknowledged that there are some exceptions to the rule ofbacterial monomorphism, but that these exceptions are restricted to only a fewtypes of bacteria and occur in only specific circumstances.Pleomorphism is not, however, a newly recognised phenomenon. In his 1938 bookentitled Impaired Health: Its Cause and Cure, Dr John Tilden MD discusses thechanges that bacteria can undergo and, although he does not use the term‘pleomorphism’, it is clear that this is the phenomenon he refers to in thefollowing statement,> “That the explorers of the microscopic world have some excuse for the infinite> number of varieties already discovered, there is no question; for these> infinitely small beings have the habit of taking on an individuality, or> personality, in keeping with the chemic changes of the medium with which they> are correlated.”The phenomenon of pleomorphism was discussed even earlier by Dr Ivan Wallin inhis 1927 book, in which he states that,> “It has further been established that the morphology of a microorganism may be> altered by changing the environmental factors.”Dr Wallin refers to pleomorphism exhibited by mitochondria, which is notsurprising considering that the genetic material of mitochondria is bacterial innature. However, he refers to experiments that had investigated the effects ofphosphorus poisoning on mitochondria, which were discovered to have undergonepleomorphic modifications. These experiments clearly corroborate the assertionthat bacteria are affected by the chemical nature and composition of theirenvironment.Unfortunately, the scientific community has great difficulties in acceptingpleomorphism as a phenomenon exhibited by most, if not all, bacteria; asituation that Dr Milton Wainwright PhD discusses in his 1997 article entitledExtreme Pleomorphism and the bacterial life cycle: a forgotten controversy, inwhich he states that,> “Nearly all modern microbiologists belong to the monomorphic school…”Although he states that most microbiologists reject pleomorphism, it isnevertheless, a genuine phenomenon; the demand for scientific consensus deniesthe emergence of new ideas, which impedes scientific progress. Fortunately,there is a growing recognition of pleomorphism, even if of a limited nature, asDr Wainwright indicates,> “Reports of the existence of limited pleomorphism continue to appear somewhat> infrequently in the modern literature.”One group of bacteria that are acknowledged to be ‘highly pleomorphic’ areRickettsiae, which include the bacterium claimed to be the causal agent oftyphus, which Florence Nightingale claimed was not caused by a ‘new infection’but by the worsening conditions within the hospital wards.Another bacterium known to be pleomorphic is Deinococcus radiodurans; which,interestingly, has not been claimed to be the causal agent of any disease. A2009 article entitled, Nutrition induced pleomorphism and budding mode ofreproduction in Deinococcus radiodurans states that the researchers,> “…observed different forms of the bacterium morphology by varying the culture> medium concentration.”Although the researchers only varied the concentration of the culture medium,these changes nevertheless resulted in the bacteria altering their formsaccording to the nature of the environment in which they were placed. Theobservation of different morphologies demonstrates that bacteria are highlyadaptable and that they adapt their form according to the conditions of theenvironment they inhabit.The article also provides an interesting revelation in the admission that,> “The conflicting aspect of the true morphology of the bacterium in natural> environment and observed morphology in laboratory conditions always posed> questions to microbiologists.”This ‘conflict’ demonstrates that bacteria exhibit different behaviours withinthe confines of the laboratory from those within their natural environment; italso emphasises the serious consequences that can arise from assumptions madefrom the results of laboratory experiments that are extrapolated to ‘nature’ andto situations in the real world. The article reveals that most microbiologistsdo not have an adequate level of knowledge about bacteria in one of their‘natural’ habitats; the living human body.Although pleomorphism is acknowledged to exist, most medical establishmentsources interpret the phenomenon to refer to changes that merely involve a‘variation’ in the shape or size of bacteria rather than a complete change intheir form. This denial of the existence of full pleomorphism is anothersituation that can be attributed to the rigid adherence to the dogma thatbacteria are ‘germs’; that they cause disease and therefore need to be killed byantibiotic medicines or prevented by vaccines. Dr Wainwright was certainly awareof the difficulties of gaining acceptance by the medical establishment for theconcept of full or ‘extreme’ pleomorphism; he states that,> “While claims for such limited pleomorphism offend no one, modern reports of> extreme pleomorphism are likely to suffer derision, or more usually just be> ignored.”Deriding claims and ignoring evidence do not constitute a scientific method ofdisproving the veracity of claims about any phenomena.It is obvious that pleomorphism does not fit the existing ‘consensus’ view ofbacteria; but it does provide a compelling explanation for the variety ofbacterial forms that are often mistakenly believed to be distinctly differententities, each of which is claimed to be the causal agent of a distinctlydifferent disease.It is the contention of some people, particularly in the ‘alternative health’community, that bacteria only become pathogenic under certain conditions; thatthey only play a secondary role in disease. This view claims that bacteria arenot the original cause of disease, but that they proliferate as the directresult of disease. It is further claimed that it is the proliferation of thebacteria that directly contributes to the worsening of the disease due to the‘toxins’ released by these ‘bad’ bacteria.The idea that ‘bacterial toxins’ are the causes of many illnesses isfundamentally flawed; the main reason is due to the normal presence in the bodyof many trillions of bacteria. If only a tiny percentage of the trillions ofbacteria in the body produced ‘toxins’ people would always be ill, from themoment of birth and throughout their entire lives. If any of these toxins weretruly ‘deadly’, it raises the question of how life could ever have begun,considering that bacteria are one of the earliest ‘life-forms’.In his book entitled Food Is Your Best Medicine, Dr Henry Bieler MD discussesthe role of bacteria and explains why they are found in diseased tissue,> “After the cells have been damaged by toxic wastes, it is easy for bacteria,> as scavengers, to attack and devour the weakened, injured and dead cells.”His use of the word ‘scavenger’ and his description of bacterial activity as an‘attack’ may appear misleading, but Dr Bieler does not accuse bacteria ofcausing disease; he is expressing recognition of their function as decomposersof dead and damaged cells.The idea that bacteria play a secondary role in disease has also been claimed tohave been proved by experiments in which examination of diseased tissue in itsearly stages revealed no bacteria, but that later stages of the disease revealedthe presence of bacteria. A suggestion of this kind ignores the acknowledgedfact that bacteria are saprotrophic; a fact that fully explains their presenceat the site of severely damaged tissue, which is to be ‘decomposed’ andeliminated from the body.Organic materials are acknowledged to be decomposed through ‘biodegradation’,which refers to the processes carried out by microorganisms, especiallybacteria; this clearly demonstrates that the scientific community recognisesthat bacteria are saprotrophic. A number of investigations have discovered thatmany different materials can be biodegraded by different organisms.The use of microorganisms to biodegrade environmental pollutants is known by theterm ‘bioremediation’; as indicated by a July 2010 article entitled MicrobialDegradation of Petroleum Hydrocarbon Contaminants: An Overview, which discussesbioremediation and states that,> “Many indigenous microorganisms in water and soil are capable of degrading> hydrocarbon contaminants.”Bacteria are not the only decomposers, other organisms have also been recognisedto be saprotrophic; however, bacteria are particularly effective in thebiodegradation of important environmental pollutants, as the article states,> “Bacteria are the most active agents in petroleum degradation... Several> bacteria are even known to feed exclusively on hydrocarbons.”This therefore demonstrates an extremely useful and beneficial property ofbacteria, but their usefulness in the processes of bioremediation should not beused to justify the continued production and use of petrochemical products thatpollute and contaminate the environment; as will be discussed in greater detailin chapter six.Bacteria are also capable of biodegrading many other pollutants, such as heavymetals, as indicated by a 1998 article entitled Physical properties and heavymetal uptake of encapsulated Escherichia coli expressing a metal binding gene.This article is extremely revealing because E. coli are regarded as a majorcause of food poisoning, but it is also widely recognised that E. coli normallyreside in the intestines of healthy people. These bacteria are regarded as bothcommensal and pathogenic; the anomalous nature of this claim was previouslymentioned. The fact that they are found in healthy people who do not suffer from‘food poisoning’ is a situation that fails to meet Koch’s first postulate, whichmeans that E. coli cannot be the cause of any disease, including ‘foodpoisoning’.The CDC website provides information about E. coli on a page entitled What areEscherichia coli? which includes the following surprising admission,> “It does get a bit confusing – even to microbiologists.”The idea that microbiologists are confused about any bacterium demonstrates thatthere are serious and fundamental problems with the ‘germ theory’ on which theybase their work, and also corroborates the assertion that the medicalestablishment possesses a poor level of understanding about thesemicroorganisms.There is certainly a great deal of information about bacteria still to bediscovered. Nevertheless, the knowledge that has accumulated since Dr Kochconducted his experiments in the late 19th century demonstrates that his theorythat they are the causes of disease needs to be abandoned. The growing weight ofevidence shows that the real functions of bacteria are far from‘disease-causing’; their role is an important one that is vital for thecontinuing existence of life on Earth.Dr Margulis, in particular, recognised the amazing attributes of bacteria andwas able to contemplate them from a completely different perspective than thatof most scientists, as indicated by her comment that,> “Life is an incredibly complex interdependence of matter and energy among> millions of species beyond (and within) our own skin.”Life is indeed complex and interdependent. The world is not a battleground, inwhich the germs must be killed, because clearly what kills the germs will surelykill all life-forms.Dr Stefan Lanka provides an eloquent summary in his 2005 interview for Faktuell,> “The basis of biological life is togetherness, is symbiosis, and in this there> is no place for war and destruction.”Antibiotics, Resistance and ‘Superbugs’The establishment definition of an antibiotic refers to it as,> “a substance, produced by or derived from a microorganism, that destroys or> inhibits the growth of other microorganisms.”Antibiotics are used primarily in the treatment of ‘bacterial infections’; theyare considered to be ineffective for ‘viral infections’.The first antibiotic to be developed was penicillin, which is widely acclaimedas one of the greatest achievements of ‘modern medicine’.Nothing could be further from the truth.The discussion in the first section of this chapter revealed that the medicalestablishment is fully aware of the fact that most bacteria are harmless. Thediscussion in the previous section revealed that the medical establishment isfully aware of the fact that many trillions of bacteria normally reside withinthe human body. These revelations demonstrate that the use of antibiotics todestroy bacteria in the name of ‘healthcare’ is an error of incalculableproportions.The justification for their use is that antibiotics are claimed to have theability to ‘target’ bacterial cells, as indicated by a March 2006 articleentitled How do antibiotics kill bacterial cells but not human cells thatstates,> “It is the selective action of antibiotics against bacteria that makes them> useful in the treatment of infections...”The explanation within the article includes the claim that,> “…modern antibiotics act either on processes that are unique to bacteria...or> on bacterium-specific targets.”Chapter one demonstrated that pharmaceuticals are incapable of only acting on aspecific ‘target’. The same applies to antibiotics; the fact that they do notsolely act on ‘bad’ bacteria is acknowledged by the establishment definitionwhich states that,> “They may alter the normal microbial content of the body (e.g. in the> intestine, lungs, bladder) by destroying one or more groups of harmless or> beneficial organisms...”The fact that the bacterial community within the human body is estimated tonumber many tens of trillions may imply that the loss of some beneficial groupsis not a serious problem. But this is a flawed idea; more importantly, it missesthe salient point, which is that antibiotics cause damage and their effects arenot limited to the bacterial cells they are claimed to ‘target’.Dr Henry Bieler MD, who studied the functions of the endocrine glands, explainsin Food is Your Best Medicine the real mechanism of action of penicillin in thebody,> “Penicillin often accomplishes truly miraculous results by whipping the> endocrine glands into hyperactivity.”Although Dr Bieler refers to ‘miraculous results’ it is clear that he does notmean that penicillin ‘works’ as it is claimed to do; instead, he explains thatthe endocrine glands respond to the toxicity of penicillin and stimulate thebody to expel it. This is shown by his further comment about penicillin, whichhe refers to as,> “…so toxic that it is thrown out by the kidneys just a few seconds after it is> injected…”There are many different types of antibiotics, penicillin is just one, althoughsome of the most commonly used antibiotics are of the penicillin family; theforms in which antibiotics are administered include pills and liquids as well asinjections.The key point is that, whatever their type or form, all antibiotics areinherently toxic; they are produced with the specific intention of destroyingmicroorganisms; but their effects cause harm to more than their intended target‘victim’. As Dr Bieler has indicated, the endocrine glands are affected by thetoxicity of the antibiotics and, in particular, it is the adrenal glands thatare stimulated to release large volumes of their secretions into thebloodstream. The hyperactivity of the adrenals may result in the reduction ofpain, fever and certain other symptoms, but these benefits have not beenachieved by the action of the antibiotics; they are only achieved by the actionsof the body.It is clear, therefore, that antibiotics perform no ‘miracle’.Their ability to cause harm has been recognised, albeit to a limited extent, bythe medical establishment; for example, the UK NHS states that,> “The most common side effects of antibiotics affect the digestive system.”The ‘side effects’ listed include vomiting and diarrhoea, both of which aredirect effects of the ingestion of the antibiotic drugs and are clearindications of the body’s efforts to eliminate substances recognised to betoxic.The medical establishment does make one claim that is correct; this is the claimthat antibiotics are overused; but this is an understatement because antibioticsshould never be used, for all of the reasons discussed in this chapter.A recent development in the treatment of ‘bacterial infections’ is thatantibiotics appear to be losing their effectiveness; a situation that is claimedto be the result of their overuse, and interpreted to be caused by the abilityof the microbes to develop ‘resistance’ to the drugs used to combat them.The poor level of understanding about the functions of the human body, inconjunction with the rigid adherence to the ‘germ theory’, continue to inspirethe medical establishment to generate theories that bear little or noresemblance to reality. This situation is demonstrated by the February 2018 WHOfact sheet entitled Antibiotic resistance, which claims that,> “A growing number of infections...are becoming harder to treat as the> antibiotics used to treat them become less effective.”Although no explanation is offered for the mechanism by which bacteria develop‘resistance’ to antibiotics, the fact sheet claims that,> “Antibiotic resistance occurs naturally, but misuse of antibiotics in humans> and animals is accelerating the process.”This claim is fundamentally flawed; it is the use of antibiotics, not their‘misuse’ that is the cause of this problem.It may be that the pleomorphic nature of bacteria enables them to adapt theirmorphology and develop resistance to antibiotics; but the refusal to recognisethe existence of bacterial pleomorphism has impeded a thorough investigation of‘drug resistance’ and, if this is a genuine phenomenon, the mechanism of actionby which this is accomplished. However, whatever the mechanism by whichresistance occurs, this is not the real issue; the fundamental problem is thebelief that bacteria are ‘germs’ that need to be destroyed and the developmentand use of toxic substances to kill them.The reason that antibiotics appear to have become less effective in thetreatment of ‘bacterial infections’ is due to a mistaken belief about theirmechanism of action within the body. If an ‘infection’ fails to heal after aninitial course of antibiotics, additional courses will often be prescribed; butthese drugs only continue to stimulate the endocrine system and especially theadrenal glands. The result of this prolonged stimulation is that these glandswill become weakened, which will impair their ability to perform theirfunctions, some of which are extremely important, such as controlling metabolismand activating the body’s response to stress.Repeated courses of antibiotics will precipitate further and more serious healthproblems, which may be interpreted as the loss of effectiveness of theantibiotics and drug resistance, or as being another ‘disease’ for which thepatient will be treated with another course of similarly toxic pharmaceuticaldrugs. One of the possible outcomes from repeated courses of antibiotics is anincreased risk of cancer; as indicated by an April 2017 article entitledAntibiotic ‘link to bowel cancer precursor’ which states that,> “People who take antibiotics for a long time are more likely to develop> growths on the bowel which can be a precursor to cancer, a study suggests.”The long-term use of antibiotics will never resolve health problems, because, asDr Bieler states,> “Stimulating an exhausted body by means of drugs is just as nonsensical as> whipping a tired horse to make it work.”The endocrine system, which is discussed in more detail in chapters six andseven, regulates a wide variety of vital processes throughout the body; it istherefore a matter of extreme importance that this system functions asefficiently as possible.In addition to the perceived problem of ‘antibiotic resistance’ is that of‘antimicrobial resistance’, which, according to the February 2018 WHO fact sheetentitled Antimicrobial resistance,> “…threatens the effective prevention and treatment of an ever-increasing range> of infections caused by bacteria, parasites, viruses and fungi.”The discussions throughout this chapter demonstrate that this statement isfundamentally flawed.The erroneous claim that microbes cause infections and the mistaken ideas aboutantibiotics have led to the creation of another category of ‘germs’. These are‘superbugs’, a label used to describe bacteria that are claimed to have becomeresistant to many widely-used antibiotics. One of the most common superbugs iscalled MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), the establishmentdefinition of which is,> “an increasingly common dangerous bacterium that is resistant to many> antibiotics.”Methicillin is an antibiotic of the penicillin family.The establishment definition of Staphylococcus states that,> “Some species are saprophytes; others parasites.”The discussion in the previous section showed that this bacterium, which can befound in many parts of the body, especially the skin, hair, nose and throat, iscommonly found in healthy people. This situation defies Koch’s first postulate;a bacterium that can be found in healthy people cannot be a pathogen; itcertainly cannot be described as dangerous.It is claimed that only ‘some’ strains of this bacterium are resistant toantibiotics, but this does not mean that any strain is able to cause disease. Itshould be noted that Staphylococcus is recognised to be pleomorphic; which mayprovide an insight into a likely explanation for their appearance in many‘strains’ and for their apparent ‘resistance’ to antibiotics in laboratorycell-culture experiments.The concern about the overuse of antibiotics is certainly justified; but thesolution to this problem is not justifiable, because it is proposed that better,meaning stronger, antibiotics need to be developed to tackle ‘superbugs’. Manyfear-mongering reports have been generated about the possible consequences if asolution cannot be found; a typical example of which is a May 2016 articleentitled Global antibiotics ‘revolution’ needed that claims,> “Superbugs, resistant to antimicrobials, are estimated to account for 700,000> deaths each year.”The article also reports that this number is estimated to increase to 10 millionby the year 2050 if the ‘problem’ is not solved. It should be clear that‘better’ antibiotics cannot provide the solution to this problem; instead theywill exacerbate the situation. As increasing numbers of people take repeatedcourses of stronger and more toxic antibiotics, they will certainly suffer fromworsening health problems.The UK Government commissioned a review to investigate the problem ofresistance; the result of which was a report entitled Review on AntimicrobialResistance that is available from the website (amr-review.org); the reportclaims that,> “Routine surgeries and minor infections will become life-threatening once> again and the hard won victories against infectious diseases of the last fifty> years will be jeopardized.”These claims are unfounded; the use of antibiotics is not the reason that theseso-called ‘infectious diseases’ ceased to be ‘life-threatening’.One of the reasons for the reduction in mortality after surgery was due to theintroduction of hygienic practices for surgeons. The credit for this success isusually attributed to Dr Ignaz Semmelweis, who, in the mid-19th century,recommended that surgeons wash their hands in between each operation.Unfortunately, this hygienic practice is usually reported as being a goodexample of ‘infection control’; but the use of the word ‘infection’ is onlycorrect in the context of a reference to something that pollutes orcontaminates.Prior to these hygienic practices, many surgeons did not thoroughly wash theirhands between operations; their hands would therefore be contaminated by bloodand other bodily matter from their previous patient, and it was this ‘matter’that poisoned the patient on whom the surgeon next operated. It was as theresult of this ‘noxious matter’ introduced into their bodies that patientssuffered from ‘blood poisoning’, which led to a high rate of post-surgicalmortality; it was not due to an infection with a ‘germ’.Until it is realised that bacteria are not an ‘enemy’ that must be destroyed,the continuing use of antibiotics will continue to pose health problems ofever-increasing intensity for increasing numbers of people around the world.It is clear that the real problem to be solved is the rigid adherence by themedical establishment to the ‘germ theory’; it is only when they cease tobelieve in ‘germs’ as the causes of disease that the use of antibiotics willalso finally cease.Other ‘Germs’The previous discussion referred to the WHO claim that ‘antimicrobialresistance’ poses a serious threat to effective treatments for ‘infections’caused by a variety of pathogens. Although viruses and bacteria are consideredthe most common, they are not the only microorganisms claimed to be pathogenic.The establishment definition of a pathogen refers to a microorganism that is aparasite, the establishment definition of which is,> “any living thing that lives in or on another living organism.”This definition also includes the claim that,> “Human parasites include fungi, bacteria, viruses, protozoa and worms.”The impression conveyed by these two statements is that the terms pathogen andparasite are virtually synonymous.The previous discussions about viruses and bacteria have demonstrated thefundamentally erroneous nature of the claim that either of them is parasitic orpathogenic. This error means that the other microorganisms referred to aspathogens also require discussion to demonstrate that they too are fundamentallymisunderstood and incorrectly classified as ‘germs’.There is, however, an exception; worms are not microorganisms; and they onlybecome ‘parasites’ under very specific circumstances.FungiFungi are neither plants nor animals; they belong to a separate biologicalclassification.The establishment definition of fungus claims that,> “They live either as saprophytes or as parasites of plants and animals…”The website of the RHS (Royal Horticultural Society) explains more specificallythat,> “The vast majority of fungi are saprophytic…”It is technically incorrect to use the term ‘saprophytic’ for fungi, because thesuffix ‘_phyt’ is derived from the Greek word for ‘plant’ and fungi are notplants; the correct term is saprotrophic.The RHS statement indicates that it is only a small minority of fungi that canbe referred to as ‘parasites’; saprotrophs are not parasitic. This raises thequestion of whether any types of fungus can be referred to as either parasiticor pathogenic.The 1996 4th edition of the textbook Medical Microbiology is accessible on theNIH website. Chapter 74 of this book was written by Dr George Kobayashi PhD, whoindicates that fungi are not fundamentally pathogenic,> “Fungi rarely cause disease in healthy immunocompetent hosts.”Dr Kobayashi does, however, claim that some fungi cause disease.The reference to a healthy immune system that is able to prevent a fungaldisease is identical to the explanation used for people who are allegedly‘infected’ by either a bacterium or a virus, but who fail to become ill. Thismeans that, like viruses and bacteria, fungi cannot be fundamentally pathogenicif their ability to cause disease requires other factors to be involved in theprocess.The discussion about bacteria demonstrated that their attribute of beingsaprotrophic has a beneficial function for the human body. The fact that fungiare also recognised as saprotrophic therefore requires a reassessment of theirpresence in the body.It is claimed that many types of fungus can cause ‘infections’ in the body. Onetype of fungus alleged to do so is Candida; but this yeast is recognised to beyet another normal resident of the human body. Its ability to cause ‘infection’is said to be triggered by an imbalance in the normal microbial community, andthat it is this imbalance that causes an overgrowth of Candida. One of thecauses of an imbalance is attributed to the overuse of antibiotics.A particularly interesting statement made by Dr Kobayashi more than two decadesago in the textbook cited above, is that,> “A few fungi have developed a commensal relationship with humans and are part> of the indigenous microbial flora…”The term commensal refers to a relationship in which one organism benefits fromanother but without adversely affecting it. This indicates the existence of avery different relationship between fungus and host from that of a parasiticone.Scientific investigations continue to produce some interesting discoveries aboutthe variety of normal ‘inhabitants’ of the human body; as indicated by a May2013 article entitled The emerging world of the fungal microbiome which statesthat,> “Every human has fungi as part of their microbiota, but the total number of> fungal cells is orders of magnitude smaller than that of the bacterial> microbiota.”The presence of different fungi in the body is therefore not the result of an‘invasion’; they should therefore not be regarded as ‘parasites’. The articlealso makes the revealing admission that,> “The vast majority of studies have focused on fungal outgrowth when the host> is compromised, with little known about the dynamics of the mycobiome during> health.”The ‘mycobiome’, which is different from the ‘microbiome’, refers to the normalcommunity of fungi that live in the human body.The previous section discussed how injected antibiotics cause the body to‘supercharge’ the endocrine system and that this leaves the body in a weakenedstate; it also discussed how ingested antibiotics affect the digestive system.All antibiotics therefore make the body more susceptible to increased celldamage from their toxic effects; this would readily explain the increasedpresence of Candida after many courses of antibiotics.The presence in the human body of fungi needs to be recognised as normal; theirrole should be regarded as providing assistance in the body’s normal processesof decomposition of dead cells and other detritus, and their removal from thebody.The ability of ‘science’ to develop a better understanding of the role andfunctions of fungi is hampered by the same obstacles that exist for bacteria andviruses; which is the medical establishment dogma that they are mostlypathogenic and need to be killed with toxic treatments.ProtozoaThe establishment definition of protozoa refers to,> “a group of microscopic single-celled organisms.”It adds the statement that,> “Most protozoa are free-living but some are important disease-causing> parasites of humans…”The three examples listed by the definition are Plasmodium, Leishmania andTrypanosoma, which are said to be the causal agents of malaria, leishmaniasisand trypanosomiasis, respectively.The term ‘protozoa’ is derived from the Greek words for ‘first’ and ‘animal’. DrLynn Margulis, however, refutes this terminology and states that they cannot bereferred to as ‘animals’ because,> “All animals and all plants develop from embryos, which are by definition> multicellular.”Dr Margulis asserts that living organisms should be classified into fivekingdoms, one of which she names ‘protoctists’. Her reason for this separateclassification is because these organisms are different from those belonging tothe other four kingdoms, which refer to animals, plants, fungi and bacteria.Scientific investigations have continued to discover the wide variety of‘microbiota’ that normally inhabit the human body; a July 2011 article entitledMicrobial Eukaryotes in the Human Microbiome: Ecology, Evolution and FutureDirections states that,> “Microbial eukaryotes are an important component of the human gut microbiome.”The article refers specifically to microbes that are normal residents of thehuman digestive system, which is the main focus of the study. The digestivesystem is not, however, the only part of the body in which microbes reside.Although the article discusses the role of bacteria and fungi, it also refers toother microorganisms that are called protists, which are part of the categorythat Dr Margulis refers to as protoctists. The article makes the interestingstatement that,> “While intestinal protistan parasites are often considered a tropical malady,> they are actually broadly distributed across the globe, and their prevalence> within a population is often linked to poor sanitation of human waste.”Yet again the problem of poor sanitation is associated with poor health; this isno ‘coincidence’. There is no need to invoke the existence of ‘germs’ tounderstand that living in close proximity to human and animal waste matter isextremely unhealthy. The presence of bacteria and fungi in waste matter is dueto their functions as saprotrophs; this is, after all, the reason that bacteriaare utilised in sewage treatment plants.The revelation that these ‘parasites’ occur throughout the globe, withoutnecessarily causing disease, is highlighted by another significant statement inthe article, which is that,> “…many people infected with known parasites...are asymptomatic.”Clearly, if people have no symptoms, they cannot be regarded as ill, which meansthat they cannot have been ‘infected’ by a pathogen, which, by definition, isthe causal agent of disease. These inconsistencies require a further examinationof the diseases these ‘parasites’ are alleged to cause.Malaria is regarded as one of the greatest killer diseases, especially in‘developing’ countries; but there is a growing body of evidence that refutes thefundamental claim that it is caused by the ‘parasite’ known as Plasmodium.The subject of malaria is discussed in detail in chapter eight, but some of theevidence that serves to deny its parasitic cause indicates that malaria isanother condition that often occurs as the result of unhealthy livingconditions. This evidence is indicated by Herbert Shelton with reference to thework of Dr M L Johnson PhD, who wrote an article for the periodical New Biologythat was published during the mid-20th century. Dr Johnson is quoted as havingwritten that,> “Where social conditions have been improved, malaria has gradually receded> before any special measures have been taken to conquer it.”In addition to the claim by the medical establishment that people who live in‘malaria endemic’ areas of the world are most at risk from contracting thedisease is a further, but totally contradictory claim; this latter claim isdemonstrated by the WHO January 2016 position paper on the subject of a malariavaccine that states,> “Adults who have lived in areas with high malaria transmission since childhood> and remain resident in such areas are generally not at risk of death from> malaria.”This statement indicates that people can be ‘immune’ to malaria; yet itcompletely contradicts the claim that malaria is a highly dangerous disease. Theonly reason for promoting the idea that people can become immune to malaria,which is otherwise regarded as ‘deadly’, would be to justify the introduction ofa vaccine. Both views are, however, incorrect as will be demonstrated in chaptereight.The Leishmania parasite is regarded as the cause of leishmaniasis, which is saidto have three forms. The parasite is said to be transmitted by sandflies to thehuman body, where it invades the cells of the lymphatic system, spleen and bonemarrow and causes disease. The functions of the lymphatic system include theelimination from the body of toxins and other waste matter; which stronglyindicates that this condition has a toxic rather than parasitic cause. Thetreatment of leishmaniasis includes drugs that contain antimony, which is highlytoxic and therefore exacerbates the condition.The March 2019 WHO fact sheet entitled Leishmaniasis refers to the ‘riskfactors’ for the disease and states,> “Poor housing and domestic sanitary conditions (such as a lack of waste> management or open sewerage) may increase sandfly breeding and resting> sites...”The use of the word ‘may’ indicates that it has not been proven that theseconditions induce sandflies to select them for their breeding and resting sites.Sandflies, like mosquitoes, are blood-suckers, which indicates the reason fortheir presence in close proximity to humans or other animals; but this does notprove that sandflies transmit ‘disease’. Furthermore, under the heading Keyfacts, the fact sheet makes the increasingly common claim that,> “Only a small fraction of those infected by Leishmania parasites will> eventually develop the disease.”However, one of the forms of the disease, which is called kala-azar, is claimedto be fatal if left untreated; a situation that contrasts starkly with the ideathat the majority of ‘infections’ will not result in the disease. Theinconsistencies within these claims make it clear that the ‘parasite’ cannot bethe cause of any illness; the insanitary living conditions, as well as otherfactors, invariably play a far more significant role.Trypanosoma is another parasite that is said to cause various diseases, one ofwhich is called trypanosomiasis. The April 2019 WHO fact sheet entitledTrypanosomiasis, human African (sleeping sickness) states that it is transmittedby tsetse flies, but also that,> “For reasons that are so far unexplained, in many regions where tsetse flies> are found, sleeping sickness is not.”The obvious explanation for this anomaly is that tsetse flies do not transmitthe parasite or the disease; the fact sheet also claims that,> “Without treatment, sleeping sickness is considered fatal although cases of> healthy carriers have been reported.”The existence of ‘healthy carriers’ demonstrates that the alleged ‘parasite’cannot be the cause of this disease. In Natural Hygiene: Man’s Pristine Way ofLife, Herbert Shelton discusses ‘septic infection’; it must be noted that hisuse of the term ‘sepsis’ refers to ‘poisoning’ not to ‘infection’. In hisdiscussion, he states that ‘poisoning’ is capable of causing sleeping sickness.The claim that protozoa are parasites that are the cause of deadly diseases isclearly unfounded.There is overwhelming evidence that thoroughly refutes the claims that theseillnesses are caused by ‘parasites’; insanitary living conditions together withother factors have a far more profound effect; as the discussions in chaptereight will demonstrate.WormsThe term used for a ‘parasitic worm’ is ‘helminth’, the establishment definitionof which is,> “any of the various parasitic worms, including the flukes, tapeworms and> nematodes.”This has given rise to the label ‘helminthiasis’, the establishment definitionof which refers to,> “the diseased condition resulting from an infestation with parasitic worms> (helminths).”Worms are the exception referred to in the discussion about other ‘germs’. Thereare some types of worm that can and do enter the human body, and these areinvariably of the kind that are visible to the naked eye, and are therefore notmicroorganisms. Their presence usually, although not exclusively, occurs in thedigestive system; but this only occurs under certain circumstances.As indicated by the definition, the medical establishment claims that it is an‘infestation’ that causes the disease, but this is not the case; in reality, itis a diseased condition that precedes an infestation of worms.The idea that the ‘diseased’ condition precedes the presence of worms in thedigestive system is explained by Herbert Shelton in Orthopathy, in which hecites the words of Dr John Tilden MD, who states that,> “It should not be forgotten that parasites will not find lodgement in the> intestinal tract of normally healthy people.”Herbert Shelton adds his own comment that,> “Tapeworm and hookworm cannot develop in a normal stomach and bowels.”By ‘normal’ he means a ‘healthy’ digestive system; in other words, one that hasnot been overloaded with a variety of ‘toxic’ materials.In Natural Hygiene: Man’s Pristine Way of Life, Herbert Shelton states that theworms that inhabit the digestive system feed on what he refers to as ‘morbidmaterials’; which is a clear indication of the importance of diet in matters ofhealth.It is recognised that the functions of earthworms include the decomposition ofdead material, but the only references to the functions of other worms describethem as ‘parasitic’ and pathogenic’; this is an area that requires furtherscientific investigation.The treatments for ‘helminthiasis’ include ‘albendazole’, which is recommendedby the WHO, as indicated in the March 2019 fact sheet entitled Soil-transmittedhelminth infections. It is interesting to note that some of the common ‘sideeffects’ of this drug include nausea, abdominal pains and headaches; all ofwhich are indicative of the toxic nature of the ‘treatment’, which will onlyincrease the toxic load of the body and the likelihood of further infestationsof worms.Immunity and AntibodiesThe previous discussions in this chapter have exposed the serious flaws in theideas and assumptions on which the ‘germ theory’ has been based. In addition tothe lack of any original scientific basis for the ‘theory’, is the overwhelmingevidence to support the assertion that no disease is caused by anymicroorganism.The inevitable conclusion to be drawn from this is that the ‘germ theory’ isfatally flawed; it must therefore be regarded as having been thoroughly refuted.But this refutation raises a number of questions about other aspects of thetheory, the main one of which relates to the existence and functions of the‘immune system’, the establishment definition of which refers to,> “the organs responsible for immunity.”The establishment definition of immunity refers to,> “the body’s ability to resist infection, afforded by the presence of> circulating antibodies and white blood cells.”The concept of ‘immunity’ is therefore inextricably interconnected to the ideathat external entities invade and infect the body thereby causing disease; butthe refutation of the ‘germ theory’ means that diseases cannot be the result of‘infections’. This, in turn, means that the entire concept of ‘immunity’ needsto be re-examined from a completely different perspective.The definition of immunity refers to the presence of antibodies, theestablishment definition of which refers to,> “a special kind of blood protein that is synthesized in lymphoid tissue in> response to the presence of a particular antigen and circulates in the plasma> to attack the antigen and render it harmless.”An antigen is defined by the establishment as,> “any substance that may be specifically bound by an antibody molecule.”It is clear therefore, that antibodies and antigens are interdependent‘entities’; but these definitions do not explain the processes involved.Antigens are also defined by the Medical Encyclopedia on the NIH website; thisdefinition provides some examples and states that,> “An antigen may be a substance from the environment, such as chemicals,> bacteria, viruses, or pollen.”The definition of an antibody states that it is produced in response to thepresence of antigens; it also states that antibodies attack antigens, whichinclude pathogens. This definition suggests therefore, that the human body is apermanent battleground of antibodies, pathogens and antigens.Nothing could be further from the truth.It is alleged that during an ‘infection’, the body produces a specific ‘antibodyresponse’ within the immune system to the pathogen. Once the antibody has beenproduced, it is said to remain in the body to recognise and to provideprotection against any future ‘infection’ by that pathogen. It is also claimedthat the existence of the appropriate antibodies provides ‘proof’ of a priorinfection, and that they can be detected by means of certain antibody tests.The discussion about viruses indicated that many people are diagnosed with aninfectious disease, such as a cold, without any tests having been conducted todetermine the nature of the alleged ‘infection’ or identify the causal agent.It is abundantly clear that there are many problems with these ideas, not leastof which is the fact that tests do not detect the actual microorganism; instead,they only detect ‘antibodies’, which are proteins, not living organisms.Another major problem is that most of the microorganisms claimed to bepathogenic are endogenous; they are normal components of the human microbiota.This therefore raises the question of why the body would produce ‘antibodies’with the specific purpose of attacking endogenous microorganisms; in otherwords, why would the body seek to attack its normal inhabitants, which are partof itself?Although there is no explanation for this phenomenon, the medical establishmenthas generated another adaptation of the ‘germ theory’ that introduces the ideathat the body can, and indeed does, attack itself. This idea is claimed toprovide an ‘explanation’ for a category of diseases referred to as ‘autoimmunediseases’, a number of which are discussed in chapter seven. The inclusion ofpollen as one of the many types of antigen introduces the notion that the immunesystem is implicated in ‘allergies’, which are also discussed in chapter seven.The refutation of the ‘germ theory’ means that there is no need for the body toprotect itself against any ‘pathogens’; this therefore requires a furtherdiscussion about the concept of ‘immunity’, which is claimed to exist in twoforms, referred to as ‘natural immunity’ and ‘acquired immunity’.The medical establishment claims that ‘natural immunity’ is passed duringpregnancy from a mother to her baby. It is also claimed that babies retain acertain level of immunity after birth whilst their own immune system develops.However, despite these claims, newborn infants are the primary targets of thevaccine industry on the basis that they need to be ‘protected’ from the largenumber of so-called ‘infectious diseases’ to which they could succumb.The other form of immunity, called ‘acquired immunity’, is claimed to beconferred through vaccination; the discussions in chapter two demonstrate thatvaccines confer no immunity whatsoever.In addition to the natural immunity passed by mother to baby during pregnancy,is the immunity passed during breast-feeding. This is recognised by a 1998article on the website of the NIH, entitled Breastfeeding provides passive andlikely long-lasting active immunity; the title is self-explanatory.Nevertheless, there are no exemptions from the vaccination schedule forbreastfed babies; a situation that is highly anomalous, although unsurprising.It is clear that the medical establishment disregards important aspects ofscientifically-established facts that contradict their core message, which isthat vaccines and drugs are essential to prevent and treat disease.There are many contradictions that arise as the result of the poor level ofunderstanding the medical establishment possesses about many of the functions ofthe human body; this includes a poor level of knowledge about the immune system.This can be demonstrated by a 2011 article entitled The Bodyguard: Tapping theImmune System’s Secrets, published on the website of Stanford Medicine. Thearticle refers to Dr Garrison Fathman MD, a professor of immunology, and statesthat he regards the immune system as a ‘black box’, in the context that there isnot a great deal of knowledge about its internal ‘workings’. This is anastounding admission considering the strenuous efforts of the medicalestablishment to promote the idea that the immune system protects people from‘infectious diseases’.The article also reports that, if asked by a patient about the state of theirimmune system, Dr Fathman is quoted to have stated that he would have difficultyin responding,> “I would have no idea how to answer that, and I’m an immunologist. None of us> can answer that.”Dr Fathman is also reported to have made the additional comment that,> “Right now we’re still doing the same tests I did when I was a medical student> in the late 1960s.”This is an astonishing admission of the lack of ‘progress’ that has been made inthe field of immunology, especially in view of the discoveries about the humanmicrobiota made during the past few decades. The compartmentalisation ofdifferent scientific disciplines contributes substantially to the lack ofprogress towards a better understanding of the intact living organism that isthe human body.The article refers to the immune system as ‘staggeringly complex’; which furtherindicates the poor level of understanding about ‘immunity’ and the immunesystem. The article also quotes the words of Dr Mark Davis, director of theInstitute for Immunology, Transplantation and Infection, who, with reference tothe immune system, states,> “That’s an awful lot of moving parts. And we don’t really know what the vast> majority of them do, or should be doing.”And in yet another astonishing admission, Dr Davis is quoted to have statedthat,> “We can’t even be sure how to tell when the immune system’s not working right,> let alone why not, because we don’t have good metrics of what a healthy human> immune system looks like.”In the absence of a good level of understanding of a healthy immune system, themedical establishment is in no position to make authoritative assertions aboutits function in ‘disease’.The fact that microorganisms are neither invaders of the body nor the causes ofdisease means that the body cannot have a distinct ‘system’, the function ofwhich is solely to produce antibodies to attack alleged invaders. The proteinscalled antibodies may have specific roles in the body, but whilst they arebelieved to be part of the body’s defensive ‘army’, their real function, orfunctions, will remain a mystery.The lack of any genuine basis for the theories about ‘immunity to disease’ ishighlighted by Herbert Shelton, who states succinctly that,> “It is not enough to say that those ‘exposed’ individuals who failed to> develop allegedly infectious disease are immune. This merely says that they do> not develop the disease because they do not develop it. It explains nothing.”However, there is one meaning of the word ‘immunity’ that is relevant to health,because it is certainly possible to be ‘immune’ to illness. The ordinarydictionary definition of the word ‘immune’ refers to ‘being unaffected bysomething’, and it is this meaning that is incorporated into a statement made byDr John Tilden,> “Can one person become immune and another not? The dilemma appears to be fully> settled when it is understood that health--full health--is the only reliable> opposition to disease; that everything which improves health builds immunity> to all disease-building influences…”Chapter ten discusses the variety of ways in which people can build this kind of‘immunity’ to illness by creating ‘health’ in their body.The discussion in this chapter provides a thorough refutation of the ‘germtheory’; but this will inevitably raise further questions, especially about themany ‘infectious diseases’ that are said to have afflicted mankind forcenturies, and about the real causes of these diseases if they cannot beattributed to ‘germs’. These questions are discussed in the next chapter withreference to a number of ‘infectious diseases’."},{"pageContent":"> 4. ‘Infectious’ Diseases: Dispelling the Myths> “The practice of poisoning a person because he is ill is based on erroneous> notions of the essential nature of disease.” Herbert Shelton The medical establishment claims that there are two types of disease, infectiousand non-infectious; those of the latter type, which are also known asnoncommunicable diseases, are discussed in chapter seven.Infectious diseases, also called communicable diseases, are said to possess twodefining features that differentiate them from ‘non-infectious’ diseases. Thefirst is that they are claimed to be caused by ‘pathogens’, as indicated by theWHO web page entitled Infectious diseases which states that,> “Infectious diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms, such as> bacteria, viruses, parasites or fungi…”The second feature is that they are claimed to be transmissible between people,as indicated by the establishment definition of ‘communicable disease’ thatrefers to,> “any disease that can be transmitted from one person to another.”It is clear that these features are inextricably interconnected. The claim thatinfectious diseases are transmitted between people is totally dependent on theclaim that they are caused by pathogenic microorganisms. It is these‘microorganisms’ that are claimed to be the ‘infectious agents’ that are spread,both directly and indirectly, between people, who become ‘infected’ with the‘pathogen’ and develop the disease they are alleged to cause. However, asrevealed in the previous chapter, the claim that microorganisms are pathogenicis erroneous; the claim that diseases are transmissible between people istherefore equally erroneous.The logical conclusion to be drawn from this is that the term ‘infectiousdisease’ is a misnomer, because, in reality, there is no such phenomenon as an‘infectious disease’.The assertion that no diseases are ‘infectious’ will inevitably be consideredhighly controversial, because it contradicts information promulgated by themedical establishment about ‘infectious diseases’; but its controversial naturedoes not deny its veracity.One of the main reasons that this assertion will be considered controversial isbecause it conflicts with a common experience, which is that diseases appear tobehave as if they are infectious. It is therefore appropriate to quote the maximthat ‘appearances can be deceptive’; the appearance of infectiousness is indeeddeceptive. It is not unusual for people to be ill at the same time and to havethe same or very similar symptoms; this is often assumed to mean that they havethe same disease that has been ‘spread’ by some kind of ‘germ’. Although it isnot surprising that the overwhelming majority of people make this assumption, itis nevertheless an entirely erroneous one.Within all forms of research, it is the evidence that is primary; this meansthat if a prevailing theory fails to adequately explain empirical evidence, itis the theory that requires reassessment. Prevailing theories may even need tobe totally abandoned, especially when other theories exist that offer morecompelling and comprehensive explanations for the available evidence. Theincreasing efforts to achieve ‘consensus’ within the field of ‘medicine’ haveensured that certain theories, especially the ‘germ theory’, form the‘consensus’ view; but this is entirely inappropriate as it hampers researchersfrom formulating more compelling theories that better explain the evidence. Thepurpose of research is encapsulated by a statement attributed to Dr AlbertSzent-Györgyi PhD,> “Research is to see what everyone else has seen and to think what nobody else> has thought.”Dr Peter Duesberg echoes this sentiment in his comment that,> “Many pivotal contributions to science throughout history have consisted less> of new observations than of new explanations for old data.”Although the medical establishment continues to make ‘new observations’ fromlaboratory experimentation, it fails entirely to provide plausible explanationsfor certain ‘old data’; especially data about ‘infectious diseases’. There isclearly a consensus view with respect to these diseases, but that does not meanit is a correct view.One of the reasons for the perpetuation of the fallacy that ‘germs’ cause‘infectious diseases’ is to support the pharmaceutical industry, which is a keymember of the medical establishment, and to promote the need for medicines andvaccines to combat these diseases. However, despite the seemingly best effortsof the industry, modern medicine has been unable to contain ‘infectiousdiseases’, which are reported to be proliferating; as indicated by a July 2013article entitled Emerging Infectious Diseases: Threats to Human Health andGlobal Stability which states that,> “Today, however, despite extraordinary advances in development of counter> measures (diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines), the ease of world travel> and increased global interdependence have added layers of complexity to> containing these infectious diseases that affect not only the health but the> economic stability of societies.”The idea that infectious diseases can threaten ‘economic stability’ is based onthe notion that ill people are not productive members of society; the problemswith this idea and its global implications are discussed in chapters eight andnine.Although the article refers to ‘extraordinary advances’ in the measures employedto contain infectious diseases, it fails to explain the distinct lack of successthese measures have had in achieving their objective. The reference to ‘layersof complexity’ is wholly inadequate as an explanation for the failure ofmedicines and vaccines to be effective against infectious diseases. The realreason they are ineffective is because diseases are not caused by germs; theycannot be treated with toxic medicines or prevented by toxic vaccines. The manyand very real threats to human health are discussed in chapter six.The article states that infectious diseases have been emerging and re-emergingfor millennia and that the emergence of new infectious diseases is inevitable.In addition, it suggests that the vast majority of new infections are ‘likely’to have originated in animals, particularly rodents and bats; the use of theword ‘likely’ indicates that this idea remains unproven. The idea that animalsharbour ‘germs’ that can be spread to humans is unfounded, as demonstrated bythe discussions in the previous chapter. A number of animal diseases arediscussed in the next chapter to demonstrate that they are also not caused bypathogens.The article does however, acknowledge that the emergence and re-emergence ofso-called ‘infectious diseases’ are driven by numerous factors, which include:technology and industry; poverty and social inequality; war and famine. Many ofthese factors are certainly relevant to health, or rather to ill-health, but thearticle relegates them to being of lesser significance than ‘germs’, which areclaimed to pose the greatest threat.The fact that ‘infectious diseases’ are not caused by ‘germs’ and are nottransmissible, inevitably raises questions about the real nature of theillnesses referred to as ‘infectious’, and about their ability to appear tosimultaneously affect large numbers of people with very similar symptoms.The definition of each individual infectious disease lists a number of differentsymptoms that a person ‘may’ experience when they are deemed to have that‘disease’. However, because many symptoms are common to a number of diseases, a‘correct’ diagnosis may require people to undergo additional tests that areclaimed to be able to identify the pathogen, and therefore the disease. The mostcommon types of test involve the examination of blood or urine samples; but, aspreviously stated, such tests do not detect the actual ‘pathogen’; instead, theydetect proteins, referred to as ‘antibodies’, that will help to identify thepathogen responsible for the infection, because each antibody is specific toeach type of ‘germ’.Yet the medical establishment interprets the presence of antibodies in the bodyin two entirely different ways. One interpretation is that the production ofantibodies claimed to be specific to a pathogen, indicates that the person hasimmunity to the disease it is said to cause. The other interpretation is thatthe presence of antibodies means that the person has been ‘infected’ by apathogen and has the disease it is said to cause. These interpretations aremutually exclusive; nevertheless, they are both promulgated by the medicalestablishment as ‘information’ about infectious diseases, antibodies andimmunity. It should be obvious, however, that neither interpretation is correct.It is claimed that ‘infectious diseases’ are collectively responsible for theloss each year of many millions of lives and that these numbers are sporadicallyaugmented by a virulent ‘outbreak’ of disease. Some of the most frequently cited‘deadly outbreaks’ are the Black Death, the 1918 Flu and HIV/AIDS, all of whichare discussed in this chapter.The situation in which very large numbers of people become ill and suffer verysimilar symptoms is usually referred to as an ‘epidemic’, which Herbert Sheltondescribes as ‘mass sickness’ and explains that,> “In all epidemics, the so-called epidemic disease is but one among several> symptom complexes presented by the sick.”Although it may appear that people display the same symptoms, it is rare thateveryone will experience exactly the same set of symptoms with exactly the sameintensity and for exactly the same duration. It is clear therefore, that peopleonly ever experience varying ‘symptom complexes’.There are reasons that large numbers of people may be ill at the same time anddisplay similar symptoms, as will be explained in the discussions in thischapter; but these reasons do not include infections with ‘germs’ that have beentransmitted between people.The refusal to recognise the fundamentally flawed nature of the ‘germ theory’continues to present a serious obstacle to the implementation of genuinesolutions to the many real threats to human health. This situation will continueto worsen whilst the medical establishment remains intransigent and continues toperpetuate flawed theories, especially through medical training. Althoughpreviously cited, Dr Carolyn Dean’s statement is again pertinent and deservesrepetition,> “In fact, we were told many times that if we didn’t learn it in medical school> it must be quackery.”It is this arrogant attitude that prevents progress towards the achievement of abetter understanding about human health and illness; but the failings of themedical establishment do not invalidate other research studies andinvestigations that present far more compelling explanations of a number ofso-called ‘infectious’ diseases; as the following discussions will demonstrate.SmallpoxSmallpox has been previously discussed at some length; the reason for returningto this disease is to dispel the popular belief that claims smallpox to havebeen responsible for the devastating loss of life suffered by the indigenouspeoples of America, because it was ‘carried’ there by Europeans. Variations ofthis story also refer to other diseases carried to the New World by the Spanishinitially and later by the Portuguese and the British. These diseases includemeasles, influenza, bubonic plague, diphtheria, typhus, cholera, scarlet fever,chicken pox, yellow fever and whooping cough; it is commonly asserted, however,that smallpox was responsible for the greatest loss of life.Within this ‘myth’ are a number of interrelated assertions, one of which is thatnone of these diseases had previously existed in the New World. Another is that,because these diseases were ‘new’ to them, the indigenous people had no immunityand were therefore unable to offer resistance to ‘infection’ with the germscarried by the Europeans. The inevitable conclusion, according to the myth, isthat millions of people became ‘infected’ and therefore succumbed to, and evendied from, the diseases the germs are alleged to cause.However, yet again, nothing could be further from the truth.Although the main reason this myth is false is because it is based on thefatally flawed ‘germ theory’, its assertions can also be shown to be in directcontradiction of a number of the claims made by the medical establishment about‘infectious’ diseases.One of these contradictions arises because few of the diseases alleged to havebeen ‘carried’ to the New World are regarded as inherently fatal, but they areclaimed to have caused millions of deaths. Yet, if these diseases were so deadlyto the indigenous peoples, how were any of them able to survive; as thereclearly were survivors.It is claimed that the crews of the ships that arrived in the New World spreadtheir diseases easily because they are highly contagious. It is also claimedthat these sailors remained unaffected by the germs they ‘carried’ throughoutthe long voyages across the Atlantic Ocean. Although some people are claimed tobe ‘asymptomatic carriers’, it is highly improbable, if not impossible, thatevery crew member of every ship that sailed to the New World would have merelycarried the ‘germs’ without succumbing to the diseases.The most common explanation offered for the failure of the crews to succumb tothese diseases is that they had developed immunity to them; but this explanationis highly problematic. According to the medical establishment, a healthy,competent immune system is one that contains antibodies that will destroypathogens. Therefore, if the European sailors were ‘immune’ to all thesediseases due to the presence of the appropriate antibodies, their bodies wouldnot contain any ‘germs’. If, on the other hand, the European sailors did carry‘germs’ they could not have been ‘immune’.It is not the purpose of this discussion to deny that millions of people died,but to refute the claim that they died from ‘infectious diseases’, especiallysmallpox, because they had no ‘immunity’ to the ‘germs’ transmitted to them byEuropeans. This refutation means therefore, that they must have died from othercauses.Fortunately, historical research has uncovered evidence of the existence of anumber of causal factors that would have contributed to the devastating loss oflife in the New World after 1492. One source of research is the work ofhistorian Dr David Stannard PhD, who studied contemporary writings during hisinvestigation of the history of the discovery of the New World. This research isdocumented in his book entitled American Holocaust: The Conquest of the NewWorld, in which he reveals many pertinent factors, not least of which relates tothe conditions in which most Spanish people lived during the period prior to thefirst voyages to the New World; he explains,> “Roadside ditches, filled with stagnant water, served as public latrines in> the cities of the fifteenth century, and they would continue to do so for> centuries to follow.”These conditions are strikingly similar to those that prevailed in many Europeancountries during the same period. The majority of the people lived withoutsanitation or sewers; they lived with their own waste and sewage. Those wholived in towns and cities had limited, if any, access to clean water, whichmeant that they drank polluted water and rarely washed themselves. The majorityof the populations of these countries were also extremely poor and had little toeat. In his book, Dr Stannard quotes the words of J H Elliott, who states,> “The rich ate, and ate to excess watched by a thousand hungry eyes as they> consumed their gargantuan meals. The rest of the population starved.”Insufficient food that leads to starvation is certainly a factor thatcontributes to poor health, but eating to excess can also be harmful to health;which means that the rich would not have been strangers to illness either. It isnot merely the quantity of food, whether too little or too much, that is theproblem; of far greater significance to health is the quality of the foodconsumed.The conditions in which the native populations of the New World lived were, bycomparison, strikingly different; as Dr Stannard relates,> “And while European cities then, and for centuries thereafter, took their> drinking water from the fetid and polluted rivers nearby, Tenochtitlan’s> drinking water came from springs deep within the mainland and was piped into> the city by a huge aqueduct system that amazed Cortes and his men – just as> they were astonished also by the personal cleanliness and hygiene of the> colourfully dressed populace, and by their extravagant (to the Spanish) use of> soaps, deodorants and breath sweeteners.”One of the most significant contributions to the substantial reduction inmorbidity and mortality from disease, especially smallpox, in Europe was theimplementation of sanitary reforms. It is therefore wholly inappropriate toclaim that people who lived in such clean and hygienic conditions would havebeen more susceptible to disease. In reality, the people who lived in such cleanand hygienic conditions would have been far healthier than any of the colonists,all of whom lived in countries where most people lived in squalid conditions,amidst filth and sewage and rarely, if ever, bathed.The original objective of the first voyage led by the Italian, ChristopherColumbus, is said to have been to find a western route to Asia; however, themain purpose of the voyages to new lands was to seek and obtain valuableresources, such as gold and silver. When the conquistadors observed the goldenjewellery worn by indigenous peoples, they assumed that the land was rich withsuch treasures and this resulted in atrocious behaviour, as Dr Stannarddescribes,> “The troops went wild, stealing, killing, raping and torturing natives, trying> to force them to divulge the whereabouts of the imagined treasure-houses of> gold.”Using these methods, the Spanish ‘acquired’ the gold and jewellery they desired,but when no more could be collected directly from the people, they proceeded toutilise other methods. One of these methods was to establish mines, using thelocal population as the work force, to extract the precious metals from theground. In addition to being forced to work, the indigenous peoples enduredappalling conditions within the mines, as Dr Stannard explains,> “There, in addition to the dangers of falling rocks, poor ventilation and the> violence of brutal overseers, as the Indian labourers chipped away at the rock> faces of the mines they released and inhaled the poisonous vapours of> cinnabar, arsenic, arsenic anhydride and mercury.”To add insult to injury, the lives of the Indians were viewed by the Spanishpurely in commercial terms, as Dr Stannard again relates,> “For as long as there appeared to be an unending supply of brute labor it was> cheaper to work an Indian to death, and then replace him or her with another> native, than it was to feed and care for either of them properly.”Mining was not the only type of work they were forced to perform; plantationswere also established, with the local population again comprising the totallabour force. The appalling conditions and the violence they suffered led totheir lives being substantially shortened; as Dr Stannard further relates,> “It is probable, in fact, that the life expectancy of an Indian engaged in> forced labor in a mine or on a plantation during those early years of Spanish> terror in Peru was not much more than three or four months...”The number of deaths that resulted from such brutal work and treatment isunknown, but clearly substantial, as indicated by author Eduardo Galeano, whodescribes in his book entitled Open Veins of Latin America, that,> “The Caribbean island populations finally stopped paying tribute because they> had disappeared; they were totally exterminated in the gold mines...”It is hardly surprising that so many died in the gold mines considering theconditions they were made to endure; these included exposures to many highlytoxic substances, as described above.There was a further and even more tragic reason that many people died, but thisdid not involve brutal work and appalling working conditions. It is reportedthat some of the native people refused to be enslaved and forced to work;instead they took their fate into their own hands, the tragic consequences ofwhich are explained by the words of Fernandez de Oviedo as quoted by EduardoGaleano in Open Veins,> “Many of them, by way of diversion took poison rather than work, and others> hanged themselves with their own hands.”The number of people who died this way is also unknown, because these eventswere mostly unrecorded. Dr Stannard writes that there was a considerable levelof resistance by the native people that often led directly to their deaths atthe hands of the conquistadors, but the number of people who died this way isalso unknown.Dr Stannard states that ‘diseases’ were also a factor that caused the deaths ofmany of the indigenous people. Unfortunately, in this claim, like theoverwhelming majority of people, he has clearly accepted the medicalestablishment claims about infectious disease. Although this reference todiseases must be disregarded, Dr Stannard’s research is otherwise based ondocumented evidence; for example, he refers to eyewitness accounts written bypeople such as Bartolomé de Las Casas about the atrocities that devastated thenative population. Dr Stannard also refers to documented reports, which statethat many tens of thousands of indigenous people were directly and deliberatelykilled; he refers to these as massacres and slaughters.Dr Stannard records that many native people attempted to retaliate but wereinvariably unable to overpower the conquistadors who had superior weapons; manyof them died as the result of these battles. Others chose not to fight butinstead attempted to escape, the result of which was that,> “Crops were left to rot in the fields as the Indians attempted to escape the> frenzy of the conquistadors’ attacks.”Starvation would no doubt have accounted for many more deaths.The enormous scale of the loss of life can be illustrated by statistics thatrelate to the indigenous population of Hispaniola, which Dr Stannard reports tohave plummeted from 8 million to virtually zero between the years 1496 to 1535.He indicates that this devastation in Hispaniola was not unique; but representsa typical example of the almost total annihilation of the indigenous populationsthat occurred throughout the land now known as America.The Spanish were not the only ‘conquerors’ of the New World; the Portugueseestablished themselves in Brazil soon after the Spanish had arrived inHispaniola. The consequences for the indigenous population of Brazil were,however, virtually the same as those for Hispaniola, as Dr Stannard records,> “Within just twenty years...the native peoples of Brazil already were well> along the road to extinction.”The arrival of British settlers, beginning in 1607, saw no reprieve for theindigenous peoples; although the confrontations were initially of a more‘military’ nature; Dr Stannard relates that,> “Starvation and the massacre of non-combatants was becoming the preferred> British approach to dealing with the natives.”The medical establishment has a clear vested interest in perpetuating the myththat it was the ‘germs’ that killed many millions of people who had no immunityto the diseases the germs are alleged to cause.Unfortunately, this myth has distorted history, as it has succeeded infurthering the ‘germ theory’ fallacy, and failed to bring to light the realcauses of the deaths of many millions of people; but, as the work of people likeDr David Stannard, Eduardo Galeano, and others, have shown, there is ampleevidence to support other and more compelling explanations for that enormousdeath toll, all of which may eventually succeed in overturning the myth.Childhood DiseasesThe medical establishment view with respect to ‘childhood diseases’ is indicatedby a 2008 article entitled Childhood Diseases – What Parents Need to Know, whichstates that,> “Children encounter many infectious diseases, especially in the early months> and years of life. Some upper respiratory viral or bacterial infections – such> as colds, bronchiolitis, or croup – are quite common and difficult to avoid.”The article does not explain why ‘infectious’ diseases are common nor why theymainly affect babies and young children; its main purpose is to advise parentsabout vaccines, which are claimed to be,> “…incredibly effective in preventing childhood diseases and improving child> mortality rates.”Although many childhood diseases are claimed to be ‘vaccine-preventable’, thereis one notable exception, namely the ‘common cold’, that continues to bafflemodern medicine. The alleged reason that no vaccine has been produced to combatthe common cold is due to the theory that it can be caused by more than 200different viruses.This clearly cannot be the case; however, the alleged existence of hundreds ofdifferent ‘viruses’ that can cause a cold raises the question of why theseviruses do not attack people simultaneously. The medical establishment theoryalleges that infections weaken the immune system and that this weakened statepermits ‘germs’ to take advantage and attack the body. This situation shouldmean that people would have many concurrent infections and diseases.The medical literature does refer to instances of concurrent infections, butthey are not considered to be commonplace; this is clearly another anomaly thatdefies the tenets of the ‘germ theory’, which claims that ‘germs’ may cause‘opportunistic infections’.One of the main reasons that babies are recommended to have vaccines is claimedto be because they are extremely vulnerable due to their immature immunesystems. If this were true, babies and small children would be far more prone toillness from multiple concurrent infections with ‘germs’, against which theyhave not been vaccinated, including the 200 or more cold viruses.This too is clearly not the case.The US immunisation schedule involves vaccines against fourteen diseases,because, according to the CDC web page entitled Vaccinate Your Baby for BestProtection,> “Diseases that vaccines prevent can be very serious – even deadly – especially> for infants and young children.”It is unnecessary to discuss all fourteen diseases, but they include chickenpox,measles and German measles (rubella), all of which are regarded as ‘viral’infections that particularly affect children. All three of these diseasesproduce very similar symptoms, the most common of which are a fever and a rash.It is claimed that the replication of a ‘virus’ in a cell causes cell death; yetthere is no explanation by the medical establishment for the mechanism by whichthe death of a cell is able to induce a fever or a skin rash, or any of theother symptoms of a so-called ‘viral’ disease.The medical establishment view of disease contains many flaws, one of whichrelates to the nature of symptoms; this is discussed in more detail in chapterten. Another flaw is the belief that the human body possesses no inherentmechanisms that affect health. These flaws have been exposed by various pioneerswho have been dissatisfied with the teachings of the medical establishmentsystem and have conducted their own investigations. For example, in chapter onereference was made to the experience of Dr John Tilden MD who changed hispractice from a drug-based one to a drugless one.One of the discoveries that has resulted from these investigations is that thebody does possess the ability to self-heal, which it performs through mechanismsthat expel and eliminate substances that are toxic and therefore injurious tothe body. One of those mechanisms utilises the skin, one of the major organs ofthe body. The elimination of toxins through the skin produces ‘eruptions’ thatmay be described as rashes, spots or pustules. The body’s efforts to eliminatetoxins may also involve a fever. These symptoms are, however, usuallyinterpreted, albeit erroneously, as ‘bad’ and to require medicine to suppressthem; but pharmaceutical drugs only increase the level of toxins in the body. Inhis book Impaired Health Vol 2, Dr Tilden explains the elimination processinvolved in measles,> “Measles is the manner in which a child’s body throws off toxemia.”Dr Tilden mainly refers to toxins resulting from poor eating habits. The diet ofmost children in the 21st century is very different from that of children whowere patients of Dr Tilden, who died in 1941. However, as will be discussed inchapter six, this does not mean that children’s diets in the 21st century arebetter than those of the mid-20th century; in many instances, they are farworse.Diet is clearly a significant factor as digestive problems are associated with avariety of ill-health conditions. Dr Tilden explains in his book that manydiseases often begin with,> “…a decided derangement of the gastrointestinal canal…”It is for this reason that a child with a fever and a rash will usually have noappetite; the digestive system needs to eliminate the accumulated toxins; afurther intake of food will only worsen the problem. Dr Robert Mendelsohn MDindicates in Confessions of a Medical Heretic that one of the main ‘problemfoods’ for young babies and small children is cow’s milk. He regards humanbreast-milk as the only suitable food for a baby and refers to bottle-feedingwith cow’s milk as,> “…the granddaddy of all junk food…”He expands on the health problems likely to arise for a baby that is not fedbreast milk,> “The bottle-fed human baby is substantially more likely to suffer a whole> nightmare of illnesses…”Foods are only one possible source of ‘toxins’; other sources include the‘medicines’ that are claimed to provide relief from the symptoms of disease andthe vaccines that are claimed to provide protection from disease.One of the major questions about childhood diseases relates to their apparentcontagiousness; many children seem to be simultaneously ill with the samedisease that appears to have been spread amongst them.The main problem is that this question relies on the fundamental assumption thatthere is a specific disease entity that the children have all ‘caught’; but thisis not the case. Like all people, children only ever experience different‘symptom complexes’, which are always the result of different factors that varyaccording to each child; they do not have the same disease, as will be discussedfurther in chapter ten.Simultaneous outbreaks of similar illnesses can occur as the result ofsimultaneous exposures to certain toxins. It should be noted that childrenundergo developmental stages at certain ages, and these may include efforts to‘clean’ the body that involve certain symptoms.Another cause of simultaneous outbreaks involves the simultaneous exposure tovaccines. Although it is only the serious reactions that are recorded, manychildren react to vaccine ingredients by producing rashes and fevers, both ofwhich are acknowledged to be the direct effects of vaccines. These symptoms caneasily be interpreted, albeit mistakenly, to be the result of an ‘infectious’disease.Despite their different labels, childhood diseases can all be explained as thevarious processes that are performed by the body in the attempt to expel‘toxins’ and self-heal; as Herbert Shelton explains,> “Childhood brings its peculiar diseases – the successive efforts of nature to> purify a depraved system.”Children’s bodies are, unfortunately, becoming increasingly ‘depraved’; a wordthat also means ‘polluted’. Many of the pollutants to which children areincreasingly exposed are discussed in chapter six; they include, but are notlimited to, the toxic chemical ingredients of processed food products, plusmedicines and vaccines, as well as the synthetic chemicals, such as plastics,used to manufacture products intended for use by babies and small children.LeprosyThe establishment definition of leprosy refers to it as,> “a chronic disease, caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae, that affects> the skin, mucous membranes, and nerves.”Leprosy is a disease that is said to have existed for many millennia; it isreported to be one of the diseases described in the writings of Hippocrates. Itis claimed that leprosy was rife during the Middle Ages; a period in whichdiseases were viewed in many parts of the world as supernatural in origin andthe result of curses or punishments from the gods.For a long period of time, leprosy was considered to be highly contagious; asituation that resulted in the segregation of people with the disease from themain population and their quarantine into separate living areas or lepercolonies. This situation has changed substantially; leper colonies no longerexist and the disease is now regarded as another ‘bacterial infection’, asindicated by the definition.In the late 19th century, when the ‘germ theory’ was gaining increasedpopularity, Dr Hansen of Norway identified a bacterium that he claimed to be thecausal agent of leprosy; a discovery that resulted in its alternative name,Hansen’s disease. Prior to this discovery, the treatment of leprosy involved theuse of a variety of strange and dangerous substances that are reported to haveincluded: blood, bee stings and arsenic. Another of the early ‘treatments’ forleprosy involved the use of mercury, the dangers of which are described by DrCarolyn Dean in Death by Modern Medicine,> “Mercury is second only to plutonium in toxicity. When it first began to be> used, centuries ago, nobody really knew its dangers. Mercury ointment was a> treatment for the skin lesions of leprosy, beginning in the 1300’s.”Dr Hansen’s ‘discovery’ resulted in the method of treatment for the disease tobe changed from mercury ointments to penicillin. The current treatment involvesmultiple antibiotics, as indicated by the March 2019 WHO fact sheet entitledLeprosy, which states that,> “Leprosy is curable with multidrug therapy (MDT).”MDT involves a combination of different antibiotics; the reason for this isincluded in the establishment definition of leprosy that states,> “Like tuberculosis, leprosy should be treated with a combination of> antibacterial drugs, to overcome the problem of resistance developing to a> single drug...”A November 2011 article entitled Advances and hurdles on the way towards aleprosy vaccine refers to a decline in the incidence of the disease, but statesthat this decline has ‘stalled’ with the suggestion that the drugs may not betotally effective against the disease. The reason that antibiotics may appear tohave a limited effectiveness is because of their debilitating effect on theendocrine glands, especially the adrenals, as previously discussed.The article attempts to address the issue of drug resistance and includes theinteresting revelation that,> “…the mechanism(s) underlying nerve injury in leprosy is very poorly> understood.”The article adds the interesting comment that,> “…BCG was originally developed and widely implemented for the control of both> leprosy and tuberculosis.”Tuberculosis and the BCG vaccine are discussed in more detail later in thischapter; however, it must be noted that TB and leprosy are claimed to be causedby different bacteria, which raises the question of how the vaccine for TB couldbe effective for leprosy; this question is not answered by the tenets of the‘germ theory’.The intention of the article is clearly to support the development of a leprosyvaccine on the basis that antibiotics are becoming ineffective and lead to‘resistance’; a situation that is claimed to have the potential to lead to thedevastating resurgence of the disease. The article makes yet another astonishingadmission which is that,> “Leprosy (or Hansen’s disease) is one of the most renowned, but least> understood diseases of man.”The article also highlights the flawed nature of the underlying theory relatingto infectious diseases in the revealing statement that,> “M. leprae infection does not always cause disease, and it is estimated that> anywhere between 30-75% of infections are spontaneously cleared without> causing significant symptoms.”This revelation demonstrates that M. leprae fails to meet the criteria of Koch’sfirst postulate, and provides unequivocal evidence that this bacterium cannot bethe cause of the condition called ‘leprosy’. Furthermore, M. leprae isrecognised to be a pleomorphic bacterium, which means that its morphology isvery likely to be dependent on the conditions of its environment.The most recognisable symptoms associated with leprosy are the disfiguring skineruptions, but the label of ‘leprosy’ was not always applied to a specific typeof skin problem, as Herbert Shelton explains,> “For ages the term leprosy was applied to a wide variety of skin diseases…”The previous discussion demonstrated that skin eruptions occur when the body isattempting to eliminate ‘toxins’, which can involve those arising fromunhygienic and insanitary living conditions. This point is highlighted by DrGerhard Buchwald in Vaccination: A Business Based in Fear, in which he providesdetails of the living conditions people endured when leprosy was a commonlydiagnosed disease,> “Leprosy was a constant guest in the times when increasing numbers of people> lived together in the most cramped spaces as the city walls made the expansion> of cities difficult. As soon as the cities grew beyond the city walls and> people had more space available, leprosy disappeared.”There is a very clear association between certain factors, especially insanitaryliving conditions, and an ‘eruptive’ disease. Herbert Shelton provides anotherdescription of the results of sanitary reforms and improved living conditions,> “Europe was once a hot bed of leprosy. Even as far west as England it was a> serious problem. It has practically disappeared from Europe and this has not> been due to any vaccine or serum drug that has wiped it out. The improved> social conditions — sanitation, diet, personal cleanliness, better housing,> and other healthful factors—that have evolved in Europe, with no aid from the> medical profession have eliminated this disease.”It is abundantly clear that unhygienic living conditions were major contributoryfactors for diseases such as smallpox and leprosy; it is equally clear that theimplementation of sanitation measures was a substantial contributory factor forthe reduction in morbidity and mortality due to these diseases.Skin eruptions, whether diagnosed as leprosy or smallpox, are manifestations ofthe body’s elimination processes, as explained by Dr Henry Bieler in Food isYour Best Medicine,> “In the same way, if the bile poisons in the blood come out through the skin,> we get the various irritations of the skin…”However, although skin eruptions can manifest as a variety of symptoms that areclaimed to indicate the presence of certain diseases, it is a mistake to regardthem as separate disease entities. The different kinds of lumps, bumps, spots,rashes and pustules are manifestations of the body’s efforts to expel toxinsthrough the skin.There is very little recognition within the mainstream medical literature of thesanitary reforms that substantially reduced the incidence of leprosy.Unfortunately, neither is there sufficient recognition within the medicalestablishment literature of one factor that has been shown to produce leprosy.Fortunately, there is adequate evidence from other sources; for example, EleanorMcBean explains in her book entitled Swine Flu Expose that,> “Many vaccines also cause other diseases besides the one for which they are> given. For instance, smallpox vaccine often causes syphilis, paralysis,> leprosy, and cancer.”The dangers of the smallpox vaccine have been discussed; although it issignificant that leprosy is identified as one of the possible ‘diseases’ it cancause. But this should not be surprising considering that vaccines contain avariety of toxic ingredients that require elimination from the body. Furtherevidence of the link between vaccines and leprosy is provided by William Tebb inhis book Leprosy and Vaccination,> “According to all the evidence which I have been able to obtain, leprosy was> unknown in the Sandwich Islands until many years after the advent of Europeans> and Americans, who introduced vaccination; and there is no aboriginal word in> the Hawaiian language for this disease.”Clearly, the symptoms diagnosed as leprosy had existed long before theintroduction of vaccines, but it is equally clear that vaccines contribute tomany health problems.Although the disease is considered to have greatly declined, it is not thoughtto have been eradicated; it is claimed to still exist in the parts of the worldthat are referred to as ‘developing’ countries, as will be discussed further inchapter eight.SyphilisThe establishment definition of syphilis refers to,> “a sexually transmitted disease caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum,> resulting in the formation of lesions throughout the body.”The word syphilis is reported to have originated in 1530 with the ItalianGirolamo Fracastoro, who was one of the early proponents of the idea that‘germs’ cause disease. His introduction of the word syphilis was initially in apoem, in which he used the word to refer to both a character and the diseasewith which the character was suffering. In the poem Fracastoro seems to be ofthe opinion that the illness was the result of a pollution of the atmosphere.The exact origin of the disease referred to as ‘syphilis’ is said to be unknown;although two hypotheses have been proposed. One hypothesis suggests thatsyphilis was ‘carried’ to Europe in the late 15th century by the Spanish, whohad been ‘infected’ in the New World and transmitted the disease on their returnto their native country. The other hypothesis suggests that it was not ‘new’,but had not been previously recognised.A December 2015 article entitled The Return of Syphilis, on the website of TheAtlantic, which will be referred to as the Atlantic article, refers to a quotefrom the book Guns, Germs and Steel, in which the author, scientist JaredDiamond, provides a description of the early form of syphilis,> “Its pustules often covered the body from head to the knees, caused flesh to> fall from people’s faces and led to death within a few months.”This description would seem to be more applicable to leprosy than syphilis; itclearly refers to a very different disease from the one that is now referred toas ‘syphilis’; as acknowledged by Herbert Shelton who states that,> “The original ‘syphilis’ and what is called ‘syphilis’ today are not the same> symptom-complex at all.”A major flaw in the hypothesis that syphilis originated in the New World, isthat 15th and 16th century eyewitness accounts do not describe any of theindigenous peoples as being covered in pustules or with their flesh hanging fromtheir faces. The evidence referred to in the discussion about smallpox, revealsthat the documented accounts describe the indigenous people as scrupulouslyclean. As also cited in the smallpox discussion, Dr Stannard refers to incidentsin which the Spanish conquistadors committed rape, but this fails to provide‘evidence’ that syphilis either originated in the New World or that it issexually transmitted.The hypothesis that syphilis was previously unrecognised also fails to provide aclear explanation for its origin, or for the notion that it is sexuallytransmitted. There is, in fact, no evidence that definitively demonstratessyphilis to be sexually transmissible; it is certainly not caused by abacterium.The discussion about leprosy indicated that the label had been used for avariety of skin problems that were usually treated with mercury. However, thedangers of mercury remained unknown and mercury ointments became the standardtreatment for syphilis as well as leprosy; as Dr Carolyn Dean explains,> “When syphilis appeared in Europe, around 1495, those same ointments were used> for its skin manifestations. Its side effects slowly became known and were> listed openly centuries later in old medical texts, but mercury and its side> effects were tolerated because the effects of untreated syphilis were felt to> be much more dangerous than the side effects of the ‘cure’. Syphilis was> responsible for keeping mercury ostensibly viable for 400 years…”The recognised symptoms of mercury poisoning include the shedding and peeling ofthe skin, symptoms that may have been diagnosed as syphilis, leprosy or evensmallpox. The symptoms that are now associated with syphilis are substantiallydifferent; although mercury remained a ‘treatment’ until the early 20th century.One of the main methods for diagnosing any disease relies on the symptoms orsymptom-complex displayed by the patient. However, in the case of a diagnosis ofsyphilis, the symptoms are not always specific and therefore not easilyrecognisable. This point is acknowledged in the Atlantic article cited abovethat discusses the problem with the identification of syphilis, because,> “…the symptoms of syphilis often mimic those of other diseases.”The article also states that,> “…syphilis can be difficult to prevent and to recognise…”Syphilis has long been referred to as ‘the great imitator’, as Herbert Sheltonexplains in detail in his 1962 book entitled Syphilis: Is it a Mischievous Mythor a Malignant Monster,> “Let us take the paradox that ‘syphilis’ not only imitates every other known> disease, so that no man, in the absence of reliable serologic tests, can> possibly diagnose the ‘disease’ from its symptoms and pathology alone (a fact> that makes it difficult to understand how physicians of the past ever> discovered that there is such a disease), but also imitates health.”It was the discovery in 1905 of the bacterium Treponema pallidum, the alleged‘pathogen’, that instigated the changes to both the diagnosis and treatment ofsyphilis. One of the main changes was the introduction of the Wassermann test,which was claimed to assist a correct diagnosis of syphilis by the detection ofantibodies to the bacterium. The interpretation of the test was that thepresence of the ‘right’ antibodies was claimed to prove ‘infection’. Theconflicting interpretations of the presence of antibodies have been discussed.One of the problems with the Wassermann test was that the results were notspecific to syphilis. In his book, Herbert Shelton refers to a number ofdiseases that could produce a positive test result; interestingly they includeleprosy as well as malaria and diabetes.He also states that pregnancy was able to produce a positive Wassermann testresult; a situation that clearly demonstrates the test was not specific to any‘disease’ and therefore a totally inappropriate method of diagnosing syphilis.Unfortunately for Americans during the early 20th century, a negative Wassermanntest result was a prerequisite for the issuance of a marriage licence. Apositive test result could, and in many instances did, have serious and eventragic consequences, an example of which is related by Herbert Shelton,> “A few years ago, Walter Winchell told of a prospective groom who received a> notice that his blood was ‘positive’. This meant that he would be denied a> license to marry. He was now a branded man. He committed suicide. Several days> after his suicide, the laboratory forwarded a corrected ‘negative’ report with> an apology for the error it had made.”The Wassermann test was not restricted to adults prior to marriage; it was alsoused to test all members of a family, including children of all ages, in theevent of a positive test result for one parent. The reason that children weretested was not due to any suspicions about sexual abuse; it was due to a beliefthat children born to parents with syphilis would have hereditary ‘defects’.This belief, which had not been based on any scientific evidence, was laterproven to be totally unfounded.The origin of the belief in an association between sexual activity and syphilisremains elusive; there is no evidence that syphilis is a sexually transmitteddisease. The only plausible explanation for the original belief is that it was aremnant of long-held superstitions that ‘disease’ was a punishment from the godsfor sins committed; and that syphilis was therefore the punishment for the sinof sexual activity.What is most significant is that syphilis is first recognised during the timewhen the vast majority of the population of Europe lived in highly insanitaryconditions, which included a lack of clean water for either bathing or forwashing clothes. The eruption of pustules as a method of eliminating toxins canoccur anywhere on the body, including the genitals; especially when this area ofthe body is rarely washed. However, the people rarely washed any parts of theirbodies and often wore the same items of apparel, which were infrequently changedand rarely washed.The improvements in sanitation and personal hygiene during the past century,indicate that, in the 21st century, skin eruptions in the genital area must haveother causes, none of which relates to a bacterial ‘infection’ or to sexualactivity.Syphilis is no longer diagnosed using Wassermann tests, but the tests that havereplaced them are no more reliable or accurate because the disease remainsadmittedly difficult to recognise. There are some tests that are said to be ableto detect the presence of the bacterium when viewed with dark-field microscopy,but detection of the presence of a bacterium does not prove it is the cause ofthe condition. As previously discussed, the presence of bacteria in the body isentirely normal.Although, as indicated by its title, the Atlantic article suggests that there isa resurgence of this disease, it states that,> “Syphilis had become relatively rare in developed countries since the> discovery of penicillin…”The discussions in the previous chapter demonstrate that penicillin cannot beclaimed to be responsible for the reduction in the incidence of any disease.However, although sanitation and personal hygiene habits have improved, theyhave failed to completely eradicate this ‘disease’; this means that otherfactors must be involved. One of the factors that have been shown to contributesubstantially to the body burden of toxins is vaccination, which has also beenshown to be associated with the development of many diseases. Althoughpreviously cited, the words of Eleanor McBean bear repetition,> “Many vaccines also cause other diseases besides the one for which they are> given. For instance, smallpox vaccine often causes syphilis, paralysis,> leprosy, and cancer.”Vaccines have also been shown to produce other effects, as Herbert Sheltonexplains,> “It was discovered that smallpox vaccination will give a positive Wassermann> reaction…”This provides further evidence that this test is unable to detect any specific‘disease’.The resurgence of syphilis is reported in the Atlantic article to be based onstatistics from 2014 produced by the CDC. These statistics have been updated andare reported in an October 2016 Press Release entitled 2015 STD SurveillanceReport Press Release on the CDC website. The press release claims that all STDs,not just syphilis, have increased in incidence, and adds the comment that,> “Most STD cases continue to go undiagnosed and untreated…”Unsurprisingly, the CDC also claims that,> “Widespread access to screening and treatment would reduce their spread.”Unfortunately, the recommended treatment includes antibiotics, the problems withwhich were discussed in the previous chapter.It is clear that reports about the increased incidence of syphilis, whether trueor not, serve the interests of the medical establishment and support theirefforts to continue to generate fear. The trend to continually increase the useof antibiotics is a complete contradiction of the acknowledgement that they arevastly overused; the medical establishment cannot justify both views.It is also clear that there is no need to invoke the existence of a ‘germ’ or toblame sexual activity as an explanation of the disease that has been namedsyphilis. The same applies to any other so-called ‘sexually transmitteddisease’.1918 FluThe establishment definition of influenza refers to,> “a highly contagious virus infection that affects the respiratory system.”It is claimed that influenza, or ‘the flu’, is often a seasonal illness, thesymptoms of which are described by the November 2018 WHO fact sheet entitledInfluenza (Seasonal),> “Seasonal influenza is characterized by a sudden onset of fever, cough> (usually dry), headache, muscle and joint pain, severe malaise (feeling> unwell), sore throat and a runny nose.”Although it is not regarded as an inherently dangerous illness, the fact sheetadds that,> “…influenza can cause severe illness or death especially in people at high> risk.”The sectors of the population considered to be at ‘high risk’ are childrenyounger than the age of 5, adults older than the age of 65, pregnant women andpeople with certain chronic medical conditions.The influenza epidemic of the early 20th century that is generally referred toas the ‘1918 Flu’ is claimed to have been responsible for the loss of manymillions of lives. In marked contrast with other outbreaks of ‘influenza’,seasonal or otherwise, this epidemic had a far greater impact on a completelydifferent demographic, as it mainly affected adults between the ages of 20 and40. Furthermore, contemporary sources indicate that the symptoms of thisepidemic bore very little resemblance to the usual symptoms of flu. An articleentitled The Influenza Pandemic of 1918 on the Stanford University websiterelates some of the symptoms reported by physicians,> “Others told stories of people on their way to work suddenly developing the> flu and dying within hours. One physician writes that patients with seemingly> ordinary influenza would rapidly ‘develop the most viscous type of pneumonia> that has ever been seen’ and later when cyanosis appeared in the patients, ‘it> is simply a struggle for air until they suffocate’. Another physician recalls> that the influenza patients ‘died struggling to clear their airways of a> blood-tinged froth that sometimes gushed from their nose and mouth’. The> physicians of the time were helpless against this powerful agent of> influenza.”This was clearly no ordinary ‘influenza’.Despite the severe nature of these symptoms and its impact on young adults,rather than those in ‘high risk’ groups, the medical establishment maintains theassertion that this was an epidemic of ‘influenza’ and that it was caused by avirus. A typical example of this stance is provided by the CDC in a 2006 articleentitled 1918 Influenza: the Mother of All Pandemics that claims,> “All influenza A pandemics since that time, and indeed almost all cases of> influenza A worldwide...have been caused by descendants of the 1918 virus…”Nothing could be further from the truth; a non-living particle cannot have a‘descendant’.The refutation of the ‘germ theory’ means that no type of influenza can becaused by a virus and this, in turn, means that there must be other, morecompelling explanations for this epidemic of an allegedly ‘infectious’ disease.The label ‘1918 Flu’ suggests that the epidemic only occurred during the year1918; however, there is evidence that indicates serious ill-health problemsexisted over the course of a much longer period of time, which began as early as1915 and continued until the late 1920s. There are compelling explanations forthese health problems; as this discussion will demonstrate.One of the many anomalies that emerge from mainstream reports about the ‘1918Flu’ is the wide variation in the mortality statistics that are quoted; somereports claim that between 20 and 40 million lives were lost, others claim theupper figure to be 50 million; whereas some even suggest the figure could havereached 100 million. Although it is inevitable that these figures can only beestimates, such an incredibly wide margin indicates a paucity of reliableoriginal data to support the mortality claimed to have been caused solely by the‘flu’.It is claimed that the ‘1918 Flu’ accounted for more deaths than the First WorldWar, which ended in November 1918 after four years of worldwide conflict.Whether this claim can be substantiated or not, it should be obvious that thewar and the epidemic cannot be regarded as unrelated. The connection betweenthem has been recognised, albeit to a limited extent, by the medicalestablishment; as indicated by a 2010 article entitled The US Military and theInfluenza Pandemic of 1918-1919 that states,> “World War 1 and influenza collaborated: the war fostered disease by creating> conditions in the trenches of France that some epidemiologists believe enabled> the influenza virus to evolve into a killer of global proportions.”There was no virus that evolved into a ‘killer’; however, the conditions enduredby the troops engaged in the conflict would certainly have had a direct anddetrimental impact on their health. It is obvious that soldiers engaged in theactual fighting were at the forefront of the threat to life and limb, but theyalso faced dangers other than those posed by the human enemy they fought.Military personnel are supposed to be the fittest and healthiest group withinany population; after all, fitness and health are prerequisites for admittanceinto military service. However, some reports indicate that soldiers were amongthe most severely affected by the influenza epidemic; for example, a 2014article entitled Death from 1918 pandemic influenza during the First World Warstates that,> “Pandemic influenza struck all the armies, but the highest morbidity rate was> found amongst the American as the disease sickened 26% of the US Army, over> one million men.”The article also reports that,> “…the German army recorded over 700,000 cases of influenza…”It is clear therefore, that the ‘disease’ affected all parties to the conflict;which raises questions about the origin of the disease and the transmission of‘germs’ between soldiers on opposing sides of the war.The seemingly virulent nature of the disease has led to some attempts to tracethe ‘source’ of the outbreak, although clearly any such attempt that is based onlocating a ‘virus’ is doomed to failure. Nevertheless, these efforts haveuncovered details that are useful to an investigation of the real causes; forexample, the 2014 article cited above refers to the conditions in the trenchesand states,> “The origin of the influenza pandemic has been inextricably linked with the> men who occupied the military camps and trenches during the First World War.”There are genuine explanations for the illness that existed in the militarycamps and in the trenches; however, although related to a certain extent, theseexplanations do not rely on the theory that the troops were responsible for thespread of an ‘infectious’ germ.One of the contributory factors for the ill-health suffered by the troops isvaccination; all soldiers received a number of vaccines against a variety ofdiseases they were thought likely to encounter. The previously cited 2010article refers to vaccines for rabies, typhoid fever, diphtheria and smallpox.Another contributory factor was the ‘medicines’ with which the ill and woundedwere treated. Eleanor McBean refers to the 1918 Flu in Swine Flu Exposé andstates that,> “It was a common expression during the war that ‘more soldiers were killed by> vaccine shots than by shots from enemy guns.’ The vaccines, in addition to the> poison drugs given in the hospitals, made healing impossible in too many> cases. If the men had not been young and healthy to begin with, they would all> have succumbed to the mass poisoning in the Army.”The ‘medicine’ commonly prescribed for the treatment of influenza during theearly 20th century was aspirin, the dangers of which were unknown at the time.But its dangers have since been recognised and aspirin has been shown to causerespiratory problems; as indicated by a November 2009 article entitledSalicylates and Pandemic Influenza Mortality, 1918-1919 Pharmacology, Pathologyand Historic Evidence that states,> “Pharmacokinetic data, which were unavailable in 1918, indicate that the> aspirin regimens recommended for the ‘Spanish influenza’ predispose to severe> pulmonary toxicity.”The article refers to pathology findings reported during 1918 and states thatthey are,> “…consistent with aspirin toxicity.”The symptoms described by the previously cited Stanford University article arestrikingly similar to symptoms that are recognised to result from a high intakeof aspirin. This does not mean that it is the ‘dose’ that makes aspirin apoison; instead, it means that very serious and often fatal effects are theresult of a high intake of aspirin. Low doses are also toxic, but their effectsare less severe and may even remain undetected.One of the consequences of the war was the need for a constant supply of newrecruits to replace the soldiers who had been injured or killed. This need foradditional troops meant that entry requirements for admittance to the militarywere, by necessity, lowered. The inevitable result of this was that the newrecruits were not necessarily as fit and healthy as the men they replaced, andthey were therefore more vulnerable to the effects of the toxic vaccines andmedicines and to the appalling conditions they had to endure.In addition to providing aspirin as treatment for ‘influenza’, the medicalestablishment also attempted to develop vaccines to combat as well as preventthe disease, which was originally believed to be caused by a bacterium. Thesevaccines are discussed in a 2009 article entitled The fog of research: Influenzavaccine trials during the 1918-19 pandemic which states that,> “Bacterial vaccines of various sorts were widely used for both preventive and> therapeutic purposes during the great influenza pandemic of 1918-19. Some were> derived exclusively from the Pfeiffer's bacillus, the presumed cause of> influenza, while others contained one or more other organisms found in the> lungs of victims. Although initially most reports of the use of these vaccines> claimed that they prevented influenza or pneumonia, the results were> inconsistent and sometimes contradictory.”Although it is now firmly believed that the 1918 pandemic was due to viralinfluenza, in 1918 it was firmly believed that the disease was pneumonia, or acombination of influenza and pneumonia, and that it was caused by a bacteriumcalled Pfeiffer’s bacillus.A 2010 article entitled The State of Science, Microbiology and Vaccines Circa1918 further explains the uncertain nature of those early vaccine trials,> “Many vaccines were developed and used during the 1918-1919 pandemic. The> medical literature was full of contradictory claims of their success; there> was apparently no consensus on how to judge the reported results of these> vaccine trials.”The vaccines were clearly recognised to have been of dubious efficacy, yet theunderlying theory, that the cause was a bacterium, was not questioned; the ideathat the disease was infectious also remained unquestioned. Chapter three refersto a description by Herbert Shelton of an experiment that had failed todemonstrate the infectious nature of the ‘1918 Flu’. In his article entitledContagion, he describes a number of other experiments that attempted todetermine the alleged bacterial agent that caused the disease,> “Several groups of volunteers were inoculated with pure cultures of Pfeiffer’s> bacillus, with the secretions of the upper respiratory passages and with blood> taken from typical influenza cases. About 30 of the men had the germs sprayed> and swabbed in the nose and throat. The Public Health Report sums up the> results in these words: ’In no instance was an attack of influenza produced in> any one of the subjects’.”As previously cited, Herbert Shelton refers to epidemics as ‘mass sickness’, towhich he adds the comment,> “For example, in the 1918-19 influenza-pneumonia pandemic, there were great> numbers of cases of mumps, of measles, of typhoid fever, of sleeping sickness,> and more cases of colds than influenza.”Inexplicably, despite these other diseases, the pandemic is only ever referredto as one of ‘influenza’. The incidence of other diseases indicates that peoplewere not all suffering from the same symptom-complex; which means that they werenot all suffering from the same ‘disease’ that had a single causal agent;whether viral or bacterial.Two of the other diseases that Herbert Shelton reports as coinciding with the‘flu pandemic’ require further discussion, because they provide additionalevidence for some of the factors that contributed to the illness that islabelled as ‘flu’.According to some contemporary reports, there were many cases of typhoid feverwithin the military; however, this was one of the diseases against which thesoldiers had been vaccinated. It would therefore be extremely inconvenient forthe medical establishment, and especially for the vaccine industry, if soldierswere reported to be suffering from a disease against which they had beenvaccinated and therefore seemingly ‘protected’. It would not be unreasonable toassume, therefore, that certain illnesses were re-classified as ‘influenza’. Themedical establishment practice of renaming conditions has been shown to be a notuncommon one; the re-classification of polio as AFP is only one example of thepractice.Sleeping sickness is more often called sleepy sickness in order to differentiateit from African sleeping sickness, or trypanosomiasis. However, sleepy sicknesshas another name; it is also called ‘lethargic encephalitis’ (LE), which isclaimed to be the result of a viral or bacterial infection. It is reported thatan epidemic of LE occurred during the period between 1916 and 1930. This was asingular event; LE had never previously erupted as an epidemic, nor has it everdone so since that time, although it is still claimed to exist. It issignificant that this epidemic of LE is synchronous with the epidemic of‘influenza’.Dr Peter Breggin MD refers to LE in his 2008 article entitled Parallels betweenNeuroleptic Effects and Lethargic Encephalitis and states,> “Lethargic encephalitis (LE) was identified by von Economo in the winter of> 1916-1917 in Vienna. The pandemic was most severe in Europe and North America,> with cases reported throughout the world. Over a decade, the disease afflicted> more than a million people and caused hundreds of thousands of fatalities. The> last epidemic was reported in 1926 and the disease largely disappeared by> 1930.”Chlorpromazine was the first neuroleptic drug; it was developed in the 1950s andis still in use; the trade name is Thorazine. In Toxic Psychiatry, Dr Bregginrefers to Delay and Deniker, two French psychiatrists who were among the firstto use chlorpromazine to treat their patients; Dr Breggin relates that,> “They immediately noticed that small doses produced a neurological disease> very similar to a special type of virulent flu virus that killed tens of> thousands during and shortly after the First World War.”Although he refers to a ‘flu virus’, his reference to a ‘neurological disease’is highly significant; he adds that,> “The type of flu mimicked by the drugs was called lethargic encephalitis…”Dr Breggin’s 2008 article expands on the similarity between the effects ofneuroleptic drugs and the symptoms of LE; neuroleptic drugs are also known asantipsychotic drugs and are used for patients diagnosed with some ‘psychiatricdisorders’, especially schizophrenia. The epidemic of lethargic encephalitis wasnot caused by neuroleptic drugs; however, it is clear that certainpharmaceuticals are capable of inducing a ‘neurological disease’; which meansthat their ingredients must be neurotoxic.The ingredients of the vaccines of the early 20th century are different fromthose of the vaccines of the early 21st century; but the features they share aretheir toxicity and neurotoxicity. There is also evidence that 20th centuryvaccines could produce lethargic encephalitis; as recorded by Annie Riley Halein her book entitled The Medical Voodoo,> “In the British Journal of Experimental Pathology August 1926, two well-known> London medical professors, Drs Turnbull and McIntosh, reported several cases> of encephalitis lethargica – ‘sleeping sickness’ – following vaccination which> had come under their observation.”Post-vaccination encephalitis is a recognised phenomenon; as indicated by aSeptember 1931 article entitled Post-Vaccination Encephalitis that states,> “Post-vaccination encephalitis is a disease of unknown etiology that has> appeared in recent years and which occurs without regard to the existence of> known factors other than the presence of a recent vaccination against> smallpox.”The smallpox vaccination may not have been the only vaccine capable of causingencephalitis; as mentioned above, there were others available in 1918. Thearticle makes a further interesting comment that,> “Drug manufacturers aggressively promoted their stock vaccines for colds,> grippe and flu. These vaccines were of undisclosed composition.”Further evidence to support the assertion that vaccinations were contributoryfactors to the illness labelled as ‘1918 Flu’ is provided by Virus Mania, inwhich the authors state that,> “A frequently observed symptom of the Spanish flu was internal bleeding in the> lung (typical of tuberculosis patients for example) – a phenomenon that was> also described as a result of smallpox vaccinations.”All vaccinations of the early 20th century contained toxic ingredients, whichthey also describe,> “Additionally, the medications and vaccines applied in masses at that time> contained highly toxic substances like heavy metals, arsenic, formaldehyde and> chloroform...”Although medicines, such as aspirin, and vaccinations contributed substantially,they were not the only factors relevant to the morbidity and mortalityattributed to the ‘influenza epidemic’.The early 20th century was also a period during which chemical manufactureincreased; one chemical in particular, namely chlorine, is relevant to thisdiscussion.In his book entitled Pandora’s Poison, Joe Thornton discusses in detail theextremely toxic nature of chlorine gas, which, although a chemical element isnot an element that occurs naturally. He explains that, in nature, chlorine isalways found within a chloride salt, a substance that is stable and relativelyharmless. However, in the late 18th century, a chemical experiment unexpectedlyproduced chlorine gas, which is highly reactive, destructive and deadly, as JoeThornton explains,> “First recognised as an element in the early nineteenth century, chlorine is a> heavy, green-colored gas with a powerful odor. If released into the> environment, chlorine gas will travel slowly over the ground in a coherent> cloud, a phenomenon familiar to World War I soldiers who faced it as a> chemical weapon, one of chlorine’s first large-scale applications. Also> familiar to these men was chlorine’s toxicity, which arises from its tendency> to combine with and destroy organic matter, like that of the lungs and eyes.”He also details a number of extremely important facts about the military use ofchlorine during the period of WWI,> “Elemental chlorine was first deployed in 1915 on the battlefields of Ypres,> with horrific consequences.”The chemical industry continued to experiment with chlorine and produced furtherweapons, as Joe Thornton also explains,> “The military industry soon began to make other chlorine-based chemical> weapons, such as phosgene and mustard gas (dichlorodiethyl sulphide), which> made their debuts during the next two years at Verdun and again at Ypres.”The industrial development of chlorine-based chemicals for the military industrywas undertaken by both sides in WWI, as he further explains,> “As both sides developed sophisticated means to deliver war gases in shells,> grenades, and other armaments, casualties of chlorine chemical weapons rose> into the tens of thousands.”Although not inherently fatal, survivors of a chlorine gas attack would haverespiratory problems for the rest of their lives; Joe Thornton details theeffects they suffered,> “Chlorinated chemicals were particularly effective chemical weapons because> they were highly toxic and oil soluble, so they could cross cell membranes and> destroy the tissues of lungs, eyes and skin, incapacitating soldiers and> causing extreme pain.”These symptoms are not unlike those described by the Stanford Universityarticle, which suggests the likelihood that cases of chlorine gassing mayinitially have been mistakenly identified as cases of ‘influenza’.Chlorine-based chemicals are discussed further in chapter six; they are,however, not the only type of chemical that can produce respiratory problemsthat may also have been mistakenly identified as ‘influenza’. Nitroglycerin wasfirst produced prior to the 20th century, but is reported to have beenmanufactured in large quantities and used extensively during WWI. Thesignificance of nitro-glycerine is reported by Nicholas Ashford PhD and DrClaudia Miller MD in their 1998 book entitled Chemical Exposures: Low Levels andHigh Stakes, in which they state that,> “Nitroglycerin, used to manufacture gunpowder, rocket fuels and dynamite, may> cause severe headaches, breathing difficulties, weakness, drowsiness, nausea> and vomiting as a result of inhalation.”These symptoms are remarkably similar to some of the symptoms attributed to both‘influenza’ and ‘lethargic encephalitis’.The ‘war effort’ inevitably created a substantially increased demand for theindustrial manufacture of machinery, equipment and weapons, many of which neededto be welded; welding is another hazardous occupation as Nicholas Ashford and DrMiller also explain,> “Welding and galvanised metal causes evolution of zinc oxide fumes that, when> inhaled, provoke an influenza-like syndrome with headaches, nausea, weakness,> myalgia, coughing, dyspnea and fever.”Dyspnoea refers to breathing difficulties.It is clear that many factors can produce severe illness and symptoms that mayhave been attributed to influenza.As part of the recognition of the centennial anniversary of WWI, the ImperialWar Museum in England produced a website containing material about the conflict,including a number of audio recordings made by survivors of that carnage whotalk about their experiences, particularly in the trenches. The war veteranstalk about the atrocious conditions they had to endure; that they were often upto their stomachs in water and that their dugouts were just mud and filth.They report that in the freezing winter weather their wet boots froze overnighton their feet, leading to the numbness that is referred to as ‘trench foot’.Some also described how they were ‘casual’ in their latrines and ‘casual’ inburying their dead. They also provide useful insights about the poor diet theyendured, stating that it consisted of a little meat, bread, chocolate andcheese; in addition, most of them smoked. They carried their water in petrolcans and occasionally had a rum ration; they claim that the quantity of foodthey had was poor, but clearly the quality was extremely poor.It should be obvious that many of the conditions they suffered can be likened tothe insanitary and unhygienic conditions that prevailed in the centuries beforesanitary reforms were introduced. It is therefore unsurprising that many menwere ill and died as the result of the years they spent living in suchconditions; it seems remarkable that any men were able to survive such atrociousconditions.The audio recordings also explain that, as well as those who were directlyinvolved in the war, there were others, women mostly, who assisted the wareffort by working in munitions factories, for example. Their jobs includedfilling the shells with cordite or ‘the black powder’ as they called it. Theyalso worked with hazardous substances like TNT, which is trinitrotoluene, ahighly toxic substance.It is abundantly obvious that the ‘epidemic’ represented a unique time inhistory; that it involved the sickness and death of many millions of people. Itis also abundantly obvious that these high levels of morbidity and mortalitywere not due to a disease caused by a virus, but that there were manycontributory factors that acted together and synergistically.In the effort by the medical establishment to maintain the viral hypothesis forthis epidemic, a number of reports refer to a University of Arizona study thathas made an apparent ‘discovery’ of how the alleged 1918 ‘flu virus was able tokill many millions of people over the course of a very short period of time.This study is quoted to have included the comment that,> “Ever since the great flu pandemic of 1918, it has been a mystery where that> virus came from and why it was so severe and, in particular, why it killed> young adults in the prime of life.”Yet the ‘answer’ provided by the study fails to explain the mystery; instead, itclaims that the adults who succumbed to the flu had antibodies to a differentflu virus that had caused an earlier, less virulent epidemic, and that thereforethey did not have immunity to the virus that was responsible for the epidemic in1918.The previous discussions about immunity and antibodies demonstrate that this‘answer’ contradicts some of the basic tenets of the ‘germ theory’; but the‘germ theory’ itself fails to explain the reason that only certain people becameill, whilst others remained unaffected. This anomaly is exposed by HerbertShelton, who states,> “If the ‘epidemic influence’ were the cause of the epidemic then all who come> within its range would develop the ‘epidemic disease’.”This clearly did not occur during 1918 and 1919. Eleanor McBean, who was a childduring the epidemic and assisted her parents to care for the sick, reports thatshe failed to become ill despite her close proximity to many people with theallegedly ‘infectious’ disease.It is abundantly obvious that there was no ‘epidemic disease’. The stresses ofwar and combat, the multiple toxic vaccinations, the use of toxic ‘medicines’,the appalling conditions in which soldiers lived and fought, the exposure todeadly chlorine gas and other toxic materials provide ample evidence toadequately explain the epidemic of illness and the devastating loss of life.These factors, which acted synergistically, provide a compelling explanation forthis singular event without the need to invoke the existence of an elusivevirus. This ‘epidemic’ was, however, a worldwide phenomenon, as will bediscussed further in chapter eight.The Black DeathThe establishment definition of ‘plague’ refers to,> “an acute epidemic disease of rats and other wild rodents caused by the> bacterium Yersinia pestis, which is transmitted to humans by rat fleas.”According to the October 2017 WHO fact sheet entitled Plague,> “People infected with plague usually develop acute febrile disease with other> non-specific systemic symptoms after an incubation period of one to seven> days, such as sudden onset of fever, chills, head and body aches, and> weakness, vomiting and nausea.”The fact sheet claims that there are two main forms of plague; bubonic andpneumonic.It is reported that, in the past there have been three major outbreaks of‘plague’, although a number of minor outbreaks have also occurred.The first of the major epidemics occurred in the 5th century BCE and is oftenreferred to as the Plague of Athens. An article entitled The Plague on thewebsite (livius.org), refers to the writings of Thucydides, a Greek historian ofthe period. The article contains excerpts from his work that refer to theepidemic and describe a wide range of symptoms experienced by people who hadbeen affected; they include violent spasms, bleeding mouth and a sensation ofinternal burning.The second epidemic occurred in the 6th century CE and is often referred to asthe Plague of Justinian, who was the Roman Emperor of the period. An articleentitled Justinian’s Plague on the website (ancient.eu), refers to the writingsof Procopius, a Byzantine historian of the period. The article states that fewdetails are known about the symptoms, but that they are reported to haveincluded delusions, fever and coma.A significant feature of both epidemics is the suddenness of the onset ofsymptoms that were of a far more serious nature than those described by the‘plague’ fact sheet.The third major epidemic occurred in the 14th century CE and is usually referredto as the Black Death. Fortunately, several contemporary eyewitness accountshave survived and these enable a better understanding of the prevailingconditions that, in turn, offer a better explanation than that of an‘infectious’ bacterial disease, which, in view of the refutation of the ‘germtheory’, cannot be the case.It is generally claimed that the Black Death erupted spontaneously; that itspread rapidly around the world; and that it caused millions of deaths; the WHOfact sheet claims the total mortality to have been an estimated 50 millionpeople.The mainstream narrative about the epidemic states that the fleas, which aresaid to normally live on rats, suddenly became ‘infected’ with dangerousbacteria that cause a deadly form of ‘plague’. These infected fleas are said tohave spread their dangerous bacteria to vast populations of rats, whichsuccumbed to the deadly disease and died in incredibly huge numbers. It is alsoclaimed that when their rat hosts died, the ‘infected’ fleas moved to new,mostly human, hosts.The transfer of infected rat fleas to human hosts is claimed to be the mechanismby which many millions of people ‘caught’ the disease, became ill and died indevastatingly large numbers. It is also claimed that the reason so many peopledied is because they had no ‘immunity’ to the disease.Yet again; nothing could be further from the truth.Although the above is only a brief overview, it nevertheless illustrates themain points in the mainstream narrative. There are, however, a number of seriousflaws in this narrative; as this discussion will demonstrate.One of the main problems is that 14th century records do not refer to vasthordes of dead rats, which, if the mainstream narrative were correct, ought tohave littered the streets of all the countries that are claimed to have beenaffected by the Black Death. Equally problematic is the incredibly rapid speedwith which the disease is reported to have spread; a circumstance that cannot beaccounted for by the ‘rat-flea’ story. A further point that remains entirelyunexplained is how the fleas were completely unaffected by the disease-causingbacteria they are alleged to have carried.The first of these flaws has been recognised by British archaeologist, BarneySloane, who has claimed that the ‘Black Death’ could not have been transmittedby rats; as reported in an August 2011 article entitled Can We Stop Blaming Ratsfor the Black Death. The article refers to archaeological work that has beenconducted in London and states that,> “…excavations in the city have turned up little evidence of a massive rat> die-off coinciding with the plague.”The article also refers to an alternative theory that has been posited; thistheory suggests that the conditions of the 14th century would have been morefavourable to gerbils than to rats. However, there is no evidence to supportthis theory; the archaeological excavations failed to uncover evidence of amassive gerbil die off; but this is unsurprising as gerbils are not native toEngland.There has been a slight amendment to the establishment theory about the BlackDeath since the 2007 edition of the dictionary that is used for the diseasedefinitions in this book. The WHO fact sheet refers to ‘small animals’ ratherthan rodents as the vectors of transmission. However, this explanation isequally invalid, because there is no evidence from the archaeological site inLondon that there had been a massive die off of any type of small animal.The rapid speed with which the disease is claimed to have been spread has beenrecognised as problematic by scientists and archaeologists involved in theLondon excavations. The lack of an obvious animal ‘carrier’ has led to theproposal of other hypotheses, one of which is that the ‘infection’ was airborne,rather than animal-borne, and that transmission occurred through the atmosphereand via human contact. But this hypothesis fails to explain the basic mechanismby which a virulent and deadly ‘disease’ suddenly erupted, prevailed for anumber of years and then suddenly disappeared. The reported duration of theepidemic varies between 3 and 8 years.These anomalies highlight serious flaws in the explanations about the purportedmechanisms of diseases described as ‘infectious’.The previous discussion about the ‘1918 Flu’ demonstrated that the sudden onsetof ‘disease’ and the resulting widespread morbidity and mortality are related tomultiple factors that often act synergistically; these factors do not includeany so-called ‘germ’.There is an inherent tendency to view historical events in the light ofprevailing theories. It is therefore unsurprising that, with the ‘germ theory’firmly entrenched in medical establishment thinking, the ‘Black Death’ continuesto be reported as an ‘infectious disease’ caused by bacteria, which, accordingto the WHO fact sheet, are,> “…usually found in small mammals and their fleas.”The archaeological evidence has not yet persuaded the medical establishment toalter their obviously incorrect theory.It sometimes requires a scientist from an entirely different scientificdiscipline to view evidence from a new perspective, and thereby produce a morecompelling explanation for that evidence. In this instance, a new hypothesisabout the likely causes of the Black Death has been developed by adendrochronologist, a scientist who studies tree-rings to identify differentgrowth patterns.The dendrochronologist in this instance is Professor Mike Baillie, whose studyof tree-ring data of the 14th century led him to discover some interesting treegrowth patterns, and to undertake further investigations that included the studyof ice-core data, as well as contemporary 14th century accounts of the event.Professor Baillie has recorded the results of his research and the basis for hishypothesis in his book entitled New Light on the Black Death, in which heincludes extracts from some contemporary documents. One of the extracts hequotes includes the statement that,> “There have been masses of dead fish, animals and other things along the sea> shore and in many places trees covered in dust .... and all these things seem> to have come from the great corruption of the air and earth.”Contemporary writers were sufficiently observant to be aware of, and writeabout, ‘masses of dead fish, animals and other things along the sea shore’, aswell as ‘trees covered in dust’. They would, therefore, also have beensufficiently observant to have noticed, and specifically written about, massesof dead rats or even gerbils, had there been any to observe. Such reports areconspicuous by their absence; a situation that supports the archaeologicalfindings.An even more significant aspect of the quoted extract is the reference to ‘thegreat corruption of the air and earth’. In addition to these documents,Professor Baillie obtained evidence from his examination of tree rings that ledto his statement that,> “The Black Death sits in a clear environmental trough visible in smoothed tree> ring chronologies from around the world.”The corruption of the atmosphere certainly must have been extremely severe tohave been able to generate a ‘clear environmental trough’; it was sufficientlysevere to have been able to cause death from respiratory problems; as ProfessorBaillie states,> “The most likely mechanism would be through affecting their respiration system> in some catastrophic way. After all, writer after writer on the Black Death> makes the point that it is the ‘pulmonary’ form of the disease that was the> dominant killer.”It is clear therefore that ‘something’ must have occurred to have caused such asevere corruption of the atmosphere over a large portion of the world. Oneinteresting and undisputed fact is that a major earthquake erupted in Europe on25th January 1348. Professor Baillie reveals however, that this was not asingular event, but part of a series of earthquakes that occurred during themid-14th century, both before and after the January earthquake.Another interesting piece of the puzzle is that an unusually high level ofammonium has been discovered from the examination of ice core data. A higherthan normal level of ammonium has also been discovered in ice cores that havebeen dated to periods in which other epidemics of ‘plague’ occurred. The resultof his investigation of the evidence led Professor Baillie to conclude that,> “There really is enough information about comets, earthquakes and ammonium to> permit the quite serious suggestion that the Black Death was due to an impact> by comet debris on 25th January 1348 as witnessed by the major earthquake on> that day.”Investigations and analysis of the toxic chemicals found within comets and cometdebris have produced further supportive evidence for this conclusion; ProfessorBaillie explains,> “Apart from ammonium, it is now known that a range of unpleasant, toxic and> evil-smelling chemicals, including hydrogen sulphide and carbon disulphide,> have been detected in recent comets.”The presence of ‘evil-smelling chemicals’ would certainly explain the documentedreports about the ‘corruption of the atmosphere’; their toxicity also explainshow these chemicals would have caused severe respiration problems and rapiddeath from asphyxiation for those people in close proximity to the denseatmospheric poisoning.Herbert Shelton provides further documentary evidence of 14th centuryearthquakes and the subsequent pollution of the atmosphere, in his 1967 articleentitled Pestilence and Plagues that states,> “Hecker’s Epidemics of the Middle Ages says of the Plague that ‘mighty> revolutions in the organism of the earth, of which we have credible> information, had preceded it. From China to the Atlantic the foundations of> the earth were shaken, throughout Asia and Europe the atmosphere was in> commotion, and endangered by its baneful influence, both vegetable and animal> life’.”In the same article, Herbert Shelton also quotes from Berdoe’s Origins andGrowth of the Healing Art that provides further information about the prevailingconditions,> “In 1337, four millions of people perished by famine in China in the> neighbourhood of Kiang alone. Floods, famine and earthquakes were frequent,> both in Asia and Europe. In Cyprus a pestiferous wind spread a poisonous odor> before an earthquake shook the island to its foundations, and many of the> inhabitants fell down suddenly and expired in dreadful agonies after inhaling> the noxious gases. German chemists state that a thick stinking mist advanced> from the East and spread over Italy in thousands of places, and vast chasms> opened in the earth which exhaled the most noxious vapors.”These conditions can be explained by comets, comet debris and earthquakes; theycannot be explained by rat fleas ‘infected’ with disease-causing bacteria.Another outbreak of ‘plague’ occurred in England during the 17th century.Although it is reported to have been minor by comparison to the Black Death,some fascinating details have been found from contemporary writings, includingthose of notable authors Daniel Defoe and Samuel Pepys, both of whom livedduring the period in which it occurred.The following extract from The Diary of Samuel Pepys, dated 24th December 1664,states that he,> “…saw the Comet, which is now, whether worn away or no I know not, but appears> not with a tail, but only is larger and duller than any other star…”The episode of ‘plague’ that affected England, and especially London, occurredin June 1665, and therefore only a few months after the sighting of the comet.This is also described by Daniel Defoe, who, in his novel entitled A Journal ofthe Plague Year, wrote that,> “In the first place, a blazing Star, or Comet, appeared for several months> before the Plague…”The evidence from contemporary records as well as tree-ring and ice core datademonstrates the existence of a ‘corrupted atmosphere’ during the 14th century.The earthquakes and impact of comet debris provide credible explanations forthat corrupted atmosphere and for its ability to have permeated a significantportion of the planet. The toxic substances known to be associated with cometsand comet debris provide an extremely compelling explanation for the rapid onsetof severe respiratory problems, asphyxiation and death.The medical establishment theory about fleas infected with bacteria that werespread by small animals to humans is entirely unsupported by the evidence; thetheory that the Black Death, or any other epidemic of ‘plague’ can be caused bya bacterium is shown to be fatally flawed.TuberculosisThe establishment definition of tuberculosis refers to,> “an infectious disease caused by the bacillus Mycobacterium tuberculosis and> characterized by the formation of nodular lesions in the tissues.”Tuberculosis (TB) is another disease claimed to have a long history that datesback many millennia. Various documents from early periods of history containreferences to certain illnesses, the recorded symptoms of which are claimed todemonstrate a positive identification of tuberculosis. Some of the writingsrefer to tuberculosis by its alternative names, which include consumption andthe White Plague.Tuberculosis is primarily a pulmonary disease, as the definition states,> “In pulmonary tuberculosis...the bacillus is inhaled into the lungs where it> sets up a primary tubercle…”A tubercle is a ‘nodular lesion’ that is usually, but not always, associatedwith tuberculosis. However, no explanation is offered by the medicalestablishment for the mechanism by which bacteria are able to generatetubercles; nor is there an explanation for the mechanism by which they inducethe symptoms attributed to TB. According to the September 2018 WHO fact sheetentitled Tuberculosis, these symptoms include,> “…cough with sputum and blood at times, chest pains, weakness, weight loss,> fever and night sweats.”It is claimed that a number of ‘discoveries’ made by Dr Robert Koch provided‘proof’ that certain bacteria were the causal agents of certain diseases. One ofhis most notable achievements is claimed to have been that in 1882 Dr Koch‘discovered’ the M. tuberculosis bacillus; it is reported that in the course ofhis experiments he had utilised newly-developed staining chemicals, which madethe bacteria more easily visible. It was for this ‘discovery’ of the bacillusthat he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1905.It is also claimed that the ‘infectious’ nature of TB had been proved prior toDr Koch’s discovery of the bacterium. That ‘proof’ is reported to have beendemonstrated by the injection of ‘tuberculous matter’ from human cadavers intolaboratory animals that subsequently became ‘infected’. It should be clear thatthese experiments are only able to ‘prove’ that the injection of noxious matterinto animals will cause them to become ill; they do not prove that illness is‘infectious’. More importantly, the manner in which people are said to be‘infected’ with TB is not through the injection of tuberculous matter into theirbodies; the definition claims that the bacteria are inhaled.The ‘proof’ that Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes TB is attributed to Dr Koch’sexperiments that involved the injection of ‘cultured’ bacilli into animals.These experiments are said to have produced the formation of ‘tubercles’, thepresence of which is claimed to provide the ‘proof’ that the bacteria heinjected into the animals were solely responsible for the formation of thetubercles. It is also claimed that the results of these experiments met thecriteria of his postulates.These claims are all highly problematic; however, the real problems they raiseare not due to Koch’s postulates but to the erroneous belief that ‘germs’ causedisease.The discussions in chapter three showed that no ‘germ’ conforms to the criteriaof the first postulate; a situation that Herbert Shelton explains in his bookabout syphilis,> “There is not a single germ that is held responsible for a single so-called> disease that fully meets a single one of these conditions…”Furthermore, in Orthopathy, Herbert Shelton refers to Dr Walter Hadwen’s 1921lecture, in which the latter quotes Dr Muthu, who was renowned for hisexperience with tuberculosis and had stated that tubercle bacilli were not foundin 50 per cent of cases. Dr Hadwen’s comment, which was cited in chapter three,also deserves repetition,> “Nobody has ever found a tubercle bacillus in the earliest stages of> tuberculosis.”The absence of the bacillus at the onset of disease demonstrates conclusivelythat it cannot be the causal agent.The main characteristics of tuberculosis are respiratory problems that resultfrom the alleged bacterial ‘infection’ of the lungs and produce symptoms thatenable the disease to be ‘spread’; as described by the WHO fact sheet thatstates,> “When people with lung TB cough, sneeze or spit, they propel the TB germs into> the air. A person needs to inhale only a few of these germs to become> infected.”The cough associated with TB usually results in the production of sputum, whichis one of the means by which a diagnosis can be made; as also described by thefact sheet,> “Many countries still rely on a long-used method called sputum smear> microscopy to diagnose TB.”The sputum samples are examined to detect the presence of bacteria and thencultured to determine the exact type of bacteria in the sample. These tests havenot always been successful in detecting the alleged ‘pathogen’, as related byNicholas Ashford and Dr Miller in Chemical Exposures,> “During the late nineteenth century, researchers collected sputum from> patients with tuberculosis but were unsuccessful in culturing any organism.”Dr Koch was one of those ‘researchers’ who is reported to have had difficultieswith culturing the bacteria; however, an appropriate culture medium waseventually discovered that proved to be useful, as further reported in ChemicalExposures,> “…the tubercle bacillus was fastidious and would grow out only after many> weeks on a specialized culture medium.”The nature of the ‘specialised culture medium’ is not specified, although theculture medium used by Dr Koch is reported to have been agar, which is derivedfrom algae and therefore not a natural constituent of the human body. Theassumption that the ability to ‘grow’ the bacteria demonstrates theirpathogenicity is highly flawed; it fails to recognise the phenomenon ofbacterial pleomorphism.The bacterium alleged to be the cause of TB has been recognised to bepleomorphic; this recognition is indicated by a 2010 article entitledPleomorphic appearance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis that states,> “This organism exhibits extreme pleomorphism in certain circumstances…”Despite the scientific evidence, the medical establishment continues to deny theexistence of pleomorphism, except in certain limited circumstances. The mainconsequence of this refusal to fully recognise pleomorphism is the failure torecognise that the substances chosen for use as a culture medium will directlyinfluence the morphology of the bacteria under investigation.It should be clear that the ‘success’ attributed to Dr Koch’s experiments isunfounded. However, in addition to the anomalous situation in which the ‘germ’is absent from the bodies of people diagnosed with TB, is the further anomaly inwhich there is an absence of illness in people who are claimed to have been‘infected’ by the ‘TB germ’. The WHO fact sheet claims that,> “People infected with TB bacteria have a 5-15% lifetime risk of falling ill> with TB.”The discussion about bacteria in chapter three referred to ‘asymptomaticcarriers’ and to ‘latent infection’, both of which refer to ‘infection’ in theabsence of illness. However, asymptomatic carriers are deemed to be able totransmit the bacteria, and therefore the disease, whereas those with latentinfection are claimed not to be able to do so. This is highly anomalous; yet themedical establishment fails to offer an explanation for their claim that abacterial ‘infection’ can have two entirely different outcomes. It should beobvious that, if TB bacteria were ‘pathogens’, they should always cause diseaseand that, if TB were an ‘infectious disease’, it should always be transmissible.These anomalies and contradictory statements invalidate the claims made aboutthe infectiousness and transmissibility of the TB ‘germ’; nevertheless, the factsheet makes an extravagant claim, which is that,> “About one-quarter of the world’s population has latent TB, which means people> have been infected by TB bacteria but are not (yet) ill with the disease and> cannot transmit the disease.”The use of the word ‘yet’ is intended to suggest that illness with TB isinevitable, but this suggestion is in complete contrast to the claim that, in 85to 95 per cent of cases, people ‘infected’ with TB bacteria do not developtuberculosis.For those people who do become ill, it is claimed that the TB bacteria hadchanged their status from ‘latent’ to ‘active’; but, yet again, no explanationis offered for the mechanism by which this change of status occurs.Nevertheless, ‘active TB’ is regarded as synonymous with ‘disease’, for whichthe medical establishment offers ‘treatment’, which inevitably takes the form ofantibiotics, as indicated by the fact sheet that states,> “Active, drug-susceptible TB disease is treated with a standard 6 month course> of 4 antimicrobial drugs…”The purpose of these drugs, as with all antibiotics, is to kill as many bacteriaas possible; the reasons for using multiple drugs are that they attack thebacteria in different ways and that they help to avoid ‘drug resistance’.Antibiotics for most ‘bacterial infections’ are usually prescribed for a shortperiod of approximately 7-10 days. A 6-month course of highly toxic drugs istherefore an extremely aggressive measure against the disease. These drastictreatment measures inevitably exacerbate the problem of antibiotic overuse; thefundamental problems with antibiotics and their dangerous consequences have beendiscussed.One of the main antibiotics used in the treatment of TB is isoniazid, some ofthe more minor ‘side effects’ of which include nausea, vomiting, stomach upset,constipation, dry mouth, fever, and skin reactions. Isoniazid is also associatedwith more serious effects that can include dizziness, inflammation of thenerves, psychotic episodes, blood disorders, raised blood sugar levels, andperipheral nerve damage. The most serious effect is severe and sometimes fatalliver damage, which is indicative of a systemic poisoning and a cleardemonstration that the drug is highly toxic. These effects, which pose a seriousthreat to health, are considered to be ‘worthwhile’ risks to take in the effortto control the spread of TB ‘infection’, despite the low percentage of people‘at risk’ of developing the disease.The drive to ‘eradicate TB’ includes the recommendation that treatment should beextended to people diagnosed with ‘latent TB’. Based on the WHO claim that thisgroup represents about one quarter of the world population, currently estimatedto be approximately 7 and a half billion, the manufacture of antibiotics foralmost 2 billion people would provide the pharmaceutical industry with aphenomenal boost to their profits. More importantly, however, it would create amajor tragedy of inestimable proportions for the people who receive these toxictreatments.The discussion in the previous chapter showed that the overuse of antibiotics isclaimed to be the cause of a loss of drug effectiveness, because bacteria havedeveloped ‘drug resistance’. The problem of ‘resistance’ is also associated withthe drugs used as treatments for TB and has led to the creation of an allegedlynew ‘form’ of the disease, called multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), which isdescribed by the fact sheet as,> “…a form of TB caused by bacteria that do not respond to isoniazid and> rifampicin, the 2 most powerful, first-line anti-TB drugs.”The ‘side effects’ of rifampicin are reported to include nausea, vomiting,headache, drowsiness and dizziness.As discussed, the real effect in the body from antibiotics is an increased levelof activity in the effort to eliminate substances the body recognises as toxic.The increased activity occurs mainly in the endocrine glands but, if theantibiotics are ingested, effects can also be produced in the digestive system,as demonstrated by the ‘side effects’ of both isoniazid and rifampicin thatinclude nausea and vomiting.This increased level of activity within the body may succeed in achieving areduction in intensity or even the cessation of symptoms; a result that is oftenmistakenly credited as being due to the action of the drugs. However, thecontinuation of any antibiotic drug ‘treatment’ over a long period of time willgradually exhaust the endocrine glands, damage the digestive system and create anumber of serious health problems, which are very likely those that areinterpreted as ‘drug resistance’. The rigid adherence of the medicalestablishment to the ‘germ theory’ means that the only solution available forpeople diagnosed with MDR-TB, is a further cocktail of even more toxic drugsthat will only exacerbate their existing health problems.Antibiotics are the main, but not the only, method by which the medicalestablishment attempts to control TB; they have also developed a vaccine, knownas the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, which is claimed to provideprotection against TB. Many, but not all, countries include this vaccine intheir standard infant immunisation schedule. One notable exception is the US; asituation that is extremely surprising considering the fervour with whichvaccines are normally promoted in that country; the CDC explains on theirwebsite that the reason for this policy is because,> “BCG does not always protect people from getting TB.”The poor level of efficacy of the BCG vaccine is also recognised by the UK NHSon a page entitled Who should have the BCG (TB) vaccine? that states,> “There's no evidence the BCG vaccine works for people over the age of 35.”It has however, been proven that the BCG vaccine is ineffective for all agegroups. This was demonstrated by a large field trial to test the vaccineconducted between the years 1968 and 1971 by the WHO in India; a country inwhich TB was, and still is, regarded as endemic. In one area comprising 309villages, about 364,000 people were vaccinated against TB, whilst people inanother area of roughly the same size remained unvaccinated. The resultshowever, caused the vaccination ‘experts’ considerable concern, because morecases of TB occurred in the vaccinated area than in the unvaccinated area. Theincidence of TB in ‘developing’ countries is discussed further in chapter eight.Despite the recognition that the BCG vaccine is not always effective, it remainswidely used on the basis that TB is regarded as a major worldwide problem, asindicated by the WHO fact sheet that states,> “Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide.”The fact sheet also provides statistics of worldwide morbidity and mortalityfrom TB,> “In 2017, 10 million people fell ill with TB and 1.6 million died from the> disease.”Although TB is considered to be a serious disease, the vast majority of peoplesurvive, because, according to the fact sheet,> “TB is a treatable and curable disease.”This claim cannot be substantiated; the treatments that are used do not cure TB.The reason that treatments fail to cure TB is due to a lack of understandingabout the functions of the human body and its self-regulating mechanisms.Previous discussions have referred to the liver as one of the main organs thateliminate toxins; the kidneys also perform a similar function. If either ofthese organs becomes congested and unable to work efficiently, toxins can buildup in the body and the blood; a situation that would be extremely dangerous andpotentially fatal. Fortunately, the body’s self-regulating mechanisms includeother organs that provide assistance in the processes of elimination; thisassistance is called ‘vicarious elimination’ as explained by Dr Henry Bieler inFood is Your Best Medicine,> “Toxic blood must discharge its toxins or the person dies, so nature uses> substitutes. The lungs and skin help the kidneys and liver respectively.”He expands on the function performed by the lungs and states,> “From the irritation caused by the elimination of poison through this> vicarious channel, we get bronchitis, pneumonia or tuberculosis, as is> determined by the particular chemistry of the poison being eliminated.”The ‘poisons’ that require elimination can include substances consumed withinthe diet; for example, chemical food additives that are used in the manufactureof processed food products consumed by a large proportion of the worldpopulation. As the discussions in chapter six will demonstrate, most foodadditives are toxic. The greater the intake of these toxic substances, thegreater will be the body’s efforts to eliminate them. Dr John Tilden explainsthe connection between tuberculosis and all of the factors that may constitutewhat he refers to as a ‘faulty diet’,> “I recognize the disease as coming from perverted nutrition brought on from> crowded digestion…”TB is not necessarily the result of ‘crowded digestion’ due to over-eating; itcan be due to the accumulation of substances, such as food additives, that thebody regards as ‘toxins’ but may not be easily able to eliminate. This may beone reason that certain so-called ‘developed’ countries are reporting increasesin the incidence of TB. However, TB also occurs in conjunction with poor livingconditions, poverty and malnutrition; this is an indication that ‘crowdeddigestion’ is not the only factor that contributes to the disease.Unfortunately, the preoccupation with the ‘germ theory’ means that, instead ofaddressing the real problems that cause tuberculosis, the medical establishmentconcentrates on the use of toxic drugs and vaccines, both of which exacerbateillness.A matter of increasing concern with respect to TB is that, according to one ofthe key ‘facts’ in the WHO fact sheet, a strong association exists between TBand HIV, which is the subject of the next discussion. The fact sheet claimsthat,> “HIV and TB form a lethal combination, each speeding the other’s progress.”As the following discussion will demonstrate; yet again, nothing could befurther from the truth.HIV/AIDSThe establishment definition of AIDS refers to,> “a syndrome first identified in Los Angeles in 1981; a description of the> causative virus – the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) – was available in> 1983.”The definition also states that,> “AIDS is essentially a sexually transmitted disease…”The mainstream media reports during the early 1980s about a new disease calledAIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) were highly dramatic. They gave theimpression that the world was on the verge of a new and deadly ‘plague’ thatthreatened to decimate the global population, and that anyone who contractedthis disease was doomed to suffer horribly and die. This new ‘plague’ seemed tohave the potential to rival the Black Death and the 1918 Flu and be destined tobecome one of the most deadly scourges humankind had ever faced.The media reports made a number of claims, which were: that ‘infection’ with thevirus could not be cured; that progression to ‘full-blown AIDS’ would occur foran exceptionally high proportion of people infected with the virus; that therewas no cure for AIDS; and that once a patient had progressed to AIDS they wouldbecome seriously ill and succumb very quickly to an early death.These predictions of impending doom were not fulfilled. The fact that this‘deadly plague’ failed to materialise prompted a revision to the medicalestablishment definition of AIDS, which states,> “Until recently, AIDS has been considered to be universally fatal, although> the type and length of illness preceding death varies considerably.”Although less deadly than first predicted, ‘infection’ with the ‘virus’ calledHIV is still regarded as a serious health problem, as indicated by the July 2018WHO fact sheet entitled HIV/AIDS that claims,> “HIV continues to be a major global public health issue, having claimed more> than 35 million lives so far.”Yet again, nothing could be further from the truth.The claims made by the medical establishment about the virus called HIV and thesyndrome called AIDS are erroneous; not only because they are based on erroneousnotions about ‘germs’ and ‘infectious diseases’, but also because they are basedon fallacies; as this discussion will demonstrate.The discovery of ‘AIDS’ began in 1981 when a number of men in the San Franciscoarea were diagnosed with two relatively rare diseases, Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS), atype of cancer, and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP). Although rare, KS andPCP were not new diseases, nor were either of them claimed to be caused by avirus; nevertheless, they became the first ‘AIDS-defining’ diseases.The early research into these cases, which represented an abnormally highincidence of two otherwise rare diseases, indicated that they occurred almostexclusively within two ‘risk groups’, one of which comprised gay men with anextremely active sex-life. Their sexual activities, the details of which areunnecessary for this discussion, were often accompanied by the use of ‘poppers’and antibiotics.‘Poppers’ are a type of drug that is inhaled; they are made from alkyl nitrites,which are a group of chemical compounds that can be metabolised within the bodyto form nitrosamines, most types of which are recognised carcinogens. An articleentitled AIDS and Poppers on the Virus Myth website (virusmyth.com) explains theconnection,> “Kaposi’s is a blood vessel tumor, and nitrites act on blood vessels.”The article states that the majority of the early cases of KS were gay men whoregularly inhaled ‘poppers’ and had done so for a significant period of time.The previous discussion about TB referred to the lungs as a ‘vicarious channel’for the elimination of toxins; the inhalation of toxic nitrites will causedamage to the respiratory system, including the lungs. The long-term toxicirritation of the lungs will produce a variety of symptoms that could also leadto a diagnosis of either pneumonia or PCP.Although antibiotics were often taken as treatments for existing ‘infections’,they were also taken prophylactically over a significant period of time. Theadverse health effects from the long-term use of antibiotics have beendiscussed.The other main ‘risk group’ comprised drug addicts, most of whom wereintravenous drug users; the adverse health effects from the injection of toxicsubstances into the bloodstream have been discussed in connection withvaccinations; the injection of toxic ‘illegal’ drugs will also produce seriousadverse health effects.It should be noted that many drugs now categorised as ‘illegal’ were originallymanufactured by the pharmaceutical industry for use as ‘medicines’. Aspreviously discussed, many pharmaceutical medicines have been synthesised fromthe ‘active ingredients’ of plants; for example, morphine, a legal drug, isderived from the opium poppy, from which heroin, an illegal drug, althoughoriginally a legal one, is also derived.It is clear that the first patients diagnosed with ‘AIDS’ were long-termconsumers of a substantial quantity of toxic drugs, whether nitrites,antibiotics or ‘recreational’ drugs. The clinicians and researchers who studiedthese early cases soon developed a hypothesis that ‘AIDS’ was a toxicologicalhealth problem. This point is extremely significant as it offers a compellingexplanation for the serious health problems suffered by these patients; it is,however, a point that was, and remains conspicuous by its absence from thereports of the mainstream media that only refer to the medical establishmentdogma that ‘HIV causes AIDS’.In 1997 Dr Peter Duesberg PhD and Dr David Rasnick PhD co-authored an articleentitled The Drugs-AIDS Hypothesis, published on the Virus Myth website; intheir article they explain that the drugs used by the first AIDS patients wereinherently toxic and that,> “Drug toxicity provides chemically plausible causes of disease.”Unfortunately, any research into the toxicological aspects of ‘AIDS’ wasabruptly curtailed on 23rd April 1984 when, at a press conference in the US, itwas announced by the HHS that,> “the probable cause of AIDS has been found.”It was claimed that the cause was a ‘virus’; or, to be more precise a‘retrovirus’. Although initially labelled ‘HTLV-III’, this virus was eventuallyto become known as ‘HIV’ (human immunodeficiency virus).At the press conference, it was also announced that a vaccine would be availablein about 2 years; a claim that, more than 3 decades later, has yet to berealised, although there are a number of ongoing projects that continue theeffort to develop a vaccine.The ‘hero’ of the day also appeared at the press conference; namely, Dr RobertGallo, a virologist and the alleged ‘discoverer’ of the virus. At the time ofhis ‘discovery’ he was working at the US NIH (National Institutes of Health)where he studied possible connections between retroviruses and cancer.In addition to the American research, a viral cause of AIDS was also underinvestigation by French scientists, most notably Dr Luc Montagnier and DrFrancoise Barré-Sinoussi, both of whom would later be awarded the Nobel Prizefor their ‘discovery’ of the virus.The announcement of the ‘viral’ cause of AIDS had significant consequences, themost important of which was that ‘AIDS research’ became focused solely onstudies that followed the viral hypothesis. It is only research of this naturethat has received any substantial level of funding since 1984, despite the veryclear evidence of toxicological causes of ‘AIDS’. Over the course of more thanthree decades, the funding of AIDS research based on the viral hypothesis hasamounted to many hundreds of billions of dollars. The US budget for the year2019 for the ‘domestic funding of HIV’ was reported on the US Government websiteto be a little over $28 billion.Another significant circumstance, and one that has had profound consequences, isthat, on the day of the press conference, Dr Gallo filed an application for apatent on a ‘test’ that was said to be able to determine whether a person hadbeen ‘infected’ by the virus.The most astounding fact is that, despite the press conference announcement andDr Gallo’s patent application for a diagnostic test, the viral hypothesis hadyet to undergo the usual scientific validation procedures. On the day of thepress conference, no original scientific papers that proved the hypothesis thatthe virus was the cause of AIDS had been published in any peer reviewed journal.This was unprecedented in ‘science’; as Dr Peter Duesberg explains in Inventingthe AIDS Virus,> “Science by press conference was substituted for the conventional processes of> scientific validation, which is based on publications in the professional> literature.”Although there are significant problems with the ‘peer review’ process, as willbe discussed in chapter nine, it was a serious breach of scientific conventionto call a press conference and announce a scientific ‘discovery’, prior to thescientific community having the opportunity to review the research study, testits results and evaluate its conclusions. The relevant study papers werepublished soon afterwards; however, as will be demonstrated, they failed toprovide actual ‘proof’ to support the viral hypothesis that had been claimed atthe press conference.One of the main problems is that, even within the dogma of the ‘germ theory’,the viral hypothesis for ‘AIDS’ was illogical; the two original ‘AIDS-defining’diseases were not claimed to be caused by viruses. Unfortunately, this point wasoverlooked by the majority of scientists who accepted the viral hypothesis asannounced at the press conference.There is, however, a large and growing group of scientists whose views differfrom the medical establishment dogma about the viral hypothesis of AIDS. One ofthese scientists is Dr Peter Duesberg, who, at the time of the press conference,was also studying retroviruses in connection with cancer, and thereforeeminently qualified to assess the claims made by Dr Gallo. Dr Duesberg knew fromhis own research that, as a retrovirus, HIV should not be able to kill the cellsit ‘infected’.Dr Duesberg’s view was, and still is, that HIV is largely a ‘harmless passengervirus’ and that AIDS cannot be caused by an infectious agent. Based on his yearsof research, he maintains the view that the cause is far more likely to betoxicological, as indicated by his 1997 co-authored article previously cited.His view also supports that of the clinicians and researchers who examined manyof the first AIDS patients during the early 1980s.In 1987, Dr Duesberg wrote an article that was published in the prestigiousjournal Cancer Research. In this article, he refuted the prevailing HIV/AIDShypothesis; however, it caused a strong reaction from the medical establishmentthat had wholeheartedly accepted and believed in the viral hypothesis. As aresult, Dr Duesberg was virtually ostracised by the orthodox scientificcommunity; he was also denied the renewal of his research grant. Nevertheless,Dr Duesberg maintains his view that the retrovirus particle called ‘HIV’ is partof normal human body functioning and harmless; and, as such, it cannot cause anydisease let alone the allegedly deadly disease known as ‘AIDS’.Amongst the many thousands of scientists who refute the ‘HIV causes AIDS’ dogmais Dr Kary Mullis PhD, the recipient of the 1993 Nobel Prize for his inventionof the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Dr Mullis’ refutation of the orthodoxtheory was the result of his research during 1988 whilst he was engaged by theNIH to set up analyses for HIV testing. During the course of this work, heneeded to cite the original research papers that contained the ‘proof’ that HIVcaused AIDS. However, he was unable to find any such papers; as he has explainedin his interviews with the London Sunday Times and with Spin Magazine. On thehome page of the Virus Myth website is the statement made by Dr Mullis in 1993that,> “If there is evidence that HIV causes AIDS, there should be scientific> documents which either singly or collectively demonstrate that fact, at least> with a high probability. There is no such document.”In the Foreword he wrote for Inventing the AIDS Virus, Dr Mullis states that,according to his research,> “No one had ever proved that HIV causes AIDS.”Nothing has occurred in the intervening decades to alter this fact; there isstill no scientific proof that a virus called ‘HIV’ causes the illness referredto as ‘AIDS’.The scientific papers produced by Gallo and his colleagues that were finallypublished in May 1984 in the journal Science, have been found to onlydemonstrate a weak correlation of the ‘virus’ with AIDS patients. Whatever thesepapers contained; they clearly did not provide the unequivocal ‘proof’ that HIVcauses AIDS; otherwise Dr Mullis would have acknowledged their existence.In Inventing the AIDS Virus, which was published in 1996 and therefore more thana decade after the press conference announcement, Dr Duesberg referred to thecontinuing absence of any evidence that AIDS was, or could be, a deadlyinfectious disease,> “Despite projections of wild spread, HIV infection has remained virtually> constant throughout the industrialized world ever since it could be tested in> 1985, whether in the United States or Europe; the estimated incubation period> between infection and disease has been revised from ten months to more than> ten years; and the predicted heterosexual explosion has failed to> materialize.”A substantial increase in the incubation period is not the only revision to theorthodox AIDS theory; there have been many, including a substantial expansion ofthe conditions that are regarded as ‘AIDS-defining’. According to the CDC, theconditions also include cervical cancer, tuberculosis and a number of ‘bacterialinfections’. PCP has also undergone a slight change in its definition; it is nowclaimed to be caused by a yeast-like fungus called Pneumonia joveci.It is clear that many of the ‘AIDS-defining’ conditions listed by the CDC arenot viral diseases; which contradicts the claim that a virus called ‘HIV’ is thecause of ‘AIDS’; the original theory has also undergone a revision. Theexplanation offered for the classification of non-viral diseases as‘AIDS-defining’ is that ‘HIV’ weakens the immune system and that this weaknesspermits an ‘opportunistic infection’ (OI) caused by another ‘germ’. According toa page entitled Opportunistic Infections on the CDC website,> “Opportunistic infections (OIs) are infections that occur more frequently and> are more severe in individuals with weakened immune systems, including people> with HIV.”This point is of particular significance for TB, as indicated by the WHO TB factsheet that states,> “TB is a leading killer of HIV-positive people.”The WHO HIV/AIDS fact sheet claims that TB is,> “…responsible for more than 1 of 3 HIV-associated deaths.”These claims are highly anomalous; the majority of TB cases are claimed to occurin India, whereas the majority of HIV/AIDS cases are claimed to occur inSub-Saharan Africa.The orthodox theory of HIV/AIDS would seem to have been revised, as indicated bythe CDC web page about opportunistic infections that states,> “When a person living with HIV gets certain infections (called opportunistic> infections, or OIs), he or she will get a diagnosis of AIDS, the most serious> stage of HIV infection.”It is clear therefore that HIV is no longer regarded as the sole cause of AIDS.A diagnosis of ‘AIDS’ does however require confirmation of the presence of‘HIV’, which is alleged to be detectable by a test, as indicated by the factsheet that claims,> “HIV infection is often diagnosed through rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), which> detect the presence or absence of HIV antibodies.”The discussion in the first section of this chapter explained that the presenceof antibodies is interpreted in two completely different and mutually exclusiveways. One interpretation is that antibodies indicate ‘protection’; the other isthat they indicate ‘infection’. The presence of ‘HIV’ antibodies as detected byHIV tests is interpreted to indicate ‘infection’.The discussion about syphilis explained that the Wassermann test was unable toidentify antibodies specific to the ‘germ’ alleged to cause syphilis; the sameis true of the HIV test. Antibodies are proteins, certain types of which aredeemed to be specific to each ‘pathogen’. Some of the proteins deemed specificto ‘HIV’ include those labelled p24 and p41. However, in his article entitledHIV Tests Are Not HIV Tests, Professor Henry Bauer PhD states that,> “Far from being specific to HIV or AIDS patients...p24 and p41 are not even> specific to illness.”He makes the point quite clearly that HIV tests are not able to specificallyidentify ‘HIV antibodies’; furthermore, he comments that,> “Tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) do not detect HIV…”In another similarity with the Wassermann tests, ‘HIV tests’ can also produce‘positive’ results due to a number of other conditions; these are called ‘falsepositives’. One particularly significant example is that HIV tests can generate‘positive’ results for people with tuberculosis; although they are ‘falsepositives’ they provide one explanation for the allegedly close associationbetween TB and HIV. However, as Professor Bauer indicates in his article, the‘antibodies’ detected by the HIV tests are not even specific to illness.In a further similarity with the Wassermann test, the HIV test commonly produces‘false positives’ for pregnant women, for whom a positive HIV test result canhave very serious consequences, not only for herself but also for her baby; aswill be demonstrated. Other conditions that can produce false positive HIV testresults include leprosy, influenza and malaria. A number of vaccinations havealso been associated with false positive ‘HIV’ test results. The similaritiesbetween HIV and syphilis are indeed striking.The discussions about vaccination indicated that many, if not all of themcontain animal proteins; which may account for the detection by HIV tests of theexistence of certain abnormal proteins in the body that are mistakenly labelledas ‘antibodies’.There are clearly many fundamental problems with the tests that are used todetermine a person’s HIV status; yet these tests are used around the world, aswill be further discussed in chapter eight.Another revision to the HIV/AIDS dogma is the change in the descriptive label ofthis health problem from ‘AIDS’ to that of ‘HIV infection’, about which the WHOfact sheet states,> “There is no cure for HIV infection.”Despite the lack of a ‘cure’, there is the inevitable recommendation by the WHOthat ‘HIV infection’ requires ‘treatment’, as the fact sheet states,> “HIV can be suppressed by combination ART consisting of 3 or more ARV drugs.”The alleged mechanism of action of the drugs used in ART (antiretroviraltherapy) is also described,> “ART does not cure HIV infection but suppresses viral replication within a> person’s body…”There is no evidence that ‘viral replication’ is a disease-causing process;there is, however, a great deal of evidence that ART drugs are toxic, whichmeans that they are harmful to health.The treatments that are now used are different from those recommended during the1980s and early 1990s, although they are all based on the same principle ofsuppressing viral replication. The initial treatment for AIDS patients was AZT(azidothymidine), a drug that was originally developed in the 1960s to be atreatment for leukaemia. AZT is described as a DNA chain terminator, which meansthat it kills growing lymphocytes by termination of DNA synthesis. Lymphocytesare white blood cells.When AZT was first tested as a treatment for cancer, it failed to prolong thelives of leukemic animals and was therefore rejected as a suitable treatment forhumans with leukaemia, or any other form of cancer. Most cancer chemotherapiesare administered as a short series of treatments, with rest periods in betweeneach course to allow the patient’s system to recover from the effects of thetoxic treatment.Conversely for AIDS patients, AZT treatments were to be taken for ‘life’, which,at the high doses that were initially prescribed, became extremely short. It isreported that everyone who received these high doses of toxic AZT died soonafter their course of ‘treatment’ had begun. However, although these people arereported to have died from ‘AIDS’, the real cause of their deaths was the highlytoxic AZT treatment. This is confirmed by Professor Bauer who states on hiswebsite The Case Against HIV, under the sub-heading, What Antiretroviral DrugsDo, that,> “AZT actually killed about 150,000 ‘HIV-positive’ people between the mid-1980s> and the mid 1990s.”The combination drugs that are currently used do not cause death quite sorapidly; although AZT is still an ingredient of ART drugs, the dose is muchsmaller. This should not be interpreted to mean that it is ‘the dose’ that makes‘the poison’; the important point to be emphasised is that the size of ‘thedose’ determines the intensity of the effect; large amounts of a poison willcause very serious effects very quickly. Smaller doses over the course of a longperiod of time will also cause serious effects; but the effects will take agreater period of time to become noticeable.One of the most tragic consequences of the belief that ‘HIV’ is a deadly virus,is that ‘treatment’ with highly toxic drugs can be administered to babies, themost vulnerable members of the human population. As previously mentioned,pregnancy is one of the ‘conditions’ that may produce a ‘false positive’ HIVtest result. This result, even though false, is interpreted to indicate thepresence of a deadly virus that endangers the lives of both mother and baby. Theresult of the erroneous idea that ‘HIV’ can be transmitted by an ‘infected’mother to her baby during pregnancy, is that an expectant mother with a‘positive’ HIV test result will be ‘treated’ with toxic ART drugs and the babywill be treated almost immediately after birth.The recommendations for pregnant women in the US are explained on the pageentitled Management of Infants Born to Women with HIV Infection on the AIDS Infowebsite, which states that,> “All newborns perinatally exposed to HIV should receive postpartum> antiretroviral (ARV) drugs to reduce the risk of perinatal transmission of> HIV.”One of the antiretroviral drugs recommended for newborn babies is zidovudine,also known as azidothymidine; in other words, AZT.This is another situation in which the word ‘tragic’ is woefully inadequate!It is clear that the pharmaceutical industry is a major beneficiary of thesetreatment recommendations; as demonstrated by the WHO fact sheet, which claimsthat,> “In 2017, 21.7 million people living with HIV were receiving ART globally.”This level of drug coverage is to be further increased, as the fact sheetstates,> “Expanding access to treatment is at the heart of a set of targets for 2020> which aim to bring the world on track to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030.”The extension of this policy to all countries around the world, especially thosedescribed as ‘developing’, is discussed in further detail in chapter eight;however, it should be abundantly clear that the ingestion of toxic drugs doesnot save lives.Another group of scientists, led by biophysicist Dr Eleni Papadopulos-EleopulosPhD from the Royal Perth Hospital in Australia, has also refuted theestablishment dogma that HIV causes AIDS since the beginning of the alleged‘epidemic’ in the early 1980s. Their stance, which differs slightly from that ofDr Duesberg, is that HIV has never been proven to exist. The reason for makingthis claim is based on their study of the published scientific papers, which,they claim, fail to show that the ‘virus’ was ever isolated.The failure to perform this important step in viral research means that thestructure of the antibodies specific to HIV is unknown. This is clearly one ofthe reasons that the HIV ‘test’ is not a test for HIV and that it is notspecific to HIV antibodies. The work of the Perth Group in this field ofHIV/AIDS research is documented on their website (theperthgroup.com). The pointthey make is, however, an extremely important one as it indicates that theentire HIV/AIDS industry is based on a fallacy.In addition, the Perth Group states that diseases claimed to be ‘AIDS-defining’are largely produced as the result of oxidative stress, which is discussed by DrValendar Turner MD in his article entitled The Yin & Yang of HIV, that states,> “…when oxidation is prolonged or excessive, cells become abnormal, injured and> susceptible to diseases.”Oxidative stress results from an excess of free radicals that damage cells andtissues; it is a major factor in all conditions of illness, as will be discussedin later chapters, especially chapter ten.The significance of the reference to oxidative stress is that it is supportiveof the original view that ‘AIDS’ was essentially toxicological; that theconditions suffered by the patients first diagnosed with the ‘disease’ were theresult of a high intake of toxic drugs over a long period of time; toxicsubstances increase the production of free radicals and oxidative stress causesdamage to the cells, tissues and organs.Although Dr Duesberg maintains that the virus exists as a harmless passengervirus, his words are still pertinent,> “The only solution is to rethink the basic assumption that AIDS is infectious> and is caused by HIV. But the federal and industrial downpour of funding has> created an army of HIV-AIDS experts that includes scientists, journalists and> activists who cannot afford to question the direction of their crusade.”The AIDS establishment continues to steadfastly refuse to end their crusade orto relinquish their unproven notion that HIV is an infectious virus and thatAIDS is a fatal ‘disease’. But even more egregious is that the medicalestablishment vilifies the work of the thousands of scientists like Dr PeterDuesberg, Dr David Rasnick, Dr Eleni Papadopulos-Eleopulos and Dr Kary Mullis,who refute the orthodox theory and provide compelling explanations for theillnesses that are classified under the label of ‘AIDS’.Clearly, there is no specific illness that can be labelled ‘AIDS’; like so manyother conditions, there are many causes and most of them are toxicological.Although the ‘HIV’ test is meaningless, it is extremely dangerous; a positiveresult on this test leads to toxic drugs, illness and an early death. Yet thepublic has been propagandised with stories of a dangerous virus and the deadlydisease syndrome that it causes. The vast majority of people have accepted thesestories and believe in the notion that the drugs are ‘life-saving’ when, inreality, they are life-threatening.The story of HIV/AIDS is one that is fraught with bad science, politics,egotists, changed definitions, destroyed careers, greed and fraud. Although thismay sound like an exaggerated claim these adjectives have been chosen carefullyand used correctly; as will be discussed in more detail in chapter nine.◆◆◆ The claim promulgated by the medical establishment that the human race is inmortal danger from ‘infectious diseases’ caused by deadly ‘germs’ has been shownto be unfounded.The consequences for people are, however, extremely serious, because themeasures used for the prevention and treatment of these ‘diseases’ have theability to severely impair their health and endanger their lives. Thesemeasures, which are inherently toxic, will only continue to produce ever-greaternumbers of victims of iatrogenesis.The real causes of so-called ‘infectious diseases’ are not ‘germs’, they are farmore closely associated with environmental pollutants; as the discussions inchapters six and ten will demonstrate."},{"pageContent":"> 5. Animals & Diseases: More Medical Myths> “Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities”> Voltaire The establishment definition of the term ‘zoonosis’ refers to,> “an infectious disease of animals that can be transmitted to humans.”The significance of zoonoses is that, according to the WHO web page entitledManaging public health risks at the human-animal-environment interface,> “Zoonoses comprise a large percentage of all newly identified infectious> diseases as well as existing infectious diseases.”In an effort to address the problems due to zoonoses, the WHO has partnered withthe OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) and the FAO (Food and AgricultureOrganization) to form a collaboration, which, in April 2010, produced a documentthat reports the ‘vision’ of this partnership to be,> “A world capable of preventing, detecting, containing, eliminating and> responding to animal and public health risks attributable to zoonoses and> animal diseases with an impact on food security through multi-sectoral> cooperation and strong partnerships.”The causal agents of zoonoses are claimed to be mainly bacteria, viruses andparasites, although of different species from those claimed to cause ‘infectiousdiseases’ exclusive to humans; fungi are not considered to be significant causesof zoonoses. However, as demonstrated by the discussions in the two previouschapters, bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi are not pathogens, they do notcause human ‘infectious diseases’; this means therefore, that they cannot be thecausal agents of ‘infectious diseases of animals’, whether zoonotic ornon-zoonotic.On the basis of the erroneous belief that ‘germs’ do cause zoonoses, themeasures employed to address them are very similar to, if not the same as, thoseemployed to address human infectious diseases. These measures, which were shownto be harmful to humans, will inevitably be harmful to animals. In addition,there are serious ramifications for human health, as a result of the harmfulmeasures employed directly in the treatment of animals destined for the humanfood chain.Although the FAO-OIE-WHO document does not discuss the recommendations indetail, it claims to ensure ‘food security’ through the prevention of‘food-borne pathogens’. It is clear that this is intended to refer to the use ofchemical compounds that are inevitably toxic by nature because their intendedpurpose is to kill the pathogens. However, food is not made ‘safe’ by theaddition of toxic, antimicrobial chemicals; as will be discussed in greaterdetail in chapter six.It is therefore extremely important to expose the serious and far-reachingconsequences of the rigid adherence to the ‘germ theory’ with respect to animal‘infectious diseases’ and the measures employed to combat them.It is claimed that zoonoses are transmitted in a number of ways, one of which isthrough direct contact, an animal bite, for example; another method oftransmission is said to occur through the air via ‘infected droplets’. It isalso claimed that the ‘pathogens’ can be transmitted via a ‘vector’ or‘carrier’. A vector is usually an insect that carries and is therefore able totransmit a ‘parasite’; the most common vectors are mosquitoes, many species ofwhich are claimed to carry various parasites said to be the causes of a numberof diseases. The best-known example of a ‘vector-borne’ disease is malaria,which is discussed in more detail in chapter eight.Like human ‘infectious diseases’, each zoonosis is said to be caused by adistinct species of pathogen; however, unlike human pathogens, animal pathogensare said to have the ability to infect more than one host; as indicated by a2002 article entitled Identifying Reservoirs of Infection: A Conceptual andPractical Challenge, which states that,> “…77% of livestock pathogens and 91% of domestic carnivore pathogens infect> multiple hosts.”The term ‘reservoir host’ refers to an animal that is claimed to harbour and bethe natural ‘home’ of a particular pathogen. Some sources claim that ‘reservoirhosts’ do not succumb to the disease the pathogen is alleged to cause, eventhough they are said to transmit infection; these animal ‘reservoir hosts’ aretherefore comparable to human ‘asymptomatic carriers’. It is clear however,that, like the theories about human ‘infectious diseases’, the theories aboutanimal diseases contain many anomalies and contradictions; they are alsosimilarly erroneous.An erroneous theory of disease causation inevitably generates a flawed theory ofdisease eradication; a situation that clearly applies to all so-called‘infectious diseases’. However, according to a 2008 article entitled Zoonoses –With Friends Like This, Who Needs Enemies, only infectious diseases thatexclusively affect humans are capable of eradication on the basis that it isonly possible to achieve adequate vaccination coverage of the human population.The existence of multiple animal ‘reservoir hosts’ is said to make theeradication of zoonoses much more difficult, as the article states,> “…zoonotic infections (those that have an animal reservoir) can probably never> be eradicated…”This idea clearly applies to all animal diseases, but is disproven by claimsabout the ‘eradication’ in 2011 of rinderpest, which, although non-zoonotic, isa disease that was reported to have affected many different animals, bothdomestic and wild; it is the only animal disease claimed to have beeneradicated.Although the eradication of smallpox and rinderpest are widely acclaimed asrepresenting major ‘successes’ in the fight against disease, many hundreds of‘infectious diseases’ are said to exist; the eradication of only two of themcannot be regarded as a cause for celebration. On the contrary, these alleged‘successes’ must be contrasted with the many reports that suggest the number ofinfectious diseases is increasing, rather than decreasing; a point that isdemonstrated by a 2014 article entitled Emerging zoonotic viral diseases, whichstates that,> “The last 30 years have seen a rise in emerging infectious diseases in humans> and of these over 70% are zoonotic.”The failure to successfully control the increasing incidence of ‘infectiousdiseases’ is largely due to the incessant search for ‘pathogens’ to theexclusion of almost any other factors that may cause or contribute to illness.The result of this focus on ‘germs’ has been the alleged ‘discovery’ of vastnumbers of so-called ‘pathogens’, as described in a 2001 article entitled Riskfactors for human disease emergence that states,> “A comprehensive literature review identifies 1415 species of infectious> organism known to be pathogenic to humans…”The article adds the comment that,> “The majority of pathogen species causing disease in humans are zoonotic…”As mentioned above, the measures employed to combat animal ‘diseases’ includethe use of pharmaceutical drugs and vaccines, both of which adversely affect thehealth of animals, including those reared for human consumption. The vaccinationschedule for some animals is similar to that for humans, as indicated by thepage entitled Badgers on the website of The Wildlife Trusts, which states that,> “Cattle are already vaccinated for up to 16 diseases…”The implications for human health from the consumption of meat from vaccinatedanimals are, however, poorly understood; as acknowledged by a 2003 articleentitled Human Illness Associated with Use of Veterinary Vaccines, which statesthat,> “The extent to which veterinary vaccines pose a health hazard to humans is> unclear.”Unfortunately, the article regards the main human health hazard to be fromexposure to the ‘germs’ contained within animal vaccines, rather than theirtoxic ingredients. Although the human body is able to process and excreteingested toxins through the digestive system, the level of toxins consumed fromthe meat of vaccinated animals is poorly recognised and rarely studied due tothe belief that vaccines are ‘safe’.The pharmaceuticals used in animal husbandry include antibiotics and growthhormones; although the latter are obviously not used to combat ‘germs’. However,the safety of the drugs administered to animals reared for human consumption hasnot been conclusively established. A 2010 article entitled Risk Assessment ofGrowth Hormones and Antimicrobial Residues in Meat acknowledges that the use ofthese drugs has,> “…provoked much debate on the safety of livestock products for human> consumption.”In order to determine the correct ‘dose’, the risk assessment procedures forveterinary drugs require the setting of ADIs (Acceptable Daily Intakes) and MRLs(Maximum Residue Limits). The problem with these ‘safety’ procedures is thatthey only assess the ‘dose’ of each substance individually. The claim that thereis a ‘safe’ dose of each individual substance ignores the fact that manydifferent veterinary drugs and vaccines are used; it also fails to recognise thesynergies that may occur from interactions between drugs and vaccines used invarious combinations.Animals reared for food are subjected to a wide variety of ‘treatments’ that areclaimed to assure their ‘safety’ for human consumption, but, in reality, thesetreatments achieve the complete opposite; they cause a great deal of harm. Thearticle refers to the use of growth hormones and states that,> “The hormonal substances used for growth promotion in cattle are the naturally> occurring steroids…”The substances produced by the pharmaceutical industry, whether preparationsderived from natural hormones or completely synthesised substances, are notequivalent to hormones that are produced naturally by an animal. Althoughreferred to as ‘naturally-occurring’, that does not mean these hormonalsubstances are ‘safe’ or that specific hormones only produce a single specificeffect within the animal’s body. The article claims that these ‘hormonalsubstances’ have a negligible impact on human health, but a ‘negligible impact’is not equivalent to ‘no impact’. The use of hormonal substances in animalsreared for food is discussed in a 2015 article entitled Hormone Use in FoodAnimal Production: Assessing Potential Dietary Exposures and Breast Cancer Risk,which refers to hormone drugs approved by the FDA for use in food animals andstates that,> “There is concern that these drugs or their biologically active metabolites> may accumulate in edible tissues…”Although these drugs are claimed to have a ‘negligible impact’ on human health,this has not, however, been fully established; as the article also states,> “To date, the potential for human exposure to residues of these compounds in> animal products, as well as the risks that may result from this exposure, is> poorly understood.”The previously cited 2010 Risk Assessment article refers to the use of‘antimicrobials’; however, although bacteria are not the only zoonotic pathogen,antibiotics are one of the most commonly used drugs in animal husbandry.Significantly, their use for animals is on a scale that positively dwarfs theiruse in the treatment of human ‘infections’.Furthermore, the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry is not limited to thetreatment of ‘infections’; as indicated by a 2012 article entitled A Review ofAntibiotic Use in Food Animals: Perspective, Policy and Potential, which statesthat they are used,> “…to treat clinical disease, to prevent and control common disease events, and> to enhance animal growth.”The article acknowledges the widespread use of antibiotics for animals rearedfor human consumption; however, although it may be assumed that this means therehave been extensive studies performed to evaluate and determine the safety andefficacy of these drugs, the article indicates otherwise,> “Furthermore, in existing studies, neither the risks to human health nor the> benefits to animal production have been well studied.”Nevertheless, despite the lack of adequate studies, animal husbandry involves awide variety of antibiotics, as the article also indicates,> “Twelve classes of antimicrobials – arsenicals, polypeptides, glycolipids,> tetracyclines, elfamycins, macrolides, lincosamides, polyethers, betalactams,> quinoxalines, streptogramins, and sulfonamides – may be used at different> times in the life cycle of poultry, cattle and swine.”This huge volume of antibiotic drugs, all of which are toxic by nature, as wellas by intention, is virtually ignored in the reports issued by the medicalestablishment on matters of animal health. Instead, it is invariably claimedthat the main problem posed by the overuse of antibiotics is ‘drug-resistance’;a claim that is also made on the WHO web page about ‘managing public healththreats’, which states that,> “Antimicrobial resistance in human pathogens is another major public health> threat which is partly impacted by use of antibiotics in animal husbandry and> agriculture.”The real problem caused by the overuse of antibiotics has been discussed. Theharm caused by antibiotics is not restricted to humans; it should be clear thatthey are equally harmful for animals.The real causes of human diseases include environmental pollutants, many ofwhich are discussed in chapter six; it should be clear however, that theseenvironmental pollutants will also have a serious and detrimental impact onanimal health.Nevertheless, the 2014 article about emerging diseases suggests that theemergence of new zoonoses is the result of increased contact between humans,livestock and wildlife. Expanding populations of humans and livestock havecertainly resulted in substantial changes to land use; these changes include thedevelopment of huge monoculture farms, whether for rearing livestock or forgrowing crops. This expansion of agriculture has had an impact of varyingseverity on wildlife populations and brought many wild animals into closecontact with farmers and their livestock. The result of this closer contact isthat wild animals have been increasingly exposed to the many chemical compoundsused in most agricultural practices; but these chemicals are ignored in theoriesabout animal diseases, including those claimed to affect wild animals.Instead, it is claimed in the article that ‘new zoonoses’ have emerged becauseincreasingly close contact between humans, livestock and wildlife has permittedthe spread of ‘pathogens’ that seek new hosts to ‘infect’, and facilitated theirtransmission between animal and human ‘hosts’. This claim is unfounded; as theprevious discussions have demonstrated, there is no evidence to support theassumption that so-called ‘pathogens’ cause disease, transmit infection or eventravel between ‘hosts’.The importance of exposing the fallacy of the ‘germ theory’ cannot beover-stated. The continuing belief in this fatally flawed theory continues topose increasingly serious hazards to the health of all people and all animals.The potential for a substantially heightened danger for wild animals inparticular is indicated by a very worrying prediction in the article thatstates,> “The WHO and most infectious disease experts agree that the source of the next> human pandemic is likely to be zoonotic and wildlife is emerging as the> primary source.”Chapter three demonstrated that the dire predictions about HIV/AIDS failed tomaterialise; that the 1918 Flu was not caused by a bacterium or a virus; andthat rats and their fleas have been exonerated as the causes of the Black Death.Although some reports claim that ‘HIV’ evolved from a monkey virus that‘escaped’ from Africa, this is an erroneous claim, as demonstrated by thediscussion in the previous chapter.The failure of the medical establishment to acknowledge the fallacy of the ‘germtheory’ raises serious questions about the prediction of a new pandemic, theconsequences of which have the potential to be disastrous, not only for the wildanimals deemed to be the ‘source’, but for all animals, including humans. Theseconsequences will not be due to any ‘pathogen’, but to the measures that arelikely to be introduced to address or even prevent the predicted ‘problem’.These measures will almost inevitably involve the introduction of toxicchemicals intended to kill the ‘germs’ alleged to cause the ‘disease’. It ispossible that the solutions may even involve the deliberate destruction of wildanimals; a practice that has been implemented in certain situations.The first step in any genuine effort to ‘eradicate disease’ must be theeradication of the belief in the ‘germ theory’; until this is accomplished, allanimals, and humans, will continue to face real threats to health from theinappropriate and dangerous measures introduced by the medical establishment andthe animal health community to address so-called ‘infectious diseases’.The following sections discuss a few animal diseases to demonstrate the seriousconsequences of the erroneous assumptions about their causation, and of theinappropriate measures used to control them. The final section discussesvivisection to demonstrate the reason that animal experiments should cease.As the discussions refer to animal diseases, the definitions used in thischapter are those provided on the OIE website.RabiesThe OIE definition of rabies refers to,> “…a viral disease that affects the central nervous system of warm-blooded> animals, including humans.”Rabies is classified as a zoonotic disease; as the definition explains,> “Rabies is one of the most deadly zoonoses. Each year, it kills nearly 60,000> people worldwide, mostly children in developing countries.”It is claimed that rabies is present throughout all continents of the world,with the sole exception of Antarctica; however, the May 2019 WHO fact sheetentitled Rabies states that,> “Rabies is one of the neglected tropical diseases that predominantly affects> poor and vulnerable populations who live in remote rural locations.”It is claimed that rabies is transmitted via an animal bite and that theoverwhelming majority of cases occur due to a dog bite, which exposes a personto ‘infected’ saliva. But this explanation does not seem to be consistent withthe above statements that rabies mainly affects ‘poor and vulnerable’ childrenin ‘developing’ countries.The OIE information sheet makes the interesting comment that the rabies virus isnot immediately active after the bite but instead,> “…will generally remain at the entry site for a period of time before> travelling along the nerves to the brain.”The WHO fact sheet refers to some of the symptoms associated with the disease.Although the initial symptoms are mild and include pain at the wound site and afever, far more serious symptoms are said to develop later; the fact sheetexplains,> “As the virus spreads to the central nervous system, progressive and fatal> inflammation of the brain and spinal cord develops.”The discussion in chapter three demonstrated that the particles called ‘viruses’are inert outside of a host cell; which means they cannot ‘travel’ around thebody.According to the fact sheet there are two forms of the disease, one of which iscalled ‘furious’ rabies because it is said to produce ‘hyperactive behaviour’.This behaviour may include hydrophobia, which is an alternative term for ‘fearof water’ and also the original name for rabies. The other form of the diseaseis called paralytic rabies, because it is claimed that the virus can induceparalysis.The bite from an ‘infected’ animal is said to require prompt ‘treatment’, whichrather unusually involves the administration of the rabies vaccine. The vastmajority of vaccines are administered prior to ‘exposure’ as a preventivemeasure; but the rabies vaccine can be administered both before and after‘exposure’. However, this vaccine is not routinely administeredprophylactically, except for people who are considered to be ‘at risk’ fromrabies; which mainly refers to people who work with animals, vets and animalresearchers, for example.The rabies vaccine is used for both animals and people, although the firstrabies vaccine was produced only for human use. Its development is credited tothe French chemist, Louis Pasteur, and it is considered to be another of his‘achievements’. As discussed in chapter three, Dr Geison’s research revealedthat the ‘science’ of Louis Pasteur was not as meticulous as it is believed tohave been; his formulation of the rabies vaccine was equally flawed.Prior to Louis Pasteur’s study of rabies, the ‘treatments’ used for patientsdiagnosed with this disease were of a most bizarre nature; they owed theirexistence more to superstition than to ‘science’. In her book The PoisonedNeedle, Eleanor McBean presents an extract from an essay entitled RabiesPast/Present in Scientific Review, written by physician and surgeon Dr MillicentMorden MD. The essay includes reference to examples of the pre-Pasteur treatmentof rabies,> “In 1806 a Mr. Kraus was awarded $1000, by the then rulers of New York temtory> for his scientific discovery which had kept rabies out of New York for over> twenty years. His formula is a matter of record and consisted of the groundup> jaw bone of an ass or dog, a piece of colt’s tongue and the green rust off a> penny of George the First reign.”These treatments would be more appropriately described using the previouslycited words of William White that refer to ‘a combination of absurdity withnastiness’. In view of the absurdity of these treatments, it is not surprisingthat the medical establishment regards it as ‘fortunate’ that Louis Pasteurdecided to turn his attention to a study of rabies. But it has not beenfortunate; the experiments he conducted were similar to the previously describedgruesome monkey experiments, which were claimed to demonstrate the transmissionof polio. In his book entitled The Blood Poisoners, Lionel Dole describes thenature of Louis Pasteur’s experiments,> “The manner in which Pasteur made rabbits \"rabid\" by boring holes in their> skulls and inserting filth into their brains was not science but simply brutal> quackery.”Nevertheless, it was on the basis of this brutal quackery that Louis Pasteurdeveloped his rabies vaccine. The medical establishment references to thisvaccine indicate that it was a resounding success; contemporary reports however,tell a very different story and one that again speaks of Louis Pasteur’sfundamental errors and even of fraud.In her essay, Dr Morden refers to two medical practitioners who werecontemporaries of Louis Pasteur but outspoken in their criticism of his work; asthe following extracts demonstrate. The first extract refers to Dr Bruette’sexposure of the fraud of the rabies vaccine,> “Dr William A. Bruette, former assistant chief of the Bureau of Animal> Industry in Washington, was also a contemporary of Pasteur and gave many> proofs of Pasteur’s incorrect findings. Dr Bruette has proved, as a matter of> fact, that rabies vaccine is not only a fraud, but harmful. He scorns the use> of rabies vaccine and states that ‘inoculation spreads disease.’ He goes as> far as to call the sale of rabies vaccine an out and out racket.”Although 21st century vaccines are different from those used in the 19thcentury, they are all based on the same flawed theory. The second extract refersto Dr Woods’ exposure of a major flaw in the theory about the alleged cause ofrabies,> “Dr Matthew Woods, another contemporary of Pasteur, then a leading member of> the Philadelphia Medical Society, wrote much on the subject of rabies. He> stated, ‘...at the Philadelphia dog pound, where on an average more than 6,000> vagrant dogs are taken annually, and where the catchers and keepers are> frequently bitten while handling them, not one case of hydrophobia has> occurred during its entire history of twenty-five years, in which time 150,000> dogs have been handled’.”Dr Morden cites a further quote from Dr Woods, in which he suggests alternativecauses for the symptoms that are often labelled as ‘rabies’,> “In animals, so-called rabies is fundamentally due to maltreatment or> malnutrition or both.”Dr Bruette and Dr Woods were by no means the only medical practitioners todisparage Louis Pasteur’s rabies vaccine; a critical view was also held by DrGeorge Wilson MD, President of the British Medical Society, who, at theSociety’s AGM in 1899, made the following statement that was published in theBritish Medical Journal,> “I accuse my profession of misleading the public. Pasteur's anti-rabies> vaccination is - I believe, and others with me - a piece of deception.”Unfortunately, the rabies vaccine is far more than a piece of deception; it was,and still is a serious public health problem that poses severe health hazardsfor both humans and animals. It should be clear that maltreatment andmalnutrition, the alternative causes suggested by Dr Woods, can be neitherprevented nor treated by vaccination. The health of a person or an animal cancertainly be adversely affected by vaccines. In his book, Lionel Dole expands onthe many problems associated with the use of the rabies vaccine,> “Pasteur cannot be proved to have saved a single life with his vaccines, but> it is quite certain that many people died from his treatment of them, even> when the dogs that had bitten them remained perfectly well....”Any dogs that remained ‘perfectly well’ could not have been ‘rabid’;nevertheless, many dogs were destroyed on the basis that they had a disease thatthey could transmit to people, if bitten.Although it is claimed that rabies is caused by a virus, the refutation of the‘germ theory’ in chapter three demonstrates this to be an unfounded claim. Thereis, however, other evidence that also denies the viral cause of rabies, asexplained by Hans Ruesch, a Swiss medical historian, who states, in his bookentitled 1000 Doctors (and many more) Against Vivisection, that,> “Medical students are taught that Pasteur solved the ‘problem’ of rabies in> the last century – thanks to experiments on dogs. They – and the public – are> not told that neither he nor his successors have ever been able to identify> the virus which is supposed to cause rabies....”Hans Ruesch’s book was first published in 1978; in other words, more than fourdecades after the invention of the electron microscope; this, in turn, meansthat there had been more than ample time for scientists to have identified thevirus alleged to cause rabies. The fact that it had remained unidentified in thelate 1970s demonstrates that there can be no original ‘proof’ that rabies iscaused by a ‘virus’; the idea that it can be transmitted to humans through thebite of an allegedly ‘infected’ dog is similarly unproven.In the conclusion to her essay, Dr Morden provides a summary of the mistakenideas about the existence of an ‘infectious disease’ called rabies,> “Is rabies then a disease? Have we isolated a virus or germ? Is the> Pasteur-treatment specific? Is rabies, in short, fact or fancy? I believe it> is fancy, for I have handled so-called rabid animals and humans without> benefit of Pasteur treatment and in no case has there been a death or any> other symptoms of rabies. I submit that rabies is non-existent and that the> Pasteur treatment for rabies is worse than the disease, if it were a disease,> which it is not.”The claim that human rabies is a disease of the central nervous system andinvolves inflammation of the brain, otherwise known as encephalitis, provides anindication of some of the possible causal agents for these symptoms; forexample, the discussion about the 1918 Flu referred to cases of ‘post-vaccinalencephalitis’. Some of the possible ‘side effects’ of the rabies vaccine includepain, dizziness and nausea; more serious effects include breathing difficultiesand swelling of the throat, both of which are regarded as medical emergenciesand demonstrate the dangers of the vaccine.Although contributory factors, vaccines are not the only sources of neurotoxinsto which people and animals can be exposed. However, the control of rabies issaid to require animal vaccinations, mainly for dogs; in many countries thesevaccines are mandatory.Despite the belief that they are ‘lower beings’ than humans, animals alsoexperience vaccine ‘side effects’; they can suffer stress, pain and discomfortfrom the vaccination process, as well as the more serious effects from theirtoxic ingredients. The acknowledged ‘side effects’ include vomiting and fever,both of which are obvious signs of poisoning. The American Veterinary MedicalAssociation (AVMA) provides information on the web page entitled Vaccination FAQabout the possible, common ‘side effects’ that can occur and states that some ofthe more serious reactions,> “…can be life-threatening and are medical emergencies.”The seriousness of these effects demonstrates the extent to which animals are atrisk from the effects of vaccines, including the rabies vaccine.Unfortunately, the OIE claims that the appropriate measure required to eradicaterabies is to,> “Vaccinate at least 70% of dogs.”Although rabies is mainly claimed to be transmitted via a dog bite, otheranimals are also implicated as vectors that are able to transmit the ‘virus’alleged to cause rabies; these animals include bats, raccoons and cats. The ideathat rabies can be eradicated by only vaccinating dogs is, therefore, yetanother anomaly that remains unexplained.Despite the complete lack of evidence that it is a genuine disease, rabiescontinues to be considered as an important zoonosis that requires many animals,especially pets, to be subjected to vaccines; this is highly lucrative for thepharmaceutical industry but extremely detrimental to the health of both humansand animals.Bovine TBThe OIE definition of bovine TB refers to,> “…a chronic disease of animals…”It is claimed that bovine TB is caused by Mycobacterium bovis, which suggests itis a disease that is exclusive to cattle, but the OIE definition indicatesotherwise,> “This disease can affect practically all mammals, causing a general state of> illness, coughing and eventual death.”Although human TB is said to be caused by a different bacterium, M.tuberculosis, it is nevertheless claimed that bovine TB is zoonotic, whichindicates that humans are also able to contract this disease. One of the mainroutes by which transmission to humans is said to occur is through drinking rawmilk from allegedly ‘infected’ cows; a situation that is claimed to occur morefrequently in ‘developing’ countries, in which the pasteurisation of milk is nota common practice. It is claimed that the pasteurisation process makes milk‘safe’ because it kills bacteria; but this is yet another disastrous legacy ofthe ‘germ theory’ and the flawed science of Louis Pasteur.Cattle are a major source of food for people throughout most parts of the world;a serious and potentially fatal cattle disease is, therefore, understandably amatter of grave concern for cattle farmers; but they are misled about the realcauses of animal diseases, including bovine TB.One of the major concerns of the medical establishment is the lack of success inthe attempts to control and eradicate this disease; this concern is expressed bya 2007 article entitled Tuberculosis: a reemerging disease at the interface ofdomestic animals and wildlife, which states that,> “As many countries attempt to eradicate M. bovis from domestic livestock,> efforts are impeded by spill back from wildlife reservoirs.”The term ‘reservoir host’ was briefly discussed in the opening section of thischapter, in which it was explained that it is used to refer to animals thatnaturally ‘harbour’ a pathogen. Although the discussion in chapter threereferred to bacteria as part of the human microbiota, it should be obvious thatthe human body is not their only natural habitat; bacteria are acknowledged toinhabit the bodies of most, if not all animals, and certainly all mammals. It istherefore unsurprising that M. bovis should have been ‘found’ in the bodies of anumber of different mammals.The OIE information sheet about bovine TB claims that M. bovis has been‘isolated’ from a very wide range of animals, including, but not limited to:sheep, goats, equines, buffaloes, bison, camels, pigs, deer, antelopes, dogs,cats, foxes, mink, badgers, ferrets, rats, primates, elephants, otters, hares,moles, raccoons, lions, tigers, leopards and lynx. The ‘isolation’ of abacterium from any of these animals does not prove they are ‘reservoir hosts’ orthat they can facilitate the transmission of infective agents. Significantly,however, it is not claimed that these animals are necessarily ‘diseased’.Nevertheless, the 2007 article claims that,> “It will not be possible to eradicate M. bovis from livestock until> transmission between wildlife and domestic animals is halted.”The priority given to livestock can have disastrous consequences for wild animalspecies claimed to be ‘reservoirs’ of allegedly ‘pathogenic’ bacteria. This is asituation that has arisen in the UK, where the badger is claimed to be the main‘reservoir’ of M. bovis and held responsible for the existence of TB in cattleherds; but this claim is unproven, as the article acknowledges,> “…although most of the evidence is indirect, it is hypothesized that badgers> are a source of infection for cattle and responsible for the increase in> tuberculosis among domestic cattle herds.”The basis for this ‘hypothesis’ is that M. bovis has been ‘isolated’ frombadgers; a correlation that has been assumed to mean causation; but this is amistaken assumption. Furthermore, it should be obvious that, even if bacteriawere transmitted between animals, they could just as easily be transmitted inthe opposite direction; in other words, from cattle to badgers. The main problemis the erroneous belief that bacteria are pathogens that can transmit diseasebetween animals.There are claimed to be two possible solutions to the bovine TB problem in theUK; badgers should be either vaccinated or culled, even though neither of thesemeasures would be able to genuinely reduce the incidence of TB in cattle.Nevertheless, a badger vaccination programme was implemented, but halted in 2015due to a shortage of the BCG vaccine. However, the result of this programme wasdescribed in a December 2015 article entitled UK Badger vaccination projectsthreatened by global BCG shortage on the website of the Farmers Guardian thatstates,> “The latest report from the vaccination area concludes there has been no> meaningful change in TB levels.”The shortage of the BCG vaccine inevitably resulted in the implementation ofbadger culling programmes, as indicated by a December 2015 article entitledBadger cull kills more than 10,000 animals in three months; the title isself-explanatory.In April 2018, the UK Government remained committed to the eradication of bovineTB and, according to their website,> “The Government is committed to eradicating bovine TB and sees badger culling> as central to this.”The Wildlife Trusts disagrees with this view and instead claims that badgershave been made the scapegoats for bovine TB; on their web page entitled BovineTuberculosis (bTB), is the statement that,> “The scientific evidence demonstrates that culling is likely to be ineffective> in fighting the disease…”Unfortunately, they recommend that cattle should receive the TB vaccine,together with all of the other vaccines administered to them.However, as demonstrated by the discussions in chapter two, no vaccine iseffective; this inevitably applies to animal vaccines as well as those used forhumans. The OIE acknowledges that animal vaccines are of questionable efficacyand states that the animal TB vaccine,> “…is not widely used as a preventive measure in animals: the efficacy of> existing vaccines is variable and it interferes with testing to eliminate the> disease.”The comment that the vaccine ‘interferes with testing’ is significant becauseboth the test and the vaccines are made using bacterial antigenic material.Nevertheless, a reaction to a vaccine is claimed to indicate ‘immunity’, whereasa reaction to the test is claimed to indicate ‘infection’. This is aninconsistency that is entirely inexplicable within the context of the ‘germtheory’, and raises serious questions about the ‘science’ used to determine thehealth, or otherwise, of animals reared for human consumption.Advice about TB testing for cattle farmers in the UK is provided by TB Hub,which is described as a joint industry initiative and is supported by DEFRA(Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs), a UK Governmentdepartment. Under the heading How does it work? on the page entitled Tuberculinskin testing, is the statement that,> “…the skin test in cattle relies on measuring the immune response of the> animal to injections of tuberculin. Tuberculin is a complex mix of proteins> extracted from cultures of M. bovis grown in the laboratory and killed by> heat.”The page provides further details about the testing procedure and how theresults are interpreted to determine which cattle have been ‘infected’ withbovine TB,> “The skin test is comparative as the animal’s immune response to injections of> both bovine and avian (bird) tuberculin is measured and compared. By> simultaneously injecting two types of tuberculin into the deep layers of the> skin of the neck, the test can better distinguish between animals infected> with M. bovis and animals previously exposed to or infected with other types> of mycobacteria found in the environment which do not cause bovine TB.”It is claimed that an animal 'infected' with the TB bacterium will produce areaction at the site of the bovine tuberculin injection, as indicated by thestatement that,> “Cattle that are infected with M. bovis tend to show a greater reaction to> bovine tuberculin than avian tuberculin.”The animals deemed to be infected undergo further procedures to confirm theextent of their reaction; however, the general process is described succinctlyby the OIE that states,> “The standard control measure applied to TB is test and slaughter.”Fortunately, this measure is not applied to humans who test positive on a TBskin test.The slaughter of animals regarded as ‘infected’ due to a significant reaction tothe test is a relatively new phenomenon. In her book Animal Research TakesLives, Bette Overell cites an article entitled Animal health without vaccineswritten by F Newman Turner, editor of the magazine The Farmer. An extract fromthe article states,> “Tuberculosis has also been treated effectively, and animals rejected by the> Ministry of Agriculture as tubercular have, after natural treatment,> subsequently been readmitted to the herd by the same Ministry, as sound, and> have continued to pass the tuberculin test regularly. I have even taken the> discharges of cows badly suffering from mastitis and applied the virulent> bacteria to the udders of healthy cows, with no ill-effect whatever to the> healthy cow.”It is clear therefore, that a reaction to the test is not indicative of‘infection’ with a ‘dangerous’ disease that is always fatal.The establishment obsession with the idea that microorganisms are the majorcauses of disease, has effectively denied attention to any other theories aboutthe causes of health problems in cattle, or to alternative treatments that arenot based on pharmaceutical products.One of the factors rarely considered as relevant to animal TB is the effect ofthe huge quantities of drugs and chemicals that are used in modern day farmingpractices and agriculture generally; antibiotics in particular, are used inimmense quantities, as discussed in the opening section of this chapter.Furthermore, if the ‘germ theory’ were correct, the routine use of antibioticsin cattle farming would ensure that all animals were continually protected andnone of them would succumb to any ‘bacterial infection’. However, far from beingprotective of their health, antibiotics are harmful to animals as well ashumans; this is discussed by Heinrich Kremer in his book entitled The SilentRevolution in Cancer and AIDS Medicine,> “The treatment of animals or man with antibacterial drugs can have harmful> effects on mitochondrial function, especially in tissues that have a high> proliferation rate.”Antibiotic drugs are harmful for animals; but they are not the only toxicsubstances to which livestock can be exposed. Although many environmentalpollutants and contaminants can adversely affect the health of animals, certainfarming practices are contributory factors to animal illness, even though theyare implemented in the name of animal welfare, as the next discussion willdemonstrate.BSE (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy)The OIE definition states that,> “BSE is a progressive, fatal disease of the nervous system of cattle.”Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy is usually referred to by the abbreviation BSE,but it is also known as ‘mad cow disease’, which is said to be an aptdescription of an animal with this condition.BSE is not the only form of Spongiform Encephalopathy; there are other typesthat affect other animals, and these are referred to under the general headingof Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy, or TSE, the causes of which areexplained by the OIE information sheet about BSE that states,> “BSE, like other TSEs, is characterized by the presence of an abnormal> infectious protein called a prion in nervous tissue.”The information sheet also states that,> “The subsequent spongy degeneration of the brain results in severe and fatal> neurological signs and symptoms.”Although referred to as ‘transmissible’, one form of TSE only affects sheep andgoats; this disease is more commonly known as ‘scrapie’, which is also an aptdescription of the behaviour of animals with this condition, as they oftenscrape their fleeces against stationary objects. However, scrapie is alsodescribed as a fatal degenerative disease that involves more than fleecescraping.The characteristic of the ‘infectious protein’ that is claimed by the OIE to be‘abnormal’ and the cause of TSEs is that it is ‘misfolded’. It is also claimedthat the misfolding of a protein induces other proteins to become ‘misfolded’and it is this process that is claimed to activate the ‘disease’. However,despite these claims, the establishment information about TSEs shows that theactual mechanism of action, by which the proteins become misfolded and producedisease, is poorly understood.It is not only animals that are claimed to be affected by diseases claimed to becaused by misfolded proteins known as prions. A well-known example is CJD(Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease), which is claimed to be the human version of BSE andis described as an incurable fatal neurodegenerative condition. One form of CJD,referred to as vCJD (variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease), is claimed to beacquired from animals, which has led to the classification of BSE as a zoonoticdisease.Interestingly there are a number of human neurodegenerative diseases that arealso claimed to be associated with misfolded proteins; these diseases includeAlzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and ALS (Amyotrophic LateralSclerosis).Although BSE is claimed to be caused by an ‘infectious agent’, the source ofthis ‘pathogen’ is unknown; as the OIE information sheet indicates,> “Scientists believe that the spread of this disease in cattle is caused by> feeding rendered material from infected cattle or sheep back to other cattle.”The statement that ‘scientists believe’ demonstrates that this idea has not beenconclusively proven; although the OIE claims that,> “…dairy herds are fed concentrate rations that contain meat-and-bone meal…”The idea that a feed product containing ‘meat and bone meal’ is the cause of BSEwas refuted by Mark Purdey, who, in his book entitled Animal Pharm, relates hisresearch and experiences as a farmer during the first BSE outbreak in the 1980sin England,> “As a working livestock farmer and TSE researcher with firsthand experience of> BSE erupting in cattle that had been purchased into my organic farm, I was> struck by the fact that no cases of BSE had ever emerged in cows that had been> born and raised on fully converted organic farms, despite those cattle having> been permitted access to the feed that contained the incriminated meat and> bone meal (MBM) ingredient - as part of their 20% conventional feeding stuff> allowance decreed in the organic standards at that time.”Although Mark Purdey demonstrated that MBM was not the cause of BSE, it shouldbe noted that cattle are herbivores, not omnivores. The natural diet of cattleis grass, which is rich in cellulose; the digestive systems of cattle consist offour stomach compartments that are able to process grass and obtain the requirednutrients from it. The use of meat and bone meal as a ‘feed’ for cattle wasclearly inappropriate.The types of MBM alleged to have been the cause of BSE have since been banned,but cases of BSE continue to be reported, which demonstrates that MBM could nothave been the sole or even the main cause of this disease.Through his research, Mark Purdey discovered that a much more likely cause ofBSE was phosmet, a chemical insecticide used as a cattle ‘wash’ in the controlof warble fly, an insect pest common to cattle. This insecticide, which containsa chemical compound made from phosphorus, is applied directly onto the animals,usually over their necks; the neurotoxic properties of phosphorus-basedchemicals is discussed in chapter six.However, cattle in the UK suffered a significantly greater degree ofneurological effects than cattle in the many other countries that also used thisinsecticide; the reason for this is explained by Mark Purdey, who states that,> “In 1982 measures were passed that enforced twice annual application of a> uniquely concentrated dose (20 mg/kg bodyweight) of a systemic acting> organo-dithio-phosphate insecticide for the control of warbles on UK cattle.> Amongst a myriad of toxicological effects, the systemic types of> dithio-phosphate can chelate copper and open up the blood brain barrier;> thereby disturbing the overall crucial balance of metals in the brain.”The application of the insecticide ‘wash’ onto the necks of cattle enabled thetoxic chemicals to penetrate into their heads and seep into their brains. Theeffects were clearly extremely unpleasant for the cattle, as demonstrated by thebehaviour that earned the label ‘mad cow disease’. The subsequent ‘outbreak’ ofBSE in the UK due to the high concentration of phosmet, resulted in theslaughter of millions of cattle. The incidence of BSE in countries that did notuse such a high concentration of phosmet was lower than in the UK, as MarkPurdey explains,> “The few other European countries who instigated warble fly campaigns (e.g.;> France, Switzerland, Ireland, etc) used lower doses of insecticide, and, not> surprisingly, developed proportionately fewer cases of BSE as a result.”Unsurprisingly, Mark Purdey’s research was not widely publicised, but of greaterconcern are the actions taken by the authorities to discredit his research work;as he also explains in his book,> “Despite publication in a variety of scientific journals, the authorities and> their key advisors are ignoring these findings and are doing their utmost to> marginalise those of us who are trying to pursue this line of research.”Unfortunately, the medical establishment invariably fails to associate toxicchemicals with the outbreak of any ‘disease’, except in rare circumstances, inwhich the link is too obvious to be ignored.One of the likely reasons for the failure of the UK establishment to associatetoxic insecticides with BSE is because of the potential consequences. Therevelation that it was the high concentration of a recommended toxic insecticidewash that had caused the problem and resulted in the unnecessary slaughter ofmillions of cattle, would have had serious ramifications, as Mark Purdeyexplains,> “If, however, it was officially verified that phosmet was a cause of BSE,> compensation claims worth billions would be filed, not only against the> British government but also the insecticide manufacturers.”The connection between BSE, a disease of the nervous system, and neurotoxicchemicals offers a far more compelling explanation than that of an allegedlyinfectious ‘misfolded’ protein. Although misfolded proteins have been found inconnection with neurodegenerative diseases, this fact does not ‘prove’ that theyare the cause. It is far more likely that proteins become misfolded as theresult of exposures to toxins, especially neurotoxins.Unfortunately, whilst the ‘germ theory’ remains firmly embedded within themedical establishment doctrines about disease, the real role of proteins withinthe body will not be properly studied and will remain poorly understood.Another cattle disease that is similar to both bovine TB and BSE and also basedon the ‘germ theory’ dogma, is foot and mouth disease (FMD), which is regardedas viral, highly infectious and sometimes fatal. The previously cited articleabout reservoirs of infection states that,> “…Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is maintained in unvaccinated cattle> populations…”However, in his book entitled Universal Immunization, Medical Miracle orMasterful Mirage, Dr Raymond Obomsawin PhD recounts details from his interviewwith Dr Archie Kalokerinos MD, who, at the time, was Chief Medical Officer atthe Aboriginal Health Clinic in Australia,> “He related an experience wherein cattle feeding on grass grown on> re-mineralized soil, were grazing literally nose to nose--at the fence> line--with another herd infected with hoof and mouth disease. Without the> benefit of any specific protective measures including vaccines, the uninfected> herd manifested total immunity.”Although not a ‘laboratory experiment’, this observation from the real worldprovides empirical evidence that FMD cannot be infectious. Furthermore, the factthat the uninfected herd were also unvaccinated supports the assertion thatvaccination does not confer immunity to disease; it can, and clearly does,confer ill-health.MyxomatosisThe OIE definition of myxomatosis refers to,> “…an important disease of rabbits caused by a poxvirus called the Myxoma virus> (MV).”Myxomatosis is not classified as zoonotic; which means that it is not a diseaseof concern for human health. It is, however, an extremely unusual animal diseasefor two reasons, the first of which is that it is claimed to only affect rabbitsand hares. The second reason is that its degree of virulence is claimed to bedependent upon the species of rabbit ‘infected’ by the virus; as the OIE states,> “MV causes a very mild disease in its original host native to South America,> but in some species of rabbits and hares, especially the European rabbits it> causes a severe disease with high mortality.”It would seem that the Myxoma virus is highly specialised; yet, inexplicably, itis claimed that MV has a completely ‘normal’ mode of transmission. According tothe OIE,> “Spread mainly occurs through fleas and mosquitoes which ingest the virus> while biting infected animals and then transmit the disease to other> susceptible animals.”This statement suggests that transmission of the ‘virus’ is synonymous withtransmission of ‘disease’, but this cannot be the case if animals must be‘susceptible’ before succumbing to the disease. Unfortunately, the OIE does notexplain what constitutes ‘susceptibility’; but their statement indicates thatthe onset of disease requires other factors in addition to an alleged‘infection’ with a virus.It is claimed that a number of biting insects are carriers of the Myxoma virus,but that mosquitoes are the principal vectors. The two species of mosquitoassociated with the transmission of myxomatosis are Aedes and Anopheles, both ofwhich are also associated with the transmission of many human diseases. Aedes issaid to transmit diseases such as yellow fever; Anopheles is said to be the mainvector of malaria. Yet these mosquitoes are claimed to only transmit the Myxomavirus to rabbits, despite the fact that they bite humans and a variety ofanimals.It is reported that the Myxoma virus was introduced into the rabbit populationof Australia in the mid-20th century as a method of ‘biological control’.However, the refutation of the ‘germ theory’ means that myxomatosis cannot becaused by a virus; which raises questions about the Australian experience andabout the real causes of this disease. These questions prompted the authors ofthis book to conduct a more in-depth investigation of the subject, the resultsof which are revealed in this discussion.The establishment reports state that myxomatosis was first recognised in 1896 asthe result of the work of Giuseppe Sanarelli, an Italian microbiologist, who issaid to have imported a colony of domestic European rabbits from Brazil toUruguay for research purposes; but all the rabbits died suddenly from a virulent‘infectious disease’ that acquired the label ‘myxomatosis’. Although claimed tobe a viral disease, the actual ‘virus’ could not have been observed prior to theinvention of the electron microscope in the 1930s.The rabbit problem in Australia is reported to have begun after the inadvertentrelease of some European rabbits in 1859. The result of this incident was thatrabbit numbers rapidly increased to such an unprecedented level that they veryquickly became a significant pest, especially for Australian farmers andlandowners. The prior ‘discovery’ that myxomatosis was a fatal disease ofEuropean rabbits led to the notion that the introduction of the ‘disease’ intothe rabbit population might be an effective method of reducing their numbers.The first attempt to introduce myxomatosis was conducted in 1926; it is reportedto have been unsuccessful. Further attempts were made during the 1930s, but,although curtailed by the advent of WWII, they are also reported to have beenunsuccessful. However, efforts to reduce the rabbit population by infecting themwith myxomatosis were resumed in 1949 under a research programme headed by theAustralian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).Professor Frank Fenner, an Australian virologist, is regarded as the keyscientist in myxomatosis research. He joined the CSIRO team in early 1951 afterthe first ‘outbreak’ of the disease; as he recounts in his book entitled Nature,Nurture and Chance,> “Several field trials failed, but in the Christmas-New Year period of 1950-51> the disease escaped from one of the four trial sites in the Murray valley and> spread all over the Murray-Darling basin, killing millions of rabbits.”This episode is claimed to have virtually eradicated the rabbit population andis regarded as the first ‘successful’ introduction of myxomatosis; ProfessorFenner states that it was this ‘outbreak’ that inspired him to study thevirology of the disease. He adds an extremely interesting comment that,> “The climatic conditions at the time of the outbreak of myxomatosis in the> Murray-Darling Basin had been such that there was also an outbreak of> encephalitis in that region…”The simultaneous outbreak of human encephalitis and myxomatosis generated anunderstandable level of concern that these diseases were somehow related; it waseven suggested that the Myxoma virus may have been responsible for the cases ofencephalitis. These fears were alleviated after it had been reported thatProfessor Fenner and two of his colleagues had remained unaffected after beinginoculated with the virus. Although neither disease is caused by a virus, theirconcurrence is nevertheless significant; it will be shown that they have causesin common.The CSIRO myxomatosis programme involved a number of field studies conducted byProfessor Fenner and his team of researchers over the course of a number ofyears. This research is documented in a series of seven papers entitled Studiesin the Epidemiology of Infectious Myxomatosis of Rabbits. The second paper ofthis series refers to the CSIRO experiments conducted during 1950, and containssome interesting information about the procedures used to ‘infect’ the rabbitswith the ‘virus’; the paper states,> “All rabbits caught were inoculated subcutaneously with 1.0ml of a> glycerolated liver-lung extract from a diseased rabbit…”This means therefore, that rabbits were inoculated with ‘extract of diseasedrabbit’.This second paper also refers to the role of mosquitoes in the spread of‘infection’, and states that the relevant species are Anopheles and Culex, butnot Aedes. On the basis of the idea that they are the vectors of MV, theresearchers collected mosquitoes in order to extract the ‘virus’. The process ofobtaining ‘virus’ from mosquitoes is quite revealing; it is described in thepaper under the sub-heading Recovery of virus from mosquitoes, which states thatthe researchers caught 168 female Culex mosquitoes that were,> “…ground up in a mortar and pestle and taken up in 5ml normal saline. Of this> suspension 0.5ml was inoculated subcutaneously into the right flank of a> laboratory rabbit.”In other words, in these experiments, rabbits were inoculated with ‘extract ofground mosquito’, rather than ‘extract of diseased rabbit’.The third paper in the series documents another process of obtaining ‘virus’from mosquitoes; the process is described in this paper under the sub-headingRecovery of virus from mosquitoes which states that the mosquitoes were,> “…quickly cooled and then ground with alundum in a cold mortar and pestle in> batches of about fifty insects, taken up in 2ml of saline containing 10% horse> serum, 2,000 units of penicillin per ml and 20,000 units of streptomycin per> ml. After centrifugation a proportion of the supernatant material was ampouled> and stored in a dry ice cabinet. The rest was inoculated intradermally in the> rabbit…”The results of the entire series of field studies display a varying degree of‘virulence’ of the disease introduced into the rabbit population. Theresearchers also report that they had observed many rabbits with scar tissue,which they interpreted to indicate that some rabbits had been able to recoverfrom the disease; this means that the disease cannot be inherently fatal.The most significant aspect of these field study experiments is that ‘outbreaks’of the disease, other than the one that occurred in 1950/51, were all reportedto have been at a greatly reduced ‘virulence’; none of them had the samedevastating effect on rabbits. The researchers claim that the reason for thereduced mortality was that the rabbits had developed ‘resistance’ and had become‘immune’ to the disease. But this claim is unfounded, because myxomatosis‘outbreaks’ continue to occur in Australia.The Australian field studies were not the only efforts to introduce myxomatosisto control rabbits. An article entitled Failure of Myxomatosis on SkokholmIsland, published in 1955 in the journal Nature, details three separate attemptsto introduce myxomatosis and states,> “In each attempt the marked rabbits (inoculated with the virus) appeared to> have died within the usual period of less than fourteen days; but there was> little or no spread to uninoculated rabbits.”The failure of any spread of disease on these occasions is claimed to be becausethe virus can only ‘infect’ a healthy animal through a scratch, cut or insectbite. However, this raises a fundamental question about the allegedly successfulspread of the disease in 1950/51 that is claimed to have killed millions ofrabbits.It is clear that the many efforts to introduce an ‘infectious disease’ ofrabbits produced inconsistent results that are inexplicable from the perspectiveof the ‘germ theory’. These variable results are, however, more than adequatelyexplicable from the perspective of toxic chemicals.The phenomenal surge in rabbit numbers after 1859 had encouraged Australianfarmers and landholders to utilise a variety of poisons in their attempts toexterminate the rabbit ‘pest’; they had therefore used poisons for almost acentury before the myxomatosis programme began. An article entitled The Balanceof Nature Upset in Australia on the Rewilding Australia website, refers to someof the poisons used for ‘pest control’ during the 19th century; they includestrychnine, arsenic, cyanide and phosphorous baits. Lead arsenate is alsodocumented to have been used as a pesticide, but, although not used to poisonrabbits, this highly toxic substance is a persistent environmental contaminant.The impression from most establishment reports about myxomatosis is that therabbit ‘problem’ was not successfully tackled until the field studies of the1950s. However, this would seem to be a false impression, as the Rewildingarticle cites a letter written in 1921 by an Australian who laments the loss oflarge animals that would have been natural predators of rabbits and other‘pests’. The author of the letter claims that the loss of these predators wasmainly the result of the ‘compulsory poison law’; he states,> “We also have a compulsory poison law, which compels every landowner in the> Commonwealth to continually poison his land, from year’s end to year’s end.”He also states that, as a consequence of this law, the land was,> “…always covered more or less with the carcases of poisoned rabbits…”The various poisons used during the 19th century were certainly dangerous andclearly resulted in the death of large numbers of rabbits; but they were unableto completely exterminate them. Rabbits are known to be prolific breeders, andtherefore any rabbits that survived the mass poisonings would have been able tocontribute to the recovery of their numbers.Although their use largely ceased in the early 20th century when newpetrochemical-based pesticides were introduced, many ingredients of the oldpoisons, such as arsenic, are known to be persistent; which means that theycontinued to contaminate the soil and water.Rabbits were not the only ‘pests’ to be controlled through the use of poisons;mosquitoes are also relentlessly poisoned due to the notion that they are thevectors of many deadly diseases. The obvious area in which to apply aninsecticide is the normal habitat of the insect. As mosquitoes require water forbreeding purposes, they are naturally found in their greatest numbers near tosources of fresh water such as rivers and streams. Rabbits also require water todrink; which means that they too need to live near sources of fresh water.It is therefore unsurprising that mosquitoes and rabbits are found in similarhabitats; it is interesting to note that the areas in which the myxomatosisfield studies were conducted were mainly riverside habitats, as the second ofthe field study papers states,> “A close connection was demonstrated, on the flats bordering the Murray River,> between the distribution of these insects and myxomatosis activity.”Strangely, although poisons had been used over a significant period of timeagainst both of these ‘pests’, there are no references to insecticides,pesticides or other chemicals in any of the seven papers of the field studyseries. Yet various types of pesticides had been used; as acknowledged by theAustralian Department of the Environment website which refers to theintroduction of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and states,> “Since they were first introduced into Australia in the mid 1940s, OCPs have> been used in many commercial products…”The OCPs introduced into Australia include DDT, chlordane, dieldrin andheptachlor, all of which have since been banned, either in the 1970s or 1980s,due to their extreme toxicity. The timing of the introduction of these extremelytoxic substances and the subsequent virtual extermination of the rabbitpopulation in 1950/51 cannot be dismissed as unconnected.Organophosphates (OPs) are another class of toxic chemicals used in Australia tocombat many insect ‘pests’, including mosquitoes; these chemicals act on thenervous system and have been associated with encephalitis. The simultaneous‘outbreaks’ of encephalitis and myxomatosis indicates a very strong likelihoodthat OP insecticides had been used in the area. The field studies were solelyfocused on the belief in a viral cause of myxomatosis and so they failed toinvestigate any possible toxicological aspects of the rabbit ‘disease’. Theyclearly failed to recognise the possibility that insecticides may have beencontributory factors; especially insecticides containing neurotoxins.Phosphorus compounds are different from organophosphates, although both arerecognised to be toxic. As previously discussed, phosphorus had been used asfertiliser since the late 19th century, and the work of Dr Scobey indicated theexistence of a connection between phosphorus and paralysis. Furthermore, theRewilding article refers to the use of phosphorous baits in the battle to poisonrabbits.The symptoms of phosphorus poisoning in humans include eye irritation,respiratory tract problems, eye burns and skin burns; interestingly, thesymptoms of myxomatosis are red runny eyes, high fever, swollen mucousmembranes, swollen eyes, nose, mouth and ears, plus respiratory problems. Thesesimilarities are striking and strongly indicate that, despite physiologicaldifferences between humans and rabbits, phosphorus-based chemicals should alsobe considered as likely contributory factors for the rabbit ‘disease’ that isreferred to as ‘myxomatosis’.Another highly toxic pesticide is sodium fluoroacetate, which is also known as1080. This compound is an organofluorine; its effectiveness as a rodenticide isclaimed to have been reported in the early 1940s. It is also reported to havebeen introduced into ‘rabbit control programmes’ in the early 1950s, whichindicates that it may not have contributed to the first devastating ‘outbreak’during 1950, but is likely to have contributed to some of the later ‘outbreaks’.The ‘poison laws’ that demanded the application of many poisons were implementedto address the ‘rabbit problem’; yet they clearly failed to take account of theenvironmental impact from the use of multiple toxic chemicals. It iswell-documented that many toxic chemicals act synergistically, whichsubstantially enhances their combined toxicity.It is abundantly clear that adherence to the ‘germ theory’ severely limited theinvestigations of the Australian researchers, as it narrowed their focus to theidea that myxomatosis was caused by a ‘virus’. As the field study papersindicate, the rabbits were in fact inoculated with ‘extract of diseased rabbit’and ‘extract of ground mosquitoes’. The only context in which these extracts canbe referred to as ‘virus’ is in the original meaning of the word that refers toa ‘poison’ or ‘noxious substance’, rather than an ‘infectious agent’. Thealleged ‘success’ that resulted in millions of dead rabbits prevented anyalternative research to study other possible causes of the 1950/51 ‘outbreak’ ofdisease.In the absence of any definitive documentary evidence, it may be suggested thatthe idea that ‘rabbit poisoning’ is the cause of myxomatosis is purelyspeculative. There is however, ample evidence that a variety of poisons had beenused over a significant period, some poisons were even mandated, as indicated bythe ‘poison laws’. It is therefore wholly appropriate to posit the theory thattoxic chemicals and pesticides contributed to the various ‘outbreaks’ ofmyxomatosis, but that during 1950, a pesticide, or a combination of pesticideshad been used in greater quantities or a stronger concentration than usual. Thismore potent degree of poisoning would certainly account for the high rabbitmortality that was synchronous with the cases of human encephalitis.It is, of course, highly unlikely that the unique, and far more compelling,explanation of the real cause of myxomatosis presented in this discussion willbe acknowledged by the medical or scientific communities, for the same reasonthat they refuse to acknowledge the real cause of the disease referred to asBSE.AnthraxThe OIE definition of anthrax refers to,> “…a disease caused by the spore-forming bacteria Bacillus anthracis.”Like rabies, anthrax is said to be found on all continents of the world, withthe sole exception of Antarctica; yet the OIE anthrax information sheet claimsthat only a few types of animal are likely to contract the disease,> “While most animals are susceptible, anthrax is typically a disease of> ruminants and humans.”In a 2008 document entitled Anthrax in humans and animals, the WHO reveals thelow level of medical establishment knowledge about anthrax,> “Although anthrax has been recognized for centuries, little is known about the> disease…”This is an incredible admission in view of the authoritative assertions made bythe medical establishment about this disease; however, as will be demonstrated,these assertions are full of anomalies and contradictions. One of the anomaliesis that, although it is claimed to be zoonotic and caused by a bacterium,anthrax is also claimed to be non-contagious, as the OIE states,> “Anthrax does not spread from animal to animal nor from person to person.”The reason that ruminants are thought to be more susceptible to the disease isexplained in the WHO document that states,> “It is a long-held belief that animals generally acquire anthrax by ingestion> of spores while grazing or browsing.”By contrast, people are believed to contract anthrax in a different manner,which is via contact with ‘infected’ animals and animal products; this ‘contact’includes consumption of the meat of ‘infected’ animals. Nevertheless, the WHOacknowledges that,> “…anomalies in the epizootiology of the disease often arise that are hard to> explain in terms of simple ingestion of spores.”These anomalies may be the reason behind the idea that there are three types ofanthrax; namely cutaneous, inhalational and gastrointestinal. However, even ifanthrax were caused by bacteria, which of course it cannot be, these ‘types’merely represent the different routes through which the ‘infection’ would enterthe body.The bacterium B. anthracis is referred to as ‘spore-forming’; it is however,more correct to use the term ‘endospore’ in order to differentiate bacterialspores from fungal spores. As discussed in chapter three, bacteria have theability to become dormant under certain conditions; ‘endospore’ is the term usedfor this dormant state. It is claimed that the dormant state ceases when anendospore gains entry into the body of a grazing animal, where it proceeds to‘germinate’ and become ‘pathogenic’.Although the WHO admits to knowing little about anthrax, it is neverthelessregarded as a disease of significant concern for humans; it is said to be fatalif untreated. Unfortunately, the appropriate ‘treatment’ involves the use oflarge doses of antibiotics.It is claimed that the danger from B. anthracis bacteria arises from the toxinsthey produce; according to the OIE,> “The bacteria produce extremely potent toxins which are responsible for the> ill effects, causing a high mortality rate.”The WHO anthrax document describes some of the ill-effects these toxins areclaimed to produce,> “The spectrum of disease ranges from asymptomatic to severe, terminating in> sepsis, septic shock and death.”The idea that a toxin can produce ‘asymptomatic disease’ is highly anomalous.The symptoms of sepsis and septic shock clearly demonstrate that ‘toxins’ ofsome description are major causal agents of anthrax; the refutation of the ‘germtheory’ means that these toxins do not, however, have a bacterial origin.The scientific study of anthrax began during the 18th century, but, althoughsome theories were proposed, no causal agent was found. More serious outbreaksof disease in farm animals occurred during the 19th century and these promptedfurther study of the problem. The ‘discovery’ in 1876 of the bacterium B.anthracis is attributed to Dr Robert Koch, who is also credited with providingthe ‘proof’ that this bacterium is the causal agent of anthrax. The disease offarm animals also drew the attention of the French chemist Louis Pasteur, as theOIE states,> “…effective vaccination against anthrax was first demonstrated by Louis> Pasteur in 1881.”Unfortunately, Louis Pasteur’s work with anthrax suffered from the same flawed‘science’ as all his other work. In Pasteur: Plagiarist, Imposter, R B Pearsonrelates a number of incidents that demonstrate the failure of the Pasteuranthrax vaccine to protect animals from the disease. In a particularly clearexample, he describes the use of the Pasteur vaccine in Russia, where 4,564sheep were vaccinated, after which 3,696 sheep died; a phenomenally high failurerate.The Pasteur animal anthrax vaccine was replaced in the 1930s by one developed byveterinarian Max Sterne. The CDC web page entitled Anthrax Sterne strain (34F2)of Bacillus anthracis, explains that the Sterne strain of the bacillus is,> “…currently the predominant strain used for immunization of domesticated> animals against anthrax worldwide, and has been used for this purpose for many> decades.”Although claimed to be ‘avirulent’, this vaccine nevertheless uses ‘live’anthrax spores, as indicated by a 1991 article entitled Anthrax vaccines: past,present and future, which states that,> “Most livestock vaccines in use throughout the world today for immunization> against anthrax are derivatives of the live spore vaccine formulated by Sterne> in 1937 and still use descendants of his strain 34F2.”Anthrax is also claimed to pose a serious health threat to humans, however,according to the WHO web page entitled Guidance on anthrax: frequently askedquestions,> “Anthrax responds well to antibiotic treatment.”One of the questions refers to the existence of a vaccine, to which the WHOresponse is that,> “There is a vaccine against anthrax, but it is not approved for widespread use> because it has never been comprehensively tested in human trials.”The reason for this surprising situation is because it is claimed to be‘unethical’ to expose humans to such a deadly ‘pathogen’; however, certaingroups of people deemed to be ‘at risk’ are advised to receive this vaccine to‘protect’ them. Tannery workers were included in the ‘at risk’ category andhave, in the past, been routinely vaccinated, but this requirement no longerapplies.The main group of people who continue to be regarded as ‘at risk’, and aretherefore vaccinated against anthrax, are military personnel; especially,although not exclusively, those in the US. The reason that military personnelare considered to be ‘at risk’ is because they are claimed to face a potentialthreat from the use of anthrax spores as ‘biological weapons’ during militaryconflicts.The discussions in chapter two demonstrated that no vaccine is either safe oreffective; this includes the anthrax vaccine; a fact that is acknowledged by a2002 article entitled The Anthrax Vaccine Program: An Analysis of the CDC’sRecommendations for Vaccine Use, which states that,> “The anthrax vaccine was never proved to be safe and effective.”Although never proven to be safe or effective, the anthrax vaccine has beenproven to be unsafe and to produce serious adverse health effects. The abovecited article by Dr Meryl Nass MD also makes the pertinent comment that,> “It is one cause of Gulf War illnesses, and recent vaccinees report symptoms> resembling Gulf War illnesses.”These illnesses, usually referred to as Gulf War Syndrome, are discussed infurther detail in chapter seven.It is claimed that B. anthracis is used in ‘biological weapons’; but theprocesses involved in creating ‘anthrax weapons’ are highly classified militarysecrets. However, these processes must involve extremely toxic substances,because no bacterium is a deadly pathogen.Any investigation to discover the real causes of ‘anthrax’ requires a discussionabout woolsorters’ disease, the symptoms of which include blood poisoning. Thisdisease was also known as splenic fever; it should be noted that the spleenfilters the blood.In England in the early 19th century, wool was a major industry but woolsortingwas not considered to be a particularly hazardous occupation; however, thischanged in the late 1830s. According to a 2004 article entitled The history ofwoolsorters’ disease: a Yorkshire beginning with an international future,> “…the national introduction of alpaca, mohair, and the various Eastern wools> in the 1830s quickly increased cases of bronchitis, pneumonia and deadly blood> poisoning within the woolsorters group.”The article claims that the first cases of woolsorters’ disease were reported in1838, but little progress was made in the ensuing decades to discover the causeof the problem, even though the number of deaths had begun to risesignificantly. Unfortunately, reports about Dr Koch’s ‘discovery’ of B.anthracis encouraged an investigation to ascertain whether woolsorters’ diseaseand anthrax were related. The article explains that experiments were conductedwhich showed that,> “…animals inoculated with blood from a fatal case of woolsorters’ disease died> of anthrax.”In an effort to demonstrate that these experiments provide definitive proof, thearticle also states,> “This important link with anthrax in cattle and sheep was finally confirmed> when cattle in Bradford died of anthrax after drinking water that had been> used to wash imported wool.”These cattle deaths do not provide confirmation that anthrax ‘spores’ were thecause; they do however, indicate poisoning, and suggest that the water thecattle drank contained toxic substances.The 2008 WHO report admits that the poor level of knowledge about anthrax leavesmany unanswered questions, one of which is,> “…how precisely do grazing and browsing animals acquire it?”This question is inexplicable from the perspective of the ‘germ theory’. It ishowever, fully explicable from the perspective of a ‘toxin’ or ‘poison; afterall, the ‘disease’ is acknowledged to be due to ‘toxins’. The medicalestablishment erroneously attributes the source of the toxins to be bacterial;the real sources are of a very different nature.The most significant toxin that can explain the early cases of woolsorters’disease is arsenic, which was the main ingredient of a sheep dip that had beendeveloped in 1830. Arsenic is discussed in more detail in the next chapter; itis, however, a persistent toxin. The use of arsenic in sheep dip has producedconsiderable environmental contamination, as indicated by an article entitledArsenic and Old Wool, which refers to various arsenic-based compounds that havebeen used as ingredients of sheep dip and states,> “The pervasive toxicity of these compounds is evidenced by the fact that old> sheep dip sites in Australia contaminated by arsenic are now considered a> threat to public health.”The article also indicates that The Lancet carried many reports during the 19thcentury about shepherds who suffered from the effects of the toxic sheep dip;but shepherds were not the only people exposed to the hazards of arsenic. Inaddition to shepherds and woolsorters, anyone who handled wool from sheep dippedin arsenic-based compounds would have been affected by this highly toxicsubstance. The rise of ‘bacteriology’ in the latter part of the 19th centuryensured, however, that little, if any, attention was paid to a toxicologicalinvestigation of the disease.Although a significant contributory factor, arsenic is not the only toxicsubstance that can account for the poisoning of grazing animals. As will befurther discussed in the next chapter, certain industries have released a widevariety of toxic substances into the environment; many of these contaminants areeminently capable of causing serious harm to the health of animals, includinglivestock.One industry in particular that has been associated with anthrax ‘outbreaks’ istanning; the WHO document states that,> “…the main enzootic livestock areas traditionally lay ‘downstream’ from> tanneries and the implication has been that watercourses have carried> contaminated tannery effluent…”The use of the word ‘contaminated’ is intended to indicate the existence ofanthrax spores from ‘infected’ animals; the alleged ‘contamination’ of hideswith anthrax spores is the reason that tannery workers were vaccinated againstthe disease. The real contamination would be from the use of toxic chemicals bythe tanning industry; these toxins included arsenic, as the Arsenic and Old Woolarticle states,> “White arsenic was further used as a preservative of hides, skins and furs.”Mining is another industry associated with the release of toxic substances thatcontaminate the environment. Tin mining, for example, is particularly hazardousbecause tin ore is usually found in association with sulphur and arsenic.Interestingly, tin mining was one of the industries in 19th century Yorkshire,the English county in which woolsorters’ disease arose.It is clear therefore, that exposure to highly toxic substances, especiallyarsenic used in sheep dip, provides a more compelling explanation forwoolsorters’ disease in humans; and that the contamination of grazing land withtoxic industrial effluent and toxins released from mining provides a morecompelling explanation for the animal disease known as anthrax.VivisectionThe Oxford Concise Medical Dictionary defines vivisection as,> “a surgical operation on a living animal for experimental purposes.”According to the NAVS (National Anti-Vivisection Society) web page entitledAreas of Science that Use Animals,> “The scope of animal use in science today includes virtually every field of> investigation.”The scientific fields that utilise vivisection are categorised by NAVS under thegeneral headings of research, testing and education.Investigations classified as ‘testing’ include experiments that are conducted toascertain the ‘safety’ of chemical ingredients used in manufactured products,many of which are everyday items used by millions of people around the world.The widespread use of chemicals is discussed in the next chapter; however,testing their safety clearly relies on the idea that it is only the dose thatmakes a substance toxic; an idea that has been shown to be false.The category of ‘education’ is self-explanatory and mainly involves thedissection of animals in classrooms.The category of ‘research’ covers a range of fields of study, as described bythe NAVS web page entitled Animals Used in Research,> “Animals are used in basic and biomedical research, behavioural research,> military research, agricultural research, veterinary research and drug> development and testing.”The types of research pertinent to this discussion mainly involve biomedicalresearch, drug development and drug testing, all of which can be combined underthe general heading of ‘medical research’. However, some of the arguments used,whether to support or object to animal experimentation in medical research, areapplicable to other types of research and to safety testing.The main justification for vivisection within medical research is that it isindispensable; it is claimed to be vital for the study of disease and for thedevelopment of effective drugs and vaccines to combat them. This argument isexpressed by Dr Hans Selye MD in his book entitled The Stress of Life,> “Yet, few antivivisectionists would consider it more ethical to stop medical> research altogether and thereby expose countless human beings to unnecessary> suffering.”This argument is encapsulated within the phrase ‘it’s the bunny or your baby’.However, nothing could be further from the truth. Although well-intentioned,this is a fallacious argument; no bunny has to be sacrificed in order to savebabies.Dr Selye, whose important study of the role of ‘stress’ is discussed in chapterten, was trained under the orthodox medical system that retains the belief in anumber of flawed theories about diseases and their causes. In addition to theidea that ‘germs’ are the causes of ‘infectious diseases’, is the idea that‘genes’ are relevant causal factors for a number of ‘non-infectious diseases’.But both of these ideas are erroneous; neither ‘germs’ nor ‘genes’ are thecauses of disease.A wide variety of animal experiments have been conducted to investigate both‘infectious’ and ‘non-infectious’ diseases over the course of many decades. Yet,there have been no significant reductions in morbidity or mortality; in fact,the statistics demonstrate that these problems are worsening. As indicated inthe discussion about iatrogenesis, drugs and vaccines do not offer solutions tohealth problems; instead they exacerbate ill-health.Anti-vivisection organisations such as NAVS correctly argue for medical researchwithout animal experiments; it is clearly unethical to inflict suffering onanimals during experiments designed to relieve human suffering. However,concentrating solely on the cruelty of animal experiments misses the core issue,which is that the theories on which most medical research is based arefundamentally flawed.Unfortunately, there is an almost complete lack of recognition of the fullextent of the flaws within the teachings of the medical establishment system;and also, to a certain extent, within those of the ‘alternative healthcommunity’. Although many physicians have recognised some of the problems, veryfew have recognised them all.However, although they support the idea that medical research is necessary,anti-vivisection organisations raise a number of valid objections to the use ofanimals for research purposes. The main objections are that animals sufferduring the experiments and that they have an unnatural life in the laboratoryenvironment.Another objection is that animals used in research are almost always killed atsome stage of the experiment; to counter this objection, medical researchersoften use the euphemism ‘sacrificed’ so that animal deaths are represented as ascientific necessity rather than cruelty. The reality is that, whether it occursbefore, during or afterwards, the overwhelming majority of animals are killed sothat researchers can examine them and determine the effects of the ‘experiment’they have conducted.It is probably true to say that medical researchers perform their work under theimpression that they are conducting ‘medical science’ and that it has a genuineand meaningful purpose; as expressed by Dr Selye, who refers to,> “…one of the noblest and most human aspirations of man, the desire to> understand himself.”Although the dissection of dead animals can permit an understanding of thephysiological effects of ‘disease’, it cannot generate an understanding ofdisease processes within a living body, whether human or animal. Furthermore, noexperimentation conducted on living, or dead, animals can take ‘man’ to a betterunderstanding of ‘himself’.Despite the belief that laboratory experimentation is an essential aspect ofresearch, there are many limitations to the experiments conducted in the name of‘medical science’, one of which is, as discussed in chapter three, the failureto appreciate that the procedures used in the preparation of specimens formicroscopy can directly affect the specimens, whether they are tissues, cells,disease molecules, bacteria or the particles called ‘viruses’.This limitation was acknowledged by Dr Harold Hillman, who stressed that many ofthe ‘structures’ observed under microscopes are, in reality, artefacts that havebeen produced by the preparation procedures such as fixation, for example. AnOctober 2011 article entitled Optimization of fixation methods for observationof bacterial cell morphology and surface ultrastructures by atomic forcemicroscopy discusses fixatives and fixation methods and makes the extremelyinteresting point that,> “The effects of different fixation methods on bacterial morphology were rarely> studied, and thus research gaps still remained in this issue.”It should be noted that fixatives often contain toxic chemicals such asformaldehyde, which will inevitably affect living specimens, especiallypleomorphic bacteria.Although this may not seem to be relevant to a discussion about vivisection, itserves to highlight the existence of research gaps and limitations withinmedical research. The NAVS web page entitled Animals Used in Research recognisesthe existence of certain limitations and states,> “Limitations of animal models are well documented, and reproducibility issues> with animal experiments remain an ongoing issue for the scientific community.”Reproducibility is considered to be an essential feature of scientificexperimentation.The existence of ‘research gaps’ is also recognised on the NAVS web page, whichstates that,> “…a large gap remains between experimental findings with animal experiments in> the lab and the intended application of this information in the clinic.”This ‘gap’ is immensely significant; it completely undermines the fundamentalbelief that animal experiments are vital to the furtherance of an understandingof human disease, and to the development of suitable ‘treatments’.The existence of these limitations and research gaps demonstrates thatconclusions drawn from laboratory-based animal experiments are, at best, highlyquestionable, even from the perspective of the medical establishment. Inreality, these gaps and limitations expose a poor level of understanding about‘disease’; a situation that has been acknowledged by published ‘peer-reviewed’study articles, as demonstrated by the numerous articles quoted throughout thisbook. Many of the cited articles admit that certain key aspects of the sciencerelevant to the subject of the study are ‘unknown’, ‘poorly understood’ or even‘rarely studied’.Nevertheless, the ‘information’ about diseases published by health organisationssuch as the WHO, CDC, NIH, NHS etc, implies that the ‘medical establishment’ isfully cognisant of all aspects of all diseases, including their causes and theappropriate methods with which to manage and treat them; the discussions in thisbook demonstrate otherwise.Another limitation to the use of animal experimentation in the study of diseaseis that only certain effects can be observed and objectively measured; asexplained by the authors of Chemical Exposures who state that,> “…rats, mice and other animals are unable to tell researchers if they have> headaches, feel depressed or anxious or are nauseated.”These, and many other relevant but non-measurable effects, remain unknown toresearchers.The existence of non-measurable effects is significant for animal experimentsconducted to determine the ‘safe dose’ of chemicals. Animals cannot express manyof the effects they experience; therefore, researchers cannot know all of theeffects produced by any chemical.As the discussions in this book demonstrate, the environment in the real worldis very different from that of the sanitised laboratory, in which the conditionsare strictly controlled and animals are usually only exposed to singlesubstances. In the real world, people as well as all other living organisms, areexposed to multiple substances simultaneously and in varying combinations, noneof which has been thoroughly tested to determine the full range of theireffects.Although most remain untested, a small percentage of substances have been testedmore thoroughly than others, and an even smaller percentage of substances havebeen tested in a few limited combinations. The results from these tests have,however, demonstrated the existence of synergistic interactions between somesubstances. One substance in particular that reacts synergistically with certainothers is mercury; as explained in the book entitled Uninformed Consent, inwhich the authors quote the words of Dr Boyd Haley PhD who states,> “…the determination of safe body levels of mercury by using animal data, where> the animals have not been exposed to other heavy metals, is no longer> justified. Mercury is far more toxic to individuals when other heavy metals> are present.”Medical research experiments that are intended to ascertain the safety of a drugsuffer from the same limitations as those for chemical testing. The ingredientsof pharmaceuticals are chemicals, which interact with a variety of otherchemicals and many of these interactions may be synergistic. The lack of testingof all possible combinations of all substances means however, that there is amajor knowledge gap, with respect to all of the effects that may be produced byinteractions between the many hundreds of thousands of chemicals that nowpervade the environment.Animal research experiments are also conducted to determine the efficacy of adrug and its ability to alleviate a particular disease; but the limitedknowledge about the effects of the drugs on animals means that their effects onhumans remain unknown, until the drug reaches the human testing phase ofclinical trials. It is claimed to be unethical to experiment on humans; however,clinical trials cannot be regarded in any other way than as human experiments.In the case of drug trials, people should not be poisoned in the mistaken beliefthat they are testing ‘medicine’.Another justification for the use of animals is that they are ‘lesser beings’,and therefore different from, humans; yet vivisection is justified on the basisthat animals are sufficiently similar to humans to qualify as ‘suitable models’for the study of human disease. This is a blatant contradiction.One of the most significant objections to animal experimentation is that animalsare not suitable models for studying human diseases. Each type of animal isphysiologically different from all other types of animal, as well as beingdifferent from humans; this point is explained by Dr Russell Blaylock in Healthand Nutrition Secrets,> “Many animals have physiological and biochemical systems quite different than> humans…”These physiological and biochemical differences mean that conclusions drawn fromanimal experiments cannot be reliably extrapolated as if they are meaningful forhuman disease studies. Nevertheless, although the results are recognised to be‘approximations’, medical research studies contain conclusions that are claimedto assist the development of knowledge about diseases and the appropriatemeasures with which to ‘treat’ them.The problem with vivisection in medical research is described by Dr MoneimFadali MD, who is firm in his condemnation of the practice, and is quoted byHans Ruesch in his book entitled 1000 Doctors (And Many More) AgainstVivisection, to have stated that,> “Animal model systems differ from their human counterparts. Conclusions drawn> from animal research, when applied to human beings, are likely to delay> progress, mislead, and do harm to the patient. Vivisection, or animal> experimentation, should be abolished.”There is a fundamental error in the assumption that an artificial environmentcreated in a laboratory can simulate the environment within a living organism;this point is also discussed by Hans Ruesch who also quotes bacteriologist ReneDubos from his own book entitled Mirage of Health,> “The experimenter does not produce nature in the laboratory.”It may be argued that researchers recognise this fact; nevertheless, theybelieve that the laboratory provides a sufficient approximation of nature andthat this enables them to produce adequate experimental ‘evidence’ that can bereliably extrapolated and applied to the human body. These are erroneous beliefsand assumptions.Nevertheless, in the belief that it is more ethical to experiment on animalsthan on humans, researchers use many types of animals; rats and mice are themost common, although others include cats, dogs, frogs, rabbits, hamsters,guinea pigs and monkeys. It may be assumed that the preference for rats and miceis because they are suitable approximations for the study of human disease; butthis is not the case. Rodents are used because they are cheap, small and easy tohandle, as Dr Selye admits,> “Rodents also have the advantage of being small, inexpensive and singularly> resistant to infections which make them especially suitable for large-scale> experimentation.”Dr Selye is by no means the only physician to acknowledge that rodents are usedfor these reasons; but that does not make them suitable or even approximateanimal models. Furthermore, the reference to rodents being ‘singularly resistantto infections’ indicates that from the perspective of ‘germs’, the rodentresponse differs from the human response; a situation that raises seriousquestions about the relevance of any rodent-based research for the study ofhuman ‘infectious diseases’.In fact, rodents possess a number of significant physiological differences fromhumans, one of which is that humans have a gall bladder, but rats do not; thismeans that rats digest fats differently from humans. Another difference is thatrodents manufacture Vitamin B in their appendix, whereas humans do so in theirliver. Another difference is that humans do not manufacture vitamin C butrodents do. A further difference is that rats and mice cannot vomit, which meansthat they process and expel toxins from their bodies differently from humans.These differences clearly raise even more questions about the suitability of anymember of the rodent family for medical research purposes.It may be suggested that primates would be far more suitable animal models forthe study of human disease, on the basis that they share many similarities withhumans and are far closer to man ‘genetically’. However, although primates areused in some experiments, they are not more suitable models for the purposes ofhuman disease research. Professor Vernon Reynolds, a primatologist and professorof biological anthropology, provides his response to this suggestion withreference to man’s closest primate ‘relative’, the chimpanzee. On the website ofthe Vivisection Information Network, on the page entitled Medical quotes, he isquoted as stating that,> “No chimps ... have been of any use in the experiments they were used for ...> The whole wretched business (and it is big business) should be stopped and> stopped now.”One of the most fundamental points that needs to be emphasised is, that using ananimal as a model for investigating a particular human disease would only berelevant if the animal also suffered from the disease under investigation; butthis is not the case. In fact, research studies often require the disease to beartificially induced in the laboratory animal; the methods employed to do thisfrequently involve the use of chemicals that are known to be toxic and the causeof illness. In the study of ‘genetic diseases’, the methods can involve the useof radiation to produce mutations that are claimed to resemble certain diseases,especially cancers.It is claimed that disease conditions are induced in order to facilitate thestudy of various pharmaceutical chemicals, to discover if any have the potentialfor development into a ‘treatment’. It is also assumed that the animal responsewill be indicative of, or at least similar to, the human response, should thedrug reach the stage of human clinical trials, in which the human response isinvestigated. But, as previously discussed, unintended reactions are labelled‘side effects’, whereas, in reality, all reactions are direct effects.These artificial methods of inducing disease in animals are claimed to beuseful, even though it is admitted that they do not produce exactly the same‘disease’ conditions that are suffered by humans. However, this exposes one ofthe major problems with the medical establishment understanding of ‘disease’;the idea that there are distinct disease conditions is fundamentally flawed. Aswill be explained and discussed in detail in chapter ten, people do not sufferfrom the same diseases; a fact that undermines all disease-based medicalresearch studies.The use of chemicals and radiation to induce ‘disease’ in animals is a clearindication that these are relevant, and highly significant, factors in thecausation of ill-health.Organisations such as NAVS have stated unequivocally that no animal species issuitable for the study of human disease, and that humans are the onlyappropriate models. This important point is also explained by Professor PietroCroce, a former vivisectionist, who states, in his book entitled Vivisection orScience: A Choice to Make, that,> “Even the choice between different species of animal is illusory: actually one> is not even speaking of there being a choice at all, but of a kind of fishing> blindly among different possibilities in a haphazard way or, worse, according> to opportunistic criteria in deciding which animal is more or less convenient:> the mouse, the rabbit, the guinea pig are ‘convenient’ because they are easy> to keep; cats and dogs because they are easily and cheaply obtainable:> everything except the one element which ought to be the deciding factor: an> animal having morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics> applicable to man. However, such an animal can only be man himself.”This argument should not be interpreted as a justification for humanexperimentation.It should be clear from the discussion in this section, that neither humans noranimals should be used for any experimental research purposes, including medicalresearch that attempts to understand disease, but cannot do so because it isbased on fundamentally flawed theories that are unsupported by empiricalevidence.Unfortunately, one of the reasons that animal experimentation continues isunrelated to notions of altruism, or the belief that the medical establishmentwill find the cures for all of mankind’s ailments eventually, given enough timeand money. Hans Ruesch is one of the many scientists and researchers who haveobjected to vivisection over the course of many decades; he encapsulates part ofthe underlying problem in the following powerful statement,> “The investigator, who dares to question the official brainwashing that human> or animal health was in the past, or currently, or will, in the future be> based on vivisection, can quickly and easily arrive at the truth, which is> increasingly well-documented. If vivisection is to survive, the public must be> kept ignorant of the truth. There is no money in hygiene or prevention. The> unscientific and obscene institution of vivisection is protected and promoted> solely by those in big business who make fortunes from it at the expense of> true medicine.”The important role of ‘hygiene’ is discussed in chapter ten, in which it will beshown that no ‘medicine’ is required for health.Furthermore, the influence of ‘big business’ within the medical establishment,and especially within ‘medical science’, is discussed in detail in chapter nine.Although discussions in previous chapters have referred to some of the causes ofcertain diseases, the next chapter discusses in greater detail the major factorsthat contribute to, and even directly cause, a great deal of human illness andsuffering."},{"pageContent":"> 6. Poisoning The Planet: Science Gone Awry> “We live on a planet that has become the repository for the products,> emissions and wastes of modern industry.” Joe Thornton The discussions in the previous chapters have demonstrated that the medicalestablishment theories about ‘disease’ are flawed; that medicines do not curedisease; that vaccines do not prevent disease; and that ‘germs’ do not causedisease.It is argued throughout this book that ‘science’ is a process and that existingscientific theories ought to remain open to reassessment and revision, and evenbe abandoned should new evidence be discovered that refutes their assertions;the evidence is primary. A theory is essentially an attempt to explain aphenomenon; however, each phenomenon may contain a number of different aspects,some or all of which may have been proven to be ‘true’ and shown to be supportedby empirical evidence. Whilst the theory, as an interpretation of thephenomenon, may remain open to debate, aspects that have been demonstrated to be‘true’ cannot remain subject to debate.It is widely believed that scientific theories are highly technical and beyondthe ability of the general public to understand; this attitude generates therecommendation that the public must therefore ‘trust the experts’. However,statements made by certain ‘experts’ can often be at variance with statementsmade by equally qualified ‘experts’; these contrasting and often conflictingviews are a source of much confusion for people.Unfortunately, it is increasingly common for experts who challenge theestablishment view about a particular topic to be vilified by the mainstreammedia, and even denied the opportunity to present and explain their theories.This means that the general public will not be fully informed about all aspectsof the topic in question, but instead will receive biased information,especially if the mainstream media is their only source of ‘information’. Thisdoes not necessarily mean, however, that the establishment view is correct. Thereasons for such obfuscation as well as the problems with the mainstream mediaand the vested interests behind the promulgation of biased ‘scientific evidence’are discussed in more detail in chapter nine.The ‘environment’ has become one of the dominant issues of public concern;unfortunately, discussions about this topic focus almost exclusively on ‘climatechange’ rather than environmental pollution. Although it is widely acknowledgedthat the environment of the planet at the beginning of the 21st century ispolluted, there are many differing opinions about the extent of the pollution,the nature of the pollutants and the appropriate measures required to addressthe problem.One aspect that is inadequately covered in discussions about the environment isthe extent to which pollution contributes to ill-health. Although the medicalestablishment theories about disease are flawed, they do recognise, albeit to alimited extent, that certain ‘toxins’ are environmental pollutants thatcontribute to certain diseases; this means that they recognise the existence ofan association between the health of the environment and the health of thepeople who inhabit that environment. This association is recognised by the WHOand discussed in their March 2016 report entitled Preventing disease throughhealthy environments, which will be referred to in this and later chapters asthe Healthy environments report, the purpose of which is to recommendappropriate policy measures for implementation by all WHO Member States. Thesepolicies are claimed to be able to improve public health through interventionsin the environment, as outlined in the Preface that states,> “Our evolving knowledge about environment-health interactions will support the> design of more effective public health strategies and interventions, directed> at eliminating health hazards and reducing corresponding risks to health.”Unfortunately, knowledge about ‘environment-health interactions’ will never becomplete whilst the medical establishment remains committed to flawed theoriesabout the nature of the hazards that threaten public health and the appropriatemeasures with which to address them. No policies, strategies or interventionsthat are based on flawed theories can effectively improve public health.The Healthy environments report claims that environmental hazards significantlyimpact both morbidity and mortality; the severity of the problem is stated to bethat approximately 23% of all deaths and approximately 22% of the global burdenof disease are attributable to ‘the environment’. It is stated that, in thecontext of the report, the definition of ‘environmental risks to health’ refersto,> “all the physical, chemical and biological factors external to a person...”The category of ‘biological factors’ refers to bacteria, viruses, fungi andparasites; in other words, ‘germs’, all of which are claimed to be more easily‘transmitted’ as the result of certain environmental conditions. However,‘germs’ are not the causes of disease, which means that they are notenvironmental risks to health.A far more significant factor that contributes to and exacerbates the problem ofenvironmental pollution is the plethora of substances used to eradicate the‘germs’ erroneously claimed to pose health risks. The ‘interventions’ used forthis purpose are invariably toxic; they therefore increase the risks to health;they do not reduce them. It is important in the context of this discussion toreiterate that a ‘poison’ is defined as,> “any substance that irritates, damages or impairs activity of the body’s> tissues”.It should be noted that irritation, damaged tissues and impaired activity aresome of the many symptoms attributable to ‘disease’. It is also important toreiterate the point that the toxic substances employed to combat ‘germs’ orother ‘pests’ are not specific to their target; they have the ability toadversely affect all living organisms exposed to them.The category of ‘physical factors’ is not clearly defined by the WHO; however,the Heathy environments report refers to built environments and infrastructureand their association with matters such as sanitation and the supply of cleanwater; unclean water and poor sanitation certainly pose risks to health.Unfortunately, however, the WHO claims that the risks they pose are because theyprovide breeding grounds for ‘germs’, which are the sources of ‘infection’ andthe causes of a variety of infectious diseases. The inappropriate measures thathave been introduced to address unclean water and poor sanitation are discussedlater in this chapter and in chapter eight.The report also refers to building materials as ‘physical factors’ that can poserisks to health; one of the toxic substances specifically mentioned is asbestos,which is acknowledged to be a causal factor for some forms of cancer, especiallymesothelioma.The report correctly recognises that ‘chemical factors’ pose risks to health,and acknowledges that certain chemicals have been associated with certaindiseases, especially cancers, but substantially understates the extent to whichtoxic chemicals contribute to environmental pollution and human illness.According to the Healthy environments report, the solutions to the problemscaused by ‘chemical factors’ should include,> “...safer, more judicious use and management of toxic substances at home and> in the workplace.”This solution is woefully inadequate; the mere ‘management’ of toxic substancesin the home and the workplace will not solve the fundamental problem, which isthat, as Joe Thornton succinctly describes in the quote that opens this chapter,the planet ‘has become the repository for the products, emissions and wastes ofmodern industry’.The only genuine solution to a problem is one that will address the root cause.The issue is not, however, simply a matter of the injudicious use of chemicalsor the failure to create and enforce effective regulations; it is far deeper, aswill be further discussed in this chapter and in chapter nine.One of the main problems with respect to toxic chemicals, is that they have beenproduced and used on the basis of the belief that they are safe, because it isonly the dose that makes a substance a poison. This erroneous belief has hadprofound consequences for the health of the environment and inevitably for thehealth of all living organisms that inhabit that environment; in other words,for all life on Earth. However, although significant, chemicals are not the onlyenvironmental pollutants; others include electromagnetic radiation, bothionising and non-ionising, as will be discussed in this chapter.Despite the recognition that there is an association between certain toxicchemicals and illness, a large proportion of diseases are attributed to either‘germs’ or ‘genes’; which means that toxicological testing is rarely used as adiagnostic tool for determining the causes of disease. The main reason thattoxicology is not used for this purpose is the general denial that toxicchemicals are related in any significant degree to illness. This denial is basedon two factors, one of which is the belief in the Paracelsus fallacy relating tothe dose. The other factor is that it is extremely difficult to demonstrate adirect link between exposure to a single chemical and a resulting illness in thereal-world environment because people are always exposed to multiple chemicals.This difficulty is exploited by industry and used to support the denial thattheir products cause illness; a pertinent example is the tobacco industry’sdenial over the course of many decades that smoking contributed to cancer.Eventually, however, sufficient evidence accumulated to dispel the doubts and toestablish a clear link between smoking and an increased risk of lung cancer.One reason that it is virtually impossible to demonstrate a direct link betweena specific chemical and a specific ‘disease’ is that, in reality, there are noseparate and distinct disease entities with distinct causes. Another is thatillness rarely has a single cause; it is almost always the result of a complexmix of factors. These topics are discussed in greater detail in chapter ten.The failure to recognise the full extent to which toxic chemicals contribute toenvironmental pollution is the result of a combination of factors, one of whichis that only a tiny proportion of all manufactured chemicals are tested fortheir safety. Another is that the testing procedures are not comprehensive; onlya limited range of effects are evaluated. Furthermore, testing procedures aremainly limited to investigations of the effects from individual substances or,very rarely, to the possible effects from a few combinations of substances.The most significant aspect of the problem is that no tests are ever conductedto assess the safety, or otherwise, of the myriad combinations of the thousandsof chemicals to which people can be exposed on a daily basis in the real world.One of the reasons that comprehensive testing is not conducted is explained byPeter Montague of the Environmental Research Foundation in his May 1999 articleentitled The Waning Days of Risk Assessment, in which he states that,> “Science has no way to analyze the effects of multiple exposures...”Effects produced by exposures to multiple substances within a complex livinghuman body cannot be analysed and tested in laboratory experiments that onlyexamine tissues, cells, molecules and other fragments extracted from a livingorganism. The inability of ‘science’ to test these effects on an intact livinghuman organism means that assurances of ‘safety’ cannot be relied upon.The difficulties in establishing an association between exposures to multipleenvironmental pollutants and a specific disease are also discussed in a 2003article entitled Environmental pollution and the global burden of disease. Thisarticle, which is published in the British Medical Bulletin, states that,> “Long latency times, the effects of cumulative exposures, and multiple> exposures to different pollutants which might act synergistically all create> difficulties in unravelling associations between environmental pollution and> health.”These ‘difficulties’ are obviously beneficial for polluting industries andenable them to avoid taking responsibility for their contributions to thedegradation of the environment and the resulting ill-health suffered by thepublic.The article claims that the major sources of ‘environmental pollution’ areunsafe water, poor sanitation and poor hygiene; but, in the 21st century, theseconditions are largely the result of environmental pollution not their source.It was demonstrated in chapter two that the implementation of a number ofsanitary measures in the 19th century substantially contributed to improvedhealth, but these measures did not completely eradicate all illness; which meansthat other factors must also have been involved. The majority of 21st centurypollutants differ from those of the 19th century and, to a certain extent, thesedifferences are reflected in the different types of ‘disease’ with which peoplenow suffer.Unfortunately, the flawed understanding about the nature and causes of diseasesmeans that the medical establishment refers to diseases as either ‘infectious’or ‘non-infectious’ as indicated by the Healthy environments report, whichstates that,> “The last decade has seen a shift away from infectious, parasitic and> nutritional disease to NCDs...”Strangely, however, and in contrast to this statement, is a claim made in anOctober 2014 article entitled Global rise in human infectious disease outbreaks,published by the Journal of the Royal Society Interface, which states that,> “Zoonotic disease outbreaks are increasing globally in both total number and> richness...”The Royal Society is as much a part of the ‘establishment’ as the WHO, whichmakes these contrasting statements a matter of concern; they also raise thequestion of how such contradictions can be justified when one of the mainobjectives of the ‘establishment’ is to achieve a ‘consensus’ view with respectto their theories.It is abundantly clear that, whatever the label applied to the conditions withwhich they suffer, increasing numbers of people around the world areexperiencing worsening health; but the medical establishment is unable toeffectively ‘treat’ these problems and help people recover their health.One of the ‘physical factors’ referred to in the Healthy environments reportrequires further discussion because it is regarded as the major ‘environmentalproblem’ of the 21st century. This factor is ‘climate change’, which the reportclaims to be an emerging risk that needs to be tackled urgently. The relevanceof ‘climate change’ to health is claimed to be that certain factors that relateto infectious diseases are ‘climate sensitive’; this claim is, however, highlyproblematic.The topic of ‘climate change’ is a controversial one; mainly due to the ideas ofthe scientific establishment about the causes of changes in the climate. Themain claims are that unprecedented levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide haveadversely affected the climate and that human activity is largely to blame forthis situation; but these claims are unfounded. This is not to deny that theclimate changes; that is an irrefutable fact. Climate change is a naturalphenomenon that has occurred throughout the existence of the planet. The pointof dispute is that it has never been proven that the level of atmospheric carbondioxide is the driving force behind changes in the climate, or that humanactivity is the most significant contributory factor to the total volume ofcarbon dioxide in the atmosphere.Although carbon dioxide is regarded as a greenhouse gas, it is by no means themost abundant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere; it is, however, the only gasthat has been accused since the 1980s of causing ‘global warming’, a label thatwas altered to ‘climate change’ when global temperature readings ceased tosupport the notion that the planet was experiencing unprecedented ‘warming’.It is an acknowledged scientific fact that ‘human emissions’ form only a smallfraction of the total volume of atmospheric carbon dioxide, which itself formsonly a small percentage of the total volume of ‘greenhouse gases’. Nevertheless,it is claimed that the contribution from ‘human emissions’ creates a ‘dangerous’level of carbon dioxide; a claim that is refuted by palaeoclimatologistProfessor Robert M Carter PhD, who states in his book entitled Climate: TheCounter Consensus that,> “Though we know little about the transient effect of human emissions, there is> little reason to suspect that the effect is dangerous.”Carbon dioxide is not the ‘dangerous’ villain it is purported to be; on thecontrary, Professor Carter states that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxidehave been shown to be beneficial and explains that,> “Increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide both enhances plant growth and aids the> efficiency of water use.”Professor Carter is by no means alone in his recognition that atmospheric carbondioxide is beneficial for plant growth; as demonstrated by a 2009 fact sheetentitled Carbon Dioxide in Greenhouses produced by OMAFRA (Ontario Ministry ofAgriculture, Food and Rural Affairs), which states that,> “The benefits of carbon dioxide supplementation on plant growth and production> within the greenhouse environment have been well understood for years.”Carbon dioxide is essential for photosynthesis, which is a vital aspect of plantgrowth. This means that carbon dioxide is vital for life on planet Earth as manyliving organisms depend on plants for their food, either directly or indirectly;high levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide benefits plant growth and thereforeincreases the food supply.Unfortunately, whilst the attention of the public is focused on the idea thatcarbon dioxide is ‘bad’ and the primary cause of ‘climate change’, the far moreimportant and serious issue of environmental pollution is ignored. The portrayalof carbon dioxide as the ‘villain’ of environmental pollution has become adiversionary tactic to avoid sufficient media attention to expose the realvillains, which are the plethora of toxic substances that pollute theenvironment.It is often claimed that people who ‘deny’ climate change are funded by the oilindustry to help promote their cause; the discussions in this chapter willdemonstrate that the oil industry is a major polluter of the environment; thisclaim cannot therefore be applied to the authors of this book.The very real and urgent problem that faces humanity is environmental pollutioncaused by the products, emissions and wastes of a wide variety of industries, asthis chapter will demonstrate.It must be emphasised that this discussion should not be interpreted as apolemic against ‘industry’ expressed from a ‘Luddite’ perspective, in which allindustry is viewed as ‘bad’. It is, however, a critique of the direction takenby many industries in respect of the processes and materials they create andutilise, as well as the irresponsible discharge of toxic industrial wastes. Thesentiment of the authors of this book is described in Ralph Nader’s bookentitled In Pursuit of Justice in which he quotes the words of conservationistDavid Brower, who states that,> “We’re not blindly opposed to progress, we’re opposed to blind progress.”There is no easily discernible point in history when efforts to understand theworld and how it functions developed into efforts to control and dominate theworld and its resources; the process seems to have undergone a slow butinsidious progression. Activities that began as the utilisation of resources foreveryday life, somehow developed into a full-scale exploitation of resources bycertain groups of people in the belief that they had an inalienable right toexploit those resources, without regard or responsibility for the consequencesof their actions.In addition to the exploitation of natural resources by industry in general, thechemical industry in particular has created a wide variety of new substancesthat could never have developed naturally; this makes it difficult, if notimpossible, for them to degrade naturally. Dr Barry Commoner PhD expresses thispoint in his book entitled Making Peace With the Planet,> “Organic compounds incapable of enzymatic degradation are not produced in> living things.”In this context, ‘organic’ means carbon-based. Enzymatic degradation is theprocess by which matter is broken down into its individual chemical components.If the matter is organic, these chemical components are reabsorbed into theenvironment where they are ‘recycled’ by various organisms, including bacteria.The ever-growing volume of non-organic compounds that do not biodegradenaturally is a key factor in the ever-growing level of environmental pollution.It is no understatement to assert that science has been largely, although notcompletely, corrupted by those who seek to control and exploit the world’sresources for their own narrow benefits, rather than to understand theimportance of the maintenance of natural resources to ensure the perpetuation oflife on Earth. Warnings about the dire consequences of the arrogant attitude ofthose who seek to control and exploit nature, have been expressed by manyconcerned people from various walks of life over a long period of time. One ofthose warnings was articulated over half a century ago by Rachel Carson in herbook entitled Silent Spring,> “As man proceeds towards his announced goal of the conquest of nature, he has> written a depressing record of destruction, directed not only against the> earth he inhabits but against the life that shares it with him.”Although her book is primarily a discussion about the dangers of toxicpesticides, Rachel Carson’s words are equally applicable to various disciplinesin which mankind seeks the ‘conquest of nature’, particularly by the manufactureof unnatural and dangerous chemicals and the generation of EM radiation. PeterMontague refers in his previously cited 1999 article to the level of awarenessof the problem that existed in the 1970s,> “Technical mastery of natural forces was leading not to safety and well being,> but to a careless and accelerating dispersal of dangerous poisons into the> biosphere with consequences impossible to predict.”Sadly, the situation has yet to change for the better in the interveningdecades; in most instances the situation has substantially worsened. One majorexample is that with the development of nuclear weapons, mankind has taken thedesire for control to its ultimate limit and created the ability to completelydestroy the entire world; an event in which no one could ever be the winner.This is also articulated by Peter Montague in his article, in which he statesthat,> “During the late 1960s it slowly became clear that many modern technologies> had far surpassed human understanding, giving rise to by-products that were> dangerous, long-lived and completely unanticipated.”It is impossible in a single chapter to enumerate and detail all the ways inwhich the world has been, and continues to be, polluted and poisoned. Such achapter would not only be long and cumbersome, but it would also be thoroughlydepressing. The aim of this book is to inform, not to depress, and so thischapter focuses on providing information about pollutants and toxins, some ofwhich are discussed in detail, for the purpose of demonstrating their widespreadnature in everyday life and to assist people to avoid, or at least minimise,exposure to them.The fact that people survive and are able to live despite constant exposures toa barrage of toxic substances is a testament to the body’s self-regulating andself-healing mechanisms. However, whilst it is essential to bear in mindthroughout this chapter that the human body is amazingly resilient, it must alsobe recognised that there are limits to the body’s ability to withstandincreasing levels of toxic intake; these limits are manifested in the seriousnature of the diseases with which increasing numbers of people around the worldnow suffer.This situation can be changed, but only when people have a genuine understandingof the real causes of illness, so that they can make informed decisions aboutmatters that affect their health. However, informed decisions can only be madewhen people are in possession of all the relevant information about the‘poisons’ to which they are exposed and can therefore avoid; providing thisinformation is the core purpose of this chapter.Natural PoisonsThe medical establishment claims that some diseases have an ancient origin. Thebasis for such claims is that archaeological excavations have occasionallyuncovered skeletal remains that are believed to exhibit certain pathologiesindicative of certain diseases.Although this book argues that there are no distinct ‘disease entities’, it isnot disputed that ‘diseased conditions’ have existed throughout human history.Unfortunately, the ancient origin of ‘disease’ is frequently used as an argumentagainst the idea that ‘chemicals’ can be responsible for causing disease, on thebasis that the chemical industry is a relatively recent phenomenon; this ishowever a misleading argument.The Earth is comprised of many different materials, some of which occurnaturally in their elemental form, others occur only within compounds and arenever found in nature in their elemental form. Many of these elements andcompounds are beneficial for life; without these essential substances the richvariety of life-forms that exist on the planet would never have been able todevelop and thrive over the course of Earth’s history.There are, however, a number of natural substances that are inherently harmfulto living organisms; some of them are harmful in their elemental form but onlyoccur in nature within a harmless compound. Others are harmful in the form inwhich they occur in nature, but remain deep within subterranean layers, wherethey are relatively harmless unless disturbed by events that precipitate theirrelease.Certain natural phenomena can precipitate the release of harmful substances intothe environment; volcanic eruptions, for example, discharge huge volumes ofminerals and gases from deep within the bowels of the earth. Volcanic eruptionsdo not directly cause disease, but they do introduce toxic substances into theatmosphere; it is these toxic materials that are able to spread to populatedareas and cause widespread illness and death. Other natural phenomena can alsocontribute to increased levels of environmental pollution; the discussion inchapter four about the Black Death demonstrated that comet debris contains manytoxic materials that are capable of polluting the Earth’s environment andcausing devastating illness and death. Hazardous materials are also releasedinto the environment from natural processes, for example, the breakdown ofradioactive materials such as uranium into their decay by-products; the healthhazards from exposure to ionising radiation are discussed in more detail laterin this chapter.These natural phenomena clearly have an ancient origin; by comparison,human-generated pollution of the planet as the result of the exploitation ofEarth’s resources is an extremely recent phenomenon in geological terms.Human activities have however, augmented the level of ‘natural’ hazardousmaterials in the environment; the oldest of these activities include theextraction of natural resources by mining and quarrying, both of which haveorigins that date back many millennia. Some of the minerals that have beendiscovered to be useful for human activities occur in nature within an ore,which means that the elemental mineral requires extraction from that ore; thisled to the development of smelting processes, of which there are a few differenttypes. However, mining, quarrying and smelting are all hazardous occupations;they involve substantial exposures to some highly toxic substances.Prior to the commencement of these activities there was no knowledge about theirpotential hazards; nor, it would seem, were any investigations conducted to testthe possibility that they may be associated with any hazards or adverse healtheffects. However, effects would have been noticed by those who were engaged insuch activities, but their health problems may not have been directly associatedwith their occupations. Although men who worked in the mines, quarries andsmelting works would have been exposed to the greatest levels of hazardousmaterials, they were not the only people to be affected. People who lived in thevicinity of these works would also have been exposed to toxic wastes andby-products released into the environment and into local sources of water.These topics are discussed in more detail in the ensuing sections that discussfour naturally-occurring but highly toxic substances, namely, lead, mercury,arsenic and uranium. The reasons for choosing these four elements are becausethey are extremely toxic and because they have all been used in a variety ofapplications, some of which can only be described as wholly inappropriate.LeadThe establishment definition of lead refers to,> “a soft bluish-grey metallic element that forms several poisonous compounds.”Lead usually exists in nature within an ore and in conjunction with other metalsincluding zinc, silver and copper. The ore is mined then smelted to separate andextract the different metals. It is reported that both lead mining and smeltinghave long histories that date back more than three millennia. It is alsoreported that lead has been recognised as toxic for at least two millennia, asrecorded by Sheldon Rampton and John Stauber in their book entitled Trust UsWe’re Experts,> “... lead has been a known poison since antiquity. During the first century> AD, lead miners strapped animal bladders over their mouths as a way to avoid> inhaling it.”The Romans were known to have used lead in their water pipes, which suggeststhat they may not have been fully aware of its dangers. The ancient Greeks,however, were aware of the problem, as explained by Dr Herbert Needleman MD, inhis 2004 article entitled Lead Poisoning,> “Warnings of lead’s poisonous properties extend at least as far back as the> second century BC, when Nikander, a Greek physician, described the colic and> paralysis that followed lead ingestion. The early victims of lead toxicity> were mainly lead workers and wine drinkers.”It is unsurprising that lead workers were early victims of lead’s toxicity; leadminers are likely to have been the first to experience the adverse healtheffects from their exposures in the mines. The inclusion of wine drinkers asvictims of lead poisoning is, however, rather more surprising; but is explainedby Dr Needleman who states that lead was used in wine-making due to its ‘sweetflavour’ that would counteract the astringency of the tannic acid in the grapes.The use of lead in wine-making ceased many centuries ago; but its ability to addsweetness and colour made it a useful ingredient of foodstuffs in more recenteras. In England during the 18th and 19th centuries, for example, lead was usedas a red dye for children’s sweets; its sweetness again masking its dangers. Itwould seem that English physicians were not aware of the work of Nikander or thedangers of lead, because colic and paralysis were rarely ascribed to leadpoisoning.Lead was eventually recognised to be toxic and one product in particular wasmanufactured to specifically take advantage of this property; the insecticidelead arsenate. This chemical compound was first used at the end of the 19thcentury in America as a method of destroying the gypsy moth, which is not nativeto the US but, in its leaf-eating caterpillar stage, had become a severenuisance, particularly to fruit growers. It was claimed that lead arsenate had‘low phytotoxicity’, which was believed to mean that it would not harm theplants even though it would poison and kill the caterpillars. Based on thisclaim, lead arsenate became a popular insecticide and was used on a variety ofcrops, including rubber and coffee, as well as fruit trees.Lead arsenate was also available in other countries; it is reported to have beenused in Canada and Australia, as well as some parts of Europe and some Africancountries. The claim that lead arsenate had ‘low phytotoxicity’ was clearlyfalse; both lead and arsenic are highly toxic substances. This means that theinsect targets of the insecticide were not the only victims of poisoning;orchard and plantation workers would also have been exposed to these poisons.Furthermore, insecticide spraying after the development of the fruit is likelyto have left chemical residues on the crops, thus poisoning anyone who ate them.Residues would also have settled on the ground and contaminated the soil inwhich the trees and other crops were grown.Lead arsenate does degrade, albeit very slowly, into its constituent elements,lead and arsenic; however, lead and arsenic are both persistent poisons, whichmeans that any land previously used as orchards and plantations, on which leadarsenate had been used, will remain contaminated for a long time, even thoughthe pesticide is no longer used.One of the more recent and better-known applications of lead is as a motor fueladditive as it had been found to have a number of ‘useful’ properties, one ofwhich is that it boosts the performance of the fuel. Lead was also found to have‘useful’ properties for paints, one of which was the ability to hasten thedrying process; lead was used as a paint additive for many decades.Dr Needleman demonstrated that a clear association existed between exposure tolead and serious health hazards; his efforts over the course of many yearsfinally resulted in the removal of lead from the manufacture of most motor fuelsand most paints. He had discovered that children in particular suffered as theresult of exposures to lead; many of the adverse health effects they experiencedwere cognitive issues, including behavioural issues and developmental problemsas well as lowered IQ. The serious impact of lead poisoning has been found tooccur at very low levels of exposure. Former neurosurgeon Dr Russell Blaylock MDdiscusses in Health and Nutrition Secrets the neurological dangers to childrenfrom lead exposure,> “Several studies have shown that lead-intoxicated children experience> intellectual difficulties, as well as problems with hyper-irritability and> violent outbursts.”The WHO has also recognised this problem and states in the August 2018 factsheet entitled Lead poisoning and health that,> “Lead is a cumulative toxicant that affects multiple body systems and is> particularly harmful to young children.”Although lead had been known to be toxic ‘since antiquity’, the decision to addit to motor fuel clearly ignored this fact, but the dangers from inhaling leadedfumes soon became apparent, as Dr Needleman explains,> “When tetraethyl lead (TEL) was first produced for use as a motor fuel> additive in 1925, workers at all three operating plants began to die.”These tragedies should certainly have alerted the people in charge of theoperating plants to the fact that there was a serious health hazard associatedwith the inhalation of tetraethyl lead; but these deaths seem to have beenignored and leaded motor fuel remained in use for many decades after 1925.Leaded fuel has been phased out of use since the mid-1970s, but, although mostvehicles now use unleaded fuel, some very old vehicles in certain parts of theworld still use leaded fuel. Furthermore, certain types of aviation fuel alsocontain lead; although it is reported that these leaded fuels will be replacedby unleaded versions in the near future. However, the stability of lead and itspersistence means that the environment remains contaminated from lead emissionsby leaded vehicle fuels over the course of many decades.It is not only the atmosphere that has been contaminated; people who inhaledtoxic exhaust fumes also absorbed a certain level of lead into their bodies.This means that many people also remain contaminated with lead, which takes timeto be eliminated depending on which part of the body absorbed the largest levelof lead. Blood lead levels are said to decrease over a comparatively shortperiod of some months, whereas lead in bone can take years or even decades to beexcreted.The use of lead as an ingredient of paint has also been mostly, although notentirely, discontinued; some industrial paints still contain lead. Although leadis no longer an ingredient of paints used for home decorating, leaded paints hadbeen widely used for decades in a variety of buildings, including homes, officesand industrial premises. Unless and until those layers of leaded paint have beencompletely and carefully removed, the hazards to health remain, even if theleaded paint is hidden beneath many subsequent layers of unleaded paint.There is a phenomenon known as ‘sick building syndrome’ that is poorlyunderstood; however, the presence of leaded paint on the walls and doors etc,could be considered as a potential and very credible contributory factor to thisphenomenon. The symptoms ascribed to this condition include headaches,dizziness, runny nose and itchy watery eyes, all of which can be caused by lowlevel but frequent exposures to lead.The detrimental health effects from lead are numerous, depending on the degreeof exposure; the most disturbing are the effects on the nervous system, some ofwhich are explained by Dr Needleman in more detail,> “Lead poisoning in adults can affect the peripheral and central nervous> systems, the kidneys, and blood pressure. Classical descriptions of> occupational toxicity depict peripheral neuropathy with wrist or foot drop....> Patients with high blood lead levels may present with severe intractable> colic, motor clumsiness, clouded consciousness, weakness and paralysis. Lead> has adverse effects on both male and female reproduction.”Lead poisoning is clearly capable of producing a large number of adverse healtheffects, one of which is paralysis, as described by Nikander more than 2,000years ago. The establishment definition also refers to paralysis as one of thesymptoms that can result from lead poisoning. This would tend to suggest that,in the 20th century, some cases of paralysis caused by lead poisoning may havebeen misdiagnosed and labelled as ‘polio’.Lead is one of the few chemicals specifically mentioned by the Healthyenvironments report; its dangers are also recognised in the WHO fact sheet thatstates,> “There is no known level of lead exposure that is considered safe.”MercuryThe establishment definition of mercury refers to,> “a silvery metallic element that is liquid at room temperature.”Mercury is widely regarded as one of the most toxic naturally-occurringsubstances on Earth. It is rarely found in its pure metallic form in nature, butusually occurs in the form of an ore called mercury sulphide, which is alsoknown as cinnabar.Mercury is an unusual metal because, as the definition states, in its puremetallic form at normal ambient temperatures it is liquid; a quality that gaverise to its alternative name quicksilver. This toxic metal does solidify,although this will only occur at temperatures below -38ºC.It is reported that mercury has been mined for more than two thousand years, andthat it was used by the ancient Greeks in ointments and by the ancient Egyptiansin cosmetics, which tends to suggest that neither of these civilisations knewabout its severe toxicity. It should be clear that a long history of use doesnot ‘prove’ that a substance is safe; this is particularly pertinent withrespect to mercury.The apparent ignorance about mercury’s toxicity continued into the 14th century,when it came into use as a treatment for leprosy, and the 16th century, when itsuse was extended to the treatment of syphilis. The recognition by the medicalestablishment that mercury is highly toxic has been an extremely slow processthat only seems to have begun in the early 20th century; the establishmentdefinition of mercury states the consequences of that realisation,> “Its toxicity has caused a decline in the use of its compounds in medicine> during this century...”Chapter two revealed that mercury continues to be used in the manufacture ofvaccines and, although it is claimed to be ‘filtered out’, this claim has beenshown to be unfounded, because ‘trace amounts’ always remain.Mercury is utilised in the extraction of precious metals, such as gold andsilver, due to its ability to dissolve metals from their ores; this furtherdemonstrates that mining is a particularly hazardous occupation. In Health andNutrition Secrets Dr Russell Blaylock states unequivocally that mercury isneurotoxic and explains how this property affected cinnabar mine workers,> “After years of working in mines, workers would often suffer from crippling> neurological and mental disorders.”Mercury is released into the environment from a number of sources, some of whichmay be natural but others are the direct result of human activities. Theseactivities include: mining and smelting; discharges from coal-fired powerplants; and other industrial processes. Dr Blaylock indicates the scale of therelease of mercury into the atmosphere,> “It has been estimated that as much as 5,000 tons of mercury are released into> the atmosphere every year from burning coal and natural gas and refining> petroleum products.”The dangers posed by exposure to mercury in the atmosphere far exceed thoseallegedly posed by carbon dioxide; yet the scientific community continues topromulgate fear through the mainstream media about ‘climate change’ caused byhuman emissions of carbon dioxide, whilst ignoring the far greater dangers posedby industrial emissions of mercury.Despite the medical establishment denial of the dangers posed by the ‘traceamounts’ of mercury in vaccines, they admit to the existence of adverse healtheffects from small exposures to mercury; as indicated by the March 2017 WHO factsheet entitled Mercury and health, that states,> “Exposure to mercury – even in small amounts – may cause serious health> problems...”The WHO claims that adverse health effects are only caused by methylmercury andthat ethylmercury, the form used in vaccines, does not pose risks to health;this claim is however, unfounded.In addition to the different industries that have discharged mercury into theatmosphere, some industries have discharged mercury into the sea, which hascaused serious health problems for local populations. Dr Blaylock explains thatbetween 1932 and 1968 in Minamata Bay in Japan,> “...the Chisso Factory of Minamata produced and dumped one hundred tons of> mercury into the Minamata Bay in the process of manufacturing acetic acid,> used in making vinyl chloride for floor tiles and artificial leather.”The result of this disaster was that more than 5,000 people suffered frommercury-related neurological health problems and nearly 500 people died. DrBlaylock refers to another incident in which he reports that many thousands ofpeople were severely injured and hundreds of people died as the result ofingesting corn that had been treated with a mercurial fungicide. He states thatpeople are exposed to mercury from a number of sources and that,> “...most human contact with this deadly toxin comes from man-made sources such> as dental amalgams, beauty creams, mirrors, medications, vaccinations,> coal-burning, and other industrial uses.”One of the hazards from dental amalgams is that the mercury in the amalgamconstantly releases vapour, which is inhaled and drawn into the brain; however,as will be discussed later in this chapter, the dental establishment denies thatany health hazards result from dental amalgams. This denial is unacceptableconsidering that the WHO has acknowledged that small amounts of mercury cancause serious health problems.Another form of mercury is a compound called mercury chloride, also known ascalomel. This compound was regarded as a ‘medicine’ and used as a diuretic,laxative and topical disinfectant. David Livingstone, the famous 19th centuryexplorer, was also a medical doctor. He took calomel with him on his trip toAfrica and used it to treat himself when he became very ill with a recurringfever that he believed to be malarial. Unfortunately, his lack of knowledgeabout the serious dangers of mercury means that his use of calomel as a‘medicine’ substantially contributed to his death at a relatively early age.As previously discussed, mercury continued to be used in the treatment ofsyphilis into the early 20th century; it was prescribed and used for both adultsand children. One of the consequences of this ‘treatment’ was an increase inother health problems, as Dr Blaylock states,> “It is interesting to note that one of the most common diagnoses for admission> to mental hospitals during this period was neurosyphilis...”The label ‘neurosyphilis’ indicates that the nervous system has been affected;mercury is a known neurotoxin. This would indicate, therefore, that peopleclaimed to suffer from ‘neurosyphilis’ had been misdiagnosed; their conditionshould have been labelled ‘mercury poisoning’ and they should not have beenadmitted to mental hospitals.Mercury poisoning is clearly another instance of ‘iatrogenesis’, although thenumber of people who have died as the result of its use as a medicine over thecourse of many centuries is unknown, because it was not recognised to bedangerous until relatively recently. Dr Blaylock refers to the use of mercuryfor the treatment of syphilis as,> “...one of the greatest medical disasters of all times...”This is an understatement; the treatment of any condition with mercury is one ofthe most tragic errors of ‘medical science’. It is an error because there is nobasis for the belief that mercury has any beneficial effect within the humanbody, as Herbert Shelton explains in his January 1972 article entitled How Faris Too Far?> “Mercury is not a constituent of any of the fluids and tissues of the body and> is not usable in the performance of any of the body’s functions. It is equally> as unusable in a state of illness as in health.”Some of mercury’s neurotoxic effects include disruption to the normalfunctioning of the nervous system; it can also impair other functions, such ascognitive skills, and has the ability to cause tremors and sleep disturbance.Mercury can also damage brain functioning, which means that it has the abilityto cause a variety of health problems that have been given a number of otherlabels, including that of autism. As will be discussed in chapter seven,‘autism’ is neither a single condition nor does it have a single cause, which isconvenient for the vested interests that seek to deny a causal connectionbetween vaccines that contain a form of mercury and subsequent brain damage.Mercury is not the only neurotoxic substance used in vaccines; there are others,including aluminium as already discussed.Another frequently occurring theme in discussions about the toxicity ofdifferent substances, is the distinction between large doses or exposures thathave distinct effects and low-level doses or exposures, the effects of which arefar more difficult to measure. The particular problems with the differenteffects from exposure to mercury are described by Dr Blaylock,> “Acute poisoning with massive doses of mercury is clinically obvious, with> such symptoms as abdominal cramping, kidney failure, hallucinations, muscular> weakness, and numbness in the hands and feet.”He contrasts these symptoms with the effects from a lower level of exposure tomercury,> “Lower mercury levels frequently cause unusual irritability, timidity and> suicidal tendencies.”These effects could easily be misdiagnosed as a ‘mental illness’ and treatedwith toxic psychiatric drugs. Dr Blaylock also describes the effects from evensmaller exposures,> “Even lower levels may produce symptoms that most physicians would not even> connect to mercury.”It is extremely likely that those physicians who would not recognise the effectsof low-level mercury poisoning, may suggest that a patient’s illness is due toan ‘infection’, because, as Dr Blaylock explains, the kinds of symptomsexperienced would include frequent colds, joint pains, subtle neurologicaldysfunction, headaches and poor memory; all of these symptoms may be attributedto a ‘virus’.Like lead, there is no ‘safe’ level of exposure to mercury; as demonstrated bythe statement in the 2010 article entitled Mercury Exposure and Children’sHealth, which was previously cited in chapter two but deserves repetition,> “Mercury is a highly toxic element; there is no known safe level of exposure.”It is clear that mercury is finally being recognised as the highly toxic andextremely dangerous substance that it is; unfortunately, recognition of thisfact has been an exceedingly slow process and has cost untold numbers of peopleand children their health and even their lives.ArsenicThe establishment definition of arsenic refers to,> “...a poisonous greyish metallic element...”Arsenic occurs naturally in conjunction with a number of other metals, such asgold, copper, zinc and lead; it is therefore a common by-product of mining andof smelting processes used to extract these other metals. Furthermore, like leadand mercury, arsenic is a persistent pollutant.As indicated by the definition, arsenic is recognised as poisonous; a propertythat made it useful for a number of applications, particularly insecticides;some reports indicate that arsenic-based insecticides were first used in Chinain the 10th century. According to an article entitled The Global Problem of LeadArsenate Pesticides on the website of the LEAD Group,> “Arsenical insecticides have been used in agriculture for centuries.”Arsenic is also used in rodenticides and remains an ingredient of many 21stcentury rat poisons.Arsenic is also carcinogenic; it has been classified by the IARC as a class 1human carcinogen, which makes it a plausible causal factor, or certainly asignificant contributory factor, for many of the earliest reported cases ofcancer; a point that has also been expressed by Rachel Carson in Silent Spring,> “The association between arsenic and cancer in man and animals is historic.”Arsenic is another of the chemicals specifically referred to as toxic by the WHOin the Healthy environments report. As discussed in chapter four, arsenic was amain ingredient of insecticidal sheep dips, which, although intended to onlykill the insect pest, was shown to have also had a detrimental impact on thehealth of sheep and sheep farmers, as well as anyone who handled sheep dip orworked with fleeces treated with the toxic dip.In his book entitled The Arsenic Century, James C Whorton PhD pays particularattention to the situation in 19th century Britain, where arsenic becameubiquitous,> “Arsenic lurked at every turn in the Victorian world...”During this period, there was a substantial increase in mining throughout manyparts of Britain. As mentioned above, arsenic is a common by-product of miningand smelting processes, which therefore generated an abundant supply of arsenic.Its abundance made arsenic readily available and cheap, all of which encouragedits use for a variety of applications; a situation that resulted in many sourcesof exposures for the population of Britain, as explained by Dr Whorton,> “...people took it in with fruits and vegetables, swallowed it with wine,> inhaled it from cigarettes, absorbed it from cosmetics and imbibed it even> from the pint glass.”Anyone who is familiar with the works of Charles Dickens will be aware that, in19th century Britain, the diet of the poor consisted mainly of bread and beer,both of which could be contaminated with arsenic. The reason that bread wascontaminated, was that some farmers used an arsenic-based insecticide solutionto soak their wheat seeds to prevent infestations with various ‘pests’. Themajority of people, especially the poor, were also exposed to arsenic releasedfrom the coal in their fires.In common with other persistent toxins, the serious adverse health effects ofarsenic are often the result of cumulative exposures, as acknowledged by theFebruary 2018 WHO fact sheet entitled Arsenic that states,> “Long-term exposure to arsenic from drinking-water and food can cause cancer> and skin lesions. It has also been associated with cardiovascular disease and> diabetes.”It is therefore unsurprising that people in 19th century Britain sufferedill-health, some of which can be ascribed to arsenic poisoning. However, theydid not fare a great deal better if they could afford the services of aphysician, because, as discussed, arsenic was an ingredient of many ‘medicines’of the period. In another similarity with mercury, knowledge of arsenic’stoxicity did not preclude its use in ‘treatments’ for a variety of conditions;compounds based on arsenic had been prescribed for many centuries, dating backto the time of Hippocrates.Some of the conditions for which arsenic was used as a treatment during the 19thcentury include rheumatism, worms and morning sickness. Prescribing a poison asa ‘cure’ for morning sickness demonstrates an abysmally low level of knowledgeabout health, or the potential for serious harm to a developing baby from apoison ingested by the expectant mother. The treatment of morning sickness witharsenic-based ‘medicines’ is likely to have been a significant contributoryfactor for infant mortality and maternal death in childbirth, both of whichexisted at high levels at that period of time.Arsenic was also promoted as a ‘cure’ for asthma. It is reported that CharlesDarwin used an arsenic-based treatment for his eczema, a condition that oftenappears in conjunction with asthma; however, neither asthma nor eczema can becured by arsenic, except permanently when the patient dies as the result ofarsenic poisoning.Ingestion of arsenic can produce a rather violent reaction, which often includesvomiting; it is this strong reaction that was believed to demonstrate theallegedly ‘therapeutic’ nature of this poison. During the 19th century, it wasbelieved by many physicians that a person became ill due to an imbalance intheir body; an idea that dates back to the time of Hippocrates. The reason forusing arsenic to redress an ‘imbalance’ was that it would ‘shock’ the body backinto balance and therefore back to health.A dose of a poisonous substance that was large enough to cause a violentreaction could also result in death; it is not surprising therefore, that thiskind of treatment was often referred to as ‘heroic medicine’. Presumably onlystrong ‘heroes’ were able to survive being poisoned in the name of healthcare.Dr Whorton also refers to the extensive use of arsenic-based treatments andstates,> “...arsenic was also a component of an array of medicines, being frequently> prescribed by physicians and almost as liberally purveyed by quacks.”It is interesting to note that ‘physicians’ seemed to be more liberal inprescribing arsenic-based ‘medicines’ for their patients than ‘quacks’. However,as demonstrated throughout this book, the human body cannot be poisoned back tohealth.One arsenic-based ‘medicine’ is the substance called arsphenamine, which is alsoknown as Salvarsan and as compound 606. Salvarsan is significant for a fewreasons, one of which is that it replaced mercury ointments in the treatment ofsyphilis. Another is that Salvarsan is considered to have been the first‘effective’ treatment for syphilis, which suggests that, despite its use overthe course of a number of centuries, mercury had not been as effective as it isoften claimed to have been.The third reason that Salvarsan is significant is because this ‘medicine’ isregarded as heralding the beginning of the era of ‘chemotherapeutic’ drugs. Theuse of arsenic as ‘medicine’ must be regarded as yet another of the tragicerrors of ‘medical science’.Patients were not the only victims of arsenic poisoning; medical students andthe physicians who taught medicine during the 19th century also suffered, buttheir exposures were due to a specific aspect of medical training, which is thestudy of anatomy, as Dr Whorton explains,> “Not even professors of medicine were secure from the poison, the cadavers> they and their pupils dissected in anatomical studies being oft-times> preserved from decomposition with arsenic.”The ability of arsenic to ‘preserve’ specimens led to its introduction and useas an embalming fluid, although it was largely replaced by formaldehyde, whichwas discovered in the late 19th century; formaldehyde did not however, entirelyreplace arsenic as the embalming fluid of choice until the early 20th century.The main problem arising from the use of arsenic in applications such asmedicines, pesticides and embalming fluid, is due to its persistence in theenvironment; which means that, long after this toxin has ceased to be used, itcontinues to pose serious hazards to health.The seriousness of the problem caused by the widespread use of arsenic duringthe 19th century, led John Gay to write an article in 1859 for the Medical Timesand Gazette; this article, which is quoted by Dr Whorton in his book, includesthe question,> “How long will money-hunters be allowed, in the pursuit of their game, to> vitiate the necessaries of life with the deadliest poisons?”This plea remains pertinent more than a century and a half later; it has yet tobe fully recognised as applicable to all toxic substances and acted upon!UraniumIn common with the three previous elements, uranium is a naturally-occurringtoxic substance; however, unlike lead, mercury and arsenic, uranium isradioactive. Ionising radiation, the type emitted by radioactive substances suchas uranium, is discussed in more detail later in this chapter.Interestingly, there is no establishment definition of uranium, nor has the WHOproduced a fact sheet on the topic. Fortunately, the IPPNW (InternationalPhysicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War) has produced a fact sheet entitledHealth Effects of Uranium Mining, which states that,> “Uranium is highly toxic and attacks the inner organs...”Uranium is found in nature within an ore, which is also known as pitchblende.This ore is, however, more dangerous than elemental uranium, because it alsocontains various uranium decay by-products, or daughter isotopes as they arealso called, many of which are more radioactive than pure uranium.There are a number of isotopes of the naturally-occurring form of uranium andthese range from U-233 to U-238, each of which has a different half-life thatranges from 69 years for U-233 to four and a half billion years for U-238. Aswell as being the most persistent, U-238 is also the most abundant uraniumisotope found in nature.Uranium decays by emitting alpha and beta particles, a process that results inthe production of a long series of decay by-products and ultimately ends in theformation of the stable element lead. One of the decay by-products of uranium isradium, the highly radioactive and dangerous substance that was discovered byMarie Curie. Unfortunately, she was unaware of its dangers and failed to protectherself; a situation that contributed to the development of her cancer and toher early death. Radium also has many radioactive isotopes, the most stable oneof which is radium-226 that has a half-life of approximately 1600 years.Radium decays to radon gas, which has a very short half-life of approximately 4days. Radon gas is, however, highly radioactive, dangerous and a recognisedcarcinogen; it is also invisible and undetectable by taste or smell. Radon gasis known to be released in areas rich in uranium deposits and a contributoryfactor for cancers in areas where uranium has been mined.It is highly likely therefore, that exposures to uranium, radium and radon gaswould have been significant contributory factors to cancers in the ancient past.Uranium was discovered in 1789 and first mined in the US in 1871, although itsradioactivity was not discovered until 1896 from the work of Henri Becquerel,after whom one of the units for measuring radioactivity was named.It is clear that uranium miners would have been subjected to high levels ofexposure to this dangerous substance. Unfortunately for miners, protectivemeasures were not implemented until long after the discovery of the hazardsassociated with uranium mining, as Dr Rosalie Bertell PhD explains in her bookentitled No Immediate Danger,> “The danger of uranium mining had been known for a hundred years before 1945,> yet it took until 1967, with many unnecessary miner deaths from lung cancer,> to legislate regulations for mine ventilation and subsequent reduction of> airborne radioactive particles and gas in the mines.”Dr Bertell also explains that commercial mining for uranium began in the US in1949; this increased activity was mainly stimulated by demands from theManhattan Project for increased volumes of the raw materials necessary to assisttheir continuing development of nuclear weapons.Whilst other factors, especially smoking, are known to contribute to anincreased risk of developing lung cancer, uranium miners were shown toexperience a greatly enhanced risk, as Dr Ernest Sternglass PhD describes in hisbook entitled Secret Fallout,> “...it has long been known that uranium miners have ten times the normal rate> of lung cancers because of their breathing of radioactive gas in the mines.”Earth Works is a non-profit organisation concerned with a number ofenvironmental problems, including the dangers from uranium mining; a 2011 reportentitled Nuclear Power’s Other Tragedy, available from the website, states that,> “Mining not only exposes uranium to the atmosphere, where it becomes reactive,> but releases other radioactive elements such as thorium and radium and toxic> heavy metals including arsenic, selenium, mercury and cadmium.”These radioactive elements and toxic heavy metals clearly increase the level ofenvironmental contamination in the vicinity of the mines. The IPPNW fact sheetalso refers to the serious hazards associated with uranium mining,> “Lung cancer, leukemia, stomach cancer and birth defects are the diseases most> often to be found as a result of uranium mining.”On the CDC website is a page that refers to an ongoing series of studies of thehealth of uranium miners. Although called a ‘worker health study’, it is aninvestigation of the mortality of uranium miners who worked underground todetermine if their mortality exceeded the ‘normal’ level in the generalpopulation from various diseases. The study was begun in 1950 due to,> “...concerns that uranium mining causes cancer.”It is reported within the results of the study that, unsurprisingly, uraniumminers experienced far greater mortality than the general population from thesediseases. The studies finally resulted in legislation in 1990 when the RadiationExposure Compensation Act was passed.Unfortunately, the hazards due to uranium mining remain long after theextraction processes have ceased and the mines have become inactive. A factsheet available from the website of the organisation, Clean Up The Mines(cleanupthemines.org), provides information about the hazards of uranium mining,and exposes the existence of many thousands of abandoned uranium mines (AUMs) inthe US, as well as the dangers they pose,> “AUMs remain dangerously radioactive for hundreds of thousands of years.”It is clear that decisions taken for short term goals without due regard for thelong-term consequences have generated serious health hazards, particularly whenthey involve substances that are known to be toxic and highly dangerous.Manufactured Poisons & ApplicationsThe preceding discussions have shown that human activities during the last fewmillennia have been responsible for the discharge of various materials into theenvironment. Although toxic and persistent, these materials have all been‘natural’.More recently, the quality of the environment has undergone significant anddramatic changes that began during the era of scientific advancement in the 16thand 17th centuries and continued with the era of industrialisation in the 18thand 19th centuries.It must be emphasised that environmental pollution is not caused by‘industrialisation’ per se; it is caused by the nature of the materials used andproduced by industry. The vast majority of these materials are entirely man-madeand inherently toxic. It is for this reason that most environmental pollutioncan be directly attributed to ‘manufactured poisons’ and the applications inwhich they have been employed.It is often claimed that the changes brought about by the combination of scienceand industry represent advances in ‘civilisation’, and that these innovationshave generated improved standards of living. This claim is unfounded; the majorbeneficiaries of industrialisation have been industrialists, many of whom becameextremely wealthy. The ‘ordinary people’, by comparison, were not so fortunate;large numbers of them merely exchanged a life of poverty and deprivation fromsubsistence farming in rural areas, to poverty and deprivation from factoryemployment in urban areas. The changed living and working conditions theyendured cannot be described as representing an improvement to their livingstandards.Previous chapters have described some of the appalling living conditions thathad existed over the course of many centuries in various European countries,some of which became centres of ‘industrialisation’. The working conditions,especially in factories, were no better. People were made to work long hours,adults were usually expected to work for a minimum of 12 and even up to 16 hoursper day for 6 days per week; children would also work in the factories becausethey were a cheap source of labour. The conditions in the factories wereappalling and often dangerous; as well as the hazards they faced from themachines they operated, people were also exposed to a variety of hazardous andinvariably toxic substances.Industrialisation together with science and technology are promoted as necessaryfor ‘development’ that leads to better standards of living for the wholepopulation; it is also claimed to lead to better health for everyone, but thisis not borne out by the evidence that shows the incidence of chronic diseases in‘developed’ countries to be continuing to increase, not decrease. Chronicdiseases, also known as NCDs, are often referred to as ‘diseases of affluence’,but this term is an oxymoron. Affluence is usually associated with betterhealth, but clearly is not the case. A number of the most significant NCDs arediscussed in chapter seven.However, the discussions in chapters seven, eight and ten will demonstrate that‘disease’ is entirely unrelated to income, whether of an individual or theentire country, but instead, is related to the condition of the environment inwhich people live, which in turn is related to the ‘manufactured poisons’ towhich they are exposed.The era of scientific advancement entailed significant developments in the fieldof chemistry during the 18th century; these included discoveries of many newchemical elements, all of which are ‘natural’ even though some of them never, oronly very rarely, occur naturally in their elemental form. Some of the chemistswere also industrialists; a situation that presented a clear incentive for themto undertake research to investigate the properties of these newly discoveredchemicals and their potential usefulness for industrial applications.The complete absence of knowledge about the nature of the newly-discoveredchemical elements used in these experiments, meant that chemists were unawarethat their work exposed them to potential dangers. The result was that chemistswere often the first to succumb to the dangerous nature of the toxic chemicalswith which they worked; many of them suffered serious ill-health and some wouldbe precipitated to an early death, as was the case with Marie Curie.Nevertheless, pioneering chemists continued to develop chemical compounds thatwould be introduced into industrial practices to replace existing raw materials,some of which had been made from ‘natural’ substances; chemical dyes, forexample, were introduced to replace plant-based dyes.The main reason for using manufactured chemical compounds in preference tonatural materials was that the former could be produced more cheaply and ingreater quantities than the latter. Also, chemicals can be repeatedlymanufactured to exactly the same chemical formula; which means they willtherefore be consistent in their composition and quality. These are propertiesthat natural materials rarely possess; plants, for example, will be affected byvariations in weather patterns and the quality of the soil in which they aregrown.Industrialists, like all business owners, need to make a profit from theirenterprise in order to earn a ‘return’ from their investment. Raw materialinputs that were cheap, available in large quantities and of a consistentcomposition and quality were clearly of immense economic benefit to them. Butconcentrating solely on economic benefits was a short-sighted view, as itengendered a lack of consideration for the possibility of adverse consequencesand therefore failed to encourage the implementation of robust safety testingprocedures.Another development that was to have a profound impact on industry was thediscovery of oil, or ‘black gold’ as it is also known. It is reported that oilwas first drilled in China in the 4th century, however there are also reportsthat various indigenous peoples around the world had, over the course ofcenturies or even millennia, collected oil from ‘seeps’; it has not always beennecessary to dig wells to extract oil.There are debates about the location of the first oil well, but there is nodispute about the fact that the discovery and extraction of oil in the US in themid-19th century was the beginning of the oil ‘boom’ that gave rise to the birthof the oil industry.The growth of the oil industry during the past century and a half has beenphenomenally rapid; this industry has become one of the largest in the world.However, its activities are not limited to the extraction and refining of oil;they include the creation of chemicals derived from crude oil. These are knownas petrochemicals; they perform such a wide variety of functions withinindustrial processes that they have become essential for virtually allindustries.In Making Peace With the Planet Dr Barry Commoner refers to the petrochemicalindustry as ‘unique’ and adds the comment that,> “The petrochemical industry is inherently inimical to environmental quality.”Dr Commoner was critical of this industry because, as he explains,> “Not only are its wastes dangerous but its very products degrade the> environment much more than the ones they displace.”However, it was not just the petrochemical industry that inspired Dr Commoner’scriticism; he held a similar view of all types of industrial production,> “Environmental degradation is built into the technical design of the modern> instruments of production.”Although significant, petrochemicals form only part of the output of thechemical industry that is now so vast that it is regarded as a vital aspect ofthe world economy. The products of this enormous industry are truly ubiquitous;chemicals form the main ingredients of virtually all 21st century products, buttheir effects are far from benign, as this chapter will demonstrate.Chemicals are not the only environmental pollutants; although it is a much morerecent phenomenon, technology is another significant contributor to the problem.The transmission of radio waves was first demonstrated at the end of the 19thcentury; this innovation led to the development of radar (radio detection andranging) in the 1930s. The first ‘computer’ was developed in the 1940s; this wasfollowed by the invention of the integrated circuit in the 1950s and by the useof silicon as the material for the circuit ‘chip’. These inventions andinnovations, together with others that have been developed in subsequent years,have facilitated the rise of the technology industry that has continued to growat an ever-faster pace.The expansion of the IT (Information Technology) industry has generated hugevolumes and varieties of products in the fields of computing, telecommunicationsand electronics, to name just a few. These technologies have been attended bymany benefits, but they are also accompanied by many hazards, one of whichrelates to the materials with which the various devices and equipment aremanufactured; these materials include plastics and rare earth elements. Plasticsare discussed later in this chapter.Rare earth elements are ‘natural’ chemical elements that display certainproperties deemed useful for various technologies; some of these elements haveproperties that assist miniaturisation, others have properties that produceincreased speed and improved performance. Although referred to as ‘rare’ many ofthese chemical elements are abundant, but they are difficult, and thereforeexpensive, to extract in significant quantities.Another hazard associated with technology is electromagnetic radiation (EMR).Although this form of radiation, referred to as non-ionising, is less harmfulthan ionising radiation, it is not harmless, as the discussion later in thischapter will demonstrate.Technology and the communication systems that accompany them are, likechemicals, not fully tested for all possible effects prior to their introductiononto the market and into the environment. They are invariably promoted as‘safe’; which means that the onus is placed on scientists, usuallyepidemiologists, to prove otherwise. But this is virtually impossible, becauseas soon as the hazard is released into the environment, ‘science’ is unable todetect or analyse the effects of a single substance or influence in the midst ofa myriad of other substances and influences.The problem of environmental pollution originates with the manufacture of a widevariety of products that utilise hazardous materials and the release of theseproducts into the environment with little or no concern for their impact in theenvironment.Although there are increasing efforts to take remedial action for environmentalpollution, most of them are woefully inadequate to fully address the problem. Inorder for these efforts to be truly effective, ‘science’ must dispense with anumber of erroneous theories that contribute to the problem rather than help tosolve it. The most important theories to be discarded are the ‘germ theory’ andthe theory that it is the dose that makes the poison. Another idea that must beabandoned is that climate change is a greater problem than environmentalpollution.It is of vital importance that the real threat to humanity is recognised to beenvironmental pollution caused by the manufacture and use of toxic chemicals andhazardous technologies. These are the factors that have been proven to beassociated with adverse health effects, as the following discussions willdemonstrate.ChemicalsThe immense scale of the operations of the chemical industry and their attendanthazards were recognised by Dr Barry Commoner in the 1992 edition of Making PeaceWith The Planet, in which he wrote that,> “In manufacturing its annual 500 to 600 billion pounds of products, the> chemical industry is also responsible for emitting into the environment nearly> the same amount of toxic chemicals.”Unlike the WHO, Dr Commoner recognised the full extent of environmentaldegradation due to chemicals,> “The chemical industry, its emissions of toxic substances largely> unrestrained, has become the major threat to environmental quality.”Not only are the industry’s toxic emissions largely unrestrained, but themajority of the chemicals they have produced have not undergone tests todetermine their toxicity, as indicated by Dr Devra Davis PhD in her bookentitled The Secret History of the War on Cancer, in which she refers to thesituation at the end of the 20th century,> “In 1983 and again in 1998, the National Academy of Science confirmed that we> have no public record of the toxicity of 3 out of every 4 of the top 3,000> chemicals in use today.”This situation still applies in the early 21st century; the toxicity of the vastmajority of chemicals in current use is still unknown, because they remainuntested.The exact scale of the problem is unknown; there is no publicly availableinformation that provides a definitive list of all chemicals currently in use. AFebruary 2017 article on the website of the ACS (American Chemical Society) asksthe pertinent question in its title; How many chemicals are in use today? Thearticle indicates that it is not merely the public that has no access to thisinformation but that,> “No one, not even the Environmental Protection Agency, knows how many> chemicals are in use today.”The article does attempt to provide useful information in the statement that,> “EPA has more than 85,000 chemicals listed on its inventory of substances that> fall under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA).”It is claimed that this figure of 85,000 does not represent the total number ofchemicals in current use because it includes many chemicals that have beenremoved from the market; which implies that the total number is rather less thanthis figure. However, the TSCA inventory does not include all chemical compoundsbecause, according to the EPA page entitled TSCA Chemical Substance Inventory,> “The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Chemical Substance Inventory contains> all existing chemical substances manufactured, processed or imported in the> United States that do not qualify for an exemption or exclusion under TSCA.”One group of chemical substances excluded under TSCA are pesticides, which areregulated under FIFRA (Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act), butthe EPA web pages do not indicate the actual number of substances regulatedunder FIFRA.There are many different departments that operate within the EPA and each ofthem has specific functions; the OPP (Office of Pesticide Programs) is thedepartment that implements certain aspects of FIFRA, as indicated by the EPA webpage entitled About the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention(OCSPP) which states, under the sub-heading Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP),that,> “OPP regulates the manufacture and use of all pesticides (including> insecticides, herbicides, rodenticides, disinfectants, sanitizers and more) in> the United States and establishes maximum levels for pesticide residues in> food, thereby safeguarding the nation’s food supply.”Although EPA is a US government department, their policies are not limited toimplementation within America; the EPA has influence in many countries aroundthe world through their ‘bilateral cooperative programmes’. On the EPA web pageentitled Where EPA Works Around the World, is the statement that,> “These programs allow other countries – especially developing countries and> countries with economies in transition – to benefit from US experience in> developing appropriate and effective environmental programs.”The problems experienced by ‘developing countries’ are discussed in furtherdetail in chapter eight, as are the UN policies designed to solve thoseproblems; the undue influence of US vested interests over various UN andinternational programmes and policies is discussed in chapter nine.Another department within the EPA is the OCSPP (Office of Chemical Safety andPollution Prevention); its mission, as stated on the EPA website, is to protectpeople and the environment,> “...from potential risks from pesticides and toxic chemicals.”The OCSPP also implements certain aspects of FIFRA as well as FFDCA (FederalFood Drug and Cosmetics Act), section 408 of which,> “...authorizes EPA to set tolerances, or maximum residue limits for pesticide> residues on foods.”The idea that a level of pesticide residue can be regarded as acceptable,clearly relies heavily on the Paracelsus fallacy that a substance is only toxicif the ‘dose’ exceeds a certain level. The setting of a ‘tolerance’ levelinvariably entails laboratory-based animal research experiments that test theeffects of individual substances. Previous discussions have demonstrated thatthese ideas and tests are seriously flawed; they are incapable of providingresults that are meaningful to the situation in the real world, as Rachel Carsoneloquently articulates in Silent Spring,> “The whole problem of pesticide poisoning is enormously complicated by the> fact that a human being, unlike a laboratory animal living under rigidly> controlled conditions, is never exposed to one chemical alone.”This point is further emphasised by a 2004 article entitled Synergy: The BigUnknowns of Pesticide Exposure on the website of Beyond Pesticides that states,> “Synergistic effects between multiple pesticides and/or other chemicals> represent one of the greatest gaps in EPA’s ability to protect the public from> the adverse health effects associated with pesticide use and exposure.”The existence of synergistic effects means that the EPA’s claim that they can‘safeguard’ the food supply by setting maximum residue limits for individualpesticides is unfounded.It is clear that the use of toxic natural substances has a long history thatpreceded the birth of the chemical industry by many centuries if not millennia.However, non-toxic materials also have a long history of use for variousprocesses prior to the Industrial Revolution; textile dyes for example wereoften sourced from plants.One of the chemical discoveries of the 18th century was chlorine, which wasfirst extracted from hydrochloric acid in 1774. Further experiments withchlorine resulted in the discovery that it could bleach textiles far morerapidly than existing methods; a discovery that led to the development ofchlorine-based powders for use within the textile industry.The expansion of coal mining led to investigations of the properties of coal andits by-products. These experiments led to the development of coal-tar basedcompounds, some of which were found to produce certain colours and thereforebecame useful for textile dyes. The dye industry, as discussed later in thischapter, has become a huge multibillion-dollar industry that manufacturessynthetic chemical ‘colourings’ that have many industrial applications, inaddition to textile dyes.The development of the oil industry led to the development of compounds derivedfrom petrochemicals, which were also found to be useful for a variety ofindustrial processes.There are, however, many health hazards associated with compounds made fromchlorine, coal tar and petroleum. The hazards associated with coal tar-baseddyes, for example, were discovered in the late 19th century, as David Michaelsexplains in his book entitled Doubt is Their Product,> “The German dye industry discovered that aromatic amines caused human bladder> cancer in 1895.”During the 19th century, electrolysis was increasingly used as a method ofreleasing chemical elements from the compounds in which they naturally occur;the electrolysis of brine was discovered to produce chlorine gas. The expansionof the textile industry created an increased demand for chlorine, the basicingredient of bleaching powders; this naturally encouraged a substantialincrease in the extraction of chlorine using the process of electrolysis.In its elemental form, chlorine is a highly reactive gas, but it does not occurin nature in this elemental form. In nature, chlorine is always found incompounds, the best-known of which is sodium chloride, or salt. In this form, itis stable, but when chlorine gas is released from this, or any other compoundits nature changes dramatically, as Joe Thornton explains in Pandora’s Poison,> “...chlorine gas is highly reactive, combining quickly and randomly with> whatever organic matter it encounters...”The highly reactive nature of chlorine means that it readily replaces hydrogenatoms in organic compounds; the new compounds formed by this process arereferred to as chlorinated hydrocarbons, or organochlorines, which, are stablebut persistent; persistence is one of the major hazards associated with them.The human body is composed of organic matter; it is for this reason thatexposure to chlorine gas is so hazardous for humans. The discussion about ‘1918Flu’ in chapter four referred to the health damage caused by the deployment ofchlorine gas as a chemical weapon on the battlefields during WWI. Joe Thorntonaptly refers to chlorine in its elemental form as ‘Pandora’s Poison’ because, ashe explains,> “We lose control of chlorine the second it is produced....”Chlorine is a pertinent example of a pollutant about which Dr Commoner states,> “...once it is produced, it is too late.”Unfortunately, despite its inherently harmful nature, chlorine has becomeubiquitous; it is an ingredient of a significant proportion of chemicalcompounds used in a wide variety of everyday products.It is widely recognised that many thousands of chemicals have never been testedfor their safety, or their health effects. However, many of the chemicals thathave been tested and shown to induce adverse health effects nevertheless remainin use. Chlorine is a particularly appropriate example; one of its main uses isin the treatment of water in order to kill ‘germs’, as will be discussed laterin this chapter. Joe Thornton explains the adverse health effects associatedwith exposure to organochlorines,> “Several hundred compounds have now been tested, and virtually all> organochlorines examined to date cause one or more of a wide variety of> adverse effects on essential biological processes, including development,> reproduction, brain function and immunity.”The TSCA was originally passed in 1976 in order to regulate chemicals; as thetitle of the act suggests, it was intended to control ‘toxic substances’; but ithas clearly failed to do so. The Act has since been amended; the June 2016amended legislation effectively requires the EPA to clear their ‘backlog’ andtest all remaining untested chemicals that have nevertheless been approved foruse.However, even if the EPA conducted all the required tests, this would still failto ensure the integrity of the environment or to safeguard public health,because the testing procedures are inadequate. The reason they are inadequate isbecause they are based on flawed theories, including the theory related to ‘riskassessment’.Peter Montague’s hope that the days of inadequate ‘risk assessment’ were waningunfortunately has yet to be fulfilled. This flawed method remains firmlyentrenched within chemical safety testing procedures, as demonstrated by theIPCS (International Programme on Chemical Safety), a WHO programme, thefunctions of which are explained on the WHO web page entitled Methods forchemicals assessment,> “IPCS work in the field of methodology aims to promote the development,> harmonization and use of generally acceptable, scientifically sound> methodologies for the evaluation of risks to human health from exposure to> chemicals.”There are many problems with this approach, not least of which is the idea thatany level of ‘risk’ to human health from exposure to chemicals should be deemedacceptable. In his article entitled Making Good Decisions, Peter Montague refersto risk assessment as ‘inherently misleading’ and states that,> “Risk assessment pretends to determine ‘safe’ levels of exposure to poisons,> but in fact it cannot do any such thing.”He expands on this point in his previously cited 1999 article about riskassessment, in which he states that,> “Science, as a way of knowing, has strict limits...”He elaborates on this point and further states that,> “...risk assessment is not a science, it is an art, combining data gathered by> scientific methods with a large dose of judgement.”One of the main tenets of ‘science’ is that results should be reproducible, butjudgement is clearly not reproducible; a situation that raises serious questionsabout the ‘scientifically sound methodologies’ that the IPCS claims to use toevaluate ‘risks’ to human health.Existing regulatory systems, as discussed further in chapter nine, increasinglyfavour industry over the consumer; they allow the swift release of products ontothe market but involve many difficulties for the removal of products after thediscovery of any adverse effects. This situation is described by Dr Devra Davisin The Secret History of the War on Cancer,> “It can take 3 weeks to approve a new chemical and 30 years to remove an old> one.”There are many examples to illustrate this situation; a pertinent one is DDT, anorganochlorine that was first introduced onto the market in 1938 when it washailed as a ‘miracle’ pesticide. As well as being sprayed on crops, it was alsosprayed on people of all ages to destroy any insect ‘pests’ they may have beencarrying.It must be noted that the DDT used for spraying people was in the form of apowder that was claimed to be less easily absorbed into the skin and thereforeless hazardous; but this does not mean it was ‘safe’. The DDT used for sprayingcrops was an oil-based product that was said to be more easily absorbed, whichmade it more hazardous. Although people were sprayed with DDT powder many werealso exposed to the oil-based DDT used for crop-spraying, as Joe Thorntonexplains,> “Once oil-soluble organochlorines are released into the environment, however,> they accumulate in the fatty tissues of living things, a process called> bioaccumulation.”The PR campaign that promoted DDT as ‘good for you’ ensured that the publicremained completely oblivious of its dangers. But some scientists, especiallythose studying the natural world, began to notice a serious level of decline incertain animal populations, especially birds. One bird species in particularthat experienced a dramatic decline in numbers was the bald eagle, the iconicsymbol of the US. Concerns about these changes were raised mainly, but notsolely, by Rachel Carson and recorded in Silent Spring, in which shedemonstrated clear links between the introduction of heavy pesticide sprayingand a number of adverse conditions observed in many wildlife species.Nevertheless, it was almost a decade after the publication of the book that DDTwas finally banned, although it was only banned in certain countries. The delayand the failure to implement a worldwide ban provides just another example ofthe power of industry to obstruct efforts to remove a lucrative product, despitethe fact that it has been proven to be an environmental hazard.Unfortunately, the proverbial genie had already been let out of the bottle. Incommon with most other organochlorines, DDT is persistent and had been steadilyreleased into the environment over the course of a period of more than 30 yearsprior to the ban. Of particular concern is that DDT is being re-introduced tohelp ‘fight’ a war against mosquitoes in many of the countries where malaria issaid to be endemic; a subject of great importance that is discussed in detail inchapter eight.Certain processes that involve organochlorines generate toxic by-products, whichinclude the group of chemicals called dioxins; these are regarded as some of themost toxic and dangerous substances known to science. The dangers of dioxins arerecognised by the WHO in their October 2016 fact sheet entitled Dioxins andtheir effects on human health that states,> “They belong to the so-called ‘dirty dozen’ – a group of dangerous chemicals> known as persistent organic pollutants (POPs).”Dioxins are a family of chemicals with similar structures and properties; themost toxic member of this family is TCDD (2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin).There are a number of processes that generate dioxins as by-products, one ofwhich is the incineration of chlorine-based chemicals in the presence ofhydrocarbons, such as the burning of chlorine-bleached paper, for example. Themanufacture of chlorine-based chemicals, including pesticides such as DDT, alsogenerates dioxins as by-products.There are many adverse health effects associated with exposure to dioxins; theycan adversely affect the endocrine system, the reproductive system and thecardiovascular system. The endocrine system is particularly sensitive toexposures to minute quantities of toxic substances; Joe Thornton explains,> “The emerging understanding of endocrine mechanisms in molecular biology and> toxicology supports the idea that exposure to tiny quantities of foreign> compounds can disrupt vital biological processes, often without a threshold.”The idea that there can be a ‘safe’ dose of any toxic substance is clearly nolonger tenable.One of the main functions of the endocrine system is to regulate the productionand release of hormones; this function can be disrupted by exposure to a widevariety of chemicals, including organochlorines, as Joe Thornton explains,> “Hormones generally circulate in the blood in the parts per trillion range;> many hormonally active organochlorines are present in significantly higher> quantities.”This means that organochlorines and all other hormonally-active chemicals havethe ability to significantly overpower the body’s ability to control andregulate hormones. This is a matter of particular concern for pregnant women,because disruptions to the hormone system can have devastating consequences forunborn babies.Researchers usually conduct tests using high doses or exposures in order todetermine if the chemical produces certain effects and to ascertain the level atwhich the effect becomes ‘observed’. The dose or exposure is reduced until itreaches the NOAEL (no observed adverse effect level). A ‘safety margin’ is thenapplied to this level to reduce it by a large factor and reach a level that isassumed to be ‘safe’ on the basis that it is too low to produce any adverseeffect. Increasing knowledge about the endocrine system has demonstrated this tobe a grossly mistaken assumption.The endocrine system is discussed in more detail in chapter seven, especiallywith reference to the work of Dr Theo Colborn PhD, whose 2003 article entitledNeurodevelopment and Endocrine Disruption states,> “To date no validated or standardized screens or assays have been developed to> test chemicals for their possible endocrine-disrupting effects. Consequently,> none of the thousands of chemicals used today have been tested systematically> for these effects for regulatory purposes.”This is one of the main reasons that the Paracelsus fallacy about the dose is sodangerous. A large number of devastating effects have been discovered to resultfrom very low exposure levels, many of which are significantly lower than levelsthat have been ‘scientifically’ determined to be safe.Although widely-used, DDT was not the only organochlorine pesticide to bemanufactured; Dr Blaylock describes some of the others as well as their effects,> “Chlorinated cyclodienes are the most highly toxic of any of the> organochlorine pesticides. These include chlordane, heptachlor, aldrin, endrin> and endosulfan. Excess exposure can cause seizures, continuous muscle spasms> (fasciculations), a loss of coordination, brain swelling and liver failure.”Many of these pesticides have been banned because of their proven toxicity, but,although no longer being applied, these toxins continue to pose health hazardsbecause they are persistent in the environment; chlordane, for example, is saidto persist in the soil for approximately twenty years.It is therefore inappropriate for the EPA, or any other organisation, to claimthat they can protect the environment or safeguard the food supply by settingmaximum pesticide residue levels, when the soil has been contaminated by theprior use of many different pesticides, as well as many other chemicals. In theprevious discussion about arsenic it was shown that farmland had becomecontaminated as the result of the long-term use of arsenic-based sheep dip.Organophosphates are another family of chemicals used as pesticides; they tooare inherently toxic because their intended purpose is to destroy ‘pests’.Although introduced to replace DDT, organophosphates were not new chemicals;they had been developed and brought into widespread use from the 1930s initiallyas a ‘chemical weapon’, as Mark Purdey explains in Animal Pharm,> “The German military saw their ‘potential’ and developed them as neurotoxins> for use in nerve gas.”Organophosphates are not persistent, they are unstable and break down relativelyquickly; but this does not make them safer than organochlorines. Their mechanismof action is explained by Dr Russell Blaylock in Health and Nutrition Secrets,> “Organophosphate pesticides kill bugs by inhibiting a special enzyme, also> found in humans, called cholinesterase.”Cholinesterase is an important enzyme; it is required for the proper functioningof the nervous system; however, because the human body contains the same enzymeas the ‘bugs’, exposure to organophosphate pesticides will have a similar effecton people. The fact that humans are so much larger than ‘pests’ is not arelevant criterion for determining the effects of toxic pesticides; as has beendiscussed, some chemicals produce serious effects in very low concentrations.The important point is that the effects of organophosphate exposure can bedevastating, as Dr Blaylock explains,> “Heavy exposures can cause rapid death from respiratory paralysis.”But even if exposure is not ‘heavy’, there are many other potentially seriousadverse effects, as Dr Blaylock continues,> “In fact, low-concentration exposure can produce lasting neurological> problems, such as memory defects, impaired vigilance and a reduced ability to> concentrate.”One very serious concern is that organophosphate-based chemicals are ingredientsof treatments to combat head lice and therefore mainly used for children. Thehazards associated with organophosphates indicate that the head of a growingchild should be the very last place that these neurotoxic chemicals ought to beapplied.Another effect of organophosphate exposure is that it can induce the chelationof copper from the body; this can result in copper deficiency, which is alsoassociated with neurological problems.It is clear that pesticides can produce many adverse health effects.The reason that this discussion has focused on chemicals used for ‘pest control’is to demonstrate that many chemicals are manufactured for the specific purposeof acting as a poison in order to kill ‘pests’. Yet none of these chemicals onlyaffects the intended ‘target’; they can all adversely affect a far greatervariety of living organisms than they are intended to attack, incapacitate orkill; the other species harmed by the use of pesticides are far too numerous tomention.However, the public’s attention is invariably diverted away from the dangers oftoxic chemicals and towards various scapegoats; usually ‘germs’ and ‘viruses’ inparticular. This tactic of blaming ‘germs’ instead of toxins was used to greateffect in the 2016 ‘outbreak’ of the so-called ‘Zika virus’, which was allegedto have been the cause of microcephaly and other birth defects.It is claimed that the Zika ‘virus’ is transmitted by mosquitoes; a claim thatresulted in the launch of an intensive pesticide spraying campaign in the nameof ‘protecting’ people from the ‘virus’. Yet the endocrine-disrupting chemicalsused in many of the pesticides deployed against mosquitoes are significantcontributory factors to the onset of birth defects, as will be discussed in thenext chapter.Although pesticides are produced for their ability to ‘poison’, they are not theonly chemicals in widespread use that have the ability to adversely affectliving organisms. Previous discussions have exposed the dangers associated withantibiotics. One of the major problems is the fundamental belief that ‘poisons’offer solutions to many of the problems that face humanity; in reality, it isthe plethora of manufactured chemical poisons that pose some of the greatestthreats to human health.There are clearly far too many chemicals to discuss any of them in depth;however, petrochemicals are one group that does require further discussion for anumber of reasons, one of which is that they have been shown to be directlyassociated with adverse health effects. Petroleum refining and the manufactureof petrochemicals are associated with chemicals called aromatic hydrocarbons, ofwhich there are many types, but all of them are associated with varying degreesof toxicity.There are six basic petrochemicals, two of which are benzene and toluene; theformer is a proven carcinogen, the latter a known neurotoxin. Yet, according tothe ACS (American Chemical Society) web page entitled Organic Chemistry,> “Petroleum is also the raw material for many chemical products including> pharmaceuticals...”Chlorine is also important for the manufacture of pharmaceuticals. On thewebsite of the American Chemistry Council is a page entitled Chlorine Chemistry:Providing Pharmaceuticals That Keep You and Your Family Healthy, which statesthat chlorine remains ‘present’ in many medicines.The discussion about modern medicine in chapter one referred to the toxic natureof the wastes of the pharmaceutical industry; these wastes include dioxins, asJoe Thornton explains,> “Dioxins have even been identified at low levels in wastes from the synthesis> of pharmaceuticals, presumably because chlorinated benzenes and phenols are> common feedstocks for drug synthesis.”The use of highly toxic substances as feedstocks for pharmaceuticals means thatit is entirely unsurprising that ‘medicines’ have been demonstrated to adverselyaffect health.Pharmaceuticals are not the only applications in which petrochemicals are used.The petrochemical industry claims that the six basic petrochemicals, namelybenzene, toluene, ethylene, propylene, butadiene and xylene, are used to makepetrochemical derivatives and, according to the AFPM (American Fuel &Petrochemical Manufacturers) web page entitled Petrochemicals,> “The most basic petrochemicals are considered the building blocks for organic> chemistry.”Although originally the term ‘organic’ was used in reference to livingorganisms, it has been extended to include all carbon-based chemicals, whethernatural or synthetically manufactured. Organic chemistry in the 21st centurypredominantly involves the creation of entirely new synthetic chemicalcompounds; according to the ACS web page entitled Organic Chemistry,> “The range of applications of organic compounds is enormous and also includes,> but is not limited to, pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals, food, explosives,> paints and cosmetics.”The use of synthetic chemicals in foods is discussed later in this chapter.The range of products made using organic chemistry is clearly immense, as theAFPM website states,> “Most, if not all, finished goods depend on organic chemicals.”This therefore means that virtually all industrial manufacturing depends uponpetrochemicals and therefore the oil industry.This reliance on petroleum highlights another popular theory, which is that thesupply of ‘oil’ is finite; however, as will be discussed in chapter nine, thistheory, which is also referred to as ‘peak oil’, is false. Furthermore, as alsodiscussed in chapter nine, oil is not a ‘fossil fuel’, but that does not mean itshould continue to be used. Petrochemicals are inherently toxic and thereforeinherently harmful to the environment and to all living organisms.One group of materials that are widely used in the manufacture of a vastproportion of everyday products are plastics. There are many types of plastic,but they are all said to fall into one of two categories; they are eitherthermoplastics, such as nylon, PVC and polythene, or thermosets, such as epoxyresin and urea formaldehyde.Plastics are used extensively in the manufacture of electrical and electronicequipment; this means that plastics are central to the technology industry. Alarge proportion of plastics are manufactured from materials derived frompetrochemicals and some plastics are derived from chlorine; PVC (polyvinylchloride), for example, is produced using both.As mentioned in the previous section, rare earth elements are also central tomodern technology; they are used in many items of electronic equipment, such ascomputers, tablets and mobile phone devices. Rare Earth Technology is part ofthe American Chemistry Council, Inc; on their website is an article entitledWhat Are Rare Earths? that states,> “Rare earths are a series of chemical elements found in the Earth’s crust that> are vital to many modern technologies…”A September 2016 article entitled Effects of rare earth elements on theenvironment and human health: A literature review states that one of the majorindustrial uses of rare earth elements (REE), or (RE),> “...is in the production of catalysts for the cracking of crude petroleum.”REEs are clearly vital for the oil industry; however, the article also statesthat,> “There are many environmental and health issues associated with the> production, processing and utilization of REEs.”In common with most other resources that are developed for their usefulness,REEs have been poorly studied or tested for their toxicity, as indicated by aMarch 2013 article entitled Toxicological Evaluations of Rare Earths and TheirHealth Impacts to Workers: A Literature Review that states,> “Although some RE have been used for superconductors, plastic magnets and> ceramics, few toxicological data are available in comparison with other heavy> metals.”The article focuses on occupational health hazards, which are significant forpeople who are involved in the extraction of rare earth elements because,> “Generally, most RE deposits contain radioactive materials...”The article summarises the problem and states that,> “...there are many environmental issues associated with RE production.”These environmental issues include water pollution and the destruction offarmland, both of which are associated with significant adverse health effectsfor the people living in the vicinity of such facilities.It is clear that chemicals have been exploited by many industries; this includesthe military that has taken advantage of the nature of certain chemicals, suchas sulphur and saltpetre (potassium nitrate), for example, that were used in themanufacture of explosives. The chemical industry has also directly assisted themilitary; for example, with the production of chlorine gas for use as a chemicalweapon during WWI. Although weapons of the 21st century involve highly advancedforms of technology, many chemicals are still utilised by the military.One surprising area in which the chemical industry has cooperated with themilitary is in the field of intelligence; there is ample evidence that manyintelligence agencies have employed a variety of chemicals for use in certainapplications. In their book entitled Acid Dreams, authors Martin A Lee and BruceShlain explain that, in both America and Germany, scientists have experimentedwith chemicals to ascertain their usefulness during interrogation and for morenefarious purposes, such as ‘mind control’,> “The navy became interested in mescaline as an interrogation agent when> American investigators learned of mind control experiments carried out by Nazi> doctors at the Dachau concentration camp during World War II.”After WWII, many German scientists were taken to the US under OperationPaperclip in order to assist the Americans in a variety of programmes, thebest-known of which is the American space programme; but these programmes alsoincluded the development and testing of chemicals for their potential use as‘truth drugs’. In 1942, William Donovan of the OSS (Office of StrategicServices), the precursor of the CIA, requested that a group of prestigiousscientists undertake some top-secret research. In Acid Dreams, the authors statethat the purpose of this mission,> “...was to develop a speech-inducing drug for use in intelligence> interrogations.”The research extended beyond the field of interrogation; it moved into thefields of behaviour modification and mind control under a number of differentprojects, the best known of which is Operation MKULTRA. In his book entitledOperation Mind Control, author Walter Bowart includes a copy of a document thatlists the drugs used by the CIA in their many human experiment programmes thatwere designed to investigate the ability to influence, interrogate and controlpeople. The list comprises 139 substances that include heroin, cannabis,cocaine, quinine, strychnine and morphine.Although often referred to as a separate entity from the ‘chemical industry’ asa whole, the pharmaceutical industry is, in reality, an integral part of thechemical industry. It should not be surprising therefore, that a number ofpharmaceutical drugs were included amongst the substances tested in thoseexperiments. The ‘medicines’ listed include epinephrine, insulin, novocaine andchloral hydrate.The participants in these experiments were often military personnel andinvariably volunteers, although they were generally kept ignorant of the natureof the substances they were ‘testing’ on the basis of the claim that it was amatter of ‘national security’.Legislation was introduced in the US to regulate the use of illegal drugs by thegeneral public in the 1960s; it would seem, however, that the military and CIAprogrammes were exempted from these restrictions, as the authors of Acid Dreamsexplain,> “The CIA and the military were not inhibited by the new drug laws enacted> during the early 1960s.”It would seem that they were not accountable under any other regulations either,as the authors continue,> “The FDA simply ignored all studies that were classified for reasons of> national security, and CIA and military investigators were given free rein to> conduct their covert experimentation.”One of the many substances tested by the military, in their search forsubstances that could assist them to extract information and control subjects,was LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide). These experiments were conducted despitethe claim that human experimentation is widely accepted as unethical.Nevertheless, as the authors state in Acid Dreams,> “By the mid-1960s nearly fifteen hundred military personnel had served as> guinea pigs in LSD experiments conducted by the US Army Chemical Corps.”However, LSD proved to be ineffective for intelligence gathering purposes,therefore it was decided to test a number of other drugs, one of which washeroin. This drug did prove useful, mainly because it is highly addictive; whichmeant that it allowed experimenters to ‘control’ their subjects by eitherproviding or withholding the drug. The consequences of the change from LSD toheroin are described by Walter Bowart,> “Simultaneously, as the LSD supply dried up, large supplies of heroin> mysteriously became available. It was strong heroin, imported from the Golden> Triangle in Southeast Asia (largely under CIA control).”Clearly, ‘mind control experiments’ and ‘the drugs trade’ are huge subjects thatare outside the intended scope of this book; they are, however, topics aboutwhich a great deal has been written; in addition to the books referred to aboveis The Politics of Heroin by Professor Alfred W McCoy. One of the reasons forreferring to these topics in a discussion about the chemical industry, is todemonstrate that many human experiments have been conducted that were notintended to determine the safety, or potential health effects of chemicals.It is clear that chemicals significantly contribute to pollution of theenvironment; which means that they significantly affect the health of the peoplewho inhabit that environment; these effects are almost invariably detrimental.One of the main priorities of huge corporations is to make profits for theirshareholders; their efforts to maximise profits often involve minimising costs,especially when these costs are deemed unnecessary to the goods they produce andsell. The costs that would be considered ‘unnecessary’ will inevitably includethose involved in processes to safely dispose of their toxic wastes, because, asPeter Montague indicates in his 1999 article,> “In the short run, corporations that dump their toxic wastes into a river, or> bury them in the ground, make much more money than corporations that sequester> and detoxify their wastes at great expense.”Dr Barry Commoner expands on this point in Making Peace With the Planet,> “The arithmetic is deadly: if the chemical industry were required to eliminate> toxic discharges into the environment, the cost would render the industry> grossly unprofitable.”These statements demonstrate the inherently dangerous nature of most of thesubstances manufactured by the chemical industry; many of these syntheticsubstances are used as ingredients in a wide variety of products andapplications in everyday use.Ionising RadiationThe ‘natural’ substances of which the Earth is comprised include radioactivematerials, such as uranium and its decay products; these materials together withcosmic radiation from the sun and stars are collectively referred to as ‘naturalbackground radiation’. This type of radiation is known as ‘ionising’;non-ionising radiation is discussed in the next section.Scientists estimate that the Earth is approximately four and a half billionyears old and that the first ‘life-forms’ emerged approximately three and a halfbillion years ago; natural background radiation therefore substantiallypre-dates the existence of all living organisms. However, on the basis thatliving organisms have always co-existed with this ‘background radiation’, it isassumed that there is a ‘safe’ level of ionising radiation; but this is amistaken assumption.The NIRS (Nuclear Information & Resource Service) summarises the energy ofionising radiation on a web page entitled Radiation,> “Ionizing radiation can actually break molecular bonds causing unpredictable> chemical reactions.”The NIRS fact sheet entitled No Such Thing as a Safe Dose of Radiation cites thework and words of a number of reputable scientists, one of whom is Dr Karl ZMorgan PhD, an American physicist who stated in 1978 that,> “There is no safe level of exposure and there is no dose of radiation so low> that the risk of a malignancy is zero.”The term ‘natural background radiation’ has recently been redefined andexpanded; as Dr Rosalie Bertell PhD explains in No Immediate Danger,> “Thorium, uranium, radium, radon gas and its radioactive daughter products are> officially called ‘natural background radiation’ in nuclear jargon, even> though they have been removed from their relatively harmless natural state> deep in the earth.”Dr Bertell’s use of the word ‘relatively’ indicates that, whilst they remainedundisturbed deep within the earth, these naturally radioactive substances had aminimal impact on the environmental level of ionising radiation. This point isalso made by the NIRS in their fact sheet entitled Radiation Basics that states,> “These substances were, with few exceptions, geologically isolated from the> environment under layers of shale and quartz before human beings dug them up> by the ton and contaminated the biosphere.”Once removed from their ‘relatively harmless natural state’, radioactivematerials can no longer be reasonably classified as either ‘background’ or‘natural’; as Dr Bertell explains,> “Although in a sense they are ‘natural’, they are not in their natural state.”Uranium mining is the obvious human activity that has facilitated the release ofradioactive materials from deep beneath the ground, but it is by no means theonly type of mining that can do so. Uranium ore, also known as pitchblende oruraninite, often occurs in association with copper and tin deposits; therefore,copper and tin mining have also been responsible for the release of radioactivematerials into the environment; it is reported that tin was first mined morethan two and a half thousand years ago. Pitchblende has also been found inassociation with other minerals and metals, including gold and silver. The closeproximity of radioactive substances with minerals and metals that have beenmined over the course of many centuries is clearly one of the main reasons thatmining has always been an extremely hazardous occupation.Although pitchblende was initially regarded as merely a by-product of mining, itwas found to have some useful applications; it was used, for example, as apigment for colouring glass and porcelain. However, the discovery of radium, aconstituent of uranium ore, significantly changed the perception of theusefulness of pitchblende and created an increased demand for pitchblende fromwhich radium could be extracted.Before its hazards were discovered, radium had been used in a number ofapplications, one of which was as an ingredient of the luminous paints used forwatch dials; another was as an ingredient of certain ‘medicines’. Althoughradium ceased to be used once it had been discovered to be radioactive anddangerous, its long half-life of 1600 years means that everything with whichradium had made contact remains hazardous; the NIRS reports that Marie Curie’snotebooks are still ‘dangerously radioactive’.It is clear that the environmental level of ionising radiation began togradually increase as the result of mining activities; but this was to undergo adramatic change after the summer of 1945; the NIRS summarises thistransformation on their fact sheet entitled Radiation Basics,> “Humans, through nuclear power, bomb production and testing, have created and> released man-made radioactive elements (radionuclides) that were previously> unknown in the environment.”Mankind’s curiosity and thirst for knowledge about the world understandably ledto investigations into the very nature of matter. Discoveries about atomicstructure inevitably led to the desire to discover more about the nature ofatoms; this scientific curiosity led to experiments that enabled the splittingof atoms. Nuclear fission is a process in which the nucleus of an atom is brokenor split; the result of this process is the release of a huge amount of energy.Dr Otto Hahn PhD, regarded as the father of nuclear chemistry, won the NobelPrize for his discovery of nuclear fission; the term ‘nuclear fission’ is saidto have been coined by Otto Frisch, who described the process for generating anatomic explosion. They were not the only scientists working in this field, buttheir contributions are regarded as significant to the initial processes thatresulted in the development of the atomic bomb.Only two atomic bombs have been deployed during wartime; the first was theuranium bomb dropped onto the Japanese city of Hiroshima on 6th August 1945; thesecond was the plutonium bomb dropped onto the Japanese city of Nagasaki on 9thAugust 1945. These bombs had been preceded by a single ‘test’ detonation of aplutonium bomb on 16th July 1945 in New Mexico.The level of ionising radiation in the atmosphere inevitably increased duringthe summer of 1945 as the result of these three bomb detonations, but this wasonly the beginning of the transformation of the environment. The radiationdischarged by these bombs was small by comparison to the radiation released bysubsequent tests that have detonated hundreds of nuclear bombs ofever-increasing size and power since 1945.The CTBTO (Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban TreatyOrganisation) web page entitled General Overview of the Effects of NuclearTesting cites an estimate by the NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council) thatthe total yield from all nuclear tests between 1945 and 1980 was 510 megatons(mt); the page also states that,> “Atmospheric tests alone accounted for 428 mt, equivalent to over 29,000> Hiroshima size bombs.”The development of nuclear weapons began in the US under the secret militaryprogramme known as the Manhattan Project. In her 1999 book entitled ThePlutonium Files: America’s Secret Medical Experiments in the Cold War,journalist Eileen Welsome reports the development of ‘nuclear science’ after DrOtto Hahn and Dr Fritz Strassman PhD had split the uranium atom in 1938. Manyphysicists were aware of the hazards from experimentation with radioactivematerials and were therefore concerned, as were many physicians, about thesafety of the people involved in the experiments conducted by the ManhattanProject.The dangers of radium had been revealed by the death in 1934 of Marie Curie andby the fate of the radium dial painters, many of whom had developed cancer andsome of whom had also died. Although some of the dangers associated withexposures to radioactive materials were known, scientists had little, if any,knowledge of the nature of the newly-created radionuclides that were beinggenerated by the particle accelerator, nor did they have any idea of the healthhazards they posed.Certain physicians involved in the Project devised methods to monitor theworkers by performing tests and collecting specimen samples. However, thesephysicians were largely unaware of which organs would be affected by theradionuclides, whether they would remain in the body or whether they would beexcreted. There was particular concern about plutonium and so animal experimentswere devised and conducted, as Eileen Welsome discovered. During the course ofher investigations of the animal experiments she was led to the horrifyingdiscovery that human plutonium experiments had also been conducted, as shereports,> “Beginning in April of 1945 and continuing through July of 1947, eighteen men,> women and even children, scattered in quiet hospital wards across the country,> were injected with plutonium.”Unlike uranium, plutonium is not a naturally-occurring substance; it is onlycreated within a nuclear reactor; however, like uranium, plutonium isradioactive and dangerous. There are a number of different isotopes ofplutonium, one of which, plutonium-244, has a half-life of more than 80 millionyears.Further investigations led Eileen Welsome to discover that the eighteen casesshe had initially uncovered represented only a small fraction of the totalnumber of people used as ‘guinea pigs’ for radiation experiments, as sheexplains,> “It turned out that thousands of human radiation studies had been conducted> during the Cold War. Almost without exception the subjects were the poor, the> powerless and the sick...”Further investigations reveal that civilians were not the only people used as‘test subjects’ for radiation experiments. In their 1982 book entitled KillingOur Own, journalists Harvey Wasserman and Norman Solomon report their detailedinvestigations into many cases of US military personnel who had been exposed toradiation as the result of their duties that included ‘clean-up’ operations inNagasaki and Hiroshima. These military personnel were also required to be inattendance in the vicinity of many nuclear bomb test detonations, especially theNevada Test Site and the Marshall Islands in the Pacific Ocean. The authorsdescribe some of the effects these men and women endured,> “Some developed terminal illnesses affecting bone marrow and blood production> – the kind of biological problems long associated with radiation exposure.”These illnesses included certain types of cancer, as well as a number ofdebilitating conditions,> “Others found that at unusually early ages they were plagued by heart attacks,> severe lung difficulties, pain in their bones or joints, chronic fatigue and> odd skin disorders.”Although certain effects, particularly vomiting, were experienced immediatelyafter their exposures, more serious effects developed years later; a situationthat presented difficulties for the attempts to ‘prove’ that these illnesses hadbeen the direct result of radiation exposure. Some veterans had realised thattheir exposure to radiation was the only possible cause of their severe healthissues, but their requests for assistance from the VA (US Department of VeteransAffairs) were denied. They were told that radiation could not have caused theirillness and that they had only been exposed to levels of radiation that were‘low’ and below the level that had been proven to be ‘safe’. The authors statethat the veterans were,> “...consistently ignored and denied at every turn by the very institutions> responsible for causing their problems.”One of the problems was that the ‘authorities’ had only considered thepossibility of external exposures, for which dosimeter badges had sometimes beendistributed to enable radiation levels to be monitored. However, and far moreimportantly, many veterans had also been exposed to internal radiation in thecourse of their duties. The source of their internal exposure was mainly fromthe inhalation of radiation-contaminated air; but those assigned clean-up dutiesin Hiroshima and Nagasaki would have also had internal exposures from theradiation-contaminated foods and drinks they consumed. The fact that radiationis undetectable by the senses meant that they were completely oblivious to thehazards they faced, until they began to experience a deterioration in theirhealth and the onset of some very serious health problems. Radionuclides, wheningested, are known to cause serious damage to the soft tissues of which thebody’s organs are comprised; certain radionuclides cause damage to other partsof the body; strontium-90 for example, is known to damage bone.The Nuremberg trials held after WWII resulted in a set of ethical guidelines forresearch experimentation that involved human participation; these guidelines,published in 1947, are referred to as the Nuremberg Code. One of the majorprinciples of this Code is the requirement for informed consent; which meansthat all participants must be made fully aware of the nature of the experimentand provide their consent prior to participation. In the research for her book,Eileen Welsome discovered that the Nuremberg Code had frequently been flouted inthe radiation experiments; a fact that had remained a secret for decades,> “The vastness of the human experimentation became clear only in 1994...”The information was revealed in 1994 in a US GAO (General Accounting Office)Report entitled Human Experimentation: An Overview on Cold War Programs. Thereport includes the comment that,> “GAO discussed federal experimentation on humans for national security> purposes...”The report further states that,> “The tests and experiments involved radiological, chemical and biological> research and were conducted to support weapon development programs...”The period under review includes the years between 1940 and 1974; humanexperimentation conducted after 1947 would therefore have been subject to theNuremberg Code; however, amongst its findings, the report states that,> “In some cases, basic safeguards to protect people were either not in place or> not followed. For example, some tests and experiments were conducted in> secret; others involved the use of people without their knowledge or consent> or their full knowledge of the risks involved.”During their participation in the Manhattan Project bomb test experiments, manyservicemen and servicewomen were sent to areas that were in close proximity tothe site of explosions, but rarely were they fully informed of the potentialhazards they faced; as reported by the authors of Killing Our Own. The dangersof radiation were known by the 1940s, but the bomb development programme wasdeemed to have priority, and was certainly considered to be more important thanconcerns about the consequences from increased environmental contamination withionising radiation. This opinion was, of course, held mostly by people withinthe Manhattan Project and the military establishment.Between 1945 and 1949, the US was the only country to have developed and testednuclear bombs; however, and inevitably, other nations began to develop nuclearcapabilities and create their own weapons programmes. The Soviet Union was thefirst of these other nations; their first bomb was detonated in August 1949; anevent that added further to the tensions of the Cold War period and intensifiedthe ‘arms race’ between these two ‘superpowers’.It is reported that hundreds of nuclear bombs were detonated in the atmospherebetween 1945 and 1963, after which above ground testing was prohibited under thePartial Test Ban Treaty. But radiation hazards did not dissipate when the bombtests ceased, as Dr Bertell explains,> “In above-ground nuclear weapon testing, there is no attempt to contain any of> the fission or activation products. Everything is released into the air and> onto the land.”Radioactive materials have half-lives of different duration; however, they alldecay into ‘daughter products’, some of which can be more dangerous that the‘parent’.There are five countries referred to as ‘nuclear weapon states’; these are theUS, Russia, UK, France and China. The UK tested its first bomb in 1953, Francein 1960 and China in 1964. Three more countries acknowledged to possess nuclearweapons are India, North Korea and Pakistan; it is claimed that Israel alsopossesses nuclear weapons, but that this has not been publicly acknowledged.Unfortunately, the Partial Ban Treaty of 1963 only prohibited atmospheric tests;it did not prohibit underground or underwater tests, both of which continued.Furthermore, the treaty was only signed and agreed to by three nations; the US,Russia and the UK; France continued atmospheric testing until 1974 and Chinacontinued until 1980.A Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was proposed in 1996 but, more than twodecades later, it has yet to be enacted for the simple reason that it has notbeen ratified by all countries; the most significant country that has notratified this treaty is the United States.In addition to military personnel, there is another extremely significant groupof people who have also been exposed to radiation discharged from the detonationof hundreds of nuclear bombs. This group comprises the entire civilianpopulation of the world; none of whom has ever been fully informed about thehazards to which they have been and continue to be exposed. Nor is there anyevidence that this group has ever given their informed consent to beingirradiated. Within this group there is however, a much smaller group ofcivilians who have been subjected to higher levels of radiation exposure; theseare the people who lived, and still live, ‘downwind’ of the various detonationsites around the world.In Killing Our Own, the authors provide details of the numbers of bombsdetonated each year by the US between 1945 and 1980; they total 691, of which563 are reported to have been exploded at the Nevada Test Site. Dr Bertellreports in No Immediate Danger that epidemiological studies have discovered anincreased incidence of health problems in the Nevada area; including significantincreases in the incidence of cancers. Furthermore, she explains that,> “The civilian population downwind of the Nevada test site was never warned of> the health effects which might result from their exposure.”Some of these health effects are described by the authors of Killing Our Own,> “…in one small community after another, people died from diseases rarely seen> there before: leukemia, lymphoma, acute thyroid damage, many forms of cancer.”Although the immediate vicinity of a bomb test receives a more concentrated‘dose’, the radiation released by the explosions does not remain in thatlocation. The course taken by radiation is determined by the prevailing weatherconditions; which means that radiation can spread for hundreds or even thousandsof miles, as Dr Bertell explains,> “The Nevada nuclear tests have spread radiation poisons throughout central and> eastern United States and Canada and produced in the stratosphere a layer of> radioactive material which encircles the globe.”The health hazards associated with exposure to ionising radiation areacknowledged by the WHO in the April 2016 fact sheet entitled Ionizingradiation, health effects and protective measures,> “Beyond certain thresholds, radiation can impair the functioning of tissues> and/or organs...”It is clear from this statement that the medical establishment still follows thenotion that there is a ‘safe’ threshold level of exposure, despite abundantevidence to the contrary.The Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) department of the University ofWashington published a 2006 report entitled Biological Effects of IonizingRadiation, which contains extracts from a 1990 FDA report of the same name. TheEHS report refers to the existence of knowledge about the dangers of exposure tohigh levels of radiation long before the first nuclear bombs were tested andstates that,> “Early human evidence of harmful effects as a result of exposure to radiation> in large amounts existed in the 1920s and 1930s, based upon the experience of> early radiologists, miners exposed to airborne radioactivity underground,> persons working in the radium industry and other special occupational groups.”The belief in the existence of a ‘safe’ dose or exposure unfortunately resultedin a serious delay to the discovery of the harm that low level exposures couldcause, as the report states,> “The long term biological significance of smaller, repeated doses of> radiation, however, was not widely appreciated until relatively recently...”The report claims that most of the existing knowledge has developed since the1940s. It must be emphasised that small doses do not have to be repeated inorder to be able to cause harm. The report discusses those most at risk from lowexposures,> “...embryonic and fetal tissues are readily damaged by relatively low doses of> radiation.”Dr John Gofman, who earned his PhD in nuclear and physical chemistry and laterqualified as a medical doctor, had been involved with the Manhattan Project andhad originally been supportive of atomic energy. In 1963 he was asked by the AEC(Atomic Energy Commission) to head a programme to study the effects of man-maderadiation, the result of which was anticipated by the AEC to support the plannedexpansion of the use of nuclear energy for ‘peaceful purposes’. The authors ofKilling Our Own report that the study did not support the AEC, but that itsconclusions led Dr Gofman and his team in 1969 to recommend,> “...a tenfold reduction in the AEC’s maximum permissible radiation doses to> the general public from nuclear reactors.”The result of his work led Dr Gofman to recognise that there is no safe dose ofradiation; he is quoted in the NIRS fact sheet to have stated in 1990 that,> “...the safe-dose hypothesis is not merely implausible – it is disproven.”In a 1994 interview with Synapse, a publication of the University of California,Dr Gofman referred to his long-held criticisms of the DoE and the AEC, itspredecessor. He also referred to the human body’s ability to repair a certainlevel of radiation damage and stated that, if the biological repair mechanismsare working perfectly,> “Then a low dose of radiation might be repaired.”This does not mean that a low dose is ‘safe’, but that in the absence of otherserious health issues, the body may be able to heal damage caused by a low levelof radiation.Dr Ernest Sternglass PhD is another decades-long critic of the nuclearestablishment and their efforts to play down the dangers of ionising radiation.In Secret Fallout, he demonstrates that, devastating though the immediateeffects of nuclear bombs are, the more insidious, long-term and disastrouseffects are from radioactive ‘fallout’,> “By 1953, it was already known that many of the radioactive elements (called> isotopes) created by an atomic explosion, once they entered the atmosphere in> the form of tiny fallout particles, would contaminate food, water and air and> thus find their way into the human body.”This is precisely the route by which the veterans had received their internalexposures to radioactive particles. The establishment defines radioactivity as,> “disintegration of the nuclei of certain elements, with the emission of energy> in the form of alpha, beta or gamma rays.”Ionising radiation is ‘energy’ emitted with the power to break molecular bonds,as described at the beginning of this section. When the energy breaks molecularbonds, it can dislodge electrons from an atom. These free electrons becomeelectrically charged and highly reactive. Although referred to as ‘freeradicals’, these free electrons are far more dangerous and cause far more harmthan ‘free radicals’ generated by metabolic processes."},{"pageContent":"The scientific and medical establishment have denied for many decades that lowlevel ionising radiation is dangerous; they have continued to assert that thereis a ‘safe’ threshold, despite substantial evidence to the contrary. Thissituation is, however, changing; as indicated by the WHO fact sheet that admits,> “Low doses of ionizing radiation can increase the risk of longer term effects> such as cancer.”Interestingly, a definitive refutation of the claim of the existence of a ‘safe’level of ionising radiation has been published by the prestigious NAS (NationalAcademy of Scientists). A 2005 report entitled Low Levels of Ionizing RadiationMay Cause Harm is the 7th in a series on the topic of the biological effects ofionising radiation. This report is available from the NAS website andaccompanied by a Press Release statement that quotes the words of the committeechair,> “The scientific research base shows that there is no threshold of exposure> below which low levels of ionizing radiation can be demonstrated to be> harmless or beneficial.”In other words, the scientific establishment has finally admitted that there isno ‘safe’ level of exposure to ionising radiation.It should be noted that this statement also acknowledges that no level ofionising radiation is ‘beneficial’. Yet, despite this statement, which was madein 2005, the 2016 WHO fact sheet refers to ‘beneficial applications’ of ionisingradiation in medicine; the fact sheet also indicates the immense scale of thefield of nuclear medicine,> “Annually worldwide, more than 3600 million diagnostic radiology examinations> are performed, 37 million nuclear medicine procedures carried out and 7.5> million radiotherapy treatments are given”Nuclear medicine is clearly of great financial benefit to the nuclear industry,which may explain the reluctance to recognise the scientific findings of the NASreport that stated no dose of ionising radiation can be demonstrated to beharmless or beneficial.The idea that ionising radiation could be useful in the field of ‘medicine’arose from the work of Marie and Pierre Curie, who had observed that exposuresto radium had caused the death of ‘diseased’ cells. The long-held but incorrectbeliefs about ‘diseases’ and methods of treatment have been discussed and willbe discussed in more detail in chapter ten. Nevertheless, the widespread medicalbelief that ‘disease’ must be attacked and destroyed, naturally encouraged theidea that radioactive materials may be useful in the continuing ‘battle’ againstdisease. The problems arising from the use of radiation in the treatment ofcancer are discussed in chapter seven.There are other medical applications of ionising radiation, in addition to itsuse for diagnostic examinations and for treatments. One of these applications isthe ‘sterilisation’ of medical supplies; however, although this may not resultin a direct exposure there are indirect hazards due to the existence ofradionuclides in the working environment. In his book In Pursuit of Justice,consumer advocate Ralph Nader states in his 2001 essay entitled IrradiationCraze that,> “Between 1974 and 1989 alone, forty-five accidents and violations were> recorded at US irradiation plants, including those used to sterilise medical> supplies.”Another application of ionising radiation, and one that is wholly inappropriate,is food irradiation. The FDA website contains a page entitled Food Irradiation:What You Need to Know that claims irradiated foods do not become radioactive; italso states that food irradiation,> “...is a technology that improves the safety and extends the shelf life of> foods by reducing microorganisms and insects.”This is clearly yet another application of the ‘germ theory’ and the obsessionwith killing ‘germs’. According to the FDA,> “...irradiation can make food safer.”Nothing could be further from the truth. Food irradiation is not only entirelyinappropriate, it is also highly dangerous. Irradiation affects foods at anabsolutely fundamental level, as Ralph Nader also reports in his essay,> “We do know that irradiation destroys essential vitamins and minerals in> foods...”The detrimental effects of irradiation are reported by the Center for FoodSafety (CFS) on a page entitled About Food Irradiation that states,> “Radiation can do strange things to food....”A 2006 report entitled Food Irradiation: A Gross Failure, published by the CFSin conjunction with Food and Water Watch, refers to the many research studiesthat have demonstrated that the irradiation process has detrimental effects onthe flavour, odour, appearance and texture of foods; these changes indicate thatthe foods have been dramatically altered. Furthermore, the destruction ofvitamins and minerals means that these ‘food products’ can no longer beconsidered capable of providing nourishment. The result of all these alterationscaused by irradiation means that the products subjected to this unnaturalprocess cannot be regarded as ‘food’ suitable for human consumption.An even more worrying discovery is that, according to the CFS web page,> “Research also shows that irradiation forms volatile toxic chemicals such as> benzene and toluene...”The serious health hazards associated with these highly toxic chemicals havebeen previously discussed.The nuclear industry is clearly immense; but it is also supported by a number ofextremely powerful international bodies, especially the International AtomicEnergy Agency (IAEA), a UN organisation created in 1957. The objectives of theIAEA are stated to be,> “The Agency shall seek to accelerate and enlarge the contribution of atomic> energy to peace, health and prosperity throughout the world.”These are indeed lofty aims; however, the reality of the situation is that‘atomic energy’ is entirely unable to achieve them.First of all, nuclear power has its origins within the military industry and theproduction of weapons of mass destruction. The proliferation of nuclear weaponscontinued to expand beyond 1957 when the IAEA was formed; the existence ofthousands of nuclear weapons that have the power to destroy the world many timesover cannot be called a ‘peaceful’ contribution to the world. It is usuallyclaimed that these highly destructive weapons are powerful ‘deterrents’ againstnuclear war; this argument is disingenuous, the fact that they remain inexistence means that they could be used.Secondly, atomic energy generation does not and cannot contribute to improvedhealth. Ever since the creation and detonation of the first bomb in July 1945,the environmental level of ionising radiation has increased. But, as has beenasserted by many eminently qualified scientists, there is no safe level ofexposure to ionising radiation; which means that increasing levels of radiationin the environment exacerbate health problems. Furthermore, as confirmed by theNAS report, no level of radiation is beneficial.The third claim, which is that atomic energy contributes to world prosperity, ismade on the basis of the idea that atomic energy is a cheap method forgenerating electricity. This too is a false notion, as Dr Bertell explains,> “...no country has been able to develop a commercially viable nuclear> industry. The industry is kept alive by the will of governments through> taxpayer subsidies.”If the true costs were included within the price of electricity, consumers wouldsoon realise that it is not the cheap source of power it is claimed to be; theexistence of subsidies masks the real costs.These three claims made by the IAEA about the alleged advantages of nuclearpower appear to be based more on PR than science and reality. However, theconsequences from the use of atomic energy to produce electricity extend farbeyond its failure to be commercially viable; nuclear power plants areaccompanied by many hazards that include the continual release of ionisingradiation; Dr Bertell explains,> “It is not possible to operate a nuclear plant without any releases of fission> fragments and activation products (also called radionuclides and radioactive> chemicals).”Many of the dangers posed by nuclear power reactors are reported by BeyondNuclear; one of their pamphlets, entitled Routine Radioactive Releases from USNuclear Power Plants, includes the following statement,> “Every nuclear power reactor dumps radioactive water, scatters radioactive> particles, and disperses radioactive gases as part of its routine, everyday> operation.”Furthermore, nuclear power plants only have a limited lifespan after which theyare decommissioned; but this too is highly problematic because there is no safemethod of disposal of radioactive materials, some of which have incredibly longhalf-lives that can be in the thousands, millions or even billions of years.The hazards caused by nuclear power plants are not restricted to the dischargesof radioactive materials during the course of their ‘normal’ operations; therehave been many accidents that have exacerbated the problem of environmentalcontamination with ionising radiation. The three main accidents that have beenreported were those that occurred in 1979 at Three Mile Island; in 1986 atChernobyl; and in 2011 at Fukushima.Each of these accidents should have brought the nuclear power industry to agrinding halt. But, whilst they have generated some reluctance within certaincountries to proceed with the development of nuclear energy production, theseaccidents have not generated a sufficient level of public outrage with a demandfor nuclear power to be ceased with immediate effect. The main reason for a lackof outrage is because the public is deliberately misinformed about the fullextent of the dangers associated with nuclear power generation.In addition to these ‘big’ accidents, there have been a number of ‘small’accidents, some of which have been reported to have been ‘contained’; althoughthis does not necessarily mean that they have been made ‘safe’. The total numberof ‘small’ accidents is however, entirely unknown; their existence remainslargely undisclosed, as Dr Bertell states,> “Many military accidents have gone unreported, shrouded in secrecy for> ‘national security’ reasons.”The fundamental problem with the nuclear industry is that it is inextricablyconnected to the military industry; or more correctly to the military-industrialcomplex. In fact, many industrialists are reported to have taken a keen interestin nuclear power at a very early stage of its development, as the authors ofKilling Our Own state,> “To astute financiers, the late 1940s signalled prospects for huge profits to> be made from nuclear investments.”In their book, the authors refer to a number of large US corporations thatbecame interested in industrial uses for nuclear power; many of thesecorporations remain household names.The justification for the continuing existence of a huge nuclear arsenal is theidea that they are a deterrent against war. However, although nuclear war is anextremely frightening prospect as it has the potential to annihilate the entireworld population, the very real and far more immediate danger for humanity isthe continuing contamination of the environment with ionising radiation. It hasbeen acknowledged that the greatest exposures to ionising radiation resultedfrom nuclear bomb tests, as indicated by the 2000 Report of the United NationsScientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation to the General Assemblythat states,> “The man-made contribution to the exposure of the world’s population has come> from the testing of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere from 1945 to 1980.”To this must be added the continual discharge of radioactive materials fromnuclear power stations, as well as exposures to ionising radiation from othersources, especially radiology examinations with X-rays and radiotherapytreatments.The idea that carbon dioxide poses the greatest threat to humanity is clearlyludicrous by comparison to the very real threat posed by ionising radiation,which has been proven by many eminent scientists to be hazardous at any level ofexposure.During 2017 however, hopes were raised that nuclear weapons might finally bebanned. A July 2017 page on the website of the United Nations proclaimed Treatyadopted on 7th July and explained,> “By resolution 71/258, the General Assembly decided to convene in 2017 a> United Nations conference to negotiate a legally binding instrument to> prohibit nuclear weapons leading towards their total elimination.”The treaty was endorsed by 122 of the 192 UN Member States. However, and mostsignificantly, all NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) countries, with thesole exception of the Netherlands, failed to participate in the conference.Although the Netherlands attended the conference, they did not endorse thetreaty. Unsurprisingly, the countries that did not attend the conferenceincluded the nine countries, referred to earlier in this discussion, known topossess nuclear weapons.The New York Times reported the result of the conference and treaty in anarticle entitled A Treaty Is Reached to Ban Nuclear Arms. Now Comes the HardPart that states,> “Some critics of the treaty, including the United States and its close Western> allies, publicly rejected the entire effort, calling it misguided and> reckless...”The article also reports that the US, Britain and France, three of the majornuclear ‘powers’, issued a joint statement that they,> “...do not intend to sign, ratify or ever become party to it.”It is, however, the retention of these deadly weapons that is reckless, notefforts to eliminate them.Clearly the nations that possess nuclear arsenals refuse to acknowledge thatlives are endangered by their decisions; it is no exaggeration to state that thefate of the world population rests in the hands of those who are in charge ofthese nations. The point they seem to fail to appreciate is that there could beno winner of such a war. They also fail to acknowledge that their actionscontinue to endanger the health of the entire population of the world; includingthose in charge of the weapons programmes; they are not ‘immune’ to the healthhazards caused by ionising radiation.Non-Ionising RadiationThe ‘electromagnetic spectrum’ is the term used to refer to the entire range ofelectromagnetic (EM) radiation, each type of which is described by reference toa specific range of frequencies and wavelengths.The types of EM radiation that have the highest frequencies, shortestwavelengths and sufficient energy to break molecular bonds are referred to as‘ionising radiation’, as previously discussed. All other types of EM radiationhave a wide range of frequencies and wavelengths, but do not have sufficientenergy to break molecular bonds; these are collectively referred to as‘non-ionising radiation’, which is defined on the WHO web page entitledRadiation, Non-ionizing as,> “...the term given to radiation in the part of the electromagnetic spectrum> where there is insufficient energy to cause ionization. It includes electric> and magnetic fields, radio waves, microwaves, infrared, ultraviolet and> visible radiation.”Clearly, therefore, there are many different types of ‘non-ionising’ radiation,but the fact that they do not cause ionisation does not mean that they areharmless.In common with ionising radiation, non-ionising radiation, with the exception ofvisible light, is undetectable by the senses; as Dr Robert Becker MD states inhis 1985 book entitled The Body Electric: Electromagnetism and the Foundation ofLife,> “...we can’t perceive any of these energies without instruments...”This means that people are unaware of their exposures to EM radiation; Dr Beckerexplains that the main consequence of the inability to perceive thesefrequencies is that,> “...most people don’t realise how drastically and abruptly we have changed the> electromagnetic environment in just one century.”The phenomenon of electricity is reported to have been studied since antiquity;however, during the 17th and 18th centuries, a number of significant advanceswere made in the study of this phenomenon; these advances expanded rapidly afterAlessandro Volta developed the electric battery at the beginning of the 19thcentury. Further studies and experiments led to the invention of the electricmotor and to the development of methods to utilise electricity for thegeneration of heat and light.Continuing scientific discoveries together with the development of industrialproduction processes encouraged the invention of a wide variety of machines andequipment that required electricity as their source of power. Advances in thefield of technology achieved prominence during the latter part of the 20thcentury and resulted in the development of many types of machines, equipment anddevices that utilise electricity.The expansion of technology continued at such a rapid pace that, in the early21st century, virtually all aspects of life rely on equipment powered byelectricity. This situation is regarded as synonymous with ‘progress’; as DrBecker states in his 1990 book Cross Currents: The Perils of Electropollution,The Promise of Electromedicine,> “This technological innovation has been considered essential for the> advancement of civilisation.”The AC (alternating current) system, which was invented and developed by NicolaTesla in the 19th century, is used around the world; Dr Becker explains,> “It operates at either 50 or 60 cycles per second (50 Hz or 60 Hz),> frequencies that are not present in the normal electromagnetic spectrum of the> Earth.”He states that 30Hz is the highest ‘naturally occurring frequency’ and that,> “Our use of energy for power and communications has radically changed the> total electromagnetic field of the Earth.”He adds that the consequence of such a radical change is that,> “Today, we swim in a sea of energy that is almost totally man-made.”Dr Becker’s investigations led him to conclude that exposures to these man-madeenergies were not harmless and that they can cause,> “...significant abnormalities in physiology and function.”Electricity and magnetic fields always occur together; electric currents producemagnetic fields and changing magnetic fields generate electric currents.Electromagnetic fields (EMFs) are therefore emitted by all equipment powered byelectricity, as Dr Becker explains in Cross Currents,> “The fact is that every power line and electrical appliance produces an> electromagnetic field that radiates out from it.”He also explains the consequence of the increasing proliferation of electricalequipment,> “This has resulted in the unseen contamination of our environment with> electromagnetic fields of frequencies and powers that never before existed on> this planet.”The phenomenal increase in the development of technologies that requireelectricity has created a corresponding increase in electro-pollution, the levelof which has increased to the extent that, if it were visible, the world wouldappear to be engulfed in a fog. However, in common with virtually every other‘innovation’, there has been little, if any, consideration of the potentialconsequences; Dr Becker states,> “The explosive growth in our use of electric power has occurred with few> questions being asked about the safety of living things to these abnormal> fields.”Radar provided an early contribution to electro-pollution; it was developedprior to WWII but quickly became a significant tool that was used by themilitary of both sides. In a similar manner to the development and use ofnuclear weapons, radar was also introduced and utilised before adequate safetytesting had been performed. Eventually, exposure to radar was discovered toproduce certain effects, the main one of which was tissue heating. Thisdiscovery resulted in regulations that set the maximum permissible exposure at alevel that was deemed to prevent the ‘heating effect’, on the basis that heatingwas the only effect; but this was a mistaken assumption.Dr Neil Cherry PhD, former professor of Environmental Health at LincolnUniversity in New Zealand, has written extensively on the subject ofelectro-pollution with a specific focus on the effects of EM radiation on humanhealth. In his April 2000 article entitled Safe Exposure Levels, he explains theorigin of the assumption that tissue heating was the only effect,> “In the period immediately following the Second World War, when radio and> radar had come into widespread use for the first time, there was no> epidemiology to challenge the developing view that Tissue Heating was the only> possible effect.”It should be obvious that it is inappropriate to rely solely on epidemiology todiscover the health hazards caused by new technologies, because epidemiologicalstudies can only be conducted after the technologies under investigation havebeen released onto the market and into the environment where multiple otherinfluences exist. Furthermore, epidemiological studies can only detect trends inmorbidity and mortality; they cannot determine a specific factor or influencethat has caused an increased incidence of a particular disease.The drive to introduce technological ‘innovations’ almost always overrides theconsideration of any potential adverse effects; as Dr Becker states in CrossCurrents,> “If a technology is attractive and appears to do something potentially useful,> it is avidly studied and developed. But, too often, no one will think to> determine what the exact mechanism of action is, or worse yet, whether the> technique has any harmful side effects.”Dr Becker made this comment with reference to the use of ‘high technology’ bythe medical establishment in a discussion about the use of microwaves for thetreatment of cancer. Unfortunately, the medical establishment is not fullycognisant of the electrical nature of the human body; which means that they arelargely unaware of the full extent of the detrimental effects that can be causedby exposures to EM radiation.The technology industry has grown exponentially in the past few decades, duringwhich time many new technological devices have been developed; one of the mostwidely used of these new devices is the mobile phone. It is reported that therewere approximately 2 billion mobile phones in use in 2006, but this number hasgrown at a phenomenal pace within less than a decade; as demonstrated by theOctober 2014 WHO fact sheet entitled Electromagnetic fields and public health:mobile phones, which reports that,> “Mobile phone use is ubiquitous with an estimated 6.9 billion subscribers> globally.”Mobile phones communicate via the transmission of radio waves, the effects ofwhich are still claimed to only be the heating of tissues; as the fact sheetstates,> “Tissue heating is the principal mechanism of interaction between> radiofrequency energy and the human body.”The WHO also claims in the fact sheet that the use of mobile phones will onlyinduce,> “...negligible temperature rise in the brain or any other organs of the body.”The fact sheet emphasises the view that the effect is ‘negligible’ by theadditional statement that,> “A large number of studies have been performed over the last two decades to> assess whether mobile phones pose a potential health risk. To date, no adverse> health effects have been established as being caused by mobile phone use.”But, in direct contradiction to this statement, one of the ‘key facts’ of thesame WHO fact sheet states that,> “The electromagnetic fields produced by mobile phones are classified by the> International Agency for Research on Cancer as possibly carcinogenic to> humans.”It is therefore unsurprising that, in view of these contradictory statements,the health hazards associated with mobile phone use has become a controversialtopic; this means that most people are largely unaware that the use of theirmobile phones poses distinct health hazards. Most people are also largelyunaware that there are health hazards associated with the use of alltechnological devices and equipment that utilise EM radiation, most of which isin the radio-wave and microwave frequency ranges of the electromagneticspectrum.In complete contrast to the WHO claim that there are ‘no adverse healtheffects’, is the large and growing body of evidence that reports the existenceof many adverse health effects, all of which are far more serious than ‘tissueheating’. Furthermore, these adverse effects have been discovered to occur atlevels of exposure far below that at which tissue becomes heated. Some of theearly studies that discovered adverse health effects were carried out in the1960s by Russian scientists who labelled them as ‘Radiofrequency SicknessSyndrome’, which Dr Cherry explains in his Safe Exposure Levels article,> “It has symptoms of functional changes in nervous and cardiovascular systems,> such as headaches, fatigue, irritability, sleep disturbance, weakness,> decreased libido, chest pains and bradycardia.”Bradycardia means a slow heart rate.The failure of the medical establishment to recognise the full extent of thenature of the human body as bioelectrical as well as biochemical means thatphysicians are not trained to recognise symptoms, such as those listed above, tobe the result of exposure to radiofrequency waves. Patients with these symptomsmay even be recommended to undergo further tests that may include the use ofradiological equipment, which will exacerbate their body burden of EM radiationand worsen their symptoms.The wide range of adverse health effects caused by exposures to artificial EMradiation is described in the BioInitiative 2012 Report, which was prepared by29 authors from 10 countries; these authors include 10 medical doctors and 21PhDs. The 2012 Report, which is available from the website (bioinitiative.org),is an update to the 2007 Report; it contains more than 1,400 pages and includes1,800 new studies. The Report also includes a Summary for the Public, theintroduction to which states,> “Environmental exposures to artificial EMFs can interact with fundamental> biological processes in the human body.”The Summary reports that many studies have found that biological processes aredisturbed by artificial EMFs at levels orders of magnitude lower than those atwhich tissues are heated and explains,> “In the last few decades, it has been established beyond any reasonable doubt> that bioeffects and some adverse health effects occur at far lower levels of> RF and ELF exposure where no heating (or induced current) occurs at all; some> effects are shown to occur at several hundred thousand times below the> existing public safety limits where heating is an impossibility.”RF refers to radio frequency and ELF refers to extremely low frequency.It should be noted that the IARC has classified both RF and ELF as Group 2Bcarcinogens; this means that they are both categorised as ‘possibly carcinogenicto humans’. These classifications provide a further contradiction to the WHOclaim that there are no adverse health effects from exposures to thesefrequencies.The human body is an electro-chemical system, in which the chemical andelectrical aspects are intimately interconnected; they interact at a fundamentallevel. Exposures to toxic chemicals can disrupt the electrical as well as thechemical systems; likewise, exposures to artificial EM radiation can alsodisrupt both systems. Furthermore, in the same way that the endocrine systemrequires only tiny amounts of hormones to function, the body’s electrical systemalso requires only tiny amounts of electrical energy to function, as Dr Beckerstates in Cross Currents,> “The body’s internal energetic control systems are subtle, and they operate> with minute amounts of electromagnetic energy.”He adds that,> “A little goes a long way, and very often, more is not better.”It is clear from the growing body of evidence that ‘more’ EM radiation has beenproven to be decidedly harmful.Unfortunately, the situation is likely to worsen with the continuing developmentof new technologies; as indicated by the WHO web page entitled Electromagneticfields that states,> “Electromagnetic fields of all frequencies represent one of the most common> and fastest growing environmental influences about which anxiety and> speculation are spreading. All populations are now exposed to varying degrees> of EMF, and the levels will continue to increase as technology advances”The reference to the spread of ‘anxiety and speculation’ indicates that the WHOdoes not accept the huge body of scientific evidence that demonstratesconclusively that artificial EMFs cause many adverse health effects. It alsoindicates that by ignoring the evidence the WHO is failing to fulfil its statedaim to achieve ‘health’ for everyone.The powerful electromagnetic fields that radiate from the plethora oftelecommunications and electrical power sources can and do disrupt the body’sbio-electrical system at the cellular level. In his 2012 article entitled TheBiological Effects of Weak Electromagnetic Fields, Dr Andrew Goldsworthy PhDsummarises the situation and states that,> “...the evidence that alternating electromagnetic fields can have non-thermal> biological effects is now overwhelming.”The studies included in the BioInitiative Report refer to a variety ofnon-thermal effects that can induce a wide range of symptoms, some of which maybe mild, such as headaches, others may be far more serious, such as heartproblems and cancers. Dr Goldsworthy explains the effects that occur at acellular level,> “The explanation is that it is not a heating effect but mainly an electrical> effect on the fine structure of the electrically-charged cell membranes upon> which all living cells depend.”The magnitude of the effect will depend upon which part of the body is affected.As will be further discussed in chapter seven, the endocrine system isparticularly sensitive and can be disrupted by exposure to EM radiation. Allhormones are important; any disruption to their production and release, whetherfrom chemical or electrical influences, will affect the body’s ability tofunction properly. However, disruption to the production of melatonin can have asignificant impact on a number of important functions. In his 2002 articleentitled, EMF/EMR Reduces Melatonin in Animals and People, Dr Neil Cherryexplains the range of possible effects from low levels of melatonin in the body,> “...reduced melatonin output causes many serious biological effects in humans> and other mammals, including sleep disturbance, chronic fatigue, DNA damage> leading to cancer, cardiac, reproductive and neurological diseases and> mortality.”Melatonin is an extremely potent antioxidant; inadequate levels of thisimportant hormone can therefore result in increased levels of metabolic freeradicals that can cause damage at a cellular level. As Dr Cherry indicates, thedamage from insufficient melatonin and excess free radicals can lead to cancer.The association between exposures to EM radiation and cancer is demonstrated bythe IARC classification of RF and ELF as ‘possible’ human carcinogens; theBioInitiative Report however, states the case rather more strongly,> “There is little doubt that exposure to ELF causes childhood leukaemia.”Exposure to ELF generates elevated risks for a number of types of cancer, butmost of them develop slowly over the course of a number of years. This meansthat the likelihood of associating a person’s prior exposure to EM radiationwith the later onset of cancer is fairly slim; however, exposure to EM radiationis only one of many factors that contribute to the development of cancer, asdiscussed in more detail in chapter seven.In a disturbingly familiar situation, certain frequencies of ‘non-ionising’radiation are utilised by the medical establishment in certain applications,most of which are based on the ability of these frequencies to produce heat inthe body.One of the first applications to be developed was ‘diathermy’, which is the useof radio wave frequencies for the ‘treatment’ of a number of differentconditions, which originally included arthritis, migraine headaches and cancer.Dr Becker explains the origin of diathermy in Cross Currents and states that, inthe late 1920s, workers at a factory that was developing an experimental radiotransmitter with a high frequency began to feel ill. The most significantsymptom they experienced was a raised body temperature, or fever, which themedical establishment of the period attributed to being a ‘good’ reaction toillness and injury. This led to the idea that heat could be induced using theseradio frequency waves, which, in turn, led to the development of ‘diathermy’ asa method for treating various conditions of illness. Dr Becker notes thatdiathermy can produce a number of ‘undesirable side effects’, which includesweating, weakness, nausea and dizziness. Diathermy continues to be used,although for a smaller range of ailments; it is now mainly used as a method oftreatment for muscle and joint conditions.A more recent medical application that uses EM radiation as a method to induceheat is called ‘hyperthermia’, which is a cancer treatment that utilises certainfrequencies to heat cancer cells in order to kill them. Hyperthermia refers toan elevated body temperature; hypothermia is the term that refers to a low bodytemperature. An ACS article entitled Hyperthermia to Treat Cancer states that,> “Radio waves, microwaves, ultrasound waves, and other forms of energy can be> used to heat the area.”The idea on which this treatment is based is that tumours have a high watercontent and are therefore susceptible to high heat, however, the ACS admits thatthere are side effects from this treatment but claims that,> “Most side effects don’t last long, but some can be serious.”Hyperthermia treatment can be applied to large or small areas of the body; whenapplied to a small area it is referred to as ‘local hyperthermia’, the sideeffects of which are described in the ACS article,> “Local hyperthermia can cause pain at the site, infection, bleeding, blood> clots, swelling, burns, blistering, and damage to the skin, muscles, and> nerves near the treated area.”Although called ‘side effects’, it should be obvious that they are directeffects; they also provide a clear indication of the extent of the damage thatthis ‘treatment’ can cause.Diathermy and hyperthermia are treatments that obviously rely on the heatingeffect of EM radiation frequencies; but, as demonstrated by many studies, ‘heat’is not the only effect. Furthermore, and most importantly, the BioInitiativeReport states unequivocally that some effects occur at levels far below that atwhich heating occurs, as indicated by the so-called ‘side effects’ listed above.Yet, as demonstrated by the WHO fact sheet, the medical establishment refuses toacknowledge the existence of these non-thermal effects; the ‘attractiveness’ ofthe technology has yet again overpowered the objective contemplation of possibleadverse effects and their detrimental consequences for health.Another example of a medical technology that uses EM radiation, although not forthe ‘heating effect’, is MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), which is described onthe NHS web page entitled MRI scan as,> “...a type of scan that uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce> detailed images of the inside of the body.”The dangers associated with X-rays and CT scans, both of which use frequenciesin the ionising range of the electromagnetic spectrum, have led to theassumption that MRI scans are safer because they use frequencies in the‘non-ionising’ range of the spectrum. The fact that the IARC has classified RFwaves as a ‘possible’ carcinogen for humans should raise questions about theclaim that MRI scans are ‘safe’.The Johns Hopkins Medicine Health Library web page entitled How Does an MRIwork? states that they can be used for imaging any part of the body, includingthe brain and explains that,> “The magnetic field, along with radio waves, alters the hydrogen atom’s> natural alignment in the body.”The radio waves are pulsed; when they are turned on, they cause the protonswithin the hydrogen atoms to be ‘knocked out of alignment’; the protons realignwhen the waves are turned off. This is clearly an unnatural process; however,the UK NHS refers to it as,> “...one of the safest medical procedures currently available.”The fact that many studies have demonstrated the adverse effects of RF waves atexposure levels that are orders of magnitude lower than those deemed ‘safe’,should raise serious and fundamental questions about the appropriateness of thisprocedure.Although reports are occasionally published about the hazards associated withexposures to artificial EM radiation, there are a number of obstacles thatimpede public awareness of the full extent of the problem. Many of theseobstacles have been recognised and explained in the BioInitiative Report in theSummary for the Public,> “The exposures are invisible, the testing meters are expensive and technically> difficult to operate, the industry promotes new gadgets and generates massive> advertising and lobbying campaigns that silence debate, and the reliable,> non-wireless alternatives (like wired telephones and utility meters) are being> discontinued against public will.”Another obstacle is that the work of scientists, who have discovered the adverseeffects of exposures to EM radiation and attempt to inform the public, isdiscredited by other scientists who refute their findings. This problem is alsoexplained in the BioInitiative Report Summary,> “Other scientific review bodies and agencies have reached different> conclusions than we have by adopting standards of evidence so unreasonably> high as to exclude any conclusions likely to lead to new public safety> limits.”There are reasons that different scientists reach different conclusions;however, some of these reasons are not based in science nor are they based onthe findings from scientific research. The BioInitiative Report lists 10reasons, the most significant of which is a familiar obstacle to publicawareness,> “Vested interests have a substantial influence on the health debate.”The main vested interests behind the censorship of information about the hazardsof exposures to artificial EM radiation are, unsurprisingly, the technology andtelecommunications industries. Another significant ‘vested interest’ with astrong influence over technology and the use of various electromagneticfrequencies, is the military industry, as explained by Dr Becker in CrossCurrents,> “Military services of every country use all parts of the electromagnetic> spectrum for communications and surveillance...”It is important to reiterate that the problem is not ‘technology’ per se. Theproblems that exist have been caused by the type of technology that has beendeveloped, together with the range of electromagnetic frequencies that have beenused for the operation of those technologies; the effects they produce have beenproven beyond doubt to be detrimental to health.Despite the increasing volume of evidence that electromagnetic radiation in theradiofrequency range causes harm, new technologies that utilise thesefrequencies continue to be developed. The most significant development withrespect to the current discussion is 5G, the new generation oftelecommunications systems that has begun to be introduced earlier than hadoriginally been planned. One of the most likely reasons for this early release,is to avoid the possibility that efforts to issue a moratorium until potentialhealth hazards have been fully investigated will be successful.The ‘establishment’ promotes 5G as able to facilitate faster speeds and greatercapacity to meet increasing demand for access to wireless technologies; however,it should be noted that 5G will augment not replace the earlier generations of2G, 3G and 4G. This means that 5G will involve further substantial increases inthe concentration of radiofrequency radiation within the environment.A major aspect in which 5G differs from its predecessors is the use offrequencies in the millimetre wave (MMW) range. However, MMWs do not traveleasily through obstacles such as buildings and can be absorbed by foliage andrain; the proposed solution involves the installation of huge numbers of ‘smallcell towers’ placed at relatively short distances apart. A February 2018 articleentitled Towards 5G communications systems: Are there health implications?explains that MMW have not been fully tested but that,> “Preliminary observations showed that MMW increase skin temperature, alter> gene expression, promote cellular proliferation and synthesis of proteins> linked with oxidative stress…”Although untested for the full extent of their health effects, millimetre wavesare currently utilised for certain effects they are known to produce. The EHT(Environmental Health Trust) website contains a wealth of information about 5G,including a page entitled 5G And The IOT: Scientific Overview of Human HealthRisks, which, under the heading 5G Frequencies are used in weapons, states,> “Millimeter waves are utilized by the US Army in crowd dispersal guns called> Active Denial Systems.”The sensation created by these waves is said to be that the body feels as if itis on fire; however, although tissue heating is a recognised effect, it has beenconclusively shown that damage occurs at a far lower exposure level than that atwhich heating occurs.It is abundantly clear that the increased concentration of RF-EMF in theenvironment resulting from 5G technology will, unless prevented, generate aconsiderable increase in a variety of adverse health problems.Hydraulic Fracturing (Fracking)The term ‘hydraulic fracturing’, also known as ‘fracking’, refers to theunconventional drilling operations used to extract oil and gas that are tightlyheld within rock formations deep underground and inaccessible to conventionaldrilling operations.There are many different stages to fracking operations. The first stage is theinitial drilling deep underground to reach the oil- or gas-bearing rock layer.Once this layer has been penetrated, the drilling direction is changed fromvertical to horizontal and drilling proceeds through the rock layer for therequired distance, after which the drilling is discontinued and the drillsremoved from the ‘well’.The next stage involves the injection of millions of gallons of ‘fracking fluid’under extremely high pressure into the well; it is the pressure of this fluidthat fractures the rock in several places and forces the released oil or gas toflow up to the surface where it is ‘captured’. Fracking fluid typically consistsof water, sand and a variety of chemicals; the reason that sand is incorporatedinto the fluid mix is because the sand grains hold open the fractures in therock and create gaps through which the gas or oil can flow.The technique of hydraulic fracturing was pioneered by the US where it was firstintroduced commercially in 1949. Although the processes have changed in theintervening decades, the US has nevertheless engaged in these operations longerthan any other country and therefore has the greatest experience of its use. TheUS also has the greatest experience of its consequences, which is the reasonthat this discussion will focus on research that relates to fracking operationsconducted there. The discussion will also focus mainly on the extraction of gas,or ‘natural gas’ as it is also called.Hydraulic fracturing is claimed by the establishment to be both efficient andsafe; it is also promoted as necessary in order to gain increased access to oiland gas resources, which are considered to be vital for many industrialpurposes, as previously discussed. These claims are grossly misleading; frackingis not only inefficient, it is extremely dangerous in a number of ways, as thisdiscussion will demonstrate.One of the main research efforts to expose the dangers of fracking has beenconducted by Dr Theo Colborn PhD and her colleagues, who, in 2011, published astudy article entitled Natural Gas Operations from a Public Health Perspective.This study is the source of most of the reference quotes used in thisdiscussion; these quotes will be referred to as the Study; all other referencequotes will be identified by their sources in the usual manner.Although fracking operations generate a number of hazards, the major hazard fromthe perspective of ‘public health’ is environmental pollution due to the toxicnature of the chemicals used as ingredients of fracking fluids. The exactcomposition of these fluids, however, is unknown because, as the Study explains,> “The technology to recover natural gas depends on undisclosed types and> amounts of toxic chemicals.”The industry claims that the reason fracking companies withhold details abouttheir products is because this is ‘proprietary information’ that needs to bekept ‘secret’ from their competitors. This claim is intended to convey theimpression that non-disclosure is merely a question of gaining a competitiveadvantage over rival companies and therefore simply a matter of ‘business’, butthis claim is disingenuous and the impression misleading.The details about chemicals used in fracking fluids are not merely withheld fromcompetitors, they are also withheld from the EPA. This means that theorganisation tasked with the responsibility of protecting human health, as wellas the health of the environment, is unable to fulfil its mission becausesubstances unknown to them are being discharged into the environment. Thissituation also raises questions about the approval processes that permit the useof products that contain undisclosed ingredients.Although the exact details of all ingredients of fracking fluids are unknown,some scientists have been able to obtain a certain amount of information aboutsome of the chemicals used. The TEDX (The Endocrine Disruption Exchange) websiteprovides information about the research conducted by Dr Colborn and hercolleagues and includes a page that contains links to a number of peer-reviewedresearch papers, which detail a variety of adverse health effects shown to havebeen caused by the chemicals found in association with fracking operations. TheStudy reports that,> “A list of 944 products containing 632 chemicals used during natural gas> operations was compiled.”The Study acknowledges that this is not a complete list,> “...but represents only products and chemicals that we were able to identify,> through a variety of sources, as being used by industry during natural gas> operations.”The list of chemicals identified by the Study reveals that a significantpercentage of them are highly toxic. These chemicals include arsenic, barium,benzene, cadmium, cyanide, fluoride, lead, mercury, methylene chloride, toluene,uranium, radium-226 and radium -28, which are some of the most dangeroussubstances known to science. Each of these 13 substances has been proven to beextremely toxic and highly dangerous; their combined toxicity is however,entirely unknown. There is no evidence that any tests have been conducted todetermine the health effects from this combination, which it would be noexaggeration to describe as a highly lethal cocktail. Yet these deadly poisons,together with many hundreds of other chemicals, many of which remainundisclosed, have been pumped under the ground in order to extract oil andnatural gas.As part of their investigations, Dr Colborn and her colleagues obtained CAS(Chemical Abstract Service) numbers for 353 of the chemicals they had discoveredwere used in fracking operations. These CAS numbers enabled them to obtainfurther information, especially in respect of the adverse health effectsassociated with these chemicals, about which the Study states,> “...more than 75% of the chemicals on the list can affect the skin, eyes, and> other sensory organs, the respiratory system, the gastrointestinal system and> the liver.”These are not the only effects; the Study also discovered that,> “More than half the chemicals show effects on the brain and the nervous> system.”The reported adverse health effects are those that have been shown to beassociated with exposures to each individual chemical; there is no informationabout the health effects from exposures to any combinations of multiplechemicals.The Study refers to some of the functions attributed to these chemicals tojustify their use as ingredients of fracking fluids,> “Chemicals are added to increase the density and weight of the fluids in order> to facilitate boring, to reduce friction, to facilitate the return of drilling> detritus to the surface, to shorten drilling time, and to reduce accidents.”The reason that these processes are facilitated by some of the most toxicchemicals known to science remains unclear. Unsurprisingly though, the industryclaims that fracking fluids do not pose any hazards to health, as the Studyreports,> “Industry representatives have said there is little cause for concern because> of the low concentrations of chemicals used in their operations.”This is clearly another practice that is based on the Paracelsus theory that a‘low dose’ is not a ‘poison’; but, as discussed, this theory is not onlyunproven it has been repeatedly demonstrated to be false. The Study confirmsthis stance in the statement that,> “...pathways that could deliver chemicals in toxic concentrations at less than> one part-per-million are not well studied and many of the chemicals on the> list should not be ingested at any concentration.”The previous discussion about chemicals showed that no chemical has been fullytested for all possible effects; but, more specifically, no chemical has beenthoroughly tested at very low exposure levels to determine its effects on theendocrine system. This means that the oil and gas industry’s assertion thatthere is no need for concern about the low concentrations of chemicals isunfounded. Many of the scientific studies that have been conducted demonstratethat, contrary to the industry’s claim, there is a genuine cause for concern.In addition, the assertion that fracking fluids only contain low concentrationsof chemicals is disingenuous; fracking operations utilise millions of gallons offluids, therefore a low concentration is not synonymous with a low volume. A‘low concentration’ within millions of gallons of liquid can translate tohundreds if not thousands of gallons of fluids containing hundreds of differenttoxic chemicals. Yet no tests have been performed to determine the safety ofthese compounds or to investigate the possible health effects.The existence of synergistic interactions between chemicals is well-known; somechemical interactions have been shown experimentally to produce a level oftoxicity that is many times greater than would be expected by their combinedtoxicities. The extent and nature of all possible synergistic interactionsbetween the hundreds of chemicals used in fracking fluids is entirely unknown;they have never been studied. As previously stated, science has no method toanalyse multiple substances, which means that science is unable to determine theconsequences arising from the chemical compounds used in fracking products. Itis important to reiterate that the health of the environment and the health ofthe inhabitants of that environment are inextricably interconnected.Although some aspects of fracking operations remain unknown, certain aspects areunder investigation, the most important of which are the effects on humanhealth; there is an increasing level of awareness that fracking operations areassociated with increased health problems for people living in their vicinity.Even the medical establishment has reached a limited recognition of the risksposed to health by fracking operations; as indicated by an October 2016 articleentitled Fracking Linked to Cancer-Causing Chemicals, New YSPH Study Findspublished on the website of the Yale School of Public Health (YSPH). Thisarticle reports that more than 1,000 chemicals were examined in their analysisand states that,> “An expansive new analysis by Yale School of Public Health researchers> confirms that numerous carcinogens involved in the controversial practice of> hydraulic fracturing have the potential to contaminate air and water in nearby> communities.”The work of Dr Colborn and her colleagues demonstrates that the contaminationand hazards are not merely ‘potential’; environmental contamination and theirassociated adverse health effects have become all too real for many residentsliving in the vicinity of fracking operations. The Study demonstrates that theadverse health effects are not restricted to cancer.One major environmental impact of fracking operations is the chemicalcontamination of water, as indicated by a March 2012 report entitled Fracking:The New Global Water Crisis that was prepared by Food & Water Watch and states,> “There are many ways that drilling and fracking contaminate public freshwater> resources.”In December 2016, the EPA announced the release of their report entitledHydraulic Fracturing for Oil and Gas: Impacts from the Hydraulic FracturingWater Cycle on Drinking Water Resources in the United States, which states,> “EPA found scientific evidence that activities in the hydraulic fracturing> water cycle can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances.”The phrase ‘under some circumstances’ is an understatement; the EPA report alsoincludes the statement that,> “Of the 1,606 considered in the final assessment report, 173 chemicals (11%)> have chronic oral toxicity values that can be used for human health risk> assessment.”Although this may suggest that the majority of the chemicals used do not havechronic oral toxicity values, that does not mean that fracking fluids do notpose serious threats to the environment or to human health; the extremelydangerous nature of the 13 chemicals referred to above demonstrates conclusivelythat these fluids are inherently harmful. Furthermore, the EPA admits in theirreport that there is a paucity of data about the toxicity of many of thechemicals used,> “The lack of peer-reviewed toxicity data presents a significant limitation in> assessing the severity of impacts on drinking water resources...”The reliance on ‘peer-reviewed’ data is problematic for reasons that will bediscussed in chapter nine; however, it should be noted that the studies listedon the TEDX website are also peer-reviewed.One of the ways that fracking operations impact drinking water resources isthrough the contamination of groundwater with toxic chemicals, because not allof the fluid injected underground is returned to the surface. This means that aproportion remains underground; however, the percentage of the fluid returned tothe surface can vary considerably, as disclosed by the Study,> “An estimated 10% to 90% of the fracking fluid is returned to the surface> during well completion and subsequent production...”The proportion of the fluid that remains underground will therefore also rangebetween 10% and 90%; this means that groundwater at a very deep level can becontaminated by chemical seepage from the ‘fracked’ rock layer. Unfortunately,the oil and gas industry denies that there are any reasons for concern; whichmeans that no measures are taken to protect the integrity of this vital sourceof fresh water.It is clear that there are many undisclosed aspects of fracking operations; theyinclude undisclosed quantities of fracking fluids composed of undisclosedcombinations of chemicals of unknown degrees of toxicity, and these fluids arereleased into the environment with unknown effects and consequences. It is alsoabundantly clear that the quality of the fresh water supply that lies deepunderground is directly and seriously compromised by the toxic chemicals used infracking operations. However, surface water can also be contaminated by frackingfluids that can seep into local water sources from leaks, spills and accidents,all of which are documented occurrences.Other unknown aspects of these operations are the exact composition and natureof the materials that are returned to the surface. The reason that this is amatter for concern is because these returned fluids contain materials inaddition to those that were intentionally injected into the well. This problemis exposed in the Study that refers to the fluid that is returned to thesurface,> “...bringing with it toxic gases, liquids and solid materials that are> naturally present in underground oil and gas deposits.”Although fluids are returned to the surface, they are no longer usable; asituation that highlights another major impact of fracking operations, which isthe depletion of fresh water, the main ingredient of the fracking fluid.The water used in fracking operations is invariably sourced from local sourcesof water, typically from rivers and lakes as well as reservoirs and municipalwater supplies. The extraction of millions of gallons of water for use byfracking operations significantly reduces the volume of fresh water available tosupply the needs of local residents, not only for drinking but for many otherpurposes. The reduction of fresh water available for farming and agriculturewill inevitably have a significant impact on local food production.Another environmental hazard, in addition to the contamination and depletion ofwater, is created by the methods utilised to dispose of the fracking fluidsafter they have been returned to the surface. One of these methods displays theindustry’s complete disregard for the integrity of the environment, as the Studystates,> “In the western United States it has been common practice to hold these> liquids in open evaporation pits until the wells are shut down, which could be> up to 25 years.”The Study explains that evaporation pits have only been subjected to limitedexaminations; which means that the composition of the materials in these pits islargely unknown, because poorly studied, and therefore the health hazards theypose are also largely unknown. However, the fact that toxic chemicals comprisesome of the original ingredients of the fluids means that the contents of theevaporation pits will inevitably be toxic; as the Study confirms,> “Our data reveal that extremely toxic chemicals are found in evaporation> pits.”Another method used for the disposal of the returned fluids involves theirre-injection underground; a process that is utilised in some parts of the US, asreported in the Study,> “In the eastern United States, and increasingly in the West, these chemicals> are being re-injected underground, creating yet another potential source of> extremely toxic chemical contamination.”The idea of burying ‘waste’ is not new; it is a method used for the disposal of‘ordinary waste’, which has resulted in the huge and ever-increasing number oflandfill sites that contaminate vast areas of land in most, if not all countriesaround the world.Underground burial does not and cannot solve the problem of toxic waste; itmerely relocates the problem. But this method also generates a further level ofenvironmental contamination, the consequences of which are also unknown becausethey have not been studied. One inevitable impact of the burial of toxicsubstances will be on food crops grown in contaminated soil moistened bycontaminated water. When buried underground, the toxic fluid wastes will alsopoison the myriad of organisms that dwell in the ground and are vital to thehealth of the soil.Another method for the disposal of fracking wastewater is through sewagetreatment plants. Fortunately, this is not a widely-used method because thesetreatment plants are unable to process and detoxify liquids contaminated withhighly toxic chemicals. There are serious implications that arise from theinability of sewage or water treatment plants to detoxify chemicals; these arediscussed in more detail later in this chapter.In addition to contaminating water, the chemicals used in fracking operationsalso contaminate the air in the immediate vicinity. Some of the chemicalsinvolved in these operations are classified as volatile organic compounds(VOCs); which means that they can readily become airborne. Not all VOCs areinherently toxic; however, the Study mentions certain VOCs that are known to beused in fracking operations and are known to be toxic,> “In most regions of the country, raw natural gas comes out of the well along> with water, various liquid hydrocarbons including benzene, toluene,> ethylbenzene and xylene (as a group, called BTEX) hydrogen sulphide (H2S), and> numerous other organic compounds that have to be removed from the gas.”These VOCs can mix with other compounds, including any ‘natural gas’ that hasescaped from the wells, and with diesel exhaust. The combination of thesecompounds produces ‘ground level ozone’, the dangers of which are also explainedin the Study,> “One highly reactive molecule of ground level ozone can burn the deep alveolar> tissue in the lungs...Chronic exposure can lead to asthma...and is> particularly damaging to children...”This is not only dangerous to humans, as the Study also states,> “Ozone not only causes irreversible damage to the lungs, it is similarly> damaging to conifers, aspen, forage, alfalfa and other crops...”One of the primary components of ‘natural gas’ is methane, which is a highlyflammable gas that contributes further to the hazards associated with hydraulicfracturing. The March 2012 Food & Water Watch report refers to a number ofincidents that have occurred as the result of the escape of methane gas fromnearby fracking operations. In one of these incidents, a house is reported tohave exploded due to the infiltration of highly-flammable methane gas into thewater supplied to the house. In another incident, the contamination of the localwater supply with ‘natural gas’ required the intervention of the EPA, whoseofficials instructed the local inhabitants not to drink the contaminated water.These are not isolated incidents; as the report indicates,> “ProPublica identified more than 1,000 cases of water contamination near> drilling sites documented by courts, states and local governments around the> country prior to 2009.”The Food & Water Watch group condemns fracking in that it entails,> “...a legacy of air pollution, water pollution, climate pollution and public> health problems.”The main health problems associated with fracking operations are due toexposures to the toxic chemicals used in these operations that contaminate thewater and air. But, as with deleterious effects caused by many pollutants, thehealth problems from exposures to toxic fracking fluids are unlikely to berecognised by physicians who are simply not trained to detect symptoms caused bychemical poisoning. People affected by these toxic substances will most likelybe prescribed a pharmaceutical drug intended to alleviate their symptoms; but nodrug can effectively ‘treat’ health damage that has been caused by chemicalpoisoning.A further consequence of hydraulic fracturing operations is one that has seriousrepercussions for the entire region in which they are conducted. There is agrowing body of evidence that fracking operations can generate increasedearthquake activity. An April 2016 article entitled Do fracking activities causeearthquakes? Seismologists and the state of Oklahoma say yes states that,> “University of Calgary seismologist David Eaton says in the past six years, 90> percent of earthquakes larger that magnitude three taking place in the Western> Canada Sedimentary Basin can be linked to fracking or waste water disposal.”The article also states that, in David Easton’s opinion,> “...the earthquakes are being caused by changes in pressure underground.”There are clearly a large number of detrimental effects due to frackingoperations that together far outweigh any of the purported benefits that theindustry claims are gained.It is obvious from their report about the impacts of fracking operations ondrinking water that the EPA is aware that these operations can contaminate theenvironment; but this raises the question of why regulations have not been ableto curb the polluting activities of the oil and gas industry. The alarminganswer to this question is that, in the US, fracking operations have beenexcluded from certain aspects of legislation designed to protect theenvironment. The oil and gas industry clearly have very powerful lobbyists thathave been extremely successful in protecting their clients. The Study explainsthe situation,> “In tandem with federal support for increased leasing, legislative efforts> have granted exclusions and exemptions for oil and gas exploration and> production from a number of federal environmental statutes...”Objections to fracking operations have been raised by various groups concernedwith the environment, although unfortunately these objections are mainly basedon two issues. One of these issues is ‘climate change’, the problem with whichhas been discussed. The other issue relates to the theory that petroleum is a‘fossil fuel’, which is another incorrect theory, as will be discussed furtherin chapter nine.The main, and most important, objection to the activities of the oil and gasindustry that are labelled ‘hydraulic fracturing’ is the danger they pose to theenvironment and, by extension, to the health of all inhabitants of thatenvironment. Nevertheless, the oil and gas industry continue their efforts toexpand fracking operations into as many countries around the world as possible.Fortunately, there is a growing resistance to these efforts; some countries haverecognised the dangers and are resisting the industry; some have evenimplemented a ban on fracking operations.The consequences of allowing these dangerous activities to continue must not beunderestimated; as summarised on the TEDX website,> “As natural gas production rapidly increases across the US, its associated> pollution has reached the stage where it is contaminating essential life> support systems – water, air, and soil – and causing harm to the health of> humans, wildlife, domestic animals, and vegetation.”GeoengineeringThe term ‘geoengineering’ is a bona fide scientific term; a 2009 Royal Societyreport entitled Geoengineering the climate: Science, governance and uncertaintydefines it as,> “...the deliberate large-scale intervention in the Earth’s climate system, in> order to moderate global warming.”The report claims it is a matter of urgency that all nations implement measuresto achieve worldwide reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. It is furtherclaimed that, should these measures fail to halt the ever-rising globaltemperatures, geoengineering techniques may be implemented as auxiliary measuresto mitigate the problem.Nevertheless, despite this official recognition, geoengineering is a highlycontroversial topic. One of the main reasons for the controversy arises fromassertions by establishment scientists that geoengineering remains purelytheoretical; whereas a large and growing body of evidence strongly indicatesotherwise.There are four key features of the topic that require further examination, theseare: the purpose for which geoengineering is claimed to be required; the natureof the climate interventions; the evidence that geoengineering is an activeprogramme; and the use of geoengineering interventions for purposes other thanthe mitigation of ‘global warming’, or ‘climate change’ as it is now called.According to the Royal Society report, the purpose of geoengineering is to‘moderate global warming’, a topic that was briefly mentioned at the beginningof this chapter. However, although an in-depth examination is beyond theintended scope of this discussion, it is important to discuss some of the keyissues involved.First of all, it is an indisputable fact that the climate changes; the pointthat is disputed is the idea that any significant changes in the climate have adistinct, identifiable cause that has been proven to be almost entirelyanthropogenic in nature. The palaeoclimatologist Professor Robert Carter refutesthis simplistic approach by his comment in Climate: The Counter Consensus that,> “...climate is a complex, dynamic, natural system that no one wholly> comprehends...”Although the climate system is not fully comprehended by anyone, establishment‘climate scientists’ assert that the driving force of climate change is theatmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide. Despite the seemingly authoritativenature of this assertion, it is incorrect; the evidence from Antarctic ice corerecords conclusively demonstrates that increases in temperature precedeincreases in atmospheric carbon dioxide. In his February 2012 article entitledCO2 is not a Greenhouse Gas that Raises Global Temperature. Period!climatologist Dr Tim Ball PhD states that,> “...the only place in the world where a CO2 increase precedes and causes a> temperature increase is in global climate models.”The global climate models he refers to are those used as the basis forpredictions about the climate in the future; however, as Professor Carterstates,> “...computer models predict future climate according to the assumptions that> are programmed into them.”It is clear therefore, that computer-generated global climate models programmedwith assumptions based on flawed theories about carbon dioxide will producepredictions that are not reliable indicators of the climate of the future. DrBall emphasises this point in his statement that,> “IPCC models are programmed so a CO2 increase causes a temperature increase> despite the evidence.”The IPCC is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.The fact that no scientist fully comprehends the real climate system means thatnone of the assumptions programmed into computer models will accurately reflectthe climate system in the real world. Professor Carter explains that thefundamental problem of ‘climate science’ is that,> “There is no established Theory of Climate...”To summarise: there is no established theory of the climate; no scientist fullycomprehends the complex climate system; climate computer models are programmedusing biased assumptions; and the basic assumption that carbon dioxide causesincreases in the temperature is demonstrably false. The combination of thesefactors means that there is no justification for the implementation of‘interventions’ in the climate with the objective of reducing the globaltemperature.Unfortunately, flawed theories and a lack of detailed knowledge about a topic donot seem to impede the introduction of technologies, for which there may beunforeseen and unintended consequences that may not be easily rectified. Thereis clearly a faction within the scientific community that has no qualms aboutusing the planet as their experimental laboratory.According to the Royal Society report, geoengineering interventions fall intotwo categories, which are labelled carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and SolarRadiation Management (SRM).In addition to not being the cause of climate change, carbon dioxide is notdangerous; as the earlier discussion explained, it is essential for plantgrowth, which makes it essential for food production and therefore for life onplanet Earth, as many living organisms are dependent on plants for their foodsupply. CDR procedures are clearly inappropriate; however, they are not thefocus of this discussion.Of particular concern are the interventions and technologies associated with thecategory of SRM, the function of which, according to the report, is to,> “...reduce the net incoming short-wave (ultra-violet and visible) solar> radiation received, by deflecting sunlight, or by increasing the reflectivity> (albedo) of the atmosphere, clouds or the Earth’s surface.”The report acknowledges that SRM strategies would not address the alleged‘problem’ of atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide; they are, however, intendedto mitigate the effects. In other words, SRM interventions are intended toreduce the absorption of solar radiation in order to assist the process ofcooling the Earth, despite the complete absence of evidence that the planet isundergoing ‘unprecedented warming’.The interventions suggested under the category of SRM include the use of‘stratospheric aerosols’; however, the report only discusses the use ofsulphur-based chemicals such as hydrogen sulphide or sulphur dioxide, both ofwhich are claimed to be able to induce a cooling effect. Significantly thereport adds the comment that, although reference is only made to the use ofsulphate particles,> “This does not mean that some other type of particle may not ultimately prove> to be preferable to sulphate particles.”The evidence indicates that many other types of particle have proved to bepreferable to sulphur-based substances.Another ‘suggested’ SRM technique refers to the introduction of materials to actas sun-shields that will reflect solar radiation; one of the proposals for thistechnique includes the use of,> “a superfine mesh of aluminium threads...”The reason for selecting aluminium is because it is a highly reflective metal.The documentary film entitled What In The World Are They Spraying (WITWATS) wasproduced in 2010. The research for this film involved the attendance of thefilmmakers at the February 2009 AAAS Geoengineering Conference, one of the mainspeakers at which was Professor David Keith, a key scientist in the field ofgeoengineering and a member of the working group that authored the 2009 RoyalSociety report.The documentary refers to the work of a number of researchers, including formerUSDA biologist Francis Mangels PhD, who have independently collected soil andwater samples from a variety of locations in the US, including snow from MountShasta, a pristine mountain range at a significant distance from industrialactivities. The samples were analysed and demonstrated to contain unusually highconcentrations of certain materials, most notably aluminium, but also barium andstrontium. Dr Mangels also reported that his analysis over a period of years haddemonstrated that the soil pH had altered so significantly that, instead ofbeing acidic, it had become alkaline.The researchers referred to in the WITWATS documentary are not the only ones tohave analysed soil and water samples and found many anomalous results. Thesediscoveries cannot be dismissed as irrelevant to the strategies to be employedin geoengineering programmes; the high concentration of aluminium in water andsoil samples is highly correlated with the ‘suggested’ use of aluminium toreflect solar radiation.Human intervention in the climate is not, however, a recent phenomenon; thereare many historic precedents, as indicated by Professor James Fleming who, inhis essay entitled The Climate Engineers, refers to,> “...the long and checkered history of weather and climate control...”He explains that some of the earliest ‘weather manipulation’ experiments wereconducted during the 19th century and that these were largely attempts to inducerain or to increase rainfall. He also indicates that rainmaking experimentscontinued into the 20th century, although the nature of the experiments changedwith the introduction of new technologies.An August 2001 article entitled RAF rainmakers caused 1952 flood reports that,on August 15th 1952, the English town of Lynmouth was hit by a ‘flash flood’that has been described as one of the worst to have occurred. The articlereports that, according to unearthed documents, ‘rainmaking experiments’ hadbeen conducted by scientists and the British RAF during the two weeks prior tothe flood. Although it is officially denied that these experiments caused theflood, the close timing of these events cannot be easily dismissed as a chance‘coincidence’.Experiments of a similar nature have also been conducted in the US, especiallyby certain factions within the US military during the Cold War period. Thereason that ‘weather manipulation’ interests the military is that the ability tocontrol the weather is considered to be a very useful tool; it can be used todisrupt the operations of the enemy. It is officially reported that weathermanipulation programmes were conducted during the Vietnam War. One of theseprogrammes, codenamed Operation Popeye, involved a number of aircraft flightsthat released particles of silver iodide in order to increase precipitation andtherefore disrupt the movements of the enemy.It is clear therefore from these and many other examples that ‘weathermodification’ techniques have been utilised, particularly by the military.However, these activities were ostensibly curtailed by the UN Convention on theProhibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental ModificationTechniques (ENMOD) that came into force in 1978. According to Professor Fleming,under the ENMOD Convention, the term ‘environmental modification’ means,> “...any technique for changing – through the deliberate manipulation of> natural processes – the dynamics, composition or structure of the Earth,> including its biota, lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere, or of outer> space.”The ENMOD treaty should therefore preclude all activities intended todeliberately manipulate the atmosphere or alter the weather or the climate; thiswould include all of the activities ‘suggested’ by climate scientists andreported in documents such as the Royal Society report. The evidence indicatesthat this treaty has at the very least been circumvented, if not completelydisregarded, not only by scientists but also by the military. Although it isclaimed that none of the suggested geoengineering techniques has beenimplemented, the evidence indicates otherwise.There are a number of factors involved in presenting the evidence to support theclaim that geoengineering is an active programme; one of these factors requiresa discussion about aircraft trails. The term ‘contrail’ is defined by the USNOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) as follows,> “A contrail is the condensation trail that is left behind a passing jet> plane.”The NOAA explains how these trails are formed,> “Contrails form when hot humid air from jet exhaust mixes with environmental> air of low vapour pressure and low temperature.”It is clear therefore, that these trails are formed under specific atmosphericconditions; the NOAA describes their duration,> “The length of time that a contrail lasts is directly proportional to the> amount of humidity that is already in the atmosphere.”This means that all aircraft flying within the same atmospheric conditions atsimilar altitudes ought to produce ‘trails’ that are very similar, if not thesame, in appearance. Empirical evidence obtained from direct observation ofaircraft in the sky demonstrates that this is not the case; different aircraftcan be seen to leave different kinds of trails, despite flying at similaraltitudes and in similar atmospheric conditions.Some of these trails bear no resemblance to the ‘contrails’ described by theNOAA. Many aircraft eject long white trails that remain in the sky long afterthe planes have disappeared from view. Each trail continues to spread in widthand often merges with other trails to form a misty white blanket across largeregions of the sky. It should be noted that the Royal Society report suggeststhat ‘cloud condensation nuclei’ increase the formation of clouds, which reducesolar radiation.These long white trails that are clearly not condensation trails have becomeknown as ‘chemtrails’, which is not a recognised scientific term, mainly becausethe mainstream scientific community denies the existence of any trails otherthan ordinary ‘contrails’. The reason they have become known as ‘chemtrails’ isbecause they contain a variety of chemical substances, including aluminium,barium, strontium and silver, which, although ejected by aircraft into the sky,do not remain there. These substances descend to the ground where theycontaminate the soil and water, as indicated by the results of soil and wateranalyses.Many of these substances are hazardous to health, but their dangers areexacerbated by the use of extremely fine particles, or nanoparticles as they aremore correctly called. One of the metals detected in extremely highconcentrations is aluminium, which, as previously discussed, is neurotoxic. DrRussell Blaylock explains the dangers posed by nanoparticles of aluminium in hisJuly 2013 article entitled Impacts of Chemtrails in Human Health. Nanoaluminum:Neurodegenerative and Neurodevelopmental Effects,> “It has been demonstrated in the scientific and medical literature that> nanosized particles are infinitely more reactive and induce intense> inflammation in a number of tissues.”In his article, Dr Blaylock expresses his concerns about the adverse healtheffects on the neurological system due to exposures to aluminium nanoparticles,> “Of special concern is the effect of these nanoparticles on the brain and> spinal cord, as a growing list of neurodegenerative diseases, including> Alzheimer’s dementia, Parkinson’s disease, and Lou Gehrig’s disease (ALS) are> strongly related to exposure to environmental aluminium.”A 2004 study by Mark Purdey reveals health hazards associated with some of theother toxic metals that have been found in unusually high concentrations,especially silver (Ag), barium (Ba) and strontium (Sr). The study is reported inhis article entitled Elevated silver, barium and strontium in antlers,vegetation and soil sourced from CWD cluster areas: do Ag/Ba/Sr piezoelectriccrystals represent the transmissible pathogenic agent in TSEs? CWD is chronicwasting disease, which is regarded as a TSE that is only experienced by certaintypes of deer. The discussion in chapter five about BSE referred to the claimthat a protein called a ‘prion’ is regarded as the cause of all TSEs, butdemonstrated that this is not the case. In the abstract of his article, MarkPurdey indicates clearly that ‘atmospheric spraying’ was not theoretical in2004,> “The elevation of Ag, Ba and Sr were thought to originate from both natural> geochemical and artificial pollutant sources – stemming from the common> practise of aerial spraying with ‘cloud seeding’ Ag or Ba crystal nuclei for> rain making in these drought prone areas of North America, the atmospheric> spraying with Ba based aerosols for enhancing/refracting radar and radio> signal communications as well as the spreading of waste Ba drilling mud from> the local oil/gas well industry across pastureland.”Although CWD is alleged to be restricted to certain members of the deer family,silver, barium and strontium have known adverse health effects for many livingorganisms, including humans.Allan Buckmann trained as a US Air Force weather observer and worked in thisfield for the military during the early 1960s; he also trained as a wildlifebiologist, which enabled him to recognise wildlife health problems. In hisAugust 2012 article entitled Chemtrail Whistleblower Allan Buckmann: SomeThoughts on Weather Modification he states,> “The cloud nuclei being used are composed of metallic salts in nano form, all> potentially toxic to life as we know it. We have documented accumulations of> aluminium, strontium, barium and many others in the soil, the rainwater, snow> and plants at levels thousands of times higher than any normal condition, and> many should not be present at all.”In the article he also refers to the replacement of sulphur-based materials withthose of other metals,> “The USAF and NASA say aluminium coated fibreglass (chaff) is 20 times more> reflective than sulphur and the metallic particles have strong electromagnetic> properties.”The use of weather modification by the US military in programmes such asOperation Popeye, indicates that any technology with a perceived usefulness fortheir operations is invariably incorporated into military projects andprogrammes. Although geoengineering is claimed to be solely for the purpose ofmitigating global warming, there is evidence that the military industry hasdeveloped climate intervention technologies that are capable of altering farmore than just global temperatures and for more nefarious purposes. To discussthese purposes requires reference to another controversial programme, namelyHAARP (High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program), which is described byco-authors Dr Nick Begich PhD and Jeane Manning, in their book entitled AngelsDon’t Play This HAARP, as,> “...a research program designed to study the ionosphere in order to develop> new weapons technology.”The authors refer to the ionosphere as a shield that protects the planet frombombardment by high energy particles and explain that,> “The transmitter or HAARP device on the ground is a phased array antenna> system – a large field of antennas designed to work together in focusing radio> frequency energy for manipulating the ionosphere.”The discussion about non-ionising radiation highlighted the dangers ofintroducing ‘unnatural’ frequencies into the environment of the planet; this‘environment’ is not restricted to the lower atmosphere. The potential hazardsthat could result from experimental manipulation of the ionosphere is furtherexplained by Dr Begich in his article entitled Ground Based ‘Star Wars’, inwhich he states that,> “The ionosphere is alive with electrical activity, so much so that its> processes are ‘non-linear’. This means that the ionosphere is dynamic, and its> reactions to experiments are unpredictable.”The unpredictable nature of their experiments has rarely stimulated thescientific community, or the military, to proceed with caution or to considerthe full extent of the potential consequences of their actions prior toconducting full-scale experiments; the detonation of the first nuclear bomb is aprime example.The poor level of understanding about the nature of the climate system is alsoexplained by Dr Begich and Jeane Manning, who state that,> “...leading edge scientists are describing global weather as not only air> pressure and thermal systems, but also as an electrical system.”One of the key drawbacks of the early ‘weather manipulation’ techniques wastheir lack of ability to control and steer the weather systems they produced;this capability is, however, provided by HAARP. The ability to steer the weatheris clearly unrelated to ‘global warming’, ‘climate change’ or to ‘carbon dioxideremoval’; it has a far more nefarious purpose that is described by ProfessorGordon MacDonald in his 1968 essay entitled How To Wreck the Environment,> “Among future means of obtaining national objectives by force, one possibility> hinges on man’s ability to control and manipulate the environment of his> planet.”Although wrecking the environment is not the intended goal of programmesdesigned to manipulate the environment, the techniques involved certainly havethe ability to do so; as Professor MacDonald states,> “When achieved, this power over his environment will provide man with a new> force capable of doing great and indiscriminate harm.”The main goal of these programmes is to develop technologies that can be used toachieve ‘national objectives’ through the use of force or the threat of force.It is for this reason that the main ‘power’ in this field is wielded by themilitary. This is further demonstrated by Dr Rosalie Bertell, who states in her1996 article entitled Background on the HAARP Project that,> “Basic to this project is control of communications, both disruption and> reliability in hostile environments.”In her book entitled Chemtrails, HAARP, and the Full Spectrum Dominance ofPlanet Earth, author Elana Freeland refers to patent #4,686,605 entitled Methodsand Apparatus for Altering a Region in the Earth’s Atmosphere, Ionosphere,and/or Magnetosphere. This patent was held by Bernard Eastlund, an Americanphysicist and advocate of weather manipulation; it is claimed by Dr Begich thatthis patent is the basis for HAARP, although it is officially denied. Theabstract of the patent states,> “The region is excited by electron cyclotron resonance heating to thereby> increase its charged particle density.”Any technologies implemented in accordance with this patent would clearlycontravene the terms of the ENMOD convention.Elana Freeland explains in her book that HAARP can be used to heat theionosphere, which would create high-pressure areas that can be used to move thejet stream. This can significantly alter the weather at specific locations tocreate floods or droughts, which, as indicated by Professor MacDonald, can beused to achieve ‘national objectives’ by a different type of ‘force’ than theusual tactics employed by the military.Documents and information about technologies developed for use by the militaryare invariably kept secret under the rubric of ‘national security’.Occasionally, however, useful information does become available; one example isa document entitled Weather as a Force Multiplier: Owning the Weather in 2025, a1996 USAF research paper. The Executive Summary at the beginning of thisdocument includes the following statement,> “A high-risk, high-reward endeavour, weather-modification offers a dilemma not> unlike the splitting of the atom. While some segments of society will always> be reluctant to examine controversial issues such as weather-modification, the> tremendous military capabilities that could result from this field are ignored> at our peril. From enhancing friendly operations or disrupting those of the> enemy via small-scale tailoring of natural weather patterns to complete> dominance of global communications and counterspace control.> Weather-modification offers the war fighter a wide-range of possible options> to defeat or coerce an adversary.”Prior to the implementation of any large-scale programme that conductsexperiments to manipulate the climate and has the potential to affect the entirepopulation of the world, there ought to be a public debate that would raise theessential question articulated by Professor Fleming in his previously citedessay,> “Who would be given the authority to manage it?”With his knowledge of history, he supplies a response indicating the most likelycandidates,> “If, as history shows, fantasies of weather and climate control have chiefly> served commercial and military interests, why should we expect the future to> be different?”It is time to expect a different future and to wrest control over the climate ofthe planet out of the hands of the commercial and military interests! Althoughthe geopolitical aspect of the efforts to control all of the resources of theworld are beyond the intended scope of this book, further indications of thestrategies involved and the manner in which they are promoted to the generalpublic are discussed in chapters eight and nine.It should be clear from the weight of evidence, only some of which has beenpresented in this discussion, that despite the establishment claims to thecontrary, geoengineering is not a ‘theoretical’ programme; it is an active onewith additional and far more sinister purposes than the stated objective ofaddressing the alleged problem of ‘climate change’.Poisoned FoodFood can be ‘poisoned’ in a few different ways, both directly and indirectly;the deliberate poisoning of food with intent to cause harm does not, however,form any part of this discussion.Food can be directly, although unintentionally, poisoned by toxic substancesused for other purposes; the spraying of food crops with pesticides, forexample. Food crops can be indirectly poisoned by natural toxic substanceswithin the environment, such as arsenic in the soil or water, or by unnaturaltoxic substances that have been released into the environment, radiationfallout, for example. Important and relevant though they all are, these ways inwhich food can be poisoned have been discussed elsewhere.The purpose of the following series of discussions is to reveal another way inwhich certain foods are directly ‘poisoned’; but before embarking on adiscussion with the ominous title of ‘poisoned food’ it is important to clarifythese terms to avoid misunderstanding.The word ‘poison’ refers to a substance that interferes with the body’s normalfunctions by causing damage to cells and tissues. The extent of the damage thata poison can inflict on the body depends mainly, but not entirely, on its innatetoxicity; it also depends on other factors, as will be discussed in chapter ten.It may be assumed that the meaning of the word ‘food’ is universally understoodand requires no further clarification; but this would be a mistaken assumption,because the word is often applied to substances that do not conform to its truemeaning. The fundamental purpose of food is to supply the body with thematerials necessary for normal functioning; these materials are collectivelyknown as ‘nutrients’.In his book entitled Excitotoxins: The Taste That Kills, Dr Russell Blaylockexplains that,> “Every second of every day thousands of chemical reactions are taking place> throughout every cell and in every tissue of the body.”He expands on this point and states that,> “The primary purpose of eating is to support these chemical reactions.”Dr Blaylock indicates that the reactions he refers to are ‘biochemical’ innature rather than simply ‘chemical’. Chemistry and biology are separatescientific disciplines, although they converge in the field of ‘biochemistry’,which is defined as the study of the chemistry of living organisms, as describedon the Biochemical Society website that states,> “It is a laboratory based science that brings together biology and chemistry.”Laboratory experiments conducted by biochemists primarily involve the study ofprocesses at the cellular and molecular level and of the substances necessary tothose processes. These substances include proteins, many of which are essentialfor the body’s biochemical reactions. However, investigations that arerestricted to the study of isolated substances and processes within the confinesof the laboratory, cannot facilitate a full understanding of their role in thecomplex, interconnected, self-regulating living organism that is the human body.The body’s biochemical reactions are supported by the chemicals obtained fromfood; but these chemicals must be in the ‘right’ form in order to be metabolisedand utilised by the body to power the vital processes of life; Dr Blaylockexplains,> “Many of the substances absorbed from our food play a vital role in the> overall metabolic process of life.”It is clear therefore, that foods must provide the range of nutrients necessaryto support those metabolic processes; which means that ‘nutritious foods’ arekey elements of a ‘healthy diet’. The medical establishment however, maintains aslightly different perspective; as indicated by the October 2018 WHO fact sheetentitled Healthy diet, which claims that,> “A healthy diet helps to protect against malnutrition in all its forms, as> well as noncommunicable diseases (NCDs)…”This is another demonstration of the medical establishment’s incompleteunderstanding about nutrition, because a healthy diet does not merely ‘help’ toprotect against ‘disease’. Furthermore, according to the February 2018 WHO factsheet entitled Malnutrition,> “Malnutrition refers to deficiencies, excesses, or imbalances in a person’s> intake of energy and/or nutrients.”The topic of malnutrition is discussed in chapter eight; however, it isimportant to make the point for the current discussion that the word does notmerely refer to a deficiency of food. The claim by the WHO that malnutrition isthe result of an imbalance in a person’s intake of energy is also misleading. Acalorie is a unit of ‘energy’, it is not a unit of ‘nutrition’; these terms arenot synonymous. It is possible for a ‘foodstuff’ to provide calories but not tocontain any nutrients; a substance of this nature would not support the body’svital metabolic processes and cannot therefore be correctly described as ‘food’.The Healthy diet fact sheet does refer to aspects of a diet that are important,such as the consumption of fruit and vegetables; it also recommends that theintake of fats, free sugars and salt should be limited. This recommendation issupported by the February 2018 WHO fact sheet entitled Obesity and overweight,which suggests that the food industry can also assist by,> “...reducing the fat, sugar and salt content of processed foods.”The recommendation to reduce fat, sugar and salt intake suggests that thesesubstances form part of a healthy diet, provided they do not exceed a certainlevel of intake, but this too is misleading. Although the request to the foodindustry to reduce them would be useful, it is inadequate, because excess fat,sugar and salt content are not the only problems associated with manufacturedfood products, as the discussions in the following sections will demonstrate.The body absorbs and metabolises foods in order to extract the nutrients;however, processed food products manufactured by the food industry containvarious synthetic chemicals that are used in production processes to performcertain ‘technological functions’, as will be discussed. These syntheticchemicals do not contribute to the nutritional content of foods, but they arenot harmless. Any chemical food ingredient that is not a nutrient can react withother substances within the body, but these reactions are not part of the body’snormal and vital metabolic processes. Instead, the ‘non-nutrient’ chemicals caninterfere with ‘normal’ processes at the cellular level; it is whollyappropriate, therefore, to describe these chemicals as ‘poisons’.The food industry is immense; it is reported to be one of the largest industriesin the world. It is certainly regarded as one of the most important, mainlybecause it is claimed that the food industry is vital to ensure a continuingsupply of food for the ever-increasing population of the world. The theory onwhich this claim is based is seriously flawed, as will be explained in moredetail in chapter eight.The manufacture of food is governed by a variety of laws and regulations thatwere created to ensure that food products meet certain criteria, which includethe requirements for food to be ‘safe’ and fit for consumption. One of the mainreasons for the original introduction of food legislation was to address theproblem of food adulteration, which generally entails the addition ofingredients that make the resulting product of a lower quality than it isperceived to be. Although the adulteration of food can involve the use of toxicsubstances, this is not always the case; for example, in the 19th century it wasa not uncommon practice to add chicory as a ‘filler’ ingredient to coffee. Theresulting product had certainly been adulterated because it was no longer ‘pure’coffee; however, chicory is not toxic, therefore the coffee had not been‘poisoned’.Unlike most 21st century food outlets, the grocery shops of earlier periods didnot sell many pre-packaged goods; instead they mainly held loose commoditiesthat were sold in the quantities requested by customers. This situation providedopportunities for some of the more unscrupulous traders to increase theirprofits by adulterating their loose commodities with cheap ‘filler’ ingredients.Unfortunately, not all adulterations were as innocuous as the addition ofchicory to coffee.The practice of adulteration in England was first exposed in the early 19thcentury by Friedrich Accum, a German chemist who lived and worked in London. In1820 he wrote a book entitled, A Treatise on Adulterations of Food and CulinaryPoisons, the purpose of which he claimed was,> “...to put the unwary on their guard against the use of such commodities as> are contaminated with substances deleterious to health.”He provides a number of examples of contaminated foods,> “Our pickles are made green by copper, our vinegar rendered sharp by sulphuric> acid....”Other examples include such delights as custard poisoned with laurel leaves, teafalsified with sloe leaves, pepper mixed with floor sweepings and sweets dyedred with lead. None of these examples are mere ‘adulterations’; the foods hadbeen contaminated by substances that were decidedly ‘deleterious to health’ andare clear examples of ‘poisoned food’.Another form of adulteration perpetrated by unscrupulous traders was theaddition of ingredients to a food that had perished, and should therefore nolonger have been available for sale. Friedrich Accum reports that an example ofthis form of adulteration involved the addition of either rice powder orarrowroot to bad milk, which was then sold as ‘cream’. This practice was clearlyintended to deceive the public about the quality of the product but the addedingredients did not poison the basic food; their purpose was to mask the factthat it was not fit for consumption.Friedrich Accum left England in 1821 and the battle against food adulterationwas temporarily suspended. It was, however, resumed in the 1850s by ThomasWakley, a surgeon and the founder of The Lancet, and Dr Arthur Hill Hassall, aphysician. Together these men investigated a number of foods and discovered manythat had been adulterated; their findings were published in The Lancet. Theinvestigations conducted by these men and other food safety campaigners, such asJohn Postgate, finally led to the enactment of legislation, namely the 1860 FoodAdulteration Act, which was the first in a series of laws passed in England inthe effort to protect the integrity of foods.Food adulteration was not exclusive to England; the battle against the problemin America was led by Dr Harvey Washington Wiley MD, who is regarded as theforemost pioneer of the effort to protect the safety of food in the US. Theresult of his work and campaigning was the enactment of legislation, the 1906Pure Food and Drug Act, which also enabled the creation of a US governmentagency that, in 1930, became the FDA (Food and Drug Administration). The 1906Act states the purpose of the legislation to be,> “For preventing the manufacture, sale, or transportation of adulterated or> misbranded or poisonous or deleterious foods...”Similar problems also occurred in other countries; these problems were allseemingly solved by the creation of laws and regulations intended to protectfoods, and to ensure they were ‘safe’ and suitable for consumption.Unfortunately, this period was also the era during which the ‘germ theory’became increasingly accepted as the explanation for ‘diseases’, and the term‘safe’ became synonymous with ‘free from germs’; an idea that remains firmlyentrenched within the regulations that govern the food industry in the 21stcentury.During the 20th century, the food industry expanded rapidly and food tradebecame increasingly ‘international’, culminating in many efforts that aimed toachieve ‘harmonisation’ of the food laws and regulations within all countries.The most significant endeavour of this nature was the creation, in the early1960s, of a joint FAO/WHO food standards programme and the formation, in 1963,of the CAC (Codex Alimentarius Commission). The 2016 meeting of the CAC producedthe fourth edition of the report entitled Understanding Codex, which states,> “The Codex Alimentarius, the compilation of Codex standards, guidelines and> codes of practice, are developed jointly by experts from Codex Members> representing over 99% of the world’s population.”This report, which will be referred to as the Codex report, describes CodexAlimentarius as a ‘global rule book’. Although the Codex standards are clearlyintended to be implemented by every Codex Member, they are referred to as‘voluntary’; which means that they are only enforceable within each countrythrough the creation of the appropriate legislation. The Codex report indicateshowever, that many countries have already adopted the appropriate measures toalign many of their food standards with those of Codex Alimentarius.The justification for the creation of Codex food standards rules is claimed bythe Codex report to be that everyone has,> “...the right to expect their food to be safe, of good quality and suitable> for consumption.”This ‘right’ is not disputed; everyone does have the right to consume food of ahigh standard and of good quality. Unfortunately, the food industry dependsheavily on ‘science’, especially chemistry, and on technology to provide thesubstances and processes with which foods can be claimed to meet therequirements of safety, quality and suitability. This dependence is supported bythe laws and regulations, as the Codex report states,> “Sound science, inclusiveness and consensus are at the heart of the Codex> mandate to protect consumer health.”In the utilisation of synthetic chemicals to perform ‘technological functions’that are claimed to generate foods that meet the requirements of Codex and allother food standards, the food industry has overlooked the fundamental purposeof food, which is to provide nutrients, but synthetic chemicals do not containnutrients.As previous discussions have demonstrated, medical establishment practices arebased on flawed theories with respect to the human body, disease and health. Theregulations that govern the food industry for the purpose of ‘protecting’consumer health operate from the basis of the same flawed theories, especiallythe ‘germ theory’ and the notion that a substance can only be a poison when itexceeds a certain dose.The consequences of basing food regulations on flawed theories and a poorunderstanding of nutrition, are that most processed ‘food products’ manufacturedby the food industry fail to fulfil the basic purpose of food; they contain few,if any, nutrients, but, more importantly, they contain many substances that canbe correctly described as ‘poisons’.Manufactured Food ProductsThe large-scale manufacture of food began during the era of the IndustrialRevolution. Assisted by the development of certain materials, processes andtechnologies, the food industry expanded rapidly during the 20th century and hascontinued to grow to the extent that, in the early 21st century, manufacturedfood products comprise a substantial proportion of all ‘food’ sold and consumedaround the world.The Codex report referred to in the previous section indicates the magnitude ofthe output of the food industry,> “According to FAO trade statistics, the value of trade in food exceeded US$> 1.12 trillion in 2013 and is increasing.”This statistic has immense implications for the claims made by the establishmentabout food scarcity and the existence of hunger; these topics are discussed inchapter eight.The Codex report refers briefly to the history of food laws and mentions thatsome harmful chemicals were used to adulterate foods; it also refers to the factthat ‘science’ was utilised to expose the adulteration of food; these pointswere discussed in the previous section. However, ‘science’ is now used for theopposite purpose, as it is employed to justify the use of chemicals in food.It is an acknowledged fact that all living matter is made of ‘chemicals’; thisalso applies to food, as indicated by the EFSA (European Food Safety Authority)on the web page entitled Chemicals in food that claims,> “All food is made up of chemical substances.”This claim tends to create two impressions; one is that all ‘food’ can be viewedas merely a conglomeration of chemicals; the other is that all forms ofchemicals are the same. However, these are both mistaken impressions.The real definition of ‘food’ refers to substances that provide the body withnutrients, which are chemicals of a very specific nature.Chemicals can be formed in different ways; they can be entirely syntheticsubstances created in laboratories; they can be synthetic compounds derived fromnatural materials or they can be entirely natural substances. Syntheticchemicals, including those that have been derived from natural materials, arenot the same as natural chemicals. However, this does not mean that ‘natural’ issynonymous with harmless; previous discussions have demonstrated that manynatural substances are extremely toxic. Of particular importance is that thesynthetic compounds used in the manufacture of food products are often derivedfrom petrochemicals, which are inherently toxic to the human body and thereforetotally unsuitable for human consumption.The EFSA acknowledges, to a certain extent, that some chemicals may cause‘effects’ but claims that they are not harmful,> “...unless we are exposed to them for a long time and at high levels.”The dependence on ‘science’, and particularly on the Paracelsus fallacy, becomesall too apparent in the additional EFSA statement that,> “Scientists help to safeguard against these harmful effects by establishing> safe levels.”If a substance used in a food has the ability to cause harmful effects it is, bydefinition, a poison; which means that the adulteration of food with substancesthat are ‘deleterious to health’ was not abolished by the creation of foodsafety laws and regulations.In his 1982 book entitled Beating the Food Giants, Paul Stitt, a biochemist whoworked in the food industry for a number of years, discusses many aspects offood manufacturing including the use of chemicals, about which he states,> “An ever-increasing proportion of the food we eat is no longer food but is now> a conglomerate of high-priced chemistry experiments designed to simulate> food.”The increased reliance by the food industry on the ingenuity of chemists hasresulted in the situation whereby synthetic chemicals can also be used toreplace basic ingredients, as Paul Stitt explains,> “When flavors, colors, texture, indeed when the food itself is synthesized,> the corporations are freed from dealing with the cost and bother of real foods> like vegetables and fruit.”The activities of the food industry include the packaging and distribution ofwhole foods including produce, such as fruits and vegetables, that do not becomeingredients of processed food products. These whole and fresh foods are not themain focus of this discussion, although it should be noted that they may besubjected to certain processes to ensure that they comply with food standards;these processes may involve the use of chemicals, especially those for thepurpose of killing ‘germs’.The Codex report includes an extract from the Statutes of the Codex AlimentariusCommission that lists the purposes of the Codex food standards, the first ofwhich is,> “protecting the health of consumers and ensuring fair practices in the food> trade.”The idea that Codex food standards fulfil the purpose of protecting consumerhealth is supported by the claim in the Codex report that,> “For more than five decades Codex texts have contributed immensely to the> safety and quality of the food we eat.”This claim is misleading. The scientific establishment has revised the meaningsof the terms ‘safety’ and ‘quality’ to ensure that they conform to criteria setby ‘risk assessment’ evaluations. The discussion about chemicals earlier in thischapter referred to the 1999 article by environmentalist Peter Montague, whostated that ‘risk assessment’ is not a science, but involves a great deal ofjudgement, which is how the word ‘safe’ has become a relative term, rather thanan absolute one.The CAC, previously stated, is a collaboration of the FAO and WHO. The WHO webpage entitled International Food Standards (FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius) statesthat,> “FAO and WHO work on the provision of independent international scientific> advice on microbiological and chemical hazards.”As demonstrated throughout this book, the WHO, the leading health ‘authority’within the medical establishment, operates from the basis of fundamentallyflawed theories; particularly, the ‘germ theory’ and the idea that a substanceis only a poison with reference to the quantity used. Nevertheless, thesetheories, flawed though they are, are used to determine the safety of food. Withrespect to ‘microbiological hazards’, the word safe means ‘free from germs’;whereas, with respect to ‘chemical hazards’, the word safe means that thequantity used does not exceed the level at which an adverse effect may beobserved.It is the aim of the CAC to ‘harmonise’ all food standards in all countries sothat they conform to those of Codex Alimentarius, because, as the Codex reportstates,> “Food regulations in different countries are often conflicting and> contradictory.”It is claimed in the Codex report that these differences create barriers totrade, and that harmonisation of standards would reduce or eliminate thosebarriers and thus enable ‘fair practices’ in the food trade. In reality, theharmonisation of food standards and the removal of trade barriers will mainlyserve the interests of the large food manufacturers that dominate the foodindustry. The harmonisation of food regulations in conformity with Codexstandards would not ensure the safety of food products, nor would they protectthe health of consumers.The food standards set by the CAC include a number of codes of practice thatgovern various aspects of food production; one of these relates to hygiene andstates that,> “In almost all cases it is required that the product shall be free from> pathogenic microorganisms, toxins or other poisonous or deleterious substances> in amounts that represent a hazard to health.”There are a number of joint FAO/WHO ‘expert’ groups that address specificaspects of the food industry; one of these groups is JEMRA (Joint FAO/WHO ExpertMeetings on Microbiological Risk Assessment). This group was founded in 2000 forthe stated purpose as described in the Codex report,> “JEMRA aims to optimize the use of microbiological risk assessment as the> scientific basis for risk management decisions that address microbiological> hazards in foods.”The work of JEMRA is clearly based on the flawed idea that it is the ‘microbes’that poison foods, rather than any toxic chemicals used in their manufacture.The Codex standard that relates to food contaminants, entitled General Standardfor Contaminants and Toxins in Food and Feed (Codex STAN 193-1995), is clearlybased on the Paracelsus fallacy. This standard provides information about therecommended maximum limits (MLs) for a variety of contaminants to ensure thatany exposure to them is as low as possible. The principles for setting MLsinclude a number of criteria, the first of which states,> “MLs should be set only for those contaminants that present both a significant> risk to public health and a known or expected problem in international trade.”This criterion demonstrates the equal status afforded to public health andinternational trade, as also demonstrated by the first purpose of Codex foodstandards listed in the CAC Statutes previously referred to. However, there arecircumstances that create conflicts between practices that would benefit thefood industry and those that would benefit consumers; in the event of suchconflicts it is invariably the interests of the food industry that are givenpriority. Furthermore, the Codex report would seem to suggest that thecontamination of food is a normal occurrence by the statement that,> “Everything that finds its way into food, if not used correctly, can be> dangerous.”The examples cited by the report include food additives, pesticide residues andveterinary drugs. The most significant veterinary drugs are antibiotics, thedangers of which have been discussed; however, there are potential hazards fromresidues of all types of veterinary drugs. Pesticides have been discussed atlength, although it is important to reiterate that pesticide residues can alsoaffect food crops used as ingredients of processed food products. Pesticideresidues are governed by a separate FAO/WHO ‘expert’ group called JMPR (JointMeeting on Pesticide Residues).The measures introduced by many of the original food laws also included therequirement to provide ‘honest’ information about the food to preventdeceptions, such as the sale of bad milk as ‘cream’; honest labelling remains akey feature within food regulations. The Codex standard that regulates foodlabelling is General Standard for the Labelling of Prepackaged Foods (Codex STAN1-1985) which, under the heading General Principles, states,> “Prepackaged food shall not be described or presented on any label or in any> labelling in a manner that is false, misleading or deceptive or is likely to> create an erroneous impression regarding its character in any respect.”The Codex labelling standard not only regulates the manner in which prepackagedfoods must not be described on the labels, it also stipulates the ingredientsthat must be declared on them. There is, however, a provision that relates toingredients that do not require a declaration on a food label; this provisionstates,> “Where a compound ingredient (for which a name has been established in a Codex> standard or in national legislation) constitutes less than 5% of the food, the> ingredients, other than food additives which serve a technological function in> the finished product, need not be declared.”It may be argued that a requirement to declare every single ingredient wouldresult in an unwieldy label; whilst this may be true, the counter argument isfar stronger. This argument maintains that the granting of exclusions forcertain ingredients results in food products that can, and invariably will,contain ingredients of which the consumer is unaware. The absence of informationabout all ingredients of a product means that consumers can be misled about thenature of the prepackaged food products they buy; a situation that clearlycontravenes the Codex standard that food labels should not be misleading.Exclusions can also be exploited to enable food manufacturers to use substancesas ingredients that, were they declared on the label, may discourage customersfrom purchasing the product. One example is that, under certain conditions,foods are permitted to contain ingredients made with MSG without that fact beingdeclared on the label; MSG is discussed later in this chapter.The Codex standards generally recognise that foods should contain nutrients,although this is another word that has been assigned a revised meaning, asindicated by the Codex report that states,> “Numerous experts tell us which nutrients are good for us and which are not> and we need to know what is in a food in order to compose a healthy diet.”The idea that a nutrient might not be ‘good for us’ indicates a very poor levelof understanding about nutrition. A nutrient, by definition is ‘good for us’;conversely a substance that is not ‘good for us’ cannot be a nutrient.The Codex standard that governs information about nutrients to be declared onfood labels is entitled Guidelines on Nutrition Labelling (CAC/GL 2-1985), thepurpose of this information includes,> “...providing the consumer with information about a food so that a wise choice> of food can be made...”Consumers can only make a ‘wise choice’ if they have all of the necessaryinformation to do so. Unfortunately, the medical establishment, which includesthe WHO, does not understand nutrition, and is therefore unable to provide allof the required information so that consumers can be ‘well-informed’ and able tomake ‘wise choices’ about their food purchases. Instead, they promulgateconfusing and misleading information, as indicated by the Guidelines onNutrition Labelling that incorrectly defines a nutrient as,> “...any substance normally consumed as a constituent of food...”The guideline expands on this basic statement with reference to three categoriesof ‘substances’ that they refer to as ‘nutrients’. The first category refers toany substance that ‘provides energy’; however, energy is not a measure ofnutrition. The second refers to substances that are needed for the maintenanceof life. The third refers to substances a deficiency of which would produceadverse effects. It should be clear that the second and third categories areinterconnected and represent the real meaning of ‘nutrient’.Although it is clear that the CAC recognises nutrients as important for themaintenance of life, it limits the ability to make claims about the relationshipbetween food and health; as demonstrated by the Codex standard entitledGuidelines for Use of Nutrition Claims (CAC/GL 23-1997) that defines a nutritionclaim as,> “...any representation which states, suggests or implies that a food has> particular nutritional properties…”This statement is anomalous. The sole purpose of food is to provide the bodywith nutrients; therefore, nutrition claims can be made about all foods, which,by definition, have nutritional properties. It would seem, however, that thepurpose of this standard is to refute claims that certain foods have specifichealth benefits, but this too is misleading. Unfortunately, the problem isexacerbated by the limited information permitted by the guidelines with respectto ‘nutrition claims’ and ‘nutrients’,> “The only nutrition claims permitted shall be those relating to energy,> protein, carbohydrate and fat and components thereof, fibre, sodium and> vitamins and minerals for which Nutrient Reference Values (NRVs) have been> laid down in the Codex Guidelines for Nutrition Labelling.”A genuinely healthy diet will include a variety of foods that each containvarious nutrients, including vitamins and minerals. Food labels that claim toprovide ‘nutritional information’ list carbohydrates, fats, proteins and otherpermitted ‘nutrients’ in the food; but this does not provide consumers withuseful information about the real nutritional value of the product. Nutrition isdiscussed in detail in chapter ten, but there are two important points withreference to this discussion; these are: that nutrients should not be evaluatedindividually; and that processing and storage reduce the nutritional content offoods.Different countries are likely to have different regulations that govern theinformation provided on food labels, but the increasingly ‘international’ natureof the food industry means that manufactured food products will usually containthe information referred to in this discussion.In addition to ‘nutritional’ information, labels are required to provide detailsof the product’s ingredients; the Codex labelling standard Codex STAN 1-1985defines an ingredient as,> “...any substance, including a food additive, used in the manufacture or> preparation of a food and present in the final product although possibly in a> modified form.”The standard states that certain foods and ingredients must be declared on thelabel, especially those, such as peanuts, that have been identified to causehypersensitivity; ‘peanut allergies’ are discussed in chapter seven.It is a recognised phenomenon that food product labels often contain a list ofunfamiliar and often unpronounceable ingredients; these are almost invariablychemical compounds used as food additives to perform specific ‘technologicalfunctions’. It is claimed that consumers are able to make ‘wise choices’ aboutfood products based on information provided on the label, but the increasing useof synthetic chemicals means that only people with an extensive knowledge ofchemistry are in a position to decipher the labels and understand theingredients of the food products they buy.It is clear that the food industry does not serve the interests of consumers;this can be demonstrated by a number of factors, which are: the failure tounderstand the real purpose of food; the poor level of knowledge aboutnutrition; the utilisation of synthetic chemicals; and the prioritisation oftrade and profits. The food industry is clearly aided and abetted by theinternational ‘expert’ groups responsible for the creation of the foodregulations that govern the production of processed food products.People are encouraged to believe that these manufactured food products fulfilthe function of food and provide them with all the nutrients their bodiesrequire; but this is not the case; the emphasis on calories also adds to theconfusion.People are also encouraged to believe that these products are entirely ‘safe’;but this is another mistaken belief. Most, if not all, manufactured foodproducts contain a variety of chemical ‘additives’ that not only adulterate thefoods, but also poison them; a situation that is summarised succinctly by PaulStitt, who stated in his 1982 book that,> “Processed foods are terrible things for your body for two reasons – they are> stripped of their nutrient value in the refining process, and they are> poisoned with sugar and other harmful additives.”This situation has not improved in the intervening decades since the 1980s, asthe following discussions about a variety of food additives will demonstrate.Food AdditivesThe EFSA web page entitled Food Additives provides an overview of the purpose ofthese substances in manufactured food products,> “Food additives are substances added intentionally to foodstuffs to perform> certain technological functions, for example to colour, to sweeten or to help> preserve foods.”The Codex standard that governs food additives is the General Standard for FoodAdditives Codex STAN 192-1995 (GSFA), which is clearly intended to be regardedas the definitive guidance for all food manufacturers, as indicated by thestatement that,> “The General Standard for Food Additives (GSFA) should be the single> authoritative reference point for food additives.”The intended ‘authority’ of this standard, which will be referred to as theGSFA, is further demonstrated by the statement that,> “Only the food additives listed herein are recognized as suitable for use in> foods in conformance with the provisions of this Standard.”Although originally adopted in 1995, the GSFA has been regularly revised; it isthe 2016 version that is used as the source of references cited in the followingdiscussions. The term ‘food additive’ is defined in the GSFA as follows,> “Food additive means any substance not normally consumed as a food by itself> and not normally used as a typical ingredient of the food, whether or not it> has nutritive value...”The efforts of the 19th century food safety campaigners generated legislationthat was claimed to prevent food adulteration. However, the permission grantedfor the use of substances that are ‘not normally consumed as food’ means thatthe GSFA provides official approval for the adulteration of food.The rapid growth of the food industry and the increased manufacture of processedfood products have inevitably resulted in the increased manufacture of foodadditives for use in those products. Paul Stitt estimated in his 1982 book thatthe average American consumed almost 10 pounds of approximately 2,000 foodadditives each year. But the consumption of a large quantity of food additivesis not exclusive to the ‘average American’; every person whose diet includesmanufactured processed food and drink products will consume a variety of foodadditives.The GSFA explains the conditions that are claimed to warrant the use of foodadditives under the sub-heading Justification for the Use of Additives,> “The use of additives is justified only when such use has an advantage, does> not present an appreciable health risk to consumers, does not mislead the> consumer, and serves one or more of the technological functions set out by> Codex...”One of the justifications for the use of food additives is claimed to be,> “To preserve the nutritional quality of the food.”Any food additive that preserves the nutritional quality of a food to which itis added must, by definition, be a nutrient. It should be obvious therefore,that food additives that do not have ‘nutritive value’ cannot preserve thenutritional quality of the food; and that such substances will in fact diminishthe nutritional quality of the food.Another justification for the use of food additives is stated in the GSFA to be,> “To provide aids in the manufacture, processing, preparation, treatment,> packing, transport or storage of food...”All of these processes diminish the overall quality of fresh foods that havebeen used as ingredients. The main purpose of food additives is, therefore, toartificially replace the qualities of fresh food ingredients lost due tomanufacturing processes. But the idea that synthetic chemical compounds arecapable of replacing lost qualities is mistaken; the resulting processed foodproduct that is laden with food additives is of a decidedly inferior quality. ASeptember 2007 press release article entitled Crackdown on additives needed onthe website of The Food Commission explains the basic problem,"},{"pageContent":"> “Artificial colourings, along with high levels of sugar and/or artificial> sweeteners, flavouring and flavour enhancers, are frequently used to encourage> the consumption of highly processed foods which are typically high in calories> but low in other essential nutrients.”This press release was issued after the publication of a study that haddiscovered some adverse health effects caused by food colouring agents, whichare discussed in the next section.JECFA (Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives) is another ‘expert’group, which, as its name implies, is responsible for the evaluation of foodadditives. It may be assumed that this responsibility includes efforts to ensurethat food additives are ‘safe’, but this is not the case. However, the conceptof ‘safety’ is not ignored; it is discussed in the GSFA under the sub-headingFood Additive Safety,> “Only food additives shall be endorsed and included in this standard that, so> far as can be judged on the evidence presently available from JECFA, present> no appreciable health risk to consumers at the use levels proposed.”The phrases ‘so far as can be judged’, ‘no appreciable health risk’ and ‘at theuse levels proposed’ ought to raise serious concerns; these phrases indicatethat ‘safety’ can only be assured under certain conditions. But thisinterpretation does not represent the real meaning of the word ‘safe’, which isdefined as the absence of risk. In its true meaning, the word ‘safe’ is not arelative term; true safety cannot be dependent on the existence of certainconditions. The CAC does not use the term in its true meaning but has re-definedit as a relative term with respect to food additives; as indicated by the GSFA,which uses the phrase ‘determined to be safe’ that is defined to mean,> “...that the use of a food additive does not pose a safety concern under> conditions of use described by JECFA as being of no toxicological concern...”The phrases used by the GSFA demonstrate the powerful influence of theParacelsus fallacy and the reliance on ‘risk assessment’, both of which havebeen shown to be unsuitable theories and methods on which to base genuine food‘safety’.The determination of the use levels of food additives that pose ‘no appreciablehealth risk’ involves experimental animal feeding studies, which, like allanimal testing procedures, are fundamentally problematic, as discussed. Theresults obtained from these animal studies are nevertheless used to generate theNOAEL, which is incorporated into an ADI (Acceptable Daily Intake) that isdefined within the GSFA as,> “...an estimate by JECFA of the amount of a food additive, expressed on a body> weight basis that can be ingested daily over a lifetime without appreciable> health risk.”One of the footnotes in the GSFA that relates to this definition indicates thatthe phrase ‘without appreciable health risk’ means,> “...that there is a reasonable certainty of no harm to consumers if an> additive is used at levels that do not exceed those in this Standard.”The ADI for each additive is set after a large safety margin has been factoredinto the calculations; this safety margin is deemed sufficiently large to allowfor the consumption of any amount of that additive. The GSFA also includesreference to the maximum use levels for food additives and states that,> “The primary objective of establishing maximum use levels for food additives> in various food groups is to ensure that the intake of an additive from all> its uses does not exceed its ADI.”The maximum use level of an additive is defined as,> “...the highest concentration of the additive determined to be functionally> effective in a food or food category and agreed to be safe by the Codex> Alimentarius Commission.”Although the calculations incorporate large safety margins, this does notprovide an absolute confirmation that an additive is ‘safe’, despite the claimthat it has been ‘agreed to be safe’ by the CAC.One of the main problems arising from the procedures used to determine ‘safe uselevels’ is that, as for virtually all chemicals, safety testing procedures areconducted almost entirely on each individual substance. Although studies may beconducted to test some combinations of food additives, these are generallylimited in range, and are mostly conducted after the substances have beenintroduced into the foods additives market and incorporated into food productsto be consumed by the public.None of the assessments involves an evaluation of the effects of varyingcombinations of the thousands of chemical food additives used in allmanufactured processed food products; nor do they evaluate the effects ofexposures to the mix of chemical food additives in combination with chemicalsused in other products. More importantly, the tests that are conducted are basedon the assumption that humans are alike and will therefore all react in exactlythe same way to food additives; this is, however, yet another mistakenassumption.Although some chemicals are known to interact synergistically, this is a poorlytested phenomenon. The failure to test all combinations of all chemicals used asfood additives means that any synergies that do occur remain unidentified;assurances of ‘safety’ cannot be relied upon. Furthermore, many of the chemicalsused to create food additives are derived from petrochemicals; which means thatthey are inherently toxic and consequently entirely unsuitable for use in foodproducts intended for human consumption.It is important to note that JECFA does not conduct studies; at their meetings,the Committee assesses various studies, published papers and other relevantdocumentation made available to them, from which they make their evaluationsabout the substances under review. These evaluations are incorporated into therelevant Codex standard; they are also published as reports and made availableon the website of the WHO as part of their Technical series. This means that theCommittee should be aware of the latest results from scientific studies thathave investigated food additives. However, some food additives continue to bepermitted for use by JECFA, despite the fact that published scientific studieshave demonstrated the existence of adverse health effects that have occurred dueto the consumption of these substances.The role of JECFA has been expanded to also include risk assessments and safetyevaluations of contaminants, natural toxins and residues of veterinary drugs inanimal products. The results of these evaluations are incorporated into CodexStandard STAN 193-1995, as discussed in the previous section. The FAO websiteprovides an overview of the expanded role of JECFA under the heading Chemicalrisks and JECFA,> “The Committee has also developed principles for safety assessment of> chemicals in foods that are consistent with current thinking on risk> assessment and take account of developments in toxicology and other relevant> sciences.”The purpose of the November 2016 meeting of JECFA in Rome was to evaluate six‘contaminants’ in foods, one of which is a group of substances called‘aflatoxins’; which are described in the report from that meeting as,> “...one of the most potent mutagenic and carcinogenic substances known...”Aflatoxins are said to be produced by two types of the Aspergillus fungus. Thereare a few crops that are reported to be particularly susceptible to aflatoxins;they include corn, peanuts and cotton, all three of which are acknowledged toreceive some of the heaviest applications of pesticides, herbicides andfungicides. A heavy application of fungicide should, however, prevent the growthof any fungus; which raises the question of what is the real source of these‘potent’ toxins that are claimed to be produced by the Aspergillus fungus.The fact that these crops become ‘toxic’ in the presence of toxic pesticidesshould not be surprising; there is no need to invoke the existence of aso-called ‘toxic fungus’ to be able to explain the consequences of theapplication of toxic chemicals onto these crops. The discussion in chapter threedemonstrated that most fungi, if not all of them, are harmless and that many ofthem are, in fact, beneficial. An important point to note is that an associationhas been identified between ‘aflatoxin exposure’ and liver cancer. As will befurther discussed in chapter seven, cancer is mostly associated with, althoughnot exclusively caused by, exposures to toxic substances; it should beemphasised that the liver is the body’s main detoxification organ.The reason for referring to aflatoxins in a discussion about food additives isto demonstrate the errors of the medical establishment, especially the adherenceto the ‘germ theory’ in order to blame ‘germs’ for problems that are, inreality, caused by toxic chemicals. Their failure to properly acknowledge therole of toxic chemicals continues to influence regulations that claim to ensurethe ‘safety’ of food. The WHO permits the use of toxic chemicals to kill‘germs’, but claims that these toxic substances do not pose human health risksprovided that they are used at the appropriate ‘dose’.The efforts to achieve a global harmonisation of food regulations have resultedin a certain level of success, although regional differences remain and theseare discussed in an April 2013 article entitled Review of the regulation andsafety assessment of food substances in various countries and jurisdictions. Thecountries and jurisdictions included in the review were Argentina, Australia,Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand and theUnited States. The ‘food substances’ considered by the review article include,> “...direct food additives, food ingredients, flavouring agents, food enzymes> and/or processing aids, food contact materials, novel foods, and nanoscale> materials for food applications.”All of these ‘food substances’, with the sole exception of any real foodingredients, can be regarded as falling under the generic label of ‘foodadditives’ for the purposes of this discussion and the ensuing sections thatdiscuss a few significant types of additive. The article recognises theexistence of variations in the different regulatory frameworks that govern theapproval of food additives within each country, but also recognises that therewere similarities,> “...including the use of positive lists of approved substances.”The reference in the article to ‘approved substances’, and to JECFA evaluationsof the safety of food additives, is a clear indication that the GSFA isincreasingly recognised by the scientific community as the authoritativeguidance for food additives.There is, however, one aspect of US food regulations that is unique. This is theability to categorise substances as GRAS (generally recognised as safe); acategory that was created by the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 to enablecommonly-used food ingredients to be exempted from the usual FDA approvalprocess. However, this legislation inadvertently created a loophole, which hasbeen exploited by some food manufacturers to claim GRAS status for new chemicalsthat are not common food ingredients. The consequence of this loophole wasexposed by the NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council) in an April 2014 reportentitled Generally Recognized as Secret: Chemicals Added to Food in the UnitedStates. On a web page with the same title, the NRDC states that,> “The exemption allows manufacturers to make safety determinations that the> uses of their newest chemicals in food are safe without notifying the FDA.”This means that manufacturers can claim an exemption under GRAS for certainchemicals; this situation parallels that of fracking companies that arepermitted to make a claim of ‘proprietary information’ for the chemical productsthey use in their operations, as previously discussed. The problem is not merelythat food manufacturers fail to notify the FDA; the salient point is that thepublic remains ignorant about the inclusion of these chemicals in the foodproducts they buy, as explained by the NRDC in the Conclusion to their report,> “A chemical additive cannot be ‘generally recognized as safe’ if its identity,> chemical composition and safety determination are not publicly disclosed.”In view of the efforts towards the harmonisation of standards and theincreasingly global nature of the food industry, the question arises therefore,as to whether harmonisation will eliminate the GRAS category in the US orwhether ‘GRAS’ will become the ‘authoritative guideline’ for all othercountries; at the time of writing, this question had yet to be resolved.It is clear that the standards and regulations that govern the manufacture offood products and their permissible ingredients do not preserve the purity,safety or nutritional content of food. On the contrary, the regulations thatclaim to protect the integrity of food, in reality, permit the use of a varietyof chemical compounds under the label ‘food additives’, none of which has beenproven to be absolutely safe to consume.Furthermore, additives are used in multiple combinations in a wide variety ofmanufactured, processed food products; but there is no evidence that thesecombinations of food additives have ever been tested to determine their safety,or to assess any adverse health effects that may arise from their consumption.The WHO acknowledges that there are some risks posed by some chemicals, asdemonstrated on their web pages relating to the topic of Food Safety thatinclude a page entitled Chemical risks, which states,> “Chemicals can end up in food either intentionally added for a technological> purpose (e.g. food additives), or through environmental pollution of the air,> water and soil.”This is a clear acknowledgement that ‘chemicals’ can be defined as environmentalpollutants; although it is highly unlikely that the WHO intended this statementto be a confirmation that the chemicals used as food additives are toxic andtherefore environmental pollutants; nevertheless, this is the case, as theensuing discussions will demonstrate.It should be noted that food additives are used to serve ‘technologicalfunctions’ and that most of them are purely cosmetic; this is particularly thecase with respect to the use of chemicals to add colour to foods.Food ColouringThe visual appeal of a food is important; it depends, at least to a certainextent, upon the food’s colour. In order to make them visually appealing, foodmanufacturers must therefore create products that present foods in the colourswith which they are normally associated.Unfortunately, most natural foods, especially fruits and vegetables, lose someof their brightness of colour when they undergo any form of processing,including home cooking. The loss of colour is, however, more pronounced whenfoods undergo manufacturing processes, but the food industry compensates forthis problem in a number of ways, one of which is through the use of ‘foodcolourings’, the purpose of which is explained by First Steps Nutrition Trust onthe web page entitled Additives, which states that,> “They are used solely as cosmetic additives to boost the consumer appeal of> products, for example by adding brightness lost in processing or storage,> mimicking the colour profile of healthier ingredients such as fruits and> vegetables, or overcoming colour variations that occur in natural products.”The use of certain natural materials to add colour to foods has a long history.Saffron, the name given to the dried stigmas of the plant Crocus Sativus, is aspice known for its ability to impart a yellow colour to food. However, saffroncontains nutrients; which means that it is a ‘food’ as well as a food colouringagent.By comparison, the synthetic chemical compounds used to impart colour toprocessed food products are entirely different substances. As previouslydiscussed, Friedrich Accum’s investigations discovered that chemicals had beenused to enhance the colour of certain foods; for example, copper was used to dyepickles green and lead was used to dye sweets red. Although ‘natural’, copperand lead are both highly toxic and should not have been added to foods.The rise of the chemical industry, and particularly the petrochemical industry,resulted in the manufacture of chemical compounds that were found to be usefulas dyes. In 2010, CSPI (Center for Science in the Public Interest) published areport entitled Food Dyes: A Rainbow of Risks, which explains,> “Dyes are complex organic chemicals that were originally derived from coal> tar, but now from petroleum.”These dyes were initially created for the textile industry, but wereinexplicably deemed useful for the food industry; although it should be notedthat petrochemical-derived compounds were also deemed useful for thepharmaceutical industry. However, petrochemicals are inherently toxic; whichmeans that, like copper and lead, they are entirely unsuitable substances to beadded to food.Despite the efforts of the CAC to ensure that the GSFA is the sole ‘authority’with respect to food additives, there are still some variations within differentcountries. The CSPI is based in the US; their report therefore focuses on thesituation in that country, where the consumption of food dyes is reported tohave increased five-fold since the mid-20th century. However, certain food dyesthat are permitted in the US have been withdrawn from use in other countries,and some have even been banned.As discussed in the previous section, the GSFA states that the use of foodadditives is justified when there is an advantage; the CSPI report describessome of those ‘advantages’, which are clearly of the kind that benefit the foodindustry rather than the consumer,> “Companies like using them because they are cheaper, more stable, and brighter> than most natural colourings.”These advantages do not ensure that chemical dyes are ‘safe’ for use in foods.Further confirmation that these dyes are neither safe nor suitable forconsumption is provided in the report, which states that,> “It is worth noting that dyes are not pure chemicals, but may contain upwards> of 10 percent impurities that are in the chemicals from which dyes are made or> develop in the manufacturing process.”These impurities are ‘permitted’ by the FDA with the proviso that they do notexceed a specified concentration; however, these contaminants may include somehighly dangerous substances, such as benzene, lead, mercury and arsenic, to namejust a few. Nevertheless, chemical dyes are used to brightly colour a widevariety of ‘food products’, many of which are intended to appeal to and beconsumed by children.Despite the claim that food colouring additives have been assessed and shown tobe ‘safe’, a wealth of scientific evidence shows this not to be the case. Thisevidence, which has accumulated since the 1970s, demonstrates the existence of aclear association between adverse health effects and the consumption of fooddyes. These adverse effects, which are more pronounced in children, are mainlybehavioural; as indicated by a January 2016 CSPI article entitled Fact Sheet:The Science Linking Food Dyes with Impacts on Children’s Behavior that states,> “Over the past 40 years, many double-blind studies have concluded that food> dyes and other ingredients can impair behavior in some children.”The UK establishment also acknowledges that there is at least a potentialproblem associated with the consumption of chemical food dyes. A September 2007University of Southampton news release entitled Major study indicates a linkbetween hyperactivity in children and certain food additives states that,> “A study by researchers at the University of Southampton has shown evidence of> increased levels of hyperactivity in young children consuming mixtures of some> artificial food colours and the preservative sodium benzoate.”The food colours include tartrazine, quinoline yellow and allura red, all ofwhich are commonly found in drinks, confectionery and bakery goods, as well as anumber of other ‘food products’, and all of which are derived frompetrochemicals.The food dye coding systems vary according to country or region; the EU foodadditive numbering system classifies tartrazine as E102, quinoline yellow asE104 and allura red as E129. In the US, tartrazine is classified as FD&C Yellow5 and allura red as FD&C Red 40. Quinoline yellow is not recognised by the USdye codes, but is claimed to be ‘structurally equivalent’ to FD&C Yellow 10,which is approved for use in the US in medicines and cosmetics, although it isnot approved for use in foods.The inherent toxicity of these food dyes can be demonstrated by the example ofallura red. This dye is a derivative of naphthalene, which is an aromatichydrocarbon that is used in insecticides and pest repellents; it is alsocommonly used in mothballs. It should be obvious that these applicationsindicate that naphthalene is toxic; evidence of its toxicity is shown by theclassification of naphthalene as a Group C carcinogen; which means that it isregarded as a ‘possible’ cause of cancer; it is clearly not ‘safe’.The significance of the Southampton University study results was that adversehealth effects were discovered to be caused by the combination of certainchemical food dyes and a certain chemical preservative. This findingdemonstrates that chemical reactions can occur between different types of foodadditives and indicates the existence of chemical synergies that can produce amore intense adverse reaction.These results demonstrate the consequences of safety testing procedures thatonly investigate individual food additive compounds, and therefore fail to studythe effects of the many combinations of chemical additives that are commonlyused in food products. This point is further demonstrated by the CSPI Food Dyesreport that discusses nine food dyes, three of which account for approximately90 per cent of all food dyes used in the US; the report refers to the studiesthat had been conducted to determine their safety and states that,> “...virtually all the studies tested individual dyes, whereas many foods and> diets contain mixtures of dyes (and other ingredients) that might lead to> additive or synergistic effects.”Although referred to as food dyes, these chemical compounds are also used inother products, as explained in the 2016 CSPI report entitled Seeing Red: Timefor Action on Food Dyes, which states that,> “Most of the dyes used in food are also permitted to be used in other products> such as cosmetics, personal-care products like mouthwash, shampoo and> toothpaste; over-the-counter medications; dietary supplements; and> prescription drugs.”The safety studies that only test individual food dyes, and only considerexposures from their use in food, clearly fail to take account of multipleexposures to chemical dyes in all of the other products in which they are used,especially personal care products used on a daily basis; personal care productsare discussed in more detail later in this chapter. As frequently stated, it isnot the dose that makes a substance a poison; the significant point is that thegreater the exposure to a toxic substance, or a combination of toxic substances,the greater will be the adverse effects.One of the dyes used in products other than foods is quinoline yellow. A January2015 article entitled The cosmetic dye quinoline yellow causes DNA damage invitro reports the finding indicated by its title; the abstract of the articlestates that,> “Our findings suggest that this colorant could cause harmful effects to humans> if it is metabolized or absorbed through the skin.”Unfortunately, JECFA does not seem to be aware of this finding because theirNovember 2016 report, entitled Evaluation of certain food additives, includes anassessment of quinoline yellow that resulted in the establishment of an ADI forthis substance. The evaluation states that,> “The Committee concluded that dietary exposure to Quinoline Yellow for> children and all other age groups does not present a health concern.”The Southampton study result indicated that the children were not all affectedto the same extent from their consumption of the combined food additives. Thissituation is convenient for the establishment, as it enables them to claim thatan association between the effects and the food dye has not been definitivelyestablished; as can be discerned from the NHS web page entitled Food colours andhyperactivity that states,> “the link between food colours and hyperactivity isn’t completely certain...”The real reasons that people experience different reactions are explained inchapter ten.However, the injection of ‘uncertainty’ into the debate about the safety of fooddyes, means that parents remain in doubt about the effects that may occur iftheir children consume processed food products and drinks. This uncertaintyhides the more fundamental point, which is that these food dyes are made fromtoxic chemicals and should not be consumed at all.It is claimed that large safety margins are factored into the calculations ofcriteria such as the ADI to allow for significant levels of exposure to eachfood dye. However, the estimates used in JECFA evaluations are based onconsumption by an ‘average healthy adult’, yet many of the brightly-colouredfood products are specifically intended for consumption by children, who areobviously not ‘average healthy adults’.Another very significant group of products in which food dyes are used are‘medicines’; as indicated by the 2016 CSPI Seeing Red report. Furthermore, theAction on Additives web page entitled Colourings indicates that sodium benzoate,the preservative implicated by the Southampton University study, is also used in‘medicines’ which,> “...contain colourings withdrawn from food and drink because of risks to> hyperactivity and ADHD in children.”It is astounding that the medical establishment permits the use in ‘medicines’of food additives that have been withdrawn from use in foods and drinks due toadverse health effects. This is yet another contradiction of the notion that‘medicines’ are suitable for the treatment of ill-health.The UK NHS web page about food colours recommends that certain food dyes shouldbe avoided by children who are hyperactive and lists six dyes that arerecommended to be avoided. These six dyes are exactly the same as those assessedin the Southampton University study; in other words, these are the six food dyesthat have been found to be associated with adverse health effects. Yet the NHSclaims the association is not completely certain.Ritalin is one of the ‘medicines’ that contain food dyes withdrawn from use infoods and drinks due to their association with hyperactivity and behaviouralproblems. Yet this drug is commonly prescribed for children diagnosed with‘behavioural’ conditions such as ADD and ADHD. In other words, these childrenare treated with medicines that contain chemicals shown to induce the verysymptoms for which they are being treated.Petrochemical-based food dyes clearly pose demonstrable health risks forconsumers, especially children; these risks far outweigh the ‘advantages’ gainedby the food industry in the manufacture of food products that arebrightly-coloured in order to be visually appealing to consumers.Food FlavouringThe visual appeal of a food product may inspire its purchase, but foods mustappeal to other senses when they are consumed; in other words, they must have apleasant aroma and an enjoyable flavour. Food manufacturers must thereforeensure that their products appeal to all three of these senses, but especiallyto the sense of taste.Unfortunately, food manufacturing processes adversely affect the flavour andaroma of fresh food ingredients as well as their colour; but these problems areresolved in virtually the same manner. Food flavours and aromas lost due toprocessing are replaced mainly by a variety of chemical compounds collectivelyknown as ‘flavourings’; as indicated on the Additives page on the First StepsNutrition Trust website,> “Flavourings are mainly used as cosmetic additives in foods, drinks, medicines> and vitamins to provide taste and aroma sensations that the basic ingredients> are not able to provide on their own.”In 2012, First Steps Nutrition Trust published a detailed report entitled AQuestion of Taste: A Review of flavourings in foods and drinks in the UK.Although this report refers to the situation in the UK, much of the informationit contains applies to a wide range of flavourings used in many food productsthat are sold and consumed around the world. This report is the source of anumber of references quoted in this discussion, in which it will be referred toas the Review.Herbs and spices have been used to add flavour to foods for millennia; spices,for example, are mainly native to Asia and the Middle East, but the expansion ofthe spice trade enabled their introduction into other regions of the world.Herbs and spices are still significant commodities; they are sold directly tothe public for domestic use as well as to the food industry for use asflavourings in food products.The growth of the food industry during the latter part of the 20th century ledto the manufacture of an increasingly varied range of food products that neededto have an equally varied range of flavours. This need inspired the developmentof a new branch of the food additives industry that was dedicated to thecreation of ‘flavourings’. The scientists in the ‘flavourings industry’ arereferred to as ‘flavourists’ or as ‘flavour chemists’ and their work isprimarily conducted in laboratories. According to the Review, the flavouringsindustry constitutes the largest sector of the huge global food additivesindustry. The flavourings produced by this industry perform a variety offunctions; as indicated by the Review, which states that they are used,> “...in order to alter the taste profile of the basic ingredients of the> product, to flavour tasteless base materials, to mask ‘off-notes’, to boost> flavour after food processing, to enhance flavours present, or for reasons of> economy, as flavourings are generally cheaper than flavourful base> ingredients.”In common with food colourings, food flavourings are also claimed to be ‘safe’;as demonstrated by the EFSA web page entitled Flavourings which states that,> “Flavourings have a long history of safe use in a wide variety of foods...”The word ‘safe’ is again used in its revised context as a relative term; inother words, flavourings are ‘safe’ on the proviso that they meet certainconditions, as demonstrated by the further EFSA comment that,> “They are used in comparatively small amounts so that consumer exposure is> relatively low.”The use of a ‘small amount’ of a flavouring does not render it ‘safe’ forconsumption; the need to ensure a low level of ‘consumer exposure’ clearlyindicates that these substances pose a potential, if not a genuine health hazardif used in larger amounts. Another reason for using a ‘small amount’ of aflavouring substance is explained in the Review,> “Flavourings can be potent and may be needed in very small quantities...”Some natural flavourings, such as spices, are also potent and only needed insmall quantities, but this is due to the intensity of their flavour, not to thepossibility that they pose a potential health hazard if consumer exposure is notkept to a low level. It should be clear that spices and chemical flavourings arefundamentally different; unprocessed spices that contain nutrients are foods,whereas all chemical flavourings are devoid of nutrients and are therefore notfoods.Although flavourings are a type of food additive, and therefore governed by theGSFA, they are also governed by a Codex standard that is specific toflavourings. This standard, reference number CAC/GL 66-2008, is entitledGuidelines for the Use of Flavourings; its purpose is stated to be to provide,> “...principles for the safe use of the components of flavourings...”The ‘safety’ of these flavourings, as with all food additives, is based onevaluations conducted by JECFA that have determined that these compounds,> “…present no safety concern at estimated levels of intake…”However, a significant property that chemical flavourings have in common withchemical food dyes is the basic type of chemicals from which many of them arederived; as the Review explains,> “Petrochemicals are the most common source materials for flavourings in the> category ‘flavouring substances’...”Unlike food dyes, food flavourings were not originally created for use inanother type of industry; however, the ‘flavourings industry’ supplies chemicalcompounds to industries other than the food industry; the Review explains,> “Most companies that supply flavourings to the food and drink industry also> supply fragrances for use in non-comestible products like perfumes, cosmetics,> toiletries and household cleaning products.”A number of ‘non-comestible’ products are discussed in more detail later in thischapter.It is a known phenomenon that there is a close association between the sense oftaste and the sense of smell; many natural materials that impart flavour tofoods also impart a distinctive aroma. It is therefore unsurprising that certainmaterials, including fruits and other parts of plants, are used as fragrancesfor non-food products; ‘lemon’, for example, is a common fragrance of householdproducts as well as a common flavouring for food products. The flavouringsindustry utilises this close association between flavour and aroma to producechemical compounds that can be used to fulfil both functions, as the Reviewexplains,> “Both flavourings and fragrances are often referred to as ‘aroma chemicals’> with many of the same raw materials and similar production processes.”These chemical compounds can be used in various combinations to create a widevariety of flavours, as the Review indicates,> “For example, a popular strawberry flavouring may contain approximately 30> flavouring substances plus a flavouring preparation.”Due to their chemical nature, it is highly likely that none of these 30flavouring substances has been extracted from a real strawberry.The continuing growth of the flavourings industry means that new flavouringcompounds are continually being developed; however, it should be noted that someflavouring compounds have also been withdrawn from the market after they havebeen found to be associated with adverse health effects. Although the exactnumber is unknown, it is estimated that there are in excess of 2,500 flavouringcompounds currently in use by the food and other industries. These substancesare categorised by the Codex Flavourings standard under four headings,> “Flavourings may consist of flavouring substances, natural flavouring> complexes, thermal process flavourings or smoke flavourings...”The first category of flavouring substances is further subdivided by thestandard into two more categories, which are labelled, ‘natural’ and‘synthetic’. Synthetic flavouring substances are defined as,> “...flavouring substances formed by chemical synthesis.”Flavourings produced by chemical synthesis may be ‘chemically identical’ tonatural flavouring substances, but that does not make them identical. Thedifference between them can be illustrated by an example provided in the Review,which refers to the extraction of vanillin and states,> “Synthesised vanillin is chemically identical to vanilla extracted using> physical, enzymatic and microbiological processes, but cannot be labelled as> ‘natural’.”Clearly, a synthesised flavouring cannot be labelled as ‘natural’, but thishighlights the fact that they are different and that the difference is morefundamental than their chemical structure; foods are far more complex than aconglomeration of chemicals.Food ‘flavourings’ are not comprised entirely of synthetic chemicals; some ofthem are compounds that have been derived from natural plant materials that havea particular flavour or aroma component. It is the work of ‘flavour chemists’ toextract the required ‘components’ from these plants or other sources and create‘natural flavouring substances’, which are defined by the Codex Flavouringsstandard as,> “...flavouring substances obtained by physical processes that may result in> unavoidable but unintentional changes in the chemical structure of the> components of the flavouring...”It should be clear that changes in the chemical structure of a substance,including natural substances, can significantly affect its properties andfunctions. Furthermore, some of the processes involved in the extraction of a‘flavour component’ have some unpleasant consequences, one of which is describedin the Review,> “The extraction of flavourings often requires the use of solvents which may> leave a residue in the food or drink when the flavour is added.”Solvents are used solely to assist the extraction processes, they are not addeddirectly to foods; however, it is clear that solvent residues can remain in theflavouring compounds, which means that they may be transferred to the food. Thepresence of residues in foods is acknowledged on the web page entitledExtraction solvents, that refers to these solvents,> “…which are removed but which may result in the unintentional, but technically> unavoidable, presence of residues or derivatives in the foodstuff or food> ingredient.”One of the solvents used in some extraction processes is methanol, a hazardouschemical that is discussed in more detail later in this chapter. Another of thesolvents used in extraction processes is propylene glycol, which is a mainingredient of antifreeze. Although classified in the US as GRAS, propyleneglycol is associated with certain ‘side effects’, which is a clear indicationthat it cannot be regarded as ‘safe’ in the true meaning of the word.Flavourings, as indicated by Action on Additives, are also used in ‘non-food’products, including ‘medicines’. The purpose of flavourings in medicines,especially in liquid medicines intended for children, is to mask theirunpleasant and often bitter taste and to therefore make them palatable. However,the pleasant taste imparted by ‘flavourings’ also masks the reason that thesedrugs have an unpleasant flavour, which is because they are manufactured from avariety of chemical compounds, many of which are derived from petrochemicals.The Codex guideline clearly acknowledges that there is at least a potentialhealth ‘risk’ from the consumption of ‘flavouring’ compounds but only refers tothe management of this risk and to the establishment of,> “... risk management measures to reduce the risk to human health from such> flavouring substances...”As repeatedly discussed, safety testing is virtually always conducted onindividual chemicals or, very occasionally, on a limited combination ofchemicals. But, no matter how rigorous the testing protocols may have been, theyare unable to evaluate the full extent of the ‘risks’ to health because they donot test all possible interactions between all combinations of all the differentfood additives used by the food industry.There are clearly some serious health concerns for people who consumesignificant quantities of highly processed food products that contain a varietyof flavourings as well as other food additives. Although the regulatory bodiessuch as the CAC claim that their calculations incorporate sufficient safetymargins to cover all consumption habits, the Review indicates that theseevaluations may not be adequate,> “There remains debate over the safety of a number of flavouring compounds and> whether methods to assess intakes are sufficiently robust”A page entitled Flavourings-related lung disease on the NIOSH section of the CDCwebsite, discusses food flavourings that have been found to be associated withrespiratory problems for the workers in factories that utilise or produce thesecompounds. The web page refers to these flavouring chemicals as ‘very volatile’,which is the reason that they are easily inhaled and cause respiratory problems.One of the flavourings discussed on the page is diacetyl, a compound thatimparts a buttery flavour to foods. The factory where the respiratory problemshad been identified was one that used diacetyl in the manufacture ofmicrowaveable popcorn, although NIOSH claims that the studies,> “…were not able to definitely determine if diacetyl exposure contributed to> lung disease…”Nevertheless, the discussion on the NIOSH web page about the problems due to thevarious flavourings includes a particularly significant comment,> “Given the complexity of flavourings mixtures, and the lack of health data for> many of the component materials...”This statement is a clear acknowledgement that ‘flavourings’ are produced fromcomplex combinations of compounds, as indicated by the previously cited examplethat 30 different flavouring substances are used to produce one particularstrawberry flavour. It is also clear that the lack of health data means thatmany of the ‘component materials’ have not been adequately tested to determinetheir health effects, if at all. Nevertheless, diacetyl has been classified bythe FDA as GRAS. Diacetyl is not the only flavouring ingredient that is capableof producing harm; the NIOSH web page also states that,> “...the flavourings industry has estimated that over a thousand flavouring> ingredients have the potential to be respiratory hazards due to possible> volatility and irritant properties...”These properties indicate that there are at least a thousand flavouringsubstances that can be regarded as toxic and therefore capable of causing harmto health, but respiratory problems are not the only adverse health effects theymay cause. Flavourings that are produced from petrochemicals must all beregarded as inherently toxic and therefore totally unsuitable for use in foods.Monosodium Glutamate (MSG)Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is more correctly described as a ‘flavour enhancer’rather than a ‘food flavouring’ as it possesses no actual flavour of its own. DrRussell Blaylock explains in Health and Nutrition Secrets that,> “Monosodium glutamate is the sodium salt of glutamic acid, a form of> glutamate…”He adds the statement that,> “Glutamic acid is an amino acid that occurs naturally in many foods.”The creation of MSG is attributed to Professor Kikunae Ikeda, a Japanese chemistwho discovered that foods which contained a type of kelp used extensively inJapanese cuisine had a more intense flavour. In 1908, he isolated the chemicalthat seemed to produce the intensified flavour and developed a process for itsmanufacture. The process by which MSG is manufactured has since changed;according to the FDA web page entitled Questions and Answers on MonosodiumGlutamate (MSG),> “Today, instead of extracting and crystallizing MSG from seaweed broth, MSG is> produced by the fermentation of starch, sugar beets, sugar cane or molasses.”Since the initial introduction of MSG into the food industry in the US in thelate 1940s, its production and use have rapidly expanded to the extent that thissubstance is a common food additive in a wide variety of manufactured foodproducts. On the basis that no recorded adverse events had been associated withMSG, the FDA classified it as ‘GRAS’ when that category was first established in1958. Another justification for this classification is that the chemicalstructure of MSG is claimed to be identical to that of naturally occurringglutamic acid; as explained on the FDA Q&A web page,> “The glutamate in MSG is chemically indistinguishable from glutamate present> in food proteins.”As demonstrated in the previous discussion, the fact that two substances areregarded as ‘chemically indistinguishable’ does not mean that they areidentical; particularly if one substance is naturally occurring and the otherhas been synthesised in a chemist’s laboratory. This point is discussed in anarticle entitled On the Subject of Manufactured vs Natural Glutamic Acid byTruth in Labeling, an organisation that was founded by Dr Adrienne Samuels MDand her husband. The article, which is published on their website, states that,> “Central to their argument is the lie that the processed free glutamic acid> used in processed food is identical to the glutamic acid found in unprocessed,> unadulterated food and in the human body.”The reason that the natural unprocessed glutamic acid found in foods is notidentical to the processed glutamic acid is explained by Dr Blaylock,> “In nature, it is bound by peptide linkages, which are broken down solely> during the digestive process, thereby preventing the sudden surges that are> associated with the pure, processed additive MSG.”The ‘safety’ of MSG is the subject of an ongoing controversy, which began in thelate 1950s after animal experiments revealed that MSG could cause thedestruction of nerve cells in mice. In the late 1960s, Dr John Olney MD repeatedthe animal experiments, the results of which not only revealed the same nervedamage, they also revealed that damage had occurred in cells within thehypothalamus. Although he reported his findings to the FDA, no action was takento withdraw MSG from the market.As mentioned in the Truth in Labeling article, glutamic acid is also found inthe body; more specifically, this amino acid is a neurotransmitter that is foundin the brain and spinal cord. Under normal circumstances, glutamic acid iscarefully regulated by the body’s self-protective mechanisms, one of which isthe blood-brain barrier, a boundary that protects most areas of the brain and,as Dr Blaylock explains,> “…prevents most harmful substances in the blood from entering the interior of> the brain.”The blood-brain barrier does permit the passage of certain substances, includingamino acids, although the passage of any substance across this barrier isusually carefully controlled. It should be noted, however, that some toxicsubstances, including some pharmaceutical drugs, are able to breach theblood-brain barrier.The level of glutamic acid from a diet of unprocessed foods that do not containMSG is clearly regulated by a number of different mechanisms in the body.However, the consumption of processed MSG-laden food products can result inthese normal protective mechanisms being overpowered; this, in turn, can lead toa build-up of high levels of glutamate in the blood, as Dr Blaylock explains,> “By artificially adding very high concentrations of free glutamate to food,> blood glutamate levels in most people are far higher than were ever intended…”The consumption of MSG-laden food products can increase the amount of glutamatein the blood to the extent that it reaches a level that Dr Blaylock refers to ascritical. At this stage, the body’s normal protective mechanisms will be unableto function properly and the concentration of glutamate will become toxic toneurons and cause them to become ‘excited’. Glutamate is not the only substancecapable of causing harm to neurons; aspartate, which is discussed later in thischapter, acts in a similar manner. In Excitotoxins: The Taste That Kills, DrBlaylock explains the effects caused by critical levels of these substances,> “When neurons are exposed to these substances, they become very excited and> fire their impulses very rapidly until they reach a state of extreme> exhaustion.”Unfortunately, exhaustion is not the only type of harm that can be caused; DrBlaylock continues,> “Several hours later these neurons suddenly die, as if the cells were excited> to death.”These are serious effects that demonstrate the harmful nature of MSG.Another significant difference between manufactured MSG and natural glutamicacid is that the latter is comprised of a single amino acid, whereas the formeris always accompanied by impurities; as explained in the Truth in Labelingarticle,> “In contrast, the glutamic acid that is freed from protein through a> manufacturing process or through fermentation (i.e. processed free glutamic> acid) is always accompanied by a variety of impurities...”The article describes these impurities as by-products of the manufacturingprocesses; which also demonstrates that processed glutamic acid cannot beidentical to the natural substance. These impurities clearly exacerbate theinherently harmful nature of MSG.In addition to its use as a food additive, MSG is also used as a component ofother ingredients of processed food products; one of these is a group ofsubstances called ‘vegetable proteins’. It may be assumed that vegetable proteinis a healthy substance because vegetables are important sources of nutrients andprotein is a dietary requirement. However, this would be a mistaken assumption;the processes involved in the extraction of vegetable protein create a substancethat is far from healthy.There are different methods for extracting vegetable proteins; one of which ishydrolysis, the process that produces the substance called hydrolysed vegetableprotein. Dr Blaylock explains in Excitotoxins that the process of creating thissubstance begins with what he refers to as ‘junk’ vegetables that have a highglutamate content,> “The extraction process of hydrolysis involves boiling these vegetables in a> vat of acid. This is followed by a process of neutralization with caustic> soda. The resulting product is a brown sludge that collects on top. This is> scraped off and allowed to dry.”The resulting dried powder is the product referred to as ‘hydrolysed vegetableprotein’; in addition to glutamate and aspartate, Dr Blaylock states that thispowder also contains a number of other substances known to be carcinogenic.Nevertheless, it is added to a wide variety of processed food products, in orderto stimulate the consumer’s sense of taste and enhance the sensation of‘flavour’.The Truth in Labeling website contains a page with a list of food productingredients that may contain MSG; the information on this page states that allingredients referred to as ‘protein’ on a food product label will always containMSG. It should be noted that, as previously discussed, the Codex standard thatgoverns the labelling of pre-packaged foods states that an ingredient thatconstitutes less than 5 per cent of the food does not need to be declared on thelabel. This provision may enable food manufacturers to avoid the need to declarethe presence of MSG.In common with some of the other food additives discussed in this chapter, MSGis used in some pharmaceutical drugs; it is also used as a stabiliser in certainvaccines. The justification for these applications of MSG is that it is onlyused in very tiny amounts, which, according to the Paracelsus fallacy, meansthat drugs and vaccines can be claimed to be ‘safe’.Nothing could be further from the truth; the presence of MSG clearly adds to theharmful nature of these pharmaceutical products. The body of evidence thatdemonstrates MSG to be neurotoxic and harmful, means that this substance shouldnot be consumed in foods or in medicines; nor should it be injected into thebloodstream.Food PreservativesThe practice of food preservation has a long history; the oldest methods includesalting and drying, both of which reduce the water content of foods. Another oldmethod involves the use of ice and snow, which reduce the temperature of thefood. However, as demonstrated throughout this book, the fact that a practicehas a long history does not necessarily mean that it is a good one; this isparticularly the case with respect to the use of salt, which is discussed in thenext section.All foods, whether of plant or animal origin, undergo the natural processes ofdecay over the course of time; a situation that presented the food industry withanother ‘problem’ that they needed to solve. Unsurprisingly, the industry’ssolution to the problem of decay utilised the same resources that have suppliedsolutions to their other food manufacturing problems, such as the loss of colourand flavour; in other words, they sought the solution in chemicals. In theirlaboratories, chemists have created a variety of compounds for use as ‘foodpreservatives’; these substances have enabled processed food products to be ofimmense economic benefit to the food industry, as Paul Stitt explains in Beatingthe Food Giants,> “Processed foods are more profitable for a variety of reasons; with much of> the food value removed and dozens of preservatives added, processed foods last> practically forever.”It may be assumed that the ability of these products to ‘last practicallyforever’ is advantageous; but this would be a misleading assumption for reasonsthat are generally omitted from discussions about the subject, but are ofimmense importance.Firstly, decomposition is an entirely natural process; it is shown throughoutthis book that interference with natural processes is rarely beneficial, and isfrequently accompanied by detrimental, although unintended, consequences.Secondly, the poor level of establishment knowledge about nutrition means thatfew measures are taken to ensure that food products retain an adequate level ofnutrients. Thirdly, very little, if any, consideration is given to thedetrimental impact that preservatives have on the nutrients in foods. It shouldbe noted that different preservation methods affect foods and their nutritionalcontent differently.The nutritional content of virtually all foods begins to diminish as soon asthey have been harvested, or otherwise collected from their source, andcontinues to be reduced by storage, as indicated by a 1977 article entitledEffect of Storage on Nutritive Value of Food that states,> “With few exceptions, nutrient levels and/or their bioavailability are reduced> in foods following harvest, slaughter or collection.”The GSFA claims that the use of food additives, which include preservatives, isjustified on the basis that they perform various technological functions, one ofwhich is to ‘preserve the nutritional quality of the food’. It may be assumedtherefore that food preservatives contribute to the preservation of a food’snutritional content, but this too would be a mistaken assumption. One of thereasons this is a mistaken assumption is because the impact of chemical foodpreservatives on the nutritional content of the food products to which they havebeen added, is virtually unknown. This aspect of food preservation has not beenstudied, as indicated by a 1992 article entitled Nutritional aspects of foodpreservatives that states,> “Surprisingly, there is quite a lack of scientific knowledge in this field.”Nevertheless, despite an almost complete lack of knowledge about their impact onthe nutritional value of foods, different chemical substances are used toperform at least one of three different functions that are claimed to preservefoods. These functions are: to prevent microbial growth; to prevent or delayoxidation; and to inhibit the natural ripening process.The first function of ‘food preservatives’ clearly owes its origin to the ‘germtheory’ and the erroneous belief that microorganisms, especially bacteria, are‘dangerous’; as indicated by the EUFIC (European Food Information Council) webpage entitled Preservatives to keep foods longer – and safer, which states that,> “The primary reason for using preservatives is to make foods safer by> eliminating the influence of biological factors.”These ‘biological factors’ include yeasts and moulds as well as bacteria. Thediscussion in chapter three explained that bacteria are saprobes, or ‘naturaldecomposers’; which means that they break down dead and decaying matter into itsconstituent elements for reabsorption into the environment; this is ‘naturalrecycling’. The erroneous idea that bacteria, rather than natural processes, arethe cause of food decay has resulted in the creation of an entire range ofchemical food additives intended to ‘attack’ them; as explained on the EUFIC webpage,> “To delay the spoiling of foodstuffs by micro-organisms, anti-microbial> substances are used which inhibit, delay or prevent the growth and> proliferation of bacteria, yeasts and moulds.”Antimicrobial substances that are intended to poison bacteria, yeasts and mouldsdo not make food ‘safer’; instead, these poisons make foods less safe.A similarly erroneous idea about the effect of bacteria on food is shown by theclaim that bacteria cause ‘food poisoning’, which has been renamed and is nowreferred to as ‘food-borne disease’. The original label was, however, far moreapt as it described the real cause of the problem. Worryingly, ‘food-bornedisease’ is said to have become a significant health problem; as indicated bythe June 2019 WHO fact sheet entitled Food safety, which states that,> “An estimated 600 million – almost 1 in 10 people in the world – fall ill> after eating contaminated food and 420,000 die every year…”The WHO attributes the causes of food contamination to a number of factors,> “Unsafe food containing harmful bacteria, viruses, parasites or chemical> substances causes more than 200 diseases – ranging from diarrhoea to cancers.”It should be clear that bacteria, viruses and parasites can be eliminated fromthis list of causes. The remaining factor, namely ‘chemical substances’, are theonly ones relevant to ‘food-borne disease’. The fact sheet provides someexamples of ‘chemical substances’ that include POPs (persistent organicpollutants), such as dioxins, and heavy metals, such as lead, cadmium andmercury. There are, however, many thousands of chemicals that are eminentlycapable of causing severe health problems if consumed.Despite the recognition that chemical substances are relevant contributoryfactors, the medical establishment nevertheless retains its focus on ‘germs’ asthe major causes of ‘food-borne disease’, one example of which is botulism.Although it is not a common condition, botulism is said to be caused by toxinsproduced by a bacterium called Clostridium botulinum. These bacterial ‘toxins’are claimed to be neurotoxic; the symptoms they are said to cause can includerespiratory problems and paralysis. There is no explanation of how a bacteriumis able to produce these symptoms; however, there are many neurotoxic chemicalsthat have been proven to cause such symptoms; organophosphate pesticides forexample, as previously discussed.Some of the other substances that have the ability to induce symptoms that maybe diagnosed as a ‘food-borne disease’ include the chemical compounds used as‘food preservatives’. The EUFIC web page about Preservatives refers to a groupof compounds and states,> “Benzoic acid and its calcium, sodium or potassium salts (E210-213) are used> as antibacterials and antifungals in foods such as pickled cucumbers, low> sugar jams and jellies, dressings, condiments.”The EUFIC page also refers to the fact that, prior to their use, these chemicalswould have undergone safety assessments by the EFSA and JECFA; previousdiscussions have shown that these evaluations do not ensure that chemicals areabsolutely safe, but only relatively safe when used below the maximum permittedlevel in a food.It is claimed that benzoic acid occurs naturally in many plant and animalspecies and that it can be produced by microorganisms. Yet it is also claimedthat benzoic acid and its salts have antimicrobial properties; this anomaly isnot explained. One of the methods by which benzoic acid is commercially producedinvolves the oxidation of toluene, a highly toxic petrochemical that has beenclassified as a Group 1 carcinogen. Sodium benzoate is the benzoic acid saltthat was demonstrated by the Southampton University study to cause adversehealth effects when consumed in combination with certain food colourings; it hasbeen shown to release benzene when used in soft drinks and other beverages thatalso contain ascorbic acid.Other preservatives that are claimed to prevent bacterial growth include sodiumnitrate and sodium nitrite, both of which are commonly used in meats; they alsoact as colour fixatives to enhance the bright red colour of processed meats andmeat products such as bacon, ham, sausages and hot dogs. But these chemicalpreservatives have long been known to be toxic, as Dr Blaylock explains inHealth and Nutrition Secrets,> “For decades, food scientists and cancer specialists have known that nitrates> and nitrites were converted in the human stomach into powerful cancer-causing> substances called nitrosamines.”The second function of preservatives is to prevent oxidation, which is a normalprocess that results from exposure of foods to oxygen in the atmosphere andcauses discolouration; oxidation is the process that turns apples brown whenthey are cut open. This discolouration can be prevented or delayed through theuse of antioxidants; but ‘antioxidants’ are not all the same. In common withmost food additives, the antioxidants used by the food industry are generallysynthetic chemical compounds that are very different from the antioxidants thatoccur naturally in plant foods.The third function of preservatives is to inhibit the ripening process, which isclaimed to enable the shelf-life of food products to be significantly prolonged.One method used for this purpose is sterilisation, which destroys enzymaticactivity. However, enzymes are extremely important; they act as catalysts formany of the body’s biochemical reactions. They are also essential for theprocesses of digestion, as they assist the break-down of the component materialsof foods and the absorption of nutrients.Foods can be sterilised by a few different methods, some of which involvechemicals; sulphur dioxide for example, is used in some wines and in some driedfruits. Despite the claim that food preservatives make food ‘safer’, the EUFICweb page acknowledges that both sulphite compounds and benzoic salts areassociated with asthma, although it is claimed that asthma is only ‘triggered’in people who already suffer from this condition; asthma is discussed in chapterseven.Two other chemicals used to inhibit the natural ripening processes are BHA(butylated hydroxyanisole) and BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene), which are used ina large range of products that include margarines, salad dressings, cereals,preserved meat, beer and baked goods. The benefits of these chemicals to thefood industry is explained by Paul Stitt,> “Preservatives like BHT, BHA and EDTA keep food fresh for months, enabling> them to be manufactured more cheaply in huge centralized factories and shipped> long distances, or stockpiled until the price goes up.”The use of chemicals to inhibit ripening does not, however, keep food genuinelyfresh.The FDA has classified both BHA and BHT as GRAS, however, the 14th Report onCarcinogens published in 2016, described BHA as,> “Reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen.”BHT is not claimed to be carcinogenic, but it has been associated with adverseeffects in the liver, which is indicative of its inherent toxicity.It is clear that all of the chemicals used for the purpose of preserving foodsare toxic by nature; their function is to destroy enzymatic activity and impedenatural processes. The disruption to these processes means that the nutritionalcontent of any real food ingredients can be adversely affected by chemicalpreservatives to the extent that the food may no longer be able to fulfil itsbasic function.The use of preservatives to prolong the shelf-life of foods may be beneficial tofood producers, but it is far from beneficial for consumers. The inherentlytoxic nature of their chemical ingredients does not make food products safer; onthe contrary, chemical preservatives poison foods and therefore, make them farless safe.SaltIn chemistry, according to the Oxford Dictionary, a ‘salt’ is defined as,> “any compound formed by the reaction of an acid with a base.”More commonly, ‘salt’ refers to the chemical compound, sodium chloride.Salt has been used for millennia as a food preservative; the mechanism of actionby which salt achieves preservation involves osmosis and the withdrawal of waterfrom the cells, which inevitably causes dehydration. It is for this reason thatsalt is claimed to have antimicrobial properties.This mechanism of action means that salt also causes the cells of all livingorganisms, including humans, to become dehydrated. This is demonstrated by thefact that highly-salted foods generate thirst, which is the body’s mechanism forindicating a need for rehydration. Unfortunately, thirst is all too oftenaddressed by the consumption of liquid in the form of processed soft drinks. Butthese beverages are a poor choice of liquid with which to quench thirst; notonly do they fail to adequately rehydrate the body, but they increase the intakeof toxins as they contain a number of food additives, especially sugars orsweeteners, which are discussed in the next sections.There are a few different types of salt, the most common of which is referred toas ‘table salt’; a highly processed product. The basic materials required forthe manufacture of ‘table salt’ can be sourced from salt crystals or rock salt,which is then subjected to a number of processes. The first process involves theremoval of all other substances, including other minerals, to leave the basiccompound of sodium chloride. This compound is then subjected to two furtherprocesses, the first of which involves bleaching in order to whiten it. Thesecond process involves the addition of aluminium, which is said to act as ananti-caking agent. It should be noted that bleach and aluminium are bothhazardous substances.Salt is also used as a ‘flavour enhancer’; the food industry’s enthusiasm to usesalt for this purpose is indicated by an IoM (Institute of Medicine) 2010 Reportentitled Strategies to Reduce Sodium Intake in the United States that states,> “Added salt improves the sensory properties of virtually every food that> humans consume, and it is cheap.”The October 2018 WHO Healthy diet fact sheet recommends people to reduce theirintake of salt and states,> “Keeping salt intake to less than 5g per day (equivalent to sodium intake of> less than 2g per day) helps to prevent hypertension, and reduces the risk of> heart disease and stroke in the adult population.”Although the WHO recommends a reduced salt intake and the IoM recommends areduced sodium intake, the discussion about hypertension in chapter onedemonstrated that heart problems are more likely to occur due to an imbalancebetween sodium and potassium at the cellular level, and not to the absolutelevel of sodium as the result of the consumption of salt.There is, however, a great deal of confusing information about the consumptionof salt; the central theme of most debates on the topic is that it is only thehighly-processed form of salt that is unhealthy. The proponents of this ideaclaim that there are other types of salt that retain their original mineralcontent and are therefore nutritionally beneficial. But this idea is misleading.Sodium and chloride are essential mineral nutrients; they are both required forthe body’s bioelectrical system and chloride combines in the stomach withhydrogen to form hydrochloric acid, which is essential for proper digestion.However, like all nutrients, it is essential that sodium and chloride are in thecorrect ‘form’ for absorption into and utilisation by the body. But whetherother minerals are present or not, the compound called ‘salt’ does not containthe correct forms of sodium or chloride for the body; as indicated by HerbertShelton in Natural Hygiene Man’s Pristine Way of Life,> “How can salt be a food when it passes through the body unchanged, being> ejected from all of the ejector organs in the same state in which it is taken> into the stomach?”Dr Henry Bieler MD, who studied the effects of salt on the body and particularlyon the endocrine system, explains in Food Is Your Best Medicine that,> “Salt (sodium chloride) is frequently used to excess on foods because it> stimulates the adrenal glands, but it is really a highly corrosive drug – a> former embalming fluid which cannot be used in the body economy.”Its former usefulness as an embalming fluid is a clear demonstration that themain effect of salt in the body is to destroy enzymatic activity and causedehydration; it is also clear that the body does not recognise salt as anessential nutrient.It may be argued that some animals can absorb minerals directly from salt;however, as explained in chapter five, animals have different bodily systems,many of which are not directly comparable with the systems of the human body.For example, elephants are said to obtain minerals from ‘salt-licks’, but thisdoes not mean that humans can do likewise; elephants can consume and digestwhole acacia trees, including the bark and the leaves, humans are clearly unableto do likewise.Herbert Shelton also explains that salt has been used as an emetic; in otherwords, salt can be used to induce vomiting. It is claimed by the medicalestablishment that this effect is only produced by the ingestion of a largeamount of salt; the influence of the Paracelsus fallacy is again apparent.However, as Dr Bieler and Herbert Shelton have explained, salt is rejected bythe body whatever the amount ingested; a larger ‘dose’ only causes a morepronounced effect.The human digestive system absorbs its required nutrients from a diet thatincludes plants, fruits and vegetables, all of which provide a wide variety ofminerals, including sodium and chloride.SugarSugar is the collective name for a particular group of carbohydrates; theseinclude glucose, which is produced by the body, and fructose, which is foundpredominantly in fruits, although also in some vegetables. Glucose and fructoseare monosaccharides that have identical chemical formulae. Other sugars includelactose, which is found in milk, and sucrose, which is found in both sugar caneand sugar beet. Lactose and sucrose are disaccharides that have identicalchemical formulae, although these differ from the formulae of glucose andfructose.It is often claimed that all sugars are the same; however, nothing could befurther from the truth.Sugar cane is a plant of the grass family that is indigenous to Asia and onlygrows in a tropical climate; the initial discovery that this plant produced asweet-tasting juice is reported to have occurred many millennia ago. It is alsoreported that India was the first country to develop a method to process theliquid sap of the sugar cane and to produce sugar crystals.The introduction of sugar to other parts of the world is reported to have begunwith the planting of sugar cane in Brazil by the Portuguese. The popularity ofsugar in Europe encouraged the expansion of sugar production and led to theestablishment of many sugar cane plantations throughout South America and theCaribbean. The discovery that beets were also able to produce a sweet-tastingsubstance occurred in the 18th century; sugar beets only grow in a temperateclimate.The basic ingredient for the manufactured products generically referred to as‘sugar’ is the juice extracted mainly from cane sugar, although beet sugar mayalso be used. However, the extracted juice, which contains sucrose, is subjectedto many processes before it is transformed into ‘refined sugar’. William Duftydescribes this form of ‘sugar’ in his book entitled Sugar Blues,> “Refined sucrose, C12H22O11, produced by multiple chemical processing of the> juice of the sugar cane or beet and removal of all fiber and protein, which> amount to 90% of the natural plant.”The fact that these refining processes remove the nutrients means that theresulting product cannot be described as a ‘food’. Refined sugar is oftendescribed as providing ‘empty calories’; but this is not the only problem. Theconsumption of this highly processed form of sugar is also associated withcertain adverse effects that make it harmful to the human body, as William Duftyexplains,> “In addition, sugar is worse than nothing because it drains and leaches the> body of precious vitamins and minerals through the demand its digestion,> detoxification and elimination make upon one’s entire system.”Glucose is an entirely different type of sugar; it is produced by the body asthe result of the consumption of many types of food, as William Dufty explains,> “Many of our principal foods are converted into glucose in our bodies. Glucose> is always present in our bloodstream, and it is often called blood sugar.”Under normal circumstances, glucose is carefully controlled by the body; itplays an important role in many aspects of metabolism. However, the consumptionof refined sugars disrupts the body’s regulatory mechanisms and interferes withthe production of insulin; this disruption can result in diabetes, which isdiscussed in chapter seven.Fructose, which is the type of sugar that occurs naturally in many differentfruits and some vegetables, is also manufactured commercially and used tosweeten food products and drinks. Manufactured fructose is not the same asnatural fructose; one of the main differences is that they are metaboliseddifferently in the body. Whole foods, such as fruits, contain other elements,such as fibre, that enable the body to metabolise the fructose content slowlyand release the sugar into the bloodstream in a controlled manner. Refinedfructose, by comparison, does not contain those other elements and the body isunable to regulate the release of the sugar into the bloodstream.In common with salt, a great deal of misleading information is reported aboutsugar, including its role in the human diet and its effects. The adverse healtheffects associated with the consumption of refined sugar are, albeit to alimited extent, recognised by the medical establishment, as indicated by theOctober 2018 WHO Healthy diet fact sheet that recommends,> “Limiting intake of free sugars to less than 10% of total energy intake…”The reference to ‘energy intake’ is a clear indication of the erroneous notionabout the importance of ‘calories’ as the criteria by which nutrition should bemeasured. The WHO explains the meaning of the term ‘free sugars’ in the March2015 Press release entitled WHO calls on countries to reduce sugars intake amongadults and children,> “Free sugars refer to monosaccharides (such as glucose, fructose) and> disaccharides (such as sucrose or table sugar) added to foods and drinks by> the manufacturer, cook or consumer…”Although this press release refers to glucose and fructose as ‘free sugars’ thatneed to be limited in the diet, this is misleading; it is also somewhatconfusing because the WHO appears to clarify their statement by the commentthat,> “The WHO guideline does not refer to the sugars in fresh fruits and> vegetables…”The reason that the guidelines do not apply to the natural sugars found in wholefoods, such as fresh fruits and vegetables, is because, as the WHO acknowledges,> “…there is no reported evidence of adverse effects of consuming these sugars.”The WHO therefore makes the point very clearly that the consumption of wholefruits and vegetables does not cause the health problems associated with theconsumption of refined sugars. This is one point on which the WHO has not erred.Nevertheless, their recommendation that the intake of sugar should be ‘limited’is inadequate, because processed refined sugars are not foods and do not,therefore, form part of a healthy diet.In addition to being a common food ‘ingredient’, processed sugar is also used asa ‘food preservative’. The reason it is useful as a preservative is becauserefined sugar has a similar effect on cells as salt; in other words, refinedsugar draws water from cells through osmosis. It is for this reason that refinedsugar is also claimed to have ‘antimicrobial properties’ and to therefore beable to ‘protect’ foods.Sugar and salt are two of the most common food additives; although one is sweetand the other savoury, they are frequently used in the same food products andoften on the basis that they perform similar ‘technological functions’. They areboth considered to be preservatives and flavour enhancers; but neither of themcan be accurately described as a food.Although all forms of sugar are perceived to be food, this is misleading;refined sugar is associated with many adverse health effects, which are listedon a page entitled 141 Reasons Sugar Ruins Your Health on the website of DrNancy Appleton PhD; the list includes,> “Sugar interferes with the body’s absorption of calcium and magnesium;> Sugar can cause tooth decay;> Sugar can lead to obesity;> Sugar can cause arthritis;> Sugar can cause asthma;> Sugar can contribute to osteoporosis;> Sugar can cause toxemia during pregnancy;> Sugar can cause free radicals and oxidative stress;> Sugar upsets the mineral relationships in the body.”These are nine very good reasons to completely avoid refined sugar. One of themost significant effects is the production of free radicals, which is at theheart of virtually all health problems, as discussed more fully in chapter ten.Another adverse health effect, and one to which Dr Appleton does not refer, isthat sugar is associated with tuberculosis, although it is not claimed to be thecause. In his book, William Dufty states that the number of deaths fromtuberculosis increased in Britain during the 1700s, a period during which theconsumption of sugar also increased. He further states that,> “In 1910, when Japan acquired a source of cheap and abundant sugar in Formosa,> the incidence of tuberculosis rose dramatically.”It is officially recognised that there is an association between diabetesmellitus and tuberculosis; as indicated by a December 2009 article entitledTuberculosis and diabetes mellitus: convergence of two epidemics, which statesthat,> “There is growing evidence that diabetes mellitus is an important risk factor> for tuberculosis…”Whilst the medical establishment continues to adhere to the ‘germ theory’ andthe mistaken idea that TB is caused by a bacterium, they will never solve thisproblem, or that of diabetes, both of which are related to nutrition as well asother factors. The article also reports that ancient Indian writings recordcertain conditions that display similar symptoms to those of diabetes; this willbe further discussed in chapter eight, as TB and diabetes are both major healthproblems in India.It is clear that the natural sugars found in fresh foods are nutrients that thebody is perfectly able to metabolise and convert into materials necessary fornormal functioning. Unnatural sugars, such as those that have been refined bymanufacturing processes, are not metabolised by the body; in fact, they havebeen shown to be deleterious to the body. These refined sugars are appropriatelydescribed by William Dufty as,> “...the sweetest poison of all.”Artificial SweetenersThe recommendation by the WHO to reduce the intake of ‘free sugars’, in otherwords, processed refined sugars, is mainly based on the idea that sugar is highin calories and therefore contributes to obesity and overweight, which are ‘riskfactors’ for heart disease.The discussion in the previous section shows that the health problems associatedwith refined sugars is not related to the number of calories they contain.Unfortunately, the emphasis on the calorific value of foods encouraged the foodindustry to develop substances that provide sweetness but contain few, if any,calories. Foods that contain these sweeteners are often labelled ‘sugar-free’ or‘low calorie’.However, the replacement of sugars with artificial sweeteners, whether as anadditive to hot drinks, such as tea and coffee, or as additives in themanufacture of processed food products and drinks, is not an appropriatesolution.Although it may be assumed that foods and drinks with a reduced sugar contentare lower in calories and therefore a ‘healthy option’, this would be a mistakenassumption for a number of reasons, not least of which is that these foods anddrinks are invariably processed food products, which means they inevitablycontain a number of additives.The main reason is that artificial sweeteners are mostly, if not entirely,synthetic chemical compounds that are detrimental to health; they are not asuitable replacement for refined sugars, as two examples will demonstrate.SaccharinSaccharin is the name given to the chemical compound benzoic sulphimide, a coaltar derivative that is used by the food industry to sweeten both foods anddrinks. It is claimed to be approximately 300-400 times sweeter than sugar andcheaper to produce.The discovery that benzoic sulphimide had a sweet flavour is reported to havearisen accidentally as the result of laboratory experiments with coal tarderivatives conducted in 1879 by Constantin Fahlberg, a chemist who was workingat the Johns Hopkins University. This discovery led to the development of aproduct that was introduced into the market and sold to the public as a ‘lowcalorie’ sweetener called saccharin.In the early 20th century, Dr Harvey Wiley mounted a challenge to the use ofsaccharin during his relentless campaign against food adulteration. In 1908 heclaimed that, as a coal-tar derivative, saccharin was not a ‘food’; he alsoclaimed that it was not fit for human consumption and proposed that it should bebanned. Although his claims were correct, saccharin was not banned; the resultsof a number of experiments were claimed to demonstrate that small amounts werenot harmful; saccharin was classified by the FDA as GRAS in 1959.However, animal feeding studies were later conducted to assess the effects ofsaccharin consumption on rats. These experiments revealed that saccharin was apotential carcinogen; a revelation that led to its removal from the status ofGRAS in 1972 and to its listing as a carcinogen in 1981. It has subsequentlybeen revealed that rats have a different bodily mechanism and that it was thismechanism that accounted for the development of bladder tumours. As thismechanism does not exist in humans, it has been claimed that saccharin cannotcause human cancer. This new discovery has led to the removal of saccharin fromthe list of carcinogens in 2000 and to its approval for use, as indicated by theFDA website on a page entitled Additional Information about High-IntensitySweeteners Permitted for Use on Food in the United States that states,> “Saccharin is approved for use in food as a non-nutritive sweetener.”Furthermore, the FDA refers to saccharin as ‘safe for human consumption’.Chapter five discussed the evidence that animals are not suitable models forhumans, which was clearly demonstrated by the difference between rats andhumans; however, that does not provide evidence that saccharin is therefore‘safe’ for humans. It is a coal-tar derivative, which means that it isinherently toxic and should not be consumed.Its toxicity is demonstrated by the fact that saccharin is known to beassociated with a number of ‘side effects’; these include headaches, breathingdifficulties, diarrhoea, and skin problems. As previously discussed, all ‘sideeffects’ are, in reality, direct effects; these ‘effects’, which result from theconsumption of saccharin, indicate that it cannot be considered ‘safe’ forconsumption.AspartameAspartame is a highly popular and widely used artificial sweetener that is saidto be 200 times sweeter than sugar; it is a complex chemical compound that isdescribed as ‘a methyl ester of the aspartic acid/phenylalanine dipeptide’. TheEFSA published its assessment of aspartame in 2013, and states, on the web pageentitled Aspartame, that,> “The opinion concludes that aspartame and its breakdown products are safe for> general population (including infants, children and pregnant women).”Unfortunately, however, nothing could be further from the truth.The discussion about MSG revealed that glutamate and aspartate have a number ofcommon characteristics; they are both naturally-occurring amino acids and areboth neurotransmitters, which, under normal circumstances, are carefullycontrolled by the body’s protective mechanisms.Aspartame is a manufactured food additive product; it is used by the foodindustry to sweeten foods and drinks. The effects of aspartame are comparable tothose of MSG, because it increases the body’s level of the amino acid, in thiscase aspartate, and leads to circumstances that are no longer ‘normal’. Underthese circumstances, the body’s normal protective mechanisms become overwhelmedand processed aspartate, like processed glutamate, becomes neurotoxic.In Death by Modern Medicine, Dr Carolyn Dean refers to the research conducted byDr Betty Martini, who has revealed that the dangers from aspartame are a directresult of its chemical composition,> “Aspartame in molecular chemistry is composed of one molecule of aspartic> acid, one molecule of methanol (free methyl alcohol) and one molecule of> phenylalanine. Consider that this means 33% free methyl alcohol, a severe> metabolism poison”Dr Blaylock has also investigated the health hazards caused by aspartame andexplains in Health and Nutrition Secrets how these hazards occur,> “Both phenylalanine and aspartic acid are normally found in the nervous> system, but at higher concentrations both are neurotoxic.”It is for this reason that the establishment claim that aspartame is ‘safe’ iserroneous. Dr Blaylock further explains why aspartame is not safe forconsumption,> “…the metabolic breakdown of aspartame yields about a dozen toxic compounds,> some of which have been associated with cancer induction and alteration of> brain function.”In common with aspartame’s other components, methanol occurs naturally; however,there are natural mechanisms that prevent it from being toxic, as Dr Martiniexplains,> “Methanol occurs naturally in all plants, fruits and vegetables, but – in> nature – it is tied to the fibre pectin and is accompanied by its antidote,> ethanol, in greater quantities that prevents the methanol being metabolized> and it passes safely through the body’s system without causing any harm.”This demonstrates another similarity with glutamate, which, in nature, is boundto peptide linkages; this also indicates the errors that are made by theassumption that manufactured chemicals are identical to their naturalcounterparts; clearly, this is not the case. The ‘natural’ form of methanol isprocessed differently by the body; methanol, or methyl alcohol, is described byDr Blaylock as a ‘powerful toxin’; he adds that,> “When methyl alcohol is consumed, it is converted in the cells to formaldehyde> and formic acid, both potent toxins.”Foods and drinks that contain aspartame are claimed to be a healthier optionbecause they do not contain sugar; this too is clearly not the case.Unfortunately, soft drinks in aluminium cans pose an additional hazard; as DrBlaylock explains,> “So, in the case of diet drinks in aluminium cans, the very brain-toxic> aluminium fluoride compound co-exists with multiple toxins found in aspartame,> thus creating the most powerful government-approved toxic soup imaginable.”The health hazards associated with aspartame consumption include birth defectsand mental retardation; it is also associated with a number of diseases,including multiple sclerosis. Birth defects and autoimmune diseases arediscussed in chapter seven.The dangers associated with aspartame led Dr Blaylock to conclude that,> “This particularly nasty substance should have never even been approved for> human use.”Genetically Engineered FoodGenetic engineering (GE), also referred to as genetic modification (GM), is atechnology that is claimed to be vital for the ability to produce theever-increasing volume of food necessary to feed the ever-growing population ofthe world; this technology is, however, highly controversial, as are many of theclaims associated with it.A May 2016 report entitled Genetically Engineered Crops: Experiences andProspects was produced as the result of a study conducted by the US NationalAcademies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. This report, which will bereferred to as the NASEM report, defined the term ‘genetic engineering’ as,> “a process by which humans introduce or change DNA, RNA, or proteins in an> organism to express a new trait or change the expression of an existing> trait.”Although the terms ‘genetic engineering’ and ‘genetic modification’ are oftenused interchangeably, they are not regarded as identical techniques. It isclaimed that genetic engineering was first developed in the 1970s and thatgenetic modification, or manipulation, is a much older practice that is said torefer to the processes by which plants and animals have been ‘domesticated’. Thelatter claim is, however, grossly misleading; genetic modification techniques donot resemble traditional breeding methods, as will be demonstrated.The focus of this book is primarily on matters pertaining to health; however, insome instances, as with the current topic, a more wide-ranging discussion isnecessary to provide a fuller understanding of the topic and the issuesinvolved. The important additional issues for inclusion in the currentdiscussion involve the origins of the technology and the ideas from which it hasbeen developed, as well as the real purpose it is intended to serve, which isnot the elimination of hunger, as claimed. The existence of world hunger and itscauses are discussed further in chapter eight.Author F. William Engdahl has investigated the history of the ideas behind thedevelopment of GE technology and recorded his findings in his book entitledSeeds of Destruction, which is one of the sources for this discussion and willbe referred to as Seeds. In the introduction to Seeds, William Engdahl explainsthe wider context in which this subject needs to be contemplated,> “In actual fact, the story of GMO is that of the evolution of power in the> hands of an elite determined at all costs to bring the entire world under> their sway.”In addition, he ascribes the idea that a certain faction exerts control over theproduction of food to a statement that is attributed to Henry Kissinger,> “Control the food, and you control the people.”The idea that groups of people exert control over certain aspects of everydaylife may seem incredible, but the evidence provided by the discussions in boththis chapter and chapter nine will demonstrate otherwise.In his investigation of its history, William Engdahl explains that the origin ofgenetic engineering lies in ‘eugenics’. Although it is beyond the intended scopeof this discussion to explore the subject in detail, it must be noted thateugenics did not originate in Germany in the 1930s as is commonly believed.Instead, it began in Britain and was readily adopted in America, which becamethe two foremost countries to develop eugenics programmes. The term ‘eugenics’was coined in 1883 by Francis Galton, a British polymath and scientist, who wasa major proponent of eugenics and who encouraged the implementation of eugenicsprogrammes in Britain and the US. The purpose of these programmes was to developmethods with which to ‘improve the breed of man’; some of the methods used bythe programmes’ scientists included the sterilisation of people who were deemedto be ‘defective’.Outrageous though these programmes were, it can be seen that the underlying ideaof ‘eugenics’ has similarities with the underlying idea of genetic engineeringas defined in the NASEM report. The purpose of manipulating genes is to alterthe expression of existing traits or characteristics of organisms, which can beplant or animal in origin. The development of GE techniques resulted in thecreation, in 1974, of a genetically modified mouse; in 1994, a tomato was thefirst genetically modified food to become commercially available, although itwas not commercially successful.The techniques of genetic engineering are different from those used in eugenicsprogrammes, but they are both the result of the claim by certain groups ofpeople that they have the ‘right’ to use ‘science’ to create all kinds ofexperiments, including those that can manipulate nature and alter thecharacteristics of living organisms.The remainder of this discussion will focus on the genetic engineering of food.William Engdahl explains in Seeds that GE technology was developed as the resultof decades of prior agribusiness research that has its roots in the ‘GreenRevolution’, the purpose which he also explains,> “The heart of its strategy was to introduce ‘modern’ agriculture methods to> increase crop yields and, so went the argument, thereby to reduce hunger and> lessen the threat of a potential communist subversion of hungry unruly> nations.”The threat of ‘communist subversion’ has not been relevant since the end of theCold War; nevertheless, this same ‘strategy’ provides the essential aspects ofthe main argument that is used to promote genetic engineering; in other words,to increase crop yield and thereby reduce world hunger.Although referred to as ‘green’, this revolution was not ‘environmentallyfriendly’; it has proven to be the complete opposite because it involved thewidespread use of large quantities of chemicals, as indicated in Seeds,> “As one analyst put it, in effect, the Green Revolution was merely a chemical> revolution.”Some of the major problems faced by farmers involve ‘pests’, whether of theinsect or plant variety; another major concern for them is crop yield. The‘solutions’ to these concerns of the farmers, to whom the ‘Green Revolution’ waspromoted and sold, were found within the laboratories of the rapidly expandingchemical industry.Nitrogen had long been used as a component of explosive weapons; TNT(trinitrotoluene) for example, was developed in 1863. Many of the weaponsemployed during WWII also utilised nitrogen in its nitrate form as a maincomponent of the explosive material for bombs and shells. The US had produced asubstantial quantity of nitrates for their weapons, but were left with a largestock of the material at the end of that conflict.Plants require a variety of nutrients, one of which is nitrogen; however, plantscannot absorb atmospheric nitrogen, they can only absorb nitrates that arepresent in the soil. It was soon recognised that the stock of nitrates that wassurplus to the requirements of the military could be made useful foragricultural purposes, as it would provide the basic material for nitratefertilisers, which, together with pesticides and herbicides formed the corecomponents of the ‘Green Revolution’. These ‘modern agricultural methods’provided a substantial boost to the output and profits of the chemical industryas the ‘Green Revolution’ was gradually introduced during the 1950s and 1960sinto many countries, the first of which was Mexico.At the beginning of the 1980s, genetic engineering technologies were in theearly stages of development in the US and solely restricted to laboratoryexperimentation; at that time, there were mixed opinions within the scientificcommunity about the introduction of plants created through GE technology, asexplained in Seeds,> “In 1984, no serious scientific consensus existed within America’s research> laboratories on the dangers of releasing genetically modified plants into a> natural environment.”Nevertheless, in 1991, a mere seven years later, GM plants were experimentallyintroduced into Argentina whose population essentially became the first human‘guinea pigs’ on whom this technology was tested. However, no substantial orlong-term safety trials had been conducted prior to the release of thiscompletely novel technology into the real-world environment. The reason that theindustry failed to conduct substantial safety trials is explained by JeffreySmith in his book entitled Genetic Roulette, in which he quotes the US FDA 1992policy on GM foods,> “The agency is not aware of any information that foods derived by these new> methods differ from any other foods in any meaningful or uniform way.”This policy effectively claims that GM crops are the same as traditionally-growncrops; its purpose was to provide assurances to the general public that foodsproduced by this new technology were entirely ‘safe’. Although the FDA was inagreement with the industry about the alleged ‘safety’ of GM foods, there was adifference of opinion on the matter of which organisation should bear theresponsibility for those assurances of safety. In Genetic Roulette, JeffreySmith quotes the FDA as being of the opinion that,> “Ultimately it is the food producer who is responsible for assuring safety.”He also quotes the industry opinion on the matter, which, according to PhilipAngell of Monsanto, was that,> “Assuring its safety is the job of the FDA.”The denial of responsibility by both the biotech industry and the FDA isegregious.The claim that GE crops and non-GE crops are not meaningfully different led tothe creation of the term ‘substantial equivalence’. This is, however, a falsenotion; there are significant differences between GE crops and non-GE crops, aswill be demonstrated.The failure to conduct thorough, long-term safety trials to determine whetherthis entirely novel method of creating food was absolutely safe prior to releaseinto the real-world environment, has had serious consequences. Despite theclaims that GE foods are ‘safe’, they have been proven to be otherwise, but theevidence of their health hazards is mostly, although not entirely, suppressed bythe biotech industry.In 2012, Earth Open Source produced a report entitled GMO Myths and Truths: Anevidence-based examination of the claims made for the safety and efficacy ofgenetically modified crops, the Executive Summary of which states,> “Genetically modified (GM) crops are promoted on the basis of a range of> far-reaching claims from the GM crop industry and its supporters.”As indicated by its title, the report demonstrates that these claims are ‘myths’rather than ‘truths’. This report, which will be referred to as the GMO Mythsreport, is divided into seven sections, each of which contains a group ofrelated ‘myths’ that are countered by ‘truths’, all of which are supported byevidence. Section seven refers to a number of myths grouped under the generalheading Feed the World; the first myth of this group refers to the industryclaim that,> “GM crops are needed to feed the world’s growing population.”This myth is countered by the statement that,> “GM crops are irrelevant to feeding the world.”The theory that existing methods of food production are inadequate to feed thegrowing population of the world is based on an idea that is attributed to ThomasMalthus, a 19th century English economist, who claimed that food productionincreases at a different and much slower rate than that of population growth. Itwas believed that this discrepancy between the growth rates of food andpopulation numbers meant that there must be a maximum world population ‘carryingcapacity’, beyond which it would be impossible to produce sufficient food tofeed everyone.The GMO Myths report states that world hunger is not caused by an inadequatelevel of food production; a topic that is discussed in more detail in chaptereight. The viewpoint expressed in the GMO Myths report concurs with that of theUnion of Concerned Scientists (UCS), who, in 2009, produced a report entitledFailure to Yield: Evaluating the Performance of Genetically Engineered Crops,the Executive Summary of which states,> “Driven by economic and political forces, food prices soared to record highs> in 2007 and 2008, causing hardships around the world. Although a global food> shortage was not a factor then or now – worldwide food production continues to> exceed demand – those recent price spikes and localized scarcity, together> with rising populations in many countries and individuals’ rising aspirations,> have brought renewed attention to the need to increase food production in the> coming decades.”The existence of hunger is not in dispute; the reality of this tragic situationis demonstrated by a September 2017 WFP news release entitled World Hunger AgainOn The Rise, Driven By Conflict And Climate Change, New UN Report Says. Thenumber of people living in hunger is estimated to be approximately 815 million.Conflict is certainly relevant to the creation of conditions that can give riseto hunger; but it is not one of its direct causes. The GMO Myths report claimsthat hunger is,> “…a problem of distribution and poverty, which GM cannot solve.”These factors are certainly relevant, but they are not the only causes ofhunger.It should be clear from previous discussions that ‘climate change’ cannot beregarded as the cause of any of the world’s problems, including hunger;nevertheless, it is implicated as a causal factor of problems associated withagriculture. Section six of the GMO Myths report refers to the claim that,> “GM will deliver climate-ready crops.”Farmers have used traditional breeding methods to improve tolerance to a varietyof conditions for millennia; these methods are able to improve crop tolerance toextreme weather conditions such as floods and drought, neither of which iscaused by or is specific to ‘climate change’. The biotech industry, on the otherhand, believes that only GE technology can address these environmental stresses.An example of the industry efforts to control the situation can be seen in USPatent number 7851676 entitled Stress tolerant plants and methods thereof;although there are six individuals listed as the inventors, the assignee, orowner, is Monsanto Technology LLC. The first claim of this patent refers to,> “A method of generating a transgenic plant with enhanced tolerance to> environmental stress...”The GMO Myths report explains that,> “Tolerance to extreme weather conditions involves complex, subtly regulated> traits that genetic engineering is incapable of conferring on plants.”According to the GMO Myths report, one of the reasons that GE technology isirrelevant to ‘feeding the world’ is because it is unable to achieve theincreased crop yields it is claimed to produce. This point is confirmed by theUCS report, which was produced as the result of a detailed evaluation of GEcrops,> “This report is the first to evaluate in detail the overall, or aggregate,> yield effect of GE after more than 20 years of research and 13 years of> commercialization in the United States. Based on that record, we conclude that> GE has done little to increase overall crop yields.”In the conclusion to the report it is acknowledged that there have been overallincreases in crop yields, but that these increases were largely achieved bymethods other than those that involved GE technology,> “Most of the gains are due to traditional breeding and improvements of other> agricultural practices.”The fact that traditional breeding methods outperform GE technology methods isdiscussed in section one of the GMO Myths report, the first ‘myth’ of whichclaims that GE technology is an extension of natural breeding techniques. Thismyth is refuted by the ‘truth’ that,> “…GM is a laboratory-based technique that is completely different from natural> breeding.”Throughout a large part of human history, people have grown food and developedmethods for ‘breeding’ crops and for creating hybrid varieties; these processeswere, and still are, ‘natural’. These methods enable different varieties of thesame crop to be cross-bred, the result of which is intended to encourage certainbeneficial traits, such as drought resistance, for example. If successful, theimproved traits will be emphasised in the new seeds and successive generationsof the plants and crops.Genetic engineering is not an extension of natural breeding; GE techniquesinvolve the insertion of genetic material into a plant cell. This is acompletely unnatural process that bears no resemblance to traditionalcross-breeding methods and techniques. The GMO Myths report explains the GEprocess to highlight the difference between this technology and naturalbreeding,> “The genetic engineering and associated tissue culture processes are imprecise> and highly mutagenic, leading to unpredictable changes in the DNA, proteins> and biochemical composition of the resulting GM crop...”Another myth that is exposed by the GMO Myths report is that GM crops reduce theuse of pesticides and herbicides; this myth is countered by the truth that GMcrops increase their use because,> “Herbicide-tolerant crops have been developed by agrochemical firms> specifically to depend upon agrochemicals and have extended the market for> these chemicals.”In 2003 the Institute of Science in Society prepared a Report entitled The Casefor a GM-Free Sustainable World. This report, which is authored by a number ofindependent scientists, discusses many of the problems and issues with GM cropsincluding the use of toxic herbicides, which they have been developed totolerate. These herbicides include glufosinate ammonium and glyphosate, aboutwhich the report states,> “Both are systemic metabolic poisons expected to have a wide range of harmful> effects and these have been confirmed.”It should be noted that glyphosate has been classified by the IARC as a‘probable’ human carcinogen.On the website of the Center for Food Safety is a September 2014 articleentitled Debunking Popular Myths about GE Crops Portrayed in the Media. Includedin this article is a reference to the myth that GE crops use chemicals of lowertoxicity, but more worryingly, is the statement that,> “...next generation GE crops will further increase pesticide usage of even> stronger, more toxic herbicides...”The reason for the perceived need to use stronger pesticides is that many of the‘pest’ plants, on which the toxic herbicides have been used, have developedresistance, especially to glyphosate. The biotech industry’s ‘solutions’ to thisproblem, as indicated by the article, include the introduction and use ofstronger pesticides and the development of a new generation of GE crops.One particularly toxic pesticide, which was approved by the EPA in 2014 for usewith GE crops, is a product that contains a blend of glyphosate and 2,4-D(2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid). 2,4-D is not a new pesticide; it was one ofthe ingredients of Agent Orange, the highly toxic chemical that is best knownfor its use as a defoliant during the Vietnam war. The Beyond Pesticides factsheet about 2,4-D states that the health hazards with which this toxic substancehas been linked include cancer, endocrine disruption and neurotoxicity.Another of the industry claims exposed in the GMO Myths report is that GM cropsare safe to eat; however, the truth is that,> “Studies show that GM foods can be toxic or allergenic.”It is impossible to tell the story of GMOs without referring to Dr Arpad PusztaiPhD, a biochemist who formerly worked at the Rowett Research Institute inScotland and who, initially, was a supporter of GE technology and believed itwould help to improve crop yield. In the mid-1990s, he conducted rat-feedingstudies with genetically modified potatoes; however, the results of hisexperiments caused him to be concerned because they demonstrated a range ofadverse effects.In 1998, a programme was aired on British TV that contained an interview with DrPusztai in which he openly discussed his research and the results he hadobtained; he is also reported to have stated that he would not eat GM foods.Although he had received prior approval from the Rowett Institute for thisinterview, the programme caused a furore; it had exposed the existence of healthhazards as a direct result of the consumption of GM foods, which was in directcontradiction to the biotech industry’s claims of safety. Shortly afterwards, DrPusztai was suspended from the Institute and vilified in the press on the basisthat his work had not been published or ‘peer-reviewed’. This situation wasrectified in 1999 by the publication of his study article in The Lancet; areputable journal that was, nevertheless also attacked and subjected to severecriticism by the pro-GM community. The study article is entitled Effect of dietscontaining genetically modified potatoes expressing Galanthus nivalis lectin onrat small intestine; it is available from the website of The Lancet.The unfounded claims levelled against Dr Pusztai and his work were clearlyintended to discredit him, despite the fact that he was considered to be anauthority in his field of research and that, at that time, his study wasconsidered by many to have been the most thorough research that had beenconducted on a GM food. It is clear that his study results needed to besuppressed as they posed a serious challenge to the biotech industry andcontradicted the claim that GM foods were safe.In his 2009 article entitled GMO Scandal: The Long Term Effects of GeneticallyModified Foods on Humans published on the website of the Center for Research onGlobalisation, William Engdahl reports the continuing suppression of studyresults other than those that have been approved by the industry. He statesthat,> “The only research which is permitted to be published in reputable scientific> peer-reviewed journals are studies which have been pre-approved by Monsanto> and the other industry GMO firms.”In 2011 Dr Vandana Shiva PhD, Debbie Barker and Caroline Lockhart of Navdanya,co-authored a report entitled The GMO Emperor Has No Clothes, which discussesthe problems with GMOs. This report, which will be referred to as the GMOEmperor report, refers to information obtained by a group, comprised of CRIIGEN(the Committee of Independent Research and Information on Genetic Engineering)and two French universities, about Monsanto’s 2002 rat feeding trials. Theinformation discovered by the group was that the rats had suffered organ damageafter being fed three varieties of approved GE corn. The GMO Emperor reportcites the words of Dr Gilles Eric Seralini PhD, a molecular biologist, whorefers to this information about the effects on the rats and states that it,> “...clearly underlines adverse impacts on kidneys and liver, the dietary> detoxification organs, as well as different levels of damage to the heart,> adrenal glands, spleen and haematopoietic systems.”Although, as discussed, animals are not suitable models for humans, theseresults demonstrate the existence of serious harm to rats and indicate thepotential for harm to humans; it is therefore inappropriate for the industry toclaim that GM foods are safe. These adverse impacts cannot be dismissed asirrelevant; they are systemic and not merely due to a different mechanism in oneorgan, as was the case with saccharin.One of the theories on which genetic engineering is based claims that each genecodes for a single protein that expresses a specific trait or characteristic. Onthe basis of this theory, it was assumed that, as the human body containedapproximately 100,000 proteins, it would contain an equal number ofprotein-coding genes. It was also believed that this assumption would beverified by the Human Genome Project.However, to the amazement of many scientists, the results from this Project haverevealed that the human genome only contains approximately 20,000 protein-codinggenes; far fewer than had been expected. This discovery has completelyundermined the theory that one gene codes for one protein; a theory that iscentral to genetic engineering. The implication of this discovery is explainedby Dr Barry Commoner, a former senior scientist at the Centre for the Biology ofNatural Systems at Queens College, who states, in his 2002 article entitledUnraveling the DNA Myth: The spurious foundation of genetic engineering, that,> “The fact that one gene can give rise to multiple proteins ... destroys the> theoretical foundation of a multibillion-dollar industry, the genetic> engineering of food crops.”The problem with GE technology extends beyond the discovery that genes can codefor multiple proteins; it is exacerbated by the fact that the genes insertedinto a plant cell have been taken from another species, often a bacterium; asituation that has absolutely no precedent in nature. Dr Commoner expands onthis point in his article and states,> “In genetic engineering it is assumed, without adequate experimental proof,> that a bacterial gene for an insecticidal protein, for example, transferred to> a corn plant, will provide precisely that protein and nothing else.”The techniques involved in genetic engineering are claimed to be precise and theresults predictable; the GMO Myths report, however, states that the processesare crude, imprecise and unpredictable and that GM technology,> “…is based on a naïve and outdated understanding of how genes work.”Dr Commoner expands further on the failure of GE processes to be either preciseor predictable and indicates the potentially serious consequences,> “Yet in that alien genetic environment, alternative splicing of the bacterial> gene might give rise to multiple variants of the intended protein – or even to> proteins bearing little structural relationship to the original one, with> unpredictable effects on ecosystems and human health.”On the basis that many proteins play important and even critical roles in thebody, GE technology is clearly another example of a misplaced intervention innatural processes that has proven to cause a range of adverse consequences, someof which are entirely unpredictable. Molecular geneticist, Dr Michael AntoniouPhD, is quoted by Jeffrey Smith in his book, to have stated that,> “If the kind of detrimental effects seen in animals fed GM food were observed> in a clinical setting, the use of the product would have been halted...”In addition to the modification of seeds, genetic engineering is also used tocreate various enzymes and proteins that are included in the ingredients of manyprocessed food products, although not always labelled as such. For example, twoof the amino acids that comprise aspartame, namely aspartic acid andphenylalanine, are produced using processes that involve genetically modifiedbacteria.Another ‘myth’ is the industry claim that GM foods are more nutritious. The GMOMyths report refutes this claim with specific reference to certain GM ricevarieties that,> “…had unintended major nutritional disturbances compared with non-GM> counterparts, although they were grown side-by-side in the same conditions.”The fundamental purpose of eating is to supply the body with nutrients; thedisturbances to the nutritional content of GM foods by comparison with non-GMfoods further demonstrates that they are not ‘substantially equivalent’.There is clear evidence that GM foods are not ‘safe’ and that, in reality, theyare harmful. Herbicides are, by definition, toxic; their purpose is to killunwanted plant ‘pests’ whilst sparing the crops that have been geneticallyengineered to be resistant to them. Although Dr Pusztai claimed that pesticideswere not the cause of the adverse health effects he observed, the fact that GMcrops are liberally sprayed with these toxic chemicals means that they willinevitably contain residues that are harmful to human health.One of the most widely-used herbicides is glyphosate, which is the main activeingredient in a popular product called Roundup. In his 2010 article entitledStudy Shows Monsanto Roundup Herbicide Link to Birth Defects, William Engdahlstates,> “Roundup in far lower concentrations than used in agriculture is linked to> birth defects.”The study to which he refers is reported in an article entitled Glyphosate-basedherbicides produce teratogenic effects on vertebrates by impairing retinoic acidsignalling, on the website of the American Chemical Society. The study wasinitiated due to,> “Reports of neural defects and craniofacial malformations from regions where> glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH) are used...”The study investigated the effects of glyphosate on animal embryos; theabnormalities, including teratogenic effects, that were discovered bore astriking similarity to the malformations observed in human babies, as thearticle explains,> “The direct effect of glyphosate on early mechanisms of morphogenesis in> vertebrate embryos opens concerns about the clinical findings from human> offspring in populations exposed to GBH in agricultural fields.”Glyphosate is not the only chemical that has been associated with birth defects.Many animal feeding studies involving GM foods have demonstrated a variety ofadverse effects that have involved various organs, mainly the liver and kidneys,and many different systems, such as the bloodstream and digestive system andparticularly the endocrine system, which is the reason for birth defects.The failure to conduct long-term safety testing trials of GM foods prior totheir release into the market has been exposed by the launch of a new long-termstudy. This study is reported in a November 2014 article entitled Largestinternational study into safety of GM food launched by Russian NGO. The articlestates that the study was to begin in 2015 and to be a 3-year experiment toinvestigate the long-term health effects of GM foods. It is reported that theresearchers plan to use GM maize developed by Monsanto and that the purpose ofthe study is to answer the question about the safety of GM food. This is clearlya question that should have been both asked and satisfactorily answered longbefore any GM crops were allowed to be introduced into the real-worldenvironment. However, the control by the biotech industry over the publicationof the results of GM food studies, if they are unfavourable, raises questionsover the information this study will be able to reveal.Furthermore, the term ‘substantial equivalence’ was deliberately created notonly to generate the impression that GE foods were no different from non-GEfoods, but to also avoid conducting expensive safety trials. This is revealed bythe GMO Emperor report that quotes a 1999 article entitled Beyond ‘substantialequivalence’, which refers to substantial equivalence as,> “…a pseudo-scientific concept… It is, moreover, inherently anti-scientific> because it was created primarily to provide an excuse for not requiring> biochemical or toxicological tests.”It is clear, therefore, that the real purpose behind the introduction of GE‘technology’ is largely related to the ability to control the food supply; someof the mechanisms through which this control is being established involves theuse of patents, as the GMO Emperor report states,> “GMOs are intimately linked to seed patents. In fact, patenting of seeds is> the real reason why industry is promoting GMOs.”The report expands on this point to show that the acquisition of seed patentsdoes not conform to the normal procedures of competition within the sameindustry,> “The giant seed corporations are not competing with each other. They are> competing with peasants and farmers over the control of the seed supply.”One of the essential elements of traditional breeding methods involves thecollection of seeds, either for planting to produce the next crop or fordeveloping new varieties or new tolerances. But this practice is being eroded bythe biotech industry that denies farmers the ‘right’ to collect seeds because GMseeds do not ‘belong’ to them; farmers are therefore forced to purchase seedsannually from the giant biotech corporations that seek to control agriculture,as the GMO Emperor report states,> “Monopolies over seeds are being established through patents, mergers and> cross licensing arrangements.”This situation makes farming far more expensive for the people, but hugelylucrative for the corporations, as the report continues,> “Patents provide royalties for the patent holder and corporate monopolies.”The problem is not merely one of profiteering by the industry, it hasfar-reaching consequences, as the report indicates,> “The combination of patents, genetic contamination and the spread of> monocultures means that society is rapidly losing its seed freedom and food> freedom.”Despite the claim by establishment scientists that genetic engineeringtechnology is specific, precise, predictable and safe, it has been demonstratedin this discussion to be unspecific, imprecise, unpredictable and unsafe. DrBarry Commoner stated in 2002 that,> “The genetically engineered crops now being grown represent a massive> uncontrolled experiment whose outcome is inherently unpredictable. The results> could be catastrophic.”There is a growing awareness about the problems associated with GM foods, but ithas led to calls for them to be labelled; these efforts, although well-meaning,are misplaced, they will ultimately result in the elimination of choice, as theGMO Emperor report states,> “GMOs contaminate non-GE crops. Contamination is inevitable, since> cross-pollination is inevitable, within the same species or with close> relatives.”The only genuine solution to the problem of GE technology is an immediate andoutright ban; it is the only course of action that can genuinely ensure thecontinuing availability of wholesome foods for the entire world population; notonly for present generations, but for all future generations.Poisoned WaterWater is an essential component of the cells of living organisms, includinghumans.Although not categorised as a nutrient, water plays a vital role in all of thebody’s biochemical processes, as Herbert Shelton explains in Natural Hygiene:Man’s Pristine Way of Life,> “Indeed, all the chemico-vital processes or changes that take place in the> living body require the presence of water and a deficiency of it soon> manifests itself in disturbances of these operations.”Water is lost from the body through natural functions, such as excretion andsweating, and therefore needs to be replaced to avoid dehydration, which canhave serious health consequences. Although it is essential that lost fluids arereplaced, there are differing opinions about the quantity of water that shouldbe consumed each day; this important topic is discussed in chapter ten. It isthe quality of drinking-water that is the focus of the discussion in thissection.The importance of providing good quality water for all purposes is recognised bythe February 2018 WHO fact sheet entitled Drinking-water that states,> “Safe and readily available water is important for public health, whether it> is used for drinking, domestic use, food production or recreational purposes.”According to the USGS (US Geological Society) web page entitled How Much Wateris There on Earth? an estimated 71 per cent of the Earth’s surface is covered bywater, of which approximately 96.5 per cent is sea-water. Of the remaining 3.5per cent that is fresh water, more than two-thirds is locked in ice, glaciersand permanent snow. This means that only about 1 per cent of the total volume ofwater on the planet is in the form of liquid freshwater, most of which islocated in groundwater and therefore below the surface; this leaves only acomparatively tiny volume located in surface waters, such as rivers and lakes.Yet this precious resource in all its locations has been, and continues to be,‘poisoned’.It must be noted that, as with ‘poisoned food’, the deliberate poisoning ofwater with intent to cause harm forms no part of this discussion.The WHO Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality report, originally published in2011, was updated in 2017; this fourth edition of the report incorporatesadditional material, including the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) thatrelate to water. The UN 2030 Agenda and a number of the SDGs are discussed ingreater detail in chapter eight; it should be noted for the purposes of thisdiscussion that SDG 6.1 aims to,> “By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable> drinking water for all.”The WHO report, which will be referred to as the Water Guidelines report, statesthat,> “The primary goal of the Guidelines is to protect public health associated> with drinking-water quality.”It would seem from the stated objectives of the UN and WHO that their policieswill ensure that water made available for human consumption will be safe.Unfortunately, the word ‘safe’ is used in the same context in these reports asit is used in the Codex Alimentarius food guidelines; in other words, ‘safe’ isa relative term, as demonstrated by the Water Guidelines report that states,> “Every effort should be made to achieve drinking water that is as safe as> practicable.”Efforts to make water ‘safe’ ought to involve the removal of all hazardousmaterials prior to the water being made available for human consumption.However, ‘as safe as practicable’ does not mean that all hazards have beenremoved; as the Water Guidelines report indicates, the purpose of therecommended strategies is to,> “…ensure the safety of drinking-water supplies through the control of> hazardous constituents of water.”Unfortunately, their rigid adherence to the ‘germ theory’ means that, accordingto the medical establishment, the main ‘hazardous constituents of water’ aremicrobes; as indicated by the report that refers to,> “microbial hazards, which continue to be the primary concern in both> developing and developed countries.”The main strategies to address these microbial hazards in order to make water‘safe’ are discussed in the next section.It is recognised that sanitation, hygiene and water are closely related issues;this is demonstrated by SDG 6.2, the aim of which is to,> “By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for> all…”It was shown in chapter two that the introduction of sanitary measures played asignificant role in achieving improved public health, although this is oftenerroneously attributed to vaccination programmes. It is clear that insanitaryconditions can adversely affect water quality, but the WHO nevertheless promotesthe erroneous idea that ‘germs’ are the major cause of health problems. The WHOweb page entitled Water-related diseases lists a number of diseases claimed tobe caused by ‘germs’ and transmissible through water; one of these diseases ischolera, which is discussed in chapter eight. Surprisingly, this list alsoincludes malnutrition; the WHO claims the nature of the relationship betweenwater and malnutrition to be that,> “Nutritional status is compromised where people are exposed to high levels of> infection due to unsafe and insufficient water supply and inadequate> sanitation.”Unsafe water does not cause ‘infections’; however, inadequate sanitationmeasures can clearly lead to the contamination of water, which, if consumed,would certainly be detrimental to health. The real relationships betweenmalnutrition, insanitary living conditions and illness are also discussed inchapter eight.The erroneous belief that ‘microbes’ pose the main threat to water quality meansthat an inadequate level of attention is paid to the real sources of waterpollution. Although the phrase ‘dangerous contaminants’ refers to ‘microbes’,nevertheless, the WHO Drinking-water fact sheet does refer to genuinecontaminants in the statement that,> “Inadequate management of urban, industrial and agricultural wastewater means> the drinking-water of hundreds of millions of people is dangerously> contaminated or chemically polluted.”The recognition that industrial wastes and chemicals are major sources of waterpollution is demonstrated by the aim of SDG 6.3, which is to,> “By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and> minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials…”Although the Water Guidelines report refers to the contamination of water bychemicals, it downplays their importance as pollutants in the statement that,> “There are many chemicals that may occur in drinking-water; however, only a> few are of immediate health concern in any given circumstance.”The main justification for making such a statement is that the chemicals occurin amounts that are considered to be too low to cause any ‘risks’ to health; theerroneous nature of the theory on which this justification is based has beendiscussed.Previous discussions have also demonstrated that chemicals are inadequatelytested for their safety, and that the tests that have been conducted fail toinvestigate effects from exposures to the multiple combinations of chemicals towhich people are exposed, including those that may occur in drinking water."},{"pageContent":"The claim that water is ‘safe’ because it is contaminated by only a fewchemicals ‘of concern’ is therefore unfounded as it is not supported byevidence. More importantly, there is a large body of evidence that demonstratesmany of the chemicals that pollute water are of significant concern with respectto human health.There are many chemicals that pollute water and most of them are produced anddischarged by a variety of different industries, as will be discussed. Thereare, however, two chemicals that are intentionally added to water, although fordifferent purposes, which require particular attention.Water ChlorinationOne of the main ways in which drinking-water is poisoned is, paradoxically, theprocess by which water is claimed to be made ‘safe’, namely disinfection, aboutwhich the Water Guidelines report states,> “Disinfection is of unquestionable importance in the supply of safe> drinking-water.”Nothing could be further from the truth. Disinfection is inherently toxic; itssole purpose is to kill germs, as the report states,> “The destruction of pathogenic microorganisms is essential and very commonly> involves the use of reactive chemical agents such as chlorine.”Chlorine has been discussed at some length earlier in the chapter; however, itsuse as a water ‘disinfectant’ requires further examination.One of the earliest applications of chlorine involved textile bleaching. Anotherapplication arose from the discovery by French scientists that chlorinecompounds would not only reduce the ‘odours of putrefaction’ that permeated thestreets of France in the early 19th century, they would also delay putrefaction;these chemicals therefore became useful for industries that produced noxiousputrefaction odours; abattoirs, for example.Although chlorine compounds may have succeeded in masking odours from decomposedorganic material and waste matter, they did not eliminate the cause of theproblem. The discussion about preservatives demonstrated that decomposition is anormal process and that delaying this process does not ‘solve’ the problem. Theuse of chlorine compounds to mask ‘noxious odours’ merely exacerbated thehazards to health.The emergence and dominance of the ‘germ theory’ in the late 19th centuryencouraged the notion that ‘germs’ needed to be destroyed. The belief thatdiseases were transmitted through water stimulated scientists to believe thatchlorine would be a useful ally in the battle against the ‘germs’ found inwater; the addition of chlorine compounds to water supplies for disinfectionpurposes began in the early 20th century. At the time it was believed that, whenadded to water, chlorine would dissipate and leave no residue; this was,however, a mistaken belief, but the mistake was not discovered until the 1970s.The reality is that, as discussed, chlorine-based compounds react with organicmatter to produce toxic organochlorines that are persistent; which means thatthey remain present throughout the water system.One of the major problems resulting from the use of chlorine for ‘disinfection’is the production of DBPs (disinfection by-products), which are explained by JoeThornton in Pandora’s Poison,> “The myriad by-products formed in the disinfection of drinking water with> chlorine also find their way to people mainly though tap water – by drinking,> absorption through the skin, or inhalation during a hot shower or bath.”The DBPs formed as the result of water chlorination include a group called THMs(trihalomethanes), a common type of which is chloroform, a toxic substance thathas been classified by the IARC as ‘possibly carcinogenic’.The EPA web page entitled National Primary Drinking Water Regulations contains atable that lists various water pollutants, one of which is labelled TTHMs (totaltrihalomethanes). Within the table is a heading labelled ‘Potential HealthEffects from Long-Term Exposure Above the MCL’; the entry in this table forTTHMs lists,> “Liver, kidney or central nervous system problems; increased risk of cancer.”MCL means ‘maximum contaminant level’. The claim that health problems only occurwhen exposures exceed the MCL is unfounded. The serious nature of the effectsproduced in the body’s important detoxification organs and the CNS is a clearindication of the severe toxicity of TTHMs. It should be clear that toxicsubstances always cause harm; the size of the ‘dose’ only determines the degreeof harm they cause.The EPA recognises that DBPs generate risks to health, but water disinfection isnevertheless claimed to be essential due to the perceived need to destroy germs.This paradox, which claims that toxic substances can be used to make water‘safe’, creates a challenge for the water industry, as the EPA explains in adocument entitled Introduction To The Public Water System Supervision Program,> “A major challenge for water suppliers is how to balance the risks from> microbial pathogens and disinfection byproducts.”The health risks from DBPs are deemed ‘acceptable’ because it is believed thatmany ‘infectious diseases’ are associated with water and inadequate sanitation,as indicated by the February 2018 WHO fact sheet entitled Sanitation thatstates,> “Poor sanitation is linked to transmission of diseases such as cholera,> diarrhoea, dysentery, hepatitis A, typhoid and polio.”It should be clear that the addition of toxic chemicals to faecally-contaminatedwater does not remove the faecal matter, even though it may delay or even haltthe processes of decomposition. The use of chlorine-based compounds, or anyother toxic chemicals, to ‘disinfect’ water clearly does not make it ‘safe’;this fact is acknowledged, albeit to a limited extent, by the Water Guidelinesreport that states,> “Chemical disinfection of a drinking-water supply that is faecally> contaminated will reduce the overall risk of disease, but may not necessarily> render the supply safe.”Faecally-contaminated water will certainly induce illness; faeces are wastematter that, if ingested, will be rejected by the body through vomiting ordiarrhoea, or both, but these are natural processes, not ‘diseases’.The reason that the WHO claims water is not necessarily made ‘safe’ is due, inpart, to the idea that some ‘pathogens’ are resistant to some disinfectants; theerroneous nature of this idea has been discussed. The real reason that water isnot made ‘safe’ by disinfection is because the chemicals used are toxic; theyclearly cause the water to become ‘poisoned’.Water FluoridationFluorine and chlorine are two of a group of five closely-related chemicalelements called halogens. The closeness of the relationship between them meansthat fluorine and chlorine have many properties in common, the most significantof which are that they are both corrosive, reactive and toxic, and that neitherof them occurs in nature in their elemental gaseous form. However, unlike waterchlorination, water fluoridation is not practised in all countries; only a smallpercentage of the world population receives artificially fluoridated water,although there are efforts to expand this practice.Fluorine and chlorine are both claimed to have ‘antibacterial’ properties, butwater fluoridation is used to serve a different purpose. The addition offluoride to water supplies is based on the claim that it helps to reduce toothdecay, but this is yet another false claim.Water fluoridation was first introduced in 1945 in the North American city ofGrand Rapids, Michigan, where the inhabitants were the subjects of the initialhuman trial. The purpose of the experiment was to study the effects of fluorideon children’s teeth and to compare the results with the condition of children’steeth in Muskegon, Michigan, where water was not fluoridated. This experiment isclaimed to have shown that water fluoridation improves children’s dental health;these results have been used to justify the introduction of water fluoridationinto most parts of the US, where, according to the CDC web page entitled WaterFluoridation Data & Statistics,> “In 2014, 74.4% of the U.S. population on public water systems, or a total of> 211,393,167 people, had access to fluoridated water.”Although fluoride is claimed to be beneficial, it is also recognised to beharmful; as indicated by the WHO web page entitled Inadequate or excessfluoride, which claims that fluoride has both beneficial and negative effectsbut that,> “The ranges of intakes producing these opposing effects are not far apart.”The claim that fluoride produces beneficial effects is, however, totallyunfounded; fluoride only produces negative effects on teeth and on health.The history of fluoride and its industrial applications is recounted byChristopher Bryson in his book entitled The Fluoride Deception. In particular herelates that, in the 1930s in Denmark, Dr Kaj Roholm MD discovered that workerswho processed cryolite to extract aluminium suffered from multiple cripplingailments that mainly occurred in their bones, but also affected their centralnervous systems. Cryolite is sodium hexafluoroaluminate, a major component ofwhich is fluoride. Dr Roholm concluded from his investigations that the cryoliteworkers’ health problems were caused by their exposure to fluoride; he calledtheir condition ‘fluorine intoxication’.Christopher Bryson explains that the theory that fluoride was beneficial forteeth was first posited, although without any supportive evidence, as early asthe 19th century. He also refers to a 1925 rat-feeding study, the results ofwhich refuted the theory; this study demonstrated that fluoride weakened teeth,not strengthened them. Christopher Bryson reports that Dr Roholm made the samediscovery,> “The workers’ teeth he studied were bad, and the worst teeth had the most> fluoride in them.”Aluminium is one of the most abundant elements in the Earth, but, like manyother elements, it only occurs within an ore, from which it must be extracted.Although originally extracted from cryolite, aluminium is now mainly extractedfrom bauxite. The reason for this change is due to the depletion of cryolitedeposits. The extraction of aluminium from bauxite still utilises cryolite,which, although now a manufactured substance, inevitably contains fluoride;aluminium extraction processes therefore still produce fluoride as a by-product.Another industry that produces a significant volume of fluoride as a by-productis the phosphate fertiliser industry; the rock phosphate used as feedstock forthe production of fertiliser contains a concentration of fluoride that rangesbetween 2 to 4 per cent.The wastes discharged by the phosphate fertiliser industry originally caused asignificant level of environmental damage; as discussed in a May 2003 articleentitled, The Phosphate Fertilizer Industry: An Environmental Overview, in whichthe author, Michael Connett of the Fluoride Action Network (FAN), states,> “In the past when the industry let these gases escape, vegetation became> scorched, crops destroyed, and cattle crippled.”The article reports that the damage caused by the toxic emissions of thephosphate fertiliser industry during the 1950s and 1960s was so severe thatlocal communities pressured the industry to implement measures to reduce them.The action taken by the industry involved the installation of pollution capturedevices, called ‘wet scrubbers’.The processes that convert phosphate rock to fertiliser produce wastes in theform of toxic silicofluorides. Although fluoride was useful for a number ofindustrial processes, the presence of silica in the wastes was a seriousobstacle to their sale because the costs involved in removing silica rendered ituneconomical. But the toxicity of fluoride presented the industry with anotherdifficulty, the disposal of the wastes captured by the ‘scrubbers’; Dr RussellBlaylock explains,> “Because of its intense corrosive ability and extreme toxicity, disposal of> fluoride had, up until that time, been a very expensive and controversial> proposition.”Fortunately for the industry, this difficulty was solved by the suggestion thatthese silicofluorides, which include fluorosilicic acid, could be utilised forwater fluoridation, as explained on the FAN web page entitled FluoridationChemicals,> “Until recently, all fluoridation chemicals were obtained from the wet> scrubbing systems of the phosphate fertilizer industry in Florida.”The current source of fluoridation chemicals used in the US is reported on theFAN web page to be China, where regulations are reputed to be more lax. However,although Chinese industry is said to be poorly regulated, the fluoridationchemicals obtained from the wastes of the US phosphate fertiliser industry canalso be contaminated by toxic materials, such as arsenic. Another commoncontaminant is uranium, which occurs naturally, although in varyingconcentrations, within phosphate rock.The existence of ‘regulations’ does not ensure ‘safety’; this is demonstrated bythe fact that the EPA supported the use of toxic wastes from the phosphatefertiliser industry as the appropriate material to use in water fluoridation.The position of the EPA is made clear on the FAN web page about FluoridationChemicals that provides an extract from, and a link to a copy of, a letterwritten in 1983 by a senior EPA official; the letter states,> “In regards to the use of fluosilicic acid as a source of fluoride for> fluoridation, this Agency regards such use as an ideal environmental solution> to a long-standing problem.”Fluosilicic acid is another name for fluorosilicic acid.That the EPA would consider the use of toxic waste by-products to be an ‘ideal’solution to an environmental problem is outrageous; the purpose of the EPA, asindicated by its name, is to protect the environment, not permit it to bepoisoned.The proposal to add fluoride to the US water system was opposed by manyscientists and doctors who were aware of fluoride’s toxicity; this oppositionwas originally endorsed by the ADA (American Dental Association), as indicatedby Dr Blaylock, who quotes from the 1944 journal, in which the ADA referred tofluoride and concluded that,> “...the potential for harm outweighed those for good.”The ADA has, however, reversed their position since 1944; the ADA web pageentitled Fluoride in Water claims that water fluoridation,> “…is safe and effective in preventing tooth decay…”The promulgation of this claim by the ADA means that dentists are misinformed bythe organisation responsible for their education; a situation that mirrors thatof medical practitioners who are similarly misinformed by the organisationresponsible for their education. The problems with dentistry are furtherdiscussed later in this chapter; the problems with medical education arediscussed in chapter nine.The idea that water fluoridation would help to prevent tooth decay was also aboon for the sugar industry, as it deflected attention away from evidence thatshowed sugar to be one of the main causes of tooth decay. Although the correctsolution is to avoid sugar, the ‘germ theory’ was yet again invoked as it wasclaimed that bacteria were the cause of dental caries and that fluoride, whichwas toxic to bacteria, would assist in solving that problem. But fluoride ishighly toxic, as Dr Blaylock explains,> “It is essential to remember that fluoride is so reactive it can eat through> steel, glass, iron, aluminium and most other substances: it joins mercury as> being one of the most poisonous substances on earth.”Its inherently toxic nature is demonstrated by some of the main industrialapplications of fluoride, which Dr George Waldbott MD discusses in his 1978 bookentitled Fluoridation: The Great Dilemma,> “Commercially, their only outlets were insecticides and rodenticides.”One fluoride-based pesticide is compound 1080 (sodium fluoroacetate), which isextensively used to control ‘pests’ such as rodents; this toxic compound wasmentioned in the discussion about myxomatosis in chapter five.Despite its highly toxic nature, fluoride has another, more surprising,industrial application; Dr Waldbott explains,> “Simultaneously, the pharmaceutical industry discovered that fluorine> reinforces the action of many molecules.”The result of this ‘discovery’ is that an estimated 20 to 30 per cent, ofpharmaceutical drugs contain organofluorine compounds; their perceived mechanismof action includes certain functions, one of which is to slow the speed of drugmetabolism; this function is also claimed to improve the drug’s bioavailability.Some of the drugs that contain fluorinated compounds include: anti-canceragents, antidepressants, anti-inflammatory agents and anaesthetics.The FAN web page entitled Sources of Fluoride contains a section aboutPharmaceuticals, which states that consumption of most of the drugs that containfluorinated compounds will not increase exposure to fluoride. It is claimed thatthese drugs do not increase the intake of fluoride due to the tight bond betweenthe fluorine and carbon atoms; this bond is said to resist metabolic processesthat would release the fluoride ion.However, the body will recognise pharmaceuticals that contain fluoridatedcompounds as toxic and attempt to expel them, but if these natural eliminationprocesses are impeded, the body burden of toxins will increase, which willexacerbate health problems, not resolve them.In common with many toxic chemicals, fluoride is widely used in manyapplications; although some have been discussed, Christopher Bryson provides anumber of examples,> “We are exposed to fluorine chemicals from often-unrecognized sources, such as> agricultural pesticides, stain-resistant carpets, fluorinated drugs, and such> wrapping as microwavable popcorn bags and hamburger wrappers, in addition to> industrial air pollution and the fumes and dust inhaled by many workers inside> their factories.”One major difference between fluoride and chloride is that the latter isrequired by the body, whereas there is no evidence that fluoride plays any rolein the body’s biochemical processes. Although the WHO Water Guidelines reportacknowledges that there is no recognised role for fluoride within the humanbody, it is tempered by the statement that,> “Fluoride may be an essential element for humans; however, essentiality has> not been demonstrated unequivocally.”In his April 2012 article entitled Fluoride and Biochemistry, Dr Paul ConnettPhD discusses the lack of evidence that fluoride plays any role in the humanbody and states,> “...there are no known biochemical processes that need the presence of the> fluoride ion to function properly.”The article also states that some of the first opponents to water fluoridationwere biochemists, who used fluoride for experimental purposes because it wasknown to act as a poison. In his article, Dr Connett quotes the words ofbiochemist Dr James Sumner, who stated in the 1950s that,> “Everybody knows fluorine and fluorides are very poisonous substances and we> use them in enzyme chemistry to poison enzymes, those vital agents in the> body.”Dr Sumner won a Nobel Prize in 1946 for his work on enzyme chemistry.In his August 2012 article entitled Fluoride is not an Essential Element MichaelConnett states categorically that,> “It is now known that fluoride is not a nutrient.”Despite the efforts of the WHO to suggest that fluoride ‘may be’ an essentialelement for the human body, the Water Guidelines report recognises fluoride tobe a water contaminant of a similarly toxic nature to arsenic; as indicated inthe reference to,> “...key chemicals responsible for large-scale health effects through> drinking-water exposure (e.g. arsenic, fluoride, lead, nitrate, selenium and> uranium) ...”This recognition of fluoride’s toxicity is in direct contradiction to the ideathat fluoride is capable of protecting teeth from decay or is able to confer any‘beneficial’ effects.The idea that a tiny amount of fluoride is beneficial owes its existence to theParacelsus fallacy, and is the basis for the reduction in 2015 of theconcentration of fluoride added to the US water supply; it is claimed that theprevious level had been ‘too high’.It should be clear that fluoride is toxic and should not be added to the watersupply in any concentration; fluoride is, in fact, a major source of ‘poisoned’water.More Water PoisonsThe Water Guidelines report states that,> “Access to safe drinking-water is essential to health, a basic human right and> a component of effective policy for health protection.”Although access to water is a major problem for many people in certain regionsof the world, the more fundamental problem, which affects everyone, is waterquality.The previous two sections have shown that, in countries where water isaccessible through public water systems, the quality of the water delivered topeople has almost invariably been compromised by ‘treatment’ with chlorine-baseddisinfectants to destroy ‘germs’; in certain areas, fluoride ‘treatments’exacerbate the problem and further compromise water quality. Other discussionsin this chapter have indicated that most bodies of fresh water have become‘contaminated’; but, contrary to the information promulgated by the medicalestablishment, ‘germs’ are not contaminants.The most significant factors that contribute to water pollution are toxicindustrial wastes; a problem that is recognised by the EPA web page entitledIndustrial Wastewater, which states that,> “Wastewater discharges from industrial and commercial sources may contain> pollutants at levels that could affect the quality of receiving waters or> interfere with publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) that receive those> discharges.”The EPA has created a programme called NPDES (National Pollutant DischargeElimination System) to ‘control’ the discharge of industrial wastes into localwaterways by setting ‘discharge limits’ for each type of industry. This approachis clearly based on the idea that low levels of toxins are ‘safe’; but it failsto recognise that multiple industrial discharges into the same body of water areextremely likely to exceed the limits deemed to be ‘safe’. The EPA recognisesthat different industrial operations produce different volumes of wastes ofvarying degrees of toxicity and sets industry-specific guidelines. Twoindustries specifically referred to by the EPA are mining and oil and gasextraction, both of which have been discussed and shown to be significantsources of water pollution.AFOs (Animal Feeding Operations) are another group of industrial operations thatpollute the environment, especially local sources of water. A 2015 Food andWater Watch report entitled Factory Farm Nation refers to the huge growth in theUS of large factory farms, also called CAFOs (Concentrated Animal FeedingOperations), and states that they,> “…produce millions of gallons of manure that can spill into waterways from> leaking storage lagoons or fields where manure is over-applied to soil.”Although manure is often regarded as a good source of fertiliser for the soil,the wastes from CAFOs invariably contain a variety of contaminants, whichinclude large volumes of antibiotics that are routinely used to ‘treat’ animals;the report states that,> “…most industrial livestock facilities treat the animals with low levels of> antibiotics to try to prevent illness and compensate for stressful> conditions.”Previous discussions have demonstrated that antibiotics are unable to prevent‘infections’, or any other illness; they are, however, eminently capable ofcausing ill-health for animals as well as humans. In Seeds of Destruction,William Engdahl refers to the repeal by the EPA of a rule that had formerly heldcorporate livestock owners liable for pollution caused by animal wastes; he addsthat,> “The EPA also dropped a requirement that would have forced facilities to> monitor groundwater for potential contamination by animal waste, which often> seeped into the earth, leaving communities vulnerable to potentially dangerous> drinking water supplies.”This is clearly another example of the failure of the EPA to protect theenvironment.The chemical industry also contributes substantially to water pollution, bothdirectly, via wastes produced from the manufacture of chemicals, and indirectly,via wastes produced by other industries that utilise chemicals in themanufacture of their own products, many of which are used on a daily basis. Theuse and disposal of products by the general public also contribute toenvironmental pollution, including water pollution. These direct and indirectsources are acknowledged by the Water Guidelines report that states,> “Chemicals from industrial sources can reach drinking-water directly from> discharges or indirectly from diffuse sources arising from the use and> disposal of material and products containing the chemicals.”One group of chemicals that are of particular concern are POPs (persistentorganic pollutants), which are discussed on the EPA web page entitled PersistentOrganic Pollutants: A Global Issue, A Global Response that states,> “Many POPs were widely used during the boom in industrial production after> World War II when thousands of synthetic chemicals were introduced into> commercial use.”Nevertheless, the EPA acknowledges that,> “These same chemicals, however, have had unforeseen effects on human health> and the environment.”To call the effects ‘unforeseen’ is disingenuous; had these chemicals beenthoroughly tested prior to their introduction into commercial use, their natureas both toxic and persistent would have been discovered. This is not, however, aproblem that only affects the US; POPs are indeed a ‘global issue’, their use isglobal and their effects are global.A group of twelve POPs are referred to as the ‘dirty dozen’ due to theirparticularly toxic and persistent properties; this group includes pesticidessuch as aldrin, chlordane, dieldrin and heptachlor. It should be noted that allof the ‘dirty dozen’ are organochlorines, although they are not all pesticides.Another member of this group is TCDD, the most toxic member of the dioxinfamily. The persistence of dioxins in the human body is revealed by the October2016 WHO fact sheet entitled Dioxins and their effects on human health, whichstates that,> “Their half-life in the body is estimated to be 7 to 11 years.”Pesticides, whether used to kill insects, plants or animals, are recognised tobe toxic and capable of contaminating sources of fresh water. However,pesticides, and particularly insecticides, are deemed to be necessary, asdiscussed in the Water Guidelines report,> “The diseases spread by vectors are significant causes of morbidity and> mortality. It is therefore important to achieve an appropriate balance between> the intake of the pesticides from drinking-water and the control of> disease-carrying insects.”The most common ‘vectors’ are mosquitoes, which live near and breed in water;this means that mosquito-killing insecticides will be applied into or aroundbodies of water in which these insects are found. But insecticides are notspecific to mosquitoes; they will poison all organisms, including people, thatlive in or rely on, the bodies of fresh water to which insecticides are applied.Yet again, the ‘germ theory’ provides the justification for the use of toxicchemicals to ‘control’ vectors that are claimed to transmit pathogenicmicroorganisms. The October 2017 WHO fact sheet entitled Vector-borne diseasesclaims that,> “The growth of urban slums, lacking reliable piped water or adequate solid> waste management can render large populations in towns and cities at risk of> viral diseases spread by mosquitoes.”The Water Guidelines report claims that the most significant type of virus thatcauses such diseases are enteric viruses, which,> “…infect the human gastrointestinal tract and are predominantly transmitted by> the faecal-oral route.”Previous discussions have demonstrated that no diseases, including diarrhoea andsimilar gastrointestinal problems, are caused by viruses, nor are they caused byany other so-called ‘germ’. Faeces, whether human or animal, are waste materialsthat the human body will recognise as ‘toxic’ and attempt to reject as quicklyas possible, often producing diarrhoea and vomiting, both of which are naturalmechanisms; the ingestion of water contaminated by toxic insecticides will alsoproduce these symptoms.Another significant member of the ‘dirty dozen’ isdichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane, more commonly known as DDT. The EPA web pageabout POPs describes DDT as both ‘controversial’ and ‘effective’; it also refersto the health and environmental damage caused by this toxic pesticide, which wasdocumented by Rachel Carson in her seminal book Silent Spring. Although listedas a member of the ‘dirty dozen’ and banned in many countries, DDT remains oneof the main tools used in the battle against mosquitoes in malaria-endemicregions of the world. As previously discussed, the ban on the use of DDT was notuniversally applied; DDT remained in use in certain countries, where itcontinued to contribute to health problems.The WHO web page entitled Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) recognises that‘low level exposures’ can lead to health problems that include increased cancerrisk, increased birth defects and neurobehavioural impairment. The page alsostates that,> “POPs bio-magnify throughout the food chain and bio-accumulate in organisms.”The ‘organisms’ highest on the food chain, which include humans who consumeanimal-based foods, will therefore suffer the greatest accumulation of POPs; yetfood production often involves the use of a variety of chemicals, includingPOPs. As discussed, the ‘Green Revolution’ promoted the idea that agriculturalpractices should increase the use of synthetic chemicals. Although nitrate is asoil nutrient, synthetic nitrate fertilisers are not ‘natural’; they arepollutants that often leach from the soil and contaminate water sources, asexplained by a Soil Association report entitled Just Say N2O: From manufacturedfertiliser to biologically-fixed nitrogen that states,> “Nitrate leaching can lead to eutrophication and acidification in fresh> waters, estuaries and coastal zones…”There are far too many water-contaminating chemicals to discuss them all; theWater Guidelines report lists more than 100 substances under the sub-headingChemical contaminants in drinking water. It should be noted that this listincludes: aluminium, arsenic, asbestos, barium, benzene, cadmium, cyanide,fluoride, formaldehyde, lead, mercury, toluene and uranium; these are some ofthe most toxic and dangerous substances known to science and none of them shouldbe present in water that has been deemed to be ‘safe’ for drinking.Radioactive materials, such as uranium and its decay products, clearly presentextremely serious health hazards, as the Water Guidelines report acknowledges,> “Drinking-water may contain radioactive substances (‘radionuclides’) that> could present a risk to human health.”Despite recognition of the health risk, the report continues with the statementthat,> “These risks are normally small compared with the risks from microorganisms> and chemicals that may be present in drinking-water.”This is grossly misleading; the ‘risk’ from microorganisms is zero, as has beendiscussed. There are certainly health risks from ingesting chemicals. Thediscussion about ionising radiation demonstrated that there is no ‘safe’ levelof exposure; the risks from ingesting water contaminated with radionuclidescannot be regarded as small.The health hazards due to ‘medicines’ have been discussed, especially in thesection about iatrogenesis; however, pharmaceuticals also pose a direct threatto water; as Dr Carolyn Dean states in Death by Modern Medicine,> “One astounding fact about our overuse of medications is that every body of> water tested contains measurable drug residues.”In addition, she states that,> “Following that abuse are the tons of drugs and drug metabolites that are> flushed down our toilets making their way around the world and ending up in> our drinking water.”The ‘astounding fact’ that water is contaminated by huge volumes ofpharmaceutical drugs is supported by the findings of a US Geological Surveystudy discussed by the NRDC in their December 2009 White Paper entitled DosedWithout Prescription: Preventing Pharmaceutical Contamination of our Nation’sDrinking Water. In this paper, the NRDC reports that the Survey team,> “...found organic wastewater contaminants and pharmaceuticals in 80 percent of> sampled sites – including antibiotics, hypertensive and cholesterol-lowering> drugs, antidepressants, analgesics, steroids, caffeine and reproductive> hormones.”This situation is not unique to the US; it will exist in every country in whichpharmaceutical drugs are consumed. Another significant source of water pollutionby pharmaceutical drugs involves the operations of the pharmaceutical industryitself, as the NRDC White Paper states,> “The amount and variety of waste created during the manufacture of> pharmaceuticals dwarfs the amount of the actual finished product.”The ever-greater variety of chemicals that continue to be developed, used anddischarged into the environment continue to exacerbate water pollution, asindicated by the EPA on a web page entitled Contaminants of Emerging Concernincluding Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products that states,> “Contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), including pharmaceuticals and> personal care products (PPCPs), are increasingly being detected at low levels> in surface water…”This situation had been anticipated by Rachel Carson who wrote in Silent Springthat,> “Ever since chemists began to manufacture substances that nature never> invented, the problems of water purification have become complex and the> danger to users of water has increased.”It is, however, a situation that has substantially worsened due to the thousandsof new chemicals that have been produced and introduced onto the market sincethe 1960s. The refusal to acknowledge that it is not ‘germs’ but toxic chemicalsthat pose the greatest threat to human health, permits the chemical industry tocontinue polluting and contaminating the environment, including vital sources offresh water.Water purification can no longer be described as merely ‘complex’; it is widelyrecognised that most water treatment plants are unable to remove the vastmajority of chemicals; which means that ‘treated’ water remainschemically-polluted. Nevertheless, this ‘treated’ water may be returned to thewater system. A November 2013 article entitled Only Half of Drugs Removed bySewage Treatment refers to a report, which revealed that the ‘treatment’ ofeffluent subsequently discharged into the Great Lakes had failed to remove sixchemicals, which were,> “…an herbicide, an anti-seizure drug, two antibiotic drugs, an antibacterial> drug and an anti-inflammatory drug.”The concentration of these chemicals is reported to have been ‘low’, but thatdoes not mean that they pose no threat; as repeatedly stated, low doses of toxicsubstances are not ‘safe’.Although regulatory agencies set a ‘safety limit’ for the concentration of eachchemical, these are often breached, as indicated by an August 2016 press releaseentitled Unsafe levels of toxic chemicals found in drinking water for sixmillion Americans. This press release, issued by the Harvard School of PublicHealth states that,> “Levels of a widely used class of industrial chemicals linked with cancer and> other health problems – polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs)> – exceed federally recommended safety levels in public drinking water> supplies.”Clearly, the existence of regulations does not guarantee that they will beimplemented. However, even if fully complied with, regulations that limit theamount of each chemical discharged by each industry will not solve the problem,because industrial wastes contain multiple chemicals in varying combinations,none of which has ever been tested for the level at which they can be deemed‘safe’.Furthermore, the failure to test all combinations of all chemicals means thatby-products of chemical interactions are entirely incapable of detection; theireffects remain unknown and unknowable. Peter Montague’s comment in his 1999article about risk assessment, which was quoted at the beginning of the chapter,deserves repetition,> “Science has no way to analyze the effects of multiple exposures…”Rachel Carson made a similar comment with specific reference to organicchemicals; she states that,> “The chemist who guards water purity has no routine tests for these organic> pollutants and no way to remove them.”The degree to which drinking water is contaminated by toxic substances willdepend on where people live; however, water is a vital resource for everyonewherever they live. Water is essential for all forms of life on planet Earth; itis far too important a resource to be contaminated, polluted and poisoned.Poisoned BodiesPrevious discussions have shown that ‘poisons’ can be absorbed into the bodythrough ingestion, injection and inhalation; there is, however, a furtherpathway through which poisons can be absorbed into the body. Although the skinhas been referred to as an organ of elimination, the process operates in bothdirections; in other words, the skin can absorb toxic substances as well aseliminate them.The IPCS (International Programme on Chemical Safety) is a collaboration betweenthe WHO, ILO (International Labour Organisation) and UNEP (United NationsEnvironmental Programme) that, in 2006, produced a report entitled DermalAbsorption; a term that is used to describe,> “...the transport of chemicals from the outer surface of the skin both into> the skin and into the systemic circulation.”The skin is the body’s largest organ; it has three layers. The outermost layer,called the epidermis, acts as a waterproof barrier that can nevertheless permitthe transport of substances into other layers and into the systemic circulation;which enables toxic chemicals to enter the bloodstream.Although the report claims that skin permeability is variable, Dr Samuel EpsteinMD states in his book entitled Toxic Beauty that the skin is ‘highly permeable’;he also explains that toxic substances absorbed into the body through the skincan be more harmful than if they had been ingested. The reason for this isbecause the digestive system carries ingested substances into the liver wherethey can be processed and detoxified by enzymes. But these enzymatic processesare bypassed when toxic substances are absorbed through the skin. It should benoted that these enzymatic processes are also bypassed when toxic substances areinjected into the body, whether injections are administered intradermally,intramuscularly or subcutaneously.In 2014 the IPCS published a further report entitled Dermal Exposure, whichrecognises that health hazards can arise from skin exposures to toxic substancesand states,> “Diseases resulting from dermal exposure (and consequently absorption) may> have a significant impact on human health.”Specific chemicals do not cause specific ‘diseases’ per se; as will be discussedin chapter ten. However, the report recognises that chemicals can cause variousdegrees of damage and states that,> “Dermal exposure can lead to local damage to the skin and/or systemic effects> after crossing the skin barrier…”The report also recognises the variety of products in which chemicals can befound,> “Dermal exposure has been identified as an important exposure route, as people> are exposed to a variety of substances and products either directly or> indirectly while at work, in the home or in public facilities.”The report claims that ‘skin diseases’ are the second most frequent type ofoccupational health problem; it also claims that the second highest incidence ofoccupational health problems occurs in manufacturing workers. Although there isa huge variety of chemical-based products utilised for industrial purposes, sometypes are more common.One group of widely-used products are organic solvents, which have a number ofapplications that range from degreasing agents to ingredients of paints,varnishes, adhesives and glues. The chemical ingredients of solvents can includebenzene, formaldehyde and toluene, all of which have been discussed and shown tobe highly toxic and even carcinogenic. Solvents also contain chemicals that arevolatile, which means that they can be inhaled and cause respiratory problems,as discussed in the section about fracking. Some of the solvent chemicals arelipophilic; which means that they dissolve in fats or oils and, if they crossthe skin barrier, the report states that they,> “…may become systemically available in considerable amounts.”The highly toxic nature of some of these chemicals means that ‘considerableamounts’ can lead to extremely serious health problems.NIOSH (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) is part of the CDCand responsible, as its name implies, for health and safety in the workplace.The NIOSH section of the CDC website includes a page entitled Skin Exposures andEffects which recognises that,> “Dermal exposure to hazardous agents can result in a variety of occupational> diseases and disorders, including occupational skin diseases (OSD) and> systemic toxicity.”Contact dermatitis, which is said to be a type of eczema, is claimed to be oneof the most common skin diseases, the symptoms of which can include irritation,dryness and inflammation. It is incorrect to refer to these symptoms as a‘disease’ when they are recognised to have resulted from exposures to hazardoussubstances; eczema is discussed further in chapter seven.The toxic ingredients of industrial products can result in far greater healthhazards than irritation, dryness and inflammation of the skin; as recognised bythe reference to systemic toxicity. However, other than a passing reference to‘skin cancer’, NIOSH fails to discuss the full extent of the potential adversehealth consequences that can result from the absorption of highly toxicchemicals into the bloodstream; chapter seven discusses cancer and many of itscauses.The Dermal Exposure report acknowledges that exposure to toxic substances is notlimited to occupational environments, although non-occupational exposuresinvolve different products; the report states that,> “…people can be dermally exposed to chemicals in a variety of chemical classes> through use of a diverse range of consumer products. Most relevant types of> products include personal care products and cosmetics, textiles (including> shoes) and household products…”A number of consumer products and their toxic ingredients are discussed in theensuing sections; however, in common with all other chemicals, the determinationof their ‘safe use’ in consumer products is based on risk assessment, asindicated by the Dermal Absorption report that states,> “Risk assessments are usually performed to determine the extent to which> exposure to a particular substance is acceptable and therefore the extent to> which the substance is safe to use.”The claim that risk assessments ensure that people are never exposed to harmful‘doses’ of any toxic substance has been repeatedly shown to be unfounded, as DrEpstein asserts in Toxic Beauty,> “The poison is only in the dose, they tell us, and claim (falsely) that the> doses to which we are exposed are too low to be harmful.”Surprisingly, however, the Dermal Absorption report makes a significantadmission, which is that,> “For many chemicals, there is no information on dermal absorption.”This means that the medical establishment has a poor level of knowledge aboutthe full extent of the potential health effects from the absorption of chemicalsthrough the skin. Despite this paucity of knowledge, the ‘safe’ level of asubstance used in consumer products is determined by reference to the NOAELestablished through experimentation that, in the vast majority of cases, onlyinvestigates each substance individually. This is acknowledged by a 2012 EUreport entitled Toxicity and Assessment of Chemical Mixtures, which states that,> “The EU Chemicals legislation, in common with the situation in other parts of> the world, is based predominantly on assessments carried out on individual> substances.”Although legislation and regulations in many countries are based on assessmentsof individual substances, the EU report recognises that, in the real world,people are exposed to multiple chemicals in many different combinations in thereference to,> “...the almost infinite number of possible combinations of chemicals to which> humans and environmental species are exposed...”Most people probably assume that consumer products that are intended for use onthe skin, or are likely to make direct contact with the skin, have been provensafe to use on the skin; this is yet another mistaken assumption. One of themain obstacles to a greater awareness of this problem is the lack of informationabout the ingredients provided on a product’s label. In Dr Epstein’s bookentitled The Politics of Cancer Revisited is an Appendix entitled Shopper Bewarein which he states,> “Consumers have an inalienable right to know what ingredients are in products> they use daily...”This problem is not one that can be solved by demanding that manufacturersprovide better information on product labels and include all of their chemicalingredients. The fundamental problem is that toxic chemicals are used in themanufacture of consumer products intended for use on the skin or are likely tomake contact with the skin.However, people do not have to use these products; in addition to the ‘right’articulated by Dr Epstein, is an even more basic ‘right’, which is the right notto be poisoned, which means that people can choose to purchase non-toxicproducts; or even create their own.Surprisingly the EPA has provided some suggested solutions, which are availableon the web page entitled Household Hazardous Waste (HHW),> “When shopping for items such as multipurpose household cleaners, toilet> cleaners, laundry detergent, dish soap, dishwashing machine pods and gels, bug> sprays and insect pest control, consider shopping for environmentally> friendly, natural products or search online for simple recipes you can use to> create your own.”Solutions to these and many other problems discussed in this book are exploredfurther in chapter ten.Household ProductsThe term ‘household products’ applies to a wide range of goods, from largeelectrical appliances to small consumable items. Although a range of differentmaterials are used in the manufacture of these products, some materials arecommon to a substantial proportion of them; metals and plastics, for example.The first synthetic plastic was developed in the early 20th century; theintervening century has, however, seen a phenomenal increase in theirmanufacture and use, the result of which is that plastics have becomeubiquitous. Plastics are entirely synthetic materials that are mostly, althoughnot exclusively, made from petrochemicals; they are used in a wide range ofapplications that extend from insulation for electrical wiring to baby toys;from hard plastics for device casings to soft plastics for food wrapping.The main advantage of plastics is said to be their stability, a quality thatensures their durability; unfortunately, their durability is also their maindisadvantage, because synthetic plastics are incapable of natural degradation,they are virtually indestructible and have become highly persistentenvironmental pollutants.There are many types of plastic; one of the most widely used is PVC (polyvinylchloride), a product of both the petrochemical and chlor-alkali industries. Likeall plastics, PVC is durable; it is also an extremely effective insulatingmaterial, which makes it ideal for use as protective covering for electricalwiring.Plastics have many applications, some of which require them to be solid andstrong, others of which require them to be soft and flexible. For the lattertype of application, plastics are required to undergo further treatment withchemicals called plasticisers. One of the most common group of plasticiserchemicals are members of the family of phthalates, which are alsopetrochemicals. Although they are mainly used as plasticisers, phthalates alsoperform other ‘functions’ and can be found in a wide variety of consumerproducts, as indicated by the FDA web page entitled Phthalates that states,> “Phthalates are a group of chemicals used in hundreds of products such as> toys, vinyl flooring and wall covering, detergents, lubricating oils, food> packaging, pharmaceuticals, blood bags and tubing, and personal care products> such as nail polish, hair sprays, aftershave lotions, soaps, shampoos,> perfumes and other fragrance preparations.”The plastics industry unsurprisingly claims that phthalates are ‘safe’; forexample, according to a PVC industry promotion website,> “Plasticised PVC has been used for over 50 years without a single known case> of it having caused any ill-health…”The FDA’s position on the safety of phthalates, by comparison, is rather vague,> “It’s not clear what effect, if any, phthalates have on human health.”These comments are disingenuous; there is ample evidence that demonstratesphthalates produce many adverse effects. A 2008 article entitled Environmentalphthalate exposure in relation to reproductive outcomes and other healthendpoints in humans indicates that phthalates, like all other chemicals, havenot been thoroughly tested; as the article states,> “Though the number of phthalates is large, many have not been examined in> humans.”The article refutes the claim that there are no adverse human health effectsfrom exposures to phthalates and states that,> “…evidence for significant impacts on human health is mounting.”These health impacts are a matter of serious concern, particularly as the FDAindicates that the medical establishment utilises plastics containing phthalatesin blood bags and tubing. Phthalates are also used in pharmaceuticals, in whichtheir main function is to act as excipients in drugs. According to the pageentitled Pharmaceutical Excipients on the American Pharmaceutical Reviewwebsite,> “Generally, an excipient has no medicinal properties. Its standard purpose is> to streamline the manufacture of the drug product and ultimately facilitate> physiological absorption of the drug.”The PVC industry website contains a page entitled PVC: The most widely usedpolymer in medical applications that lists some of the applications, whichinclude: inhalation masks, catheters and cannulae, and surgical and examinationgloves. All of these applications utilise softened plastics, which means theycontain plasticisers; and they all make direct contact with the skin or body ofmedical staff and patients.The FDA also lists food packaging as one of the uses of phthalates, one of themost common of which is called DEHP (di-2-ethylexyl phthalate). Phthalates havebeen increasingly recognised as endocrine disrupting chemicals and, in someinstances, have been replaced. One of the main chemicals introduced to replaceDEHP is a substance called DEHA (di-2-ethylhexyl adipate); however, in ThePolitics of Cancer Revisited, Dr Epstein states that,> “Cling film contains carcinogens such as di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) and> di-2-ethylhexyl adipate (DEHA), which will migrate into foods, especially> fatty foods.”The recognition that DEHA is also carcinogenic raises serious questions over itssuitability as a replacement chemical for DEHP; it is clearly not ‘safer’.Although not a member of the family of phthalates, adipates are similarlyderived from petrochemicals. Dr Theo Colborn also refers to the leaching ofphthalates on the page entitled Phthalates on the Our Stolen Future website,> “Now they are ubiquitous, not just in the products in which they are> intentionally used, but also as contaminants in just about anything.”In their March 2012 Phthalates Action Plan, the EPA claims that phthalateexposures have been associated with adverse health effects, but have not beenproven to directly cause ill-health problems; nevertheless, they state,> “EPA is concerned about phthalates because of their toxicity and the evidence> of pervasive human and environmental exposure to them.”Furthermore, the EPA’s TEACH (Toxicity and Exposure Assessment for Children’sHealth) programme has produced a document about phthalates that discusses someof the adverse effects reported by animal experiments and states,> “Exposure to phthalates has been reported to result in increased incidence of> developmental abnormalities such as cleft palate and skeletal malformations,> and increased fetal death in experimental animal studies.”Children are clearly vulnerable to toxic chemicals; however, pregnant women areparticularly vulnerable to endocrine disrupting chemicals, which can havedevastating effects on the developing baby; the endocrine system and itsimportance is discussed further in chapter seven.Another group of plastics that have been the subject of health concerns arepolycarbonate plastics; the reason for this concern is because they oftencontain a chemical called bisphenol A, also known as BPA. Plastics that containBPA have been used for food containers and baby bottles, as well as for theresin used in the inner lining of tins. Although BPA is widely recognised as anendocrine disrupting chemical, the FDA refers to it as,> “…safe at the current levels occurring in foods.”This statement suggests that at other levels BPA may not be ‘safe’; whichdemonstrates the reliance on the Paracelsus fallacy to permit the continuingmanufacture and use of products that nevertheless can and do cause adversehealth effects. In contrast to the view of the FDA, is that expressed by theECHA (European Chemicals Agency) on the web page entitled MSC unanimously agreesthat Bisphenol A is an endocrine disruptor; the title is self-explanatory. MSCrefers to the Member State Committee of the ECHA.Despite the position taken by the FDA, there has been a considerable degree ofpublicity in the US about the hazards of BPA and this has led to its removalfrom some plastic products. However, although plastic bottles may be promoted as‘BPA-free’, the chemicals used to replace it have not necessarily proven to be asafer option. A March 2011 article entitled Most Plastic Products ReleaseEstrogenic Chemicals: A Potential Health Problem That Can Be Solved states that,> “Almost all commercially available plastic products we sampled – independent> of the type of resin, product, or retail source – leached chemicals having> reliably detectable EA, including those advertised as BPA free.”EA means oestrogenic activity, (estrogenic is the American spelling). One of thechemicals introduced to replace BPA is called BHPF (fluorene-9-bisphenol), butthis is also associated with endocrine disruption; as indicated by a March 2017article entitled Fluorene-9-bisphenol is anti-oestrogenic and may cause adversepregnancy outcomes in mice; the title is self-explanatory.In addition to the materials with which many types of household goods andcontainers are manufactured, are the chemicals that comprise the ingredients ofconsumables, such as cleaning products for example. Every year the chemicalindustry produces large quantities of chemicals, unknown numbers of which arecontained in a profusion of products that have a multitude of purposes withinthe home. It may be assumed that, because these products are intended for usewithin the home, they have been thoroughly tested for their safety;unfortunately, yet again, nothing could be further from the truth.Fortunately, public awareness about the toxic ingredients of many everydayhousehold products is growing, as Dr Epstein explains,> “In the last few years consumers have discovered that some of the chemicals in> household products whose safety was taken for granted are hazardous.”One particular group of household products that contain hazardous chemicals are‘cleaning products’, which include a myriad of polishes, creams, liquids,sprays, lotions and potions to brighten, whiten, sparkle, gleam and otherwiseclean everything in the home, as well as an array of ‘fresheners’ to dispersethose ‘unwanted odours’. These products promise to make the chore of cleaningeasy, but this ease is achieved through the use of some extremely powerful, buthighly toxic chemicals. The extent of this problem is succinctly explained bythe Organic Consumers Association in an article entitled How Toxic Are YourHousehold Cleaning Supplies?> “In fact, some cleaners are among the most toxic products found in the home.”This article, which will be referred to as the OCA article, states that,> “In 2000, cleaning products were responsible for nearly 10% of all toxic> exposures reported to US Poison Control Centers, accounting for 206,636> calls.”The article reports that more than half of these calls related to childrenyounger than six years old. The adverse effects from exposure to the chemicalsin cleaning products can vary from mild irritation to chronic health problems,including cancer. Clearly, some chemicals are more dangerous than others;however, cleaning chemicals are rarely harmless. The OCA article quotes PhilipDickey of the Washington Toxics Coalition, who states that,> “The most acutely dangerous cleaning products are corrosive drain cleaners,> oven cleaners, and acidic toilet bowl cleaners.”The article also confirms that combinations of products can significantly add tothe dangers of the various toxic chemicals contained in each different product,> “Combining products that contain chlorine and ammonia or ammonia and lye (in> some oven cleaners) produces chloramines gases, while chlorine combined with> acids (commonly used in toilet bowl cleaners) forms toxic chlorine gas.”Chlorine is a common ingredient of bleach, which, together with ammonia are thetwo chemicals most often used as cleaning agents. In 1999, the NEJM (New EnglandJournal of Medicine) published an article entitled Severe Lung Injury afterExposure to Chloramine Gas from Household Cleaners, which also refers to theproduction of chloramine gas from the combination of ammonia and chlorine andexplains the effects,> “When inhaled, chloramines react with the moisture of the respiratory tract to> release ammonia (NH3), hydrochloric acid (HCl) and oxygen free radicals.”It should be noted that chloramines are also used as secondary waterdisinfectants on the basis of the claim that they are longer lasting; however,chloramines are not a ‘safer’ option for water disinfection. Chloramines canalso generate toxic by-products, a significant one of which is a chemical calledNDMA (N-Nitroso-dimethylamine) that is described in the March 2014 EPA TechnicalFact Sheet as a group B2 carcinogen; which means it is a ‘probable’ humancarcinogen. The fact sheet states that,> “NDMA is also an unintended by-product of the chlorination of wastewater and> drinking water at treatment plants that use chloramines for disinfection.”Exposures to the toxic chemicals used in cleaning products arise not only fromdirect contact with the skin but also from inhalation because many of thesechemicals are volatile as Dr Epstein explains,> “That means they become gaseous at room temperature or are sprayed from an> aerosol can or hand pump and this takes the form of microscopic particles that> are easily inhaled.”The inhalation of volatile toxic chemicals means that they are absorbed into therespiratory system where they can cause serious damage to the lungs.Another chemical of concern, and one that is also associated with cleaningproducts, is called 1,4-dioxane, which, despite its similar name, is not amember of the family of dioxins; it is, however, classified as a ‘probable’carcinogen. The Environmental Working Group (EWG) refers to it as a by-productand states that it has been found in products such as liquid laundry detergents,as indicated on the EWG web page entitled Cleaning Supplies and Your Health,> “Common cleaning ingredients can be laced with the carcinogenic impurity> 1,4-dioxane…”Some chemicals used as ingredients of household products have been withdrawnfrom use when they were discovered to be particularly hazardous; but theirreplacements have often been discovered to be similarly toxic, or in some casesmore so. It is common for the new formulation to be promoted as ‘new andimproved’, but the new ingredients may only have a different mechanism ofaction. It should be clear that ‘new and improved’ does not necessarily mean‘safer’.In addition to the chemicals that perform the task of ‘cleaning’ are theincreasing array of chemicals used in order to impart ‘fragrance’; thesechemicals include, amongst others, the ubiquitous family of phthalates. Some ofthe adverse effects caused by ‘fragrance’ chemicals are discussed in the OCAarticle,> “Fragrances added to many cleaners, most notably laundry detergents and fabric> softeners, may cause acute effects, such as respiratory irritation, headache,> sneezing and watery eyes in sensitive individuals or allergy and asthma> sufferers.”Although ‘sensitive individuals’ are more likely to suffer acute symptoms,‘non-sensitive’ people will also be affected by these toxic chemicals; chapterseven discusses sensitivity to chemicals.The OCA article also refers to the use of ‘trade secrets’ to prevent disclosureof fragrance chemicals, the consequences of which are that these ingredients arenot listed on the product label. The customer is only provided with limitedinformation, which may state that the product contains ‘fragrance’, ‘perfume’,or sometimes ‘parfum’; however, ‘fragrance’ chemicals are not restricted tohousehold cleaning products; they are widely used in cosmetics and personal careproducts, which are discussed in the next section.It is clear that one of the main problems for consumers is the lack ofinformation they are provided about all of the chemical ingredients of theproducts they purchase. This dearth of information is not restricted tofragrance chemicals, as Dr Epstein explains,> “Some leading household products do not disclose to the consumer that they> contain carcinogens...neurotoxins, such as formaldehyde...”The toxic chemical ingredients of cleaning products do not necessarily remain inthe home; they often enter the water or sewage systems; but as discussed, mostwater treatment plants are unable to remove most toxic chemicals. It istherefore not only their use, but their disposal that makes household productssignificant contributors to environmental pollution. The page entitled HouseholdHazardous Waste (HHW) on the EPA website refers to the ‘improper disposal’ ofhazardous substances and states that this includes pouring the chemicals intotoilets and drains, because,> “…improper disposal of these wastes can pollute the environment and pose a> threat to human health.”This point is not disputed; however, the EPA fails to recognise or mention thefar more important and fundamental problem, which is that industries arepermitted to manufacture and sell products that contain extremely hazardouschemicals that threaten not only the environment, but also human health; both ofwhich the EPA claims to protect.The foregoing clearly represents only a very small selection of the householdproducts that are used on a regular, if not daily basis; but they highlight theproblem that, by using these products, people are regularly exposed to highlytoxic and often dangerous chemicals that can and do adversely affect theirhealth.Cosmetics and Personal Care ProductsThe use of ‘cosmetics’ has a long history that, in some parts of the world,spans many millennia. However, a long history is not proof that a practice isinherently safe, particularly as some of the substances used in cosmeticsapplied to the face have been decidedly toxic. For example, during the periodbetween the 15th and 18th centuries, it was a custom for some European women toapply white lead to their faces and either cinnabar or red lead to their cheeks;cinnabar is mercury sulphide. Another example is the ancient Eastern practice ofapplying ‘kohl’ around the eyes; although different substances have been andstill are used, the traditional source of kohl was stibnite, which is theprimary ore of antimony, a toxic metalloid.The application of toxic materials to any part of the body is hazardous tohealth due to the skin’s permeability; the application of neurotoxic substances,such as mercury and lead, to the face poses even greater hazards to health dueto the close proximity of the brain and other vital organs in the head and neck.The rise of the chemical industry during the 19th and 20th centuries stimulatedthe replacement of natural materials with synthetic chemical compounds in anever-wider variety of applications, and this inevitably extended to the use ofchemicals in cosmetics, as Dr Epstein explains in Toxic Beauty,> “During the Roaring Twenties chemists further expanded the cosmetics industry> with their laboratory discoveries.”All statements attributed to Dr Epstein in this discussion are from ToxicBeauty, unless otherwise stated.The chemicals developed for use by the cosmetics industry in the early 20thcentury were treated in the same manner as those developed for other industrialpurposes; in other words, these chemicals were not subjected to rigorous safetytesting procedures prior to their release onto the market, despite the fact thatthey were intended for use in cosmetics products and that many of them would beapplied to the face. The enthusiasm of the cosmetics industry to exploit themarket and sell a wide range of new products seems to have outweighed anyconcerns about potential adverse health effects; as Dr Epstein states,> “Synthetics captured the imagination of manufacturers, and their advantages> helped blind the industry to any consideration of the unknown impact these> synthetic ingredients would have on health.”It was not just the industry that was blinded; Dr Epstein explains that, in theearly 1930s, certain eyelash and eyebrow colourants were manufactured fromaniline dyes, which are toxic coal-tar derivatives, and that these productsliterally blinded some of the women who used them.It would appear that the situation has changed in the intervening decades as thecosmetics and personal care products industry now asserts that the chemicalingredients used in their products undergo rigorous safety testing to ensurethat they are ‘safe’. However, the procedures employed for testing the safety ofthe chemical ingredients of these products are the same as those employed forall other applications of chemicals; their purpose is to determine a ‘safe levelof use’ for each individual ingredient.In addition to conducting tests of individual ingredients, the industry statesthat they also assess the ‘safety’ of the combination of ingredients in eachproduct, as indicated by a page entitled Science & Safety Information, on thewebsite of Cosmetics Info, that states,> “All ingredients are evaluated in the final product to confirm that their> actual use is within the safe range for both consumers and the environment.”The claim that the use of chemicals falls within a ‘safe range’ means that theremust also be an ‘unsafe range’ of these chemicals and that therefore they arenot absolutely safe. It is clear that the Paracelsus fallacy is again the basisfor the safety testing procedures and product evaluations that apply tocosmetics and personal care products. The idea that there can be a ‘safe’ doseof a toxic chemical or of a combination of toxic chemicals within a singleproduct ignores the situation in the real world, in which exposures are alwaysto multiple combinations of substances in multiple products.Despite assurances by the industry that their products have been tested andproven to be ‘safe’ for their intended use, the Dermal Exposure reportacknowledges that direct skin contact is a recognised source of exposure tochemicals and that cosmetics and personal care products are relevant to suchexposures. The report also admits that these products,> “...can damage the skin’s function and eventually contribute to the risk of> ill-health.”Although promoted as enhancers of beauty, the reason that these products candamage the skin is due to the toxic nature of their chemical ingredients, andthe harsh manufacturing processes they undergo, some of which are described byDr Devra Davis in The Secret History of the War on Cancer,> “To make some of the chemicals that are widely used in personal care products,> toxic materials like ethylene oxide and propylene oxide are placed in oversize> pressure reactors and pushed to react with oils or with amines, while they> cook for a day.”It should be noted that propylene oxide has been categorised as reasonablyanticipated to be a human carcinogen and that the EPA lists ethylene oxide as aGroup B1 ‘probable’ human carcinogen.Some of the chemical ingredients of cosmetics and personal care products areused for purposes that are more akin to the ‘technological functions’ performedby food additives; for example, one of the additional purposes is‘preservation’. In common with all other preservative chemicals, those used incosmetics and personal care products are claimed to possess ‘antimicrobial’properties; which means that, by definition, they must be toxic. The chemicalsmost commonly used for this purpose belong to a group referred to as parabens,of which there are many different types. Dr Epstein refers to parabens andstates that they are,> “…the most common of all ingredients in cosmetics and personal-care products.> They are also widely used in foods and pharmaceuticals.”He adds that,> “Numerous studies over the last decade have shown that parabens pose weakly> estrogen-like effects.”Although described as ‘weak’ these effects cannot be dismissed as irrelevant, asthe discussion about the endocrine system in chapter seven will demonstrate.However, the FDA promulgates a different view of these chemicals and states ontheir web page entitled Parabens in Cosmetics that,> “At this time, we do not have information showing that parabens as they are> used in cosmetics have an effect on human health.”This statement is disingenuous in the light of Dr Epstein’s reference in his2009 book to the numerous studies that have shown parabens to demonstrateeffects on the endocrine system. But further studies have been conducted since2009 and they continue to demonstrate that parabens can cause adverse effects.One study is reported in a September 2010 article entitled Toxic effects of theeasily avoidable phthalates and parabens that refers to the use of parabens inanti-perspirants and states that,> “Their estrogenicity and tissue presence are a cause for concern regarding> breast cancer.”As the article indicates, phthalates are another group of toxic chemicals usedin many cosmetics and personal care products, including soaps, shampoos andperfumes. Dr Epstein explains that their function in these products is,> “…to increase their flexibility and to stabilise fragrances.”The phthalates used in cosmetics and personal care products include diethylphthalate (DEP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP),all of which are categorised on the TEDX website as endocrine disrupters;additionally, the IARC has classified DEHP as a Group 2B ‘possible’ humancarcinogen. Furthermore, the EU has banned the use of DBP and DEHP due toconcerns about their adverse health effects.In addition to products such as perfumes that are intended to deliver‘fragrance’, many cosmetics and personal care products also contain‘fragrances’, which are mostly chemical in nature, as Dr Epstein explains,> “The chemicals that give perfumes and fragrances their aromas are manufactured> in one of three ways: chemical synthesis from petrochemicals; chemical> modification of isolates from natural sources; or direct extraction from> natural sources.”He adds that,> “In various combinations, perfumes and fragrances use at least 5,000 different> ingredients, and about 95 percent of these are synthetic.”Although some are obtained from ‘natural sources’, the processes to which thesesubstances are subjected may substantially alter their nature to the extent thatthey may no longer bear any resemblance to their original state. These changescan significantly alter the way these processed chemicals function or even theway they react with other chemicals.Another toxic chemical extensively used in cosmetics and personal-care productsis formaldehyde, which, as discussed, is claimed by the medical establishmentand vaccine manufacturers to be endogenously produced. This claim is refuted,however, by the re-classification of formaldehyde by the IARC in 2006 to Group 1status; which means that it is a proven human carcinogen. In addition to thedirect use of formaldehyde, certain personal care products, including someintended to be used on babies and small children, contain chemicals that DrEpstein refers to as ‘formaldehyde releasers’, which he describes as some of themany ‘hidden carcinogens’ in these products.Triclosan is another preservative chemical claimed to have ‘antibacterial’properties. It was originally introduced in the 1970s and initially only used inhospitals and health-care facilities, but was subsequently introduced into awide range of consumer products, especially ‘antibacterial’ soaps andhandwashes. Triclosan is, however, an organochlorine and therefore not ‘safe’,as Dr Epstein explains,> “Triclosan interacts with free chlorine in tap water and degrades under> sunlight to produce chloroform.”Furthermore, in addition to the production of chloroform, which is categorisedas a ‘probable’ human carcinogen, triclosan poses other health hazards, as DrEpstein continues,> “It also produces a class of persistent, highly toxic, carcinogenic chemicals> known as dioxins...”Although triclosan is not a pesticide, the organisation Beyond Pesticides hasled a campaign to remove it from the market; their web page entitled Triclosanrefers to,> “...the mounting scientific evidence documenting adverse health effects,> including impacts to the thyroid hormone…”One of the results of the campaign has been that some manufacturers havevoluntarily removed triclosan from their products. Another major result has beenthat in September 2016 the FDA issued a rule, which establishes that,> “…over-the-counter (OTC) consumer antiseptic wash products containing certain> active ingredients can no longer be marketed.”The ingredients referred to include triclosan and triclocarban, amongst others;the reason for this rule is claimed to be because they are no better than soapand water for ‘preventing the spread of germs’. However, the FDA also admitsthat,> “In fact, some data suggests that antibacterial ingredients may do more harm> than good over the long-term.”It should be noted that the EU also removed their approval of triclosan in 2016.Although the removal of any toxic chemical is a ‘victory’ against the use of‘poisons’ in consumer products, it must be remembered that thousands ofchemicals remain on the market and that most of them have not been fully testedfor their safety, if at all, despite their use as ingredients of products thatare used on a daily basis by millions of people around the world.Many cosmetics and personal care products also contain chemicals that act asemulsifiers and foaming agents; these functions are important for liquidproducts such as shampoos, bodywashes and bubble baths, amongst others. Onechemical commonly used for these purposes is DEA (diethanolamine), which isacknowledged by the EPA to cause adverse effects,> “Acute inhalation exposure to diethanolamine in humans may result in> irritation of the nose and throat, and dermal exposure may result in> irritation of the skin.”Adverse health effects are not restricted to mere irritation; the IARCclassified DEA in 2013 as a Group 2B carcinogen, in other words, it is‘possibly’ carcinogenic to humans. Dr Epstein refers to DEA as one of threedetergents that are ‘common penetration enhancers’, because they,> “…facilitate the absorption of other ingredients through the skin by damaging> the skin to increase its permeability.”It should be clear that substances known to damage the skin should not beingredients of products intended for use on the skin.There is a variant of DEA called cocamide DEA that is promoted as beingnaturally derived from coconut oil; which suggests it is a ‘natural’ ingredient,but this is not the case. The coconut oil from which the chemical has beenderived is certainly natural; but this natural substance is then subjected tochemical processes that substantially alter its nature, as indicated by the IARCclassification of cocamide DEA in 2013 as a Group 2B ‘possible’ humancarcinogen.Other chemicals of concern that are used in cosmetics and personal careproducts, as well as in household products, include sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS)and sodium lauryl ether sulphate (SLES); the latter may also be referred to assodium laureth sulphate. The purpose of these chemicals is to act assurfactants, which means that they break the surface tension of the liquid toproduce a greater interaction between the products and the surfaces to whichthey are applied. These may be inanimate surfaces, such as kitchen worktops, orthey may be living surfaces, such as human skin. Dr Epstein explains that SLSand other harsh detergents are also penetration enhancers that, like DEA, damagethe skin and increase its permeability, which enables toxic chemicals to beabsorbed into the body and systemic circulation. He adds that these harshdetergents,> “...are invariably contaminated with high concentrations of the volatile and> carcinogenic ethylene dioxide and 1,4 dioxane…”In addition to their everyday use by the general public at home, cosmetics andpersonal care products are employed in a number of occupational settings; forexample, many different types of products are used on a daily basis bybeauticians and hairdressers. Another major consumer of cosmetics is theentertainment industry, in which many people, especially actors, are regularlyexposed to ‘make-up’ applied to the face. It should be noted that the people whoapply these products to actors are also exposed, although to a lesser extent, tothe chemical ingredients of these products.Regulatory bodies claim that responsibility for the safety of cosmetics andpersonal care products rests with the manufacturers. The industry claims thattheir products are thoroughly tested and proven to be ‘safe’ prior to theirrelease onto the market. Despite these claims, however, every year some productsare recalled for various reasons, which include the detection of toxicsubstances known to cause health hazards. Some of the detected toxic materialsinclude lead, mercury and antimony. An April 2017 article entitled Number ofcosmetic product recalls spikes 63% in 2016 was published on the CosmeticsBusiness website; the article states that,> “Using the European Commission’s rapid alert system for product notification> (RAPEX), SGS released its 2016 RAPEX Recalls report presenting the number of> recalls by country and product category.”The SGS report states that during 2016, 124 cosmetics and other chemicalproducts were recalled, which, although not a large number, neverthelessindicates that products claimed to be safe’ have subsequently been discovered tobe ‘unsafe’. The report shows that the products with the greatest number ofrecalls are in the category of bodywashes and cleansers. The Cosmetics Businessarticle adds that,> “Certain ingredients were highlighted in the report as being ‘frequently> implicated substances’.”These ‘frequently implicated’ substances are reported to include parabens,phthalates and formaldehyde, all of which have been shown in this discussion tobe toxic and hazardous to health; which raises the question of why thesehazardous chemicals continue to be permitted in consumer products.Two other chemicals common to a number of the products recalled aremethylisothiazolinone (MIT) and methylchloroisothiazolinone (CMIT); these areboth preservative chemicals that are claimed to possess ‘antibacterial’properties. The main hazard associated with their use is reported to be ‘contactdermatitis’, which is a clear indication that they are skin irritants. Thissituation raises serious concerns about the rationale behind the continued useof known skin irritants in products intended for use on the skin.It is clear that most cosmetics and personal care products contain a widevariety of chemical ingredients, many of which are toxic and known to causeadverse health effects; however, although there is increasing pressure byconcerned groups for all product ingredients to be fully listed on labels, thiswill not solve the problem; as Dr Epstein states,> “…product labelling per se is still inadequate to protect consumer health…”Consumer health can only be protected by the rejection of products that containtoxic ingredients. The recommendation by the EPA that people should find ways tosource non-toxic alternatives for household products should be extended to applyto cosmetics and personal care products. Safer alternatives are being producedand are becoming more readily available, as will be discussed in chapter ten.ClothesIt is disquieting to contemplate that the ordinary, everyday activity of wearingclothes could be a source of exposure to toxic chemicals; nevertheless, that isthe case, as acknowledged by the Dermal Exposure report, which, as previouslycited, includes textiles and shoes in the list of ‘relevant products’.Although the production of textiles has a long history, especially in countriessuch as India, the modern textile industry has its origins in the IndustrialRevolution; it was one of the first to benefit from the mechanisation processesdeveloped during that period of vast industrial expansion. The textile industryalso benefited from the creation of petrochemicals, some of which were the basicingredients used in the manufacture of synthetic fibres, the first of which wasnylon that began commercial production in 1939.The manufacture and use of synthetic fibres have increased phenomenally sincethe mid-20th century; according to the Statista website, the worldwideproduction of synthetic fibres was 5,000 tons in 1940; by 2015, the volume isreported to have increased to 62.9 million tons. Synthetic fibres are claimed topossess certain advantageous qualities, particularly durability, for which theyare increasingly developed and used in preference to natural fibres. It isclaimed that clothes manufactured using synthetic fibres are ‘safe’; but this isanother unfounded claim, as Dr Brian Clement PhD and Dr Anna Maria Clement PhDexplain in their book entitled Killer Clothes,> “Synthetic-fiber clothing is worn with an illusion of safety but hides> invisible chemical and other dangers that clothing manufacturers and much of> the world’s health-care industry ignores, or attempts to rationalize away.”Clothing made from synthetic fibres is also discussed by Nicholas Ashford and DrClaudia Miller in Chemical Exposures, in which they refer to some of the serioushealth effects that can be produced,> “Synthetic fabrics have been implicated in elevated blood pressure, increased> heart rate, arrhythmias, and angina.”This statement indicates that these conditions have causes other than thoseclaimed by the medical establishment; cardiovascular diseases are discussed inmore detail in chapter seven.Fortunately, there is an increasing level of awareness of the adverse impacts onthe environment due to the manufacture of clothing. Greenpeace, for example,produced two reports in 2012 about the use of toxic chemicals in the textile andclothing industries. The October 2012 report, entitled Toxic Threads: The BigFashion Stitch-Up, indicates the phenomenal output of the industry,> “Around 80 billion garments are produced worldwide, the equivalent of just> over 11 garments a year for every person on the planet.”The manufacture of clothing is not only a source of environmental pollution, italso poses hazards to human health, especially as the vast majority of the 80billion garments produced each year are manufactured utilising processes thatinvolve a huge number of chemicals, as indicated by a January 2008 articleentitled The A-Z of Eco Fashion that states,> “…at least 8,000 chemicals are used to turn raw materials into clothes…”The article adds that,> “Many of these cause irreversible damage to people and the environment.”The durability of synthetic fabrics is a contributory factor to one of theworld’s major environmental problems; non-biodegradable waste. The article citesthe example of polyester and states that it is,> “Non-biodegradable, it will be around for another 200 years or so.”The use of synthetic chemicals in the manufacture of textiles and clothing isnot restricted to the creation of durable fabrics; clothes are increasinglysubjected to a number of additional processes, for example ‘finishes’ that areclaimed to impart properties labelled as ‘easy care’, ‘water repellent’, and‘wrinkle free’, to name just a few. Although seemingly useful, these propertiesare accomplished solely through the use of chemicals, many of which are far frombenign, as indicated in the Eco Fashion article that states,> “The bleaching, dyeing, sizing and finishing of textiles all result in large> quantities of effluent often containing highly toxic heavy metals that pollute> the soil and water and damage aquatic life.”Heavy metals are by no means the only toxic substances in textile industryeffluent; for example, toxic organochlorines are formed as the result ofchlorine-based chemicals, such as sodium hypochlorite, that are used to bleachtextiles.One of the additional processes applied to some fabrics, especially those usedfor clothing manufactured for babies and small children, involve their treatmentwith ‘flame-retardant’ chemicals, but these do not prevent fires, as explainedin Killer Clothes,> “These chemicals delay ignition of products exposed to flames but don’t stop> fires, and at low temperature combustion, they release high levels of> brominated dioxins, which are toxic substances.”Some of the chemicals that have been used as flame retardants are called PBDEs(polybrominated diphenyl ethers), which are discussed on the EPA web pageentitled Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers (PBDEs) that states,> “EPA is concerned that certain PBDE congeners are persistent, bioaccumulative,> and toxic to both humans and the environment. The critical endpoint of concern> for human health is neurobehavioral effects.”The term ‘congener’ refers to related chemicals.Neurobehavioural effects are not the only issue of concern; there is evidencethat PBDEs produce a range of effects, some of which can occur at exposurelevels below those claimed to have been proven to be ‘safe’. A September 2003EWG article entitled Mother’s Milk: Health Risks of PBDEs refers to animalresearch studies that have,> “…linked PBDE exposure to an array of adverse health effects including thyroid> hormone disruption, permanent learning and memory impairment, behavioural> changes, hearing deficits, delayed puberty onset, decreased sperm count, fetal> malformations and, possibly, cancer.”A few different PBDE compounds have been produced and used, although in manycountries most have now been banned or voluntarily removed from use by themanufacturers due to their toxic nature. Nevertheless, these chemicals continueto pose health hazards and to be a source of environmental pollution due totheir persistent nature; PBDEs are now widely recognised as being ‘POPs’.The concerns about PBDEs has led to the introduction of a variety of otherflame-retardant chemicals to replace them; unfortunately, most of these otherchemicals have also been discovered to be toxic. Some of the chemicalsintroduced to replace PBDEs are chlorinated compounds; which means that theywill inevitably produce highly toxic carcinogenic dioxins when subjected tocombustion. A 2013 article entitled PBDEs and Their Replacements: Does theBenefit Justify the Harm concludes that,> “Flame-retardant chemicals can pose a potentially greater hazard to health and> environment than the risk of the fires they are supposed to prevent.”Flame-retardant chemicals are also used in home furnishing fabrics; however,although there is less direct skin contact with furniture than with clothes,these treated fabrics are nevertheless another source of exposure to toxicchemicals.As discussed, certain groups of chemicals have multiple applications; it istherefore unsurprising to discover that some of the chemical ingredients ofconsumer products have applications in the processes used to produce textilesand clothing; for example, finishes such as dyeing and printing. The DermalExposure report refers to some of these processes and states,> “Of toxicological interest are, in particular, those chemicals that are> involved in the dyeing and printing processes, optical brighteners and> chemical finishes.”The chemicals involved in dye printing include some members of the family ofphthalates, as explained in Killer Clothes,> “...the pigments in printing must be bound to the fabric with a polymer, and> the most commonly used plasticizers are a family of phthalates.”The subtitle of the October 2012 Greenpeace report is: How big brands are makingconsumers accomplices in the toxic water cycle; this report found thatphthalates can leak from printed images and states that,> “Phthalates in plastisol formulations are not tightly bound to the plastic and> can therefore be released from the product over time.”Although the main purpose of the Greenpeace report is to highlight the pollutionof water with toxic chemicals, the release of phthalates from clothing isanother source of dermal exposure to these poisons.Azo dyes are widely used as textile dyes; however, they are another group ofsynthetic chemicals that are not permanently bound to fabrics; they are alsotoxic, as the Greenpeace report states,> “Certain azo dyes can break down under reductive conditions to release> aromatic amines.”Aromatic amines are toxic and some have been proven to be carcinogenic.The November 2012 Greenpeace report is entitled Toxic Threads: Putting Pollutionon Parade; its purpose is to expose the pollution produced by the textileindustry in China. The report refers to the fact that some clothingmanufacturers, including many brand names, source their textile manufacturingfrom China and states that,> “The textile industry is built upon the use of a large number of chemicals,> and China is now the largest consumer of textile chemicals, with 42% of global> consumption.”The report focuses on pollution caused by the discharge of toxic chemical wastesinto the environment; but this is not the sole issue of concern. The major issuefrom a human health perspective is that the manufacture of clothes utilisesprocesses that involve many different toxic chemicals that can seep out of theclothing fabric. These chemicals can be absorbed into the skin, which enablesthem to pass into systemic circulation and therefore poison the bloodstream.The emphasis by the report on the situation in China creates the impression thatit is Chinese industry that is the source of the problem due to their badmanufacturing practices; but this impression is misleading. The textile industryin China does utilise toxic chemicals in the manufacture of textiles andclothing and therefore does pollute the environment; however, the pollution itproduces is the direct result of the use of toxic chemicals; a practice that isnot exclusive to China. Most, if not all manufacturing processes that utilisetoxic chemicals will inevitably discharge toxic wastes, pollute the environmentand generate human health hazards; the clothing industry is no exception.The clothing manufacturers that source their textiles from China have generallymade that decision for commercial reasons, which include lower costs and lessrestrictive or even absent regulatory oversight; the relocation of industries tocountries in Asia and other parts of the world is discussed further in chaptereight.Formaldehyde is another chemical of concern that is utilised by the textileindustry; some of its uses include finishes that are claimed to impartproperties such as anti-cling, anti-static, waterproof, perspiration-proof andmoth-proof, amongst others. Although known to be highly toxic, formaldehyde isclaimed to be useful, because, as explained in Killer Clothes,> “...it’s a simple molecule that can connect individual fibers and enable them> to hold their shape after repeated cleanings.”It is claimed that formaldehyde helps to prevent colours from ‘running’; whichis the reason for its use in dyes and printing inks. The focus of the Greenpeacereport on pollution levels in China overlooks the fact that formaldehyde iscommonly used in clothing, wherever it is manufactured; an issue that isrecognised in Killer Clothes,> “When it comes to the presence of formaldehyde in clothing, no country in the> world bans its use in textiles...”It has been discovered that formaldehyde is another chemical that does notremain tightly bound. The ubiquitous nature of formaldehyde together with itsability to leak from fabrics, inks and dyes provide many sources of exposure tothis carcinogenic chemical that can be absorbed, especially by inhalation, intothe body. Some of the symptoms known to result from the inhalation offormaldehyde include severe coughing, bronchitis, asthma, chest pain, wheezing,and inflammation of the windpipe, bronchi and even lungs. These adverse effectscan occur due to exposure to concentrations of formaldehyde that are lower thanthose deemed to be ‘safe’.Another treatment to which some textiles are subjected involves the use of‘antibacterial’ substances on the basis of the claim that bacteria are the causeof ‘unpleasant body odours’; this is yet another unfounded claim. The substancesutilised for this purpose in clothing are mainly triclosan, triclocarban andsilver, the first two of which have been discussed. Although a natural metal,silver is claimed to be toxic to bacterial cells; however, according to a 1994article entitled Antibacterial Silver,> “…its toxicity to human cells is considerably lower than to bacteria.”A ‘considerably lower’ level of toxicity is not synonymous with ‘non-toxic’ nordoes it mean that silver is ‘safe’ for humans; it should be noted that silver isnot considered to be an essential component of the human body. In addition toits use as an antibacterial, silver is also claimed to ‘kill’ viruses; anentirely unfounded claim as the particles called ‘viruses’ are not livingentities.Although nanotechnology is still in its infancy, the silver incorporated intoclothing for ‘antibacterial’ purposes is increasingly in the form ofnanoparticles. The EU website contains a number of pages that discussnanotechnologies and nanoparticles, one of which, entitled What are potentialharmful effects of nanoparticles, states that,> “Nanoparticles can have the same dimensions as biological molecules such as> proteins.”The page also refers to inflammation that can be induced by nanoparticles andclaims that,> “Nanoparticles may cross cell membranes.”As demonstrated throughout this book, the medical establishment does not possessa comprehensive knowledge of the functions of the human body, especially at thecellular level. Dr Harold Hillman has extensively documented that mostprocedures and preparation materials used in the investigation of cellssignificantly alter their nature. He also states that these procedures generatecell ‘artefacts’, even though the medical establishment regards them as naturalcomponents of cells.The medical establishment’s poor level of understanding about the human body inthe state of health or disease means that the full extent of the potentialconsequences from the use of silver nanoparticles is entirely unknown. Theseknowledge gaps with respect to nanoparticles are recognised, albeit to a limitedextent, by the EU web page which acknowledges that,> “There remain many unknown details about the interaction of nanoparticles and> biological systems…”Another ‘finish’, which is mainly applied to outer layers of clothing, is oneintended to provide ‘protection’ from insects, for which the toxic chemical mostfrequently used is permethrin. The use of insecticides in clothing originatesfrom the military and is based on the idea that insecticide-treated clothingwill protect people who wear them from insect-borne diseases, especiallymalaria. The use of insecticides has however been expanded to include civilianclothing, as reported in Killer Clothes,> “The practice of intentionally adding toxins to fabrics as an insect repellent> is now commonplace throughout both the military and civilian clothing> industries worldwide.”The development of permethrin was based on the discovery that chrysanthemumscontain compounds called pyrethrins, which appear to act as natural insectrepellents. Permethrin is, however, a synthetic derivative of pyrethrin and,although considered to be of low toxicity, the Beyond Pesticides fact sheetentitled Permethrin states that,> “Permethrin can be irritating to both the eyes and the skin.”Although clothes treated with permethrin are not generally worn next to theskin, that does not mean there will be no exposure to this irritant.There are many different chemicals used in the manufacture of clothes and,although some are claimed to be tightly bound to fabrics or printed images, thishas been shown not to be the case. The ‘leaking’ of any chemicals out ofclothing will result in dermal exposure and can also result in dermal absorptionof substances into the skin or even into the bloodstream and the whole bodilysystem.In addition to the chemicals used in the manufacture of clothes are those usedas ingredients of clothes-cleaning products; especially laundry detergents andfabric softeners, as discussed. Residues of some laundry products are intendedto remain in the clothes; this particularly applies to their ‘fragrance’chemicals, as also discussed.However, although the combination of chemicals in domestic laundry cleaningproducts may cause concern, dry cleaning is not a safer option as it alsoinvolves the use of a variety of chemicals, many of which are equally, if notmore, toxic. One of the most significant groups of chemicals used are solvents,some of which are known to ‘off-gas’ from the fabric and pose hazards to therespiratory system. The most common chemical used as a dry-cleaning solvent isperchloroethylene, also referred to as ‘perc’, which is described by JoeThornton in Pandora’s Poison,> “Perchloroethylene is a particular problem, because its use as a solvent in> thousands of small dry cleaning shops means that it pollutes the homes and> workplaces of millions of people at short range.”Perc is toxic; it is known to severely affect the respiratory system and cause awide range of adverse health effects. This volatile chemical poses a clearhealth hazard, not only to people who wear dry-cleaned clothes but also to thepeople who operate the dry-cleaning machinery and are therefore exposed to thistoxic solvent on a daily basis.It is evident that clothes can contain a rich variety of toxic chemicals; it isalso evident that there is little public awareness of this problem; the reasonfor the existence of this situation is suggested in Killer Clothes,> “Clothing manufacturers and even many toxicologists choose to believe that> absorbing tiny amounts of toxic chemicals from individual items of clothing> cannot be harmful to you.”This is yet another application of the Paracelsus fallacy that is of benefit toclothing manufacturers but has detrimental consequences for the people who wearthe clothes.As discussed, some chemicals interact synergistically, which can raise theirindividual toxicities by orders of magnitude, but these synergies are rarelyrecognised and even more rarely are they tested; as indicated in Killer Clothes,> “Those synergistic processes constitute the ‘black hole’ of ignorance within> the fields of toxicology and preventive medicine.”There is indeed an immense ‘black hole of ignorance’ with respect to the fullpotential for harm caused by exposures to the thousands of toxic chemicals usedin the manufacture of clothes that are intended to be worn next to or close tothe skin.Another detrimental feature of synthetic fibres is one that is not directlyrelated to the use of toxic chemicals; this is the fact that, unlike theirnatural counterparts, most synthetic fibres do not allow the skin to ‘breathe’,as discussed in Killer Clothes,> “Human-made petrochemical fibers restrict and suffocate the skin, our largest> and most sensitive body organ, making it unable to breathe properly...”It may be suggested that the solution to this problem would be to source clothesmade from ‘natural’ fibres, such as cotton, wool, flax, hemp and silk. However,even natural fibres may be ‘poisoned’ in a number of ways, one of which mayresult from ‘treatments’ applied to their source. For example, as previouslydiscussed, sheep are dipped in order to ‘treat’ their fleeces with toxicinsecticides, residues of which may remain throughout the manufacturingprocesses that produce woollen garments. Similar problems occur with cotton, oneof the main issues with which is that it is increasingly grown as a GM crop thatis ‘treated’ with large volumes of pesticides, residues of which can remainwithin cotton fabric used in the manufacture of clothes.The solution to this problem first requires knowledge of its existence. Although‘toxic clothes’ may not be easily or entirely avoidable, knowledge of the extentof the problem enables people to make informed decisions and choices in order toat least reduce, if not entirely eliminate their exposures to the ‘poisons’ intheir clothes. Solutions to this problem are discussed in chapter ten.DentistryThe establishment definition of dentistry refers to,> “the study, management, and treatment of diseases and conditions affecting the> mouth, jaws, teeth and their supporting tissues.”Despite the claim that dentistry involves the study and treatment of diseasesspecific to the area surrounding the mouth, it is not classified as a branch of‘medicine’; nevertheless, dentistry utilises some of the same flawed theoriesand practices as the medical establishment, especially the ‘germ theory’ and theuse of toxic substances as ‘treatments’, on the basis that they are ‘safe’ ifused at the right dose.In their book entitled Uninformed Consent, dentist Hal Huggins DDS MS andphysician Dr Thomas Levy MD explain that dentists are largely oblivious to thetoxic nature of the substances that they use, often on a daily basis,> “Most dentists are entirely unaware of either the contents of the dental> materials they implant or the potential consequences of those materials after> they get into your body.”Dentists are obviously aware of some of the hazards involved in their work,particularly the dangers from exposure to X-rays. However, like their colleaguesin the medical establishment, dentists ought to be fully aware of the toxicnature of all of the substances they use, especially mercury and fluoride, bothof which have been acknowledged by the WHO to be toxic. Although mercury andfluoride have been discussed elsewhere in this chapter, they require furtherexamination in respect of their use in dentistry; they are not, however, theonly toxic substances used by dentists.The main application for which mercury is used in dentistry is dental amalgam,as explained in Uninformed Consent,> “Called ‘silver fillings’ due to their initial shiny appearance, amalgam is> made from powders of copper, tin, silver and zinc mixed with approximately 50%> liquid elemental mercury.”Despite the increasing acknowledgement of mercury’s toxicity, the medicalestablishment continues to claim that it is ‘safe’ for use in the mouth; this isdemonstrated by the EPA web page entitled Mercury in Dental Amalgam that states,> “Amalgam is one of the most commonly used tooth fillings, and is considered to> be a safe, sound and effective treatment for tooth decay.”The EPA page contains a link to an FDA web page entitled About Dental Amalgams,which, under the heading ‘Potential Risks’, explains some of the risksassociated with amalgam, about which it states,> “It releases low levels of mercury in the form of a vapour that can be inhaled> and absorbed by the lungs. High levels of mercury vapour exposure are> associated with adverse effects in the brain and the kidneys.”This statement would seem to contradict the EPA’s claim that amalgams are‘safe’; however, the position of the FDA seems to be self-contradictory as thesame web page contains the statement that,> “The weight of credible scientific evidence reviewed by FDA does not establish> an association between dental amalgam use and adverse health effects in the> general population.”These contradictory statements made by the FDA and EPA are seemingly ‘resolved’by the idea that it is only high levels of exposure to mercury that areproblematic and by the claim that amalgams do not represent high exposurelevels. There is, however, a significant volume of credible scientific evidencethat establishes a clear association between adverse health problems andexposures to very low levels of mercury. One surprising source of this evidenceis the WHO in a 2005 policy paper entitled Mercury in Health Care that states,> “Recent studies suggest that mercury may have no threshold below which some> adverse effects do not occur.”Other sources state unequivocally that there is no safe level of exposure tomercury.Corroboration of the assertion that mercury is an extremely hazardous materialis demonstrated by the fact that dental amalgam is treated in dental surgeriesas ‘hazardous waste’ that requires special procedures to be followed to ensureits safe removal and safe disposal. It is therefore disingenuous for dentists toclaim ignorance about the hazards associated with either mercury or amalgam.Nevertheless, amalgam fillings continue to be used on the basis of the claimthat amalgam is a stable compound within which mercury is ‘inert’ and therefore‘harmless’. But this claim is refuted by the EPA statement referred to above,which states that one of the ‘risks’ associated with amalgams is the release ofmercury vapour that can be absorbed into the lungs. This point is furthersubstantiated in Uninformed Consent, in which it is stated that released mercuryvapour can be detected,> “After implantation in your teeth, and for an indefinite period of time,> silver mercury fillings outgas readily detectable amounts of mercury vapor.”The EPA statement also referred to the ability of mercury vapour to causeadverse effects in the brain and kidneys. The effects in the brain should not besurprising on the basis of mercury’s known neurotoxicity. The kidneys are organsof detoxification, therefore effects in these organs are indicative of systemicpoisoning. Furthermore, the ‘normal’ levels of mercury released from amalgamfillings are increased in the presence of dental work that utilises othermetals, for example gold or nickel crowns.In Uninformed Consent, Hal Huggins relates an incident that demonstrates theeffects of dental amalgams on health. A young patient of his, who had previouslyhad amalgam fillings placed in her teeth, had been diagnosed with leukaemia. Hertreatment consisted of the removal of her amalgam fillings, after which herhealth improved. Her physician declared that her leukaemia was ‘in remission’but refused to consider that the removal of her fillings had been relevant toher recovery. At her next visit to Hal Huggins, he replaced the amalgam fillingsin her teeth, after which her leukaemia returned. In her next visit, he removedthe fillings and she again recovered her health.As will be discussed in chapter seven, cancer is rarely, if ever, caused by asingle factor, but this example, even though ‘anecdotal’, is a cleardemonstration that amalgam fillings can have a significant adverse impact onhealth, and that their removal can result in a significant improvement tohealth.It must be emphasised that amalgam fillings should only be removed by dentistswho are aware of and follow the correct procedures; there are potentiallyserious adverse effects that can result if these procedures are not followed.In Death by Modern Medicine, Dr Carolyn Dean provides an interesting summary ofthe origin of the use of mercury in dentistry in America,> “Around the 1830s, dentistry was an unregulated service. Free market medical> men, barbers, and blacksmiths elbowed each other for patients. They found that> mercury amalgams fitted much more easily than hot lead, and were much cheaper> than gold. Since mercury fillings, technically, were outside the body, most> lay dentists were not concerned about potential toxicity. Medical‐dentists who> were concerned tried to warn the public but the initial rush for cheap> fillings drowned them out. The lay dentists and the pro‐amalgam dentists> became so powerful they eventually formed their own dental association in> 1859, the American Dental Association (ADA). The ADA continued to promote and> support the use of mercury amalgams as a safe dental product.”The choice of lead for fillings is yet another example of the inappropriate useof highly toxic materials. However, despite Dr Dean’s reference to‘medical-dentists’ who, even in the 19th century, were aware of its toxicity,mercury continued to be used in some ‘medicines’ in the 20th century and isstill used in the 21st century in certain antiseptic substances, as well ascertain vaccines and amalgam fillings.The March 2017 WHO fact sheet entitled Mercury and health claims that anoutright ban of amalgam fillings would be ‘problematic’ for the dental sector;this is disingenuous because these fillings are extremely detrimental to humanhealth, which ought to be the priority of the WHO. Nevertheless, the WHOrecommends that the use of amalgam dental fillings should be ‘phased out’ andthat cost-effective alternatives should be developed.Another hazardous material used in dentistry is nickel, which is a component ofcrowns, bridges, braces and partial dentures; its dangers are explained inUninformed Consent,> “Nickel is one of the most durable yet most carcinogenic metals on this> planet.”The authors explain that many dentists are under the impression that stainlesssteel, which is also used in dental products, is ‘safe’; they also explain thatthis is a mistaken impression because stainless steel contains nickel. Some ofthe alloys used for dental products, such as crowns and bridges for example, arecompounds that, in addition to nickel, can contain substances such as beryllium,cobalt and chromium, all of which are toxic. As has been discussed, some metalsinteract synergistically; for example, cobalt can enhance the carcinogenicity ofnickel; the mixture of cobalt and nickel in an alloy used for dental productscan only be described as entirely inappropriate.Metals are not the only toxic ingredients used in the manufacture of dentalproducts; dentures for example, may be made from acrylic, which is another toxicmaterial that has been associated with adverse health effects, as reported inChemical Exposures,> “Acrylic dentures may provoke headache, joint pain, fatigue and rashes.”As previously discussed, the body is not solely biochemical in nature, it isalso bioelectrical; therefore, dental products and fillings made from certainmetals are able to interfere with and disrupt the body’s bioelectricalfunctions; as discussed by the authors of Uninformed Consent,> “Fillings are like little tiny batteries. They have an electrical charge.”Adverse effects can also result from the electrical charges produced byfillings; these effects can include an increased release of mercury fromamalgams, especially in the presence of other metals; the authors explain that,> “This is due to the electric current generated by the presence of dissimilar> metals being present in an electrolyte such as saliva.”The electric current generated in the mouth can alter ‘normal’ bioelectricalactivity and, in the same way that chemicals can poison the brain, this‘abnormal’ electrical activity can adversely affect the brain and effectively‘poison’ it, as they state,> “Fillings are pushing very high electrical charges into the brain relative to> what the brain normally operates on...”Fluoride is yet another highly toxic substance used in dentistry. It is widelypromoted as beneficial for ‘dental health’ when applied directly onto the teeth,which is the justification for the addition of fluoride to products such astoothpastes and mouthwashes. This is demonstrated by the WHO September 2018 factsheet entitled Oral health which includes the following statement quoted as a‘fact’,> “Dental caries can be largely prevented by maintaining a constant low level of> fluoride in the oral cavity.”This claim is based on the idea that fluoride protects and strengthens weakteeth by replacing lost minerals; but as the previous discussion about waterfluoridation demonstrated, fluoride weakens teeth by causing a condition calleddental fluorosis. Nevertheless, the medical establishment continues to promotethe use of fluoridated toothpastes, as indicated by the UK NHS web page entitledFluoride that states,> “Brushing your teeth thoroughly with fluoride toothpaste is one of the most> effective ways of preventing tooth decay.”This web page also recommends that mouthwashes should not be used after brushingthe teeth with fluoridated toothpastes as this will wash the fluoride away.These statements clearly raise questions about the rationale behind the allegedbenefits of water fluoridation, because water that is ingested does not remainin the mouth to ‘coat’ the teeth.As previously discussed, the overwhelming weight of evidence demonstrates thatnot only does fluoride confer no benefits for dental health, it is highly toxicand extremely dangerous; as indicated by Christopher Bryson in The FluorideDeception,> “Fluoride is so potent a chemical that it’s also a grave environmental hazard> and a potential workplace poison.”This potent poison cannot strengthen teeth by replacing lost minerals; it canonly cause damage to the teeth and to the whole body when ingested.The cause of weakened or decayed teeth is claimed to be bacterial acids thatattack teeth when sugary foods and drinks are consumed; this is yet anotherfallacy generated by the rigid adherence to the ‘germ theory’. There is however,no need to invoke the existence of ‘germs’ to explain tooth decay, one of thecauses of which is explained by Dr George Waldbott in Fluoridation: The GreatDilemma,> “It is now well established that consumption of sugar and other refined> carbohydrates associated with civilisation has been primarily responsible for> the recent dramatic increase in caries.”One of the major causes of tooth decay is clearly the consumption of refinedsugars in various forms, including processed food products that contain highlevels of sugars, and particularly confectionery that is frequently given tosmall children as ‘treats’; but these so-called treats are detrimental to healthin a number of ways.The problem of tooth decay caused by a high consumption of refined sugarproducts clearly cannot be solved by the application of toxic fluoride‘treatments’. Problems can only be solved by the removal of their cause; theproblem of tooth decay therefore can only be ‘solved’ by the elimination fromthe diet of all forms of refined sugars. As previously discussed, many otherhealth benefits can be achieved by the elimination of this ‘sweet poison’ fromthe diet.It is clear that many dental products, processes and ‘treatments’ involve theuse of some highly toxic materials that are significant contributors to the‘poisoning’ of the body.In SummaryThe discussions in this chapter have explored the myriad ways in which peopleare ‘poisoned’ on a daily basis. However, as stated at the outset, the purposeof this chapter has been to inform, not depress; for it is only by possessingall of the required information that people are able to make informed decisions.It is clear from the discussions in this chapter that toxic substances areubiquitous; they are used in a wide variety of applications that impactvirtually every aspect of life in the 21st century.The medical establishment recognises that some substances are toxic, butdownplays their significance in the causation of ‘disease’ in order to maintainthe false narrative that ‘germs’ pose far greater hazards to human health. Asdiscussed at the beginning of this chapter, the WHO recognises that the healthof the environment affects the health of the people who inhabit thatenvironment; but this too is downplayed in favour of another false narrative,which claims that atmospheric carbon dioxide is the cause of climate change andthat this is the most important environmental issue of the 21st century.The close relationship between the health of the environment and the health ofthe human inhabitants of the environment means that it is extremely important topay attention to activities that pollute the environment. The most importantenvironmental problem is due to pollution, contamination and degradation, whichare almost entirely due to the sum total of all industrial activities, butmainly to those that involve: the extraction of resources; the development, useand disposal of toxic chemicals; the development of nuclear weapons and power;and the development of technologies that utilise unnatural electromagneticradiation.These activities are mostly, although not entirely, conducted without dueconsideration for their consequences, their impact on the environment or theirimpact on human health. Furthermore, despite assurances that industrialactivities and their products are all ‘safe’, this chapter has demonstratedotherwise.The essence of this problem is articulated by Dr Paul Craig Roberts in his March2015 article entitled The Oceans Are Dying in which he states that,> “While the powerful capitalists use the environment for themselves as a> cost-free dumping ground, the accumulating costs threaten everyone’s life.”The claim that ‘industry’ is largely responsible for environmental problems andhuman illness is often regarded as ‘Luddite’ and usually criticised asrepresenting a view that is ‘anti-progress’, ‘anti-science’ and‘anti-development’. This point is encapsulated by medical writer Martin JWalker, whose words are quoted by Dr Samuel Epstein in The Politics of Cancer,> “The dissident who questions the chemical companies, the industrial food> companies, and inevitably the state, is branded as irrational, anti-science> and anti-technology and hence as a subversive standing in the way of> progress.”This type of criticism falls within the logical fallacy referred to as the ‘adhominem attack’, the sole purpose of which is to vilify the person rather thandiscuss their work; this form of attack always fails to address the issuesraised.Each section within this chapter has provided at least some of the availableevidence that refutes the establishment claims about each of the topics underdiscussion; furthermore, the discussions have demonstrated the contribution ofeach industrial activity to human illness and environmental degradation.Many scientists claim to be able to understand the laws of nature; but this issheer hubris; as this book demonstrates, there are vast gaps in ‘scientificknowledge’. Dr George Waldbott MD recognised the disingenuous nature of suchclaims in Fluoridation: The Great Dilemma,> “We assume that the laws of nature are universal and constant. Man, however,> does not always understand nature’s laws; his interpretations are imperfect,> and today’s wisdom is often merely tomorrow’s folly.”The discussions in the next chapter provide yet more examples of the ‘knowledgegaps’ that exist within ‘modern medicine’ as well as the poor level ofunderstanding of the medical establishment about the major ‘diseases’ that aresaid to afflict millions of people around the world.It has been shown that manufacturers are held responsible for the safety oftheir products; it has also been shown that the basis of their claims about‘safety’ rely on the idea that a ‘safe dose’ of each individual substance can bedetermined by reference to testing procedures conducted within a laboratory. Thelaboratory setting is, however, completely divorced from the real-worldenvironment, in which the everyday experiences of most people involve exposuresto a wide variety of multiple toxic substances in combinations that have neverbeen tested for their safety, nor have they been evaluated for their effects onhuman health.Under the existing ‘system’, adverse health effects are generally discovered asthe result of epidemiological studies, which, although conducted in the realworld, are unable to determine a single specific effect that results from asingle activity or exposure to a single substance. For example, after many yearsof epidemiological studies, smoking was finally linked to lung cancer, however,this illness is clearly not inevitable as some smokers never contract lungcancer; which means that other factors must be involved. Ill-health is alwaysthe result of multiple influences. This means that there is rarely a singlecausal factor for any of the conditions of ill-health that are incorrectlyreferred to as ‘diseases’; these points are discussed in detail in chapter ten.It is abundantly clear that the human body is amazingly resilient, asdemonstrated by the ability to withstand exposures to many different toxins.However, as stated at the beginning of this chapter, there is a limit to theability of the human body to function properly under a constant barrage of toxicsubstances and unnatural electromagnetic radiation.It is possible to reduce exposures to these hazards and even to eliminate someof them entirely; but it requires knowledge of their existence and theapplications in which they are used, which is the main purpose of this chapter.The final comment in this chapter is reserved for Rachel Carson, who wrote oneof the major exposés of the 20th century in which she alerted the world to thedangers posed by the vast array of toxic chemicals applied for a wide variety ofpurposes. In Silent Spring, she also provided a lasting message that is asrelevant in the early 21st century as it was in the mid-20th century,> “The choice, after all, is ours to make. If, having endured much, we have at> last asserted our ‘right to know’, and if, knowing, we have concluded that we> are being asked to take senseless and frightening risks, then we should no> longer accept the counsel of those who tell us that we must fill our world> with poisonous chemicals...”"},{"pageContent":"> 7. ‘Non-Infectious’ Diseases: More Medical Misconceptions> “Each of these recurrent exposures, no matter how slight, contributes to the> progressive build-up of chemicals in our bodies and so to cumulative> poisoning.” Rachel Carson The WHO is the authoritative body of the medical establishment responsible forproviding information about matters pertaining to health. This includes theidentification of diseases, which is provided by the ICD (InternationalClassification of Diseases); this is described by the ICD information sheet onthe WHO website as,> “…the global health information standard for mortality and morbidity> statistics.”The information sheet also states that,> “The ICD defines the universe of diseases, disorders, injuries and other> related health conditions.”The ICD lists all ‘known’ diseases and conditions, each of which is sub-dividedaccording to certain criteria and each individual element within each categoryof disease is allocated a unique ICD code. However, the purpose of the ICD isnot solely to enable the monitoring of health trends and the compilation ofstatistics; it is also described as,> “…the diagnostic classification standard for all clinical and research> purposes.”It is clear therefore, that the ICD is intended to be the definitive guide to‘disease’ for the entire medical establishment.The ICD lists many thousands of different ‘diseases’, but they are allcategorised as either ‘infectious’ or ‘non-infectious’. Previous discussionshave, however, exposed the fatally flawed nature of the theories pertaining to‘infectious diseases’; they have also demonstrated that the explanations offeredby the medical establishment about these diseases contain many anomalies,inconsistencies and contradictions and present a number of aspects that remainpoorly understood.The flawed nature of the medical establishment’s theories and explanations about‘infectious diseases’ inevitably raises questions about the veracity of theirtheories and explanations about ‘non-infectious diseases’, which are usuallyreferred to as ‘noncommunicable diseases’ or NCDs.A number of the most significant NCDs are discussed in this chapter, in which itwill be shown that the information promulgated by the medical establishmentabout them contain many anomalies, inconsistencies and contradictions. Thediscussions will also demonstrate that, for the vast majority, if not all, ofthese diseases, the medical establishment has a poor level of understandingabout their nature, as well as their causes and the mechanisms of actioninvolved.It is claimed that NCDs are responsible for the majority of all deathsworldwide; the June 2018 WHO fact sheet entitled Noncommunicable diseases statesthat,> “Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) kill 41 million people each year, equivalent> to 71% of all deaths globally.”According to the fact sheet, CVDs (cardiovascular diseases) are the most seriousgroup of diseases and cause 17.9 million deaths each year. Cancer is the secondmost serious group and accounts for 9.0 million deaths; respiratory diseases,the third group, is said to account for 3.9 million deaths; diabetes, the fourthmost serious, is said to account for 1.6 million deaths. The fact sheet addsthat,> “These 4 groups of diseases account for over 80% of all premature NCD deaths.”The term ‘premature’ refers to deaths that occur in people younger than 70.The 2013 WHO report entitled Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Controlof Noncommunicable Diseases 2013-2020, which will be referred to as the GlobalAction Plan report, states that,> “NCDs are now well-studied and understood...”The level of confidence expressed in this statement is, however, unfounded;whilst NCDs may be ‘well-studied’ they cannot be described as ‘understood’, asthe discussions in this chapter will demonstrate.Unlike ‘infectious diseases’, there is no core ‘theory’ on which NCDs are based;however, the fact sheet describes some of the features these diseases areclaimed to share,> “Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), also known as chronic diseases, tend to be> of long duration and are the result of a combination of genetic,> physiological, environmental and behavioural factors.”Although ‘genetic factors’ are claimed to contribute to the onset of many NCDs,this is another medical misconception, as a number of the discussions in thischapter will demonstrate.The role of ‘environmental factors’ in NCDs is only referred to by a generalcomment in the fact sheet that,> “These diseases are driven by forces that include rapid unplanned> urbanization, globalization of unhealthy lifestyles and population ageing.”The previously cited Healthy Environments report does acknowledge that‘environmental factors’ contribute to ill-health, although that recognition doesnot extend to all of the food, water and environmental pollutants discussed inchapter six.The references in the fact sheet to ‘behavioural factors’ and ‘unhealthylifestyles’ are linked in the claim that there are four ‘risk factors’ withwhich all NCDs are associated,> “Tobacco use, physical inactivity, the harmful use of alcohol and unhealthy> diets all increase the risk of dying from a NCD.”This statement is not entirely incorrect, because smoking has been proven to beharmful to health; nevertheless, it is misleading with respect to risks posed by‘physical inactivity’, about which the fact sheet states,> “1.6 million deaths annually can be attributed to insufficient physical> activity.”This is misleading; insufficient physical activity alone does not cause death.Whilst one school of thought suggests that a moderate level of alcoholconsumption is harmless and another suggests it may be beneficial, it should benoted that alcohol can harm the body, especially the liver and brain.Furthermore, alcoholic beverages may contain additives that, although permitted,are toxic; as discussed in chapter six, sulphur dioxide is used as apreservative in some wines and beers.An unhealthy diet is certainly one of the main factors that contribute toill-health, as will be discussed in chapter ten; but the fact sheet only makes aspecific reference to one aspect of an unhealthy diet, namely, an excess intakeof salt/sodium. The discussions in the previous chapter about ‘poisoned food’indicate that an appropriate explanation of an ‘unhealthy diet’ ought to includereference to the wide range of processed ‘food products’ that contain toxicchemical additives, and therefore fail to fulfil the fundamental purpose of foodto provide nutrients. The reason for this omission may relate to the involvementof the WHO with the CAC, which regards food additives created from syntheticchemicals as ‘safe’ when used at the appropriate ‘level’.In addition to the four behavioural risk factors, the fact sheet refers to four‘metabolic’ risk factors, which are stated to be raised blood pressure,overweight/obesity, hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia. These factors are saidto increase the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, which are discussedin the next section.It is claimed that overweight and obesity are the result of an intake ofcalories in excess of those expended, and that physical activity shouldtherefore be increased to reduce these excess calories and solve the problem;but this is yet another medical misconception. One of the main factors thatcontributes to obesity is a diet that consists almost entirely of processed‘food products’ that are high in non-nutrients but contain few, if any,essential nutrients; a situation that cannot be solved through an increasedlevel of physical activity. Problems can only be resolved when their root causeshave been identified and addressed.By definition, NCDs are not ‘communicable’; which means that they are nottransmissible between people; nevertheless, the Global Action Plan report claimsthat,> “The role of infectious agents in the pathogenesis of noncommunicable> diseases, either on their own or in combination with genetic and environmental> influences, has been increasingly recognized in recent years.”The claim that ‘infectious agents’ play a role in the pathogenesis of NCDsindicates that the medical establishment has completely redefined the term‘noncommunicable’; this claim is, however, unfounded, ‘germs’ play no role inthe development of any disease.Two ‘noncommunicable diseases’ in which the WHO claims ‘infectious agents’ playa direct causal role, are cervical cancer and hepatitis, both of which are saidto be caused by ‘viruses’. The discussion about cervical cancer in chapter twodemonstrated that this condition is not caused by a virus. The discussions inchapter three demonstrated that ‘viruses’ cannot be the cause of ‘hepatitis’,which is a health problem that involves damage to the liver, the body’s maindetoxification organ. Hepatitis is discussed further in chapter eight; however,it should be noted that this condition is indicative of toxins that haveadversely affected the liver; as demonstrated by the recognised associationbetween alcoholism and ‘liver disease’.Another factor that is claimed to be associated with NCDs is poverty; the factsheet states,> “NCDs disproportionately affect people in low- and middle-income countries> where more than three quarters of global NCD deaths – 32 million – occur.”This is misleading because the majority of the world population lives in low- ormiddle-income countries. It is also erroneous because NCDs are claimed to be‘diseases of affluence’, which means they should be mainly, if not solely,experienced by people in high income countries. According to a November 2018article entitled The macroeconomic burden of noncommunicable diseases in theUnited States: Estimates and projections states that,> “In the United States, NCDs account for 89% of all deaths…”This is clearly a far higher burden than the global average of 71 per centquoted in the WHO NCD fact sheet; it is also higher the ‘more than threequarters’ experienced in low- and middle-income countries; yet the US is claimedto be a high-income country. As the discussion about iatrogenesis in chapter onerevealed, the US has the most expensive healthcare system, yet Americans aresome of the least healthy people by comparison to the populations of other‘high-income’ countries; the article states that,> “…the United States has extraordinarily high health expenditures, but does not> attain the best health outcomes.”The reasons for this apparent paradox are explained throughout this book. It isperfectly clear, however, that neither high income status nor high healthexpenditures equate to better health for people.The reason that NCDs are claimed to be linked to poverty is expressed in the NCDfact sheet to be that,> “Vulnerable and socially disadvantaged people get sicker and die sooner than> people of higher social positions…”The fact sheet also claims that poor people have ‘limited access to healthservices’. This problem is also discussed in the Global Action Plan report,which states, under the heading Universal Health Coverage, that,> “All people should have access, without discrimination, to rationally> determined sets of the needed promotive, preventive, curative and> rehabilitative basic health services and essential safe, affordable, effective> and quality medicines.”The health services referred to as ‘needed’ are clearly those that are providedby the medical establishment system, which has been shown to be based on flawedtheories of disease causation. Furthermore, as previous discussions have alsodemonstrated, pharmaceutical drug treatments are not ‘curative’ and vaccines arenot ‘preventive’; it has been shown that, contrary to the claims made by themedical establishment, these ‘interventions’ cause harm and exacerbateill-health.The increased efforts to ‘harmonise’ all aspects of life under a ‘global’ systemare represented by a number of UN programmes. One of the most significant recentprogrammes of this type is the 2030 Agenda that contains 17 Goals, each of whichcontains a number of different ‘targets’ and all of which are to be achieved bythe year 2030. The core aim of SDG 3 is to,> “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.”A number of the 2030 Agenda goals are discussed in more detail in chapter eight;however, one of the targets of Goal 3 specifically refers to NCDs and states theaim to,> “By 2030, reduce by one third premature mortality from non-communicable> diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and> well-being.”The ability to create solutions to any problem first requires a fullunderstanding of the nature of the problem; the problems of ‘disease’ are noexception. However, as the discussions in this chapter will demonstrate, themedical establishment does not possess a full understanding of the nature ofnon-communicable diseases, and even admits to possessing a poor level ofunderstanding about the mechanisms involved in most, if not all of them. Thetopic of ‘mental health’ has been discussed in chapter one with reference topsychiatric medications, and will be further discussed in chapter ten.In common with other chapters, the ‘establishment definition’ of each diseasehas been taken from the 2007 edition of the Oxford Concise Medical Dictionary,unless otherwise indicated.Cardiovascular DiseasesCardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are those that affect the cardiovascular system,which is defined by the establishment as,> “the heart together with two networks of blood vessels…”The definition expands on this description and states that,> “The cardiovascular system effects the circulation of blood around the body,> which brings about transport of nutrients and oxygen to the tissues and the> removal of waste products.”The May 2017 WHO fact sheet entitled Cardiovascular diseases states that CVDsare the leading cause of death and were responsible for 31 per cent of worldwidemortality in 2015. The two CVDs of greatest significance are coronary heartdisease and cerebrovascular disease; coronary heart disease is described in thefact sheet as,> “disease of the blood vessels supplying the heart muscle.”Cerebrovascular disease is described as,> “disease of the blood vessels supplying the brain.”It is clear that any influence that impairs the cardiovascular system willaffect the circulation of the blood and the body’s two most vital organs; DrRussell Blaylock explains in Health and Nutrition Secrets that,> “Of all the organs, the brain and the heart are most vulnerable to impaired> circulatory function.”Heart attacks and strokes are the two most common CVD ‘events’, the risk factorsfor these events are claimed to be the same as those for all NCDs; namelytobacco use, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol. Thefact sheet adds that,> “The effects of behavioural risk factors may show up in individuals as raised> blood pressure, raised blood glucose, raised blood lipids, and overweight and> obesity.”The WHO recommends that these ‘risk factors’ are addressed, although furthermeasures may be required for people with underlying conditions,> “In addition, drug treatment of diabetes, hypertension and high blood lipids> may be necessary to reduce cardiovascular risk and prevent heart attacks and> strokes.”The WHO also recommends people with established disease to be treated with‘medicines’, the most common of which are aspirin, beta-blockers,angiotensin-converting inhibitors and statins.The fact sheet refers to the importance of addressing all NCDs; a concern thatresulted in the creation of the Global Action Plan report that contains nine‘targets’, two of which relate specifically to CVDs. One of these targets aimsto reduce the incidence of raised blood pressure by 25 per cent, on the basis ofthe claim that,> “Raised blood pressure is the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease.”Raised blood pressure is defined as a reading that exceeds the specific rangedeemed appropriate to the person’s age group. The discussion about hypertensionin chapter one discussed the results of the SPRINT study and the likelihood thatthe range of blood pressure readings regarded as ‘normal’ may be furtherreduced. The other target of the Global Action Plan report aims to ensure thatat least half of all ‘eligible people’ receive drug treatments in order toprevent heart attacks and strokes. It is clear that the intention is tosubstantially increase the number of people deemed ‘eligible’ for drugtreatments. However, although this will result in an immense boost to the salesand profits of the pharmaceutical industry, it will not achieve the intendedaims of addressing CVDs; pharmaceutical drugs can neither prevent nor alleviatedisease.The fact sheet claims that, in addition to the four ‘behavioural’ risk factors,there are other ‘determinants’ that affect CVDs; these are the same determinantsthat are said to apply to all NCDs; namely, globalization, urbanization andpopulation ageing. The WHO clearly recognises that multiple factors affecthealth and cause illness, but does not refer to the plethora of toxic substancesthat permeate and pollute food, water and the environment as the result ofindustrial activities. The fact sheet refers to another group of factors andstates that,> “Other determinants of CVDs include poverty, stress and hereditary factors.”Poverty is discussed in more detail in chapter eight; stress and ‘ageing’ arediscussed in more detail in chapter ten.The establishment view that hereditary factors can cause cardiovascular diseasesis illustrated by a February 2017 article entitled Sudden death warning overfaulty heart gene, which states that,> “Research has helped to discover many of the faulty genes that cause inherited> heart conditions.”This is another medical misconception; genes do not control the functions of thebody nor do they cause diseased conditions; on the contrary, genes arethemselves controlled by other factors that turn them on or off. These ‘otherfactors’ are discussed by Dr Robert Hedaya MD in his 4-part article seriesentitled Nutrition and Depression; it is the second article of the series thatis of particular interest for the purposes of this discussion. In this secondarticle, which is subtitled Nutrition, Methylation and Depression, Dr Hedayarefers to research findings within the field of epigenetics that havedemonstrated that genes,> “...are turned on or off by one’s environment, one’s diet, by stress or by> one’s experience...”Dr Hedaya is not alone in expressing the view that genes are not controllinginfluences, but are themselves controlled by other factors. Dr Bruce Lipton PhDhas also undertaken important research on the function of genes and theenvironmental influences that affect and control the fate of cells, as will alsobe discussed in chapter ten.Furthermore, as previously mentioned, the body is bioelectrical in nature aswell as biochemical; the two main organs that function electrically are thebrain and the heart, as demonstrated by the fact that their electrical activitycan be measured by EEG and ECG machines, respectively. Therefore, any influencethat disrupts the body’s bioelectrical system can disrupt the normal functioningof these two vital organs. The BioInitiative Report 2012 refers to evidence thatexposures to ELF-EMF (extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields) and RFR(radiofrequency radiation) have been linked to some cardiovascular effects.Although this finding should not be surprising, a more significant finding isthat the mechanism that connects EMF exposures to CVDs is oxidative stress.Within the BioInitiative Report is the statement that,> “…oxidative stress is gaining more and more ground as being the initial> mechanism of action of EMFs…”There is a large and growing body of scientific evidence that recognisesoxidative stress to be a key mechanism for many diseases, including CVDs; as thediscussions in this chapter will demonstrate.Oxidative stress is the result of an excess generation of free radicals, whichare atoms or molecules that have one or more unpaired electrons; these radicalsare unstable and highly reactive, which is the reason that they cause damage tothe body’s cells and tissues. There are different types of free radicals, mostof which are formed by reactions involving oxygen and are referred to as ROS(reactive oxygen species). They can, however, be formed by reactions involvingother elements, for example, those involving nitrogen are referred to as RNS(reactive nitrogen species). The web page entitled Free Radicals and ReactiveOxygen states that ‘radicals’ are formed during ‘normal biochemical reactions’,but that,> “…when generated in excess or not appropriately controlled, radicals can wreak> havoc on a broad range of macromolecules.”A 2004 article entitled Reactive oxygen species, vascular oxidative stress, andredox signaling in hypertension: what is the clinical significance? states thatunder ‘normal conditions’ there is a balance between oxidant formation andelimination; but that,> “…an imbalance between prooxidants and antioxidants results in oxidative> stress…”A 2008 article entitled Free Radicals, Antioxidants in Disease and Health statesthat some studies,> “…have provided precious evidence supporting the role of oxidative stress in a> number of CVDs…”A 2012 article entitled Drug-Induced Oxidative Stress and Toxicity states that,for some drugs,> “…there is evidence of elevation in cellular ROS in response to drug exposure,> and evidence implicates ROS and oxidative stress in toxicity…”The discussion about statins in chapter one referred to the medicalmisconception about cholesterol and the idea that LDL cholesterol is ‘bad’;whereas the real problem is the presence of oxidised cholesterol, both LDL andHDL; as Dr Blaylock explains,> “Free radicals in the blood oxidize the cholesterol-carrying lipoproteins> called LDL and HDL.”The highly reactive nature of these free radicals means that they can causedamage in the circulatory system; Dr Blaylock further explains,> “Once oxidised, they can damage blood vessel walls which leads to> atherosclerosis and all of its related complications including heart attacks,> strokes and peripheral vascular disease.”Another substance that has been demonstrated to contribute to cardiovasculardisease is refined sugar. One of the reasons that refined sugar is harmful isbecause it increases metabolism, which in turn increases oxidation and thegeneration of free radicals, as Dr Blaylock states,> “It is also well known that overfeeding, especially of high-energy foods like> sugars and carbohydrates dramatically increase metabolism and hence free> radical generation.”He explains that a high intake of sugar results in ‘glycation’, which is achemical reaction between sugar molecules and proteins, and that, whenglycolated, proteins are more easily oxidised. This provides an explanation forthe association between diabetes and cardiovascular problems, as indicated bythe suggestion in the fact sheet that the treatment of diabetes may preventheart attacks and strokes.It should be clear that pharmaceutical drugs can neither treat not prevent CVDs,or any of the health conditions that relate to the cardiovascular system. One ofthe most effective solutions to the problem of oxidative stress is an increasedintake of antioxidants. A 1996 article entitled Randomised controlled trial ofVitamin E in patients with coronary disease: Cambridge Heart Antioxidant Study(CHAOS) concluded that,> “…alpha-tocopherol treatment substantially reduces the rate of non-fatal MI…”MI is myocardial infarction, which is defined by the establishment as,> “death of a segment of heart muscle…”Oxidative stress clearly plays a contributory role in the onset of CVDs; equallyclear is that the resolution of cardiovascular problems will require the removalof influences that generate high levels of free radicals; one of thoseinfluences are pharmaceutical drugs that are known to be toxic, not curative.It is increasingly recognised that toxic substances exert their harmful effectsthrough the generation of free radicals that lead to oxidative stress and resultin free radical damage at the cellular level. It is for this reason thatattention needs to be paid to the foods consumed to ensure that the dietcontains a variety of food-based antioxidants; the importance of diet isdiscussed in more detail in chapter ten.Multiple Chemical SensitivityMultiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS) is a condition that affects a growing numberof people around the world.Although the condition was first identified in the mid-20th century, the 2007medical dictionary contains no reference to MCS or to any of the alternativenames by which it is known; these include: Chemical Injury, ChemicalSensitivity, Multiple Chemical Sensitivity Disorder, Environmental Illness andMultiple Allergy. These names are clear indicators of the factors thatcontribute to the condition, in other words, environmental toxins, especiallychemicals; this point is summarised by Nicholas Ashford and Dr Claudia Miller inChemical Exposures: Low Levels and High Stakes,> “Chemical exposures are endemic to our modern industrial society.”The reluctance of the medical establishment to acknowledge the significance oftoxic chemicals as causal factors for many conditions of illness, isdemonstrated by the paucity of available information about MCS, and by theabsence of a WHO fact sheet on the subject. The only information provided by theWHO is a passing reference to MCS in a 2005 Backgrounder article, entitledElectromagnetic fields and public health, that refers to EHS (electromagnetichypersensitivity), which is the topic of the next section in this chapter.Although the article does recognise similarities between EHS and MCS, it does soin a very disparaging manner,> “Both EHS and MCS are characterized by a range of non-specific symptoms that> lack apparent toxicological or physiological basis or independent> verification.”The article adds that,> “A more general term for sensitivity to environmental factors is Idiopathic> Environmental Intolerance...”The term ‘idiopathic’ means that the cause is unknown. The use of this term inthe context of MCS is disingenuous; the claim that the symptoms lack an‘apparent’ toxicological basis does not mean that toxic substances areirrelevant. As previously discussed, the vast majority of chemicals remainuntested for all possible adverse effects, and no tests have been conducted todiscover the effects from the various combinations of chemicals to which peopleare exposed on a daily basis.The condition referred to as ‘sensitivity to environmental factors’ gained somerecognition in the late 1980s, although it had first been mentioned in the1950s. The physician who brought attention to the problem was Dr Theron RandolphMD, who initiated the discipline called clinical ecology. In Chemical Exposures,the authors provide many details about Dr Randolph’s work, and report that hereferred to chemical sensitivity as the ‘petroleum problem’, as the result ofhis observations of a close correlation between the increased use ofpetroleum-based synthetic chemical compounds and an increased incidence ofcertain health problems. Correlation is obviously not evidence of causation; butthis correlation cannot be easily dismissed. The fact that petrochemicals havebeen proven to be harmful to health provides corroborative evidence that DrTheron had made a relevant and undeniable connection.The failure of the medical establishment to acknowledge the role of toxicchemicals, and other environmental pollutants, in the causation of many forms ofill-health creates a problem for sufferers of conditions like MCS; as explainedon the Multiple Chemical Sensitivity website,> “Many features of Multiple Chemical Sensitivity and its effects and the way> its effects are described by the sufferer seem altogether unrealistic,> impossible or implausible to a conventional and scientifically trained> consultant or G.P.”The people who suffer from MCS are poorly served by a medical system thatincreasingly adheres to an erroneous view, which has become the consensus andbeen encapsulated into a standardised system of disease recognition andclassification. Fortunately, there are some qualified physicians who haveexpanded their knowledge of health beyond their ‘conventional’ training, and whotherefore possess a better understanding of the role of environmental toxins, aswell as MCS and its causes. Dr Carolyn Dean, for example, who explains in Deathby Modern Medicine that,> “Our toxic environment causes a dramatic new condition in medicine called> Multiple Chemical Sensitivity Disorders (MCSD). MCSD patients can be so> sensitive to environmental chemicals that they are unable to read a newspaper> because they can’t tolerate the smell of ink; can’t use telephones because> they react to plastic; and can’t wear synthetic clothing that zaps them of> their energy.\"The wide variety of symptoms with which a person may suffer, together with therefusal of the medical establishment to recognise MCS as a genuine healthproblem, means that conventionally-trained physicians are likely to only focuson certain symptoms for which they will prescribe pharmaceutical drugs.Alternatively, some symptoms may indicate the existence of a ‘recognised’condition, such as an allergy. Although one of its alternative names is‘Multiple Allergy’, MCS is not regarded as a ‘true allergy’; allergies arediscussed later in this chapter.Interestingly, the Multiple Chemical Sensitivity website indicates that thereare many similarities between the symptoms of MCS and a number of otherconditions; it states,> “Also worthy of mention here is the fact that there is no sharp demarcation> between the symptoms of MCS and those of ME/CFS/CFIDS/PVFS.”ME is myalgic encephalomyelitis; CFS is chronic fatigue syndrome; CFIDS ischronic fatigue and immune dysfunction syndrome; PVFS is post-viral fatiguesyndrome. The absence of a sharp demarcation between the symptoms of theseconditions strongly indicates that they are not distinct and separatelyidentifiable disease entities, but should, more correctly, be viewed asdifferent combinations of symptoms with similar, although not necessarilyidentical causes.Nevertheless, there is a wide variety of symptoms that can be associated withthese conditions. The fact they may include anxiety, confusion, depression andirritability has resulted in a reference to MCS and similar conditions as‘psychogenic’; a term that suggests they are more psychological thanphysiological. This is an appalling attitude; many people genuinely suffer fromthis health problem; the fact that it is not ‘officially’ recognised does notmean that it does not exist. Unfortunately, however, these symptoms and theirmisunderstood causes can precipitate a referral to a psychiatrist, who may makea diagnosis of ‘mental illness’ and prescribe one or more of a variety ofpsychiatric ‘medications’. The discussion in chapter one showed that psychiatricdrugs are harmful; they clearly cannot correct neurological problems caused byexposures to neurotoxic chemicals.The multiplicity of symptoms presented by people with MCS is the direct resultof exposures to a multiplicity of toxic substances that affect different bodilyorgans and systems; a point that is substantiated by Dr Sarah Myhill MD, whostates, on the web page entitled Chemical poisoning – general principles ofdiagnosis and treatment, that,> “Every bodily system can be adversely affected by toxic chemicals, therefore> sufferers present with a multiplicity of symptoms.”Toxicology is the scientific study of poisons and their effects; however, likeconventional medicine, conventional toxicology suffers from fundamental flaws,not least of which is the idea that it is only the dose that makes a substance‘toxic’. This particular fallacy has been shown to generate profoundconsequences for health and especially for MCS, as the authors of ChemicalExposures explain,> “One reason MCS has been said to violate accepted principles of toxicology is> that it does not appear to follow a conventional dose-response relationship.”It is abundantly clear that significant limitations exist within ‘conventionaltoxicology’ as well as ‘conventional medicine’; particularly with respect to thefailure to acknowledge the toxicological causes of illness, and the role ofmultiple exposures to chemicals that interact in ways that can increase theirtoxicity, as the authors of Killer Clothes explain,> “The role of chemical synergies in triggering health problems isn’t understood> by most ordinary consumers, or by many toxicologists and physicians, for that> matter.”It is claimed that consumers are provided with information about the ingredientsof their products on the labels and that this information is sufficient forconsumer protection; but these are unacceptable claims, as explained by DrSamuel Epstein in Toxic Beauty,> “Labels present such an alphabet soup of complex chemical names that most of> us need a toxicological dictionary to read them.”Furthermore, as discussed, very few of the chemicals used in most consumerproducts have been tested for their safety or for the full range of theirpotential health effects. This fact is referred to in many scientific studies;for example, a 2007 article entitled Diverse Toxic Chemicals Disrupt CellFunction Through a Common Path states that,> “Sixty years after the dawn of the petrochemical era, health effects are known> for just a fraction of its bounty.”Although the adverse health effects of all petrochemicals remain unknown,because poorly tested, it is widely acknowledged that they are toxic; thisacknowledgement corroborates the existence of the connection betweenpetrochemicals and ‘environmental illnesses’ that was recognised by Dr Theron.It also refutes the medical establishment claim that MCS and other similarconditions are ‘idiopathic’.Although the entire range of chemical combinations to which people are exposedin the real world has not been evaluated, there exists a substantial volume ofevidence that demonstrates many of the adverse health effects that result fromexposures to multiple toxic chemicals. A July 2011 article entitled The Searchfor Reliable Biomarkers of Disease in Multiple Chemical Sensitivity and OtherEnvironmental Intolerances indicates the lack of understanding by the medicalestablishment about MCS, but nevertheless refers to the presence of oxidativestress in connection with this condition and states,> “Sustained organic damage occurring from chronic exposure to ambient doses of> environmental toxicant presumably involves specific malfunction of> detoxification pathways...”The references to organic damage and to poorly functioning detoxificationpathways indicate a serious level of systemic poisoning. The reference tooxidative stress is also extremely significant; as mentioned in the previoussection, free radical damage is a contributory factor for most, if not all,diseases. Dr Russell Blaylock explains in Health and Nutrition Secrets that,> “...free radicals appear to play a central role in virtually every disease you> can name, either directly or secondarily.”Furthermore, the previously cited 2007 article about Diverse Toxic Chemicalsrecognises that,> “…diverse toxicants can make cells more oxidised…”Cellular damage from high levels of free radicals is a clear mechanism for MCS.The previous chapter demonstrated that the operations of the chemical industryare extensive and that thousands of chemicals permeate virtually every aspect oflife. The consequences of these continual exposures to multiple toxic chemicalshave included the increased incidence of ‘sensitivities’ to chemicals that havepresented as conditions such as MCS, ME and CFS, to name just a few.Most of these conditions result from years of exposures to substances at levelsthat have been determined to be ‘safe’; but no long-term studies of chemicalshave ever been conducted to determine that decades of cumulative exposures tomultiple chemical combinations are ‘safe’. The adherence of the scientificcommunity to the Paracelsus fallacy has caused untold health damage; aspoignantly summarised by Rachel Carson in Silent Spring,> “Like the constant dripping of water that in turn wears away the hardest> stone, this birth-to-death contact with dangerous chemicals may in the end> prove disastrous. Each of these recurrent exposures, no matter how slight,> contributes to the progressive build-up of chemicals in our bodies and so to> cumulative poisoning.”The solution to any problem must begin with knowledge of its existence and anunderstanding of its nature, both of which are sadly lacking in the informationprovided by the medical establishment about MCS. However, chemicals are not theonly sources of harmful exposures that cause ill-health, as the followingdiscussion will demonstrate.Electromagnetic HypersensitivityElectromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS), like MCS, is a condition that affects agrowing number of people around the world; it is also a condition for whichthere is no establishment definition.The 2005 WHO Backgrounder article entitled Electromagnetic fields and publichealth, referred to in the previous discussion, provides an overview of EHS andstates that,> “EHS is characterized by a variety of non-specific symptoms, which afflicted> individuals attribute to exposure to EMF.”The article is a brief summary of the findings from a WHO Workshop held in 2004.Full details of the workshop have been published in a report entitledElectromagnetic Hypersensitivity, which recognises that,> “Whatever its cause, EHS is a real and sometimes disabling problem for the> affected persons.”The report, which will be referred to in this discussion as the Workshop report,describes some of the allegedly ‘non-specific’ but very real symptoms thatinclude,> “…nervous symptoms like headache, fatigue, stress, sleep disturbances, skin> symptoms like prickling, burning sensations and rashes, pain and ache in> muscles and many other health problems.”The medical establishment clearly recognises the existence of these symptoms butrefutes their attribution to EMF exposures. The Workshop report refers to theterm ‘IEI’ (Idiopathic Environmental Intolerance) as preferable to ‘EHS’,because the latter term implies the existence of a causal relationship, whereas,according to the Summary in the Workshop report,> “…there is presently no scientific basis to link IEI symptoms to EMF> exposure.”Yet again, nothing could be further from the truth.The discussion in chapter six about non-ionising radiation showed that researchhad been conducted in the post-WWII period to investigate the effects ofexposures to radar and that, at the time, tissue heating was considered to bethe only effect. Subsequent research discovered that adverse effects occurred atexposures to radar far below that at which tissues were heated. One notableresearch study, conducted by Dr John Heller and his colleagues at the NewEngland Institute for Medical Research, is reported by Dr Robert Becker in his1985 book The Body Electric: Electromagnetism and the Foundation of Life, inwhich he states that the researchers,> “...found major chromosome abnormalities in garlic shoots irradiated with low> levels of microwaves. They soon found the same changes in mammalian cells...”In his 1990 book Cross Currents: The Perils of Electropollution, The Promise ofElectromedicine, Dr Becker discusses many studies that have reported a number ofdetrimental health effects resulting from exposures to various forms of EMradiation. Some of those studies relate to effects that will be discussed inlater sections of this chapter, particularly those that involve birth defectsand cancer.It is clear therefore, that scientific evidence to the contrary existed longbefore 2004 when the Workshop report made the claim that there was ‘noscientific basis’ for exposures to EMFs to be causally linked to adverse healtheffects. Furthermore, the Workshop participants should have been aware that theIARC had classified ELF as a Group 2B carcinogen in 2002.Nevertheless, the WHO maintains the stance that tissue heating is the mainbiological effect of exposures to EMFs, despite the classification of RFR as aGroup 2B carcinogen in 2011. Although Group 2B relates to ‘possible’ humancarcinogens, it should be noted that cancer is not the only adverse healtheffect caused by exposures to non-ionising radiation. The web page entitledCurrent science on Electromagnetic Sensitivity: an overview refers to the 2011IARC decision on RFR and states that,> “Since then, the medical science has advanced significantly, with many> hundreds of scientific studies showing adverse health effects, including> Electromagnetic Sensitivity, at non-thermal levels.”The exposure levels to EMFs that are considered to be ‘safe’ are set by ICNIRP(International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection), anon-governmental organisation that was chartered in 1992. The 1973 IRPA(International Radiation Protection Association) Congress led to the formationof INIRC (International Non-Ionizing Radiation Committee) in 1977 and to ICNIRPfifteen years later. The structure of ICNIRP includes a central Commission and a‘Scientific Expert Group’; these groups are comprised of scientists from varyingdisciplines, including medicine and biology. The aim of ICNIRP is stated to be,> “…to protect people and the environment against adverse effects of> non-ionizing radiation.”The ICNIRP scientists examine and review existing scientific literature fromwhich they determine appropriate exposure limits. According to the WHO web pageentitled Standards and Guidelines,> “…EMF exposures below the limits recommended in the ICNIRP international> guidelines do not appear to have any known consequence on health.”This claim is unfounded; there is an abundance of evidence that demonstrates theexistence of harm to health caused by EMF exposures at levels significantlylower than those determined by ICNIRP to be ‘safe’. In addition to the workperformed by ICNIRP, is that of the International EMF Project, which was createdby the WHO in 1996. This project, according to the WHO Standards page,> “…provides a unique opportunity to bring countries together to develop a> framework for harmonisation of EMF standards…”The aim of the EMF Project is,> “…to assess the scientific evidence of possible health effects of EMF in the> frequency range from 0 to 300 GHz.”The most recent information on the WHO website about the adverse health effectsfrom exposures to EMFs, is the October 2014 fact sheet entitled Electromagneticfields and public health: mobile phones, which states that,> “To date, no adverse health effects have been established as being caused by> mobile phone use.”This claim is refuted by the Group 2B classification of RFR in 2011; this is yetanother example of the contradictions contained within the informationpromulgated by the medical establishment.The bioelectrical system of the human body and the effects caused by exposuresto external EMFs are explained by Dr Neil Cherry PhD in his 2000 paper entitledEvidence of Health Effects of Electromagnetic Radiation, To the AustralianSenate Inquiry into Electromagnetic Radiation,> “We have natural EMR-based communication systems in our brains, hearts, cells> and bodies. External natural and artificial EMR resonantly interacts with> these communication systems altering hormone balances and damaging organs and> cells.”Dr Cherry specifically discusses the sensitivity of the heart and the brain toexternal electrical and electromagnetic influences and states that,> “The brain and the heart are especially sensitive because they mediate and> regulate primary biological functions that are vital to life…”The effects on the heart from EMF exposures can manifest as health problemsdiagnosed as CVDs, as previously discussed. The effects on the brain canmanifest as a number of symptoms, including those described as ‘nervoussymptoms’ by the Workshop report.The level of electromagnetic pollution has risen phenomenally in the past fewdecades. Unfortunately, this level is anticipated to continue to worsen, notonly as the result of increased demand for existing applications, such as mobilephones and wireless communications, amongst others, but more specifically, asmentioned in chapter six, for the new 5G systems that are to be introducedglobally in the 2020s. There are, however, increasing efforts to introduce 5Gahead of schedule.A January 2017 IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) article,entitled Everything You Need to Know About 5G, states that 5G is needed tohandle the increasing volume of traffic required for the ‘Internet of Things’,which mainly refers to ‘SMART’ technologies. One of the innovations of 5G is theuse of millimetre waves that operate in the frequency range between 30 and 300GHz, which is a major sector of the frequency range under review by the EMFProject. The article states that,> “Until now, only operators of satellites and radar systems used millimetre> waves for real-world applications.”As also mentioned in chapter six, the technologies proposed for 5G are virtuallyuntested. On the basis that existing electromagnetic technologies that wereclaimed to be ‘safe’ have been proven to be otherwise, the proposed newtechnologies have raised a considerable level of concern amongst scientists andphysicians who are already aware of the existing level of harm caused by EMFexposures. As mentioned in chapter six, Dr Devra Davis PhD founded the EHT(Environmental Health Trust) in 2007; the EHT website contains usefulinformation about the hazards of EMF exposures. With particular reference to 5G,a September 2017 article entitled Scientists And Doctors Demand Moratorium on 5Gstates that,> “Over 180 scientists and doctors from 35 countries sent a declaration to> officials of the European Commission today demanding a moratorium on the> increase of cell antenna for planned 5G expansion.”The article refers to a study by the US NTP (National Toxicology Program), whichhas been conducted to determine the effects of mobile phone radiofrequencies onrats and mice, and states that some of the early results show,> “…statistically significant increases in the incidence of brain and heart> cancer in animals exposed to cellphone radiation at levels below international> guidelines.”There is an increasing level of awareness amongst many scientists and physiciansthat exposures to both EMFs and toxic chemicals are responsible for many healthproblems. This awareness has encouraged an increased demand for ‘official’recognition of EHS and MCS as genuine health problems; as indicated by a 2015article entitled Reliable disease biomarkers characterizing and identifyingelectrohypersensitivity and multiple chemical sensitivity as two etiopathogenicaspects of a unique pathological disorder by Professor Dominique Belpomme MD andhis colleagues. The article demonstrates that EHS and MCS are not ‘idiopathic’but genuine medical conditions.The study referred to in the article identified certain significant symptomsexperienced by many patients who suffer from either EHS or MCS or both; thesewere inflammation, oxidative stress and reduced melatonin levels. The coincidingsymptoms of oxidative stress and inflammation are a common feature of manyill-health conditions; the latter is discussed in more detail later in thischapter. Melatonin is an extremely important hormone that regulates a number ofvital functions, one of which is sleep; low melatonin levels are thereforedirectly related to sleep disturbances, one of the symptoms recognised by theWorkshop report. Dr Cherry’s 2002 article about reduced melatonin levels causedby EMF/EMR exposures, which was discussed in chapter six, referred to some ofthe more serious health effects that can result from such exposures.At a meeting in May 2011, a delegation of scientists and physicians, includingProfessor Belpomme, presented a petition to the WHO requesting the officialrecognition of MCS and EHS as genuine environmental illnesses; this petitionfailed to influence the WHO. Another petition, presented to the medicalestablishment in 2015, also requested a change to the official position on EHSand MCS. This petition had arisen as a result of the Fifth Congress of the ParisAppeal held in Brussels. Another result of the Congress was the production ofthe 2015 Brussels International Scientific Declaration on EHS & MCS, whichstates that,> “Following the fifth Paris Appeal Congress, the attending European, American> and Canadian scientists unanimously decided to write a Common International> Declaration to request an official recognition of these new diseases and of> their sanitary consequences worldwide.”The press release that accompanied this Declaration states that,> “The declaration calls upon national and international bodies and institutions> and particularly the WHO, for taking urgently their responsibility for> recognizing electrohypersensitivity and multiple chemical sensitivity as real> diseases...”It would seem that this request also failed to influence the WHO; the stance ofmost of the medical establishment towards EHS and MCS remains unchanged; asindicated by the lack of a WHO fact sheet relating to either of theseconditions.The refusal to acknowledge that these conditions represent genuine healthproblems means that physicians are not trained to recognise or understand thesystemic problem with which their patients suffer; instead physicians are onlyable to offer ‘treatments’ for their symptoms. This means that headaches will betreated with painkillers; sleep difficulties with sleeping tablets orbenzodiazepines; and depression with antidepressants. However, none of thesepharmaceutical drugs is capable of addressing symptoms that have been caused byexposures to EM radiation or to toxic chemicals, or, as is invariably the case,to both.As stated, the human body functions bioelectrically and biochemically; however,these systems function interdependently, which means that chemicals affect thebioelectrical system and EMFs affect the biochemical system. The effects ofexposure to EM radiation on the body’s production of melatonin exemplifies thisinterconnectedness; the close similarities between EHS and MCS should thereforenot be surprising.The discussion about EMFs in chapter six demonstrated the influence of vestedinterests, especially the military, to suppress information about the adversehealth effects from various technologies and the electromagnetic radiation theyproduce. This influence was recognised by Dr Becker in The Body Electric, inwhich he states that,> “Because industry and the military demand unrestricted use of electromagnetic> fields and radiation, their intrinsic hazards are often compounded by secrecy> and deceit.”The ‘industry’ vested interests are mainly those involved in telecommunicationsand electronic technologies, which, together with the military, seem to exert apowerful influence over ICNIRP and the WHO, both of which deny the existence ofproven harm to health; as demonstrated by the Electromagnetic Sensitivity webpage about Current Science that states,> “A small number of scientists, mainly physicists and those linked with the> radio industry and its regulators, such as some members of ICNIRP and WHO EMF> Project, still cling to the long invalidated hypothesis of no harm.”The continually increasing level of electropollution in the environment requiresawareness of the problem and the understanding that the WHO, despite its claimto be the ‘authority’ for health matters, fails to acknowledge the huge weightof evidence of harm caused by unnatural EM radiation. The fact that some peopleare more affected by certain influences than others does not provide an excuseto avoid recognition of the problem or to imply that they may be suffering froma ‘psychiatric’ condition, as suggested by the Workshop report in the statementthat,> “There are also some indications that these symptoms may be due to> pre-existing psychiatric conditions as well as stress reactions as a result of> worrying about believed EMF health effects, rather than the EMF exposure> itself.”This attitude is egregious; however, there is an increasing emphasis on ‘mentalhealth’ problems and diagnoses of a variety of ‘mental disorders’ that are usedto describe a wide range of emotional, but entirely normal, responses to thestresses of life. This important topic has been mentioned in chapter one, butwill be further explored in chapter ten.The adverse health effects from exposures to electromagnetic radiation are real,there are, however, some measures that can be taken to reduce exposures to EMFsand to ameliorate their effects; these are also discussed in chapter ten.Gulf War SyndromeThe establishment definition of Gulf War Syndrome (GWS) refers to the conditionas,> “a variety of symptoms, mainly neurological (including chronic fatigue,> dizziness, amnesia, digestive upsets and muscle wasting) that have been> attributed to exposure of armed forces personnel to chemicals (e.g.> insecticides) used during the Gulf War (1991) or possibly to the effects of> vaccines and tablets given to protect personnel against the anticipated threat> of chemical and biological warfare during the conflict.”The wording of this definition conveys the impression that these ‘chemicals,vaccines and tablets’ have not been definitively proven to be relevant causalfactors for the symptoms experienced by armed forces personnel; this is however,a mistaken impression. There is demonstrable evidence that these factors haveplayed a direct and highly significant role in the debilitating illnessexperienced by veterans of the 1990/91 Gulf War.The military personnel involved in this conflict were not solely American;however, the website of the US VA (Department of Veteran Affairs) providesinformation about GWS, including a definition of the condition and some of thesymptoms suffered; it states, on the page entitled Gulf War Veterans’ MedicallyUnexplained Illness, that,> “A prominent condition affecting Gulf War veterans is a cluster of medically> unexplained chronic symptoms that can include fatigue, headaches, joint pain,> indigestion, insomnia, dizziness, respiratory disorders and memory problems.”The use of the term ‘medically unexplained’ to describe the conditiondemonstrates that the medical establishment attitude towards GWS bears astriking resemblance to their attitude towards MCS and EHS; GWS requires furtherexamination.On the VA web page entitled Gulf War Exposures, is a list of 13 ‘potential’hazards that troops may have encountered; these hazards include: vaccinations,pyridostigmine bromide, pesticides, chemical and biological weapons, depleteduranium and occupational hazards. For each hazard there are additional web pagesthat provide more detailed information. Whilst it is unlikely that militarypersonnel would have been exposed to all 13 hazards, there is one hazard towhich they were certainly all subjected. All military personnel received anumber of vaccinations; these are described on the web page devoted to the topicas,> “Standard series of inoculations against infectious diseases provided to any> US citizen travelling to the Gulf.”Although this ‘standard series’ is not explicitly detailed, the vaccinesadministered are stated to have included: yellow fever, typhoid, cholera,hepatitis B, meningitis, whooping cough, polio and tetanus. Some troops receivedadditional vaccines for anthrax and botulinum toxoid, neither of which are partof any ‘standard’ vaccines for travellers.On the Institute of Science in Society website is a July 2003 article entitledVaccines, Gulf-War Syndrome and Bio-defence by Dr Mae-Wan Ho PhD and ProfessorMalcolm Hooper PhD, who report that UK troops received an additional vaccine; anexperimental one for ‘plague’. The article also states that,> “Vaccine overload was identified as a significant factor in GWS.”In addition, the article states that the UK MoD (Ministry of Defence) claimsthat the troops were given 10 vaccines, but that,> “...records exist to show that some troops received a greater number.”The previous chapters about vaccinations and the ‘germ theory’ demonstrated thatnot only were all of the vaccinations unnecessary, but that together they wouldhave introduced a large volume of toxic material into the bloodstream of thesepeople; especially as multiple vaccines were often administered simultaneouslyor shortly after each other. The neurotoxic ingredients of most vaccines providean entirely adequate explanation for the onset of neurological problems.Pesticides are another of the hazards to which troops were exposed; the VA webpage lists 4 types: methyl carbamate organochlorine pesticides, DEET,organophosphorus (OP) pesticides and pyrethroid pesticides. Lindane, which is amethyl carbamate organochlorine pesticide, was used to treat uniforms. DEET(diethyltoluamide) is a common insect repellent that is applied directly ontothe skin. Pyrethroid pesticides, such as permethrin, were also used to treatmilitary uniforms. As discussed, pesticides are toxic by nature and by intent.Although they have not been fully tested in combination to determine theexistence of all possible synergistic interactions, there are some chemicalcombinations that have been proven to substantially enhance the combinedtoxicity. The authors of Killer Clothes discovered evidence of the existence ofsynergies as the result of tests conducted on certain substances, includingthose to which the military personnel were exposed,> “...researchers had discovered that permethrin interacts synergistically with> DEET and other chemicals resulting in severe health problems being produced in> lab animals.”As discussed in chapter five, animals are not suitable experimental models forhumans, but this does not mean that evidence of harm to animals can be ignored.Any substance that causes harm to animals must be regarded as having thepotential to be harmful to humans; it is, after all, the purpose of animalexperiments to ascertain if a substance has the potential to cause adverseeffects. Unfortunately, however, animal testing research studies tend to focuson the determination of ‘safe’ doses rather than the investigation of the fullextent of the adverse health effects that substances may produce.Another item on the list of hazards is pyridostigmine bromide (PB), which is apharmaceutical drug that is said to provide a measure of protection against thehighly toxic nerve gas ‘Soman’, when taken prior to exposure and in conjunctionwith certain antidotes that are taken after exposure. Soman is anorganophosphate compound; it is referred to as an acetylcholinesterase (AChE)inhibitor. PB is also an AChE inhibitor, although the effect of the drug isclaimed to only be temporary.The reference to organophosphate pesticides in chapter six explained thatcholinesterase is an important enzyme required for the normal functioning of thehuman nervous system. The inhibition of this enzyme has serious consequences, asexplained by Dr Russell Blaylock in Health and Nutrition Secrets,> “When cholinesterase is deactivated, acetylcholine over-stimulates muscles,> resulting in an inability to control movements.”Gulf War personnel were clearly exposed to a number of compounds that acted asAChE inhibitors; a situation that provides another adequate explanation for someof the neurological symptoms they experienced.Despite the recognition that military personnel were exposed to variouscombinations of many different hazardous substances, the medical establishmentmaintains that no ‘medical explanation’ exists for the symptoms that veteranscontinue to experience. The medical establishments of the US and the UK areparticularly fervent in retaining a stance that denies the existence of anylinks between these hazards and GWS.The attitude of the US establishment is represented by HMD (the Health andMedicine Division of the NAS), formerly known as IOM (Institute of Medicine), ina 2010 report entitled Health Effects of Serving in the Gulf War. The conclusionto the report is stated to be that,> “...current available evidence is not sufficient to establish a causative> relationship between chronic multisymptom illnesses and any specific drug,> toxin, plume or other agent, either alone or in combination.”The position of the UK government is expressed on the page entitled Gulfveterans’ illnesses, which refers to an independent review conducted by the MRC(Medical Research Council) in 2003 and states,> “The MRC report stated that no evidence of a unique syndrome had been found in> this country or abroad following research of troops deployed to the Gulf.”These statements highlight the many problems associated with all conditions ofthis nature; one of which is the idea that a ‘unique syndrome’ must beidentified in order for a variety of symptoms to be ‘officially’ recognised as amedical condition. Another is the often-repeated claim that there is‘insufficient evidence’ of a causal relationship.By contrast to the medical establishment stance, a November 2008 report entitledGulf War Illness and the Health of Gulf War Veterans, published by the ResearchAdvisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans’ Illnesses, discusses differentinterpretations of the term ‘unique syndrome’ and states that,> “However the question of a unique syndrome is interpreted, extensive> descriptive and analytic research has clearly demonstrated that an illness,> characterized by a complex of multiple systems, resulted from service in the> Gulf War.”The report also states under the heading Findings in Brief that,> “Gulf War illness is a serious condition that affects at least one fourth of> the 697,000 US veterans who served in the 1990-1991 Gulf War.”It should be clear that it does not require the existence of a ‘unique syndrome’to recognise that more than a hundred thousand men and women currentlyexperience serious and debilitating health problems due to certain aspects oftheir involvement in that conflict.The failure of the medical establishment to acknowledge the connection betweenthe exposures of military personnel to hazardous substances and their ill-healthdoes not mean that the problem does not exist.The reasons that the medical establishment continues to maintain this positionwith respect to GWS are based on factors that include the controlled‘conventional’ medical training of physicians and the centralised diseaseclassification system of the ICD. This attitude also owes its existence to thepowerful influence of vested interests, especially the military, that seek toprevent public awareness of the real nature of the problem, partly due to theirfear of a public outcry and the resulting demand for compensation. This problemis discussed in Chemical Exposures,> “In the United States, legal action or liability concerns unfortunately drive> much of the acerbic rhetoric and distortions of science that retard the> advancement of understanding about chemical sensitivity. The same is also true> in parts of Europe, notably Germany and the United Kingdom.”Although this explanation refers to MCS, it can be seen to also apply to GWS.These fears are, however, only some of the reasons that vested interests withinindustry and the military seek to prevent a full level of public understandingabout the effects of their activities on the health of the public and theenvironment.Autoimmune DiseasesAn ‘autoimmune disease’ is defined by the establishment as,> “one of a number of otherwise unrelated disorders caused by inflammation and> destruction of tissues by the body’s own immune response.”It is claimed that there are in excess of 80 different autoimmune diseases;however, although considered to be ‘otherwise unrelated’, they are said to sharea common feature of an absolutely fundamental nature. They are all claimed toresult from the loss of the immune system’s ability to distinguish between thebody’s cells and those of an ‘invader’; a situation that causes the immunesystem to attack and even destroy the body’s own cells and tissues ‘by mistake’.It would seem therefore that, according to the medical establishment, the humanbody is not only a passive receptacle that is attacked by disease, but it alsomakes mistakes and is capable of self-destruction.Nothing could be further from the truth.The medical establishment theories relating to autoimmune diseases are fraughtwith problems, the main one of which is that these theories are dependent uponerroneous ideas about the immune system, the existence of which is predicatedupon the ‘germ theory’; a theory that has been shown to be fatally flawed.The rigid adherence to a flawed theory will inevitably result in a failure tounderstand and correctly interpret circumstances observed in the real world.This is particularly noticeable in the failure to understand and correctlyinterpret ill-health conditions diagnosed as autoimmune diseases. The medicalestablishment does however, admit to a poor level of understanding about thesediseases; as acknowledged on the NIAMS (National Institute of Arthritis andMusculoskeletal and Skin Diseases) web page entitled Autoimmune Diseases thatstates,> “No one is sure what causes autoimmune diseases.”Nevertheless, despite this paucity of knowledge, the medical establishmentrefers to certain ‘factors’ that are claimed to play influential roles in theonset of autoimmune diseases; the NIAID (National Institute of Allergy andInfectious Diseases) web page entitled Autoimmune Diseases states that,> “Although the causes of many autoimmune diseases remain unknown, a person’s> genes in combination with infections and other environmental exposures are> likely to play a significant role in disease development.”The idea that ‘genes’ or ‘infections’ are relevant factors to the onset of anydisease has been shown to be unfounded; the role of environmental factors is,however, certainly significant, as will be discussed.The theories underlying ‘autoimmunity’ were recognised to be problematic morethan two decades ago by Dr Peter Duesberg, who states in his 1996 book Inventingthe AIDS Virus that,> “The autoimmunity hypothesis, however, suffers several fatal flaws.”He proceeds to explain some of those flaws,> “For one thing, autoimmune reactions have been poorly documented in any> disease, not to mention AIDS. In fact, they may never occur in an otherwise> healthy person. Moreover, the immune system works so well precisely because it> has built in (but poorly understood) safeguards that prevent it from attacking> its own host body…”The immune system is comprised of a number of organs, each of which has specificfunctions; however, according to the medical establishment, the main function ofthe ‘immune system’ is to detect, fight and kill invading pathogens. Thediscussions in chapter three demonstrated that none of the immune system’sfunctions involves the destruction of microbial invaders. As also previouslydiscussed, some organisms can ‘invade’ the body, but they only do so undercertain conditions, which, as Dr Duesberg indicates, do not occur in anotherwise healthy person; parasites are discussed in more detail in chaptereight.The human body is not inert; it does not make mistakes nor does it try todestroy itself. On the contrary, the human body is a complex, self-regulatingorganism that constantly seeks to attain and maintain itself in the state ofhealth, and, when harmed, it will make every effort to repair the damage andheal itself.The establishment definition claims that autoimmune diseases are caused byinflammation; but the establishment defines inflammation as,> “the body’s response to injury, which may be acute or chronic.”The definition explains that this response is a ‘defensive reaction’ thatenables healing to take place after injury. The medical establishment thereforeappears to attribute two entirely conflicting roles to inflammation; one that isprotective and another that is destructive. This is clearly anomalous; but it isan anomaly that has arisen from a fundamental misunderstanding about theprocesses that induce inflammation. In Natural Hygiene: Man’s Pristine Way ofLife, Herbert Shelton explains that inflammation is protective; it produces anincreased blood supply that delivers ‘repair materials’ to the affected area andenables healing to take place. He further explains that,> “Inflammation, whether in a wound or in a so-called disease, is a remedial, a> reparative and, also, a defensive process.”Under normal circumstances the inflammation processes will cease when the repairhas been achieved; however, if the damage is extensive and the repair processesare prolonged, inflammation will also be prolonged and may cause damage to theaffected tissues. This is explained by Herbert Shelton, who states that,> “Death or mortification of the inflamed part represents the unsuccessful> termination of the remedial effort.”It is clear therefore, that the processes that initiate inflammation are notintentionally destructive, and that damage only occurs when the underlyingproblem has not been resolved. The most common underlying cause of inflammationis the presence of ‘poisons’, as he further explains,> “Inflammation in any part of the body arises out of the same cause – toxemia.”The claim that toxins cause inflammation and can induce symptoms associated with‘autoimmune diseases’ is corroborated by Hal Huggins and Dr Thomas Levy, whoexplain in Uninformed Consent that certain toxic substances are specificallyused for autoimmune disease animal research studies. The reason that these toxicsubstances are used, is because they are known to induce conditions in animalsthat approximate to those observed in humans diagnosed with certain autoimmunediseases. It should not be surprising to discover that mercury is one of thetoxic substances used for the purposes of inducing some of the relevantconditions in animals.Another toxic substance used in autoimmune disease research is a chemicalreferred to as TMPD (tetramethylpentadecane), which is described by the chemicalindustry as ‘a hydrocarbon oil adjuvant’ and promoted for its ability to act asan ‘autoimmune disorder induction reagent’. The use of hydrocarbons for thispurpose is discussed in a March 2010 article entitled Toxicology of AutoimmuneDiseases that states,> “The adjuvant properties of certain hydrocarbons can precipitate inflammatory> or autoimmune disease in humans and animals…”In addition, certain drugs are also known to induce or trigger an ‘autoimmune’response, as the article explains,> “The chemicals most often associated with development of autoimmunity in> humans are medications.”The article refers to a list of drugs that have been shown to induce certain‘SLE-like’ conditions; SLE is systemic lupus erythematosus, which is morecommonly referred to as lupus. Most significantly, the article concludes that,> “There is ample evidence that exposure to a variety of drugs and chemicals can> lead to autoimmunity.”A December 2002 article, entitled Environmental chemicals and autoimmunedisease: cause and effect, provides further supportive evidence of theassociation between certain medications and some autoimmune diseases, includinglupus. This association is not merely a ‘correlation’; the evidence indicates adirect causative relationship; as the article states,> “These are temporary conditions that resolve when the medication is removed.”The article continues with the comment that,> “There are now over 70 such medications which have been reported related to> these autoimmune conditions.”In common with many other types of disease, there are no ‘cures’ for autoimmunediseases; the medical establishment only offers drug ‘treatments’ that areclaimed to manage these conditions by alleviating symptoms. There are two typesof treatment; immunosuppressive drugs and anti-inflammatory drugs.Immunosuppressive drugs are used on the basis of the idea that the immune systemattacks the body’s own cells and tissues; but, as discussed, this is anerroneous idea. One of the immunosuppressant drugs prescribed for the treatmentof certain autoimmune diseases, particularly lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, isazathioprine. There are some serious ‘side effects’ associated with this drug,particularly low blood pressure and liver damage; the effects also includevomiting and diarrhoea, all of which are indicative of the drug’s toxicity andthe body’s efforts to expel it. Another immunosuppressive drug used in thetreatment of autoimmune disease is methotrexate, which is also used to treatcertain cancers. In addition to the ‘side effects’ of nausea and vomiting, thisdrug can adversely affect the blood and the liver; these effects are all clearindications of its toxicity.Immunosuppressive drugs are also used to prevent organ rejection after atransplant operation; however, a better solution needs to be sought for thisproblem because these drugs are toxic.The other type of treatment that may be prescribed for autoimmune diseases areanti-inflammatory drugs, which include NSAIDs and corticosteroids, but these arealso attended by serious adverse health effects. In Death by Modern Medicine, DrCarolyn Dean reports the result of a survey of French GPs which included thefinding that,> “Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) rank first among commonly> prescribed drugs for serious adverse events.”The fact that a large number of ‘medicines’ have been shown to induce healthproblems that can be diagnosed as ‘autoimmune conditions’ strongly indicatesthat pharmaceuticals, especially those derived from hydrocarbons, are entirelyinappropriate for the treatment of these conditions.Of further concern is that, despite their poor level of knowledge andunderstanding about autoimmune diseases and their causes, the medicalestablishment has created a new category of diseases referred to as‘auto-inflammatory diseases’, which are explained on a NIAMS web page entitledUnderstanding Autoinflammatory Diseases. On the web page it is claimed thatautoimmune diseases and autoinflammatory diseases are different, but sharecommon characteristics, which are,> “...that both groups of disorders result from the immune system attacking the> body’s own tissues, and they also result in increased inflammation.”The difference is claimed to be that,> “In autoinflammatory diseases, this innate immune system causes inflammation> for unknown reasons.”There is, however, little to differentiate between autoinflammatory diseases andautoimmune diseases, except for the claim that inflammation occurs for ‘unknown’reasons in the former. This is yet another unfounded claim, because the medicalestablishment has a poor understanding of inflammation. The creation of a newcategory of ‘diseases’ does not help to better understand these conditions,especially as they are based on a fundamentally flawed theory.The next few sections examine some of the more common ‘autoimmune diseases’ tofurther illustrate the medical misconceptions promulgated by the medicalestablishment about them.DiabetesThe establishment defines diabetes as,> “any disorder of metabolism causing excessive thirst and the production of> large volumes of urine.”The term ‘diabetes’ is, however, predominantly used to refer to the specificform of the condition known as ‘diabetes mellitus’, which is defined by theestablishment as,> “a disorder of carbohydrate metabolism in which sugars in the body are not> oxidised to produce energy due to lack of the pancreatic hormone insulin.”There are two types of diabetes mellitus, known as type 1 and type 2.Type 1 diabetes is regarded as the more severe condition because the body issaid to have lost the ability to produce insulin; this type of diabetes is saidto begin in childhood or adolescence.Type 2 diabetes is regarded as a metabolic disease that generally begins laterin life and is regarded as less severe than type 1.Mortality from diabetes is significant; it is the fourth most serious NCD andclaimed to be responsible for the worldwide loss of more than a million liveseach year. The incidence of diabetes has grown considerably in the past fewdecades, as indicated by the October 2018 WHO fact sheet entitled Diabetes thatstates,> “The number of people with diabetes has risen from 108 million in 1980 to 422> million in 2014.”It is claimed that type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease; there is however, alack of knowledge about certain aspects of this condition, as the fact sheetadmits,> “The cause of type 1 diabetes is not known and it is not preventable with> current knowledge”By comparison, it is claimed that the causes of type 2 diabetes are known andthat, according to the fact sheet, this type of diabetes is,> “…largely the result of excess body weight and physical inactivity.”The reasons for such a distinction between two forms of the same disease are notexplained.One point of particular concern is that type 2 diabetes is increasinglyprevalent among children, as the fact sheet indicates,> “Until recently, this type of diabetes was seen only in adults but it is now> also occurring increasingly frequently in children.”Although it is only type 1 diabetes that is categorised as an autoimmunecondition, there is a school of thought that suggests type 2 diabetes belongs inthe same category. This view is articulated by a June 2015 article entitled Areobesity-related insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes autoimmune diseases whichrefers to type 2 diabetes and CVD as ‘chronic metabolic disorders’ but makes thefamiliar statement that,> “Although these disorders affect a significant proportion of the global> population, the underlying mechanisms of disease remain poorly understood…”This poor level of understanding about type 2 diabetes would appear to beinconsistent with the assertion by the WHO that it is ‘largely’ the result ofoverweight and inactivity.In common with virtually all other diseases, the medical establishment can onlyoffer diabetes ‘treatments’; as described by the fact sheet,> “Diabetes can be treated and its consequences avoided or delayed with diet,> physical activity, medication and regular screening and treatment for> complications.”The severity of type 1 diabetes is due to the near or complete failure of thepancreas to produce insulin, an important hormone. It is claimed that the body’sinsulin deficiency can be rectified by injections that deliverpharmaceutical-based ‘insulin’ into the body. Until the 1980s, the insulin usedto treat diabetes was sourced from animals; it is now ‘human insulin’, which isdescribed on the web page entitled Human Insulin as,> “…the name which describes synthetic insulin which is laboratory grown to> mimic the insulin in humans.”This ‘human insulin’ is claimed to have certain drawbacks; a problem that hasbeen seemingly solved by the creation of ‘insulin analogues’. According to theweb page entitled Diabetes Education Online, these analogues mimic naturalinsulin,> “However, they have minor structural or amino acid changes that give them> special desirable characteristics when injected under the skin.”It should be clear that any changes, however minor, will result in a differentsubstance that is unlikely to act in exactly the same way that ‘natural’ insulinacts within the body.Although the WHO fact sheet claims that screening and treatments are effectivemeasures for monitoring diabetes, this claim is contradicted by a January 2017article entitled Efficacy and effectiveness of screen and treat policies inprevention of type 2 diabetes: systematic review and meta-analysis of screeningtests and interventions. The article states that the purpose of screening testsis to identify people who are ‘at risk’; it refers to two types of screeningtest currently in use and adds that one was found to be ‘specific but notsensitive’ and that the other type was found to be ‘neither specific norsensitive’. The article also states that interventions must be efficacious forthose who are considered to be ‘at risk’; the main interventions for type 2diabetes involve the use of pharmaceutical drugs. One such drug is metformin,about which an August 2015 article entitled A Comprehensive Review of Drug-DrugInteractions With Metformin states,> “Although it is an old drug, its mechanism of action has not yet been> clarified and its pharmacokinetic pathway is still not fully understood.”The purpose of the article was, as the title indicates, to review drug-druginteractions; nevertheless, this article contains a significant admission aboutthe lack of knowledge of one of the most commonly used ‘treatments’ for thisserious condition. The article admits to another problem with this drug which isthat,> “There is considerable inter-individual variability in the response to> metformin.”Although inexplicable to the medical establishment, there are understandablereasons for the variability in the responses to this drug and, in fact to alldrugs; these reasons are discussed in more detail in chapter ten.The reference in the WHO fact sheet to ‘overweight’ as a major factor indiabetes is misleading. Diabetes does not arise as a direct result of excessweight per se; it occurs as the result of the type of food consumed, amongstother factors. A diet that is mainly comprised of processed food products anddrinks that contain substantial amounts of toxic food additives, especiallyrefined sugar, will disrupt many of the normal functions of the body. The WHOdoes recognise that diet plays a role in diabetes, as indicated by the factsheet that states,> “Healthy diet, regular physical activity, maintaining a normal body weight and> avoiding tobacco use are ways to prevent or delay the onset of type 2> diabetes.”The fact sheet also recommends the avoidance of ‘sugar’, but fails todifferentiate between the different types of sugar, although these differenttypes are discussed in other fact sheets. The role of refined sugar in diabetesis significant, as it affects the body’s ability to regulate blood sugar levels,which is the main symptom experienced by people with diabetes, as Dr CarolynDean explains in Death by Modern Medicine,> “Eating a highly refined diet of white flour and white sugar> products...rapidly elevates blood sugar because these non-foods are quickly> absorbed as simple sugars into the blood stream.”This aspect of an unhealthy diet is insufficiently emphasised in the diabetesfact sheet; the possible reason for this omission is explained by Dr Dean,> “Both Canadian and American Diabetes Associations receive corporate funding> from food and drug companies.”This situation is not exclusive to Canada and America; it applies to any countryin which the population consumes a diet that is largely comprised ofmanufactured ‘food products’, which contain high levels of refined sugar as wellas other food additives. Dr Dean also refers to Dr Betty Martini, whose researchincluded the discovery that aspartame can also precipitate diabetes. It wouldtherefore, be a mistake to believe that the risk of diabetes can be reduced byreplacing foods and drinks that contain refined sugars with foods and drinksthat contain sugar-free sweeteners, especially aspartame.Two conditions that are also associated with diabetes are hyperglycaemia, whichis an excess of glucose in the bloodstream, and hypoglycaemia, which is adeficiency of glucose in the bloodstream; raised blood sugar is clearly not theonly relevant factor for the onset of diabetes. The underlying problemsassociated with this disease involve disruptions to the body’s metabolicprocesses; as Dr Russell Blaylock explains,> “...the body’s metabolism is seriously disrupted leading to significantly> increased free-radical generation and lipid peroxidation.”As previously discussed, free radicals are generated as the result of the body’snormal metabolic processes. These radicals only become a problem if they aregenerated at levels that exceed the body’s ability to neutralise them withantioxidants. However, free radicals are also produced in the body by many otherfactors, one of the most significant of which are toxic substances. Therelevance of toxicity in diabetes is recognised by Dr Henry Bieler, who explainsthat,> “In diabetics there is always a very toxic background and the thyroid gland is> usually over-stimulated.”The thyroid gland is one of the organs of the endocrine system, the functions ofwhich include the elimination of toxins from the body.It is clear that toxins of various types, including ‘refined’ sugar, play asignificant role in the onset of diabetes; the elimination of toxins from thediet would therefore significantly contribute to the amelioration as well as theprevention of this condition.Multiple SclerosisThe establishment definition of multiple sclerosis refers to this condition as,> “a chronic disease of the nervous system affecting young and middle-aged> adults. The myelin sheaths surrounding nerves in the brain and spinal cord are> damaged, which affects the function of the nerves involved.”This description conveys the impression that MS is a distinct and easilyidentifiable condition; however, according to the Multiple Sclerosis Society webpage entitled Signs and symptoms,> “MS is complex and has many symptoms.”In addition, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society web page entitled MultipleSclerosis FAQs states that,> “Diagnosing MS can be a challenging process. In early MS, symptoms may be> non-specific and suggestive of several disorders of the nervous system.”This diagnostic challenge is not restricted to MS, it applies to all autoimmunediseases, as indicated by a 2012 article entitled Linkage of Multiple Sclerosisand Guillain-Barre Syndrome: A Population-Based Survey in Isfahan, Iran thatstates,> “Autoimmune diseases are well known for being difficult to diagnose.”Guillain-Barré syndrome is discussed in the next section.On the MS Society Signs and symptoms page is the interesting comment that,> “There are also other conditions with similar symptoms to MS.”The discussion about MCS referred to similarities between many differentconditions; a group to which MS can be added for a number of reasons, not leastof which is the lack of knowledge about these diseases and their causes. Incommon with these conditions, MS is also claimed to be associated with a groupof ‘risk factors’; as indicated by the MS International Federation (MSIF) webpage entitled Causes that states,> “Researchers do not know what triggers the immune system to attack myelin, but> it is thought to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors.”The idea that ‘genetic factors’ are relevant to any autoimmune disease has beendiscussed and shown to be unfounded. By comparison, ‘environmental factors’ arerelevant; or, to be more precise, certain types of environmental factors aresignificant to the onset of certain MS symptoms.In addition, MS researchers claim that there are other factors that may‘trigger’ the condition but do not always lead to the onset of disease; however,these ‘triggers’ cannot be regarded as causal factors. A factor can only be‘causal’ if it is present in every single case, with no exceptions.In common with many of the diseases discussed in this chapter, the Mayo Clinicweb page entitled Multiple Sclerosis states that,> “The cause of multiple sclerosis is unknown.”Unfortunately, the absence of a known cause does not prevent the medicalestablishment making certain assertions about the condition, not least of whichis the claim that ‘infectious agents’ are some of the relevant ‘environmentalfactors’ involved. But this claim is unfounded; as acknowledged by the MSIFCauses page that states,> “Many microbes (particularly Epstein Barr virus) have been proposed as> potential triggers for MS, but none have been proven.”Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms associated with MS; however, the MSIFpage entitled Fatigue states that,> “The cause of fatigue in MS remains unknown.”Despite the many unknown aspects of MS, there are some characteristics of thiscondition that are known, and are therefore able to assist a betterunderstanding of the actual causes of some of the symptoms associated with it.The most significant feature of MS is that it is usually accompanied by damageto the myelin sheaths that protect nerve fibres. An understanding of this damagerequires reference to the body’s biochemical pathway called the methylationcycle, which is essential for a number of processes, one of which is thesynthesis of myelin basic protein.Methylation is a process in which a ‘methyl group’ is added onto anothermolecule; a methyl group is a carbon atom surrounded by three hydrogen atoms. DrAmy Yasko PhD explains the importance of methylation on her web page entitledThe Methylation Cycle,> “Methylation is involved in almost every bodily biochemical reaction and> occurs billions of times every second in our cells.”It is therefore abundantly clear that anything that disrupts methylation willhave serious consequences for the body’s biochemical reactions. Dr Yasko furtherexplains that two of the important bodily functions affected by the methylationcycle are detoxification and energy production. The existence of fatigue as acommon symptom of MS suggests that the body’s energy production system has beendisrupted; the link between methylation and MS is, however, even stronger thanmerely ‘suggestive’.It is claimed that MS is not only lifelong, but also a condition thatprogressively worsens over time and proceeds almost inevitably to increaseddisability. A 2012 article entitled Environmental Risk Factors for MultipleSclerosis: A Review with a Focus on Molecular Mechanisms states that there is noeffective treatment for this advanced stage of MS, but it also makes theinteresting comment that,> “It is hypothesized that loss of axons is the main mechanism underlying> progressive disability.”An axon is a nerve fibre that can have a myelin sheath. It has been known formore than two decades that axon damage is one of the main mechanisms involved inMS. Furthermore, aspartame has been implicated in triggering MS in some cases,as mentioned in chapter six. In his 2004 article entitled The Connection BetweenMS and Aspartame, Dr Russell Blaylock writes,> “As far back as 1996 it was shown that the lesions produced in the myelin> sheath of axons in cases of multiple sclerosis were related to excitatory> receptors on the primary cells involved called oligodendroglia.”One of the constituent molecules of aspartame is methanol, about which DrBlaylock states,> “Methanol is an axon poison.”Methanol is always metabolised into formaldehyde, which is highly toxic and aknown carcinogen.Dr Woodrow Monte PhD has also conducted research into the dangers of aspartameand written extensively on the subject. He dedicates one chapter of his bookentitled While Science Sleeps to the topic of MS; in this chapter he statesthat,> “...the myelin sheath can be damaged at multiple sites in the brain.”He provides a further explanation of the significance of this comment,> “Interestingly, these sites are identical to the sites affected during> methanol poisoning.”Unfortunately, but unsurprisingly, the manufacturers of aspartame vehementlydeny any connection between aspartame and MS; a denial that has been accepted bythe medical establishment and promulgated by the main MS organisations; asdemonstrated by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society page entitled DisprovedTheories that claims,> “No scientific evidence supports the claims that aspartame…causes MS.”This assertion is accompanied by the statement that more information isavailable from other sources that, ironically, include the website of‘Nutrasweet’, the manufacturer of one of the main aspartame-containingsweeteners. Information provided by the manufacturer of a product implicated inthe onset of MS cannot be considered independent or impartial.However, aspartame is not the only source of exposure to methanol; this chemicalis a common basic feedstock for materials that are used in the manufacture ofmany everyday products, as indicated by the Methanol Institute web page entitledThe Chemical that states,> “Methanol is a key component of hundreds of chemicals that are integral parts> of our daily lives.”The page also refers to the fact that methanol is involved in processes thatproduce formaldehyde for use in the manufacture of many different materials,including plastics, glues and resins, amongst others. On another MethanolInstitute page, entitled What is Methanol, is the statement that,> “Methanol is used to produce other chemical derivatives, which in turn are> used to produce thousands of products that touch our daily lives…”The products for which methanol is a feedstock include ‘health andpharmaceutical products’. Clearly, people can be exposed to methanol from manysources; the increasing incidence of multiple sclerosis should not therefore beentirely surprising.As discussed in chapter one, cholesterol is essential for a number of functions;an additional point of great significance in the context of MS is thatcholesterol is an essential constituent of myelin. Furthermore, cholesterol issoluble in methanol. This fact alone clearly demonstrates that exposure tomethanol poses a hazard not only to the cholesterol in the brain but also to thecholesterol in the myelin that protects nerves.The medical establishment claims that there is no cure for MS, but there are‘treatments’, which involve different types of pharmaceutical drugs. One MS drugis teriflunomide, which is referred to as an immunomodulatory drug as it is saidto affect the immune system. Its mechanism of action is explained by the MSSociety on the web page entitled Teriflunomide, which states that it,> “...inhibits the function of specific immune cells that have been implicated> in MS.”However, the page also makes the comment that,> “We don’t know exactly how teriflunomide works, but it dampens down> inflammation.”Inflammation is not the only symptom of MS and teriflunomide is not the onlydrug used to treat the condition; however, although research is said to beongoing, it mainly focuses on the creation of new drug treatments rather thanunderstanding and addressing the causes of MS.Some research involves the investigation of existing drugs used for otherconditions to determine if they may be effective in the treatment of MS. Onedrug that has been the focus of research of this nature is simvastatin, a statindrug commonly used to treat high cholesterol. It is claimed that simvastatinalso has ‘anti-inflammatory’ and ‘neuroprotective’ effects, which is the reasonit is undergoing investigation for its potential use in MS. A March 2014 studyarticle entitled Effect of high-dose simvastatin on brain atrophy and disabilityin secondary progressive multiple sclerosis claims that this drug was able toreduce brain atrophy.Simvastatin is associated with ‘side effects’ that include muscle pain,tenderness, weakness and cramps; some of the more serious ‘side effects’ includesevere muscle pain, rashes, and inflammation and pain in the blood vessels andjoints. It is a worrying situation that some of these ‘side effects’ are thesymptoms experienced by people diagnosed with multiple sclerosis; whichindicates that this drug cannot be a suitable ‘treatment’. The action of statindrugs and the hazards they pose were discussed in chapter one.It is clear that MS is another example of a condition that is largely the resultof exposures to toxic ‘environmental factors’ that disrupt the methylationcycle, which is responsible for regulating the body’s detoxification processes.The involvement of ‘toxicity’ as a key factor in MS means that one of the mosteffective methods for addressing this condition involves the reduction andelimination of exposures to toxic substances.Guillain-Barré SyndromeThe establishment definition of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) refers to,> “a disease of the peripheral nerves in which there is numbness and weakness in> the limbs.”The October 2016 WHO fact sheet entitled Guillain-Barré syndrome states that itis,> “…a rare condition in which a person’s immune system attacks the peripheral> nerves.”On the basis of this description, it is clear that GBS is considered to be anautoimmune disease. An alternative name for this condition is ‘post-infectivepolyneuropathy’, which indicates one of the main factors alleged to precede and‘trigger’ the onset of Guillain-Barré syndrome; as indicated by the fact sheetthat states,> “Guillain-Barré syndrome is often preceded by an infection. This could be a> bacterial or viral infection.”Although may viruses are claimed to precipitate GBS, the fact sheet focuses onthe ‘Zika’ virus, about which it states,> “In the context of Zika virus infection, unexpected increase in cases of> Guillain-Barré syndrome has been described in affected countries.”Zika virus is discussed in more detail later in this chapter in the sectionabout birth defects; it should, however, be noted that no viral infection is thecause of GBS.In common with most of the diseases discussed in this chapter, there are manyunknown aspects of GBS, including its cause; as indicated by the NINDS (NationalInstitute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke) Guillain-Barré Syndrome FactSheet that states,> “The exact cause of GBS is not known. Researchers don’t know why it strikes> some people and not others. It is not contagious or inherited.”The NINDS fact sheet offers more information about GBS and states that,> “In most cases of GBS, the immune system damages the myelin sheath that> surrounds the axons of many peripheral nerves; however, it also may damage the> axons themselves.”It is clear that GBS and MS share some common characteristics.Interestingly, the WHO fact sheet states that,> “Guillain-Barré syndrome may also be triggered by vaccine administration…”The reason for this comment stems from claims that GBS has been diagnosed afterthe administration of certain vaccinations, although the medical establishmentvehemently denies that this indicates a causal relationship. The CDC web pageentitled Guillain-Barré syndrome and Flu Vaccine states that the ‘backgroundrate’ of GBS is 80 to 160 cases per week; which would seem to contradict thenotion that it is ‘rare’. However, more pertinently, it is stated on the sameweb page that GBS may occur after a flu vaccination ‘on very rare occasions’.A 2009 article entitled Vaccines and Guillain-Barré syndrome refers to theunderlying aetiology of GBS as ‘not completely understood’ but that ‘immunestimulation’ is involved; the article continues with the comment that,> “Thus, since vaccines have an effect on the immune system it is biologically> plausible that immunizations may be associated with subsequent GBS.”Despite the recognition that an association is ‘plausible’, the article deniesthe existence of evidence that there is a proven causal relationship betweenthem. However, some cases reported to the VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event ReportingSystem) have involved a diagnosis of GBS following certain vaccinations. A 2011article entitled Guillain-Barré syndrome after Gardasil vaccination: data fromVaccine Adverse Event Reporting System 2006-2009 refers to the incidence ofpost-Gardasil GBS as being,> “...higher than that of the general population.”The fact that neurotoxic substances, such as aluminium, formaldehyde andmercury, are ingredients of vaccines offers a more than plausible explanationfor damage to nerves following the administration of certain vaccinations.The fact that GBS and MS both involve damage to the myelin sheath, although atdifferent sites, indicates that they share common characteristics. The articlethat discussed a ‘linkage’ between GBS and MS, referred to in the previoussection, indicates that the medical establishment regards these conditions asseparate disease ‘entities’ that do not exist concurrently in an individual;however, the article reports that,> “…our findings might be suggestive of a linkage between the two diseases.”Furthermore, the study reported that, although extremely rare, some cases ofconcurrent GBS and MS were found to exist. One of the main reasons that this isreferred to as a rare occurrence is the idea that MS and GBS are distinctlydifferent diseases. Furthermore, once a diagnosis of one condition has beenmade, it is unlikely that additional symptoms will be considered to indicate thepresence of a different disease. The diagnostic difficulties associated withboth conditions make it more than likely that additional symptoms will beregarded as a worsening of the original condition.In common with many conditions discussed in this chapter, there is no ‘cure’ forGBS, but the medical establishment can offer ‘treatments’, which unusually arerequired to be administered within a hospital setting. These treatments areintravenous immunoglobulin and plasma exchange, both of which are firmly basedon the theory that claims the disease is due to a faulty immune system thatattacks its ‘host’ body.It must be emphasised that, as will be discussed in chapter ten, the body is aself-healing organism; the perpetuation of the erroneous belief that it iscapable of attacking itself, even by mistake, poses a serious obstacle to agenuine understanding of any of the debilitating conditions referred to asautoimmune diseases.AllergiesThe establishment definition of an allergy refers to,> “a disorder in which the body becomes hypersensitive to particular antigens> (called allergens), which provoke characteristic symptoms whenever they are> subsequently inhaled, ingested, injected, or otherwise contacted.”The establishment defines an allergen as,> “any antigen that causes allergy in a hypersensitive person...”The establishment defines an antigen as,> “any substance that may be specifically bound by an antibody molecule...”The establishment defines an antibody as,> “a special kind of blood protein that is synthesized in lymphoid tissue in> response to the presence of a particular antigen...”Although these definitions explain some of the functions associated withallergies, they provide no information about the underlying mechanisms thatprecipitate ‘allergic’ reactions. The reason for this paucity of information isdue to the medical establishment’s poor level of understanding about allergies,as this discussion will demonstrate.Allergies are not classified as autoimmune conditions, but they are claimed toinvolve the stimulation of the immune system in response to ‘allergens’; asindicated by the NHS web page entitled Allergies, which, under the sub-headingWhat causes allergies, states that,> “Allergies occur when the body’s immune system reacts to a substance as though> it’s harmful.”Nevertheless, the NHS makes the significant admission that,> “It’s not clear why this happens…”The definition of ‘allergy’ claims that the body becomes ‘hypersensitive’, butfails to explain the mechanism that induces this ‘hypersensitivity’. Alsounexplained is the reason that some people suddenly develop allergic reactionsto substances to which they had never previously reacted.Another unexplained phenomenon is that only certain substances are referred toas ‘allergens’; as indicated by the AAAAI (American Academy of Allergy, Asthma &Immunology) web page entitled Allergic Reactions, which states that,> “It is not yet fully understood why some substances trigger allergies and> others do not…”It is claimed that contact with an ‘allergen’ stimulates the immune system toproduce antibodies known as Immunoglobulin E (IgE); yet people do not all reactin the same manner. The reasons that people react differently are largelyunknown, as revealed in a 2010 article entitled Mechanisms of IgE-mediatedallergy that states,> “Knowledge is still lacking about what causes some people to develop allergies> while others remain tolerant to environmental allergens.”The reference to ‘environmental allergens’ is misleading as the term impliesthat such substances would always trigger allergic reactions, but this isclearly not the case. This does not mean, however, that ‘environmental factors’are not relevant to the onset of reactions referred to as ‘allergies’, because,as this discussion will demonstrate, they are some of the main factors thatinduce these reactions.In common with most NCDs, the medical establishment claims that allergies arerelated to genetic or hereditary factors; as indicated by the previously citedNHS web page, which claims that,> “…most people affected have a family history of allergies…”This claim is unfounded; if the development of allergies were due to geneticfactors, the problem would occur from birth, or soon afterwards. The fact thatmany people develop ‘allergies’ much later in life refutes this idea.A further problem with the medical establishment view of allergies pertains tothe role attributed to IgE antibodies; as revealed in a 2012 article entitledIgE and mast cells in allergic disease that states,> “Despite many years of intense study, the roles of IgE and mast cells in> asthma and other allergic diseases are not fully understood.”It is clear that many aspects of ‘allergies’ remain unknown or not fullyunderstood; this situation owes its origin to erroneous ideas about the ‘immunesystem’ and its alleged functions. These erroneous ideas extend to the notionthat the immune system can make ‘mistakes’ about the nature of substances, withwhich it comes into contact, and treat harmless substances as if they areharmful.In common with many of the NCDs discussed in this chapter, allergies arereported to occur in continually increasing numbers; a situation that the NHSAllergies web page attempts to explain by the comment that,> “The reasons for this are not understood, but one of the main theories is it’s> the result of living in a cleaner, germ-free environment, which reduces the> number of germs our immune system has to deal with.”This ‘theory’, which is also referred to as the ‘hygiene hypothesis’, is highlymisleading. Although the environment can correctly be described as ‘germ-free’,because there are no real ‘germs’, this is not the meaning intended by the NHS,which, in common with all other mainstream medical organisations, adheresrigidly to the ‘germ theory’. Furthermore, as indicated in previous discussions,it is claimed that there are increasing numbers of ‘infectious diseases’ ofincreasing severity; this claim clearly and directly contradicts the idea thatthe environment is ‘germ-free’. The suggestion that the environment is ‘cleaner’can only be described as egregious; the discussions in chapter six demonstratethat the environment is becoming increasingly polluted; which means it isincreasingly less clean.The idea that the immune system reacts to substances ‘as if they are harmful’suggests that these substances are otherwise entirely ‘harmless’; however, thistoo is misleading. The web page provides a list of ‘common allergens’ and statesthat,> “Most of these allergens are generally harmless to people who aren’t allergic> to them.”This statement is highly unsatisfactory; it is essentially a circular argumentthat merely claims allergens are harmful to people who have allergies. But thisclearly fails to explain the reason that ‘allergic reactions’ occur in the firstplace, or the reason that the body treats otherwise harmless substances as ifthey are harmful. The failure of the medical establishment to provide a credibleexplanation does not, however, mean that a credible explanation does not exist.It should be noted that the list of ‘common allergens’ provided by the NHSincludes substances such as ‘medication’ and ‘household chemicals’. Part of theproblem therefore lies with the use of the term ‘allergen’ to describe suchsubstances, which, in most, if not all cases, should more correctly be describedas ‘toxins’.One of the most common types of ‘allergy’ is called ‘hay fever’; a conditionthat is also referred to as allergic rhinitis, which is defined by theestablishment as,> “a form of allergy due to the pollen of grasses, trees and other plants,> characterised by inflammation of the membrane lining of the nose and sometimes> of the conjunctiva.”The main types of treatment offered for allergic rhinitis are antihistamines,which are claimed to block the body’s production and release of histamine, achemical that is said to initiate irritation and inflammation. One of the major‘side effects’ of the first generation of antihistamine drugs was drowsiness,although these drugs were also associated with other effects such as impairedthinking and blurred vision. Second and third generation antihistamines are saidto be less likely to cause drowsiness, but are still associated with certain‘side effects’, such as headaches and nausea. Other treatments for allergicrhinitis include corticosteroids, which are anti-inflammatory drugs.Allergic rhinitis is claimed to be an ‘IgE mediated reaction’ that triggers therelease of histamine from mast cells, which are located in connective tissue.However, as cited above, the roles of IgE and mast cells remain poorlyunderstood; which therefore raises questions about the veracity of theexplanation for this condition and the appropriateness of the treatment.There is a credible explanation for the occurrence of ‘allergic rhinitis’ andone that does not involve unknown and unproven reactions by the immune system tosubstances that are arbitrarily referred to as ‘allergens’. This explanation isprovided by Dr Henry Bieler who states in Food is Your Best Medicine that,> “Hay fever develops after there is an atrophy of the nasal and sinus mucous> membranes.”Damage to the mucous membranes will therefore always precede the irritations andsymptoms that may be diagnosed as ‘hay fever’, as Dr Bieler continues,> “When there is no catarrhal state, there is no hay fever, no matter what> irritant is inhaled.”Although commonly associated with pollen, ‘hay fever’, like many other‘allergies’, is acknowledged to be ‘triggered’ by various substances, asindicated by the ACAAI (American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology) webpage entitled Allergic Rhinitis, which, under the sub-heading Symptoms, states,> “Symptoms also may be triggered by common irritants…”Some of these ‘common irritants’ are: cosmetics; laundry detergents; poolchlorine; and strong odours, such as perfume and hairspray. These ‘irritants’are strikingly similar to the substances described by the NHS as ‘commonallergens’. The body’s reaction to such substances should not be surprising; thediscussions in chapter six demonstrated that they all contain a variety ofchemicals, most of which are toxic. The body does not therefore, make a‘mistake’ in identifying these substances as harmful.Dr Bieler explains that mucus is a protective lubricant barrier for themembranes and that the body increases the production of mucus in certaincircumstances. One of these circumstances results from the inhalation of toxicchemicals, especially those of a volatile nature, which include certain chemicalingredients of household products, especially those referred to as ‘fragrances’.These chemicals can clearly induce nasal irritation and inflammation, which, ifprolonged because the underlying problem has not been resolved, will causefurther damage to the tissues. This is explained by Herbert Shelton, who, inNatural Hygiene: Man’s Pristine Way of Life, refers to catarrhal inflammationand calls it a ‘crisis in toxaemia’; he expands on this point and states that,> “Repeated for months and years, catarrhal inflammations end in chronic catarrh> of the nasal passages, ulceration, hay fever and other so-called nasal> diseases.”It is only the existence of this ‘toxaemic’ condition that precipitates theonset of the symptoms diagnosed as ‘allergies’; the absence of a toxaemiccondition provides a perfectly clear explanation of the reason that some peopleremain unaffected. However, the increasing use of toxic chemicals as ingredientsof most consumer products is one of the main reasons that the incidence ofallergies is increasing at an ever-faster rate. The solution to this probleminevitably involves reducing exposures to toxins.Another allergy that is also increasingly common, especially in children, is‘food allergy’, which, according to a 2011 article entitled Food allergy,affects approximately 6 per cent of young children; it is therefore asignificant problem. The article states,> “Food allergy is defined as an adverse immunologic response to a dietary> protein.”It is suggested that there are two types of food reaction; one is an allergy,the other an ‘intolerance’; the main difference between them is that an‘allergy’ involves an immune system response and is usually more severe.However, the article fails to explain the reason that the immune system reactsadversely to food proteins, which are an important category of essentialnutrients, especially for growing children. Furthermore, the ACAAI page entitledFood Allergy refers to the severity of each reaction as ‘unpredictable’ and addsthe interesting comment that,> “...a food that triggered only mild symptoms on one occasion may cause more> severe symptoms at another time.”The idea that the same ‘food’ may, at different times, produce reactions ofdiffering intensity indicates that the severity of the reaction cannot be anappropriate or reliable indicator of whether a reaction is an ‘allergy’ ratherthan an ‘intolerance’.FARE (Food Allergy Research and Education) discusses food allergy on the webpage entitled Food Allergy Research Funding and refers to it as a ‘disease’. Thepage also makes an increasingly familiar statement that,> “The numbers are growing and becoming more serious - but there is no clear> answer as to why.”The failure of the medical establishment to provide adequate explanations forthe increased incidence of reactions to foods does not mean that credibleexplanations do not exist. The discussion about hay fever referred to theexistence of an underlying toxicity; the same applies to food allergy, andindeed to all allergies. They always involve long-term exposure to various‘toxins’ that damage tissues, generate inflammation and result in increased‘sensitivity’ of the damaged tissues.Many of the toxins that are likely to contribute to ‘food allergy’ werediscussed in chapter six; the increasing use of synthetic chemicals as foodadditives in processed food products and drinks provides a more than adequateexplanation for this problem, and for its increased incidence especially inchildren; however, it must be noted that many other factors will also beinvolved; as discussed in chapter ten.The problem of ‘food allergy’ is unlikely to be addressed by the medicalestablishment whilst it maintains its current stance, and refuses to acknowledgethe extensive use of toxic chemicals in all areas of food production. Althoughthe NHS does not recognise the true nature or extent of the problem, the webpage makes the statement that,> “Almost any food can cause an allergic reaction...”Although reactions are claimed to occur from the consumption of ‘almost anyfood’, they will only occur from the consumption of foods that contain toxins ofsome description. It is therefore interesting to note that most ‘food allergies’are claimed to involve reactions to eight types of food, which are eggs, milk,peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, wheat and soy. One of the most common foodsassociated with adverse reactions are peanuts, the next topic of discussion.Peanut AllergyThere is no establishment definition for ‘peanut allergy’; however, a basicexplanation is provided by the Mayo Clinic web page entitled Peanut allergy thatstates,> “Peanut allergy occurs when your immune system mistakenly identifies peanut> proteins as something harmful.”As with all other allergies, the medical establishment does not know the reasonthat some people develop a reaction to peanuts whilst other people remainimpervious to them. It is, however, a matter of concern that the incidence ofthis particular ‘allergy’ has risen dramatically in the past few decades andmainly affects children; as indicated by the FARE web page entitled PeanutAllergy that states,> “According to a FARE-funded study, the number of children in the US with> peanut allergy more than tripled between 1997 and 2008.”This situation is not exclusive to the US; the scale of the problem in the US asdescribed by FARE is, however, of particular relevance to this discussionbecause peanuts have been consumed in America for more than a century; yetpeanut allergy is a relatively recent phenomenon.People with allergies are generally advised to avoid contact with the substancethat precipitates the onset of their symptoms. However, the findings of a newstudy indicate that this advice is likely to be significantly altered withrespect to peanut allergy. The NIAID (National Institute of Allergy andInfectious Diseases) issued a January 2017 news release entitled NIH-sponsoredexpert panel issues clinical guidelines to prevent peanut allergy that states,> “...recent scientific research has demonstrated that introducing peanut> containing foods into the diet during infancy can prevent the development of> peanut allergy.”The research referred to is the LEAP (Learning Early About Peanuts) studyconducted at King’s College London; the web page entitled LEAP Study resultsstates that,> “The LEAP study was based on a hypothesis that regular eating of> peanut-containing products, when started during infancy, will effect a> protective immune response instead of an allergic immune reaction.”The LEAP web page entitled Peanut Allergy claims that, according to manyscientists, repeated exposure to peanuts will create ‘tolerance’ to them. Thishypothesis is partly based on the observation that in countries where peanutsare commonly consumed at an early age, there is little, if any, peanut allergy.But this hypothesis directly contradicts the basic definition of a ‘foodallergy’ that refers to an adverse reaction to a food protein; peanuts are aprotein-based food. Furthermore, even in countries where peanut allergy is rife,many people consume peanuts without any adverse reactions to them; this alsorefutes the new hypothesis.It should be clear from the discussion in the previous section that otherfactors are required to initiate an adverse reaction to peanuts and that theseother factors invariably include a wide variety of ‘toxins’. It should also beclear that it is these toxins that are the cause of the body’s adverse reactionsdiagnosed as an ‘allergy’.Peanuts are not true ‘nuts’; they are legumes that grow underground and havesoft shells, unlike tree nuts that have hard shells.One of the causes of an allergic reaction to peanuts is claimed to be due to thepresence of the Aspergillus mould, which is said to release aflatoxins; but thismould will only develop if peanuts are grown or stored in damp conditions. Asdiscussed in chapter six, it is not the mould that is toxic. On the contrary,the presence of mould indicates that the peanuts have begun to decompose; whichmeans they are no longer fit for human consumption; it is therefore,unsurprising that people would become ill after consuming peanuts in thiscondition.There is another route by which peanuts can become ‘toxic’; this involves theliberal use of toxic pesticides on the peanut plants. Robyn O’Brien, a formerfood industry analyst, explains in her January 2019 article entitled FoodAllergies: The Hidden Truth About Peanuts that,> “Most of the peanuts consumed in the US are now one of the most> pesticide-contaminated snacks we eat.”Cotton is frequently grown in rotation with peanuts and pesticides are liberallyapplied to both crops; but this is not a recent practice; as explained by RachelCarson who wrote in 1962 that,> “The most stubborn problems were concerned with peanuts. In the southern> states peanuts are usually grown in rotation with cotton, on which BHC is> extensively used. Peanuts grown later in this soil pick up considerable> amounts of the insecticide.”BHC is benzene hexachloride; a toxic organochlorine that is chemically similarto lindane. The level of pesticide use on cotton plants is an extremely seriousproblem; the authors of Killer Clothes explain the reason and state that,> “Because cotton isn’t a food crop, the herbicides and pesticides and other> chemicals used in the production of non-organic varieties aren’t regulated by> the government.”Clearly, all peanut crops that are grown in rotation with cotton crops willbecome contaminated with the toxic chemical ingredients of pesticides, which areapplied frequently. Robyn O’Brien explains in her article that, according tofarmers,> “It is common to see a conventional peanut crop sprayed with some type of> pesticide every 8-10 days during the growing season.”Furthermore, cotton is commonly grown in the US as a GM crop, which maynevertheless be rotated with non-GM peanut crops. This means that the peanutcrops will also be exposed to soil residues of pesticides like glyphosate thatare applied liberally to GM cotton crops, which are claimed to be ‘resistant’ tothem. Non-GM peanut plants have no such resistance, but they are still exposedto soil residues of this highly toxic chemical that can be absorbed into theplants.Pesticides are not the only soil pollutant with which peanut and many otherplants can be poisoned; the discussions in chapter six identified many sourcesof soil contaminants that will increasingly affect all food crops. It istherefore unsurprising that there is an increasing incidence of adversereactions from the consumption of various foods; the scale of the problem isindicated by the FARE web page entitled Symptoms of an allergic reaction tofood, which states that,> “Every three minutes, a food allergy reaction sends someone to the emergency> room in the US.”It is clear that these reactions occur due to the existence of an underlyingbody burden of toxins that is exacerbated by the consumption of foodscontaminated by toxins. This further intake of toxins is likely to overwhelm thebody and reduce its ability to process and effectively expel the toxins; asituation that invariably results in an adverse reaction, which can vary inintensity, from mild to severe. The most serious reaction is known asanaphylaxis, which is potentially fatal.The most common ‘treatment’ for allergies is epinephrine, a drug that isdelivered by an ‘auto-injector’, which people with peanut allergy are advised tocarry with them at all times for immediate use in the event of a severereaction. This treatment is a synthetic substance derived from adrenaline(epinephrine), a natural hormone secreted by the adrenal glands. Although thisdrug is claimed to be life-saving in the event of an emergency, it does notsolve the underlying problem. It should be noted that, as previously discussed,synthetic hormones are not the same as natural hormones, however chemically‘similar’ they may be.Robyn O’Brien makes the particularly pertinent comment that,> “Children with food allergy are two to four times more likely to have other> related conditions, such as asthma and other allergies, compared with children> without food allergies.”The fact that these conditions are frequently concurrent indicates that theyhave common features, the main one of which is an underlying systemic toxicitythat makes the body ‘sensitive’ to further exposures to toxic substances.It should be clear therefore that the body does not mistakenly identify harmlessfoods as harmful; the reason that the body perceives certain foods to be‘harmful’ is because they are actually harmful due to the presence of toxicsubstances.EczemaThe establishment definition of eczema refers to,> “a common itchy skin disease characterized by reddening and vesicle formation,> which may lead to weeping and crusting.”The definition refers to eczema as endogenous; which means that,> “...outside agents do not play a primary role.”In addition, the definition states that the term ‘eczema’ is often usedinterchangeably with that of ‘dermatitis’, which is defined by the establishmentas,> “an inflammatory condition of the skin caused by outside agents.”These definitions suggest that the terms eczema and dermatitis are notsynonymous because one is endogenous and the other is not. This is, however,contradicted by the NIOSH web page entitled Skin Exposures and Effects thatdescribes eczema in the same terms as those used in the above definition ofdermatitis; as indicated by the reference to eczema as,> “an inflammation of the skin resulting from exposure to a hazardous agent.”Furthermore, the NEA (National Eczema Association) web page entitled An Overviewof the Different Types of Eczema claims that there are several different typesof eczema, four of which are listed as different forms of ‘dermatitis’.Nevertheless, the NEA web page makes the familiar claim that,> “…the exact cause of eczema is unknown…”The page contains another familiar claim, which is that,> “…researchers do know that people who develop eczema do so because of a> combination of genes and environmental triggers.”The most common form of eczema is referred to as ‘atopic eczema’, which is notregarded as an allergic condition but is considered to be ‘associated with’other allergic conditions, especially asthma, which is discussed in the nextsection. The term ‘atopic’ refers to a predisposition to develop an allergy,which suggests that this is a known phenomenon; however, the NHS web pageentitled Atopic Eczema claims that,> “The exact cause of atopic eczema is unknown...”This claim is disingenuous; the previously cited Dermal Exposure report not onlyrefers to factors that are known to cause ‘contact dermatitis’, one of the manyforms of eczema, it also states quite clearly that,> “Dermal exposure to chemical or physical agents may lead to skin disease.”The term ‘physical agents’ refers to factors that are said to include ionisingradiation and thermal burns.The report claims that there are two forms of ‘contact dermatitis’, one of whichis ‘irritant’ and the other ‘allergic’. Irritant contact dermatitis is claimedto be the most common occupational ‘skin disease’, whereas allergic contactdermatitis is claimed to be more common in the general population. But this ismisleading, as there is no real distinction between ‘irritants’ and ‘allergens’.This also means, therefore, that there are no distinctly different ‘forms’ ofcontact dermatitis or eczema; these conditions are all the result of skincontact with harmful substances.This assertion is supported by the statement in the Dermal Exposure report thatthe vast majority of cases of occupational ‘skin disease’ are the result ofcontact with chemicals or ‘wet work’; even though they are described as‘irritants’. Although the report insufficiently emphasises the role of chemicalsin precipitating skin diseases, it does make the statement that,> “…an irritant can damage the skin surface, leading to increased percutaneous> penetration of the same or other chemicals.”The permeability of the skin was discussed in chapter six.It is clear therefore, that ‘skin diseases’, whether referred to as eczema ordermatitis, are the result of contact with harmful substances, especially toxicchemicals, that damage the skin and can also enter the entire bodily system; asindicated by the report that states,> “A systemic effect can be observed in other organs or parts of the body after> the chemicals penetrate through the skin and enter the bloodstream.”The source of the problem is indicated by the previously cited Dermal Absorptionreport, which states that,> “...the prevalence of atopic dermatitis in industrialized countries is> dramatically increasing.”Many of the factors involved in ‘industrialisation’ will therefore becontributory factors to ‘skin diseases’. This assertion is further supported bythe above cited NIOSH web page that refers to exposures to ‘hazardous agents’ asthe cause of skin inflammation.Occupational exposures to hazardous chemicals, even though protective clothingis worn, are often more intense and more prolonged than domestic exposures. Thissituation is acknowledged by the NIOSH page entitled National OccupationalResearch Agenda, which, under the sub-heading Allergic and Irritant Dermatitis,states that,> “There is virtually no occupation or industry without potential exposure to> the many diverse agents that can cause allergic and irritant dermatitis.”Despite the claim that different forms of dermatitis exist, the web page makesan even more pertinent comment, which is that,> “Irritant contact dermatitis is the most common occupational skin disease,> usually resulting from toxic reactions to chemical irritants such as solvents> and cutting fluids.”The ingredients of solvents and cutting fluids include some extremely toxicchemicals that cannot be referred to as mere ‘irritants’.The connection between eczema and ‘industrialisation’ is also recognised by theNEA page entitled Eczema Causes and Triggers that lists a number of substancesreferred to as ‘common eczema irritants’; these include soaps and householdcleaners, amongst others. The connection between these ‘irritants’ and certainhealth problems is demonstrated by the example of triclosan, about which DrEpstein states in Toxic Beauty that,> “In humans this preservative chemical has been linked to allergies, asthma and> eczema.”It is clear that different conditions can be ‘triggered’ by the same toxicchemical, which indicates that they are not different diseases but, instead, areindicative of systemic ‘poisoning’ that can involve various symptoms indifferent parts of the body. It should be noted that a wide variety of chemicalsare capable of initiating the symptoms associated with these conditions.Some of the chemicals that can irritate the skin include those used to create‘fragrances’ for cosmetics, personal care products and household cleaningproducts. This has led to the creation of a new ‘disease’ referred to as‘perfume allergy’, which is said to be associated with both skin problems andrespiratory problems. When the symptoms affect the skin, the problem is called‘eczema’ and when the respiratory system is affected, it is called ‘asthma’. Asa consequence of their reactions to these chemicals, people are increasinglyadvised to avoid products that contain ‘perfume’ and to source ‘fragrance-free’products. Although this supports the assertion that ‘perfume’ chemicals areharmful to health, they are not the only chemicals capable of initiatingreactions.Eczema is claimed to be associated with a reaction of the immune system, but itis not currently regarded as an autoimmune disease; however, new researchindicates that this perspective may be changed. A December 2014 Mount SinaiPress Release entitled Atopic Dermatitis Found To Be an Immune Driven Diseasestates,> “For the first time, a team led by researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine> at Mount Sinai has proven that atopic dermatitis, also known as eczema, is an> immune-driven (autoimmune) disease at the molecular level.”The research was conducted using a drug treatment that is claimed to target,> “...specific immune proteins in atopic dermatitis.”There are a number of problems with the claims made as the result of thisresearch, not least of which is the failure of the medical research community toacknowledge that skin problems are known to be caused by contact with toxicchemicals. The failure of the research community to fully investigate theconnection between toxic chemicals and health problems has led to the situationrevealed by the Dermal Exposure report, which states that,> “For most chemicals, however, the relationship between dermal uptake and> health effects observed elsewhere in the body is still poorly understood.”A specific relationship does not need to be ‘understood’ in order forresearchers to recognise and acknowledge that toxic chemicals are hazardous tohealth. The safety testing procedures that are undertaken to determine a ‘safe’level of use for a toxic chemical provides clear evidence that these substancesare harmful; otherwise they would not need to be reduced to a ‘safe’ level. Theinfluence of the Paracelsus fallacy is yet again clearly discernible.In common with virtually all diseases, it is claimed that there is no ‘cure’ foreczema, but that there are ‘treatments’, which mainly involve steroid-basedmoisturising creams that may help to reduce inflammation and relieve dry skin.Although moisturisers may be able to relieve dry skin, any relief will only betemporary as these creams are unable to address the underlying problem. The mostcommon type of steroids used in these creams are corticosteroids, which aresynthetic versions of the hormone cortisol. These steroid-based creams areassociated with a number of ‘side effects’, one of which, according to the NHS,is a burning sensation; this would make it extremely uncomfortable, if notpainful, when this cream is applied to skin that is already sore.Antihistamine drugs may also be prescribed in addition to moisturising creams;these drugs and their effects have been discussed. In addition to creams anddrugs, people with eczema are advised to avoid substances that ‘trigger’ theircondition, but this advice needs to be extended to include contact with allproducts that contain toxic substances.It is clear that relief from eczema requires an understanding of the underlyingcauses; Dr Bieler provides the necessary clue in his statement that,> “Skin diseases...are really signs of toxic irritation...”This underlying ‘toxic irritation’ is a key feature of many of the healthproblems referred to as ‘allergies’, including asthma, as the discussion in thenext section will demonstrate.AsthmaThe establishment definition of asthma refers to,> “the condition of subjects with widespread narrowing of the bronchial airways,> which changes in severity over short periods of time (either spontaneously or> under treatment) and leads to cough, wheezing, and difficulty breathing.”In common with many conditions discussed in this chapter, the August 2017 WHOfact sheet entitled Asthma states that,> “The fundamental causes of asthma are not completely understood.”This is a significant admission, because the fact sheet also claims that,> “Asthma is one of the major noncommunicable diseases.”The fact sheet estimates that 235 million people worldwide suffer from asthma,but states that this condition is ‘under-diagnosed’. As indicated by thestatistics cited at the beginning of this chapter, respiratory diseases, whichinclude asthma, are claimed to be the third group of killer diseases worldwide.Unlike eczema, asthma is not claimed to manifest in a variety of differentforms; although the establishment definition refers to ‘bronchial asthma’,which, it claims,> “…may be precipitated by exposure to one or more of a wide variety of> stimuli…”This description does not seem to indicate that this is a distinctly differentform of asthma. It is interesting to note, however, that the ‘stimuli’ listed inthe definition include drugs, such as aspirin and other NSAIDs, as well as betablockers. This indicates that respiratory problems are not always due tosubstances that have been inhaled.The previous discussion indicated that a close connection exists between eczemaand asthma; this is recognised by a May 2009 article entitled Skin-Derived TSLPTriggers Progression from Epidermal-Barrier Defects to Asthma, which refers toeczema as AD (atopic dermatitis). TSLP stands for thymic stromal lymphopoietin.The article claims that both conditions are ‘allergic’ and states that,> “Importantly, a large proportion of people suffering from eczema go on to> develop asthma later in life.”Equally important is the failure of the medical establishment to understand thetrue nature of the connection between these conditions; the article states that,> “...the mechanism underlying the progression from AD to asthma...is unclear.”The idea that eczema ‘progresses’ to asthma is misleading. They are not separate‘conditions’; but the perception that there is a progression is indicative of anunderlying health problem that manifests as a skin condition known as ‘eczema’,which worsens and develops into a respiratory health problem known as ‘asthma’.It should be noted that the skin and lungs act as organs of elimination thatassist the kidneys and liver.Previous discussions have referred to the many consumer products that contain‘fragrance chemicals’ that can trigger a variety of respiratory problems.Laundry softeners, for example, contain a number of highly toxic and volatilechemical compounds, as explained by Drs Brian and Anna Clement in KillerClothes,> “These chemicals include toxins like chloroform, benzyl acetate, pentane, and> compounds that release formaldehyde.”Fabric softeners also contain ‘fragrance ingredients’, which, in combinationwith the softening chemicals, will exacerbate the exposure to irritants. Thevolatile nature of many of these chemicals means that they ‘off-gas’, whichenables them to be inhaled and drawn into the respiratory system where theycause damage and precipitate inflammation, which can cause the narrowing of theairways associated with asthma.Another of the key contributory factors for respiratory problems, includingasthma, is ‘air pollution’, which, according to the May 2018 WHO fact sheetentitled Ambient (outdoor) air quality and health,> “…is a major environmental risk to health.”The WHO Asthma fact sheet acknowledges that,> “Urbanization has been associated with an increase in asthma.”But adds the qualifying statement that,> “…the exact nature of this relationship is unclear.”This is a further indication of the refusal of the medical establishment torecognise the detrimental health effects due to widespread environmentalpollution, much of which emanates from industry and from the detrimental livingconditions in some urban areas. Although ‘outdoor air’ is polluted by factorssuch as vehicle exhaust and industrial emissions, amongst others, ‘indoor air’can also be polluted by a variety of factors. The EPA website providesinformation on various pages under the general heading Indoor Air Quality, oneof which is entitled Volatile Organic Compounds’ Impact on Indoor Air Qualityand refers to a number of organic chemicals that are widely used in householdproducts. The page states that,> “Paints, varnishes and wax all contain organic solvents, as do many cleaning,> disinfecting, cosmetic, degreasing and hobby products.”The toxic nature of solvents has been discussed, but it is pertinent toreiterate that they include some highly toxic chemicals, which include benzene,perchloroethylene and methylene chloride. Many of these substances are alsovolatile; they can therefore be inhaled and cause damage to the respiratorysystem. Methanol is another chemical of concern for asthmatics, mainly becauseit always metabolises into formaldehyde, which, according to the EPA page is,> “…one of the best known VOCs…”Formaldehyde is categorised as a group 1 carcinogen, but it is also known toproduce other adverse health effects, some of which involve the respiratorysystem, as the authors of Killer Clothes explain,> “Even at fairly low concentrations, formaldehyde can produce rapid onset of> nose and throat irritation...”If the exposure is of a short duration, the irritation, which may presentsymptoms similar to those of ‘hay fever’ or other ‘allergies’, may also be of asimilarly short duration. Exposures of a longer duration will inevitably inducesymptoms of a much more severe nature, as they further explain,> “At higher levels of exposure, it can cause significant inflammation of the> lower respiratory tract, which may result in swelling of the throat...”These symptoms bear a close resemblance to those included in the definition ofasthma and they clearly implicate toxic volatile chemicals, such asformaldehyde, as some of the causes of respiratory problems and asthma. Itshould be noted that swelling of the throat is also a typical symptom associatedwith anaphylaxis; which therefore implicates exposure to toxic chemicals as themajor, if not the sole, cause of this severe reaction.The group of respiratory diseases claimed to be responsible for the thirdlargest number of deaths includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, whichis said to be more serious and the cause of more deaths than asthma.Interestingly, the December 2017 WHO fact sheet entitled Chronic obstructivepulmonary disease (COPD) claims that,> “Some cases of COPD are due to long-term asthma.”It is clear from this statement that the WHO considers these respiratoryproblems to be related, especially as COPD is claimed to involve a reduction ofairflow. The fact sheet also claims that both indoor and outdoor pollution aremajor factors for COPD, although it is claimed that smoking is the maincontributory factor.COPD and asthma are both considered to be incurable but ‘manageable’ withtreatment; the fact sheet about asthma claims that,> “...failure to use appropriate medications or to adhere to treatment can lead> to death.”A further similarity between asthma and eczema is that ‘treatment’ involvesanti-inflammatory drugs, although people who suffer from asthma are also advisedto avoid the offending substances that ‘trigger’ an asthma attack. One drug usedin the treatment of asthma is a synthetic glucocorticoid, which is described asa ‘derivative of cortisol’, a natural hormone. But, as previously discussed,synthetic hormone derivatives are not the same as the natural hormones producedby the body. Another asthma treatment involves drugs that are administeredthrough an inhaler; as the fact sheet states,> “Medications such as inhaled corticosteroids are needed to control the> progression of severe asthma and reduce asthma exacerbation and deaths.”In common with all pharmaceuticals, these drugs are associated with many ‘sideeffects’, which can include: tremors, headache, muscle cramps and palpitations.However, the UK NHS website comments on these symptoms and states that,> “These side effects aren’t dangerous and should pass within a few minutes.”Whilst the side effects may not be dangerous, they are a clear indication thatthe substance referred to as ‘medicine’ is harmful. These ‘reactions’ alsoindicate that the body has reacted appropriately to a substance that it hascorrectly recognised as toxic.Although the symptoms of asthma mainly occur within the respiratory system, thisshould not be interpreted to mean that the underlying problem resides solelywithin that system; as indicated by Herbert Shelton, who states that,> “When there is irritation of the nose, throat, sinuses, and elsewhere, this> represents a systemic condition...”This reference to a systemic condition demonstrates that other health problemswill also be present in other organs and systems of the body; this explains theconcurrence of eczema, asthma and other ‘allergies’. Dr Bieler indicates some ofthe other organs associated with health problems in the respiratory system inFood is Your Best Medicine, in which he refers to asthma as a catarrhalbronchitis. He also discusses the presence of an underlying toxic build-up thatinitiates an inflammatory response. In most instances, the underlying toxicityaffects the endocrine system and the adrenal glands in particular; as he states,> “The adrenal activity in asthma patients is much below normal...”Furthermore, Dr Bieler counters the establishment claim that asthma is incurablewith the statement that,> “...I have found that a rational and often successful treatment depends first> upon detoxicating the patient.”The success of his detoxification treatments is a demonstration that asthma isdue to an underlying toxicity. Although this undermines the medicalestablishment claim that asthma is not ‘curable’, it must be noted thatdetoxification is only one of the factors that will contribute to improvedhealth; as the discussions in chapter ten will demonstrate.ArthritisThe general condition known as ‘arthritis’ is defined by the establishment as,> “inflammation of one or more joints characterized by pain, swelling, warmth,> redness of the overlying skin, and diminished range of joint motion.”It is claimed that there are many conditions that affect the joints, spine andlimbs; as indicated by the WHO web page entitled Chronic rheumatic conditions,which states that,> “Rheumatic or musculoskeletal conditions comprise over 150 diseases and> syndromes, which are usually progressive and associated with pain.”There are, however, two forms of arthritis that are claimed to be the mostcommon and to have the greatest impact on morbidity and disability; theseconditions are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).The establishment definition of osteoarthritis describes it as,> “a degenerative disease of joints resulting from wear of the articular> cartilage…”The WHO page claims that osteoarthritis is associated with ageing and that it,> “...will most likely affect the joints that have been continually stressed> throughout the years...”Although osteoarthritis is claimed to mainly affect older people, it is not aninevitable consequence of ageing; there are many people of an advanced age whodo not suffer from this condition. The reference to long-term ‘stress’ on jointsindicates one of the relevant factors that contribute to the occurrence of thiscondition in people who are not ‘old’. It is reliably reported that many formerathletes and dancers are affected by this condition; however, even then it isnot inevitable; the role of ‘physical activity’ and its relationship to healthis discussed in further detail in chapter ten.In common with many NCDs, the incidence of osteoarthritis is reported to haveincreased to the extent that, according to the WHO,> “Osteoarthritis is already one of the ten most disabling diseases in developed> countries.”"},{"pageContent":"The other major type of arthritis is called rheumatoid arthritis, which isdefined by the establishment as,> “…a disease of the synovial lining of the joints…”Unlike osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis is considered to be an autoimmunedisease, as indicated by the CDC web page entitled Rheumatoid arthritis thatdescribes it as,> “...an autoimmune and inflammatory disease, which means that your immune> system attacks healthy cells in your body by mistake, causing inflammation> (painful swelling) in the affected parts of the body.”The idea that the body makes a ‘mistake’ and attacks its own healthy cells andtissues has been discussed and shown to be unfounded. However, despite the CDC’sassertion that this is the case, the web page also makes the familiar admissionthat,> “The specific causes of RA are unknown…”The lack of knowledge about ‘specific causes’ is not limited to RA; the CDC webpages entitled Arthritis Basics include one labelled FAQs, which, in response tothe question about the causes of arthritis, makes the astounding admission that,> “Experts don’t know the cause of many forms of arthritis.”Despite this lack of knowledge, the CDC web pages about rheumatoid arthritisclaim that there are many ‘risk factors’ that trigger this condition. Some ofthese factors are referred to as ‘non-modifiable’, a list of which includes‘genetic’ factors. The second group of risk factors are referred to as‘modifiable’ and this list includes ‘infections’, about which the CDC web pageentitled Risk Factors states,> “Many microbial agents, like bacteria and viruses, can infect joints and> potentially cause the development of some types of arthritis.”This hypothesis has not, however, been proven, even by the medicalestablishment; as demonstrated by the NHS web page entitled Rheumatoidarthritis, which refers to theories that suggest infections or viruses mayprecipitate RA but admits that,> “… none of these theories have been proven.”The idea that arthritis mainly affects older adults is further refuted by thefact that it can also affect young people and even children. Although thiscondition is referred to generically as ‘juvenile arthritis’, the ArthritisFoundation web page entitled Juvenile Arthritis states that,> “Juvenile arthritis (JA) is not a disease in itself.”According to the page,> “JA is an umbrella term used to describe the many autoimmune and inflammatory> conditions or pediatric rheumatic diseases that can develop in children under> the age of 16.”The most common form of JA is called ‘juvenile idiopathic arthritis’; whichmeans that the cause is unknown. The web page also makes the increasinglyfamiliar statement that,> “No known cause has been pinpointed for most forms of juvenile arthritis…”However, this sentence continues with the claim that,> “…nor is there evidence to suggest that toxins, foods or allergies cause> children to develop JA.”This statement is disingenuous; the failure of the scientific community to fullyinvestigate and test the effects of chemicals, including food additives, meansthat the absence of evidence does not mean that these factors are not relevantto the onset of health problems, including inflammatory conditions diagnosed asarthritis.It is clear that many features of the conditions referred to under the umbrellaterm ‘arthritis’ remain unknown to the medical establishment; nevertheless,despite this paucity of knowledge, it is claimed that they are incurable andtherefore lifelong. The consequence is that, as with all other NCDs, the medicalestablishment only provides ‘treatments’, most of which invariably involvepharmaceutical drugs. The Arthritis Foundation web page entitled Drug Typesrefers to five main types of drugs, which are: analgesics; biologics;corticosteroids; DMARDs (disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs) and NSAIDs(non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). Analgesics are pain relievers such asparacetamol (acetaminophen); these over-the-counter drugs have been discussed.Other forms of analgesics are ‘opioids’, which are prescription-only drugs asthey are more potent; opioids are not only associated with various ‘sideeffects’, they have been shown to be addictive.Biologics are described on the web page as,> “…medications genetically engineered from a living organism, such as a virus,> gene or protein, to stimulate the body’s natural response to infection and> disease.”It should be noted that viruses, genes and proteins are not ‘living organisms’.The appropriateness of genetic engineering techniques for the production of‘medicines’ is highly questionable; especially in view of the lack of certaintyand predictability of these techniques, as demonstrated by the discussion aboutGE foods in chapter six.DMARDs and NSAIDs are anti-inflammatory drugs; the latter are alsopain-relievers. One type of DMARD is methotrexate, which is commonly used totreat adult rheumatoid arthritis and JIA, both of which are considered to beautoimmune conditions. As previously discussed, methotrexate is associated withunpleasant ‘side effects’; the web page entitled DMARDs: Side Effects andSolutions states that,> “The most common side effect with DMARDs is stomach upset, especially with> methotrexate.”Other ‘side effects’ referred to on this page include hair loss, fatigue andliver damage; the last of which provides the clearest demonstration of thetoxicity of these drugs.NSAIDs are claimed to suppress inflammation by blocking prostaglandins that inturn inhibit two enzymes known as cyclooxygenase (COX); these are referred to asCOX-1 and COX-2. NSAIDs are also associated with adverse ‘side effects’,including headaches, nausea and dizziness. However, some have also been linkedto far more serious effects. One type of COX-2 inhibitor drug, called Vioxx, wasdiscovered to produce an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes, afterwhich it was withdrawn from the market.The occurrence of pain and inflammation in an ‘older person’ may lead to adiagnosis of ‘arthritis’; however, many people over the age of 60 or even 50 maytake a number of ‘medicines’ as preventives for raised blood pressure orcholesterol, for example. It is highly unlikely that these people will be awareof the possibility that their current ‘medications’ are the cause of their newsymptoms. Dr Carolyn Dean refers to this problem in Death by Modern Medicine andstates that,> “Many people who take statins don’t know that their new aches and pains and> arthritic symptoms are due to statins.”The medical establishment claims that arthritis is not only incurable, but itcannot be prevented; as indicated by the web page entitled How to PreventArthritis that states,> “Right now, because scientists don’t fully understand the causes or mechanisms> behind these diseases, true prevention seems to be impossible.”Although scientists within the mainstream medical research community do notfully understand this condition, there are physicians who have investigated theproblem and have established that toxicity is a major factor. One of theseknowledgeable physicians is Dr Henry Bieler, who refers to arthritis as theresult of toxic overload and calls it a,> “...vicarious elimination through the middle skin.”The ‘middle skin’ refers to the middle layer of the skin.Contrary to the claim made by the Arthritis Foundation, Dr Bieler considers thatboth toxins and a poor diet are relevant factors for the onset of pain andinflammation that may be diagnosed as one of the many forms of arthritis.There are many factors that could generate inflammation around the joints; theprevious discussions have indicated that damage to the tissues initiatesinflammation, which is a ‘remedial action’, the purpose of which is explained byHerbert Shelton who states,> “Inflammation is simply a great increase in the amount of blood in a> circumscribed area of the body.”He also explains that the increase in the blood supply will produce certainsymptoms,> “The pain, the redness, the swelling, the heat and the impairment of function> are all due to the local excess of blood.”These symptoms bear a close resemblance to those referred to in the definitionof ‘arthritis’. Inflammation is, as discussed, only problematic if theunderlying ‘toxaemia’ is not addressed; but these health problems cannot besolved by pharmaceutical drugs, which contain synthetic chemicals that are toxicto the human body and therefore increase the body burden of ‘poisons’.Endocrine Diseases and DisordersThe establishment definition refers to an endocrine gland as ‘ductless’ anddefines it as,> “a gland that manufactures one or more hormones and secretes them directly> into the bloodstream...”The page entitled Overview on the website of The Endocrine Disruption Exchange(TEDX) describes the endocrine system in more detail,> “The endocrine system is the body’s exquisitely balanced system of glands,> organs, and hormones that regulates such vital functions as body growth,> response to stress, sexual development, production of insulin and utilization> of glucose, metabolism, neurodevelopment, intelligence, behaviour, sleep> patterns, blood pressure, and the ability to reproduce.”Hormones are ‘biochemical messengers’, each type of which produces specific‘messages’ that are relevant to specific organs, as Dr Hans Selye explains inThe Stress of Life,> “...each hormone carries instructions in a code which only certain organs can> read.”The field of endocrinology is reported to have begun during the 19th centurywhen anatomical investigations first revealed the existence of ductless glands,which were discovered to secrete ‘messenger chemicals’. However, it was notuntil the early 20th century that the first of these chemicals was isolated byDr E H Starling, who is credited not only with the discovery of secretin, butalso with the creation of the term ‘hormone’ to refer to these chemicals.Further research in the field of endocrinology revealed that certain healthproblems were related to an ‘incorrect’ level of hormones, whether too high ortoo low. These health problems have been labelled ‘endocrine disorders’, asindicated by the NIDDK (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and KidneyDiseases) web page entitled Endocrine Diseases that states,> “If your hormone levels are too high or too low, you may have an endocrine> disease or disorder.”There are many different conditions referred to as endocrine diseases ordisorders that are said to result from an under- or over-production of aparticular hormone. The conditions of this nature listed on the NIDDK pageinclude acromegaly, Cushing’s syndrome, Graves’ Disease, Cystic Fibrosis andAddison’s Disease.In common with all other health problems, the medical establishment considersthat pharmaceuticals are the only method by which ‘endocrine diseases’ should beaddressed. They therefore employ pharmaceutical drugs that are claimed to beable to correct a hormone imbalance by delivering extra hormones if the level istoo low, or by inhibiting their production if the level is too high. There are,however, many problems with this approach, not least of which is thatpharmaceutical hormones have been shown to differ from hormones naturallyproduced by the body, despite the assertion that they have the same chemicalstructure.Cortisol is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands when the body is understress; high levels of stress generate high levels of cortisol, but these levelsreturn to normal when the body ceases to be under stress; the topic of stress isdiscussed in more detail in chapter ten. Cushing’s syndrome, which is said to becaused by an excess level of cortisol is, however, reported to mainly resultfrom the long-term use of pharmaceutical corticosteroids, as recognised by theNIDDK page about this condition that states,> “Many people develop Cushing’s syndrome because they take glucocorticoids –> steroid hormones that are chemically similar to naturally produced cortisol –> such as prednisone for asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and other> inflammatory diseases.”The cortisol in pharmaceutical drugs may be ‘chemically similar’ but it is notidentical to the natural cortisol produced by the adrenal glands.The level of each hormone naturally fluctuates according to the body’srequirements; this is demonstrated by the ‘exquisite balance’ of the endocrinesystem that carefully regulates and controls the production and release ofhormones.Pharmaceuticals, by contrast, do not participate in the regulation of allhormones; instead they interfere with and disrupt the endocrine system, which,as the TEDX page states, regulates many of the body’s vital functions. Inaddition, pharmaceutical drugs always contain other ingredients, preservativesfor example, none of which are ‘natural’ components of the human body; whichmeans that they interfere with normal functioning, rather than assist it. As hasbeen discussed, all pharmaceutical-based treatments are acknowledged to beassociated with ‘side effects’; synthetic hormone treatments are clearly noexception. The ‘side effects’ of hydrocortisone, a corticosteroid drug, includenausea, headaches and dizziness.There are many aspects of the endocrine system that are poorly understood by themedical establishment, as indicated by the widespread use of steroid-basedtreatments for conditions that involve inflammation. One particularcharacteristic of the endocrine system that is inadequately recognised is thathormones exist in the body in extremely tiny concentrations. Dr Theo Colborndescribes this characteristic with reference to the womb environment in heressay entitled Peace that states,> “The endocrine system is so fine-tuned that it depends upon hormones in> concentrations as little as a tenth of a trillionth of a gram to control the> womb environment, as inconspicuous as one second in 3,169 centuries.”The existence of hormones in incredibly minute concentrations is not restrictedto the womb environment. It is clear, therefore, that any influence thatdisrupts the ‘exquisite balance’ of the endocrine system can have seriousconsequences. Furthermore, hormones do not function in isolation, many of themrely on the production and release of other hormones in the body. Yet,pharmaceutical drugs are intended to only deliver or affect a single hormone,which means that they further disrupt the endocrine system, its balance, and thefunctions it regulates.In common with many other chronic health problems, endocrine disorders areincreasing in incidence. Unfortunately, the medical establishment possesses apoor level of knowledge about the diseases associated with the endocrine system.The discussion about diabetes demonstrated that, despite the fact that insulinwas one of the first hormones to be discovered, this condition remains poorlyunderstood, as indicated by a 2002 article entitled The endocrine system indiabetes mellitus that states,> “The pathophysiology of diabetes mellitus is complex and not fully> understood.”Pathophysiology refers to the functional changes that occur during disease.Another problematic hormone treatment is HRT (hormone replacement therapy),which is claimed to relieve the symptoms experienced during the ‘menopause’; asexplained by Dr Carolyn Dean in Death by Modern Medicine,> “Labeling menopause a disease due to estrogen deficiency, doctors attempted to> ‘cure’ the condition by introducing estrogen replacement.”Inevitably, as with all pharmaceuticals, HRT is associated with ‘side effects’,which, according to the NHS web page entitled Hormone replacement therapy (HRT),include nausea, leg cramps, bloating, headaches and indigestion, amongst others.It is clear that the use of HRT merely exchanges one set of symptoms foranother. Dr Dean also discusses the Women’s Health Initiative study that wasintended to demonstrate the efficacy of one type of HRT drug; but, as sheexplains,> “...the study found an increased incidence of heart attack, stroke and breast> cancer in women.”She also reports that the study revealed an increased risk of dementiaassociated with the use of this particular HRT drug.Another clear but poignant example of the effects of disruption to the endocrinesystem is the pharmaceutical drug thalidomide, which was the cause of a varietyof birth defects in approximately 8,000 children in 46 different countries. Oneof the countries in which birth defects did not occur was the US because DrFrances Kelsey PhD MD, the FDA officer responsible for approving thalidomide,had had reservations about the drug and had decided to withhold FDA approvalpending further studies. The reports from other countries about the devastatingeffects caused by this drug vindicated her decision. Thalidomide was originallyprescribed as a general treatment for nausea, but was subsequently extended totreat pregnant women who suffered from morning sickness. In their book OurStolen Future, authors Dr Theo Colborn, Dianne Dumanoski and Dr John P Myers PhDdiscuss the different abnormalities experienced by babies born to mothers whohad taken thalidomide during their pregnancy,> “Some babies were born with hands sprouting directly from their shoulders and> no arms at all. Others lacked legs or were no more than a totally limbless> trunk.”It is particularly significant that, in addition to the variations in the typeof limb deformities that occurred, there were many cases in which differentorgans had been affected; some babies suffered defects in their heart or otherorgans. It is also significant that some babies remained unaffected. It isexplained in Our Stolen Future that these differences bore no relation to the‘dose’ of thalidomide that the mothers had taken; the effects were shown to beclosely related to the stage of foetal development when the drug was taken. Evena single dose of this drug at a particularly crucial stage in foetal developmenthad been shown to have a major effect on the growth of a limb or organ.A similar tragedy with less conspicuous, but equally devastating consequences,involved the drug called DES (diethylstilbestrol), which, in this case, had beenapproved for use in the US. It was believed that DES had an ‘oestrogenic’effect, which was claimed to be beneficial for certain problems associated withpregnancy. In Our Stolen Future it is explained that DES was prescribed,> “...to women experiencing problems during pregnancy in the belief that> insufficient estrogen levels caused miscarriages and premature births.”Prescriptions for DES were not restricted to pregnant women; as the book alsoexplains,> “Doctors used it liberally to suppress milk production after birth, to> alleviate hot flashes and other menopausal symptoms, and to treat acne,> prostate cancer, gonorrhoea in children...”Like thalidomide, the consequences of DES taken by the mother during pregnancywere visited on both male and female babies; but, unlike thalidomide, theconsequences of DES were not discovered at birth. The adverse effects, whichoften manifested within the reproductive system, were frequently revealed whenthe affected babies had become adults and wanted to have a family of their own;the effects of DES had sadly made this impossible. It was also discovered thatthere was an increased incidence of cancer in the children of mothers who hadtaken DES; although these cancers would also appear later in life. It becameclear that, as with thalidomide, it had been the timing rather than the dose ofDES that had been the most significant factor.It should be noted that, despite the adverse health effects with which they areassociated, both thalidomide and DES remain in use as treatments for certaincancers; DES, for example, is used as a treatment for prostate cancer.The examples cited above, although well-known, are not the only pharmaceuticaldrugs that have been demonstrated to cause serious adverse effects in theendocrine system. Furthermore, pharmaceutical drugs are by no means the onlysubstances that can produce such adverse effects, many chemicals have also beenfound to affect the endocrine system; these are known as ‘endocrine disruptingchemicals’, or EDCs.As has been asserted throughout this book, the vast majority of chemicals havenot been tested to determine the full extent of their effects on the human body;however, until relatively recently, none of them had been tested to determinetheir effects on the endocrine system.Observations of certain problems within wildlife populations, especiallydwindling bird population numbers, were famously brought to the attention of thepublic by the publication in 1962 of Silent Spring. which eventually led to thewithdrawal of DDT from use in many, but not all, countries. Although regarded asa ‘victory’, it was an extremely limited one; DDT was by no means the only toxicchemical in widespread use. Furthermore, the DDT ban was not accompanied byefforts to test the safety of all chemicals in use; nor was it accompanied bythe introduction of procedures to test the effects of chemicals on the endocrinesystem.Prior to the publication of Silent Spring, there was some awareness thatchemicals could produce adverse effects on the endocrine system, but this hadclearly failed to influence chemical testing procedures. Some progress inexpanding the awareness of the problem was made in July 1991, when a meeting ofscientists from a variety of fields, including biology, toxicology andendocrinology, was held in a place called Wingspread in the US. One of theparticipants was Dr Theo Colborn, who subsequently dedicated herself to studyingendocrine disrupting chemicals, and exposing the dangers they pose to a wideaudience of policy makers and government officials as well as the public. Theseefforts included the creation in 2003 of the TEDX website, which contains awealth of information about the adverse effects of EDCs, including scientificresearch papers on the topic. After Dr Colborn’s death in December 2014, thewebsite continued to be updated by TEDX scientists; but these updates ceased inNovember 2019.The documents available on the TEDX website include a paper about the Wingspreadmeeting that declares one of the purposes of this meeting to have been,> “…to establish a research agenda that would clarify uncertainties remaining in> the field.”The paper, which is a statement from one of the work sessions at the Wingspreadmeeting, is entitled Chemically-induced alterations in sexual development: Thewildlife/human connection; it expresses the problem under investigation in thefollowing terms,> “Many compounds introduced into the environment by human activity are capable> of disrupting the endocrine system of animals, including fish, wildlife and> humans.”The endocrine system has been demonstrated to exhibit similarities across a widerange of animal species, if not all of them. It is for this reason that allendocrine disrupting effects demonstrated by animal research studies aredirectly relevant to human health. This does not mean that animalexperimentation is justifiable; it does, however, demonstrate that EDCs canadversely affect all living organisms in a very similar way.The participants of the Wingspread session stated in the paper that they hadreached a consensus on certain issues, one of which was that the chemicalsimplicated in the disruption of the endocrine system included,> “…the persistent, bioaccumulative, organohalogen compounds that include some> pesticides (fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides) and industrial> chemicals, other synthetic products, and some metals.”The footnote to this paragraph refers to many substances that were known at thattime to be endocrine disruptors; those listed in the footnote include: DDT; TCDDand other dioxins; lead; mercury; synthetic pyrethroids; TCDF and other furans.The fields of toxicology and chemistry both adhere to the notion that it is thedose that makes a substance a poison and that there is therefore a ‘safe’ doseof all substances, no matter how toxic. It should be clear that the tinyconcentrations in which hormones circulate throughout the body means thatnowhere is it more imperative that this dangerous myth be destroyed than in thecontext of the endocrine system, which regulates so many vital functions,including the ability to reproduce.Dr Colborn and her colleagues expose the ‘dose’ myth in a 2012 paper entitledHormones and Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals: Low-Dose Effects and NonmonotonicDose Responses, which states that,> “For decades, studies of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) have challenged> traditional concepts in toxicology, in particular the dogma of ‘the dose makes> the poison’, because EDCs can have effects at low doses that are not predicted> by effects at higher doses.”The mainstream scientific approach to testing the effects of chemicals hasfollowed the idea that increased doses produced increased effects; this linearassociation is referred to as the ‘monotonic dose-response’ relationship.However, many chemicals display a non-linear, ‘non-monotonic dose-response’relationship; which means that doses at levels lower than those deemed to be‘safe’ under traditional toxicology, can produce far greater effects, especiallywithin the endocrine system, as indicated by the 2012 paper cited above.One of the greatest consequences from adherence to the ‘dose’ myth has been thedevastating effects of EDCs on the developing baby, the most vulnerable memberof the human population. This problem is eloquently expressed by Dr Colborn inher 2000 Peace article that states,> “In our ignorance we assumed that the womb was inviolable while at the same> time we produced more and more synthetic chemicals to improve the quality of> our lives.”The resources available on the TEDX website include video presentations, one ofwhich is entitled Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals: Science, Policy, and What YouCan Do. This video is presented by Dr Carol Kwiatkowski PhD, Executive Directorof TEDX, who explains that one of the main problems associated with EDCs isthat,> “There are hundreds of thousands of chemicals in existence, most of which have> never been tested for endocrine disruption.”The failure to incorporate procedures to test the effects of chemicals on theendocrine system has resulted in their continued production and use in manycommon household products; the consequences of this are explained on theOverview page on the TEDX website, that states,> “Endocrine disruptors have been found in every person tested, across world> populations.”The TEDX team had compiled a list of the EDCs that had been identified bySeptember 2018; this list is available on the web page entitled TEDX List ofPotential Endocrine Disruptors. Another web page, entitled About the TEDX List,states that this list,> “…identifies chemicals that have shown evidence of endocrine disruption in> scientific research.”The first list, compiled in 2011, contained 881 chemicals; by September 2018 thenumber had increased to 1,484.This is clearly a very small fraction of the hundreds of thousands of chemicalsin existence; however, it would be a mistake to assume that these are the onlychemicals capable of causing endocrine disruption. These 1,484 substances arethe only chemicals that have so far been tested and proven to disrupt theendocrine system; as Dr Kwiatkowski has stated, most chemicals are untested fortheir endocrine effects. The chemicals that have been discovered to affect theendocrine system are associated with many adverse health effects, as explainedon the TEDX Overview page,> “Endocrine disrupting chemicals have been implicated in numerous adverse> health outcomes, including those of the endocrine, reproductive, neurological> and metabolic systems.”These adverse health outcomes are clearly related to the many ‘endocrinediseases and disorders’ described by the NIDDK, NHS and other mainstream healthorganisations. However, in her TEDX video, Dr Kwiatkowski refers to theincreased incidence of other health problems that are not endocrine diseases assuch, but are linked to a poorly functioning endocrine system. The healthproblems referred to include autoimmune disorders, autism, asthma, diabetes,thyroid disorders, ADHD and some forms of cancer. In addition, Dr Kwiatkowskimakes the extremely important comment that,> “Genetic inheritance cannot explain the relatively recent and dramatic> increases in many disorders which have been shown to be endocrine related.”The salient point is that the rise in endocrine-related health problemscorresponds closely with the 20th century expansion of ‘industrialisation’, andthe accompanying increased production and use of synthetic chemicals,predominantly those based on petrochemicals derived from coal, natural gas andoil; this supports the description by Dr Theron Randolph of modern chronichealth conditions as ‘the petroleum problem’.The TEDX page entitled Oil & Gas Program refers to oil and gas as ‘fossilfuels’, a mistaken label for reasons that are discussed in chapter nine.Nevertheless, it is recognised by TEDX that many of the chemicals involved inoil and gas extraction, especially hydraulic fracturing operations, areendocrine disruptors. The discussion in chapter six about fracking indicates thehighly toxic nature of many of the chemicals discovered by Dr Colborn and herteam to have been used in those operations.The endocrine system can also be disrupted by harmful influences other thantoxic chemicals; these influences include electromagnetic radiation. Thediscussion about EHS referred to evidence that EMFs can disrupt the productionof melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, which is an organ of theendocrine system. The effects of EMFs on melatonin production are discussed byDr Robert Becker in The Body Electric, in which he refers to a 1980 rat studythat,> “...found that a weak 60-hertz electric field (only 3.9 volts per centimetre)> cancelled the normal nightly rise in production of the pineal gland hormone> melatonin, the main hormone mediatory of biocycles.”The similarities in the endocrine systems of all animals means that this studyresult is directly applicable to humans. Dr Becker also refers in his book tothe findings of Russian studies conducted in the 1970s which showed that,> “...radio and microwave frequencies, at power densities well below the> American safety guideline of 10,000 microwatts, stimulate the thyroid gland> and thus increase the basal metabolic rate.”It was previously demonstrated that an increased metabolic rate is associatedwith an increased generation of free radicals and oxidative stress, which isassociated with an increasing variety of health problems.It is clear that all disrupting influences, whether chemical or electromagneticin nature, are able to override the ability of the endocrine system to retaincontrol over all of the body’s vital functions it regulates. These disruptinginfluences inevitably interfere with the body’s ability to restore and maintainhomeostasis, which is discussed in more detail in chapter ten.Although some effects of endocrine disruption can be alleviated and evenreversed, others cannot be. The examples of DES and thalidomide indicate theextent of the damaging effects that can occur during pregnancy, especially fromexposures at a critical stage of development, and can result in permanent ‘birthdefects’, as discussed in the next section.Birth DefectsThe 2007 Oxford Concise Medical Dictionary does not define ‘birth defect’, butit does define the term ‘congenital’, which is described as a condition thatexists at birth; the definition also refers to ‘congenital malformations’, aboutwhich it states,> “Congenital malformations include all disorders present at birth whether they> are inherited or caused by an environmental factor.”The September 2016 WHO fact sheet entitled Congenital anomalies, states that,> “Congenital anomalies are also known as birth defects, congenital disorders or> congenital malformations.”This statement indicates that these terms are used interchangeably, theestablishment definition of a ‘congenital malformation’ therefore applies to allof them.Birth defects are clearly a distressing topic, but they need to be discussedbecause there are reasons that they occur, although these reasons are poorlyacknowledged by the medical establishment. The fact sheet claims that,> “Although approximately 50% of all congenital anomalies cannot be linked to a> specific cause, there are some known genetic, environmental and other causes> or risk factors.”It is claimed that the other causes and risk factors include certain maternal‘infections’ such as rubella and syphilis. Infection with the ‘Zika’ virus hasalso been implicated in causing a certain type of birth defect called‘microcephaly’; this will be discussed in more detail later in this section. Itshould be clear however, that no ‘infection’ can cause a birth defect.It is disturbing that congenital anomalies are a significant and increasingcause of infant deaths within the first month of life; a stage referred to as‘neonatal’. According to the April 2015 version of the WHO Congenital anomaliesfact sheet, the estimated worldwide number of neonatal deaths each year due tobirth defects was 276,000; the revised fact sheet updated in September 2016,however, states that,> “An estimated 303,000 newborns die within 4 weeks of birth every year,> worldwide, due to congenital anomalies.”Also disturbing is that the CDC web page entitled Facts about Birth Defectsrefers to birth defects as ‘common’ and usually caused by a mix of factors, butthat,> “…we don’t fully understand how these factors might work together to cause> birth defects.”The WHO fact sheet refers to the role of genetic factors and indicates that theyrepresent a significant contribution to birth defects in the claim that,> “Genes play an important role in many congenital anomalies.”This claim is misleading; birth defects have occurred in the absence of a familyhistory of such events; however, the significant increase in the incidence ofbirth defects in recent years refutes the idea that genetic factors play anyrole. This refutation is corroborated by Dr Kwiatkowski, whose comment in theTEDX video referred to in the previous discussion deserves repetition,> “Genetic inheritance cannot explain the relatively recent and dramatic> increases in many disorders which have been shown to be endocrine related.”Reproduction, growth and development are all regulated by the endocrine system;birth defects are therefore undeniably ‘endocrine-related’ conditions.Despite the misleading claim about the role of genes, the fact sheet also refersto environmental factors as relevant ‘risk factors’ for congenital anomalies,> “Maternal exposure to certain pesticides and other chemicals, as well as> certain medications, alcohol, tobacco and radiation during pregnancy, may> increase the risk of having a fetus or neonate affected by congenital> anomalies.”The reference to ‘certain’ substances would seem to suggest that it is only arelatively small number of pesticides, chemicals and medications that have arecognised association with birth defects. Whilst this may be factually correct,it is a misleading statement, because the full range of adverse effects on theendocrine system of the majority of chemicals remains untested and thereforeunknown.The previous discussion referred to some of the ‘medications’ that have givenrise to birth defects, and to the many different organs and systems in thedeveloping baby that can be affected by toxic pharmaceuticals taken by themother when pregnant. It was also shown that it is the timing of the maternalexposure to an endocrine-disrupting ‘medication’ that is the main influence overthe extent and nature of the effects produced on the developing baby.In addition to pharmaceuticals, there are many chemicals that have beenidentified as having the ability to disrupt the endocrine system; which meansthat maternal exposure to these EDCs can cause significant harm to thedeveloping baby, as indicated by Dr Colborn in her Peace essay,> “Unfortunately, when development is violated in the womb by man-made> chemicals, the newborn is compromised.”These chemicals are, however, truly ubiquitous, as Dr Colborn states,> “No child born today is free of man-made chemicals.”All substances that are capable of adversely affecting the development of afoetus are called teratogens, the establishment definition of which is,> “any substance, agent, or process that induces the formation of developmental> abnormalities in a fetus.”The failure of safety testing procedures to investigate the effects of allchemicals, including pharmaceuticals, on the endocrine system means that only asmall percentage of substances have been recognised to be teratogenic. This isparticularly significant in respect of drugs used for the treatment of certainconditions, even during pregnancy, as revealed by a 2010 article entitledTeratogenic mechanisms of medical drugs which, under the heading Background,states,> “Although prescription drug use is common during pregnancy, the human> teratogenic risks are undetermined for more than 90% of drug treatments> approved in the USA during the past decades.”The reason that the teratogenic effects of most drugs is ‘undetermined’ isbecause it is regarded as unethical to conduct drug trials on pregnant women.Yet drugs that have not been tested for human teratogenicity are neverthelessprescribed for use by pregnant women, who are therefore unwitting test subjects.The similarity of the endocrine systems of all animals means that teratogeniceffects observed during animal research studies should be recognised as a cleardemonstration that the drug, or chemical, will be a definite human teratogen.Certain conditions, epilepsy for example, are claimed to require thecontinuation of ‘medication’, even during pregnancy, in order to manage thesymptoms. Other ‘diseases’ are also claimed to require the continuation of‘medication’ in order to prevent the disease being transmitted to the developingbaby. Most conditions of this type are ‘infectious diseases’, such as ‘AIDS’,which has been discussed. It should be noted, however, that AZT, one of the maindrug treatments for ‘HIV/AIDS’, was originally formulated as a cancer drug, andthat virtually all cancer drugs and treatments are teratogenic.In addition to pharmaceutical drugs, many chemicals have been proven to beteratogenic; the family of phthalates, for example, which are used as coatingson certain drugs as well as in a wide variety of common consumer products. Theubiquitous nature of phthalates has been discussed; their teratogenicity addsanother serious concern about their inclusion in a wide variety of products thatmay be used by pregnant women. Chemicals that have been shown to be teratogenicinclude pesticides and other agricultural chemicals. A 2009 article entitledAgrichemicals in surface water and birth defects in the United States refers toa study that investigated an association between agrichemicals and birthdefects. The article reports that a ‘significant association’ was found by thestudy and states that this finding is not an isolated occurrence,> “There is a growing body of evidence that agrichemical exposures may> contribute to birth defects.”One of the many chemical compounds found to be teratogenic is TCDD, a member ofthe family of dioxins, which, as discussed, result from the processing oforganochlorines. The manufacture of Agent Orange, the organochlorine-baseddefoliant used in the Vietnam war, caused the final product to be ‘contaminated’with TCDD; it was not an intended ingredient. However, the ‘contamination’ ofAgent Orange by TCDD is claimed to have occurred only in ‘trace amounts’; theconcentration is said to occur in parts per billion, which is not considered tobe a significant level. As Dr Colborn has stated, hormones circulate in fartinier concentrations; often in only parts per trillion, which makes the ‘traceamounts’ of TCDD, or any other teratogen, at parts per billion, a matter ofsignificance and of serious concern.Organophosphate-based chemicals, such as cholinesterase-inhibiting pesticides,are also teratogenic. The discussion about Gulf War Syndrome indicated thatexposures to the combination of organophosphate pesticides and other toxicchemicals had seriously affected military personnel. In addition to the effectssuffered by the men and women who served in the military, there has been anincreased incidence of birth defects in children conceived after their returnfrom military conflicts in the Gulf and elsewhere. Exposure to organophosphatepesticides has been associated with an increase in a particular type of birthdefect, called neural tube defects, which are discussed in the section aboutspina bifida.Glyphosate, the pesticide commonly used with GM crops, has also been linked tobirth defects. The section about GE foods in chapter six referred to theArgentinian study conducted by Professor Carrasco that was reported by WilliamEngdahl in his October 2010 article entitled Study Shows Monsanto RoundupHerbicide Link to Birth Defects. The most significant statement in the articleis that,> “Roundup in far lower concentrations than used in agriculture is linked to> birth defects.”This demonstrates, yet again, that endocrine disruption occurs at levels thathave been deemed by traditional toxicology to be ‘safe’; but these chemicals areclearly unsafe.Methanol is another teratogenic chemical; this is demonstrated by Dr WoodrowMonte, who explains that, when purchased for laboratory use, methanol carries awarning label that refers to its potential to cause birth defects. As discussed,methanol has many uses; it is present in cigarettes due to the methods used toprocess tobacco leaves. In While Science Sleeps Dr Monte states that,> “Consequently, methanol is one of the most abundant poisons found in tobacco> smoke.”The fact that methanol is an ingredient of aspartame means that this toxic‘sweetener’ is also teratogenic; as indicated by Dr Carolyn Dean who quotes DrBetty Martini’s statement that,> “Aspartame is a teratogen causing birth defects and mental retardation.”The endocrine system also regulates growth and development after birth; whichmeans that any influence that can adversely affect the baby’s endocrine systemcan adversely affect ‘normal’ development after birth. The use of plastics madewith phthalate plasticisers for the manufacture of many baby’s toys can be acontributory factor to later ‘problems’ that may be labelled as ADD, ADHD orautism, for example. In the previous discussion, Dr Kwiatkowski referred tothese conditions as being ‘endocrine-related’; autism is discussed later in thischapter.One substance that has been mentioned many times is also appropriate to thisdiscussion, because mercury is also teratogenic. Its deadly nature is explainedby Dr Carolyn Dean in Death by Modern Medicine,> “Mercury is a neurotoxin, a carcinogen, a teratogen, a nephrotoxin and is life> threatening.”Many of the chemicals used as ingredients of cosmetics and personal careproducts are not only toxic, they are also teratogenic and, again, this ofteninvolves members of the family of phthalates. One chemical in this family,called DBP (dibutyl phthalate), is an ingredient of nail polish and implicatedin various reproductive problems; as Dr Epstein explains in Toxic Beauty,> “The highest levels were recorded in women twenty to forty years of age, the> prime childbearing years – a major cause for concern since DBP has been linked> to birth defects and reproductive problems.”Other influences that have been proven to be teratogenic include ionisingradiation, especially X-rays. In Secret Fallout, Dr Ernest Sternglass refers toa study by Dr ML Griem that investigated children whose mothers had been X-rayedwhilst pregnant. Dr Griem’s data showed that,> “...there was a significant increase in benign tumors and certain types of> congenital birth defects...”Although the expectant mother’s exposure to teratogens is a significantcontributory factor for birth defects, the father’s exposure cannot be ignored,as the example of the male Gulf War veterans has demonstrated. This point isalso of significance in the context of exposures to ionising radiation. In ThePlutonium Files, Eileen Welsome reports details of the nuclear bomb tests thatoccurred in the late 1940s. Although there were many unknown factors about ‘safelevels’ of radiation, she explains that, at the time, it was discovered that,> “...as little as 0.5 roentgens per day for three months or less could result> in defective children in successive generations.”She also refers to examples of military personnel who had worked in theManhattan Project, or were present during various nuclear bomb tests, or both.As a result of their duties, many of these men were exposed to radiation andsome of their children suffered defects of various kinds.In Secret Fallout, Dr Sternglass also refers to radiation emissions from theeveryday operations of nuclear power plants. He reports that, at a particularlocation near to a nuclear power plant, it was discovered that there was ahigher than ‘normal’ number of infant deaths in the vicinity; in addition towhich were some other disturbing discoveries,> “And for each infant dying in the first year of life, it was well known that> there were perhaps three to four that would live with serious genetic defects,> crippling congenital malformations, and mental retardation...”Non-ionising radiation, although considered to be less dangerous than ionisingradiation, is also capable of causing birth defects. The link between EMFs andbirth defects has been known for decades. In Cross Currents, Dr Robert Beckerrefers to Dr S Nordstrom, who conducted investigations in Sweden in 1983 todiscover the effects on men who worked in high-voltage electric switchyards, andwho found that,> “The exposure to the electric-power frequency fields (50 Hz in Europe)> produced abnormalities in chromosomes of the sperm of the switchyard workers,> which resulted in birth defects in their children.”One of the articles in the BioInitiative Report 2012, referred to in chaptersix, is entitled Electromagnetic Field Exposure Effects (ELF-EMF and RFR) onFertility and Reproduction. Although the article is mainly concerned withdecreased fertility in men as the result of exposure to EMFs, it also makes thepertinent statement that,> “Several studies, especially at power frequency 50/60 Hz magnetic field, have> found an association of exposure to human health, with emphasis on a range of> clinical conditions including childhood leukaemia, brain tumours, genotoxicity> and neurodegenerative disease, infertility, birth defects, increased risk of> miscarriage, childhood morbidity and de novo mutations.”These effects indicate that EMF exposures have wide-ranging detrimental effects,especially on many of the functions of the endocrine system.During 2015, reports began to emerge about the outbreak of a new birth defect‘problem’; an unusual cluster of cases of microcephaly had been observed inBrazil. Microcephaly is a ‘congenital’ condition in which the baby’s head orbrain, or both, has not fully developed prior to birth. According to the medicalestablishment, the cause of this outbreak had been discovered to be apreviously-known ‘virus’ called Zika.Microcephaly is clearly a serious problem, but the symptoms of a Zika‘infection’ were, prior to 2015, only associated with mild symptoms thatcommonly involved a fever, rash, joint pain, muscle pain and headache. However,despite the fact that the causes of most birth defects are unknown to themedical establishment, the idea was promoted that the Zika ‘virus’ was the causeof these cases of microcephaly. This is demonstrated by the CDC web pageentitled Facts about Microcephaly that states,> “CDC scientists announced that enough evidence has accumulated to conclude> that Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause of microcephaly and> other severe fetal brain defects.”It is clear that microcephaly cannot be caused by a virus, but can be caused bytoxic chemicals that are teratogenic. It was also reported at the time thatcertain regions of Brazil had been subjected to intense pesticide sprayingprogrammes, and that these regions included the same areas in which many casesof microcephaly had been discovered. Unfortunately, the medical establishmentbelief that the Zika virus is spread by mosquitoes has resulted in furtherpesticide spraying programmes in various countries around the world to ‘combat’the Zika problem. Clearly the increased and intensified use of pesticides willonly exacerbate the problem, not solve it.Although the information promulgated by the medical establishment is frequentlymisleading, it occasionally contains some useful advice; the CDC web entitledPlanning for pregnancy, for example, includes the recommendation to,> “Avoid toxic substances and other environment contaminants, harmful materials> at work or at home, such as synthetic chemicals, metals, fertilizer, bug> spray…”This is good advice, but, as in most instances of the advice offered by themedical establishment, it is woefully inadequate because, it fails to includereference to all of the substances that are teratogenic, including certainpharmaceutical ‘medicines’.Down’s SyndromeDown’s syndrome, also called Down syndrome, is defined by the establishment as,> “a condition resulting from a chromosomal abnormality most commonly due to the> presence of three copies of chromosome 21 (trisomy 21), which is most likely> to occur with advanced maternal age.”The claim that ‘advanced maternal age’ is a relevant factor for a Down’ssyndrome baby is misleading, because women of all ages have given birth tobabies with this condition; there is however, a reason for the increasedlikelihood that an older mother may give birth to a baby with Down’s syndrome,as this discussion will demonstrate.The nucleus of most cells contains 46 chromosomes arranged in 23 identicalpairs. During the normal course of life, millions of the body’s cells die everyday and need to be replaced. The replacement process involves a form of celldivision called ‘mitosis’ that entails the generation of two identical daughtercells, each of which contains 46 chromosomes arranged in 23 identical pairs.The exception to this process occurs in cells referred to as ‘germ cells’, alsocalled cells in the germ line. In this context, however, the word ‘germ’ doesnot refer to a pathogen. Instead, it refers to the primary stage of something.Germ cells are precursors of the reproductive cells of both sperm and ova andare therefore the primary cells from which the human body develops. These germcells undergo ‘meiosis’, a form of cell division that entails the generation offour daughter cells, each of which contains 23 unpaired chromosomes. Afterfurther processes take place, including fertilisation, these cells become thesex cells and are restored to the full complement of 46 chromosomes, butarranged in 22 identical pairs plus an additional pair that comprise therelevant sex chromosomes. Females have two X chromosomes; males have one Xchromosome plus one Y chromosome.Under certain circumstances, cell division of either type may result in thegeneration of an ‘abnormal’ number and arrangement of chromosomes in thedaughter cells; a situation that is known as aneuploidy. An extra chromosomethat creates a trio instead of a pair is called trisomy; a missing chromosomefrom a pair is called monosomy.According to the NDSS (National Down Syndrome Society) web page entitled DownSyndrome,> “There is no definitive scientific research that indicates that Down syndrome> is caused by environmental factors or the parents’ activities before or during> pregnancy.”This is erroneous; there is scientific research that has discovered reasons forchromosomal abnormalities to occur.Dr David Rasnick PhD and Dr Peter Duesberg have studied aneuploidy and its rolein health problems, especially cancer, which is discussed later in this chapter.In his article entitled The aneuploidy theory of cancer and the barriers to itsacceptance, Dr Rasnick refers to the existence of aneuploidy in Down’s syndromeand states that,> “Just one extra copy of the smallest chromosome, with its thousand or so> normal genes, is sufficient to cause the syndrome.”The existence of ‘normal’ genes in the presence of abnormal chromosomesindicates that ‘genetic’ factors’ do not contribute to the occurrence of Down’ssyndrome.Although it is not uncommon for babies born with Down’s syndrome to grow to fulladulthood, many do not survive, as Dr Rasnick indicates in his article,> “Most Down’s foetuses are spontaneously aborted. Nonetheless, the imbalance is> small enough (47 chromosomes) to permit occasional live births.”The error in chromosome 21 that results in Down’s syndrome occurs in the germcells, which means that all these cells contain the error. The variation in the‘viability’ of a foetus indicates that the factors that influence the occurrenceof this chromosomal ‘error’ are of a varying intensity.Cell division errors can affect chromosomes other than chromosome 21. Theseother chromosomal errors produce ‘defects’ that are also referred to as trisomy,each type of which is identified by the affected chromosome. For example,trisomy 18, which is also called Edwards syndrome, involves an extra copy ofchromosome 18.However, most chromosomal errors other than trisomy 21 generally causeconditions in which there is a much greater level of damage. In the majority ofthese cases, the foetus is not ‘viable’ and is spontaneously aborted via a‘miscarriage’, which generally occurs in the very early weeks of pregnancy.Occasionally some babies survive to birth, but it is rare that those born withaneuploidy other than trisomy 21 live beyond their first year.The CDC web page entitled Facts about Down Syndrome states,> “Researchers know that Down Syndrome is caused by an extra chromosome, but no> one knows for sure why Down Syndrome occurs or how many different factors play> a role.”This claim that ‘no one knows’ is disingenuous; many researchers do know why itoccurs. They also know about some of the substances that have the ability tocause chromosomal damage. The authors of Uninformed Consent refer to onesubstance that is a known teratogen with the ability to interfere withchromosomes,> “Mercury has been found to produce aberrant chromosome numbers.”The timing of the exposure to mercury, or any other toxic substance, that willaffect chromosome numbers will be a crucial factor in determining the extent ofthe effect. If exposure has occurred and is passed to the foetus in the earlyweeks of the pregnancy, it can lead to ‘aberrant chromosome numbers’ that canresult in birth defects or to an ‘unviable’ life that results in a spontaneousabortion or miscarriage.Another danger posed to the developing baby results from an excess of freeradicals, which may be caused by a number of factors, especially of the toxicchemical variety, and by various combinations of these factors. Any substancethat generates a high level of free radicals that are not neutralised by anadequate supply of antioxidants in the body can damage cells; as Dr RussellBlaylock explains,> “...the huge number of free radicals produced by exposure to pesticides and> heavy metals, extreme exercise, and prolonged poor nutrition will produce the> same cellular damage to the sperm and ova as it does to other cells in the> body.”Clearly, damage to the cells of sperm and ova can result in chromosomal damageduring meiosis, and lead to aneuploidy and the various birth defects associatedwith chromosomal errors.Ionising radiation in the form of X-rays and non-ionising radiation in the formof radar were shown to be associated with Down’s syndrome more than half acentury ago; as indicated by Dr Becker in The Body Electric,> “In 1964 a group of researchers studying Down’s syndrome at the Johns Hopkins> School of Medicine, after linking the malady to excess X rays given to> pregnant women, found an unexpected further correlation with fathers working> near radar.”It has also been known for a few decades that other forms of ionising radiationcause chromosomal damage and certain ‘defects’; as Dr Rosalie Bertell states inNo Immediate Danger, which was published in 1985,> “If the radiation damage occurs in germs cells, the sperm or ovum, it can> cause defective offspring.”Other evidence that non-ionising radiation can cause chromosomal damage isindicated by a 2008 article entitled Increased levels of numerical chromosomeaberrations after in vitro exposure of human peripheral blood lymphocytes toradiofrequency electromagnetic fields for 72 hours. The title of this article,which is published in the BioInitiative Report 2012, is self-explanatory.It is clear, therefore, that, contrary to the claim of the NDSS, there are anumber of environmental factors that have been proven to cause the chromosomalabnormalities associated with Down’s syndrome; these environmental factors aretoxins that include chemicals and electromagnetic radiation, both of whichgenerate free radicals. An increased body burden of toxins for either parentproduces increased levels of damaging free radicals that can adversely affectthe outcome of cell division. A high body burden of toxins that have accumulatedover the course of many years is one of the main reasons that ‘older’ women maybe more likely to give birth to babies with Down’s syndrome than younger women.Spina BifidaThe establishment definition of spina bifida refers to,> “a developmental defect in which the newborn baby has part of the spinal cord> and its coverings exposed through a gap in the backbone.”Spina bifida is a condition within the group called ‘neural tube defects’(NTDs); these are defined by the establishment as,> “a group of congenital abnormalities caused by failure of the neural tubes to> form normally.”The Mayo Clinic web pages about spina bifida include a page entitled Symptomsand Causes which, under the heading Causes, makes the familiar statement that,> “Doctors aren’t certain what causes spina bifida.”This page continues with another familiar statement that,> “As with many other problems, it appears to result from a combination of> genetic and environmental risk factors…”The ‘risk factors’ referred to include folate deficiency, some medications,diabetes, obesity and a family history of neural tube defects. The claim thatgenetic factors are relevant is discussed in a 2009 article entitled Genetics ofhuman neural tube defects that also reports,> “...rather limited progress in delineating the molecular basis underlying most> human NTDs.”It is clear therefore, that the medical establishment possesses a poor level ofknowledge about all NTDs, not just spina bifida. According to a number ofarticles, some NTDs are associated with aneuploidy, as indicated by a 2007article entitled Chromosomal abnormalities associated with neural tube defects(1): full aneuploidy, that states,> “Fetuses with neural tube defects (NTDs) carry a risk of chromosomal> abnormalities.”It must be noted that NTDs are not considered to be caused by chromosomalabnormalities, but they have been observed to occur concurrently; whichindicates that they may have similar causal factors. In addition, the articlerefers to an increased incidence of NTDs in spontaneous abortions; which alsoindicates that the foetus had serious defects and was therefore not ‘viable’.As suggested by the Mayo Clinic, folate deficiency is regarded as one of the‘risk factors’ associated with spina bifida. In addition, a 2007 articleentitled Folate and neural tube defects refers to the protective effects offolate and claims that this effect has been,> “...established by a chain of clinical research studies over the past half> century.”Although the benefits of folate are claimed to have been ‘established’, thearticle also refers to epidemiological studies of women who followed therecommendation to increase their folic acid intake; but the result of thesestudies was, according to the article, that,> “...a reduction in NTD births did not follow promulgation of these> recommendations...”Although this does not directly prove that there are no beneficial effects froman increased intake of folic acid, it does demonstrate that the connectionbetween folic acid and spina bifida has not been established beyond doubt. Thelevel of uncertainty of the benefit of folate supplementation is demonstrated bya 2006 article entitled Neural tube defects and folate: case far from closed,which states that,> “...the mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of folic acid is far from> clear.”This uncertainty is further substantiated by a 2009 article entitled Not allcases of neural tube defect can be prevented by increasing the intake of folicacid; the title is self-explanatory.Folate is an antioxidant; which means that it can neutralise free radicals thatmay damage a developing baby. There is however, an assumption that folate andfolic acid are identical substances; this is a mistaken assumption. Folate,which is one of the B vitamins, occurs naturally in foods; folic acid, bycomparison, is a manufactured synthetic substance. Although folic acidsupplements are said to be ‘based on’ folate, they are not the same chemical;this point is clarified by Dr Joel Fuhrman in a March 2017 article entitled WhyYou Need Folate and Not Folic Acid that states,> “Folic acid is chemically different from dietary folate...”He also makes the point that supplementation is unnecessary because there areplenty of vegetables that contain folate and adds the comment that,> “Pregnancy isn’t the only time in life to focus on folate.”It is clear that folate deficiency is not the cause of spina bifida; althoughnutrient deficiencies may be contributory factors, they are not the main causesof birth defects. It is important to emphasise that attention should be paid tonutrition as a whole, not just to individual nutrients.The medical establishment considers that, in addition to folate deficiency,certain health conditions that affect the mother increase the risk of her havinga baby with spina bifida, as indicated by the NICHD (National Institute of ChildHealth and Human Development) web page entitled How many people are affected byor at risk for spina bifida?> “Women who are obese, have poorly controlled diabetes, or take certain> antiseizure medications are at greater risk of having a child with spina> bifida.”The causes of diabetes have been discussed and shown by Dr Bieler to be relatedto a ‘toxic background’; obesity may also be related to a diet that mainlycomprises processed food products that contain many toxic chemical foodadditives.However, the reference to antiseizure medications is of particular significance,as indicated by a 2003 article entitled Clinical care of pregnant women withepilepsy: neural tube defects and folic acid supplementation, which acknowledgesthat there is a higher risk for women with epilepsy to have babies withmalformations and especially NTDs. The article states,> “Most antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have been associated with such risk.> Valproate and carbamazepine have been associated specifically with the> development of neural tube defects (NTDs), especially spina bifida.”In addition to their use as antiepileptic medications, these drugs, butespecially valproate, may also be used to treat bipolar disorder. However,epilepsy and bipolar disorder are both conditions in which drug treatments arerecommended to be continued throughout pregnancy. It has previously been shownthat most drugs are untested for their human teratogenic effects; furthermore,the NHS web pages about both conditions admits that the causes of epilepsy andbipolar disorder are unknown and the reasons they occur are not fullyunderstood. According to the NHS web page about epilepsy,> “…the electrical signals in the brain become scrambled and there are sometimes> sudden bursts of electrical activity.”The discussions about EHS and the dangers of EMFs indicate some of the likelycauses of the problems with electrical signals in the brain.The establishment defines bipolar affective disorder as,> “a severe mental illness causing repeated episodes of depression, mania, or> mixed affective state.”Significantly, however, the NHS web page claims that,> “Bipolar disorder is widely believed to be the result of chemical imbalances> in the brain.”The discussion in chapter one that referred to the work of Dr Peter Breggindemonstrated that this belief has no basis in science; it is a hypothesis thathas never been scientifically established and there are no tests to determinethe existence of any such imbalance. It should be clear therefore, that nopharmaceutical drug is able to address epilepsy or bipolar disorder; but moreimportantly, the drugs used to treat these conditions are proven to be able tocause harm, especially to a developing baby. A 2014 article entitled Treatmentof bipolar disorders during pregnancy: maternal and fetal safety and challengesexpresses the perceived problems, which are that both cessation and continuationof treatments, especially valproate, are associated with harm. The article makesthe pertinent comment about the challenges of continuing medication,> “…some of the most effective pharmacotherapies (such as valproate) have been> associated with the occurrence of congenital malformations or other adverse> neonatal effects in offspring.”Some of the less serious ‘side effects’ of valproate for the person who takesthe drug include nausea and vomiting; more serious side effects include liverdysfunction. All of these effects indicate that this drug is toxic; a fact thatis substantiated by evidence that it can cause ‘malformations’; which means thatit is also teratogenic.Sudden Infant Death SyndromeSudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is also known as cot death, which is definedby the establishment as,> “the sudden unexpected death of an infant less than two years old (peak> occurrence between two and six months) from an unidentifiable cause.”The NHS web page entitled Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) provides animportant additional detail in the reference to SIDS as,> “…the sudden, unexpected and unexplained death of an apparently healthy baby.”It should be noted that the establishment defines a syndrome as,> “a combination of signs and/or symptoms that forms a distinct clinical picture> indicative of a particular disorder.”The death of a baby under any circumstances will always be an extremelytraumatic experience, a sudden death will be even more so; nevertheless, it is amisnomer to describe the sudden death of an apparently healthy baby as a‘syndrome’.The medical establishment has, however, recently amended the definition of SIDS,which now only refers to the death of an infant in the first year of life. Thesudden and unexpected death of a baby beyond their first birthday is nowreferred to as SUDC (Sudden Unexplained Death in Childhood). Whatever label maybe attached to the sudden and unexpected death of a baby or young child, themedical establishment claims that the causes are largely unknown, but that thereare a few ‘risk factors’.The NHS web page explains that most unexpected deaths occur in the first sixmonths of a baby’s life and further states that,> “Experts believe SIDS occurs at a particular stage in a baby’s development and> that it affects babies who are vulnerable to certain environmental stresses.”One of the specific ‘environmental stresses’ referred to is tobacco smoke;however, although inhaling smoke is certainly detrimental to a baby’s health, itcannot be the sole factor, otherwise all babies exposed to tobacco smoke woulddie. Although rarely, if ever, mentioned by the medical establishment, the manytoxic and often volatile chemicals in most household products, includingpersonal care products for babies, can also be contributory factors; especiallyas people are more fastidious about making sure that everything is ‘clean’ and‘germ-free’ for the new baby.All health problems are caused by a combination of factors; this includes healthproblems that affect babies. All of those factors will involve exposures totoxic substances of varying types, but some of the exposures may involve asignificant toxin at a particularly important stage of development.But the ‘stresses’ to which babies are subjected are not restricted to those inthe external environment; virtually all babies are subjected to a particular setof internal stresses, namely vaccinations, many of which are administered withinthe first few months of their lives; as indicated by the CDC web page entitledSudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) that states,> “Babies receive many vaccines when they are between 2 to 4 months old. This> age range is also the peak age for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), or> infant death that cannot be explained.”It is clear that, as with tobacco smoke, babies do not all die when vaccinated.Nevertheless, vaccines contain many highly toxic ingredients; which means thatthey cannot be exempted from the category of ‘contributory factors’.Unsurprisingly, the concurrence of the peak age for SIDS and the age at whichmany vaccines are administered is claimed by the medical establishment to be apure ‘coincidence’ and that there is absolutely no causal relationship betweenthese two events. This vehement denial of any direct causal relationship isdemonstrated by an article entitled Six common misconceptions about immunizationon the WHO website; one of the ‘misconceptions’ is stated to be that,> “...vaccines cause many harmful side effects, illnesses and even death.”The idea that this claim is a ‘misconception’ is egregious for reasons that havebeen discussed, particularly in chapter two. Nevertheless, the articlespecifically refers to reported claims about a correlation between the DTPvaccine and SIDS, and states that this is ‘a myth that won’t go away’, but whichhad arisen,> “...because a moderate proportion of children who die of SIDS have recently> been vaccinated with DTP...”DTP is not the only vaccine that has been associated with the death of an infantsoon after its administration. The ever-increasing number of vaccines that areadministered to babies in the routine schedules of most countries has led tomany of them being administered simultaneously in ever-larger multiples. Forexample, the triple DTP has largely been replaced by a hexavalent vaccine thatis claimed to immunise against diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis,hepatitis B, inactivated poliovirus and Haemophilus influenzae type B.The discussion about polio demonstrated the efforts of the medical establishmentto deny the existence of an association between vaccines and an adverse event,such as paralysis, which has frequently followed the administration of vaccines,by the creation of a new condition called AFP; the discussions in chapter eightdemonstrate that AFP affects an increasing number of babies in countries such asIndia.The denial that multivalent vaccines pose an even greater hazard to the baby isdemonstrated by a March 2014 article entitled Sudden infant death followinghexavalent vaccination: a neuropathologic study, which claims that no causalrelationship had been proved. Nevertheless, the article added the comment that,> “However, we hypothesize that vaccine components could have a direct role in> sparking off a lethal outcome in vulnerable babies.”The most vulnerable babies are those born prematurely; however, the medicalestablishment view is that premature babies should still be vaccinated, asindicated by the NHS web page entitled Vaccinations that, under the sub-headingVaccinations for premature babies, states,> “It’s especially important that premature babies get their vaccines on time,> from 8 weeks after birth, no matter how premature they are.”The NHS states that premature babies need to be vaccinated because they are at agreater risk of developing an ‘infection’; yet no exceptions are made for babiesthat are breastfed, even though they are acknowledged to be better ‘protected’against illness, as previously discussed.It is clear that the ‘vaccine components’ referred to in the 2014 article abovewill be a significant contributory factor for the ‘lethal outcome’ for a baby,especially a premature baby, that dies suddenly and unexpectedly soon afterreceiving a vaccination.It is also claimed by the medical establishment that a contributory factor forSIDS is that babies have often had a ‘cold’ or some other ‘infection’ prior totheir sudden death. The establishment definition of cot death includes theadditional information that,> “About half the affected infants will have had a viral upper respiratory tract> infection within the 48 hours preceding their death...”It is likely that babies with an ‘infection’ will have been treated withmedicines such as paracetamol (acetaminophen), the dangers of which have beendiscussed. However, vaccines can also cause certain symptoms that are similar tothose of a ‘cold’; as acknowledged by the WHO in the article about‘misconceptions’,> “Most vaccine adverse events are minor and temporary, such as a sore arm or> mild fever. These can often be controlled by taking paracetamol after> vaccination.”But the WHO maintains that there is no connection between vaccines and SIDS,> “As for vaccines causing death, again so few deaths can plausibly be> attributed to vaccines that it is hard to assess the risk statistically.”Assessing the risk ‘statistically’ is wholly inappropriate. The efforts tojustify vaccines include the assertion that their ‘benefits’ outweigh their‘risks’; but for any parent whose baby has died, the ‘risk’ has been 100 percent, the ‘benefit’ zero and the result devastating.The reference on the above cited NHS web page to SIDS occurring at a particularstage in a baby’s development is an important aspect of the link betweenvaccines and a baby’s death. The reason is because, as previously discussed, theendocrine system regulates growth and development and can be adversely affectedby EDCs, including the toxic ingredients of vaccines. Dr Viera Scheibner PhDalso makes this point in her 2005 article entitled Vaccination and the Dynamicsof Critical Days, in which she states,> “Scientific evidence shows that babies can have severe adverse reactions to> vaccinations at critical intervals following their shots, and that vaccination> is the more likely cause of cot death and shaken baby syndrome.”There is an abundance of evidence about infant deaths following vaccinations toimplicate them as a major contributory factor to many, if not most, cases ofSIDS.Some research implicates other contributory factors, but indicates that vaccinesmay play the role of a ‘trigger’ for SIDS in the presence of these otherfactors. One of these theories is indicated by the Mayo Clinic web page aboutSIDS that states,> “Although the cause is unknown, it appears that SIDS might be associated with> defects in the portion of an infant’s brain that controls breathing and> arousal from sleep.”Dr Viera Scheibner and her husband, Leif Karlsson, have studied the significanceof breathing difficulties in cases of SIDS. In her 1991 article entitled CotDeaths Linked to Vaccinations, Dr Scheibner refers to ‘Stress-Induced BreathingPatterns’ that can occur in a baby during illness, teething or other ‘insults’to the body, including vaccinations. A baby may also develop breathingdifficulties due to exposures to various toxins, including volatile chemicalsthat are used in many cleaning products for example.Another factor that has been associated with SIDS is a deficiency of serotonin(5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT). A February 2010 article entitled BrainstemSerotonergic Deficiency in Sudden Infant Death Syndrome describes the problemand reports that,> “Serotonin levels were 26% lower in SIDS cases...”The article proposes that SIDS results from an abnormality in the serotoninsystem that,> “...causes an inability to restore homeostasis following life-threatening> challenges...”The article reports that the systems involved in homeostasis are stilldeveloping during the first year of life; as previously discussed, the endocrinesystem is part of the system that maintains homeostasis. It should be clear thatthe toxic ingredients of vaccines would be significant contributors to the‘life-threatening challenges’ to which the article refers. Furthermore, thearticle proposes a ‘triple-risk model’ for SIDS, which is,> “...the simultaneous occurrence in the infant of an underlying vulnerability,> a critical developmental period, and an exogenous stressor.”Another significant factor for the incidence of SIDS involves serotonin levelsthat are disrupted by the psychiatric medications known as SSRIs (selectiveserotonin reuptake inhibitors). A January 2013 report entitled Adverse Effectson Infants of SSRI/SNRI Use During Pregnancy and Breastfeeding links the use ofSSRI antidepressants by expectant mothers to an increased risk of SIDS. Thereport discusses the comparison between SIDS deaths and non-SIDS deaths andrefers to findings which indicated that SIDS deaths were found to have serotoninabnormalities that were,> “...in the serotonin pathway in the regions of the brainstem which regulate> such basic functions such as body temperature, breathing, blood pressure and> heart rate...”These critical functions are regulated by the endocrine system; this indicates,therefore, that SSRIs are endocrine disruptors. Although the full extent oftheir endocrine effects has not been studied, SSRIs have been shown to adverselyaffect certain vital functions associated with the endocrine system. Theconclusion to the above cited 2013 report includes the statement that,> “There is significant evidence that the harm caused to neonates by exposure to> and withdrawal from SRIs during pregnancy and after birth can lead to sudden> infant death...”The term SRI includes SNRIs (serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors) aswell as SSRIs.The dangers of SSRIs have been discussed in chapter one; it should be obviousthat SNRIs will be similarly dangerous. The use of these pharmaceuticals duringpregnancy substantially increases the risk of harm to the unborn baby; asituation that could account for an ‘underlying vulnerability’ that would weakenthe ability of a baby’s system to resist the effects of the toxins administeredby vaccines.Another point of significance is that serotonin and melatonin areinterconnected, as indicated by a 2003 web page entitled The Pineal Gland andMelatonin that states,> “The precursor to melatonin is serotonin, a neurotransmitter that itself is> derived from the amino acid tryptophan.”This clearly indicates the close connection between different hormones as wellas other natural body chemicals, such as amino acids. It is for this reason thatinterference with the production of any single hormone can upset homeostasis andcause many different adverse effects. The problems associated with low levels ofmelatonin include SIDS, as indicated by a 1990 article entitled Melatoninconcentrations in the sudden infant death syndrome that states,> “...CSF melatonin levels were significantly lower among the SIDS infants than> those dying of other causes.”CSF is cerebrospinal fluid. The significance of melatonin was discussed in thesection about EHS; it is however important to reiterate that newborn babies donot produce and secrete melatonin immediately after birth; they graduallydevelop this function over the course of time. Nevertheless, babies requiremelatonin, which is usually provided by the mother through breastfeeding.Melatonin is a powerful antioxidant; which means that it is capable of reducingthe adverse effects of the toxic chemical ingredients of vaccines. A low levelof melatonin would therefore contribute to a baby’s poorly functioningdetoxification system.There are other factors that may contribute to the build-up of toxic matter in ababy’s body that cannot be adequately eliminated; these have been discussed, butit must be noted that they will also include many products that are specificallyintended for use with babies. For example, some of the toxins that have beenimplicated in SIDS cases include chemicals used as fire-retardants.Other hazards to which newborn babies are exposed are the chemicals used inclothing fabrics, as well as those used in dyes and plastics for printed imageson clothes; they also include chemicals used in cot mattress materials andbedding. Furthermore, many baby care products contain the same toxic ingredientsas adult products; baby shampoos, lotions and powders, for example, containphthalates.Chemicals are not the sole source of potential health hazards for babies;exposures to EM radiation are also implicated. The discussion about EHS referredto the work of Dr Neil Cherry who demonstrated that EM radiation reducedmelatonin levels; as discussed above, SIDS is often associated with reducedmelatonin levels. Dr Cherry also associates EM radiation with increased levelsof serotonin; which is certainly indicative of an imbalance in theserotonin/melatonin metabolism.In view of the variety of hazards to which babies are often subjected it is atestament to the amazing resilience of the human body that the vast majority ofthem do survive and thrive. Unfortunately, it is becoming increasingly obviousthat a significant majority of babies, young children and young adults are farless healthy than they ought to be.AutismThe establishment defines autism as,> “a psychiatric disorder of childhood, with an onset before the age of 2½> years. It is marked by severe difficulties in communicating and forming> relationships with other people, in developing language, and in using abstract> concepts; repetitive and limited patterns of behaviour; and obsessive> resistance to tiny changes in familiar surroundings.”The symptoms associated with autism are diverse; they can manifest in a widevariety of combinations and with varying degrees of severity. Autism is not,however, regarded as a single ‘disorder’ but as a range of conditions that arecategorised under the generic label ‘autism spectrum disorder’ (ASD).Interestingly, and in common with most of the health problems discussed in thischapter, the medical establishment acknowledges that many aspects of autism,including its causes, are poorly understood or even unknown.Also interesting is that the CDC web page entitled What is Autism SpectrumDisorder? states that,> “Diagnosing ASD can be difficult since there is no medical test, like a blood> test, to diagnose the disorders.”A diagnosis of ASD in the US will usually be based on the criteria containedwithin the DSM-5 (the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fifth Edition, of theAmerican Psychiatric Association). These criteria require doctors to makeassessments of various behaviours that a child displays, as the CDC page states,> “Doctors look at the child’s behavior and development to make a diagnosis.”A diagnosis of ASD outside of the US may also be based on the criteria withinthe DSM-5 or it may be based on the criteria within the ICD-10, which is thedisease classification system of the WHO; as discussed at the beginning of thischapter.ASDs are claimed to develop during the early years of life, as indicated by theApril 2018 WHO fact sheet entitled Autism spectrum disorders, which states that,> “ASDs begin in childhood and tend to persist into adolescence and adulthood.”This means that an adolescent or adult who has been diagnosed with ASD later inlife is deemed to have almost certainly had the condition since their childhood,even though it had remained undiagnosed; as the fact sheet indicates,> “In most cases the conditions are apparent during the first 5 years of life.”The fact sheet claims that ASDs affect an estimated 1 in 160 children worldwideand states that,> “Available scientific evidence suggests that there are probably many factors> that make a child more likely to have an ASD, including environmental and> genetic factors.”The claim that ‘genetic factors’ may be involved is not, however, corroboratedby geneticists; as indicated by Dr Russell Blaylock, who reports in his 2008article entitled Vaccines, Neurodevelopment and Autism Spectrum Disorders that,> “...geneticists were quick to respond that genetic disorders do not suddenly> increase in such astronomical proportions.”Dr Blaylock states in his article that the incidence of autism in the US in 1983was 1 child in 10,000. The CDC web page entitled Data & Statistics on AutismSpectrum Disorder contains a table that displays the rates of ASD for 8-year-oldchildren surveyed at 2-year intervals between 2000 and 2014. The table showsthat the rate of ASD for 8-year-olds surveyed in the year 2000 was 1 in 150; in2010 the rate had risen to 1 in 68; by 2014, it had reached 1 in 59. At the timeof writing, 2014 is the most recent year for which the ASD rates in the US areavailable.The WHO fact sheet refers to the increase in the global prevalence of ASD duringthe past 50 years and states that,> “There are many possible explanations for this apparent increase, including> improved awareness, expansion of diagnostic criteria, better diagnostic tools> and improved reporting.”The description of the increase as ‘apparent’ is disingenuous, as demonstratedby the marked increase in the CDC’s acknowledged rate of ASD in the US betweenthe years 2000 and 2014. Furthermore, the factors referred to by the WHO aremerely recording tools; they fail to offer a genuine explanation for theexistence of autism, its continually increasing incidence or the rapidity withwhich it continues to increase. This is particularly significant with respect tothe US where the incidence of 1 in 59 is far higher than the worldwide incidenceof 1 in 160.The real reasons for the rapid rise in the incidence of autism owe their originto a variety of ‘environmental factors’, as this discussion will demonstrate.Although the establishment definition describes autism as a ‘psychiatricdisorder’, ASD is more commonly referred to as a ‘mental disorder’; these termsare, however, regarded as synonymous and often used interchangeably. The CDCwebsite contains many pages about Children’s Mental Health; the web pageentitled What Are Childhood Mental Disorders? states that,> “Mental disorders among children are described as serious changes in the way> children typically learn, behave, or handle their emotions, which cause> distress and problems getting through the day.”One of the mental disorders referred to as ‘common’ in childhood is ADHD. Thepage also states that,> “Childhood mental disorders can be treated and managed.”Treatment for these conditions may entail the use of pharmaceutical drugs,although this is not always the case. However, and more disturbingly, the age atwhich a child can be diagnosed with a ‘mental disorder’ and treated with drugshas no lower limit, as indicated by a May 2014 CCHR (Citizens Commission onHuman Rights) article entitled Watchdog Says Report of 10,000 Toddlers on ADHDDrugs Tip of the Iceberg. The article refers to documents obtained by CCHR fromIMR Health that report statistics for the US for the year 2013; these statisticsstate that, in the age range of birth to 1 year there were: 249,669 infants onanti-anxiety drugs; 26,406 on antidepressants; 1,422 on ADHD drugs and 654 onantipsychotics. The number of psychiatric drugs prescribed for 2- to 3-year oldtoddlers were even higher. In addition, the article reports that the totalnumber of children under the age of 18 who were taking psychiatric drugs were:over 1 million between birth and 5 years of age; over 4 million between the agesof 6 and 12; and over 3 and a half million between 13 and 17.The reason these drugs are prescribed for children with ‘mental disorders’ suchas ADHD, is because they are claimed to be able to correct a ‘chemical imbalancein the brain’; however, as discussed in chapter one, there is no test that isable to determine the existence of any such ‘chemical imbalance’, and there isno evidence that psychiatric drugs could correct such an imbalance, even if itwere to exist. Dr Peter Breggin, who constantly refers to these problemsthroughout his work, asserts that these drugs are dangerous and eminentlycapable of producing a variety of adverse effects, including many of thesymptoms for which they are commonly prescribed.Psychiatric drugs may also be prescribed for children diagnosed with ASD. In hisFebruary 2014 article entitled $1.5 Million Award in Child Tardive DyskinesiaMalpractice, Dr Breggin refers to a case in which he testified as thepsychiatric expert and explains that,> “...the boy was diagnosed with autism as a child and then started on SSRI> antidepressants before the age of seven.”Tardive dyskinesia is a condition in which the symptoms include involuntaryrepetitive movements; it is officially recognised to be associated with thelong-term use of certain psychiatric ‘medications’, which clearly demonstratesthat, as Dr Breggin states,> “...psychiatric drugs do much more harm than good in treating autistic> children...”ASD is also referred to as a ‘developmental disability’; the CDC web pageentitled Developmental Disabilities describes them as,> “…a group of conditions due to an impairment in physical, learning, language,> or behavior areas.”Of particular concern is that, according to the CDC page,> “About one in six children in the US have one or more development disabilities> or other developmental delays.”The page claims that most developmental disabilities, including ASD, exist atbirth, but this is not always the case. A substantial proportion of childrendiagnosed with ASD experience developmental regression, as described by a 2013article entitled Evidence of neurodegeneration in autism spectrum disorder,which states that,> “Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurological disorder in which a> significant number of children experience a developmental regression> characterized by a loss of previously-acquired skills and abilities.”The article explains that a loss of neurological function can be described asneurodegeneration and states that,> “…the issue of neurodegeneration in ASD is still under debate.”The scale of developmental regression in the US is reported in a 2015 articleentitled Developmental regression in autism spectrum disorder, which statesthat,> “About one-third of young children with ASD lose some skills during the> preschool period…”The importance of developmental regression and neurodegeneration cannot beoverstated; together they demonstrate that a loss of previously-acquired skillsand abilities is almost certainly the result of disruptions to neurologicalfunctioning that occur during the first few years of life when a child’s brainand nervous system are at critical stages of development. The most likely causesof disruptions to neurological functions and development will include exposuresto neurotoxic substances.There are various sources of exposure to neurotoxic substances; one of them,however, namely vaccination, is of particular significance with respect tochildren in their first years of life. Unsurprisingly, the medical establishmentvehemently denies that there is any association between autism and vaccines,especially the MMR vaccine; as demonstrated by the WHO fact sheet about ASDswhich claims that,> “Available epidemiological data are conclusive that there is no evidence of a> causal association between measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, and ASD.”This denial of a causal association is extended to apply to all vaccines, notjust the MMR, as the fact sheet also claims,> “There is also no evidence to suggest that any other childhood vaccine may> increase the risk of ASD.”These claims are not only disingenuous, they are erroneous. The discussions inchapter two demonstrated that all vaccines pose genuine risks to health due tothe toxic nature of many of their ingredients. Whilst it may be virtuallyimpossible to prove beyond doubt that a specific vaccine is the sole cause of aspecific adverse health event following its administration, it is beyond doubtthat vaccines are eminently capable of ‘triggering’ the onset of a variety ofhealth problems, including neurological problems, by virtue of the toxic andneurotoxic properties of their ingredients.Although the exact number may vary according to the country in which a child isborn, the majority of vaccines are usually administered before the age of 24months; an age that closely correlates with the average age at whichdevelopmental regression occurs; as indicated by the previously cited 2015article, which states that,> “…the average reported age of regression was around 20 months of age.”Unfortunately, but unsurprisingly, the medical establishment denies that thiscorrelation is indicative of a causal association; but their denial isdisingenuous.It is indisputable that the number of vaccine doses administered during thefirst two years of a child’s life has increased substantially since the early1980s. However, the health problems associated with vaccinations are notrestricted to ASD or to developmental regression. As the discussions in chaptertwo demonstrated, vaccines have been causally associated with a variety ofadverse health events that include infant mortality. An investigation thatcompared vaccination schedules and IMR (infant mortality rate) in 34 countries,including the US, is reported in a 2011 article entitled Infant mortalityregressed against number of vaccine doses routinely given: Is there abiochemical or synergistic toxicity? In the article, Neil Z Miller and Gary SGoldman report their finding that the countries with the lowest IMR were thosethat administered the fewest vaccines within the first year of a child’s life.They discovered that the US, which administers the most vaccines, had thehighest IMR.An additional fact identified by the investigation reported in the article isthat the number of premature births in the US had also increased in recentdecades. The discussion in this chapter about SIDS indicated that babies bornprematurely are particularly vulnerable, but nevertheless receive the standardseries of vaccines at the same ‘age’ after birth as babies born at full term.The fact that most babies and small children do not experience developmentalregression or die soon after receiving a vaccine, does not mean that they havenot been harmed by it. In the vast majority of cases, there are no obvious signsof harm; but cells and tissues within the child’s body will be damaged by theneurotoxic ingredients of vaccines, although at a subclinical level. The extentof the damage will vary as it depends on a number of factors, as will bediscussed in chapter ten; however, in some cases, the damage may contribute toneurological health problems that manifest later in life.The claim by the medical establishment that there is no causal link betweenvaccines and autism is said to be ‘evidence-based’; but this claim clearlyignores the mounting evidence that there is a very close link between them. Inhis previously cited 2008 article, Dr Blaylock discusses the issue of ‘evidence’and the fact that different standards seem to apply depending on the source ofthe evidence; he refers to the existence of,> “...an incredible double standard when it comes to our evidence versus> theirs.”Nowhere is this double standard more apparent than in its application toevidence relating to vaccines, especially with respect to their safety; as DrBlaylock states,> “The proponents of vaccination safety can just say that they are safe, without> any supporting evidence what-so-ever, and it is to be accepted without> question.”The same can be said for statements by the proponents of vaccinations withrespect to their efficacy.The claim that vaccines are based on ‘science’ was shown in chapter two to be acomplete fallacy; a conclusion reached by Dr M Beddow Bayly whose words werequoted in that chapter but bear repetition,> “Of scientific basis or justification for the practice there is none...”Chapter two referred to a number of vaccine ingredients and, although none ofthem can be regarded as harmless, three of them are particularly pertinent toautism; these are mercury, aluminium and formaldehyde, all of which arerecognised as neurotoxic.Previous discussions have referred to the acknowledged fact that there is no‘safe’ dose of mercury. In Health and Nutrition Secrets, Dr Blaylock discussesthe processes involved in the development of the human brain, including theproduction of important enzymes; he continues,> “Mercury, as an enzyme poison, interferes with this meticulous process,> causing the brain to be ‘miswired’.”He expands on the process he refers to as ‘miswiring’ and explains theconsequences,> “The process of miswiring can result in anything from mild behavioral and> learning problems to major disorders such as autism and other forms of> cerebral malfunction.”The discussion in chapter two also referred to the use of aluminium as a vaccineadjuvant; which means that its purpose is to ‘boost’ the body’s reaction to thevaccine to create ‘immunity’. The body does react to vaccines; but not in theway described by the medical establishment. The body’s reactions are not theresult of the immune system’s response to a ‘germ’; instead, they are the body’sefforts to expel toxins. The consequences of introducing aluminium into the bodyare explained by Dr Blaylock,> “It is known that aluminum accumulates in the brain and results in> neurodegeneration.”Formaldehyde, the third neurotoxic vaccine ingredient, generally receives lessattention than mercury or aluminium, but is similarly harmful. The discussionsin chapter two indicated that the justification for the use of this carcinogenicneurotoxin in vaccines is based on the claim that the body produces it‘naturally’. However, formaldehyde is recognised to be highly reactive and todisplay ‘strong electrophilic properties’; these properties suggest that itspresence in the body does not contribute beneficially to any of the body’snormal biochemical reactions. The discussions in chapter six indicated that thepresence of formaldehyde in the human body is more likely to be the result ofdirect exposures to this volatile chemical due to its use as an ingredient ofmany products; it may also result from the metabolism of other chemicals, suchas methanol for example.There are recognised adverse health effects from exposure to formaldehyde; someof those effects are developmental and therefore relevant to childhood healthproblems, including ASD. A March 2013 article entitled Toxic effects offormaldehyde on the urinary system provides a table of the effects that havebeen discovered and the systems that have been affected. The article reportsthat effects on the central nervous system include behavioural disorders andconvulsions, both of which are associated with ASD. A November 2015 articleentitled Formaldehyde: A Poison and Carcinogen published by The Vaccine Reactionhighlights the problem,> “One might assume that, since formaldehyde is routinely used in many vaccines> given to babies, even tiny and vulnerable premature babies, studies would have> looked at whether it is safe to inject this poison into their immature> systems.”Unfortunately, however, the article states that,> “No such studies appear to have been done.”In the absence of such studies, there is no basis for the claim that it is safeto inject this toxic substance into the body of any person, but more especiallyinto the vulnerable body of a tiny baby. The vaccines that contain formaldehydeinclude diphtheria and pertussis, both of which are administered withinmultivalent vaccines, three doses of which are given to babies prior to the ageof six months; the association between the DTP vaccine and SIDS has beendiscussed.There is other evidence that formaldehyde is highly likely to be a contributoryfactor to the onset of autism; this has been demonstrated from the results ofanimal studies conducted by Dr Woodrow Monte, who noticed that, in addition tobirth defects, there were other effects, which he describes in While ScienceSleeps as,> “...a much more subtle but significant inability to interact normally with the> environment, with a general cognitive slowness that might be as close as> animal pups can bring us to autism.”It should also be noted that some vaccines, including the MMR, contain MSG,which has been discussed and shown to be neurotoxic.It is impossible to discuss autism and its association with vaccines withoutreferring to Dr Andrew Wakefield MD, albeit very briefly, as his story serves todemonstrate the atrocious attitude of the medical establishment towards anyonewho dares to suggest the possibility that vaccinations may not be as safe andeffective as they are claimed to be. Dr Wakefield describes the events in hisbook entitled Callous Disregard, in which he explains that,> “On February 28, 1998, twelve colleagues and I published a case series paper> in The Lancet, a respected medical journal, as an ‘Early Report’. The paper> described the clinical findings in 12 children with an autistic spectrum> disorder (ASD) occurring in association with a mild-to-moderate inflammation> of the large intestine (colitis).”This now ‘infamous’ paper has been withdrawn from The Lancet and, when reportedin the mainstream media, is erroneously referred to as ‘discredited’ and‘fraudulent’. Although reported as such, the study that was conducted was not aninvestigation of a possible correlation between the MMR vaccine and autism. DrWakefield and his colleagues had investigated the presence of a variety ofgastrointestinal symptoms presented by the children diagnosed with ‘autism’. Itwas incidental to the investigation that some of the parents reported that theirchildren’s symptoms had begun soon after they had received the MMR vaccine.Despite the public denial of any link between vaccines and autism, privately theestablishment, particularly in the US, has undertaken a very different approachthat began seven years before his paper was published; as Dr Wakefield explains,> “...as a matter of fact, the US vaccine court began compensating for cases of> vaccine-caused autism starting in 1991, and the US Department of Health and> Human Services has been secretly settling cases of vaccine-caused autism> without a hearing also since 1991.”Autism is, however, only one of the many vaccine-related ‘adverse events’ thathave been compensated by the Fund, although, as discussed in chapter two, moreclaims are rejected than accepted for compensation. But the rejection of a claimdoes not mean that the adverse event was not vaccine-related.The treatment of Dr Wakefield by the medical establishment, which included hisbeing struck off the medical register in the UK, would seem to indicate that heis being held as an example of what could happen to any other researcher, doctoror scientist who may decide to challenge, or even question, the safety orefficacy of vaccines. The medical establishment has made it abundantly clearthat such courage could jeopardise or even terminate a person’s career.It should be clear that ‘science’ cannot progress amidst a climate of fear;historically it has always progressed through innovative research undertaken bypioneers.Although courageous in the face of the harsh criticism of his work, Dr Wakefielddid not conduct pioneering research; his investigation had discovered theexistence of a correlation between children diagnosed with an ASD andinflammation within their digestive systems. The close and causal associationbetween digestive problems and ill-health has been known for centuries;Hippocrates, for example, is credited with stating that ‘all disease begins inthe gut’.In her book entitled Gut and Psychology Syndrome, Dr Natasha Campbell-McBride MDalso discusses the problem of inflammation in the gut, and refers to theclinical findings of Dr Wakefield and his colleagues; she mentions that theteam,> “...found various stages of chronic inflammation in the gut of these children,> erosions of the mucous membranes of the colon and intestines, abscesses filled> with pus, ulcers and plenty of faecal impaction.”These are serious digestive system problems, which, as Dr Campbell-McBride hasalso discovered, frequently occur in children with a variety of health problems;she states that,> “I have yet to meet a child with autism, ADHD/ADD, asthma, eczema, allergies,> dyspraxia or dyslexia, who has not got digestive abnormalities.”The serious nature of these digestive abnormalities indicates a long-termbuild-up of toxic material in the body caused by an inability to properly digestand process foods as well as eliminate the waste products of digestion.The WHO fact sheet also recognises that ASD is frequently accompanied by otherhealth problems and states that,> “Individuals with ASD often present other co-occurring conditions, including> epilepsy, depression, anxiety and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder> (ADHD).”The co-occurrence of epilepsy and ASD may seem surprising as they are notperceived to be similar conditions; however, epilepsy clearly involvesimpairment of neurological functioning that affects the brain, as indicated bythe establishment definition that refers to epilepsy as,> “a disorder of brain function characterized by recurrent seizures that have a> sudden onset.”The February 2019 WHO fact sheet entitled Epilepsy claims that the most commonform is ‘idiopathic’; which means that it does not have an identifiable cause.However, any disruption to neurological functioning strongly suggests theinvolvement of neurotoxic substances and influences. Unfortunately, the vastmajority of chemicals remain untested with respect to their neurotoxic effects;as discussed in a 2011 article entitled Environmental neurotoxicants anddeveloping brain, which states that,> “Only about 200 chemicals out of more than 80,000 registered with the United> States Environmental Protection Agency have undergone extensive neurotoxicity> testing, and many chemicals found in consumer goods are not required to> undergo any neurodevelopment testing.”The significance of this dearth of neurotoxicity testing cannot beover-emphasised in the context of babies and young children, whose bodilysystems and organs are still undergoing development, but can nevertheless beexposed to a variety of neurotoxic chemicals used as ingredients in a widevariety of consumer products. The article refers to the dangers from theseexposures and states that,> “The timing and duration of neurotoxicant exposures during development can> give rise to a broad spectrum of structural and functional deficits.”The reference in the article to ‘deficits’ that occur due to the timing ofexposures to toxicants is extremely important. As previously discussed,disruptions to the endocrine system can result from exposures to incrediblyminute concentrations of chemicals and, when they occur in the body of apregnant woman, these disruptions may have an adverse impact on the developingbaby. In some cases, the effects may not be readily identifiable at birth, butmay manifest at a later stage and be triggered by an increased body burden ofneurotoxic substances, such as those used in vaccines.Although the WHO fact sheet correctly indicates that there are many factorsinvolved in generating ASDs, it fails to fully acknowledge the major role ofneurotoxic chemicals in the onset of these disorders, due to their ability todisrupt ‘normal’ development during a child’s formative years. There is,however, a growing body of evidence that demonstrates a direct associationbetween exposures to neurotoxins and developmental problems that may bediagnosed as an ASD; as indicated by a 2013 article entitled The Dynamics ofAutism Spectrum Disorders: How Neurotoxic Compounds and NeurotransmittersInteract that states,> “Accumulating evidence shows that exposure to neurotoxic compounds is related> to ASD.”The neurotoxic compounds referred to in the article include phthalates as wellas organophosphate and organochlorine pesticides, amongst others. The articlestates that these neurotoxic compounds are ‘hypothesised’ to affect certainneurotransmitter systems, including the GABAergic system. The term GABA refersto gamma-Aminobutyric acid. In addition, the previously cited 2013 article thatrefers to neurodegeneration in ASD states that,> “To date, the etiology of ASD remains under debate. There are, however, many> studies that suggest toxicity in children with ASD.”Although the neurotoxic ingredients of vaccines can certainly be included ascontributory factors, or even ‘triggers’, for the onset of ASD, vaccines are notthe only sources of childhood exposures to neurotoxic substances and influences.As discussed in chapter six, some of the ingredients of personal care products,including those specifically intended for use on babies and small children,contain toxic substances, including neurotoxic compounds such as phthalates.The disruptions to normal functions associated with ASD may affect a number ofthe body’s systems, including the endocrine system and the hormones itregulates. As discussed earlier in this chapter, very few chemicals have beentested to determine their effects on the endocrine system; however, disruptionto hormone levels has been shown to be associated with ASDs, as indicated by aNovember 2014 article entitled The serotonin-N-acetylserotonin-melatonin pathwayas a biomarker for autism spectrum disorders, which states that,> “Elevated whole-blood serotonin and decreased plasma melatonin...have been> reported independently in patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs).”The discussion in chapter six about non-ionising radiation explained thatmelatonin is an extremely important hormone, and that disruption to itsproduction can have significant adverse effects, including sleep disturbance. A2015 article entitled Melatonin in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders: HowDoes the Evidence Fit Together? indicates that some of the adverse effectsassociated with ASD are the result of disturbances to the serotonin-melatoninpathway,> “There is also strong evidence supporting an involvement of the> serotonin-N-acetylserotonin-melatonin pathway in the etiology of ASD.”As previously discussed in this section, children of all ages, especially in theUS, are increasingly ‘medicated’ with psychiatric drugs, which include SSRIs(selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) that are used to treat various ‘mentaldisorders’ on the basis of the idea that an increased level of serotonin willhelp to ‘ease’ the problem. In common with all pharmaceuticals, SSRIs areassociated with a number of ‘side effects’, including insomnia. However, anexcess level of serotonin in the brain can induce symptoms such as agitation; ofeven greater concern, is that, if the level of serotonin becomes too high, itcan lead to extremely serious effects, such as seizures or a loss ofconsciousness.It is clear that children may be directly exposed to toxic and neurotoxicsubstances that may affect their development during the first years of life;however, they may also be exposed to toxic and neurotoxic substances prior tobirth if the mother has been prescribed pharmaceutical ‘medicines’ duringpregnancy.As discussed in chapter one, depression is one of the most common types of‘mental disorder’ and, according to the previously cited WHO fact sheet entitledMental Disorders, women are more affected by depression than men. One of thereasons that depression is more frequently experienced by women may be due tomaternal depression, which may occur either during or after pregnancy, or both.It is not uncommon, especially in the US, for pregnant women to be prescribedantidepressants, including SSRIs. The justification for the use ofantidepressants during pregnancy is explained in a 2008 article entitled ACOGGuidelines on Psychiatric Medication Use During Pregnancy and Lactation, whichstates that,> “Untreated maternal depression is associated with increased rates of adverse> outcomes…”ACOG is the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The articleacknowledges that there are also potential risks of adverse outcomes as theresult of the treatment of depression with antidepressants, both prenatal andpostnatal, and admits that these outcomes may include birth defects,> “There is limited evidence of teratogenic effects from the use of> antidepressants in pregnancy and adverse effects from exposure during> breastfeeding.”In his 2008 article entitled Pregnant mothers should not take antidepressants,Dr Breggin discusses a number of ‘effects’, including birth defects, that areassociated with the use of antidepressants during pregnancy. He also makes theextremely important statement that,> “Newborns also go through withdrawal when their mothers have taken> antidepressants during pregnancy.”Dr Breggin strongly recommends that people who wish to stop taking psychiatricdrugs should be supervised during the withdrawal process.Newborn babies whose mothers have taken antidepressants during pregnancy shouldalso be monitored for the effects of withdrawal. These effects are particularlysignificant with respect to the still developing brain of a newborn baby, as DrBreggin explains in his article,> “Withdrawal reactions confirm that the brain of the fetus has been bathed in> SSRIs and that it has suffered significant functional changes.”The discussion in this chapter about SIDS indicated that the use of SSRIs duringpregnancy has been associated with the subsequent death of the baby; but for thebabies that survive, the consequences can include potential, if not actual,serious adverse health effects, including autism. In his August 2014 articleentitled Autism, Antidepressants and Pregnancy: The Basics, Dr Adam Urato MDrefers to eight studies that have recently been conducted to investigate aconnection between antidepressants taken by the mother during pregnancy and asubsequent diagnosis of autism for the baby. The reason that so few studies havebeen conducted should be obvious; however, Dr Urato states that the studies thathave now been conducted show,> “...that antidepressants use during pregnancy (principally with selective> serotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs) is associated with autism in the> exposed children.”It should be clear from previous discussions that neurotoxic chemicals, whetherin vaccines, psychiatric drugs or everyday household and personal care products,are not the only hazards that can contribute to the onset of autism. There is agreat deal of evidence that an association exists between ASD and EM radiation,as discussed by Dr Andrew Goldsworthy PhD in his May 2011 article entitled, HowElectromagnetically-Induced Cell Leakage May Cause Autism, in which he statesthat,> “The first effect of non-ionising electromagnetic radiation is to generate> small alternating voltages across the cell membranes, which destabilize them> and make them leak.”He discusses the role of calcium ions in the cell membranes of the brain andindicates that weak EMR can remove these ions, which can leak into the cell. Inhis March 2012 article entitled The Biological Effects of Weak ElectromagneticFields, Dr Goldsworthy expands on the problem of electromagnetically-inducedmembrane leakage and explains that it can result in changes in the way neuronsrelease their transmitters. He states that this can lead to,> “...spurious signals that have no right to be there, which makes the brain> hyperactive and less able to concentrate.”Discussions in this chapter have shown that most chronic diseases are associatedwith the presence of oxidative stress; autism and ASDs are no exceptions. Thelink between exposure to EMR, oxidative stress and ASD is demonstrated by theBioInitiative Report 2012 article entitled Findings in Autism (ASD) Consistentwith Electromagnetic Fields (EMF) and Radiofrequency Radiation (RFR), whichstates that,> “Autism (ASD) research indicates that oxidative stress may be a common> attribute amongst many individuals with autism.”All disease processes involve damage to different organs and systems; but thereare many common features, which, in addition to oxidative stress, includedisruptions to the body’s production and release of important hormones andantioxidants. These features are also common to ASD, as the article indicates,> “At the cellular and molecular level many studies of people with ASD have> identified oxidative stress and evidence of free radical damage, evidence of> cellular stress proteins, as well as deficiencies of antioxidants such as> glutathione.”The role of cellular stress proteins is discussed in chapter ten.The article also indicates that oxidation of an important enzyme can affect thebody’s production of the hormones, serotonin and melatonin,> “Of pertinence, tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH2) – the rate limiting enzyme in> the synthesis of serotonin, from which melatonin is derived – is extremely> vulnerable to oxidation...”Furthermore, although ASDs are defined in terms of behavioural problems, thearticle states that they also involve other levels of damage and functionalproblems and that,> “...under the surface they also involve a range of disturbances of underlying> biology that find striking parallels in the physiological impacts of> electromagnetic frequency and radiofrequency exposures (EMF/RFR).”In addition to directly affecting babies and small children, EM radiationexposures can also affect babies before birth as the result of the mother’sexposures to EMF/RFR during her pregnancy. Whilst they are not claimed to havebeen proven to cause autism, these ‘disturbances’ caused by exposures to EMF/RFRcan clearly have a serious adverse effect on the health of babies in their firstfew years of life.Another interesting and highly significant comment in the article is that,> “The problem has been that no one such biological feature has turned out to be> present in every single person carrying an ASD diagnosis – and they are not> specific to ASDs either.”This situation is not exclusive to ASDs; many, if not most, diseases fail todisplay unique signs and symptoms by which they can be easily identified. Thereason for this is because, contrary to the claims of the medical establishment,‘diseases’ are not distinct entities. Instead, as will be discussed in chapterten, diseases are manifestations of different combinations of symptoms thatrepresent the body’s efforts to expel toxins, repair damage and restore health.Furthermore, as this chapter has demonstrated, there is increasing evidence thatall diseases share a common underlying mechanism, which is the excess generationof free radicals that induce oxidative stress and cause damage at the cellularlevel.Although the medical establishment claims that autism is a lifelong conditionfor which there is no cure, many children diagnosed with ASD have, throughcertain treatment approaches, achieved a dramatic reduction in their symptoms;some have even achieved a complete recovery. These successes have not, however,been gained through the usual medical establishment treatment methods, as DrBlaylock explains,> “Intrepid workers in the shadows, that is outside the medical establishment,> have worked many miracles with these children using a multidisciplinary> scientific approach completely ignored by the orthodoxy. Some children have> even experienced a return to complete physiological normalcy.”It should be clear from the discussion in this section that autism and ASDs arelargely, if not entirely, the result of ‘environmental factors’, the mostsignificant of which are: the toxic and neurotoxic chemicals used in themanufacture of vaccines, pharmaceuticals and many everyday products; andexposure to electromagnetic radiation.CancerThe establishment definition refers to cancer as ‘any malignant tumour’ andstates that,> “It arises from the abnormal, purposeless, and uncontrolled division of cells> that then invade and destroy the surrounding tissues.”Although still a dreaded disease, cancer has become almost commonplace; theincidence has increased to the extent that it is currently estimated that 1 in 3people will be diagnosed with some form of cancer during their lifetime. TheSeptember 2018 WHO fact sheet entitled Cancer states that it accounts for about1 in 6 deaths worldwide and that,> “Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally…”Statistics obtained from earlier versions of the fact sheet demonstrate thatmortality due to cancer has continued to rise; statistics for the year 2008showed that cancer accounted for 7.6 million deaths, for 2012 it had risen to8.2 million and by 2015 it had reached 8.8 million. The most recent cancerstatistics are reported in the September 2018 IARC Press Release entitled Latestglobal cancer data: Cancer burden rises to 18.1 million new cases and 9.6million cancer deaths in 2018; the title is self-explanatory.Although generally referred to as a single disease, the WHO fact sheet describescancer as,> “…a generic term for a large group of diseases that can affect any part of the> body.”Under the sub-heading What causes cancer, the fact sheet states that,> “Cancer arises from the transformation of normal cells into tumour cells in a> multistage process that generally progresses from a pre-cancerous lesion to a> malignant tumour.”This description does not explain the cause of cancer; however, the fact sheetcontinues with the statement that,> “These changes are the result of the interaction between a person’s genetic> factors and 3 categories of external agents…”These three categories of external agents are ‘physical carcinogens’, ‘chemicalcarcinogens’ and ‘biological carcinogens’, all of which are discussed in moredetail later in this section, as are ‘genetic factors’.However, despite the clear reference to carcinogens as relevant to the onset ofcancer, the fact sheet claims that cancer also results from the same four ‘riskfactors’ that apply to all NCDs and states that,> “Tobacco use, alcohol use, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity are major> cancer risk factors worldwide…”This claim is highly misleading. There is a proven association between smokingand lung cancer, which, according to the WHO fact sheet, accounts for 1.76million deaths each year. The main reason that smoking increases the risk ofdeveloping cancer is because most tobacco products contain carcinogens, such asbenzene, formaldehyde, methanol and arsenic.Alcohol is also unhealthy; it is closely associated with liver damage that mayinitially be diagnosed as cirrhosis but may lead to liver cancer. The fact thatalcohol affects the liver is indicative of its toxicity.An unhealthy diet certainly contributes to ill-health, but the association withcancer is rather different from the risk implied by the WHO fact sheet. Thefoods that contribute to the development of cancer are those that have beenproduced using substantial quantities of toxic chemicals, such as pesticides andfood additives.The reference to physical inactivity as a risk factor for cancer is, however,totally unfounded; a lack of physical activity in the absence of any otherrelevant factors does not cause or contribute to cancer.It is claimed that cancer has an ancient origin because it has been described inthe writings of both the ancient Egyptians and Greeks, including Hippocrates.These writings are cited as evidence in efforts to refute the argument thatcancer is predominantly a ‘modern’ disease and the result of industrialisation.These efforts are, however, futile because there is an abundance of evidencethat links the carcinogenic products of industrialisation to cancer, as thisdiscussion will demonstrate. Furthermore, the incidence of cancer in ancienttimes can also be explained by reference to carcinogens, as will also beexplained.Prior to the 20th century, cancer was relatively uncommon; it was not thescourge it has since become. One of the explanations for this phenomenon isbased on the theory that cancer is a disease of ageing, as indicated by the factsheet, which claims that,> “The incidence of cancer rises dramatically with age…”This is clearly a correlation, but it does not prove a causal relationship,especially as old people do not all develop cancer. The fact sheet does,however, provide a clue to the underlying problems that may explain theincreased incidence of cancer in older people, which is that it is,> “…most likely due to a build-up of risks for specific cancers that increase> with age.”The reason that cancer is more prevalent in older people is, however, because itresults from a build-up of toxins in the body, not a build-up of ‘risks’. Thisfact is acknowledged, albeit to a limited extent, in the WHO fact sheet thatstates,> “The overall risk accumulation is combined with the tendency for cellular> repair mechanisms to be less effective as a person grows older.”The reason that cellular repair mechanisms become less effective is not solelythe result of advancing years, but is far more closely related to factors thatcause them to become weakened.The theory that cancer is a disease of ageing is, however, thoroughly refuted bythe fact that children and young adults also suffer from the disease. The pageentitled Adolescents and Young Adults with Cancer on the website of the NCI(National Cancer Institute) indicates that the scale of this problem issignificant,> “Cancer is the leading cause of disease-related death in the AYA population.> Among AYAs, only accidents, suicide and homicide claimed more lives than> cancer in 2011.”The abbreviation ‘AYA’ refers to the age group between 15 and 39.The incidence of cancer is also significant in an even younger age range thatincludes all children, as indicated by the September 2018 WHO fact sheetentitled Cancer in Children, which states that,> “Cancer is a leading cause of death for children and adolescents around the> world and approximately 300,000 children aged 0 to 19 years old are diagnosed> with cancer each year.”It is clear that ‘ageing’ is not a relevant factor in the development of cancer.The incidence of cancer began to increase noticeably in the early 20th century.As this was the period during which the ‘germ theory of disease’ was in itsascendancy, microbiologists began to investigate the potential role of ‘germs’in connection with this disease. However, despite the occasional discovery of a‘virus’ in an animal tumour, there was little progress with this field ofinvestigation.After the creation of the NCI in the US in 1937, a number of differentprogrammes were developed to continue research into the causes of and treatmentsfor cancer. In the 1950s, a programme was established to develop chemotherapycancer treatments. In 1962, another programme was established to investigatepotential carcinogens in the environment. In 1964, investigations returned tothe possibility of a connection between viruses and cancer and resulted in thecreation of another programme for this field of research.In Inventing the AIDS Virus, Dr Peter Duesberg reports that, for a while, thesethree programmes ran in parallel, but that the virus programme was preferred bythe medical establishment for a number of reasons. The favouritism shown to thevirus programme enabled it to receive a larger proportion of the availablefunding and to eventually over-shadow all the other programmes, which, starvedof adequate funding, experienced severe difficulties in pursuing the researchstudies they had been set up to conduct. The preferential treatment shown to thevirus programme proved to be misplaced; the investigations conducted by thisprogramme were unable to discover any virus capable of causing cancer.Eventually this programme was abandoned and some of its researchers transferredto the research programme to investigate HIV/AIDS, as previously discussed.However, in 1971, while the ‘virus-cancer’ connection was still underinvestigation, Richard Nixon famously launched the ‘War on Cancer’. Theprincipal objective of this ‘war’ was to find the elusive cure for cancer; butthe use of military-style language encouraged a military-style approach to theproblem, and led to the implementation of methods to ‘attack’, ‘fight’ and‘kill’ the disease. This was not an entirely new approach to tackling disease,especially cancer; the purpose of this ‘war’ initiative was to intensify thecampaign against the most feared human disease.The continual rise in both morbidity and mortality from cancer demonstrates thatthis ‘war’ has been lost. The real reason for its failure is because itsapproach was based on fundamentally flawed theories about cancer, especially itscauses and treatment.One of the theories about cancer claims that ‘genes’ play a relevant role in itsdevelopment; but, despite efforts to link various genes to different forms ofcancer, this is a flawed theory. Furthermore, there is ample evidence thatdemonstrates genes do not account for many of the known aspects of cancer. Thisextremely important point is explained by Dr David Rasnick in his previouslycited 2002 article entitled, The aneuploidy theory of cancer and the barriers toits acceptance, in which he states that,> “There is a growing list of carcinogens that do not mutate genes at all. In> addition there are no cancer specific gene mutations. Even tumors of a single> organ rarely have uniform genetic alterations. And, in a rebuttal that should> be decisive, no genes have yet been isolated from cancers that can transform> normal human or animal cells into cancer cells.”As mentioned at the beginning of this section, the WHO claims that cancerouschanges involve ‘genetic factors’ that interact with three types of‘carcinogen’; namely physical, chemical and biological. The role of geneticfactors is not adequately explained in the fact sheet, but it is generallyclaimed by the medical establishment that cancers are caused by mutated genes.However, research conducted by Dr Rasnick and Dr Peter Duesberg provides anindisputable refutation of the claim that there are any cancer specific genemutations, and of the claim that genes can transform healthy cells intocancerous ones. Their research, which will be discussed later in this section,shows that ‘genetic factors’ are irrelevant to the development of cancer.Biological carcinogens are defined in the WHO fact sheet as,> “…infections from certain viruses, bacteria, or parasites.”The discussions in chapter three provide a clear refutation of the claim thatany virus, bacterium or parasite causes any ‘infection’; parasites are furtherdiscussed in chapter eight. Unfortunately, the rigid but misplaced adherence tothe ‘germ theory’ means that ‘microbes’ remain a key feature of theories aboutdisease causation, including those that relate to cancer; as demonstrated by a2014 article entitled Infection and Cancer: Global Distribution and Burden ofDiseases that states,> “Infection is one of the main contributors to cancer development.”Despite the seemingly authoritative nature of this assertion, nothing could befurther from the truth.Nevertheless, the ‘germ theory’ has become so firmly entrenched within medicalestablishment dogma that the IARC Group 1 category of definite human carcinogensincludes eleven ‘biological agents’, seven of which are viruses. Interestingly,six of the ‘infectious agents’ in this group are claimed to be,> “Indirect carcinogens that act via chronic inflammation.”The theory that biological agents can cause cancer is similarly promoted by theWHO fact sheet that states,> “Approximately 15% of cancers diagnosed in 2012 were attributed to> carcinogenic infections, including Helicobacter pylori, Human Papillomavirus> (HPV), Hepatitis B virus, Hepatitis C virus and Epstein-Barr virus.”The term ‘carcinogenic infection’ is meaningless. Firstly, ‘germs’ do not causeinfections; secondly, ‘germs’ do not transform normal cells into tumour cellsthat initiate cancer. Thirdly, and more significantly, cancer involves theproliferation of cells, whereas an ‘infection’ is said to involve thedestruction of cells; it is clear that these are entirely different mechanismsof action.This therefore means that the category of ‘biological carcinogens’ can bedismissed, as they too are irrelevant to the development of cancer.The category of ‘physical carcinogens’ however, cannot be dismissed; the WHOfact sheet acknowledges that this category includes ionising radiation, which isa proven human carcinogen, as discussed in chapter six.The category of ‘chemical carcinogens’ also cannot be dismissed. Although theWHO fact sheet only refers to a few examples, such as asbestos and arsenic, thiscategory represents the main group of relevant factors known to cause cancer.In The Secret History of the War on Cancer, Dr Devra Davis refers to the secondCancer Congress in Brussels in 1936. She reports that the discussions that tookplace revealed a significant level of knowledge about the causes of cancer,including the awareness that certain industrial compounds were carcinogenic. Onecompound that is specifically mentioned is benzene, the safe level of which wasconceded in 1948 by the American Petroleum Institute to be zero. Yet, more thanhalf a century later, benzene remains a widely-used industrial chemical, eventhough it has been officially classified by the IARC as a Group 1 carcinogen.Dr Davis also cites a 1949 article written by Groff Conklin and published in thejournal Scientific American. The article, entitled Cancer and Environment,refers to the increase in cancer mortality since 1900; it also refers toinvestigations that were being conducted in the effort to explain the increasedincidence of the disease and states that these were,> “...being sought in an environment so much more complex than it was in 1900.> The investigation is focused on carcinogenic agents...”The ‘environment’ has become even more complex and far more polluted in theintervening decades since 1949. However, although most chemicals remainuntested, one of the effects most commonly tested for is carcinogenicity, whichmeans that the list of proven carcinogens continues to expand. The list of Group1 carcinogens includes vinyl chloride, trichloroethylene, PCBs and TCDD, all ofwhich are toxic organochlorines.Nevertheless, despite their known toxicity and carcinogenicity, these compounds,and many more, continue to be widely used by industry; this means that theworkplace is a major source of regular exposure to both toxins and carcinogens.The level of exposure that each person may experience in their workplace willinevitably vary according to the type of industry and the nature of thesubstances to which they may be exposed; however, certain industries can involvesignificant risks of exposure; as Dr Epstein explains in The Politics of Cancer,> “Various categories of workers are at high risk of exposure to carcinogens.”Some of the industries he refers to in which workers can be exposed tocarcinogens include mining, metal processing and smelting, all of which areindustries that have a long history, often over many centuries. However,although the industries of the past utilised very different processes from thoseof modern industries, they would all entail exposures to a variety ofnaturally-occurring ‘poisons’, many of which have been discovered to also becarcinogenic. Gold mining, for example, is known to expose miners to bothmercury and arsenic; in addition, the disposal of ‘tailing’ wastes into thelocal environment will also expose the residents of mining areas to carcinogenicsubstances. These exposures have occurred throughout history and thereforeprovide a credible explanation for the incidence of cancer in the distant past,as well as in the present.The rapid growth of industrialisation in ‘Western’ countries has significantlyincreased the volume and concentration of environmental pollutants, includingmany that are carcinogenic. However, the increasing complexity of thecombinations of toxic and carcinogenic substances that now pervade theenvironment, makes it impossible to identify any single factor as the main causeof the phenomenal rise in the rate of cancer, especially since the mid-20thcentury.There are many difficulties entailed in devising methods to determine whether aparticular carcinogen has caused a specific case of cancer; these difficultiesarise to a certain extent from the virtual absence of any safety testingprocedures conducted prior to the release of a chemical onto the market. Theabsence of direct evidence that a substance is carcinogenic does not mean it issafe. Proof of harm caused by any substance is frequently obtained fromepidemiological studies, which are always conducted in the complex real-worldenvironment after the substance has been released onto the market.Epidemiological studies are often able to indicate the existence of acorrelation, but they are rarely able to find direct evidence of a causalrelationship.More importantly, cancer is rarely caused by exposure to a single carcinogen;except in certain circumstances, it will develop as the result of long-termexposures to many different toxic substances. The sources of these exposures canvary widely, as Dr Epstein indicates,> “The toxic and carcinogenic chemicals to which workers may be exposed at> relatively high concentrations in the workplace also are discharged or escape> into the air and water of the surrounding community. The worker may be exposed> to the same chemical carcinogens through consumer products and the general> environment as in his or her workplace.”In the ‘real-world’ environment, it is the complexity and variety ofcombinations of toxic substances to which people are regularly exposed, thatdenies epidemiological investigations the ability to demonstrate the existenceof a clear and direct relationship between a specific exposure and thedevelopment of cancer in the exposed population. This difficulty was exploitedby the tobacco industry for decades in their efforts to refute the claim thatthere was a direct link between smoking and cancer.Nevertheless, there has been the occasional incident that has enabled a directcausal association to be proved; one such incident was the disaster thatoccurred in Bhopal, India. This tragic event involved the exposure of a hugenumber of people to an extremely high level of a specific and highly toxic gas.As will be further discussed in chapter eight, this event has resulted in asubstantially increased incidence of and mortality from a number of differenttypes of cancer in the region.The difficulties of establishing a direct causal link between cancer and aspecific carcinogenic substance allows the relevant industry to claim that thereis ‘doubt’ about such a link, which also means that liability for the harmcaused can be avoided. This point is explained by David Michaels in his aptlytitled book Doubt is Their Product,> “Except for a few very rare instances in which a disease is unique to an> exposure, such as mesothelioma caused by asbestos, epidemiologists cannot> state that a specific chemical exposure has definitely caused the cancer of a> specific patient.”In addition, people who live in the vicinity of certain industries are alsoexposed to toxic and carcinogenic wastes discharged into the environment, as DrEpstein explains,> “Living near petrochemical and certain other industries in highly urbanized> communities increases cancer risks, as evidenced by clustering of excess> cancer rates; high levels of toxic and carcinogenic chemicals are deliberately> discharged by a wide range of industries into the air of surrounding> communities.”The discussions in chapter six showed that the pharmaceutical industry is one ofthose responsible for polluting the environment with toxic effluent.Exposure to carcinogens also occurs in the home from the use of everydayconsumer products, including those intended for use with babies and smallchildren. Dr Epstein provides one example in Toxic Beauty,> “For instance, many baby soaps, baby shampoos and bubble baths hide a> carcinogenic contaminant called 1,4-dioxane in a range of ingredients known as> ethoxylates.”Ethoxylates are surfactants that are used in many detergent-type products.Although 1,4-dioxane is not a member of the family of dioxins, it is listed as aGroup B2 carcinogen; which means it is a ‘probable human carcinogen’ and shouldnot therefore, be an ingredient of any consumer products, especially thoseintended for babies and small children.Dr Epstein explains that a number of ingredients commonly used in baby productshave been proven to induce cancer in laboratory animals. These are significantfindings, because it is widely acknowledged by the scientific research communitythat any substance shown to induce cancer in animals must be regarded as apotential, if not actual, human carcinogen. Whilst this may tend to argue forthe continuation of animal testing, it is a poor argument; mainly because manychemicals remain in use as product ingredients, despite being tested and shownto demonstrate carcinogenicity. The claim that animal testing leads to productsthat are ‘safe’ for human use is clearly unfounded.Talcum powder is another product that is frequently, although not exclusivelyused on babies; it is also a product that, according to Dr Epstein, has beenshown to induce cancer in laboratory animals and is ‘strongly linked’ to ovariancancer. But, although the link is only to that particular type of human cancer,the fact that talcum powder is linked to cancer in animals has implications forother forms of cancer of the female reproductive system, such as cervical cancerfor example.There are other personal care products used regularly by girls and women thatare of significant concern because of their toxic and potentially carcinogenicingredients; these products include, but are not restricted to, sanitary towelsand tampons plus feminine deodorants and wipes. The ingredients of theseproducts can include bleaching agents, which usually contain chlorine-basedchemicals, and ‘fragrance chemicals’, which commonly contain phthalates, some ofwhich are known to be carcinogenic. These chemicals are far more plausible asfactors that contribute to cervical cancer than the non-living particles thathave been called ‘viruses’.Any carcinogenic compound that is an ingredient of a product applied to the skinhas the ability to promote the development of cancer; as discussed, the skin canabsorb chemicals that are able to enter the bloodstream and spread to variousorgans and systems of the body. It should be clear, therefore, that the problemis not exclusive to women; men and boys who apply products that contain toxicand carcinogenic ingredients to their genital area, can be similarly at ‘risk’of developing a form of cancer of the reproductive system; prostate cancer, forexample. According to the NHS, the cause of prostate cancer is unknown, althoughunusually it is not claimed to be linked to any ‘infection’.Interestingly, it was discovered that young chimney sweeps in 18th centuryEngland were prone to scrotal cancer, which was shown to be directly linked totheir constant exposure to soot from the chimneys; soot contains varioushydrocarbons, some of which have since been identified as carcinogenic. It wasnot solely their exposure to soot; their risk of developing cancer wasexacerbated by a combination of factors that included their extremely poorpersonal hygiene, because they rarely washed, as well as the extremely poor andinsanitary conditions in which these boys would invariably have lived.This example further refutes the idea that cancer is a disease of ‘ageing’.One of the most common childhood cancers is leukaemia; however, a page entitledDo We Know What Causes Childhood Leukemia? on the website of the ACS (AmericanCancer Society) makes the familiar claim that,> “The exact cause of most childhood leukemias is not known.”Nevertheless, the ACS makes another familiar assertion that the ‘risk factors’for leukaemia include a ‘genetic factor’ as well as environmental risk factorsthat include ‘radiation and certain chemicals’. Leukaemia is a cancer of theblood cells; the most common form of leukaemia is ALL (acute lymphoblasticleukaemia). According to the medical establishment, the causes of ALL are alsolargely ‘unknown’; however, a 2013 article entitled Acute lymphoblasticleukaemia published in The Lancet states that,> “Ionising radiation is an established causal exposure for ALL...”Furthermore, the NHS web page about ALL refers to known risk factors that aresaid to include previous chemotherapy treatments for ‘unrelated cancers’; thepage also refers to specific chemotherapy ‘medicines’ that may have been usedfor those other cancers. The link between chemotherapy ‘treatments’ and thedevelopment of cancer is extremely important and will be discussed later in thissection.After decades of denial, it is now widely accepted by the medical establishmentthat ionising radiation is extremely dangerous; furthermore, all forms ofionising radiation are classified as Group 1 carcinogens.Although less dangerous than ionising radiation, non-ionising radiation is alsoassociated with many harmful effects, including cancers, even though this linkis still denied by the medical establishment. This denial has been discussed,but it is demonstrated by the CDC web page about childhood leukaemias thatcontains a section entitled Uncertain, unproven or controversial risk factors,which lists one of these factors as ‘exposure to electromagnetic fields’. Theidea that an association between leukaemia and exposures to EMFs is uncertain,unproven or even controversial is unfounded; there is ample evidence that EMradiation is associated with an increased risk of cancer; as demonstrated by theIARC classification of RFR and EMR as Group 2B carcinogens.There are, however, known associations between non-ionising radiation andcancers other than leukaemia; as indicated by Dr W Ross Adey MD, who, in hisarticle entitled Electromagnetic fields, the modulation of brain tissuefunctions – A possible paradigm shift in biology, states that,> “Epidemiological studies also suggest a relationship between occupational> exposure to environmental EM fields and breast cancer in women and men.”In addition, he makes the salient points that exposures are always multiple andthat EM radiation can interact synergistically with chemicals,> “Environmental EM fields may act jointly with exposure to environmental> chemicals with known cancer-promoting actions in enhancing brain tumor risks.”The point cannot be over-emphasised that the human body is both biochemical andbioelectrical in nature and that these ‘systems’ are intimately interconnected;any influence that disrupts one system will inevitably disrupt the other. It isalso important to emphasise that disease, especially cancer, is mostly theresult of multiple exposures to harmful factors usually over the course of manyyears, if not decades.In his previously cited article entitled Evidence of Health Effects ofElectromagnetic Radiation, Dr Neil Cherry refers to an association betweenreduced levels of melatonin and cancer. He also discusses the results of studiesthat he refers to as,> “...sufficient to classify a causal relationship between EMR and breast> cancer, with melatonin reduction as the biological mechanism.”The BioInitiative Report 2012 contains many articles that refer to anassociation between EMF exposures and cancers; for example, a 2003 articlerefers to aneuploidy that occurred when human lymphocytes had been exposed toEMFs and noted that,> “The effects were non-thermal.”Another BioInitiative Report 2012 article, entitled Use of Wireless Phones andEvidence for Increased Risk of Brain Tumors, refers to the vulnerability ofchildren and states that,> “The developing brain is more sensitive to toxins and it is still developing> until about 20 years of age.”This is an extremely important point as it highlights the reason that mobilephones pose a far more significant health hazard to children and young peopleunder the age of 20; the article further explains that,> “Children have smaller heads and thinner skull bone than adults. Their brain> tissue has also higher conductivity and these circumstances give higher> absorption from RF-EMF than for adults.”The Summary for the Public section of the BioInitiative Report 2012 contains areference to the existence of different studies which have shown that,> “...children who start using a mobile phone in early years have more than a> 5-fold (more than 500%) risk for developing a glioma by the time they are in> the 20-29 year age group.”Gliomas are referred to as ‘aggressive malignant tumours’; the establishmentdefinition of a glioma is,> “any tumour of non-nervous cells (glia) in the nervous system.”The definition also states that the term may be used to refer to all tumours inthe central nervous system. Although a glioma is different from leukaemia, theyare both ‘cancers’ that have developed in different parts of the body. Leukaemiais defined by the medical establishment as,> “any group of malignant diseases in which the bone marrow and any other> blood-forming organs produce increased numbers of certain types of white blood> cells.”As previously cited, the ACS states that the exact cause of leukaemia isunknown, but it is claimed to involve ‘risk factors’ that include ‘certainchemicals’, which, despite vehement denial by the medical establishment, includethe toxic ingredients of vaccines that enter the bloodstream and poison theblood. The link between vaccines and cancer can be demonstrated from twoincontrovertible facts. Firstly, at least two vaccine ingredients, namelymercury and formaldehyde, are known carcinogens. Secondly, despite the assertionthat vaccines are safe, they are not evaluated for their carcinogenicity; a factthat can be ascertained by reference to vaccine package inserts. The pertinentphrase common to all package inserts is that the relevant vaccine,> “…has not been evaluated for carcinogenic, or mutagenic potential, or> potential to impair fertility.”The failure to evaluate the carcinogenic effects of vaccines means that themedical establishment cannot claim there is no association between vaccines andcancer.Furthermore, the age range during which vaccines are administered is closelyfollowed by the age range in which ALL, the most common form of leukaemia,frequently occurs; as reported on the web page entitled Acute LymphoblasticLeukaemia that states,> “There is a peak in incidence in children aged two to three years; more than> half of all children diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia are under> the age of five years.”An association between mercury and leukaemia was also substantiated by Dr HalHuggins, as discussed in chapter six in the example of the child whose leukaemiadisappeared after the removal of her amalgam fillings.Although the medical establishment in general has a poor level of knowledgeabout the processes involved in the development of cancer, some scientists aredeveloping a better understanding of this disease. These scientists include,most notably, Dr David Rasnick and Dr Peter Duesberg who together haveinvestigated the aneuploidy theory of cancer, which states that all cancersdevelop as the result of chromosomal errors.This is not a new theory; it was first introduced by David von Hansemann in 1890and first formally stated by Dr Theodor Boveri in his 1914 book originallypublished in German and subsequently translated into English in 1929. Moreinformation about the development of the theory is available from Dr Rasnick’swebsite.A clear example of problems caused by chromosomal changes is Down’s syndrome;the previous discussion about this condition explained that it is caused by asingle error in the smallest chromosome. Chromosomal errors also occur incancers; however, Dr Rasnick explains the difference between Down’s syndrome andcancer in his previously cited article, in which he states that,> “With Down’s, the defect occurs in the germ line and so the chromosomal error> is present in every cell in the body.”As discussed in the section about Down’s syndrome, cells in the germ line arethose that develop into the reproductive cells, which are the primary cells fromwhich the human body develops.In cancer, however, Dr Rasnick explains that the defect,> “...occurs in a particular cell after the body is formed.”This distinction is extremely important.Drs Rasnick and Duesberg are not the only scientists to have made the connectionbetween aneuploidy and cancer. Although her work mainly focused on exposing thedangers of endocrine disrupting chemicals, Dr Theo Colborn also recognised theexistence of aneuploidy. On the Our Stolen Future website is an article entitledWhat is aneuploidy and why is it important? that explains the correlationbetween aneuploidy and cancer,> “Another type of aneuploidy, ‘mitotic’ aneuploidy, is associated with> virtually all solid tumor cancers.”It is clear therefore, that any disruption to the normal processes of celldivision that produce a ‘defect’ within any of the chromosomes passed to thedaughter cells, will result in aneuploidy. Meiotic aneuploidy produces birthdefects; mitotic aneuploidy produces cancer. It is also clear that any ‘factor’that can cause ‘mitotic’ aneuploidy must be defined as a carcinogen; as DrRasnick states,> “In fact, all carcinogens that have been examined so far do cause aneuploidy.”This does not solely refer to ‘chemical carcinogens’, it also applies to thosereferred to as ‘physical carcinogens’, especially ionising radiation, which hasbeen proven to cause chromosomal damage; in other words, aneuploidy. Ionisingradiation is both teratogenic and carcinogenic, which demonstrates the existenceof a direct and close relationship between aneuploidy, birth defects and cancer.Another factor associated with cancer is a high level of ‘free radicals’, asindicated by the previously cited article entitled Drug-Induced Oxidative Stress& Toxicity that states,> “Tumour cells have high levels of ROS, and studies have shown elevated levels> of oxidative stress and/or oxidative DNA damage in human malignancies relative> to normal cells.”In summary, therefore, the development of cancer involves a combination ofinterrelated factors, which are toxins, oxidative stress, cell damage andchromosomal errors.Although the WHO predicts that the incidence of cancer will continue to rise inthe foreseeable future, it is not inevitable that this dire prediction willbecome reality. The WHO is, however, optimistic about achieving a reducedmortality rate in the claim that,> “Cancer mortality can be reduced if cases are detected and treated early.”This claim is misleading; most forms of cancer have poor survival rates aftertreatment, which means that early detection and treatment does not reduce therisk of mortality or guarantee survival; the main reason for poor survival ratesis due to the nature of the ‘treatments’. The most common forms of ‘treatment’are surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, all of which are based on the erroneoustheory that cancer is a disease that must be fought and ‘killed’.Furthermore, two of the ‘treatments’, namely chemotherapy and radiation, areacknowledged to be carcinogenic, which means they have been proven to causecancer. The basis for their use as a ‘treatment’ is that they are believed to‘target’ and kill cancer cells; the inability of any treatment to ‘target’specific cells, including cancer cells, has been discussed. These treatments arealso claimed to be tailored to the patient so that they receive the right ‘dose’that will kill the cancer but not them; this is another misguided application ofthe Paracelsus fallacy. Unfortunately, these treatments do not solve theproblem, as demonstrated by the large number of people who have not survived,despite being treated for their cancer. Clearly, some people do survive, butthey do so despite the treatment, not because of it.Chemotherapy is carcinogenic, which means that it can cause cancer, as indicatedby the previously cited example in which the NHS claims that many cases of ALLare caused by ‘previous chemotherapy’. Cancer that has been caused bycarcinogenic substances cannot be ‘cured’ through the use of carcinogenicsubstances; these treatments only exacerbate the body burden of toxins, andtherefore contribute to a worsening of the problem or to a ‘return’ of thedisease, usually in a more aggressive form.This highlights another poorly understood aspect of cancer; the ‘return’ of thedisease, or ‘metastasis’ as it is called; the WHO fact sheet explains that,> “One defining feature of cancer is the rapid creation of abnormal cells that> grow beyond their usual boundaries, and which can then invade adjoining parts> of the body and spread to other organs, the latter process is referred to as> metastasizing.”Metastasis frequently occurs in a different organ or site from that of the‘primary’ cancer; it is for this reason that it is also referred to as a‘secondary’ cancer. The medical establishment view of metastasis is that theoriginal cancer was not completely eradicated by the treatment and that thecancer cells have migrated to a new location in the body. However, this cannotbe the case; the idea that cancer cells ‘spread’ to other parts of the body and‘invade’ other organs is erroneous as it completely contradicts cell biology.The establishment definition of a cell includes the statement that,> “Complex organisms are built up of millions of cells that are specially> adapted to carry out particular functions. The process of cell differentiation> begins early on in the development of the embryo and cells of a particular> type (e.g. blood cells, liver cells) always give rise to cells of the same> type.”The flawed establishment understanding about metastasis is recognised, albeit toa limited extent, in a January 2017 article entitled Gene discovery could shedlight on how cancer cells spread, which admits that,> “...the underlying mechanisms that control how cancer cells spread aren’t well> understood.”Cell specialisation means that cells of one organ do not ‘spread’ to anotherorgan.Interestingly, metastasis does not seem to be a ‘natural progression’ of cancerin laboratory animals, as explained by Dr Tony Page in Vivisection Unveiled,> “... artificially carcinogen-challenged laboratory animals do not normally> develop metastases at all.”This is a significant comment that also highlights one of the major problemswith the use of animals in disease research experiments; which is that thedisease under investigation is often induced by artificial methods. This meanstherefore that researchers are unlikely to be studying the same ‘disease’. Thecreation of artificial diseases means that it is not possible to draw meaningfulconclusions for human health from the results of animal experimentation; this isone of the most potent arguments against the use of animals for disease researchstudies.One of the most common sites of a ‘secondary’ cancer is the liver, which, aspreviously discussed, is the body’s major detoxification organ. Liver cancertherefore results from an excess body burden of toxins that the body is losingits ability to process and eliminate; these toxins will include the chemicalsused as chemotherapy ‘medications’. This means that the ‘treatment’ invariablycontributes to metastasis. Unfortunately, a secondary cancer is frequently‘treated’ with further doses of chemotherapy or radiation, or both. Thisadditional toxic onslaught far too frequently results in the death of thepatient, who is then reported as having ‘lost their battle with cancer’. Inreality, the patient has lost their battle against the accumulation of toxins,which include the substances that caused the original cancer, in addition tothose used as ‘treatments’.The recognition that these treatments often fail to save the patient encouragesthe cancer research community to continue the search for the elusive cancercure. Despite the reference to ‘infections’ as causal factors of cancer, thereare new theories that bizarrely contemplate the use of ‘germs’ as potentialcancer ‘treatments’. An October 2015 article entitled Cancer-fighting viruseswin approval was published as a news item on the website of the journal Nature;the article states,> “On 27 October, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a genetically> engineered virus called talimogene laherparepvec (T-Vec) to treat advanced> melanoma.”There are many problems with this approach, not least of which is that itinvolves genetic engineering, a technology that has been shown to be anuncertain, unpredictable and imprecise process that has the potential to beextremely dangerous. The discussion in chapter six indicated that the outcome ofgenetic engineering experiments cannot be controlled; a problem, which, togetherwith the inability to reach the specified ‘target’, raises serious concernsabout these ‘treatments’ that are to be introduced into human bodies.The investigation of ‘viral’ treatments for cancer arose from observations thattumours would occasionally regress when patients had experienced symptoms of an‘infection’, especially a fever. These observations do not prove that virusesare the cause of infections nor do they prove that viral infections can ‘cure’cancer. Furthermore, this approach directly contradicts the claim that‘infections’ are major contributory factors to the development of cancer.The symptoms of an ‘infection’ are indicative of the body’s efforts to detoxifyand eliminate the toxins as waste. The resulting ‘remission’ in cancer followingan ‘infection’ demonstrates a number of important points, which are: that canceris directly related to toxic build up in the body; that detoxification is animportant aspect of recovering from cancer; and that the body is capable ofself-healing.Bacteria are similarly implicated as causal factors of cancer; helicobacterpylori for example, is claimed to be a cause of gastric cancer. Yetinvestigations are also being conducted to determine if bacteria may also havethe potential for use as cancer ‘treatments’. These investigations also involvegenetic engineering methods on the basis that they will be able to express therequired property in the bacteria; there are clearly many problems with thisarea of research.It is abundantly obvious that the medical establishment has not won the ‘war oncancer’. But it was inevitable that they would lose this war, because theapproach they employed is based on flawed theories that consider it appropriateto use carcinogenic treatments to ‘kill’ the disease; an approach that has onlysucceeded in exacerbating the incidence of and mortality from cancer.Unfortunately, the problem is not exclusive to cancer; the medical establishmentpossesses a flawed understanding about the mechanisms involved in all chronicdiseases; as has been demonstrated by this chapter and as will be furtherdiscussed in chapter ten.It is possible to avoid cancer; but to do so requires a completely differentunderstanding of the disease. As this discussion has demonstrated, cancerdevelops mainly as the result of long-term exposures to a variety of toxic, aswell as carcinogenic, substances and influences, most of which are the products,wastes and emissions of a wide variety of industries; as Dr Epstein explains inToxic Beauty,> “...a strong body of scientific evidence demonstrates that, apart from> carcinogenic ingredients in consumer products, the predominant cause of the> modern cancer epidemic is directly related to petrochemical and nuclear> industry technologies and their environmental pollutants.”It should be noted that non-ionising radiation must also be included as acontributory factor to the ‘modern cancer epidemic’.It is imperative that the flawed medical establishment approach to cancer isreplaced by an approach based on a genuine understanding of the disease, inorder to prevent the anticipated continual rise in the incidence of andmortality from this disease.Furthermore, it must be recognised that cancer is not a ‘disease entity’ thatattacks the body; but, instead, is a manifestation of damage within the body.In Natural Hygiene: Man’s Pristine Way of Life, Herbert Shelton provides anexquisitely simple explanation of cancer in the statement that,> “Cancer does not attack. Cancer evolves.”He expands on this by adding,> “Cancer does not develop in a normal body. This is to say, a genuinely healthy> body will not evolve cancer.”The meaning of the phrase ‘genuinely healthy body’ has implications for all‘diseases’; as the discussions in chapter ten will reveal."},{"pageContent":"> 8. Global Issues: The Wider Perspective> “Economic development can proceed without a concomitant decrease in> environmental quality if it is based on an appropriate, ecologically benign> production technology.” Barry Commoner The United Nations (UN) was founded in 1945 at the end of WWII; its Charter wassigned by the representatives of 51 countries that became the first group ofMember States. UN Membership has grown in the post-war years to the extent thatit now includes virtually every country recognised to be a sovereign state. Atthe time of writing, there are 193 UN Member States and 2 Non-Member States withobserver status. The original central mission of the UN is stated on the webpage entitled What We Do to have been,> “...the maintenance of international peace and security.”Although there has not been a world war since 1945, there have been manyconflicts throughout various regions of the world that have involved militarypersonnel from many countries. It cannot, therefore, be claimed that the UN hasbeen entirely successful in maintaining international peace.It is beyond the intended scope of this chapter to discuss war, except toemphasise that its consequences are always detrimental for the overwhelmingmajority of people. In addition to the physical damage it causes, war alsocauses serious damage to the people who survive; it adversely affects both thephysical and mental health of civilian populations as well as participatingtroops.The UN mission, like its membership, has also grown; the web page entitledOverview in the series of pages entitled About the UN, explains its wide-rangingfunctions,> “Due to the powers vested in its Charter and its unique international> character, the United Nations can take action on the issues confronting> humanity in the 21st century, such as peace and security, climate change,> sustainable development, human rights, disarmament, terrorism, humanitarian> and health emergencies, gender equality, governance, food production, and> more.”In addition to the core UN body, the UN system includes many organisations andagencies that are listed on the web page entitled Funds, Programmes, SpecializedAgencies and Others. The group listed under the sub-heading Programmes and Fundsincludes UNDP (United Nations Development Programme), UNICEF (United NationsChildren’s Fund), WFP (World Food Programme), UNFPA (United Nations PopulationFund), UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development) and UNEP(United Nations Environment Programme). The group listed under the sub-headingUN Specialized Agencies, which are described as ‘autonomous organizations thatwork within the UN’, includes the World Bank, IMF (International Monetary Fund),WHO and FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization). The most significantorganisation under the sub-heading Other Entities is UNAIDS (Joint UnitedNations Programme on HIV/AIDS). The group entitled Related Organizationsincludes IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency), WTO (World TradeOrganization), CTBTO (Preparatory Commission for the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organisation) and OPCW (Organization for the Prohibitionof Chemical Weapons).The all-encompassing nature of the UN’s mission statement, together with itsalmost total global membership, means that UN policies issued for the purposesof implementing the ‘actions’ deemed necessary to address the various issuesclaimed to confront humanity, will affect virtually all aspects of life for theentire population of the world.The idea that these issues are ‘global’ is used to justify the implementation of‘global’ solutions that follow a coordinated strategy based on a ‘consensus’about each of these problems. However, problems can only be resolved when theirnature is fully understood and their root causes have been correctly identified;it is for this reason that the UN policies that are intended to resolve theissues that confront humanity, should involve strategies that will address andrectify their root causes. But, as the discussions in this chapter willdemonstrate, a number of these issues are not fully understood and their rootcauses have not been correctly identified. Solutions based on a flawedunderstanding of a problem and its causes will not only fail to resolve it, theywill almost inevitably exacerbate the problem.One of the key aspects of many current UN strategies is ‘development’, which isperceived to be synonymous with ‘civilisation’ and an improved quality of life;the main UN organisations concerned with the issue of ‘development’ are UNDP andUNCTAD. UNDP was established in 1965 from the merger of the United NationsExpanded Programme of Technical Assistance and the United Nations Special Fund.According to the UN web page that describes the various programmes and funds,UNDP works,> “…to eradicate poverty, reduce inequalities and build resilience so countries> can sustain progress.”The page explains the role of UNDP in development policies and strategies,> “As the UN’s development agency, UNDP plays a critical role in helping> countries achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.”UNCTAD was created in 1964 and is described on the UN page as,> “…the United Nations body responsible for dealing with development issues,> particularly international trade – the main driver of development.”The About UNCTAD page on the UNCTAD website states that,> “We support developing countries to access the benefits of a globalized> economy more fairly and effectively.”The problems with the view that ‘globalisation’ is the driving force behinddevelopment and is beneficial to ‘developing’ countries are discussed in anumber of sections within this chapter.The addition of the adjective ‘sustainable’ to the term ‘development’ is claimedto have originated from the 1972 Club of Rome publication entitled Limits toGrowth. Although regarded as only one of the major issues facing humanity in the21st century, ‘sustainable development’ is central to many UN programmes, as itis claimed to be interconnected to virtually all of the other issues that needto be resolved.Countries have all been categorised according to their stage of development andare all referred to as either ‘developed’ or ‘developing’; the latter term wasoriginally created to describe countries that had not achieved‘industrialisation’. In addition, the term ‘least developed country’ (LDC) wascreated in the 1960s as a means of identifying countries that were regarded as‘in most need’. The term LDC remains in use; in 2017, according to the UNwebsite, 47 countries were listed as LDCs. Countries are also categorisedaccording to their ‘income’, which refers specifically to GNI (Gross NationalIncome) per capita. This classification system, produced each year by the WorldBank, contains four categories; low, lower-middle, upper-middle and high.The failure of a country to achieve an adequate level of ‘development’ isgenerally perceived to be the result of its ‘primitive’ nature; but this is amistaken perception, as Barry Commoner explains in Making Peace With the Planet,> “Their characteristic condition – large and rapidly growing populations;> grinding poverty; desperate efforts for economic development, now hampered by> huge debts – is not the outcome of a ‘primitive’ past.”A key characteristic of countries referred to as ‘developing’ or ‘leastdeveloped’ is that many of them are former colonies of European countries; as DrCommoner also explains,> “...a fact about developing countries that is often forgotten: they once were,> and in the economic sense often still remain, colonies of more developed> countries.”One of the main activities of colonising countries involved the appropriation ofthe resources of the colonised country; these resources were then utilised ortraded, or both, for the benefit of the colonisers. In many instances, theseresources, or the profits from trading them, were transferred out of theircountry of origin, which not only depleted the resources of the colonisedcountries, it also impoverished the indigenous population. A number of‘developed’ countries have achieved their advanced level of development, in partat least, as the result of the resources of their former colonies.One of the many examples of such an exploitation of resources is the conquest of‘America’ by Europeans, especially the Spanish, Portuguese and British, asdiscussed in chapter four. The plunder of valuable materials, especially goldand silver, and their removal to European countries, as well as the brutaltreatment of the native population, substantially depleted the resources andpeoples of these regions, many of which remain ‘economic colonies’ of developedcountries, as described by Dr Commoner.Another example is the plunder of India’s resources by the British; initially bythe East India Company (EIC) and later by the British establishment when Indiabecame part of the British Empire. It is widely recognised that, prior to thearrival of the EIC, India had a variety of thriving industries, all of whichwere substantially diminished, if not totally destroyed during the colonialperiod. The wealth of the EIC and the British establishment was gained at theexpense of the Indian people.The colonisation of a number of African countries during the ‘Scramble’ of the19th century, mainly by Britain, France, Germany and Belgium, provides furtherexamples of the exploitation of resources for the benefit of colonisingcountries at the expense of the native populations. The plunder of many Africancountries had, however, begun a few centuries prior to the 19th century whenAfrican people had been enslaved. Although colonisation cannot be held solelyresponsible for the current difficulties of most African countries, it iscertainly a significant contributory factor; the majority of countriescategorised by the World Bank as ‘low-income’ are within Africa and many of themare former colonies of European countries.These are by no means the only examples of plunder and exploitation of acountry’s resources for the economic benefit of another country, but they aresufficient to illustrate that a lack of development in former colony countriescannot be attributed to their ‘primitive’ past or people. The ‘failure’ todevelop owes its origin, to a certain extent at least, to the rapacious andacquisitive nature of small groups of people who perceive it to be perfectlyacceptable to seize power, in order to gain control over the resources ofanother country and to also make immense personal fortunes in the process.It is important to emphasise that this exploitation of resources by small groupsof people has not ceased; it remains an ongoing process although in a differentguise, as the discussions in this chapter as well as chapter nine willdemonstrate.Regardless of their stage of ‘development’, all UN Member States have agreed tothe implementation of the UN ‘sustainable development’ agenda. This agenda beganin 1992 with Agenda 21, was followed in 2000 by the Millennium Development Goals(MDGs) and in 2015 by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), all of which arebriefly outlined below.Agenda 21The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) was held inJune 1992 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The main outcome of this conference, alsoknown as the Earth Summit, was ‘Agenda 21’, which, according to the UN web pageentitled Agenda 21,> “…is a comprehensive plan of action to be taken globally, nationally and> locally by organizations of the United Nations system, Governments and Major> Groups in every area in which human impacts on the environment.”The Preamble to the Agenda 21 document, available from the UN website, beginswith the profound statement that,> “Humanity stands at a defining moment in history. We are confronted with a> perpetuation of disparities between and within nations, a worsening of> poverty, hunger, ill health and illiteracy, and the continuing deterioration> of the ecosystems on which we depend for our well-being.”This is immediately followed by an overview of the measures claimed to benecessary to address this dire situation in the statement that,> “However, integration of environment and development concerns and greater> attention to them will lead to the fulfilment of basic needs, improved living> standards for all, better protected and managed ecosystems and a safer, more> prosperous future. No nation can achieve this on its own; but together we can> - in a global partnership for sustainable development.”The desire to improve the living standards for everyone is indeed a noble andworthwhile goal; but whatever measures have been implemented under Agenda 21since 1992, they have largely failed. Living standards have improved for a few,but not for the overwhelming majority of people who still suffer from poverty,hunger and ill health. The disparities within nations between the ‘rich’ and the‘poor’ have not been addressed by Agenda 21; instead, there is an ever-wideningwealth gap in virtually every country. The number of extremely wealthy peoplehas grown to the extent that, according to reports, there are more than 2million millionaires and in excess of 2,000 billionaires in the world. But, incontrast to this wealth, is the more than 1 billion people who are reported tolive not just in poverty, but in extreme poverty.The 351 pages of Agenda 21 detail the many diverse areas that are perceived torequire attention in order to achieve the UN’s ‘developmental and environmental’objectives. Of particular importance to health is chapter 6, which is entitledProtecting and Promoting Human Health and begins with the statement that,> “Health and development are intimately interconnected.”The chapter discusses a number of activities that relate to health matters andrefers to the WHO as the appropriate international organisation to coordinateall health-related aspects of the agenda. Two of the programme areas listed asrequiring attention are ‘control of communicable diseases’ and ‘reducing healthrisks from environmental pollution and hazards’. The section entitled Control ofcommunicable diseases makes the familiar but erroneous claim that,> “Advances in the development of vaccines and chemotherapeutic agents have> brought many communicable diseases under control.”The rigid adherence to the ‘germ theory’ is one of the medical establishment’smajor flaws. The retention of the belief in ‘pathogenic microorganisms’ has notonly prevented an understanding of the true nature of disease, it has alsoprevented the identification of the real causes of disease. The failure tounderstand diseases and their root causes has inevitably led to the use oftotally inappropriate measures to address them.Interestingly, the section entitled Reducing health risks from environmentalpollution and hazards recognises that environmental pollution and health arerelated to development in the statement that,> “The overall objective is to minimize hazards and maintain the environment to> a degree that human health and safety is not impaired or endangered and yet> encourage development to proceed.”This dilemma is common to a wide variety of issues, including the use of toxicsubstances to kill ‘pathogens’ as well as the many vectors claimed to carry‘pathogens’; vector-borne diseases are discussed later in this chapter.Human health hazards and environmental degradation are not inevitableconsequences of ‘development’, as indicated by Barry Commoner’s quote that opensthis chapter. These hazards only exist as the result of ‘development’ that hasentailed the use of toxic substances and hazardous technologies and beenaccompanied by a blatant disregard for the environmental and health consequencesof their use and disposal.Although other plans have been introduced since 1992, they are not entirely newones as they all effectively expand upon and extend the ‘comprehensive plan ofaction’ of Agenda 21.Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)The next phase of the ‘development agenda’ was introduced in September 2000 whenthe Millennium Declaration was signed and the Millennium Development Goals(MDGs) were adopted. The eight goals and their related targets were intended tospecifically address some of the key issues of the 21st century and to beachieved over the course of a 15-year period.The UN web page about the Millennium Development Goals refers to these goals as,> “…a blueprint agreed to by all the world’s countries and all the world’s> leading development institutions.”However, although agreed to by all UN Member States, this ‘blueprint’ wasintended for implementation only in ‘developing’ countries. Under the headingValues and Principles, the Millennium Declaration claims that,> “We recognize that developing countries and countries with economies in> transition face special difficulties in responding to this central challenge.”The ‘central challenge’ referred to was,> “…to ensure that globalization becomes a positive force for all the world’s> people.”It would seem that the UN clearly does not acknowledge that many ‘developing’countries may not have faced such a daunting challenge had a significant volumeof their resources not been appropriated by colonising countries.The failure of Agenda 21 to resolve the problem of poverty, especially in‘developing’ countries, is demonstrated by the first of the MDGs, which aimed to‘eradicate extreme poverty and hunger’. Of the eight MDGs, three relate tohealth matters; these are: MDG 4 that aimed to ‘reduce child mortality’; MDG 5to ‘improve maternal health’; and MDG 6 to ‘combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and otherdiseases’. It is clear however, that these goals were not achieved; theseproblems are claimed to persist in many countries and efforts to address themcontinue to feature in the agenda.Despite this lack of success, the Millennium Development Goals 2015 Reportnevertheless claims that, at the expiration of the MDGs, there are reasons tocelebrate because,> “Thanks to concerted global, regional, national and local efforts, the MDGs> have saved the lives of millions and improved conditions for many more.”This claim cannot be substantiated; one of the key problems highlighted in thereport, and acknowledged to require attention, is the continuing lack ofadequate data, which clearly raises serious questions about the veracity of thestatistics quoted in the report as ‘evidence’ of the successes and achievementsof the MDGs.Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)In September 2015, UN Member States agreed to the next phase of the developmentagenda; they announced a new Declaration and produced a document entitledTransforming our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Thisdocument describes the 17 SDGs and 169 targets of this plan, which will bereferred to as the 2030 Agenda. As the title indicates, these goals are to beachieved by the year 2030; however, unlike the MDGs, the SDGs are to beimplemented by all UN Member States, not just ‘developing’ countries. It is forthis reason that everyone needs to be aware of the measures that are to beintroduced for the attainment of the 2030 Agenda goals. The Preamble to theTransforming our World document states that the SDGs,> “…seek to build on the Millennium Development Goals and complete what these> did not achieve.”The allocation of a mere 15 years for the achievement of 17 goals is certainlyambitious, considering the little that was achieved under the previous plan thatonly contained 8 goals. Nevertheless, the effort to accomplish these goals is tobe intensified, as indicated by the Introduction to the document that states,> “We commit ourselves to working tirelessly for the full implementation of this> Agenda by 2030.”Under the sub-heading Our Vision is the statement that,> “In these Goals and targets, we are setting out a supremely ambitious and> transformational vision. We envisage a world free of poverty, hunger, disease> and want, where all life can thrive.”This noble-sounding ‘vision’ certainly recognises some of the fundamental issuesthat the overwhelming majority of people around the world face on a daily basis.But the key to the success, or otherwise, of this vision is totally dependent onthe measures introduced to address those issues; these goals and targets canonly be achieved if the proposed measures are able to address the real rootcauses of the problems to be solved.Unfortunately, it is unlikely that the world will be freed from ‘poverty,hunger, disease and want’ by the UN, WHO and other global institutions, becausethey do not understand the nature and causes of the problems they purport tosolve. The reasons for this situation are complex, but are mostly due to theinfluence exerted by a relatively small group of vested interests, as will bedemonstrated in this and the next chapter.The problems that confront humanity can be resolved, but to do so requires acompletely different approach; one that does not rely on global organisations.It is beyond the intended scope of this chapter to discuss the entire 2030Agenda. It is, however, necessary to examine a number of goals that have anindirect impact on health as well as those that directly relate to health, inorder to demonstrate why these goals cannot be achieved. It should be noted thatsome of the discussions refer to subjects that have previously been discussed,but are re-examined in this chapter with reference to the wider perspective ofthe ‘global agenda’.Good Health and Well-BeingThe core aim of Goal 3 of the 2030 Agenda is to,> “Ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages.”This Goal contains 13 targets, each of which pertains to a specific issue deemednecessary to be addressed for the attainment of the overall objective of ‘healthfor all’.The UN web page that refers to specialised agencies, describes the WHO as,> “…the directing and coordinating authority on international health within the> United Nations system.”The About WHO page on the WHO website states that,> “We are building a better, healthier future for people all over the world.”As previously cited, the WHO defines health as,> “…a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely> the absence of disease or infirmity.”It may be assumed from all of the above statements, that the WHO has theconcomitant knowledge and competence to ensure that the proposed measures willbe able to achieve all of the targets of Goal 3 of the 2030 Agenda. This wouldhowever, be a mistaken assumption.As previous discussions have shown, the medical establishment, of which the WHOis the leading ‘authority’, has, and even admits to having, a poor understandingabout chronic diseases, including their causes. Previous discussions have alsoshown that the medical establishment is mistaken in their belief in ‘germs’ asthe causes of many other diseases. Furthermore, the measures employed are unableto improve health; they cannot ‘ensure healthy lives’; nor can they facilitate a‘healthier future’ for people.One of the main reasons these measures cannot succeed is because they rely on anapproach that almost exclusively employs pharmaceutical medicines and vaccinesto treat and prevent disease; but these products are unable to deliver ‘health’.The lack of efficacy of this approach is demonstrated by the increasingincidence of and mortality from disease. More disturbingly, the WHO anticipatesthat disease morbidity and mortality will continue to rise into the foreseeablefuture.It may also be assumed that the goal of ‘health for all’ is intended to be forthe benefit of all; but this too is a mistaken assumption. The underlyingpurpose of this goal is based on the idea that health and development areinterconnected; that the population of a country needs to be healthy to enable‘development’ to proceed. The people are therefore viewed purely in terms oftheir economic usefulness to the country, as indicated by the WHO web pageentitled Health and development that states,> “…healthy populations live longer, are more productive, and save more.”This statement suggests that, by extension, unhealthy people are lessproductive, or even unproductive if they are unable to work at all; and thatthis means they are not only less able to contribute to the country’s economybut a financial burden to the country when they require healthcare services. Theexistence of a significant number of unhealthy people within the population istherefore considered to be an impediment to a country’s development and economicgrowth. This notion is, however, based on a number of assumptions, most notablythe assumption that the main purpose of life is solely to contribute to theeconomy of the country in which a person lives; this is however, a seriouslyflawed assumption.Another similarly flawed assumption is that ‘health’ can only be delivered by‘healthcare systems’ that include the provision of pharmaceutical medicines andvaccines, which are promoted as essential as well as safe and effective; asindicated by target 8 of SDG 3 that states the aim to,> “Achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection,> access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe,> effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all.”It is claimed that the provision of ‘healthcare services’ imposes a financialburden on the economy of a country and that the high cost of healthcare imposesa financial burden on individuals. These financial burdens are claimed to beaddressed by universal health coverage; as indicated by the January 2019 WHOfact sheet entitled Universal health coverage that states,> “UHC means that all individuals and communities receive the health services> they need without suffering financial hardship.”The reason for the inclusion of financial risk protection as a core feature ofUHC is that it will enable people to afford the cost of healthcare services whenthey need them, without precipitating them into poverty or extreme poverty.However, most forms of financial risk protection, through insurance or taxationfor example, entail ongoing costs that may still be beyond the means of asignificant proportion of the world population; especially the billion or morepeople who live in extreme poverty. The fact sheet claims the reason foruniversal health coverage is because,> “At least half of the world’s population still do not have full coverage of> essential health services.”It is claimed that people in ‘poor’ countries lack the resources and facilitiesthat are available to people in ‘rich’ countries, and this encourages the notionthat the former should be assisted financially by the latter through ‘aid’; asindicated by the WHO web page entitled Aid for health that states,> “A key goal of many development agencies, including WHO, is to increase the> amount of aid provided by rich countries to poor countries.”The purpose of ‘aid’ is to provide financial assistance, not only for thecreation of facilities, such as hospitals and clinics, but also for the purchaseof ‘essential medicines and vaccines’. The idea that these ‘healthcare services’will have a direct and beneficial impact on the health of the people in poorcountries is fatally flawed; better access to ‘healthcare services’ does notcorrelate with better health.The point to be emphasised is that the health of an individual person bears norelationship whatsoever to the state of the economy of the country in which theylive. An illustrative example is America, which is classified as a ‘rich’country yet millions of Americans suffer poor health despite the huge sums ofmoney spent on healthcare services. Health is not a direct and inevitableconsequence of wealth, nor is ill-health an inevitable consequence of poverty.Although poverty and ill-health are related, it is a complex relationship, aswill be discussed later in this chapter.In addition to physical structures such as hospitals, ‘health care’ alsorequires sufficient numbers of people who are suitably qualified and capable ofproviding and administering all of the appropriate services; this requirement ishighlighted by SDG 3.7 that aims to,> “Substantially increase health financing and the recruitment, development,> training and retention of the health workforce in developing countries.”Most people who join the ‘health workforce’ do so because they want to helpothers. However, no matter how well-meaning they are, these health workers willinvariably have been educated within the medical establishment system. They willtherefore believe in and perpetuate flawed theories, especially with respect tothe use of medicines and vaccines in the treatment and prevention of disease.Unfortunately, the 2030 Agenda proposes to commit even greater levels of fundingto the development of new pharmaceutical products, as demonstrated by SDG 3bthat states the aim to,> “Support the research and development of vaccines and medicines for the> communicable and non-communicable diseases that primarily affect developing> countries...”This target clearly intends to ensure that ‘medicines and vaccines’ remain keycomponents of the ‘healthcare services’ deemed essential for everyone,everywhere, but especially for people in ‘developing’ countries.Medicines for allThe medical establishment claims that ‘medicines’ are a key component of‘healthcare’; that they are not only appropriate in the treatment of disease,but that they are the only means by which diseases can and should be treated.This claim is, however unfounded. Although the problems with ‘medicine’ havebeen discussed in chapter one, they require further examination in the contextof the 2030 Agenda.The chemicals required by the human body to support the biochemical processesthat sustain life, need to be the ‘right’ chemicals and in the ‘right’ form tobe utilised by those processes; chemicals that are not the right ones or are notin the right form cannot be utilised by the body’s processes and thereforecannot promote health or sustain life.Pharmaceutical ‘medicines’ are not employed for the purpose of providing supportto the body’s biochemical processes. Instead, they are synthetic compoundsproduced within the laboratories of the chemical industry for the sole purposeof interfering with certain bodily functions that are believed to be involved indisease processes. But, as previously discussed, any substance that interfereswith the body’s normal functioning is, by definition, a poison.It is indisputable that pharmaceutical ‘medicines’ produce effects, it is theirintended purpose to produce an ‘effect’ on the processes of disease. They arealso recognised to produce unintended or unexpected effects, which are referredto as merely ‘side effects’; but, as has been discussed, this label is amisnomer. The effects produced by medicines are always detrimental, as can bedemonstrated by a perusal of the list of possible ‘side effects’ with which theymay be associated. Although medicines are claimed to produce beneficial effects,this is illusory; as will be discussed in chapter ten.The failure to fully investigate and understand the functions of the human bodymeans that the medical establishment also fails to appreciate the detrimentaleffects that result from the use of pharmaceuticals. The onset of new symptoms,in addition to those for which a ‘medicine’ has been prescribed, is generallyregarded as a new condition or disease that requires ‘treatment’ with yetanother ‘medicine’. The discussion in chapter one referred to reports about theincidence of iatrogenesis in the US where healthcare is the most expensive inthe world, yet many thousands of people are harmed and die every year due to‘medicines’ administered correctly; in other words, medicines have been shownnot to be safe or effective in one of the richest countries in the world.Although most studies have investigated the extent of the problem in the US,iatrogenesis is not exclusive to that country; it also occurs in Europe, asindicated by Professor Donald W Light PhD, who states in his 2014 articleentitled The Epidemic of Sickness and Death from Prescription Drugs that,> “About 330,000 patients die each year from prescription drugs in the United> States and Europe.”Although death is clearly the most extreme outcome, it is not the only one;there are many adverse effects of differing intensity that can be attributed to‘medicines’ and they affect a huge number of people’; as indicated by thearticle that refers to,> “…about 80 million medically minor problems such as pains, discomforts and> dysfunctions…”These ‘minor’ problems will be regarded merely as ‘side effects’ that are likelyto be regarded as symptoms that can be treated with other medicines. The use ofmore than one ‘medicine’, whether prescription or over-the-counter, is referredto as polypharmacy, which is another increasingly common phenomenon, aspreviously discussed. Although ‘medicines’ are claimed to have been subjected torigorous safety testing, many have been withdrawn from the market when they havebeen found to produce serious adverse effects that were not discovered prior totheir release onto the market. This clearly raises questions about the claimsthat they had been proven to be safe.Certain drug combinations have been tested to determine their effects, however,very few have been tested in all of the possible combinations that may be usedby patients, especially as increasing numbers of people suffer multimorbidity.The drug interactions that are known may be included on the package insert orthe information may be provided by the prescribing physician. There are however,many thousands of pharmaceuticals on the market, including those availableover-the-counter, which means that there are innumerable combinations, theoverwhelming majority of which are entirely untested.The pharmaceutical industry claims that the development of a new ‘medicine’takes many years. However, the study on which FDA approval of a new drug isbased may be conducted over a relatively short period of time and may onlyinvolve a relatively small population size; as indicated by a May 2017 articleentitled Postmarket Safety Events Among Novel Therapeutics Approved by the USFood and Drug Administration Between 2001 and 2010 that states,> “The majority of pivotal trials that form the basis for FDA approval enrol> fewer than 1000 patients with follow-up of 6 months or less, which may make it> challenging to identify uncommon or long-term serious safety risks.”The use of the word ‘may’ to describe the challenge of identifying the risks isdisingenuous; a short-term study by definition cannot identify adverse effectsthat will occur from long-term use of any pharmaceutical product. Furthermore,most adverse effects caused by pharmaceuticals are identified in thepost-marketing period from epidemiological studies or adverse event reports; inother words, the full range of ‘iatrogenic’ effects are only identified afterthe ‘medicines’ have been introduced into the market and taken by large numbersof people.The failure of the medical establishment to acknowledge that pharmaceuticaldrugs always produce effects that are not merely ‘side effects’, means thatphysicians are not taught to recognise that a patient’s new symptoms are almostcertain to be the result of their ‘medicine’. Although adverse health effectsare often notified to an appropriate regulatory agency, notification systems aremostly voluntary and far from comprehensive. However, even when an adversehealth event is recognised to have been caused by a pharmaceutical ‘medicine’,this does not automatically result in its removal from the market. The May 2017article referred to above discusses the problem and states that,> “Among 222 novel therapeutics approved by the FDA from 2001 through 2010, 71> (32.0%) were affected by a post-market safety event.”But these ‘safety events’ resulted in only 3 product withdrawals. Interestingly,the pharmaceuticals most affected by a ‘post-market safety event’ are reportedto have included biologics and psychiatric therapeutics. As discussed in chapterseven, biologics are described as medications genetically engineered from aliving organism. This is not the only study to have discovered the existence ofadverse health effects; a December 2015 article entitled FDA Safety Reviews onDrugs, Biologics and Vaccines: 2007-2013 found that,> “There were 6930 serious adverse event reports in 181 reviews.”The process of monitoring these ‘events’ is stated to facilitate,> “…detection of safety concerns that may not be identified in prelicensure> clinical trials.”It is abundantly clear therefore, that ‘medicines’ are not fully tested for allpotential adverse health effects during the clinical trials conducted prior totheir release onto the market; yet all pharmaceuticals that have been approvedby the FDA are claimed to be both safe and effective.In the drive to provide ‘medicines for all’, the pharmaceutical industrycontinues to develop an ever-increasing number of products that are claimed totreat a variety of diseases. The PhRMA web page entitled Medicines inDevelopment claims that,> “Since 2000, more than 500 new medicines have been approved by the FDA,> helping patients live longer, healthier lives.”This claim fails to recognise that many ‘medicines’ have been removed from themarket due to their harmful effects; it also fails to recognise the existence of‘iatrogenesis’.The page also contains links to various reports about ‘medicines’ that are beingstudied or developed by various American biopharmaceutical research companies.The web page entitled Medicines in Development for Biologics 2013 Report claimsthat 907 medicines and vaccines are in development for biologics that ‘target’more than 100 diseases. The PhRMA fact sheet about biologics refers to them as‘large molecule medicines’ that are,> “Made by or from living cells and structurally complex…”The processes by which biologics are derived from living organisms are claimedto involve the production of a ‘recombinant protein in living cells’, whichindicates that they create novel protein structures that do not exist in nature.This means that biologics are not compatible with the body and will nottherefore support the biochemical processes that support health and sustainlife, even though they are made from ‘normal’ components of the body. The factsheet states that,> “Their active ingredients are mainly proteins, such as hormones, antibodies,> cytokines, and insulin.”Proteins are essential to sustain life; they are involved in virtually everyfunction within the human body, but they too are incompletely understood by themedical establishment. The fact sheet also makes the important comment thatbiologics,> “…can never be exactly reproduced or copied like generics.”The significance of this point is discussed later in this section.The PhRMA page entitled Medicines in Development for Rare Diseases 2016 Reportreports that,> “…30 million Americans, or 10 percent of the population, have one of the 7,000> known rare diseases…”In this context, ‘rare’ means that fewer than 200,000 Americans suffer from thedisease in question. As has been discussed, polypharmacy is common in the US,which, if ‘medicines’ truly worked, ought to mean that Americans would be someof the healthiest people; yet, as the above indicates, many Americans are farfrom healthy.As new diseases continue to be discovered, the pharmaceutical industry continuesto not only develop new medicines, but to also develop new types of medicine,such as biologics. The creation of new medicines often involves a method called‘high-throughput screening’, which utilises highly sophisticated and expensivetechnology and equipment, including robotics. This method enables a huge numberof tests to be conducted at a very rapid rate, which is claimed to facilitate amuch quicker identification of an active compound that has a positive effect ona particular ‘biomolecular pathway’.The pharmaceutical industry claims that most investigations do not lead to thedevelopment of a new medicine and that this low ‘success rate’, together withthe high costs of the technology and the long development period of each newmedicine, justify the high cost of the medicines that do reach the market. Theindustry also claims that high prices of successful medicines are necessary toensure the ongoing innovation and drug development essential to the viability ofthe industry. It should be noted however, that the pharmaceutical industry is anextremely profitable one. In addition to the development and sale of products,the largest pharmaceutical companies maintain their profitability throughpatents and intellectual property rights, which are discussed in chapter nine;but it should be noted that they both impose restrictions on otherpharmaceutical manufacturers, especially those in ’developing’ countries thatmostly manufacture generic drugs.There are various debates about the best way to solve the problem of inadequateaccess to affordable medicines for people who live in ‘developing’ countries.One solution to the dual problem of inadequate access and high prices has beenfor ‘developing’ countries to establish their own pharmaceutical industry. Thisis perceived to be beneficial for a number of reasons that include: the creationof employment opportunities; economic growth and development; and increasedaccess to affordable medicines claimed to be essential for diseases thatprimarily affect ‘developing’ countries.The creation of a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility requires a huge initialoutlay to cover the costs of the manufacturing plant, laboratory equipment andappropriately qualified staff, amongst others; these costs are said to beprohibitive for most ‘developing’ countries. These difficulties are, however,not insurmountable; many countries categorised as ‘developing’ have anestablished pharmaceutical industry. One prominent example is India, which haddeveloped a pharmaceutical manufacturing industry in the early 20th century longbefore the World Bank classified the country as ‘developing’. The pharmaceuticalindustry in India manufactures mostly generic drugs that are not subject topatents and are therefore more reasonably priced, which makes them moreaffordable, although not for those who live in extreme poverty, a conditionendured by many millions of Indian people.Another Asian country that has pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities isBangladesh, which is currently categorised as a ‘least developed country’, butis reported to be undergoing rapid economic growth that may precipitate a changeof status out of this category in the near future. The Bangladeshipharmaceutical industry will not, however, help to improve the health of theBangladeshi people, even if they were able to afford the medicines produced bythem.A number of companies in African countries have also been able to overcome thedifficulties and establish pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities; asdemonstrated by an October 2014 article entitled Boosting drugs manufacture indeveloping countries will improve health outcomes, UN investment forum told thatstates,> “According to UNCTAD data, South Africa has about 79 pharmaceutical factories,> Nigeria 75, Ghana 23, Kenya 17 and Uganda 10 factories.”Despite the fact that industrialisation is regarded as a key component of‘development’ and that pharmaceutical manufacturing is a profitable industry,these countries all continue to retain the status of ‘developing’ countries.The increased development of biologics, which the PhRMA fact sheet claims cannotbe exactly reproduced like generics, will have a significant impact onpharmaceutical manufacturing in ‘developing’ countries as they will not be ableto produce these new types of medicine. This, in turn, will reduce access to‘essential medicines’ for the poor people in those countries; which is clearlyinconsistent with the goal of the 2030 Agenda to increase access to affordablemedicines for people in ‘developing’ countries.This does not mean that ‘developing’ countries should continue to produceaffordable medicines, because pharmaceuticals are not only ineffective, they arealso harmful. They do not facilitate good health; instead they contribute toill-health.A problem of significant concern for ‘developing’ countries is thatpharmaceutical manufacturing utilises toxic raw materials and produces toxiceffluent. The NRDC report entitled Dosed Without Prescription, cited in chaptersix, explains that, despite the existence of stringent environmental regulationsin ‘developed’ countries, pharmaceutical production facilities neverthelessdischarge their toxic effluent into local bodies of water, such as rivers. Thediscussion in chapter six revealed that the high level of consumption ofpharmaceuticals in ‘developed’ countries generates high concentrations ofpharmaceutical metabolites and by-products in sewage wastes. The NRDC report inparticular, revealed that no available technologies are capable of detoxifyingwater supplies from the toxic wastes of the pharmaceutical industry.The problem of water pollution due to pharmaceutical industry effluent will beintensified in countries that lack the ability to prevent the contamination oflocal bodies of fresh water and lack adequate sanitation facilities. Theincreased use of medicines will increase the contamination of water, especiallybodies of water used by the local population for drinking, which will inevitablyexacerbate health problems, not solve them.It is argued by many people that the ‘poor people’ of the world ought to beallowed to have easy access to affordable ‘medicines’; they also argue that highprices are the major obstacle and that the ‘greedy’ pharmaceutical companies aremainly to blame for this situation. Although these arguments may seemreasonable, they do not focus on the real issues. All arguments that focussolely on the cost and accessibility of ‘medicines’ fail to acknowledge thatthere is a fundamental problem with ‘medicines’; that they do not resolve healthproblems because they are neither safe nor effective; a problem that appliesequally to vaccines, the other component of SDG 3.8.Vaccines for allThe WHO page entitled 10 Facts on Immunization claims that,> “Immunization prevents between 2-3 million deaths every year.”The July 2018 WHO fact sheet entitled Immunization coverage claims that,> “An additional 1.5 million deaths could be avoided, however, if global> vaccination coverage improves.”Although bold, these claims cannot be substantiated; they do however, supportthe aim of the 2030 Agenda to expand vaccination coverage and achieve theultimate goal of ‘vaccines for all’. The main efforts are focused on increasingvaccination coverage in ‘developing’ countries where ‘infectious diseases’ areclaimed to be more prevalent and the people, especially children, are urgentlyin need of ‘life-saving vaccines’.It is claimed that an association exists between a country’s stage ofdevelopment and the type of diseases experienced by its population; as indicatedby the 2009 WHO Global Health Risks report that states,> “As a country develops, the types of diseases that affect a population shift> from primarily infectious, such as diarrhoea and pneumonia, to primarily> non-communicable, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer.”The logical conclusion from this statement is that highly ‘developed’ countriesought to experience an extremely low level of ‘infectious diseases’, if at all;but this clearly is not the case, as revealed by a UK Government paper entitledUK Trends in Infectious Diseases that states,> “Infectious diseases are a significant health and economic burden in the UK…”The UK is categorised as a highly developed country, which means that it shouldnot experience infectious diseases as a significant health problem.Although there is no explanation for the existence of a relationship between‘infectious diseases’ and a low stage of development in a country, the GlobalHealth Risks report claims that the ‘shift’ away from infectious diseases is theresult of three factors, one of which refers to ‘public health interventions’that include vaccination programmes. One of the reasons these interventions areclaimed to be related to ‘development’ is because their costs require a countryto have a sufficient level of ‘income’ to afford them, but ‘developing’countries are said to be unable to meet these costs. This is, however,unfounded; as can be demonstrated by the example of India, where vaccinationprogrammes, have existed since the beginning of the 19th century; yet India was,and still is, categorised as a ‘developing’ country and currently has a‘lower-middle’ income status.One of the many organisations that promote the 2030 Agenda goal to increaseaccess to affordable vaccines in order to save lives, especially for people in‘developing’ countries, is GAVI (Global Alliance for Vaccines andImmunizations), now referred to as the Gavi Alliance, which is described on theweb page entitled About GAVI as,> “…a global Vaccine Alliance, bringing together public and private sectors with> the shared goal of creating equal access to new and underused vaccines for> children living in the world’s poorest countries.”The Gavi Alliance includes the WHO, UNICEF and the World Bank.African countries, especially those in the sub-Saharan region of the continent,are particular targets for increased vaccine coverage; as demonstrated by a 2015article entitled WHO strives to provide universal access to immunization in theAfrican Region by 2020, which states the aim to,> “...ensure that every child in the African Region has access to life-saving> vaccines.”The article also claims that,> “It is estimated that over three million children under five years of age die> each year in the Region and a significant number of these deaths could be> prevented by vaccines.”As previously discussed, vaccines do not prevent death; they have however, beenproven to be dangerous for babies and small children whose health has beencompromised by the unhealthy conditions in which they live. This has beendemonstrated by physicians who have worked in parts of the world where peoplelive in such conditions. In a 1995 interview, Dr Archie Kalokerinos MD, whoworked with the Aboriginal people and children of Australia, stated that,> “You cannot immunise sick children, malnourished children, and expect to get> away with it.”It would seem that the medical establishment does expect to ‘get away with it’;as demonstrated by the drive to increase vaccination coverage in ‘developing’countries where millions of sick and malnourished children live. The healthproblems that are often considered to be indicative of ‘infectious diseases’,but are in fact associated with and often the direct result of poor livingconditions, are not exclusive to ‘developing’ countries; they are increasinglycommon within the urban slums of ‘developed’ countries.Surprisingly, the medical establishment promulgates conflicting advice aboutwhether children who are unwell should be vaccinated. The UK NHS web pageentitled Myths about children’s vaccines states as a ‘fact’ that,> “…you should postpone your child’s jab if they are ill and have a fever (high> temperature).”By contrast, the US CDC web page entitled Vaccines when your child is sickrefers to the recommendation that,> “…children with mild illness can usually receive their vaccinations on> schedule.”‘Mild illness’ is described as including a ‘low grade fever’.In addition to the claim that ‘infectious diseases’ are associated with a lowstage of development, is the idea that they are associated with poverty; asindicated by a 2012 report entitled Global Report for Research on InfectiousDiseases of Poverty, which was prepared by the TDR (Special Programme forResearch and Training in Tropical Diseases) in association with the WHO. Thisreport, which will be referred to as the Infectious Diseases of Poverty report,makes the interesting and significant claim that,> “Infectious diseases of poverty are not restricted to low and middle-income> countries, but manifest in poor populations globally.”The report states that almost 9 million people, including many children underthe age of five, are killed by these diseases each year. In addition, the reportstates that more research is needed on the basis of the claim that,> “Stepping up research into their causes and how to effectively treat them and> prevent them from spreading could have an enormous impact on efforts to lift> people out of poverty and to build a better world for future generations.”Although the report recognises that certain diseases are associated with ‘poorliving conditions’, it makes the erroneous claim that this association occursbecause ‘germs’ thrive in such conditions and that the proliferation of these‘germs’ enables them to spread throughout the population. The efforts to preventthese diseases will inevitably include vaccination programmes.It should be noted that the ‘germs’ alleged to be the causes of the diseasesprevalent in ‘developing’ countries include various bacteria, many of which havebeen found within the bodies of healthy people. For example, respiratoryinfections, especially pneumonia, are claimed to be a significant health problemfor children in ‘developing’ countries. One of the main ‘pathogens’ claimed tobe responsible for pneumonia is Streptococcus pneumoniae, a bacterium that isadmitted to be found in healthy children and therefore cannot be the cause ofpneumonia. Nevertheless, a March 2015 joint press release by the WHO, GAVI,UNICEF and GPEI (Global Polio Eradication Initiative) entitled Children inBangladesh to benefit from dual vaccine introduction states that,> “Pneumonia is one of the leading causes of child mortality in Bangladesh...”This claim cannot be substantiated because autopsies are not a common practicein Bangladesh; furthermore, according to a 2001 article entitled Causes ofchildhood deaths in Bangladesh: an update,> “...very few deaths are attended by a qualified physician.”The article states that the causes of death in Bangladesh are ascertained from‘verbal autopsy reviews’ that provide information about the symptoms suffered bythe child prior to death. But these ‘reviews’ cannot substantiate the claim thatthe disease had been caused by the relevant bacterium nor can they prove thatthe death can be definitively attributed to ‘pneumonia’. Nevertheless, thebelief that ‘pneumonia’ is a major health problem for children in Bangladeshresulted in the introduction, during 2015, of the PCV (pneumococcal conjugatevaccine) that is claimed to prevent pneumonia caused by Streptococcuspneumoniae.Despite the claim that vaccines prevent disease and save lives, there is a largeand growing body of evidence that demonstrates vaccines are significantcontributory factors to illness and death. Most cases of illness and death afterthe administration of vaccines involve babies and small children under the ageof five, who are subjected to ever-increasing numbers of vaccines that areclaimed to protect them from disease.The medical establishment vehemently denies that vaccines cause damage, exceptin very ‘rare’ cases, and justifies this with reference to the millions ofvaccines that are administered each year without any adverse effects. Thisdenial is disingenuous; it fails to recognise that the reactions referred to as‘normal’, such as fever and pain at the injection site, are evidence of harmcaused by the vaccine; these effects are not a sign that the vaccine is‘working’ but a sign that the body has reacted to a substance that it regards astoxic. Furthermore, a single exception to a rule invalidates the rule. The deathof a single child from a procedure claimed to be protective is a profoundtragedy.In addition to this most extreme outcome, are the many other ‘effects’, whichcan vary from subtle and barely perceptible to severe and serious, such as thosethat may be labelled as ‘autism’, ADD or ADHD. Some effects may becomenoticeable soon after the administration of the vaccine; others may not becomeapparent until weeks, months or even years have elapsed. The most importantpoint to emphasise is that the introduction of toxic and neurotoxic materialsinto the body can only be detrimental to health.The purpose of ‘immunisation’ is to eradicate ‘infectious diseases’; yet,despite the practice having existed for more than two centuries, the only human‘infectious disease’ that is claimed to have been successfully eradicated issmallpox. But this is hardly a cause for celebration, as the number of‘infectious diseases’ claimed to exist has risen dramatically over the sameperiod of time.Nevertheless, as the discussions in chapter two indicated, the medicalestablishment claims that polio is very close to eradication. According to theMarch 2019 WHO fact sheet entitled Poliomyelitis, there were 33 reported casesin 2018; interestingly however, earlier versions of the fact sheet indicate thatthis does not represent a continuing decline in numbers; the April 2017 factsheet reported the number of cases at 37; whereas the number of cases reportedin the March 2018 fact sheet was 22. It is nevertheless claimed that there hasbeen an overall decrease of 99 per cent in the number of cases since 1988 whenthe intensive polio vaccination campaign was launched. The 2019 fact sheet alsomakes the bold claim that,> “Polio vaccine, given multiple times, can protect a child for life.”The ‘success’ of the polio vaccine is said to be illustrated by the example ofPakistan, which had been regarded as the most polio-endemic country. Accordingto the web page entitled Polio in Pakistan, this country has experienced a vastreduction in cases of paralysis due to ‘wild poliovirus’; the numbers havefallen from 306 in 2014, to 20 in 2016 and only 3 in 2017.Unfortunately, the WHO fact sheet, as well as other sources that report the‘success’ of the polio eradication campaign, fail to refer to the phenomenalincrease in the incidence of AFP and, more recently, NFAFP (non-polio acuteflaccid paralysis) in many countries. This problem is highlighted by a 2012article entitled Polio programme: let us declare victory and move on, written bytwo Indian medical doctors and published in the Indian Journal of MedicalEthics; the article states that,> “…while India has been polio-free for a year, there has been a huge increase> in non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP).”The doctors refer to NFAFP in their article as being,> “Clinically indistinguishable from polio paralysis but twice as deadly…”The information reported in the article was compiled from the National PolioSurveillance Project, which is claimed to show,> “…that the non-polio AFP rate increases in proportion to the number of polio> vaccine doses received in each area.”The OPV contains ‘live’ but attenuated viruses; this is claimed to mean that thevaccine can shed viruses, which may spread to other people and cause furthercases of polio and paralysis. But viruses are not living organisms; they cannot‘infect’ people; they cannot cause disease; they cannot cause paralysis.Although viruses are not the cause, it must not be assumed that oral vaccinescannot cause paralysis; the discussion in chapter two showed that many vaccineingredients are neurotoxic and therefore eminently capable of producing neuraldamage and paralysis. The fact that the OPV is not injected does not mean it isincapable of causing neurological damage and paralysis. The risk of paralysisfollowing the oral polio vaccine is acknowledged by a May 2014 WHO informationsheet entitled Observed Rate of Vaccine Reactions. Polio Vaccines that states,> “Despite its many advantages, OPV carries the risk of vaccine-associated> paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) particularly among infants…”The situation has been exacerbated by the creation of yet another ‘condition’,called acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), which is regarded as a different form ofAFP. The CDC web page entitled Acute Flaccid Myelitis states that it affects thenervous system and has,> “…a variety of causes such as viruses…”The CDC makes the claim that this condition can be prevented by certain actions,> “…such as staying up-to-date on vaccines…”Although some cases of paralysis have occurred after the administration of thepolio vaccine, other cases have occurred after the administration of other‘medicines’. A February 1997 article entitled Paralytic poliomyelitis in a ruralarea of north India reported in the National Medical Journal of India refers tothe identification of 37 cases of paralysis during a study conducted between1990 and 1991 and states that,> “Of these...60% had a history of intramuscular injections preceding> paralysis.”These injections were administered for the control of fevers. Although 37 is arelatively small number of cases of paralysis, the fact that 60 per cent hadreceived a prior injection is not insignificant. Furthermore, the article alsostates that,> “The prevalence of paralytic poliomyelitis in the villages surveyed was high> despite a stepping up of the national immunization programme.”There are other substances, in addition to vaccines, antibiotics and drugs, thatcontain neurotoxic substances and are capable of inducing paralysis that may belabelled ‘polio’, AFP, NPAFP or AFM; these include pesticides and toxicchemicals, such as formaldehyde. It should be noted that DDT was not banned inIndia and that formaldehyde is one of the products of the Indian chemicalindustry. Lead is another neurotoxic substance capable of inducing paralysis; itis also ubiquitous in India. A July 2013 article entitled Lead poisoning affects20% Kolkata kids reported the results of a study conducted in Kolkata, which haddiscovered that,> “...at least 20% of the city’s children are affected by lead poisoning, which> is turning out to be a bigger threat than anyone imagines.”One of the main culprits, according to the article, is the leaded paint used onchildren’s toys, although, as previously discussed, there are many sources ofexposure to lead. Dr Herbert Needleman states in his 2004 article entitled LeadPoisoning that,> “Patients with high blood levels may present with severe intractable colic,> motor clumsiness, clouded consciousness, weakness and paralysis.”Unsurprisingly, polio has been described as one of the most feared diseases inindustrialised countries, which indicates that it has an association with‘industrialisation’; a connection that is assiduously avoided by the medicalestablishment. However, increased ‘industrialisation’ within ‘developing’countries will inevitably lead to increased exposures to many toxic andneurotoxic substances.The promotion of the goal to achieve ‘vaccines for all’ clearly presents vaccinemanufacturers with lucrative opportunities, not only to increase profits fromincreased sales of vaccines for known diseases, but to develop new vaccines forlesser-known diseases. A January 2017 article entitled Vaccines for three deadlyviruses fast-tracked refers to the thoughts of scientists on this issue andstates that,> “Scientists have named three relatively little-known diseases they think could> cause the next global health emergency.”These diseases have been chosen from a list of ten that, according to thearticle,> “…the World Health Organization (WHO) has identified as potentially causing> the next major outbreak.”On the basis of fear-mongering claims of this nature, the pharmaceuticalindustry continues to develop vaccines to prevent and even, in some cases, to‘treat’ a variety of different ‘diseases’; as indicated by the PhRMA web pageentitled Medicines in Development for Vaccines 2017 Update that states,> “Today, there are 264 vaccines in development by America’s biopharmaceutical> companies to both prevent and treat diseases.”Although vaccines are claimed to be able to prevent ‘infectious diseases’, only137 of the 264 new vaccines are for this type of disease; surprisingly, 101 ofthem are being developed for different cancers.There is an increasing level of awareness that vaccines are not as safe or aseffective as they are claimed to be, but the overwhelming majority of peoplenevertheless retain the belief that vaccines are necessary to prevent‘infectious diseases’, if only they could be made ‘safer’. This false belief isbased on the equally erroneous theory about ‘herd immunity’, which claims that‘infectious diseases’ can be prevented on the proviso that a sufficiently largepercentage of the population has been immunised.The rigid adherence to the ‘germ theory’ and to the fallacy that vaccines are‘safe and effective’ renders the medical establishment incapable of addressingthe real causes of the health problems mistakenly identified as ‘communicablediseases’, especially in ‘developing’ countries’ where they are claimed to bemost prevalent, as the next series of discussions will demonstrate.Communicable DiseasesTarget 3 of SDG 3 aims to,> “By 2030, end the epidemic of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected> tropical diseases and combat hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other> communicable diseases.”It is claimed that the ‘communicable diseases’ specifically referred to in SDG3.3 are particularly prevalent in ‘developing’ countries; a claim that isentirely consistent with the idea expressed in the Global Health Risks reportwhich, as cited in the previous section, refers to a correlation between acountry’s stage of development and the type of diseases that affect itspopulation. By contrast, however, and as also cited in the previous section, theInfectious Diseases of Poverty report states that diseases of this nature affect‘poor populations globally’; this means therefore, that they are not exclusiveto the poor in ‘developing’ countries. The term ‘infectious diseases of poverty’is stated in the report to refer to,> “…a number of diseases which are known to be more prevalent among poorer> populations rather than a definitive group of diseases.”This description is somewhat vague and decidedly unhelpful in identifying thediseases to which it is intended to refer; nevertheless, the report indicatesthat ‘poor people’ are more vulnerable to certain diseases due to their ‘socialand economic deprivation’, which is claimed to mean that these people,> “…have a greater exposure to the risk factors for disease…”On the web page entitled Risk factors the WHO describes a ‘risk factor’ as,> “…any attribute, characteristic or exposure of an individual that increases> the likelihood of developing a disease or injury.”The ‘risk factors’ referred to on the web page are: underweight; unsafe sex;high blood pressure; tobacco and alcohol consumption; and unsafe water,sanitation and hygiene. It should be obvious that these ‘factors’ are notexclusive to ‘developing’ countries, nor are they exclusive to poor people. Thereference to ‘risk factors’ as necessary for the development of a communicabledisease is not consistent with the ‘germ theory’, which claims ‘germs’ are thecauses of disease and can infect anyone, anywhere; it does not state that ‘riskfactors’ must also be present. Furthermore, the purpose of vaccination is tostimulate the body to produce antibodies against the ‘germs’ claimed to be thecauses of disease; vaccines are not claimed to have any effect on the ‘riskfactors’ that contribute to the development of communicable diseases.There are clearly many anomalies, inconsistencies and contradictions within the‘information’ promulgated by the medical establishment about communicablediseases; but the problem is even more fundamental than this. In all fields ofscientific enquiry, empirical evidence should always take priority; theories aresupposed to explain phenomena in the ‘real world’. The ‘germ theory’ and theprevailing narratives about ‘infectious diseases’ do not correlate with orprovide explanations for the evidence garnered from the real world, andespecially from ‘developing’ countries.A 2014 article entitled The contribution of vaccination to global health: past,present and future states that the majority of deaths from infectious diseasesduring the 1960s occurred in the ‘developing world’ where vaccine coverage waslow; it also states that the vaccines that were administered were,> “…restricted largely to children of the small, wealthy section of the> community, the group at least risk of a serious outcome from an infection such> as measles.”Although the article fails to explain why children in the wealthy section have amuch lower risk of ‘a serious outcome from an infection’, it does acknowledge,albeit in a limited manner, that the decline in child mortality in‘industrialised’ countries is not attributable to vaccines, but that it is,> “…associated with improvements in housing, nutrition and sanitation.”The contribution to improved health from these and other measures introducedinto ‘developed’ countries was discussed in chapter two. It would therefore seemthat these measures, in addition to others discussed in this chapter, are the‘factors’ that ought to be promoted by health organisations such as the WHO forurgent implementation in ‘developing’ countries. Measures that are known to beassociated with improved health should certainly be given a far higher prioritythan vaccines, which are proven to be hazardous to health, not supportive of it.Unfortunately, the medical establishment continues to produce large numbers ofvoluminous reports that refer to an unacceptably high level of morbidity andmortality from various diseases, especially ‘communicable diseases’, for thepurpose of promoting ‘medicines and vaccines for all’. The Infectious Diseasesof Poverty report is a pertinent example, as it claims that almost 9 millionpeople died in 2008 from ‘infectious diseases’; however, and most significantly,the report adds the revealing comment that,> “Given the sketchy data, misdiagnosis and under-detection that are typical of> health systems in impoverished areas, these numbers are almost certainly> underestimated.”The existence of ‘sketchy data’ is further supported by the statement in thereport that,> “…in November 2011, Dr Margaret Chan, Director-General of the World Health> Organization stated that “At present, some 85 countries, representing 65% of> the world’s population, do not have reliable cause-of-death statistics.”The paucity of data about mortality and the causes of death remains a problemthat is further substantiated by the WHO World Health Statistics 2017 reportthat states,> “…only 38% of all global deaths are currently reported to the WHO Mortality> Database…”These statements raise fundamental questions about the veracity of mortalitystatistics quoted by health organisations, especially the WHO; they also raisequestions about the reliability of statistics about the incidence of specificdisease conditions, many of which are acknowledged to be difficult to diagnoseaccurately. Although statistics are admitted by the medical establishment tooften be estimates, the most significant point is that people in ‘developing’countries who suffer ill-health cannot be restored to health by pharmaceuticalproducts; the provision of ‘medicines and vaccines for all’ will lead to anincreased incidence of iatrogenic illness and death, it will not lead toimproved health.Although a number of ‘infectious diseases’ were discussed in chapter four, thosespecifically referred to in SDG 3.3 as ‘epidemic’ require further examination,especially with respect to their prevalence in ‘developing’ countries. Thesediscussions will also examine some of the genuine health problems suffered bypeople who live in these countries, in order to ascertain their real causes andthereby provide suggestions for some of the measures by which ill-health can beproperly addressed.As with earlier chapters, the definition of each disease referred to as the‘establishment definition’ are from the 2007 edition of the Oxford ConciseMedical Dictionary, unless otherwise stated.HepatitisThe establishment definition of hepatitis refers to,> “inflammation of the liver caused by viruses, toxic substances, or> immunological abnormalities.”The definition also refers to ‘infectious hepatitis’, which is regarded as themost common form of the disease and usually caused by one of five 5 differenttypes of ‘hepatitis virus’ identified by the letters A to E. Each type ofhepatitis infection, which is determined by blood tests that detect ‘antibodies’specific to each type of virus, is associated with different symptoms andoutcomes. The most significant infections are those claimed to be caused byhepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses; as indicated by the WHO web page entitledHepatitis that states,> “…viral hepatitis B and C infections are key causes of primary liver cancer –> the second most common cancer in the world.”The July 2018 WHO fact sheet entitled Hepatitis C states that,> “Hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes both acute and chronic infection.”The fact sheet indicates that ‘acute’ HCV infection is not a serious healthproblem,> “Acute HCV infection is usually asymptomatic, and is only very rarely (if> ever) associated with life-threatening disease.”An ‘asymptomatic infection’ is a contradiction in terms; the medicalestablishment defines an infection as an invasion by a pathogen, which, bydefinition, causes a disease, which, by definition, involves recognisable signsand symptoms.Unlike acute infection, ‘chronic’ HCV infection is claimed to be serious; buteven this does not always lead to a life-threatening disease, as the fact sheetalso states,> “Of those with chronic HCV infection, the risk of cirrhosis of the liver is> between 15-30% within 20 years.”There is no explanation for the claim that a ‘chronic infection’ can take up totwo decades to develop into a serious health problem; liver problems can,however, be explained by other causal factors, most notably ‘toxic substances’,as indicated by the establishment definition.The fact sheet refers to the three remaining ‘viruses’ and claims that hepatitisA does not cause chronic liver disease; that hepatitis E is mainlyself-limiting; and that hepatitis D only occurs in the presence of hepatitis B.It would seem therefore that the hepatitis B virus is the cause of the mostserious form of liver ‘infection’; a view that is confirmed by the July 2018 WHOfact sheet entitled Hepatitis B that refers to it as a ‘major global healthproblem’ and states that,> “Hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused by the> hepatitis B virus (HBV)”Vaccines have, so far, only been developed for hepatitis A and B; but only thelatter is included in most routine infant vaccination schedules, as the factsheet states,> “The hepatitis B vaccine is the mainstay of hepatitis prevention. WHO> recommends that all infants receive the hepatitis B vaccine as soon as> possible after birth, preferably within 24 hours.”The reason for the urgency to administer this vaccine is based on the idea thatthe virus is often transmitted from the mother to the baby at birth.The web page entitled Hepatitis B Vaccine indicates that the HBV vaccines usedin the UK contain ‘a small amount of aluminium’ and may also contain ‘tinytraces’ of formaldehyde. Previous discussions have referred to the hazardousnature of both of these substances. The page also reveals that the HBV vaccinecontains a viral protein produced using recombinant DNA technology; in otherwords, genetic engineering. The discussion about GMOs in chapter sixdemonstrated that genetic engineering is imprecise and unpredictable and hasbeen associated with serious health effects. The long-term health consequencesof injecting material produced using genetic engineering techniques into thebodies of newborn babies have yet to be revealed; the use of such technology forvaccines is a relatively recent phenomenon.It is reported that hepatitis B infection is potentially ‘life-threatening’; yetthe fact sheet makes the surprising statement that,> “Most people do not experience any symptoms during the acute infection phase.”It is claimed that ‘acute’ infection can, however, cause extremely unpleasantsymptoms for some people and these may include: yellowing of the skin and eyes(jaundice), extreme fatigue, nausea and vomiting. These symptoms are certainlyindicative of liver problems, but they are not caused by any ‘virus’.Surprisingly, the fact sheet states that there is no specific treatment for theacute stage of hepatitis B infection, but the recommendation by the WHO is toprovide ‘adequate nutritional balance’ and to replace lost fluids. It should benoted that chronic HBV infection is not diagnosed by the presence of the virus,but by the persistent presence of the hepatitis B ‘antigen’; and that, accordingto the fact sheet, chronic HBV infection only develops into cirrhosis or cancerin ‘some’ cases.Unlike acute infection, the chronic form is said to be treatable with‘medicines’, including oral antivirals such as tenofovir and entecavir, both ofwhich are recommended by the WHO. Tenofovir is a drug that is more commonlyprescribed for the treatment of ‘HIV infection’, although it is claimed to beequally ‘effective’ for HBV. However, according to the AIDSinfo pages on the NIHwebsite, this drug,> “…can cause serious life-threatening side effects.”One of the serious ‘side effects’ of tenofovir involves ‘severe liver problems’;the fact that this drug is known to cause liver damage would indicate thattenofovir is entirely unsuitable for use as a ‘treatment’ for liver disease. Thecommon side effects associated with entecavir are no better; they include nauseaand vomiting, which are two symptoms commonly associated with hepatitis B; thisdrug is also reported to cause ‘severe liver symptoms’. Yet again, this is adrug that can cause the very symptoms it is intended to ‘treat’. These drugs areboth clearly dangerous, but they do not even have the ability to ‘cure’ thedisease; as the fact sheet states,> “In most people, however, the treatment does not cure hepatitis infection, but> only suppresses the replication of the virus. Therefore, most people who start> hepatitis B treatment must continue it for life.”The parts of the world considered to be most affected by infection with thehepatitis B ‘virus’ are the WHO Western Pacific Region and the WHO AfricanRegion; it is claimed that approximately 6 per cent of the populations in eachof these regions are ‘infected’ with hepatitis. The Western Pacific Region,which includes countries such as Australia, Cambodia, China, Japan, Malaysia,Singapore and New Zealand, is said to bear the highest burden of hepatitis B.According to the WPRO web page, the Western Pacific region is home toapproximately 25 per cent of the world’s population, but,> “…it accounts for more than 50% of the hepatitis-related deaths worldwide.”Statistics of this nature are used to justify the introduction of hepatitis Bvaccination programmes that are claimed to have been ‘successful’; as indicatedby the WPRO web page entitled 7 Million Deaths Averted through Hepatitis BVaccination. This ‘success’ is stated to be a step towards the achievement ofthe 2030 Agenda goal to eliminate hepatitis. Another WPRO article entitledDelivering additional interventions to eliminate mother-to-child transmission ofhepatitis B in the Western Pacific states that the elimination of hepatitis Binfection will occur with the attainment of the target of,> “…0.1% hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) prevalence among children…”The article also claims that the three doses of the vaccine induce,> “…protective antibody levels in more than 95% of infants. However, perinatal> infection still occurs, especially among infants born to mothers with high> hepatitis B viral load.”The main concern about ‘infection’ with hepatitis B is that it is claimed tolead to liver cancer; however, previous discussions have demonstrated that themechanism of action of cancer is completely different from that attributed to an‘infection’.The liver is the body’s main detoxification organ; a ‘problem’ within this organtherefore indicates that its ability to function normally has been impaired,most likely as the result of an excess body burden of toxins. The liver problemscaused by an excess of toxins can be illustrated by the known associationbetween a high consumption of alcohol over a prolonged period of time andcirrhosis, which can progress to liver cancer. However, alcohol is by no meansthe only toxic substance that adversely affects the liver; others can cause moreserious damage far more quickly than alcohol.Although the medical establishment claims that the infectious form of hepatitisis far more common, it is clear that ‘toxins’ contribute significantly to liverdamage and that exposures to ‘carcinogens’ are able to precipitate primary livercancer, without the need to invoke the existence of a ‘virus’. The liver isrecognised to have many different and extremely important functions, includingdetoxification; interestingly, a June 2012 article entitled Toxic hepatitis inoccupational exposure to solvents identifies this role as applying equally to‘drugs’,> “The liver is the main organ responsible for the metabolism of drugs and toxic> chemicals…”The article also states that occupational exposures to hepatotoxins are numerousand that these substances include organic solvents, some of which havepreviously been discussed and shown to be the source of health hazards fromoccupations such as dry cleaning. The article refers to a few more occupationsin which exposures to solvents can occur; they include chemists, health careworkers and nurses. The idea that these occupations are hazardous to health maybe surprising, considering that the nature of the work is to assist people to abetter state of health. The hazards associated with these occupations arisepredominantly from the hazardous nature of the chemicals, including solvents,with which ‘medicines’ are manufactured. In addition, the article refers to anumber of industrial processes that involve the use of, and therefore exposuresto, organic solvents. The article adds that,> “…a number of industrial chemicals are known to be hepatotoxins…”Some of the chemicals identified as hepatotoxic are trichloroethylene (TCE),xylene, toluene and chloroform, amongst others.Interestingly, the article also refers to inflammation as a common feature oftoxicity and to oxidative stress as the mechanism by which pathological changesoccur.There are also a number of ‘medicines’ that have been shown to be hepatotoxic.Although referring to ‘hepatitis’, the Mayo Clinic web page entitled toxichepatitis lists many ‘drugs’ that are hepatotoxic, they include:over-the-counter pain relievers, such as paracetamol/acetaminophen, aspirin andibuprofen, as well as prescription medications such as statins, azathioprine andcertain antivirals, such as tenofovir, which is used in the treatment ofhepatitis B infection.The fact that many of the chemicals and solvents recognised to be hepatotoxicare commonly used in industrial processes means that increased‘industrialisation’ within ‘developing’ countries is likely to be accompanied byincreased levels of genuine liver problems.InfluenzaInfluenza is not one of the diseases specifically referred to in SDG 3.3, but itis claimed to be a global phenomenon, as indicated by the November 2018 WHO factsheet entitled Influenza (Seasonal) which states that,> “Seasonal influenza is an acute respiratory infection caused by influenza> viruses which circulate in all parts of the world.”The fact sheet also states that,> “Worldwide, these annual epidemics are estimated to result in about 3 to 5> million cases of severe illness and about 290,000 to 650,000 respiratory> deaths.”As discussed in chapter four, it is claimed that the epidemic referred to as the‘1918 Flu’ was a ‘global health problem’; that an estimated 500 million peopleworldwide were ‘infected’; and that the number of people who died is estimatedto range between 20 and 50 million. These estimated numbers of infections anddeaths are therefore far in excess of those usually associated with influenza;the 1918 ‘pandemic’ was clearly not one of ‘seasonal’ influenza. However, therevelation that the medical establishment does not have reliable mortality andcause-of-death statistics in the early 21st century raises serious questionsabout the veracity of the statistics quoted for the influenza ‘pandemic’ of theearly 20th century.Nevertheless, whatever the accuracy, or otherwise, of the statistics pertainingto the numbers of infections and deaths, the refutation of the ‘germ theory’means that the illness referred to as ‘influenza’, whether of the ‘seasonal’ or‘1918’ variety, cannot be caused by a virus. Although some of the factors thatcontributed to illness and death during 1918 have been discussed, they weremainly those that affected people in Europe and America; the global nature ofthe ‘pandemic’ therefore requires further examination to ascertain the factorsthat would have affected people in other parts of the world.One of the most significant aspects of the ‘pandemic’ is that it occurred in thefourth year of the very first ‘world’ war; a circumstance that cannot bedismissed as irrelevant; this point is highlighted in the Infectious Diseases ofPoverty report, which makes the extremely important and revealing comment that,> “Infectious diseases are prevalent among populations living in conflict and> war zones.”The ‘germ theory’ offers no credible explanation for a correlation between‘infectious diseases’ and ‘conflict and war zones’; the idea that ‘germs’flourish amidst death and destruction cannot be substantiated. Although bacteriaare saprotrophic, and therefore assist the decomposition of dead matter, they donot cause disease.One of the factors that can induce morbidity and mortality during war is‘stress’, or, more accurately, distress, as will be discussed in chapter ten.Although rarely included in most discussions about the ‘1918 Flu’, the stressesof combat experienced during WWI are discussed in a 1918 article entitled WarNeuroses, Shell Shock and Nervousness in Soldiers that states,> “The longer the war goes on, the more it becomes evident how widespread are> the effects of functional nervous disease both in combatant troops and in> patients hospitalised for any cause.”It is clear therefore that soldiers were not the only people affected by thetraumatic experiences of war, nor was the suffering restricted to the war zones.Furthermore, some of the methods used to treat people suffering from shell shockand other nervous conditions were hardly conducive to the restoration of‘health’, as indicated by a March 2012 article entitled Anaesthetic and othertreatments of shell shock: World War 1 and beyond that states,> “Some British doctors tried general anaesthesia as a treatment (ether and> chloroform), while others preferred application of electricity.”Chloroform was abandoned as an appropriate form of anaesthesia when it wasdiscovered to be toxic; it has since been found to be both neurotoxic andhepatotoxic.One of the main ‘treatments’ for ‘influenza’ during that period was aspirin,also known as acetylsalicylic acid. An extract from a November 2009 articleentitled Salicylates and Pandemic Influenza Mortality, 1918-1919 Pharmacology,Pathology and Historic Evidence was cited in chapter four, but deservesrepetition,> “Pharmacokinetic data, which were unavailable in 1918, indicate that the> aspirin regimens recommended for the ‘Spanish influenza’ predispose to severe> pulmonary toxicity.”Severe pulmonary problems were some of the main symptoms experienced by manypeople who are said to have suffered from ‘influenza’; aspirin use thereforecontributed to the worsening of people’s health. Unfortunately, the article doesnot specify the use of aspirin beyond America and Europe; it does, however statethat,> “The loss of Bayer’s patent on aspirin in February 1917 allowed many> manufacturers into the lucrative aspirin market.”The discussion in chapter four also referred to another ‘epidemic’ thatcoincided with that of ‘influenza’, namely lethargic encephalitis (LE), which,according to Dr Peter Breggin, affected more than a million people and causedhundreds of thousands of deaths. The significance of the LE epidemic is that itis referred to as a neurological disease, which indicates exposures toneurotoxic substances that would have included the materials used in munitions,as well as the ingredients of nerve gases and vaccines. Shell-shock, lethargicencephalitis, vaccine damage and exposures to neurotoxins are clearly not‘influenza’, but it would seem that all conditions of illness during thatperiod, from whatever causes, have been conflated and labelled under the singleheading of ‘1918 Flu’; a disease that is said to have claimed more lives thanthe war itself.The war of 1914-1918 was truly a world war; it involved troops that had beenrecruited from many different countries, most of which were colonies of themajor European combatants; especially, Britain and France. The main war zoneinvolved hundreds of miles of trenches across France and Belgium, but many otherconflicts also took place, for example, in the Middle East and North Africa, aswell as in some of the countries in Eastern and Southern Africa that had beencolonised by Germany.Although many countries are said to have been affected by the ‘1918 Flu’, it isclaimed that India was the most affected; as indicated by a 2014 articleentitled The evolution of pandemic influenza: evidence from India 1918-19 thatstates,> “The focal point of the epidemic in terms of mortality was India, with an> estimated death toll range of 10-20 million...”In 1918, India was part of the British Empire and also had an establishedpharmaceutical industry, both of which are likely to have influenced theenthusiasm for the implementation of vaccination programmes in India; asindicated by a 2014 article entitled A brief history of vaccines and vaccinationin India that states,> “The early twentieth century witnessed the challenges in expansion of smallpox> vaccination, typhoid vaccine trial in Indian personnel, and setting up of> vaccine institutes in almost each of the then Indian states.”Cholera and plague vaccines were also used in India, although the extent oftheir coverage is unknown. However, the claim that vaccine institutes were setup in most of the Indian states indicates that vaccination programmes are likelyto have been contributory factors for some of the cases of illness and deathattributed to ‘flu’ in India. The article also refers to one of the commonexplanations for the alleged ‘spread’ of the flu throughout the population inthe comment that,> “The pandemic is believed to have originated from influenza-infected World War> I troops returning home.”The use of the word ‘believed’ indicates that there is little, if any, evidenceto support this claim; but there is a major flaw in the idea that returningtroops were responsible for the spread of the ‘1918 Flu’. This disease isclaimed to have been so deadly that it could kill within days, or even hours. Itis clear therefore that Indian soldiers afflicted by this deadly form of‘influenza’ would not have survived the long journey from a European war zoneback to India. Another major flaw in this argument is the lack of data about thenumber of Indian people who are claimed to have been ‘infected’; as the articlereveals,> “Data on influenza cases, while desirable, are unavailable…”Although data about the incidence of ‘influenza’ are unavailable, the articlerefers to mortality statistics and states that,> “These data show a steep spike in fever mortality in late 1918…”A ‘spike’ in fever mortality does not provide conclusive evidence of theexistence of an epidemic of ‘flu’. There are many reasons for a fever to occur;it is one of the body’s natural processes to eliminate toxins of somedescription.Indian soldiers were deployed to various parts of the world to assist theBritish in the conflict, including Europe where they were also employed inbuilding and defending trenches. The appalling conditions endured in thetrenches were discussed in chapter four and require no repetition; however,these conditions must be included as contributing to the illness and death ofmen from many different countries, not just Europe; these countries includeIndia, Africa, the West Indies and China.Another significant factor is that India experienced what has been described asa ‘crippling drought’ during 1918-19; a situation that is said to have been theresult of the El Niño Southern Climatic Oscillations (ENSO), as reported in aDecember 2014 article entitled Malaria’s contribution to World War One – theunexpected adversary that states,> “The ENSO for 1918-1919 was one of the strongest in the twentieth century.”Malaria is discussed in greater depth later in this chapter, however, a fewdetails about this disease are relevant to the current discussion. According tothe article, malaria was a significant disease that also existed in ‘epidemic’proportions during the war years; although generally,> “…malaria has received little emphasis…”The article also proposes that the trenches provided ideal conditions in whichmosquitoes would breed and that this encouraged their proliferation andtherefore the spread of the disease, particularly in Europe where malaria wasnot considered to be endemic. The eruption of this disease in such areasresulted in the introduction of various ‘treatments’, including, but not limitedto, quinine, which was also used prophylactically. In common with allpharmaceutical products, quinine produces ‘side effects’ that include fever,chills, weakness and breathing difficulties, all of which are symptoms that havealso been associated with the form of ‘influenza’ referred to as the ‘1918 Flu’.India is not, however, the only country to be affected by the ENSO whenever itoccurs, nor was it the only country to have been affected by the strong ENSO of1918-19; many regions in the southern hemisphere were also affected. Parts ofAustralia, for example, are reported to have experienced severe droughts between1918 and 1920. Other regions known to have been affected by the ENSO of 1918-19include Brazil, Central America, Indonesia and the Philippines, as well as partsof Africa. Adverse health problems in these countries are attributed toinfluenza; as indicated by a July 2013 article entitled Mortality from theinfluenza pandemic of 1918-19 in Indonesia, which states that,> “For Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous country, the most widely used> estimate of mortality from that pandemic is 1.5 million.”Indonesia is an archipelago comprised of many thousands of islands; yet thearticle offers no explanation why the people of those islands would have beenaffected by the ‘virus’; it merely calculates population losses and indicatesthat the death toll may have been even greater than the original estimate. Thearticle makes no reference to the ENSO of 1918-19, even though it is widelyreported in scientific articles that the ENSO is known to have an effect on therainfall in Indonesia.Men from African countries that were colonies of the European countries involvedin the war were also drawn into the conflict; as discussed in an articleentitled War Losses (Africa) that refers to the,> “…vast mobilization of African soldiers and laborers for service in Europe> between 1914 and 1918…”The article states that it was mainly the French who recruited men from theirAfrican colonies; however, soldiers and labourers were not the only casualties;the article also claims that,> “…very large, but unknown numbers of African civilians perished during the> war.”Some of the reasons that African civilians died include,> “…famine prompted by a lack of manpower to till the fields, and diseases> exacerbated by malnourishment…”The problems created by the recruitment of the strongest and healthiest men fromAfrican villages into the war were not solved when hostilities ceased in 1918;they persisted long afterwards, especially in the villages to which the mennever returned. Although a paucity of data from Africa means that the actualnumbers of casualties and deaths due to the war remain unknown, they areestimated to be approximately one million; a figure that is comprised of morethan 250,000 soldiers and labourers plus approximately 750,000 civilians.The conditions that related to India and Africa during the early 20th centuryhave been discussed in order to serve as examples of the different circumstancesthat would have given rise to illness and death that is usually, buterroneously, attributed to ‘influenza’. These conditions would also have beenexperienced to varying degrees in other parts of the world affected by the warand the factors referred to in this discussion. It should be clear from theabove together with the discussion in chapter four that there are many credibleexplanations for the morbidity and mortality that have been incorrectlyattributed to a viral infection.The perpetual reference to the huge numbers of deaths due to this ‘deadlypandemic’ does however serve a purpose; the previously cited claim that allsubsequent influenza outbreaks have been caused by descendants of the virusclaimed to have caused the 1918 influenza pandemic, enables the propagation offear and the continued promotion of influenza vaccines in order to prevent areoccurrence of this ‘mother of all pandemics’. The propagation of fearcertainly benefits vaccine manufacturers.It is important to emphasise that the circumstances that existed during the waryears were complex and varied; they were however, unique.HIV/AIDSThe previous discussion about HIV/AIDS revealed that the underlying theory,which claims that a virus called ‘HIV’ is the cause of a disease called ‘AIDS’,is fundamentally flawed. Nevertheless, the medical establishment maintains thestance that HIV/AIDS remains ‘a major global public health issue’; as indicatedby the inclusion of ‘AIDS’ in SDG 3.3 as one of the epidemics to be ‘ended’ by2030.Although the first ‘outbreak’ occurred in the US, it is claimed that Africa, andespecially sub-Saharan Africa, is the main region in which ‘HIV infection’occurs, as the July 2018 WHO fact sheet entitled HIV/AIDS states,> “The WHO African Region is the most affected region, with 25.7 million people> living with HIV in 2017. The African region also accounts for over two thirds> of the global total of new HIV infections.”One of the most important aspects of ‘HIV/AIDS’ in Africa is that, in the 1980sand for many years afterwards, a diagnosis of ‘AIDS’ was based on differentcriteria from those used in most other countries. Prior to the ‘discovery’ ofAIDS, African people who experienced a significant loss of weight wereconsidered to be suffering from a condition known as ‘slim’; but after the 1980sa significant weight loss was perceived to be indicative of ‘AIDS’. Although HIVtests were introduced into many countries from the mid-1980s onwards, theyremained absent from Africa until relatively recently. The reason for this delayis claimed to be that African countries not only lacked the infrastructure andfacilities to conduct widespread testing, they also lacked the finances neededto fund the expensive equipment to process the tests.The criteria on which a diagnosis of ‘AIDS’ in Africa was to be made, were,however, determined soon after the initial reports arose about this new‘epidemic’; these criteria were established at a workshop held in Bangui,Central Africa in October 1985. The ‘Bangui definition’ developed at theworkshop claimed that a diagnosis of AIDS relied on the existence of three outof four major clinical signs, one of which was a loss of body weight thatexceeded 10 per cent; the others were chronic asthenia, chronic fever andchronic diarrhoea. Asthenia means weakness. In addition to these major signswere six minor symptoms, one of which was a chronic cough. These were not,however, particularly unusual symptoms for African people; as indicated byProfessor Charles Geshekter PhD, who states in his 1997 article entitledReappraising AIDS in Africa that,> “Millions of Africans have long suffered from severe weight loss, chronic> diarrhea, fever and persistent coughs.”The claim that a combination of these symptoms represented ‘AIDS’ in an Africanperson, despite the absence of a confirmatory ‘HIV test’, contrasts vividly witha diagnosis of ‘AIDS in virtually every other country, where a positive HIV testresult was required before a diagnosis of AIDS could be confirmed. This point iscorroborated by Dr Eleni Papadopulos-Eleopulos and Dr Valendar Turner of thePerth Group, who state in their 1995 article entitled AIDS in Africa? that,> “Unlike the West, AIDS in Africa is diagnosed without any laboratory tests.”The article refers to a WHO report, which claimed that in the mid-1990s, 2.5million sub-Saharan Africans had AIDS, but the article adds that,> “However, there is no convincing evidence that millions of Africans are> infected with HIV…”Another 1995 article, entitled AIDS in Africa: distinguishing fact and fiction,which was co-authored by Dr Papadopulos-Eleopulos and three colleagues, explainsthat,> “The evidence for the existence of HIV in Africa is based on the random> testing of Africans for the presence of HIV antibodies.”As discussed in chapter four, HIV tests do not detect the presence of a ‘virus’,they only detect the presence of ‘antibodies’, which are proteins. Thatdiscussion also explained that the main proteins claimed to be associated withHIV, namely p24 and p41, are not specific to HIV, nor are they specific toillness. This means therefore, that the detection of these proteins ismeaningless with respect to a person’s state of health.The majority of tests conducted in Africa prior to 2001 were performed inantenatal clinics, as indicated by a 2013 report entitled Demographic Patternsof HIV Testing Uptake in Sub-Saharan Africa that states,> “Before 2001, HIV prevalence was estimated from sentinel surveillance systems> that monitored HIV rates in pregnant women attending antenatal care.”According to the WHO website, the meaning of ‘sentinel surveillance’ is that it,> “…deliberately involves only a limited network of carefully selected reporting> sites.”The previous discussion explained that pregnancy is one of the ‘conditions’known to produce a ‘false positive’ HIV test result. The selection of antenatalclinics as suitable ‘reporting sites’, from which to gather information aboutthe prevalence of ‘HIV infection’ in the general population, can only bedescribed as egregious. The use of data that contain an unknown proportion of‘false positive’ HIV test results, has distorted the statistics that form thebasis of the claims that Africa is still in the midst of a serious ‘HIVinfection’ crisis. The many conditions that can produce ‘false positive’ HIVtest results include tuberculosis and malaria, both of which are regarded asprevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, but neither of which is caused by the‘infectious agent’ with which it is normally associated, as the discussions inthe next two sections will demonstrate.The above cited 2013 report about HIV testing uptake also states that,> “By 2001, international organizations were examining ways to rapidly increase> HIV testing on a global scale and to link HIV-positive individuals to> treatment and care.”The expansion of HIV testing has been facilitated by the development of rapiddiagnostic test (RDT) kits, which are simpler and do not require expensivetechnical equipment; they are therefore more easily available to ‘resource-poor’areas, such as African countries. However, a ‘positive’ result on a rapid testis not deemed to be definitive; it is claimed to indicate that furtherconfirmatory tests should be conducted.In the early 21st century, AIDS is still viewed as a potentially devastatingdisease in Africa, as indicated by a 2006 article entitled Understanding theScourge of HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa that states,> “Sub-Saharan Africa is the epicentre of the HIV/AIDS pandemic and faces an> unprecedented devastation.”The prediction of imminent devastation faced by the population of Africa, andespecially sub-Saharan Africa, has been a constant theme of the ‘information’promulgated since the mid-1980s. The population census reports from many of theAfrican countries claimed to be most affected by ‘AIDS’ demonstrate otherwise;the evidence from census reports shows that population numbers in thesecountries have grown, they have not declined as the result of the deadly‘scourge’ of AIDS. This evidence is reported by Dr Claus Köhnlein and TorstenEngelbrecht in their 2007 book entitled Virus Mania, in which they refer to,> “…the extreme discrepancy evident between perpetual predictions of horror> (‘Africa will be depopulated by AIDS’) and actual population increases.”The failure of AIDS to decimate the populations of African countries is claimedby the medical establishment to be attributable to the availability of simplerrapid tests, which have enabled increased numbers of people to be tested, and tobetter and faster access to ‘treatment’ for those people whose test result issaid to be ‘positive’.In September 2015, the WHO issued guidelines that made two recommendations, oneof which was that ART (antiretroviral therapy) should be given to everyone‘living with HIV’ whatever their CD4 cell count. The second recommendation wasfor the use of ART as a preventive, by means of PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis).This strategy is referred to as ‘scaling-up’ ART, part of the reason for whichis to create a ‘standardised approach’; as described in an October 2014 articleentitled Simplification of antiretroviral therapy: a necessary step in thepublic health response to HIV/AIDS in resource-limited settings, which statesthat,> “...simplified prescribing practices support task shifting of care to nursing> and other non-physician clinicians...”The result of increased testing and treatment is discussed in a 2016 articleentitled HIV Infection and AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa: Current Status,Challenges and Opportunities that refers to,> “…major advances in treating HIV, as the availability and rapid scale up of> antiretroviral therapy (ART) has transformed what was inevitably a fatal> disease to a chronic manageable condition…”The ‘success’ of increased access to ART is also reported by the WHO in the factsheet that states,> “Between 2000 and 2017, new HIV infections fell by 36%, and HIV-related deaths> fell by 38% with 11.4 million lives saved due to ART in the same period.”The discussion in chapter four revealed that ART is highly toxic; this‘treatment’ cannot save lives.Nevertheless, the WHO claims that continuing to expand access to ART is at theheart of the efforts to achieve the SDG aim to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030.The idea expressed in the 2016 article cited above that ART has transformed a‘fatal disease’ into a ‘manageable condition’, encourages the notion that peopleno longer suffer from ‘AIDS’, but instead are ‘living with HIV’, the scale ofwhich is still claimed to be considerable; as indicated by the WHO fact sheetthat states,> “There were approximately 36.9 million people living with HIV at the end of> 2017…”Although perceived as authoritative, these statistics are not based on actualdata. The UNAIDS website contains a July 2017 page entitled Accurate andcredible UNAIDS data on the HIV epidemic: the cornerstone of the AIDS response,which admits that,> “We don’t count people. We can’t – many people who are living with HIV don’t> know that they are, so can’t be counted.”The claim that there are people who are ‘living with HIV’ but unaware of it, isused to instil fear, so that people will be more likely to undergo an ‘HIV test’in order to ‘know their status’. The discovery of a ‘positive’ status will thenlead to the commencement of ‘treatment’ with antiretroviral drugs, the purposeof which is claimed to be the suppression of viral replication, which needs tobe continued and ‘treatment’ therefore becomes lifelong. The drugs recommendedby the WHO fact sheet for use as ART include dolutegravir, efavirenz,raltegravir, darunavir and ritonavir. The AIDS Info website provides informationabout these drugs and refers to them all as being able to cause ‘seriouslife-threatening side effects’ that may include liver problems; in other words,they are all inherently toxic. Yet these highly dangerous drugs are claimed tobe ‘life-saving’ and able to protect people from an ‘infection’ with a ‘virus’,that has never been scientifically proven to cause any disease.One of the significant effects associated with the use of ART is referred to asIRIS (immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome), which is described in a 2011article, appropriate titled, The Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome,which refers to it as,> “A paradoxical clinical worsening of a known condition or the appearance of a> new condition after initiating antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected> patients…”The article claims that the incidence of IRIS is ‘largely unknown’ and states,> “Despite numerous descriptions of the manifestations of IRIS, its pathogenesis> remains largely speculative.”There is, however, a very clear explanation for the ‘paradoxical’ phenomenonreferred to as IRIS; which is that it occurs as the direct result of theingestion of toxic drugs; it is therefore not a ‘paradox’, nor should it bereferred to as a ‘syndrome’.Unfortunately, the fact that pregnancy can give rise to a ‘false positive’ HIVtest result, means that many pregnant women are inappropriately diagnosed as‘living with HIV’ and ‘treated’ with highly toxic drugs, as the WHO fact sheetstates,> “Global ART coverage for pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV is> high at 80%.”Against this seeming ‘success’ must be contrasted the evidence that ART does notsave lives, but instead these drugs cost lives; as indicated by a 2008 articleentitled Early mortality among adults accessing antiretroviral treatmentprogrammes in sub-Saharan Africa that refers to,> “…early mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa are very high; between 8% and> 26% of patients die in the first year of ART, with most deaths occurring in> the first few months.”Although these deaths are attributed to a variety of causes, including otherdiseases, this is obfuscation, as it diverts attention from the logicalconclusion that these deaths are the direct result of ART. Whilst toxic drugsmay not be the sole cause, they cannot be dismissed as irrelevant to an ‘earlymortality’ that occurs soon after the initiation of ‘treatment’ with drugs thatare known to be toxic.There are many reasons that people in Africa and other ‘developing’ countriesexperience a variety of illnesses; poverty, malnutrition, lack of clean waterand lack of basic sanitation are some of the contributory factors, as are toxicmedications, but these are not the only relevant ones. One particularlysignificant factor that is generally omitted from discussions about theprevalence of ‘disease’ in ‘developing’ countries, is exposure to a wide varietyof toxic chemicals produced and used by various industries. A May 2001 articleentitled The ticking time bomb: toxic pesticide waste dumps states that,> “Huge stocks of toxic pesticide waste are a serious problem in almost all> developing countries...”The stocks referred to are not merely excess pesticide stock intended for useagainst the pests of these countries, they also refer to pesticides that havebeen dumped in ‘developing’ countries, because they have been banned in‘developed’ countries or because they have passed their expiry date. Thesebanned, old or obsolete pesticides are often delivered to ‘developing’ countriesunder the guise of ‘aid’, but this is also used as a ploy by donor corporationsto avoid the proper, but expensive disposal of these highly toxic chemicals. Thearticle also states that,> “The waste sites contain some of the most dangerous insecticides in existence.> They include aldrin, chlordane, DDT, dieldrin, endrin and heptachlor, which> have been banned in most countries, along with organophosphates.”The article refers to pesticide waste sites that are frequently situated nearfarms, wells, dwellings, food stores and markets. Unsurprisingly, the articlereports that people living in the vicinity of these sites have experienced avariety of health problems. Pesticides are, of course, only one group of toxicsubstances to which people in ‘developing’ countries are exposed; but they areparticularly relevant to the measures used to control ‘vector-borne’ diseases,such as malaria, that are claimed to be prevalent in Africa and particularly insub-Saharan Africa; a number of these types of disease are discussed later inthis chapter.The existence of ill-health in Africa and all other ‘developing’ countries ismore than adequately explained by a wide variety of contributory factors,including many of those discussed in chapter six that also affect people in‘developed’ countries; however, none of the factors that cause illness is a‘virus’ known as HIV.The plight of people who are genuinely ill, but have been assigned a misleadinglabel of ‘living with HIV’ as the result of a meaningless test, is a tragedy ofimmense proportions; it is, however, an even greater tragedy that healthypeople, including pregnant women, are also assigned this label for which theytoo are poisoned with toxic drugs that have the potential to cause ill-healthand even an early death.TuberculosisTuberculosis is another of the diseases specifically referred to in SDG 3.3 asan epidemic to be ‘ended’ by 2030. The magnitude of this ‘epidemic’ is indicatedby the September 2018 WHO fact sheet entitled Tuberculosis, which claims thatapproximately 1.6 million people died from the disease in 2017. This mortalityfigure means that tuberculosis is now considered to be the greatest ‘killer’disease caused by a single ‘infectious agent’.The theory that TB is caused by a bacterium has been shown to be fatally flawed;the reason for a further discussion about this disease is because, likeHIV/AIDS, it is said to primarily affect ‘developing’ countries, as the factsheet states,> “Over 95% of cases and deaths are in developing countries.”Although HIV/AIDS has previously been promoted as the disease that posed thegreatest threat to humanity, this is clearly no longer the case. The fact sheetclaims, however, that there is an association between TB and ‘HIV’ and statesthat,> “People living with HIV are 20 to 30 times more likely to develop active TB> disease than people without HIV.”It should be noted that the original theory about HIV/AIDS claimed that apositive HIV test result would override a prior diagnosis of another condition.In other words, a diagnosis of TB with a negative HIV test result would remain acase of tuberculosis; whereas a diagnosis of TB in the presence of a positiveHIV test result would become a case of ‘AIDS’, which has since been replaced bythe category ‘living with HIV’.The claim that TB and HIV commonly co-exist is highly anomalous for a fewreasons. One reason is that the HIV/AIDS fact sheet claims that globally 36.9million people were ‘living with HIV’ at the end of 2017 and of that total 25.7million, or almost 70 per cent, were in the African Region, whereas the TB factsheet claims that 62 per cent of the new cases of TB in 2017 occurred in theSouth East Asia and Western Pacific Region.Another reason is that TB is referred to as a bacterial disease whereas HIV/AIDSis ‘viral’. It is claimed that the relationship between them is that an ‘HIVinfection’ causes the immune system to become weak and therefore vulnerable toan opportunistic infection, the most common of which is TB; this is, however, amisleading claim. A more plausible reason for a relationship between them isbecause, as previously discussed, TB is one of the conditions that can produce a‘false positive’ HIV test result.Although tuberculosis mainly affects ‘developing’ countries, it is not entirelyabsent from ‘developed’ countries, some of which have experienced a resurgenceof TB in recent years; as reported in a 2003 article entitled The world-wideincrease in tuberculosis: how demographic changes, HIV infection and increasingnumbers in poverty are increasing tuberculosis. Interestingly, the articlereports that the increased incidence of TB in some ‘developed’ countries beganin the mid-1980s, a date that coincides with the early years of the so-called‘AIDs epidemic’. It would seem therefore that the 1980s was a period duringwhich there was an overall increasing incidence of ill-health. The articlepredicts that the incidence of TB will continue to rise and bases thisprediction on the three influences referred to in its title. The third factorthat is claimed to influence the rise of TB cases globally is of particularsignificance; the article states that,> “…as more and more people are forced to live in poverty, where poor nutrition> and crowded conditions lead to the spread of tuberculosis, the disease risk> will be compounded.”These conditions are commonly associated with TB; other sources, however, posita different view, one that claims these conditions are not relevant to the onsetof TB. This latter view, which is based on the erroneous belief that TB iscaused solely by a bacterium, is expressed in a 2011 article entitledTuberculosis: current situation, challenges and overview of its control programsin India that states,> “Surprisingly, in India, people are still under the impression that TB is a> disease of poor people, mostly of those living in slums.”The article claims that rich people are also ‘at risk’ from the disease because,for example, their ‘staff’, who may appear to be healthy, may be ‘asymptomaticcarriers’, about which the article states,> “Since the immune system in healthy people walls off the causative bacteria,> TB infection in healthy people is often asymptomatic.”As discussed in chapter four, ‘asymptomatic carriers’ are said to be able totransmit disease, whereas people with ‘latent TB infection’ cannot. This isclearly anomalous, and poses a direct challenge to the basic assumption thatinfection with TB bacteria is the cause of tuberculosis, which is a communicabledisease. The medical establishment fails to explain the absence of symptoms orthe idea that ‘TB infection’ can give rise to two mutually exclusive outcomes;nevertheless, the WHO fact sheet claims that,> “About one-quarter of the world’s population has latent TB…”The lifetime ‘risk’ that people with ‘latent TB infection’ (LTBI) will developactive TB disease is claimed to be between 5 to 15 per cent, although this riskis said to be dependent upon other factors, as the fact sheet also claims,> “…persons with compromised immune systems, such as people living with HIV,> malnutrition or diabetes, or people who use tobacco, have a much higher risk> of falling ill.”The WHO Global Tuberculosis Report 2017, which will be referred to as the TBReport, discusses the phenomenon of latent TB infection and defines it as,> “…a state of persistent immune response to M. tuberculosis without clinically> manifested evidence of active TB disease.”Interestingly, a diagnosis of LTBI is made using the same ‘tests’ as those usedto diagnose tuberculosis, except that LTBI is not accompanied by the symptoms of‘active disease’. It is important to note that these tests do not detect thepresence of TB ‘germs’; as the fact sheet states, they only indicate,> “…the presence of an immunological response to TB bacteria.”The TB Report admits that the tests for LTBI have limitations, one of which isthat they cannot determine whether a person is likely to progress to active TBdisease or not. Despite the limitations of the tests, the WHO recommends thatcertain individuals who have tested positive for LTBI should receive treatmentin order to avoid the risk that they will develop active TB disease. The peopleconsidered to be ‘most at risk’ include those who are said to be ‘living withHIV’; people with this spurious label are not only in danger of being poisonedwith toxic antiretroviral drugs, they are also at risk of being poisoned withtoxic antibiotic drugs. Yet neither of these so-called ‘treatments’ is able toaddress underlying health problems.Isoniazid, one of the most common antibiotic drugs used to treat ‘TB disease’,is also used to treat LTBI; as previously discussed, isoniazid is associatedwith many adverse health effects. A 2014 article entitled Adverse effects ofisoniazid preventative therapy for latent tuberculosis infection: a prospectivecohort study refers to hepatotoxicity as a recognised ‘side effect’ of IPT(isoniazid preventative therapy) and adds that,> “However, a wide variety of less well-documented adverse effects have been> observed in association with IPT, including acneiform and other rashes,> gastrointestinal adverse effects, peripheral neuropathy, drowsiness and> alopecia…”The article reports that the most common adverse effects of isoniazid aregastrointestinal, which is a clear indication of its innate toxicity. However,the treatment for LTBI is usually a regimen that involves a combination ofdrugs, mainly isoniazid, rifapentine and rifampicin, that are claimed to reducethe risk of developing active TB disease by about 60 per cent. The reason thatthey are used in combinations is based on the idea that TB bacteria havedeveloped ‘resistance’ to certain drugs when used individually. However, the TBReport makes the important statement that,> “…safety concerns exist, mainly related to the development of hepatotoxicity.”The recognition that antibiotics cause liver damage is a matter of seriousconcern, especially for an infection that is said to lead to active disease inonly 5 to 15 per cent of cases. Furthermore, damage to the liver means that thebody’s ability to process and eliminate toxins has been severely impaired; thiscan only lead to worsening health problems. The efforts to address the problemof ‘latent TB’ are based on the notion that ‘reactivation TB’, which is thedevelopment of active disease, accounts for the greatest number of new cases inregions with low prevalence. In regions where there is a high prevalence oftuberculosis, the medical establishment concentrates its efforts oninterventions that involve the treatment of the disease, on the basis that,according to the TB Report,> “Most deaths from TB could be prevented with early diagnosis and appropriate> treatment.”The TB Report also claims that approximately 53 million deaths were avertedbetween 2000 and 2016 due to ‘successful’ treatment, but adds that,> “…there are still large gaps in detection and treatment.”The efforts to fill these ‘gaps’ will produce yet another massive boost to theprofits of the pharmaceutical industry, but they will not enable people to berestored to health.The claims of the successful treatment of TB and of the millions of lives thathave been saved, must be contrasted with the increasing incidence of ‘drugresistance’ and the condition referred to as MDR-TB, which is described in theWHO fact sheet that states,> “Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) remains a public health crisis and a health> security threat.”The fact sheet claims that MDR-TB is caused by,> “…bacteria that do not respond to isoniazid and rifampicin…”Rifampicin is another common antibiotic used to treat TB. Although the factsheet refers to MDR-TB as ‘treatable’, the success rate of treatment is admittedto be only about 54 per cent, which is unsurprising considering that thesetreatments involve drugs of even greater toxicity that are used over an extendedperiod, often up to two years. The unsuccessful treatment of MDR-TB is alsoclaimed to be due to ‘drug resistance’ and assigned the label XDR-TB(extensively drug-resistant TB). The success rate of the treatment for XDR-TBis, however, even lower at only 30 per cent; but this should not be surprisingeither, considering that it involves treatment with extremely toxic drugs.It should be clear that the failure to ‘cure’ tuberculosis is not becausebacteria have developed ‘resistance’ to the drugs. The reason for the failure ofthese treatments is because they are based on a fatally flawed theory that TB iscaused by a bacterium that needs to be killed with toxic drugs. Tuberculosis, incommon with all other diseases, is poorly understood; this has been admitted inthe previously cited 2011 article entitled Tuberculosis: Current Situation,Challenges and Overview of its Control Programmes in India that states,> “Even though tubercle bacilli were identified nearly 130 years ago, a> definitive understanding of pathogenesis of this disease is still defective.”There are clearly many factors that can contribute to the pulmonary conditiondiagnosed as tuberculosis; some of these were discussed in chapter four. One ofthese factors relates to the statement in the fact sheet that people with LTBIare more likely to develop ‘active disease’ if they also have diabetes. Thepreviously cited 2009 article entitled Tuberculosis and diabetes mellitus:convergence of two epidemics, referred to in the discussion in chapter six aboutsugar, states that,> “The link between diabetes mellitus and tuberculosis has been recognised for> centuries.”Although the article refers to ‘industrialisation’ and ‘urbanisation’ as factorsthat lead to increased rates of obesity and diabetes, it also states that,> “Several studies show that coaffliction with tuberculosis and diabetes> mellitus is common both in low-income and high-income countries.”The idea that the onset of a disease is related to the income level of thecountry in which a person lives is highly misleading; a person’s state of healthis directly related to a number of factors that include their personalcircumstances, their diet and the external influences to which they are exposed.The importance of diet is discussed further in chapter ten, but the consumptionof processed foods containing large quantities of refined sugar is directlyrelated to diabetes, as has been discussed. Previous discussions have alsoindicated that toxic substances contribute to the development of tuberculosisand that refined sugar is a toxic substance that has been described as ‘thesweetest poison of all’. This means that it should not be surprising to find thecoexistence of TB and diabetes mellitus (DM); a situation that has been found tooccur in India, as discussed in an October 2012 article entitled High DiabetesPrevalence among Tuberculosis Cases in Kerala, India that states,> “India, the nation with the highest number of TB cases in the world, is also> undergoing epidemic growth in DM rates.”Although India is said to have the largest number of TB cases, it should benoted that India has the second largest population, which, in early 2018, isreported at approximately 1.354 billion people; a population size that is onlyexceeded by China, which has approximately 1.415 billion inhabitants and isreported to have the second largest number of new TB cases.There is a long history of sugar consumption in India, which provides a partialexplanation for the long history of tuberculosis in that country. According to a2014 article entitled Sugar Intake, Obesity and Diabetes in India, India is notonly the second largest producer, it is also the largest consumer of sugar.However, sugar is not the only factor that is involved in the development ofboth TB and diabetes.The increased influence of the food industry through vast advertising andmarketing campaigns in the widespread promotion of manufactured food productsand drinks, referred to as ‘fast foods’, have changed the eating habits of largenumbers of people in many ‘developing’ countries. Some people have abandonedtheir traditional foods and replaced them with processed foods and drinks,which, although cheaper, have been shown to contain a variety of toxic foodadditives, in addition to sugar.Tuberculosis, as has been discussed, is largely a condition that results from anaccumulation of toxins that need to be expelled from the body. When toxinscannot be easily eliminated through the normal processes that involve the liverand kidneys, the lungs provide assistance as an additional channel, as Dr Bielerhas explained.MalariaThe establishment definition of malaria refers to,> “an infectious disease due to the presence of parasitic protozoa of the genus> Plasmodium within the red blood cells. The disease is transmitted by the> Anopheles mosquito and is confined mainly to tropical and sub-tropical areas.”Malaria is another of the ‘epidemic’ diseases specifically referred to in SDG3.3 that are to be ‘ended’ by 2030. Although the definition refers to malaria as‘infectious’, it is not transmissible between people; it is, however, consideredto be a major health problem, as indicated by the March 2019 WHO fact sheetentitled Malaria that states,> “In 2017, there were an estimated 219 million cases of malaria in 87> countries.”The fact sheet also reports that,> “The estimated number of malaria deaths stood at 435,000 in 2017.”It is interesting to note that both of these statistics refer to ‘estimated’numbers.Although malaria is reported to kill fewer people than TB or ‘HIV’, it isnevertheless said to pose an extremely serious threat to billions of people, asthe fact sheet claims,> “In 2017, nearly half of the world’s population was at risk of malaria.”The people considered to be most ‘at risk’ are those who live in ‘developing’countries, especially African countries, as the fact sheet indicates,> “The WHO African Region carries a disproportionately high share of the global> malaria burden. In 2017, the region was home to 92% of malaria cases and 93%> of malaria deaths.”The acknowledged paucity of available data with respect to disease morbidity andmortality in ‘developing’ countries raises serious questions about the veracityof the WHO statistics relating to malaria, even though they are admitted to beestimated. Furthermore, a close examination of the ‘information’ about malariapromulgated by the medical establishment, and widely accepted as ‘fact’, revealsthe existence of many anomalous claims. Together, these anomalies pose apowerful challenge to the veracity of these ‘facts’ and provide a compellingargument that the ‘malaria theory’ is seriously, if not fatally, flawed; as thefollowing discussion will demonstrate.According to the fact sheet,> “Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites. The parasites are spread to people> through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes, called ‘malaria> vectors’.”This claim highlights two major anomalies. The first is that Anophelesmosquitoes inhabit every continent with the sole exception of Antarctica; thesecond is that the Plasmodium parasites claimed to be transmitted by thesemosquitoes are also ubiquitous on every continent, except for Antarctica. Yetmalaria is said to be largely ‘confined’ to tropical and sub-tropical regions.One attempt to explain this anomaly is the idea that malaria is not transmittedby all species of Anopheles mosquito; as indicated by a 2015 article entitledHighly evolvable malaria vectors: the genomes of 16 anopheles mosquitoes, whichstates that Plasmodium parasites,> “…are transmitted by approximately 60 of the 450 known species of anopheline> mosquitoes.”More significantly, however, the article states that although Anopheles is theonly genus of mosquito that transmits malaria,> “…not…even all members of each vector species are efficient malaria vectors.”This does not, however, explain the anomalies referred to above. The admissionthat they are not all ‘efficient’ malaria vectors’ casts serious doubt on theclaim that disease transmission only requires a female mosquito to have been‘infected’ with the parasite for her to be able to transmit the disease. Furtherdoubts are cast on the basic theory by a January 2017 article entitledProbability of Transmission of Malaria from Mosquito to Human is Regulated byMosquito Density in Naïve and Vaccinated Hosts. The article states that theprevailing assumption is that ‘infected’ mosquitoes are equally ‘infectious’,but adds that,> “…this has never been rigorously tested.”The article refers to scientific findings that claim the greater the number ofparasites, the more likely the ‘infected’ mosquito will transmit disease; butthis does not correspond to the underlying theory, as expressed in thedefinition, which states that ‘disease’ is caused by the presence of parasitesin the blood; it does not state that disease is caused by a specificconcentration of parasites in the blood.Malaria is a disease that is said to have existed for many thousands of years;historical records that are claimed to describe malaria refer to two mainsymptoms; fever and an enlarged spleen. Malaria has also been known by othernames, most notably marsh fever and ague, all of which have been recorded tohave occurred in various parts of the world, including many regions that areneither tropical nor sub-tropical.One particularly notable example is an area in the east of England, stillreferred to as the Fens, which, in the past, was extensively covered by marshes.A 2014 article entitled Malaria in the UK states that,> “From the 15th century, malaria was endemic along the coasts and marshlands of> South-East England, Fenlands and Northern England.”England is neither tropical nor sub-tropical; however, of even greatersignificance is that malaria was endemic in England during the era referred toas the ‘Little Ice Age’; a period in which the winter temperatures in Englandwere substantially colder than they are in the early 21st century. Surprisingly,this is admitted on a CDC web page entitled From Shakespeare to Defoe: Malariain England in the Little Ice Age that states,> “From 1564 to the 1730s – the coldest period of the Little Ice Age – malaria> was an important cause of illness and death in several parts of England.”However, the CDC web page entitled Where Malaria Occurs states that,> “Temperature is particularly critical.”The reason for this is, according to the CDC, because the parasite cannot betransmitted at temperatures below 20 degrees C (68 degrees F). Yet thetemperatures during the Little Ice Age were substantially colder, especiallyduring the winters when the River Thames was covered by a sufficiently thicklayer of ice that it enabled ‘frost fairs’ to take place. However, despite therecognition that malaria occurred in England during this extremely cold period,the CDC page claims that,> “Malaria is transmitted in tropical and subtropical areas...”The English climate in the 21st century is far warmer than that of the ‘LittleIce Age’, yet malaria is claimed to no longer occur in England; as the UK NHSwebsite clearly states,> “Malaria is not found in the UK.”Nevertheless, despite the extensive drainage programmes conducted during the17th century, some marshes still cover parts of eastern England and Anophelesmosquitoes are still resident in England. Yet a 2014 article entitled Study: UKcities becoming mosquito-friendly habitats makes the bold claim that,> “UK mosquitoes are human disease-free…”It may be assumed from this claim that the Anopheles mosquitoes that currentlyreside in England belong to the many species that do not transmit malaria, butthis assumption ignores the claim that malaria was endemic in England, whichmeans therefore that ‘malarial mosquitoes’ must have been present at that time.Although the marshes were partially drained, it is unrealistic to assume thatevery single ‘malaria-carrying’ mosquito and all of their parasites would havebeen destroyed during these drainage programmes. This means that ‘UKmosquitoes’, or at least some of them, must be descendants of ‘malarialmosquitoes’; which raises the question of why malaria is claimed to not be foundin the UK.Of greater concern is that the article refers to one of the study authors who iscited to state that,> “…the Anopheles mosquito we found is a human-biting species and it can> transmit malaria.”Although UK mosquitoes are said to be ‘disease-free’, the study authors arereported to state that an outbreak of malaria in the UK is ‘possible’ if thedisease is brought into the country. But no explanation is offered for how theUK’s human-biting mosquitoes lost their disease-causing parasites or theirability to transmit malaria.America is another country where malaria has occurred in the past but has beeneradicated, despite the continuing presence of Anopheles mosquitoes. The CDC webpage entitled Elimination of Malaria in the United States (1947-1951) claimsthat this was achieved through a programme that,> “…consisted primarily of DDT applications to the interior surfaces of rural> homes...”The CDC reports that more than 4 million homes in the US had been sprayed duringthe 4-year period and adds that the programme also included,> “...drainage, removal of mosquito breeding sites and spraying (occasionally> from aircraft) of insecticides.”Malaria is also reported to have occurred in Europe but to have been similarly‘eradicated’ during the 20th century; as indicated by a June 2016 articleentitled Malaria in Europe: emerging threat or minor nuisance? that states,> “Malaria was eradicated from Europe in the 1970s…”The article claims that the measures responsible for this ‘success’ involved,> “…a combination of insecticide spraying, drug therapy and environmental> engineering.”These are virtually the same measures as those employed by the English andAmerican programmes; however, the article makes a revealing comment, which isthat,> “Several Anopheles species capable of transmitting malaria occur widely all> over Europe.”Yet again, although malaria is referred to as having been ‘eradicated’, themosquitoes capable of transmitting the disease have not been completelyannihilated. The likelihood that every single Plasmodium parasite was destroyedduring eradication campaigns that failed to destroy every single mosquito iszero. The fact that mosquito species capable of transmitting malaria stillinhabit England, America and Europe means that some must still be ‘infected’with the parasite. The claim that the disease has been eradicated from theseparts of the world is therefore highly anomalous. The article attempts toexplain the anomaly and states that,> “In time, anopheline numbers recovered, giving rise to a phenomenon known as> ‘anophelism without malaria’, which essentially means that anopheline> mosquitoes are present in formerly malarious areas of Europe where malaria no> longer occurs.”The phenomenon of ‘anophelism without malaria’ bears a close resemblance to thatof ‘latent TB infection’; but these phenomena are not merely anomalous, theyrepresent serious contradictions to the underlying theories about thesediseases. Previous discussions have exposed the erroneous nature of theoriesrelating to TB, which strongly suggests that there is a similarly serious andfundamental problem with the theory about malaria, which claims that it iscaused by Plasmodium parasites that are transmitted to humans by Anophelesmosquitoes.The previously cited 2014 article entitled Malaria’s contribution to World WarOne – the unexpected adversary states that Europe experienced a resurgence incases of malaria during the war years and that this was due to,> “Deployment of large numbers of troops from tropical Africa and India…”The article claims that malaria was ‘spread’ to civilians by these troops, butthis is misleading as malaria is not directly transmissible between people; itrequires the intervention of a ‘vector’.Malarial parasites are said to be transmitted to humans by ‘infected’ femalemosquitoes and that transmission occurs during a blood ‘meal’, but the use ofthe word ‘meal’ is misleading. Male and female mosquitoes both ‘feed’ on plantnectar; the reason that female mosquitoes draw blood, whether from humans oranimals, is to incubate her eggs. It is claimed that female mosquitoes are born‘parasite-free’ but they become ‘infected’ through the ingestion of a parasitein their first ‘blood meal’ drawn from an infected person. Once ‘infected’,female mosquitoes transmit the parasites to humans, or other animals, throughtheir salivary glands whenever they subsequently draw blood. The seeminglysimple nature of this explanation conceals the extremely complicated nature ofthe processes claimed to be involved.Malarial parasites belong to the genus Plasmodium, of which there are more than100 species, although the WHO fact sheet states that only 5 of these speciescause malaria in humans. It is, however, the complex nature of the life cycle ofthese parasites that poses one of the major challenges to the underlying theoryabout the development of malaria. A web page entitled Life Cycle states that,> “The malaria parasite has a complex, multistage life cycle occurring within> two living beings, the vector mosquito and the vertebrate host.”The life cycles of the different Plasmodium species claimed to infect humans arenot identical; two species are said to produce ‘hypnozoites’ that may liedormant and harmless in the liver, whereas a third species does not producehypnozoites. The idea that allegedly ‘pathogenic’ parasites can lie dormant andharmless in the liver is anomalous; but it is not the most significant anomaly.The main anomalies arise from the explanations about the processes involved inthe transmission of ‘infection’ between the mosquito vector and the human hostand about the different stages of the parasite’s life cycle in both mosquitoesand humans.Malaria is said to result from a bite from a female Anopheles mosquito infectedwith a Plasmodium parasite; however, because female mosquitoes are born withoutparasites they therefore need to ‘acquire’ them, which is said to occur when shetakes her first ‘blood meal’. This is, however, an overly simplisticexplanation. Firstly, it ignores the fact that each mosquito can only draw a fewdrops of blood, yet this tiny quantity is said to contain an ‘infective’parasite. Secondly, the parasite must be at exactly the ‘right’ stage of itshighly complex life-cycle and be delivered by the body’s moving bloodstream tothe exact part of the body that the mosquito intends to bite. Furthermore, oncethe mosquito has drawn blood and been ‘infected’ with the parasite, it plays‘host’ to the next stage of the parasite’s complex life-cycle. When this stagehas been completed, the mosquito obligingly assists the parasite again bytransferring it into a human host when taking her next blood ‘meal’.The stages of the parasite life-cycle that are said to occur within the humanhost are even more complex; a diagram of the entire parasite life-cycle isavailable on the CDC web page entitled Biology in the series of pages entitledAbout Malaria. One particularly interesting comment on the page is that,> “Differently from the human host, the mosquito vector does not suffer from the> presence of the parasites.”The idea that a minute parasite can cause serious harm and even death to thelarger of the two organisms, whilst the smaller organism is entirely unaffected,remains unexplained. Also problematic is the idea a parasite initiates processesthat can damage or even kill its host, because the purpose of inhabiting thehuman body is said to be to progress its life-cycle.The CDC claim that mosquitoes are not affected by parasites is, however,contradicted by a September 2010 article entitled How Mosquitoes Fight Malaria,which refers to a study conducted at the NIAID that discovered some mosquitoesdo succumb to the parasites, but that others can ‘fight’ the infection; yet thearticle also states that,> “…researchers don’t know exactly how insects do this.”The development of disease is said to result from the presence of parasites inthe blood, as indicated by the CDC Biology page that states,> “Blood stage parasites are responsible for the clinical manifestations of the> disease.”Although this may seem to explain why the ‘liver stage’ does not producesymptoms, it would be a mistake to make this assumption; the liver is the mostimportant organ of elimination that assists detoxification, as has beendiscussed.The ‘disease’ stage of malaria is said to result from the release of thousandsof parasites into the bloodstream. However, although this may seem to be aserious level of ‘infection’, it must be noted that the human body is estimatedto contain approximately 20 trillion red blood cells. An analogy that puts thesehuge numbers into their true perspective is that a few thousand parasites within20 trillion red blood cells is as insignificant as one day in approximately600,000 years.The fact that thousands of ‘infected’ cells are insignificant compared to thetotal number of red blood cells, raises the extremely important question of howso few ‘infected’ cells can produce such a serious disease. Another equallyimportant question it raises is the likelihood that a female Anopheles mosquitowill ingest at least one ‘infected’ cell in the few drops of blood she draws.The probability is extremely low.An interesting revelation is made in a 2010 article entitled History of thediscovery of the malaria parasites and their vectors, which states that,> “...apart from the initial discovery of parasites in the blood, every> subsequent discovery has been based on studies on non-human malaria parasites> and related organisms.”The article explains that the discovery of malaria was originally the result ofobservations made by Alphonse Laveran, a French army officer. Early theoriesabout malaria included suggestions that it was caused by a bacterium that hadbeen shown to produce fevers and enlarged spleens when injected into rabbits.However, the bacterial cause of malaria was abandoned when Alphonse Laverandiscovered granules of black pigment in the spleens of people diagnosed withmalaria; he regarded these pigments as specific to malaria. The article statesthat Alphonse Laveran had observed,> “...several different forms of erythrocytic organism, including crescents,> spherical motionless bodies with pigment, spherical moving bodies with> pigment...”His observations led to the discovery that these ‘organisms’ were protozoa, notbacteria; but, due to the belief, both then and now, that the blood is a sterileenvironment and therefore free from any type of ‘contaminant’, it was assumedthat the presence of these ‘bodies’ meant that the blood had been invaded. Thebelief that blood is a ‘sterile’ environment is however, erroneous. Thediscussion about protozoa in chapter three referred to a July 2011 article whichincludes a statement that bears repetition,> “…many people infected with known parasites…are asymptomatic.”The WHO World Malaria Report 2018, which will be referred to as the MalariaReport, states that,> “Patients with suspected malaria should have prompt parasitological> confirmation of diagnosis, with either microscopy or RDT before antimalarial> treatment is started.”RDTs are rapid diagnostic tests. It is claimed that microscopy is the ‘goldstandard’ test but the cost of the necessary equipment to process the tests isprohibitive for many ‘developing’ countries, especially in ‘poor’ sub-SaharanAfrican countries where malaria is said to be most prevalent. As with the RDTsused for ‘HIV’, those for malaria do not detect the actual parasite; they areclaimed to detect antigens said to be specific to the parasite that the body hasproduced in response to a prior infection. However, as previously discussed, thepresence of antibodies is interpreted in two different ways. One is that theyindicate immunity; the other is that they indicate disease. Although mutuallyexclusive, these interpretations are both incorrect.Although tests are recommended by the WHO as a method of determining whether aperson has been ‘infected’, a 2002 article entitled Rapid Diagnostic Tests forMalaria Parasites makes a significant observation that,> “Malaria presents a diagnostic challenge to laboratories in most countries.”This applies to all types of test; even so-called ‘gold standard’ microscopytests are not without their difficulties. On the English translation pages ofthe website based on an Italian book entitled Atlas of Human Malaria is a pageentitled Artifacts that may be confused with malaria or other blood parasites,which begins with the interesting comment that,> “Inexperienced microscopists may have difficulty in examining thin and> especially thick film because of contaminating elements that can be> accidentally present in stained samples.”The types of ‘contaminants’ to which the book refers include: bacteria, skindirt, vegetable spores, yeasts or moulds in the air. The reference to bacteriaas ‘contaminants’ reveals the authors’ belief in the ‘germ theory’; however,they make another revealing comment, which is that,> “The presence of malaria parasites in a blood sample is an indication of> infection, but not necessarily of disease.”The presence of ‘infection’ by parasites in the absence of disease is alsoacknowledged on the CDC web page entitled Malaria Diagnosis (United States) thatstates,> “In some malaria-endemic areas, malaria transmission is so intense that a> large proportion of the population is infected but not made ill by the> parasites.”The idea that a person can be ‘infected’ with parasites without experiencing anyill-effects contradicts the definition of malaria which states that it is causedby the presence of parasites in the blood. One of the ‘explanations’ offered forthis phenomenon is that some people have developed ‘immunity’, or at least‘partial immunity’; this point is addressed by the statement in the Atlas ofHuman Malaria book that,> “Individuals who live in malaria endemic areas and are subject to repeat> plasmodium infection develop a special type of immunity...”This comment is supported by the WHO Malaria fact sheet that states,> “Human immunity is another important factor, especially among adults in areas> of moderate or intense transmission conditions.”The fact sheet also states that,> “Partial immunity is developed over years of exposure…”This is all highly anomalous; the mechanism by which people develop ‘immunity’,whether partial or otherwise, is inadequately explained, but there are clearsimilarities with the anomalous claims about immunity to ‘infectious diseases’.The failure of the medical establishment to provide plausible explanations forthese anomalies is due to their poor level of understanding about the mechanismsinvolved; as indicated by a 2009 article entitled Acquired Immunity to Malariathat refers to the protection offered by ‘naturally acquired immunity’ but addsthat,> “There is no clear concept about how this protection works.”The previously cited 2010 article about the history of the discovery of themalaria parasite provides a description of the symptoms associated with theillness regarded as the early form of malaria,> “The early Greeks...were well aware of the characteristic poor health,> malarial fevers and enlarged spleens seen in people living in marshy places.”This view is supported by the writings of the Greek physician Hippocrates,particularly in his work entitled On Airs, Waters and Places, in which he refersto the waters in marshes and states that,> “...those who drink them have large and obstructed spleens, their bellies are> hard, emaciated and hot...”Fever and an enlarged spleen remain two of the symptoms associated with malaria;fever is regarded as a symptom of the acute form of malaria, whereas an enlargedspleen is a symptom of the chronic form of the disease.It is claimed that one of the functions attributed to the spleen is to defendthe body against ‘pathogens’, which indicates that it would also be involved indefending the body against parasites. The main functions of the spleen includecleaning the blood and removing ‘abnormal’ red blood cells, which indicates thatthe spleen would be involved in the processes that remove red blood cells thathave been ‘infected’ by parasites. It should be noted that red blood cells arenot long-lived; their lifespan is approximately 120 days, which means that thedeath and removal of RBCs from the body is a normal and ongoing process. Themalaria fact sheet describes the symptoms of acute malaria,> “The first symptoms – fever, headache, and chills – may be mild and difficult> to recognize as malaria.”In a ‘Western’ country, these symptoms are more likely to be regarded as a coldor the ‘flu’. In other countries, especially those referred to as ‘developing’,these symptoms are likely to be regarded as ‘malaria’ that would need to beconfirmed by a test, the accuracy of which is questionable.Malaria has been particularly associated with Africa since Europeans began toexplore the continent in the 19th century; one of the most famous explorers wasDavid Livingstone, a medical doctor. A 2013 article entitled What is DavidLivingstone’s legacy, 200 years after his birth? contains an extract from hiswritings, in which Dr Livingstone is claimed to have stated,> “I have drunk water swarming with insects, thick with mud and putrid with> rhinoceros urine and buffaloes’ dung, and no stinted drafts of either.”These contaminants are more than capable of producing severe illness andsymptoms such as fevers and an enlarged spleen. However, Dr Livingstone was aconventional medical doctor and a keen proponent of the use of ‘medicines’ forthe treatment of diseases, including malaria with which he is claimed to havesuffered. One of the earliest ‘medicines’ used as a preventive for ‘malaria’ wasquinine, the ‘medicine’ with which Doctor Livingstone treated his own illness.Quinine was first isolated by chemists in the early 19th century; it is anactive substance of the cinchona bark, a plant native to South America. Itremained one of the main ‘medicines’ for the treatment of malaria for more thana century; as indicated by the previously cited article about malaria during WWIthat states,> “Clinical treatment primarily depended on quinine, although efficacy was> poor…”This poor level of efficacy is claimed to be because different malarialparasites are said to require different treatments; but this idea ignores themore important fact, which is that quinine is toxic. In Natural Hygiene: Man’sPristine Way of Life, Herbert Shelton refers to quinine as a ‘protoplasmicpoison’ and states that,> “Untold thousands of nervous systems have been wrecked by quinine; deafness> and blindness have been caused by it and no case of malaria was ever cured by> it...”He adds that quinine substitutes are equally unsuccessful in their ability toeither prevent or cure malaria.The medical establishment does not dispute that quinine is toxic; it isacknowledged to be associated with hepatotoxicity; a clear indication of itsinherently toxic nature. The article about malaria during WWI states thatquinine was not the only ‘medicine’ used in the treatment of malaria during thatperiod and refers to other ‘medicines’ that contained either arsenic orstrychnine. The ‘effects’ of arsenic have been discussed; it is howeverimportant to note that they include vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain aswell as anaemia. Strychnine is also highly toxic; it can produce adverse effectsin the central nervous system, painful muscle spasms and death from respiratoryarrest.Interestingly, another effect of arsenic poisoning is referred to as ‘blackwater urine’. This effect is also associated with a condition known as‘Blackwater Fever’, which is claimed to be a ‘complication’ of malaria. Theestablishment definition of blackwater fever states that,> “The condition is probably brought on by inadequate treatment with quinine…”It is however, far more likely that ‘blackwater fever’ occurs due to thetreatment of malaria with quinine, rather than ‘inadequate’ treatment with thistoxic substance; quinine-based drugs are associated with severe adverse effects,as the CDC admits,> “Overdose of anti-malarial drugs, particularly chloroquine, can be fatal.”Chloroquine is a derivative of quinine.The medical establishment claims that ‘treatment’ is nevertheless essential, asindicated by the Malaria Report that states,> “Prompt diagnosis and treatment is the most effective way to prevent a mild> case of malaria from developing into severe disease and death.”The report also recognises the reduced efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) and advisesthat,> “Where there is a high treatment failure rate with CQ (>10%), countries are> encouraged to change their first-line treatment to an ACT.”ACT refers to artemisinin-based combination therapy.Chloroquine had been the main treatment for malaria until relatively recently,but, according to a 2012 article entitled Diagnosis of Malaria Infection with orwithout Disease, it has become,> “…increasingly ineffective against Plasmodium falciparum due to the spread of> selected resistant strains.”Artemisinin is a synthetic chemical derived from sweet wormwood; the ‘natural’and synthetic substances are both associated with nausea and vomiting, whichindicates that the body regards them both as toxic. Nevertheless, artemisinin isconsidered to be highly effective against malaria; it is claimed to reduce theconcentration of the ‘blood-stage’ parasites that cause disease. The reason thatartemisinin is used in combination with other drugs is because it has a shorthalf-life of about one hour in the human body; the longer-lasting drugs, withwhich it is combined include: amodiaquine, mefloquine andsulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, all of which are associated with adverse ‘sideeffects’. Amodiaquine has been linked to hepatotoxicity; mefloquine has beenfound to cause brain damage. The ‘side effects’ associated withSulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) include nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.The Malaria fact sheet claims that certain groups are at a ‘considerably higherrisk’ of developing malaria than others and states that,> “These include infants, children under 5 years of age, pregnant women and> patients with HIV/AIDS, as well as non-immune migrants, mobile populations and> travellers.”It is considered that infants, children under the age of five and pregnant womenare those at greatest risk, although their increased risk of contracting malariais not explained. Nevertheless, this ‘risk’ is given as the justification forthe use of toxic drugs as interventions claimed to be necessary for theachievement of the goal to end the ‘epidemic’ of malaria.In areas where malaria transmission is said to be moderate or high, the WHOrecommends that IPTp (intermittent preventive treatment of pregnant women) withSP is introduced and administered during scheduled antenatal clinicappointments. However, SP is not administered during the first trimester as ithas been associated with teratogenic effects when taken during this stage ofpregnancy. The WHO also recommends that, in these areas, infants and childrenbetween the ages of 3 and 59 months should receive SP for IPTi (intermittentpreventive treatment for infants). It is said that these treatments can beadministered during scheduled visits to immunisation clinics. The simultaneousadministration of toxic ‘medicines’ and toxic vaccines will invariably produce avariety of adverse effects, even if some of them are not immediately noticeable.In areas where seasonal transmission of malaria is claimed to be high, which issaid to occur in areas of the Sahel sub-region of Africa, the WHO recommends SMC(seasonal malaria chemoprevention) as an ‘additional prevention strategy’. Thefact sheet describes this strategy and states that it involves,> “…the administration of monthly courses of amodiaquine plus> sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine to all children under 5 years of age during the> high transmission season.”These drugs are not administered during visits to immunisation clinics;according to the Malaria Report,> “Implementation of SMC was scaled up from 2015, and delivery is primarily> door-to-door in most countries…”It is reported that Plasmodium falciparum has also begun to develop resistanceto artemisinin-based ‘medicines’. ‘Resistance’ in this context is said to meanthat there is a noticeable reduction in the rate that parasites are cleared fromthe blood, on the basis that their presence in the blood is indicative ofdisease; but this has been shown to not always be the case.Although malaria is not an ‘infectious disease’, it is claimed that a person candevelop ‘immunity’ to the disease; this has clearly been one of the reasons thatthe pharmaceutical industry has been encouraged to develop a vaccine that wouldinduce an ‘immune response’ to the malaria parasites. To date, only one vaccinehas made progress through various stages of testing; the Malaria fact sheetstates that,> “RTS,S/AS01 (RTS,S) is the first and, to date, the only vaccine to show> partial protection against malaria in young children.”The WHO page entitled Q&A on the malaria vaccine implementation programme (MVIP)claims that this vaccine has been shown in trials to be ‘well tolerated’, eventhough it is associated with the ‘usual’ adverse reactions that include pain andswelling at the site, as well as fever. However, RTS,S is also associated withsome more serious adverse effects, as admitted on the Q&A page that states,> “During the Phase 3 trial, an increased risk of febrile seizures was seen> within 7 days of the administration of any of the RTS,S vaccine doses.”Nevertheless, the fact sheet states that this vaccine is to be introduced intothree countries in 2019; these are Ghana, Kenya and Malawi. In common with allother vaccines, the RTS,S will contain toxic ingredients, such as adjuvants andpreservatives. Furthermore, on the basis that no vaccine has been proven to beeither safe or effective, the malaria vaccine will be no exception; like allother vaccines, it will induce serious adverse health effects, in addition tofebrile seizures, for the young children in the three African countries in whichit is to be introduced.The strategies recommended for the eradication of malaria also involve methodsto destroy the mosquito; these methods are referred to as ‘vector control’ andentail the use of pesticides for two applications; insecticide-treated mosquitonets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) with insecticides. The class ofinsecticides most commonly used for ITNs are pyrethroids, which have beendiscussed and shown to be highly toxic; as indicated by the Beyond Pesticidesfact sheet that states,> “While pyrethroids are a synthetic version of an extract from the> chrysanthemum, they were chemically designed to be more toxic with longer> breakdown times, and are often formulated with synergists, increasing potency> and compromising the human body’s ability to detoxify the pesticide.”There is a clear potential for serious health problems to occur as the result ofexposures to toxic pyrethroids for adults and children who sleep under thetreated nets. The main concern of the WHO would seem to be that the insects andparasites are developing ‘resistance’ to these chemicals, as indicated by theMalaria Report that states,> “Resistance to pyrethroids – the only insecticide class currently used in ITNs> – is widespread…”Three other classes of insecticides are also used in malaria vector control,although they are mainly used for indoor residual spraying (IRS); theseinsecticides are carbamates, organophosphates and organochlorines. Carbamateshave a similar mechanism of action to organophosphates and therefore producesimilar adverse health effects; the toxicity of organochlorines andorganophosphates have been discussed. It should be noted that one of theorganochlorines used for IRS is DDT.The toxic ‘medicines’ used to kill parasites in the human body and the toxicinsecticides used to kill the mosquitoes that transmit parasites have clearlyfailed to ‘control’ the disease; the use of even stronger chemicals, whether as‘medicines’, insecticides or vaccines, will similarly fail to solve the problem.It is clear that the ‘malaria theory’ contains many anomalies, not least ofwhich is that the presence of the parasites, the purported causal agent of thedisease, is not necessarily accompanied by disease. These anomalies arestrikingly similar to those of all other ‘infectious diseases’ and show that the‘malaria theory’ is similarly erroneous; this, in turn, raises serious questionsabout a number of other diseases claimed to be caused by parasites.Neglected Tropical DiseasesSDG 3 of the 2030 Agenda includes the aim to end the epidemic of neglectedtropical diseases (NTDs), which are described on the WHO web page entitledNeglected Tropical Diseases as,> “…a diverse group of communicable diseases that prevail in tropical or> subtropical conditions in 149 countries…”Although referred to as ‘neglected’, these diseases do not have an insignificantimpact; the page states that they,> “…affect more than one billion people and cost developing economies billions> of dollars every year.”In common with many of the ‘communicable’ diseases that are claimed to beprevalent in tropical or subtropical regions, NTDs are said to mainly affectcertain sectors of the population; as the page also states,> “Populations living in poverty, without adequate sanitation and in close> contact with infectious vectors and domestic animals and livestock are those> worst affected.”It is claimed that one of the reasons that ‘infectious agents’ invade the humanbody is to facilitate microbial replication; this does not however, explain thereason that microbes prefer to invade the bodies of poor people who live inunhygienic conditions.The microorganisms claimed to be the main causes of neglected tropical diseasesare bacteria, fungi and protozoa.However, bacteria, fungi and protozoa are also the microorganisms that comprisethe body’s normal microbial inhabitants. The 4th edition of a leading cellbiology textbook, entitled Molecular Biology of the Cell, contains a chapterentitled Pathogens, Infection and Innate Immunity, which refers to the humanbody as a complex ecosystem that,> “…contains about 1013 human cells and also about 1014 bacterial, fungal, and> protozoan cells, which represent thousands of microbial species.”The book describes these microbial species as the body’s ‘normal flora’ andstates that,> “Pathogens are usually distinct from the normal flora.”One of the main differences between the body’s normal flora and pathogens isthat the latter are claimed to be invading microbes that cause disease. Althoughthe body’s normal microbial inhabitants are claimed to be harmless and evenbeneficial, the book indicates that, under certain conditions, they may becomeharmful,> “Our normal microbial inhabitants only cause trouble if our immune systems are> weakened…”The reason that the body’s normal flora would alter their normal functioning tobecome harmful is not explained.The book claims that a weakened immune system is not necessary for ‘pathogens’to be able to cause disease; as indicated by the statement that,> “…dedicated pathogens do not require that the host be immunocompromised or> injured.”This statement is not, however, consistent with the information provided by the2011 article about microbial eukaryotes, previously cited in chapter three,which states that,> “Opportunistic parasites are a significant source of morbidity in immune> compromised patients, although these same taxa may be present in healthy> people without apparent consequence.”The presence of these ‘parasites’ in the absence of symptoms is not consistentwith the claim that they are a source of morbidity.These inconsistencies further demonstrate the problems inherent within the ‘germtheory’ that remain unexplained by the medical establishment. The rigidadherence to the belief that microorganisms are ‘germs’ that invade the body andcause disease remains a serious obstacle to efforts to address human healthproblems.One of the main consequences of the perpetuation of this erroneous belief is theimplementation of strategies to destroy microorganisms and, where appropriate,the vectors claimed to transmit them. The inappropriate nature of thesestrategies and their inability to address the genuine health problems of peopleclaimed to be affected by neglected tropical diseases are discussed in thefollowing sections.LeprosyLeprosy is one of the ‘bacterial’ diseases included on the WHO list of NTDs; thediscussion in chapter four demonstrated that historically leprosy was notconfined to tropical regions of the world. The March 2019 WHO fact sheetentitled Leprosy claims that the disease was eliminated as a ‘public healthproblem’ in the year 2000, although it is said to still affect many people,> “There were 211,009 new leprosy cases registered globally in 2017…”The reason for a further discussion of this disease is due to the claim thatleprosy is prevalent in three ‘developing’ countries: namely Brazil, India andIndonesia. According to the Global Leprosy Strategy 2016-2020 report,> “Together, these three countries account for 81% of the newly diagnosed and> reported patients globally.”As previously discussed, the information promulgated by the medicalestablishment about leprosy contains many anomalies, one of which is thatMycobacterium leprae, the bacterium purported to be the cause of leprosy, issaid to be ‘slow multiplying’; M. leprae is also said to have a highly variableincubation period, as reported by the WHO fact sheet that states,> “Symptoms may occur within 1 year, but can also take as long as 20 years or> even more to occur.”This anomaly is not explained.Despite the assertion that leprosy is caused by M. leprae, this bacterium doesnot always cause disease and is not always accompanied by serious symptoms. Thepreviously cited November 2011 article about a leprosy vaccine includes astatement that deserves repetition,> “M. leprae infection does not always cause disease, and it is estimated that> anywhere between 30-75% of infections are spontaneously cleared without> causing significant symptoms.”This statement is another contradiction of the basic assumption of the ‘germtheory’ and is a violation of Koch’s first Postulate. Furthermore, the medicalestablishment admits to a poor level of understanding about leprosy; asindicated by the CDC page entitled Transmission that states,> “It is not known exactly how Hansen’s disease spreads between people.”Yet another anomaly is that, according to the CDC page,> “…more than 95% of all people have natural immunity to the disease.”It is, however, said to be curable, as the WHO fact sheet states,> “Leprosy is curable with multidrug therapy (MDT).”MDT involves three antibiotic drugs; namely, dapsone, rifampicin andclofazimine. There are said to be two forms of leprosy, referred to aspaucibacillary and multibacillary, each of which requires a slightly differentform of treatment. The WHO recommends that all leprosy patients receivetreatment with dapsone and rifampicin, but that patients with the multibacillaryform of the disease should also receive clofazimine in their treatment regimen.The reason that multiple drugs are used is because, as with all antibiotics, itis claimed that the bacteria have developed ‘resistance’ to them and that theyare therefore less effective when used individually.Dapsone was first introduced as a ‘breakthrough’ treatment for leprosy duringthe 1940s. Rifampicin is also used for the treatment of TB on the basis that M.Leprae closely resembles M. tuberculosis, even though these bacteria are said tobe responsible for two entirely different diseases with very different symptoms.In common with all other pharmaceutical drugs, these three antibiotics produce‘side effects’, or, more accurately, ‘effects’. Dapsone is associated withnausea, loss of appetite and liver inflammation; rifampicin is associated withhepatoxicity; and clofazimine with some skin effects, but also with nausea,vomiting and diarrhoea. These drugs are all toxic.The reference to leprosy as a ‘neglected’ disease would seem to be misleading;it certainly has not been neglected as far as the provision of treatment isconcerned; as the WHO fact sheet explains,> “Since 1995 WHO has provided MDT free of cost.”Leprosy is said to affect a number of different parts of the body; as the factsheet states,> “The disease mainly affects the skin, the peripheral nerves, mucosa of the> upper respiratory tract, and the eyes.”One of the most devastating effects associated with leprosy is nerve damage thatcan lead to numbness and even a total loss of feeling, which, when it occurs inthe hands and feet is referred to as ‘peripheral neuropathy’. A 2017 articleentitled Epidemiology of Peripheral Neuropathy: An Indian Perspective statesthat almost 60 per cent of the worldwide incidence of leprosy occurs in Indiaand that leprosy is the cause of most cases of neuropathy. More importantly, thearticle refers to a variety of factors that can also cause peripheralneuropathy; these include exposures to neurotoxic substances such as arsenic,lead and mercury. In addition to these ‘natural’ neurotoxins are many‘unnatural’ toxins; the article refers to,> “…different chemotherapeutic agents with a propensity to affect peripheral> nerves.”In other words, certain ‘medicines’ are neurotoxic and eminently capable ofcausing peripheral neuropathy.Leprosy is also said to affect the skin; one of these effects involves a loss ofskin pigmentation, also known as vitiligo, or leucoderma as it more formallycalled. A November 2000 article entitled High prevalence of vitiligo inlepromatous leprosy makes the interesting comment that,> “Vitiligo frequently occurs in lepromatous patients, an observation rarely> reported in the literature.”Although the cause of vitiligo is referred to as ‘unknown’, there are some knowncauses; as indicated by a 2010 article entitled Chemical leucoderma: Indianscenario, prognosis and treatment that states,> “Chemical leucoderma is an industrial disorder in developed countries and the> common causative chemicals are phenols and catechols.”Phenols and catechols are both petrochemical derivatives.It is inappropriate to refer to ‘chemical leucoderma’ as a problem restricted to‘developed’ countries; the continuing expansion of many industries, especiallythose that involve the use or manufacture of petrochemicals, into ‘developing’countries will be accompanied by the same occupational health problemsexperienced in ‘developed’ countries. Hazardous chemicals and industrialisationare discussed in the context of their relevance to ‘developing’ countries laterin this chapter. However, the use of the adjective ‘chemical’ to suggest thatthere is a separate form of leucoderma that can be caused by chemicals isinappropriate.The frequent, but rarely reported, co-occurrence of leucoderma and leprosyindicates that they are both associated with exposures to ‘chemicals’. Thisassociation is further supported by the comment in the article that a widevariety of chemicals are known to be toxic to melanocytes, the cells thatproduce the skin pigment melanin; these chemicals include mercury and arsenic,both of which are also associated with neuropathy, another symptom of ‘leprosy’.It is widely reported that the groundwater in many regions within the Indiansubcontinent is contaminated with arsenic.The article also refers to traditions within Indian culture that involve theapplication of colourful substances to the body and face, but reports that thetraditional mineral- and vegetable-based dyes have been increasingly replaced bysynthetic chemical-based dyes, especially azo dyes, which, as previouslydiscussed, are known to be neurotoxic. Azo dyes are another class of chemicalsassociated with leucoderma. It is clear, therefore, that there are many toxicsubstances that can produce the symptoms associated with leprosy; some are‘naturally-occurring’ such as lead, arsenic and mercury and others are entirelysynthetic, such as phenols, catechols and azo dyes.In the attempt to eliminate leprosy, the medical establishment has alsoadministered the BCG vaccine as a preventive, on the basis that M. leprae issimilar to M. tuberculosis. However, there are efforts to develop a vaccinespecifically for leprosy, as the BCG is claimed to only confer ‘partialprotection’; previous discussions have shown that it confers no protection. Thededicated leprosy vaccine, which was developed by IDRI (Infectious DiseaseResearch Institute) is currently undergoing trials. An October 2017 pressrelease by IDRI is entitled Promising New Leprosy Vaccine Moves into HumanTrials; the title is self-explanatory. At the time of writing, there are nofurther reports on the progress of this vaccine.It is clear from the discussions in chapter two that no vaccine has ever beenproven to be either safe or effective; the leprosy vaccine will be no exception,for the simple reason that no disease is caused by a bacterium. The abovediscussion indicates that exposures to toxic substances provide far morecredible explanations for the symptoms attributed to the disease known asleprosy.Parasitic DiseasesThe discussion about ‘other germs’ in chapter three included reference toparasites, which are defined by the establishment as,> “any living thing that lives in or on another living organism.”The medical establishment claims that, with few exceptions, parasites arepathogenic; however, the previously cited 2011 article about ‘microbialeukaryotes’ states that the functions of these organisms within the human bodyare rarely studied and therefore largely unknown. The idea that they are‘pathogenic’ is due to the rigid adherence to the ‘germ theory’ and theconsequent failure of the medical establishment to study diseases withoutreference to ‘germs’. The general view, as demonstrated by the CDC web pageentitled Parasites, is that these organisms can cause a number of diseasescommonly regarded as ‘tropical’, in other words, NTDs. Nevertheless, the pageincludes the interesting comment that,> “The burden of these diseases often rests on communities in the tropics and> subtropics, but parasitic infections also affect people in developed> countries.”"},{"pageContent":"Although the establishment definition refers to bacteria and viruses as examplesof ‘parasites’, the CDC does not. The CDC web page entitled About Parasitesclaims that there are only three types of ‘pathogenic parasite’; protozoa,helminths and ectoparasites. The page states that protozoa are found in theintestines or in the blood and tissues; those found in the intestines areclaimed to be transmitted through the faecal-oral route; those found in theblood and tissues are said to be transmitted by vectors. The CDC describeshelminths as,> “…large multicellular organisms that are generally visible to the naked eye in> their adult stages.”There are three types of helminth: flatworms, thorny-headed worms androundworms. Flatworms include trematodes, also known as flukes. Roundworms, alsoknown as nematodes, are microscopic, but one of their main functions is to actas ‘decomposers’. Most references to this role discuss it in the context of thedecomposition of dead organic matter within the soil; however, whether nematodesare part of the ‘normal flora’ or whether they are ‘invaders’, their presence inthe human body cannot be attributed to a function other than their ‘normal’function of the decomposition of dead matter.The establishment definition of an ectoparasite refers to it as,> “a parasite that lives on the outer surface of its host.”This class of parasite includes ticks, fleas, lice and mites, some of which areclaimed to directly cause disease and others are claimed to be the vectors forvarious pathogenic organisms. One ‘ectoparasite’ is the tick claimed to be thecarrier of the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is said to be the cause ofLyme disease; previous discussions have indicated the erroneous nature of theidea that this disease is caused by bacteria.A healthy human body employs self-protective mechanisms that prevent the entryof invaders; the presence of parasites is a clear indication that a person’shealth has been compromised, which means that the body’s functions, includingthe elimination of parasites, have been impaired; as explained by HerbertShelton who states in his article entitled Intestinal Parasites that,> “When you start homesteading parasites, you may know that your tissues and> secretions have become so impaired that the parasites find residence in them> possible.”This also applies to ectoparasites, the presence of which is most commonlyassociated with poor hygiene, especially infrequent washing of the body andclothes. Parasites of this type, such as lice for example, are easily eradicatedby regular bathing.The solution, according to the medical establishment, is to utilise methods andtreatments that will kill the parasites, including external parasites, it is forthis purpose that DDT was originally used. But this strategy will not resolvethe problem, mainly because it will increase exposures to toxic substances thatwill further compromise health and impair the body’s ability to initiate itsnormal defence mechanisms against parasites.TrypanosomiasisThe establishment definition refers to trypanosomiasis as,> “any disease caused by the presence of parasitic protozoans of the genus> Trypanosome.”The definition also states that,> “The two most important diseases are Chagas disease (South American> trypanosomiasis) and sleeping sickness (African trypanosomiasis).”These forms of trypanosomiasis are considered to be distinctly differentdiseases; the WHO has produced a fact sheet for each of them.The April 2019 WHO fact sheet entitled Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis)claims that most of the 6 to 7 million cases of Chagas disease occur in LatinAmerica. The disease is said to be caused by a parasite called Trypanosoma cruzithat is transmitted by a ‘triatomine bug’, which is also known as a ‘kissingbug’ as it is said to mainly bite people around the mouth. The fact sheet statesthat there are two phases of the disease and that during the first or ‘acute’phase,> “…a high number of parasites circulate in the blood but in most cases symptoms> are absent or mild and unspecific.”The absence of symptoms in the presence of a high number of parasites is notconsistent with the definition of the disease; it is also a violation of Koch’sfirst Postulate.The symptoms that may manifest during the first phase include breathingdifficulties and chest pain, neither of which can be referred to as ‘mild’. Itis during the second or chronic phase that the symptoms become serious becausethe parasites are said to ‘hide’ in the heart muscles and cause a potentiallyfatal cardiac condition.The fact sheet claims, however, that,> “Trypanosoma cruzi infection is curable if treatment is initiated soon after> infection.”Chagas disease is treated with two drugs, namely benznidazole and nifurtimox,the ‘side effects’ of both of which include polyneuropathy, nausea, vomiting,dizziness and headache. These effects demonstrate that both drugs are toxic andneurotoxic.It should be clear that Chagas disease is not caused by the T. cruzi parasite,and that the real causes of the symptoms attributed to this disease will involveexposures to a variety of toxic substances, most of which are produced byvarious industries that operate in South America. Some of the significantindustries in the region include mining and smelting, both of which have beendiscussed and shown to cause serious health hazards in addition to environmentalpollution.Other industries common throughout the region include the manufacture ofpesticides and petrochemicals. Previous discussions have indicated that theseindustries and their products are associated with many hazards to human healthand with the environmental pollution that exacerbates the hazards. The highlevel of agriculture in many regions of South America has inevitably entailedthe increased use of pesticides, which contaminate the food as well as theenvironment.The April 2019 WHO fact sheet entitled Trypanosomiasis, human African (sleepingsickness) states that this disease is endemic in 36 countries within sub-SaharanAfrica. There are said to be two forms of the disease depending on the type ofparasite involved, although the parasite called Trypanosoma brucei gambiense issaid to be responsible for 98 per cent of all cases. The vector claimed to beresponsible for the transmission of the parasite is the tsetse fly, although itis only ‘infected’ females that are said to transmit the disease when they takea blood ‘meal’. In common with female Anopheles mosquitoes, the female tsetseflies are not all infected, but, according to the fact sheet, they,> “…have acquired their infection from human beings or from animals harbouring> human pathogenic parasites.”This claim is clearly anomalous; the human disease is claimed to be caused by‘infection’ with the parasite transmitted through the bite of an infected tsetsefly, yet the fly must first be infected as the result of biting a human. Anotheranomalous feature common to virtually all ‘parasitic diseases’ is that thevector remains unaffected by the parasites that they carry within their tinybodies, whereas the far larger human ‘host’ can be seriously harmed and even diedue to their presence in the body.There are two stages of human African trypanosomiasis; the first stage, which issaid to involve the invasion of the tissues and blood, produces ‘mild’ symptomssuch as fever, headaches and joint pains. The second stage is more serious; asthe fact sheet states,> “In the second stage the parasites cross the blood-brain barrier to infect the> central nervous system.”The symptoms produced in the second stage are the reason this disease is alsoknown as sleeping sickness, as they include confusion, sensory disturbances,poor coordination and disturbance of the sleep cycle. Human Africantrypanosomiasis is also claimed to be treatable, but the fact sheet states that,> “Diagnosis and treatment of the disease is complex and requires specifically> skilled staff.”The ‘treatment’ involves five drugs, which the WHO distributes free of charge toall countries in which the disease is considered to be endemic. Two of thesedrugs are used during the first stage; these are pentamidine and suramin. Thethree drugs used during the second stage are melarsoprol, eflornithine andnifurtimox. All of these drugs are inherently toxic; the purpose for which theyare used is to kill parasites. It is therefore unsurprising that they are allassociated with adverse ‘side effects’, which include chest pain and breathingdifficulties, vomiting and diarrhoea, gastrointestinal problems andpolyneuritis, amongst others. Melarsoprol is derived from arsenic, which has along history of use in the treatment of this disease. A 2013 article entitledArsenic – the ‘Poison of Kings’ and the ‘Saviour of Syphilis’ refers to the useof arsenic-based drugs for the treatment of trypanosomiasis in the early 19thcentury and states that,> “…its effectiveness was outweighed by its neurotoxicity…”This raises the serious question of why the treatment for a disease that is saidto affect the CNS involves a substance that has long been known to beneurotoxic.As discussed in chapter four, an epidemic of lethargic encephalitis (LE)coincided with that of ‘1918 Flu’. The discussion indicated that LE is alsoknown as ‘sleepy sickness’ in order to distinguish it from ‘sleeping sickness’or human African trypanosomiasis. This distinction would seem to be irrelevantbecause both conditions are neurological; therefore, a far more plausibleexplanation for both of them would include exposures to toxic and neurotoxicsubstances.The operations of many industries located in Africa are capable of producingadverse neurological health effects; these include mining and especiallylarge-scale gold mining that invariably entails exposures to mercury, a knownneurotoxin. Exposure to mercury also results from small-scale gold mining, alsoknown as artisanal small-scale gold mining (ASGM) that has expanded in many‘developing’ countries, particularly within Africa. The report entitled TheWorld’s Worst Pollution Problems 2016 ranks ASGM as 5th in the list of Top 10Polluting Industries. The most significant pollutant associated with ASGM ismercury, which is used during the extraction process and is a recognised causeof serious health problems; as indicated by a 2017 article entitled GlobalBurden of Disease of Mercury Used in Artisanal Small-Scale Gold Mining, whichstates that,> “Gold miners are highly exposed to metallic mercury and suffer occupational> mercury intoxication.”Although miners are the most affected, they are not the only people to beexposed to mercury; people who live in the vicinity of gold mines will also beadversely affected by mercury and all other pollutants released into theenvironment. Exposure to mercury is only one factor amongst many that can causedamage to the nervous system; exposures to varying combinations of differenttoxic and neurotoxic substances provide a far more compelling explanation forneurological health problems than a ‘parasite’.LeishmaniasisThe establishment definition refers to leishmaniasis as,> “a disease, common in the tropics and subtropics, caused by parasitic> protozoans of the genus Leishmania, which are transmitted by the bite of> sandflies.”There are said to be many hundreds of sandfly species, but only some of them areclaimed to be vectors of the Leishmania parasite, as the March 2019 WHO factsheet entitled Leishmaniasis states,> “Over 90 sandfly species are known to transmit Leishmania parasites.”There are also many species of parasite, as the fact sheet states,> “Leishmaniasis is caused by a protozoa parasite from over 20 Leishmania> species.”In common with other ‘parasitic’ diseases, leishmaniasis is said to be caused bythe transmission of a parasite through the bite of an ‘infected’ female when shetakes a blood ‘meal’. However, the discussion about leishmaniasis in chapterthree referred to the claim by the WHO that, in most cases, ‘infection’ with theparasite does not result in disease; this is corroborated by the CDC FAQ webpage about the disease that states,> “Some people have a silent infection, without any symptoms or signs.”It is claimed that there are three distinct forms of the disease; they arereferred to as visceral, cutaneous and mucocutaneous.Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), which is also known as kala-azar, is the mostserious and is said to be fatal in the vast majority of cases, unless treated.The symptoms of VL, which is said to be ‘highly endemic’ in India and EastAfrica, include anaemia and enlargement of the spleen and the liver. Cutaneousleishmaniasis (CL) is said to be the most common form; the main symptoms areskin lesions, usually in the form of ulcers. Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (ML) issaid to involve the destruction of the mucous membranes of the nose, mouth andthroat.There is, however, no explanation for the manifestation of three distinctlydifferent groups of symptoms that are claimed to be caused by members of thesame species of parasite. The CDC web pages about leishmaniasis include oneentitled Biology that presents a diagram of the life-cycle of the parasite.Interestingly, the page states that,> “Parasite, host, and other factors affect whether the infection becomes> symptomatic and whether cutaneous or visceral leishmaniasis results.”The web page provides no further details about the ‘other factors’ said to beinvolved; nor does it provide an explanation for the role of the ‘host’ in thedevelopment of disease. The WHO fact sheet, however, does provide some cluesabout these ‘other factors’ in the statement that,> “The disease affects some of the poorest people on earth, and is associated> with malnutrition, population displacement, poor housing, a weak immune system> and lack of financial resources.”The reason that sandflies would choose to only ‘bite’ and ‘infect’ poor peoplewho are malnourished remains unexplained. However, as previously cited, theMolecular Biology of the Cell textbook states that ‘dedicated pathogens’ do notrequire the host to have a weakened immune system.The fact sheet refers to leishmaniasis as treatable and curable, but that thetreatment,> “…requires an immunocompetent system because medicines will not get rid of the> parasite from the body…”This indicates that the people most affected by the disease cannot be treated.Although the fact sheet does not provide details of the ‘medicines’ recommendedby the WHO, this information is available in a 2017 article entitled Diagnosisand Treatment of Leishmaniasis that provides clinical practice guidelines andstates that,> “The only Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved medications for the> treatment of leishmaniasis are intravenous liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB)> for VL and oral miltefosine for CL, ML and VL caused by particular species.”In common with all drugs, those recommended for leishmaniasis are toxic andproduce many adverse effects. Liposomal amphotericin is associated withnephrotoxic effects and liver damage. Miltefosine is associated with nausea,vomiting and diarrhoea; it can also cause liver and kidney problems. It shouldbe noted that previous treatments for leishmaniasis have included, and in somecases still include, antimony-based drugs; antimony is a known toxin.The claims about leishmaniasis, like all other ‘parasitic’ diseases, are highlyanomalous; none of them provides an adequate explanation for the mechanism bywhich microscopic organisms can cause serious and potentially fatal healthproblems for humans but produce no ill effects in the tiny insect vector. Thereis also no explanation for the claim that ‘infection’ is not always accompaniedby symptoms. There is however, a plausible explanation for the symptomsassociated with this disease; like all other diseases, this includes exposure toa variety of toxic substances.SchistosomiasisThe establishment definition of schistosomiasis, also known as bilharzia, refersto,> “a tropical disease caused by blood flukes of the genus Schistosoma.”Schistosoma blood flukes, also known as trematodes, are a type of worm; thevector claimed to be responsible for their transmission is a freshwater snail,as the April 2019 WHO fact sheet entitled Schistosomiasis states,> “People become infected when larval forms of the parasite – released by> freshwater snails – penetrate the skin during contact with infested water.”The infestation of water is claimed to occur when people ‘infected’ with thedisease contaminate the water with their faeces, which contain the eggs of theSchistosoma parasites that require fresh water in order to hatch. The CDC webpages entitled Schistosomiasis include one entitled Biology that claims thereare three main species of parasite that ‘infect’ humans; it also provides adiagram of the parasite’s life-cycle.There are said to be two forms of the disease, one of which is intestinal andproduces symptoms that include abdominal pain, diarrhoea and blood in the stool.The symptoms of the advanced form of the disease include enlargement of theliver; however, according to the WHO fact sheet,> “Symptoms of schistosomiasis are caused by the body’s reaction to the worm’s> eggs.”It is clear that the symptoms described above can result from the body’sreactions to exposures to toxic substances; the fact sheet also claims that,> “In children, schistosomiasis can cause anaemia, stunting and a reduced> ability to learn…”There is no explanation for the mechanisms by which a parasite is able toproduce such a wide variety of symptoms that include impaired growth anddevelopment, which, as previously discussed, are functions regulated by theendocrine system.Unsurprisingly, and like the other ‘parasitic’ diseases discussed in thischapter, schistosomiasis mainly affects certain sectors of the population, asthe fact sheet states,> “Schistosomiasis is prevalent in tropical and subtropical areas, especially in> poor communities without access to safe drinking water and adequate> sanitation.”Also, like the other parasitic diseases, the fact sheet claims thatschistosomiasis can be controlled through ‘medicines’,> “The WHO strategy for schistosomiasis control focuses on reducing disease> through periodic targeted treatment with praziquantel…”The populations targeted for this ‘preventive’ treatment are those people wholive in the ‘highly endemic’ areas, which are predominantly within Africa.Praziquantel is also used in the treatment of a number of other parasiticinfections. However, like all treatments of this type, the purpose ofpraziquantel is to kill parasites; this drug is therefore inherently toxic; itis, unsurprisingly associated with adverse health effects such as abdominalpain, vomiting and headache. More serious effects include dizziness, fatigue andvertigo.Another similarity with the other ‘parasitic’ diseases is that the Schistosomaparasites do not appear to affect the vector, in this case, the water snail;although the process is unexplained, it is claimed that the snails are‘equipped’ to defend themselves. This would suggest that, yet again, the smallvector remains unaffected by a parasite that can cause serious harm to the muchlarger human hosts, who are believed to be incapable of defending themselves.But, contrary to this belief, humans are not defenceless; the human body has anumber of self-protective mechanisms. The existence of these mechanisms iscorroborated by a 2017 article entitled Nitric oxide blocks the development ofthe human parasite Schistosoma japonicum; the title is self-explanatory.However, the body’s protective mechanisms may be impaired when health has beencompromised as the result of poor living conditions and malnutrition, forexample.The likely causes of the symptoms associated with schistosomiasis, which isclaimed to be transmitted through ‘infested’ water, will include pesticides,such as larvicides to control mosquito larvae, that are applied directly into ornear bodies of fresh water. In addition to these toxins, are many other watercontaminants, such as toxic industrial wastes discharged into these bodies ofwater.Noncommunicable DiseasesTarget 4 of SDG 3 aims to,> “By 2030, reduce by one third premature mortality from non-communicable> diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and> well-being.”Although noncommunicable diseases were discussed in detail in chapter seven,they require a further, albeit brief, discussion in the context of theirprevalence in ‘developing’ countries, because, as the WHO June 2018 fact sheetentitled Noncommunicable diseases states,> “NCDs disproportionately affect people in low- and middle-income countries…”This statement is not consistent with the claim that communicable diseases aremore prevalent in ‘developing’ countries. It is also inconsistent with thestatement in the Global Health Risks report that the types of diseases changefrom communicable to noncommunicable as countries ‘develop’. The populations of‘low- and middle-income’ countries would seem to be ‘disproportionatelyaffected’ by disease of all types.The idea that any disease disproportionately affects people in ‘developing’countries needs to be placed into the correct context with reference to twocircumstances, the first of which is that the overwhelming majority of the worldpopulation lives in countries categorised as ‘developing’. The second is that,as the medical establishment has admitted, most ‘developing’ countries do nothave adequate, if any, systems for recording and reporting disease morbidity andmortality. The statistics provided by the medical establishment and reported infact sheets do not reflect exact numbers, but instead, are predominantlyestimates generated by computer models.Nevertheless, the WHO fact sheet claims that certain sectors of the populationare more likely to become ill,> “Vulnerable and socially disadvantaged people get sicker and die sooner than> people of higher social positions…”The reasons are claimed to be because ‘low-income’ countries in particular lackthe resources to provide adequate ‘healthcare services’, and because most peoplein those countries lack the income to be able to afford the few services and‘treatments’ that are available. Therefore, according to the fact sheet,> “Poverty is closely linked with NCDs.”It should be clear that ‘poverty’ is not unique to the populations of‘developing’ countries. More importantly, however, an individual person’s stateof health is not related to the stage of development or the income of thecountry in which they live; their individual personal circumstances exert a fargreater influence over their health. These circumstances involve a wide varietyof factors that are unique to each person, as will be discussed in more detailin chapter ten.The previously cited Global Action Plan report, states that,> “Four main shared risk factors—tobacco use, unhealthy diet, physical> inactivity and harmful use of alcohol—are the most important in the sphere of> noncommunicable diseases.”The reference to these risk factors as ‘behavioural’ and ‘modifiable’, as wellas the ‘most important’ in respect of the onset of NCDs, is intended to suggestthat people who engage in these ‘behaviours’ are mostly responsible for theirown illness when they have been diagnosed with an NCD. Although three of thesefactors do contribute to ill-health, they are by no means the only factorsrelevant to NCDs, as the discussions in chapter seven demonstrated.People are, to a large extent, responsible for their own health and ill-health,as will be further discussed in chapter ten; however, it is disingenuous of themedical establishment to repudiate any share of the responsibility for theescalation of ill-health around the world. The phenomenon of iatrogenesisdemonstrates that ‘modern medicine’ is a major contributory factor to illness;pharmaceutical drugs are not conducive to improved health.The four major NCDs said to cause the highest mortality are: cardiovasculardiseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes, all of which areclaimed to significantly affect the populations of low- and middle-incomecountries; as indicated by the May 2017 WHO fact sheet entitled Cardiovasculardiseases (CVDs), which states that,> “At least three quarters of the world’s deaths from CVDs occur in low- and> middle-income countries.”CVDs are said to be caused by the same four behavioural risk factors that applyto all NCDs. These factors are referred to as modifiable, which is intended toindicate that CVDs are therefore preventable through the modification oravoidance of the relevant behaviours. It is claimed that these behaviours causeCVDs because they precipitate the development of ‘intermediate risk factors’,such as raised blood pressure, which, according to the medical establishment,should be treated. However, as the discussion about CVDs in chapter sevenindicated, blood pressure-lowering drugs cause additional health problems andoften fail to prevent a heart attack or stroke.The burden of cancer in ‘low- and middle-income countries’ is claimed to besubstantial; as indicated by the September 2018 WHO fact sheet entitled Cancerthat states,> “Approximately 70% of deaths from cancer occur in low- and middle-income> countries.”In addition to the four main ‘risk factors’, the fact sheet claims that certain‘infections’ are particularly relevant to the onset of cancer in ‘developing’countries,> “Cancer causing infections, such as hepatitis and human papilloma virus (HPV),> are responsible for up to 25% of cancer cases in low- and middle-income> countries.”As previously discussed, cancer and ‘infections’ involve completely differentmechanisms of action. Unfortunately, the belief that viruses are pathogens thatcan also cause cancer, has encouraged the development of various vaccinesclaimed to be able to provide protection against ‘cancer-causing infections’;according to the fact sheet,> “Vaccination against these HPV and hepatitis B viruses could prevent 1 million> cancer cases each year.”As previous discussions have shown, this claim is unfounded; the overwhelmingbody of evidence demonstrates that vaccines cannot prevent any disease,including cancer.The WHO web page entitled Chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) claims that themost common CRD is asthma; the WHO August 2017 fact sheet entitled Asthma statesthat 235 million people suffer from asthma and that,> “Most asthma-related deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries.”The previous discussion about asthma indicated that one of the major causes ofthe condition involves inhalation of toxic irritants, whether air pollution,VOCs or other airborne contaminants. It is interesting, therefore, that one ofthe less common CRDs is referred to as ‘occupational lung disease’, which isclearly the result of workplace exposures to substances that irritate and damagethe respiratory system; but it is inappropriate to describe such damage as a‘disease’. The expansion of industrialisation in, as well as the increasingrelocation of polluting industries to, ‘developing’ countries contribute to anever-greater incidence of many health problems, including those that affect therespiratory system.Diabetes is the fourth major NCD; it is another disease that is anticipated tocontinue to increase in incidence. Furthermore, according to the WHO October2018 fact sheet entitled Diabetes,> “Diabetes prevalence has been rising more rapidly in middle- and low-income> countries.”The fact sheet claims that excess body weight is a major risk factor for type 2diabetes and that a healthy diet is one method by which this condition can beprevented. However, although the WHO recommends an increased intake of fruit andvegetables, the fact sheet fails to acknowledge the full extent to which anunhealthy diet that mainly consists of processed foods and drinks made with highlevels of refined sugars, contributes to the disease. The previous discussionabout diabetes included the reference by Dr Henry Bieler to the existence of a‘toxic background’ in people with this condition; the discussion also referredto the role of refined sugar, which is described as the ‘sweetest poison ofall’. The increased consumption of highly-processed food products and drinks bypeople in ‘developing’ countries will exacerbate their health problems.The measures deemed necessary to address the burden of disease caused by alltypes of NCDs are briefly referred to in the Global Action Plan report, theForeword of which declares that,> “WHO and other UN Organizations will support national efforts with upstream> policy advice and sophisticated technical assistance, ranging from helping> governments to set national targets to implement even relatively simple steps> which can make a huge difference, such as raising tobacco taxes, reducing the> amount of salt in foods and improving access to inexpensive drugs to prevent> heart attacks and strokes.”It has been shown historically that raising taxes on tobacco or alcohol, orboth, is virtually ineffective as a deterrent. Price increases rarely discouragethe vast majority of consumers from continuing to purchase tobacco products oralcohol; they will however, succeed in causing greater hardship and deepeningpoverty. A more appropriate and responsible measure would be for the medicalestablishment to properly inform the public about the serious health hazardsfrom the factors discussed in chapter six; the reasons this is unlikely tohappen are discussed in chapter nine.In common with all aspects of medical establishment practices, the recommendedmeasures to address the health problems due to NCDs are claimed to bescientifically established and based on the latest evidence, as the GlobalAction Plan report states,> “Scientific knowledge demonstrates that the noncommunicable disease burden can> be greatly reduced if cost-effective preventive and curative actions, along> with interventions for prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases> already available, are implemented in an effective and balanced manner.”However, as the report states, the recommended measures are also to includeactions to improve access to drugs claimed to prevent heart attacks and strokes.One of these suggested drugs is acetylsalicylic acid, better known as aspirin,for the prevention of acute myocardial infarction. The report also recommendshepatitis B vaccinations for the prevention of liver cancer. Previousdiscussions have demonstrated that neither of these measures are preventive orcurative and that they are both associated with adverse health effects.The burden of NCDs is considered to be of such a magnitude, especially for‘developing’ countries, that, according to the WHO fact sheet,> “NCDs threaten progress towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development…”The high level of mortality due to NCDs is said to pose a serious threat to the‘economy’ of countries as well as to their ‘sustainable development’. Thepremature deaths of millions of people in their ‘productive’ years is said toimpose a significant economic burden on all countries, but especially on thosecountries categorised as ‘developing’. This burden is compounded by the cost ofhealthcare services and the interventions required to treat people who have beendiagnosed with an NCD. Although these people remain alive, their illnessincapacitates them, which means they are unable to work and therefore unable tocontribute to the economy.It is for this reason that interventions are required to be ‘cost-effective’; inother words, it is claimed that the actions to be taken should not cost morethan a person is able to contribute to the economy; this view is expressed bythe Global Action Plan report in the statement that,> “There are interventions for prevention and control of noncommunicable> diseases that are affordable for all countries and give a good return on> investment generating one year of healthy life for a cost that falls below the> gross domestic product (GDP) per person…”The interventions proposed by the medical establishment, however‘cost-effective’ they may be, will not generate a ‘healthy life’ for any person,nor will they reduce the incidence of NCDs.Many ‘interventions’ claimed to prevent and control NCDs have been successfullyintroduced into the health services of ‘developed’ countries; a strategy that isto be expanded, so that similar interventions can be introduced into the healthservices of all ‘developing’ countries. These interventions include a variety of‘medicines’ and vaccines, the increased production of which will inevitablygenerate a massive boost to the income and profits of pharmaceuticalmanufacturing companies. Unfortunately, but equally inevitable, is that, ifsuccessfully implemented, interventions of this nature will generate asubstantially increased incidence of iatrogenic illness and death in‘developing’ countries.Mental HealthIn addition to the reduction of NCDs, the aim of SDG 3.4 is to promote mentalhealth and well-being, which is recognised to be as important as physical healthand well-being. Mental health has been discussed in chapter one and will bediscussed again in chapter ten, but requires a brief discussion in this chapterin the context of how mental health and well-being for everyone, everywhere isto be achieved.Good mental health, like good physical health, is perceived to be important sothat people can be ‘productive units’; as indicated by the Mental Health ActionPlan 2013-2020 report, which states that,> “Good mental health enables people to realize their potential, cope with the> normal stresses of life, work productively, and contribute to their> communities.”The medical establishment considers that poor mental health is indicative of a‘mental health problem’, or ‘mental disorder’, as they are more commonlylabelled. As previously cited in chapter one, the April 2018 WHO fact sheetentitled Mental disorders claims that,> “There are many different mental disorders, with different presentations.”Although the reason remains unexplained, the medical establishment claims thatthe incidence of ‘mental disorders’ is rising and that these conditions affectpeople in all countries, whether ‘developed’ or ‘developing’; as the fact sheetstates,> “The burden of mental disorders continues to grow with significant impacts on> health and major social, human rights and economic consequences in all> countries of the world.”One of the major consequences of the continually growing incidence of ‘mentaldisorders’ is, according to the fact sheet, that,> “Health systems have not yet adequately responded to the burden of mental> disorders.”The failure of ‘health systems’ to adequately respond means that they haveinsufficient numbers of staff, especially suitably qualified psychiatrists, toprovide the necessary services for people who have ‘mental disorders’. Thesepoor staffing levels are claimed to have a more profound effect in ‘developing’countries; as indicated by the Mental Health Action Plan report that states,> “The number of specialized and general health workers dealing with mental> health in low-income and middle-income countries is grossly insufficient.”Another of the major concerns expressed in the report is that,> “People with mental disorders experience disproportionately higher rates of> disability and mortality.”This claim requires further examination. Like a ‘physical illness’, a ‘mentalillness’ is said to be diagnosed by the manifestation of certain symptoms;however, unlike a physical illness, the symptoms associated with a mentalillness are rather nebulous. Although previously cited, the WHO fact sheetstates that ‘mental disorders’ are,> “…generally characterized by a combination of abnormal thoughts, perceptions,> emotions, behaviour and relationships with others.”There is, however, no clear definition of what constitutes ‘normal’ with respectto a person’s thoughts, perceptions, emotions, behaviours and relationships.Furthermore, as discussed in chapter one, there are no scientificallyestablished criteria or tests to determine the existence of an ‘abnormal’ mentalstate; the interpretation of ‘abnormal’ is highly subjective.The most important aspect of the claim that the burden of ‘mental disorders’ isincreasing is that these conditions are generally considered to require‘treatment’; but these treatments are not readily available to everyoneperceived to be in need of them. The fact sheet reports that one of theconsequences of the inadequate response by health systems has been that,> “…the gap between the need for treatment and its provision is wide all over> the world.”The fact sheet claims that in ‘high-income’ countries, this ‘gap’ may affectbetween 35 and 50 per cent of people with mental disorders; but in ‘low- andmiddle-income’ countries, this gap is far worse and may affect between 76 and 85per cent of people with mental disorders.Specific treatments are not mentioned in the report or the fact sheet, althoughboth refer to non-pharmacological approaches as well as to ‘medicines’. Theclaim that there are gaps between treatment and its provision would seem tojustify the concerns about the inadequate levels of staff in the field of‘mental health’; however, psychiatry is increasingly biased towards the use ofpharmacological approaches in preference to non-pharmacological ones. Thediscussion in chapter one about psychiatric medications indicated that, not onlyare they entirely inappropriate as ‘treatment’ for conditions labelled as‘mental disorders’, but they are also eminently capable of causing a great dealof harm, including a worsening of the symptoms they are claimed to manage.In addition to pharmaceutical products, the treatment of ‘mental disorders’ mayinclude therapies such as ‘electric shock’ treatments, which are reported to beundergoing a revival, although under the label ECT (electroconvulsive therapy),and mainly used in the treatment of depression. Previous discussions havereferred to the bioelectrical nature of the body, and to the evidence thatexposures to certain electromagnetic fields produce detrimental effects on manyof the body’s functions. The direct application of an unnatural electric currentto the brain, one of the two major organs that function bioelectrically, has theability to cause serious harm. The increased use of ‘treatments’, both chemicaland electrical, will clearly exacerbate the incidence of iatrogenic morbidityand mortality; they do not contribute to good mental or physical health andwell-being.As previously cited, the fact sheet states that,> “Stress, genetics, nutrition, perinatal infections and exposure to> environmental hazards are also contributing factors to mental disorders.”Stress is a significant factor; the many circumstances that can induce stressinclude wars and conflicts; the effects of the stresses of war on soldiers havebeen recognised and assigned labels such as ‘shell shock’ and PTSD(post-traumatic stress disorder); but it is not solely those involved in thefighting that are affected by war. The nature of war has changed dramaticallysince WWI as have the types of weapons used. However, although the world has notbeen at war since 1945, many smaller wars and conflicts have taken place in manydifferent regions of the world, including those within ‘developing’ countries.Some of these conflicts have been of a long duration and have created manyhumanitarian crises involving large numbers of refugees who have had to fleetheir homes in order to survive. These refugees clearly exist in a perpetualstate of severe stress, but they cannot be regarded as suffering from a ‘mentaldisorder’.There are many reasons that people may exhibit the symptoms associated with a‘mental disorder’, including, as the fact sheet acknowledges, ‘exposure toenvironmental hazards’. These hazards include unnatural electromagneticradiation and a wide variety of neurotoxic substances, all of which are known toaffect the functions of the brain. Common neurotoxins include aluminium,mercury, lead, aspartame, methanol and fluoride, to name just a few; theseneurotoxic substances can be found in various everyday household products aswell as pesticides, ‘medicines’ and vaccines.It is clear therefore, that the increased rates of disability and mortalityclaimed to be associated with ‘mental disorders’ are the direct result of thesame factors that cause virtually all conditions of illness.Reproductive HealthThere are two aspects relating to ‘reproductive health’; the first refers tomaternal mortality, which is the subject of target 1 of SDG 3 that aims to,> “By 2030, reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per> 100,000 live births.”The scale of this problem is indicated by the February 2018 WHO fact sheetentitled Maternal mortality, which states that,> “Every day, approximately 830 women die from preventable causes related to> pregnancy and childbirth.”The fact sheet also states that,> “99% of all maternal deaths occur in developing countries.”Significantly, the fact sheet claims that more than half of these maternaldeaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa and that they mainly affect the poor in ruralareas. The veracity of these statistics is questionable on the basis of theadmission that most ‘developing’ countries lack adequate mortality datacollecting systems.The main cause of maternal mortality is attributed to ‘complications’ that arelargely preventable, but occur because women in ‘developing’ countries, unliketheir counterparts in ‘developed’ countries, lack access to ‘healthcareservices’, especially those provided by antenatal clinics. The inequity of thissituation is used to justify demands that pregnant women in ‘developing’countries receive the same level of antenatal and postnatal care as women in‘developed’ countries; as indicated by the fact sheet that states,> “All women need access to antenatal care in pregnancy, skilled care during> childbirth and care and support in the weeks after childbirth.”It would seem that, according to this attitude, the medical establishmentperceives pregnancy and childbirth to be ‘medical conditions’ rather than partof the natural processes of human life. Whilst it certainly is important forwomen to receive an appropriate level of care during pregnancy and childbirth,women have successfully carried, given birth to and cared for babies for tens,if not hundreds of thousands of years with the assistance of other women actingas midwives. Although, in the past, many women have died during childbirth,reductions in maternal mortality are mainly due to the same factors that havecontributed to overall health, such as nutrition and improved living conditions,for example.It is acknowledged that complications may occur and that they will require theapplication of certain skills to protect both mother and baby, but thesecomplications do not occur in sufficient numbers to necessitate intervention inall cases. The purpose of most interventions is to prevent a potential problemrather than address an existing problem; the discussions throughout this bookindicate that most medical ‘interventions’ are unnecessary and many aredecidedly harmful.Three of the ‘complications’ specifically referred to are: severe bleeding,‘infections’ and high blood pressure, all of which are claimed to requireinterventions as preventive measures; for example, the fact sheet claims that,> “Injecting oxytocin immediately after childbirth effectively reduces the risk> of bleeding.”Oxytocin is a hormone; the injected form is a synthetic derivative, which, likeall pharmaceutical hormones is known to produce ‘side effects’. The effectsassociated with injected oxytocin include nausea and vomiting, which areindicative of its toxic nature. It should be noted that oxytocin is also used toinduce labour and to induce an abortion.Antenatal clinics provide a variety of services, including blood tests, todetect the existence of underlying conditions that may pose a problem during thepregnancy or childbirth. Unfortunately, one of those tests is to determine apregnant woman’s ‘HIV status’, which is of particular concern in ‘developing’countries, but especially in African countries where ‘HIV’ is claimed to be mostprevalent. However, as previously discussed, pregnancy is one of the‘conditions’ that can give rise to a ‘false positive’ HIV test result.Nevertheless, a positive test result is very likely to lead to ‘treatment’ withtoxic ARV ‘medicines’ for the mother, both during and after her pregnancy, andfor the baby after birth; the toxicity of these drugs has been discussed.Postnatal care also involves various services, some of which may involve certaininterventions for the baby as well as the mother; the main interventions offeredto newborn babies are ‘immunisations’, the problems and hazards with which havebeen discussed at length.The second aspect of ‘reproductive health’ refers to a wider range of issuesthat are incorporated into target 7 of SDG 3, the aim of which is to,> “By 2030, ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care> services, including for family planning, information and education and the> integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programmes.”The justification for interventions in respect of ‘reproductive health’ isindicated by the February 2018 WHO fact sheet entitled Familyplanning/contraception, which, under the sub-heading Slowing population growth,states that,> “Family planning is key to slowing unsustainable population growth and the> resulting negative impacts on the economy, environment, and national and> regional development efforts.”The idea that population growth is ‘unsustainable’ is based on the theoryattributed to Thomas Malthus, which claims that, if unchecked, the rate ofgrowth of the population will always exceed the rate of growth of foodproduction. This theory has been interpreted to mean that population growthrates should therefore be ‘controlled’; the topic of ‘population control’ isdiscussed in chapter nine. However, the mistaken belief that this idearepresents a bona fide theory has had profound consequences, not least of whichhas been the promotion of fear-based claims that the world is in imminent dangerof becoming ‘overpopulated’ and unable to provide sufficient food for theburgeoning population. According to the Population Reference Bureau (PRB) webpage entitled 2017 World Population Data Sheet, the world population isprojected to reach 9.8 billion by 2050. Furthermore, the page claims that,> “…Africa’s population will more than double to 2.6 billion by 2050…”The purpose of this statement is to instil fear into people; it is intended toconvey the impression that such a population increase would create a huge‘problem’, but this claim fails to recognise that Africa, a resource-rich regionof the world, is the second largest continent with a land area of approximately30.3 million km2. It also fails to recognise that, even if this populationgrowth were to occur, the continent would not be overcrowded, nor would Africansbe unable to feed themselves; the topic of food production in Africa isdiscussed in more detail later in this chapter. The main UN organisationresponsible for matters relating to ‘population’ is UNFPA, which is described onthe About us web page as,> “…the United Nations reproductive health and rights agency. Our mission is to> deliver a world where every pregnancy is wanted, every childbirth is safe and> every young person’s potential is fulfilled.”The mission of UNFPA is related to ‘sexual health’ as well as ‘reproductivehealth’, and the importance of both to ‘development, as the web page entitledSexual and reproductive health states,> “UNFPA works to ensure sexual and reproductive health and rights remain at the> very centre of development.”The concern about ‘sexual health’ is almost entirely related to ‘infections’that are claimed to be sexually transmitted and to cause serious healthproblems, even death; as the UNFPA indicates on the same page that states,> “More than a million people acquire an STI every single day. Without diagnosis> and treatment, some STIs, such as HIV or syphilis, can be fatal.”In addition, UNFPA claims that these ‘infections’ can affect pregnancy andchildbirth, as indicated by the statement that,> “STIs can also cause pregnancy-related complications, including stillbirth,> congenital infections, sepsis and neonatal death.”The claims in both of the above statements are unfounded; they are alsoerroneous. Previous discussions have demonstrated that no disease is caused by‘pathogenic organisms’; that no disease is sexually transmitted; and that thetreatments used for these diseases are harmful. Previous discussions have alsoindicated that many factors are able to cause the wide variety of healthproblems erroneously attributed to ‘infections’; these factors include, but arenot restricted to, exposures to chemicals and electromagnetic radiation that candisrupt the mother’s endocrine system and adversely affect her developing baby.It should be clear that health problems caused by toxic chemicals or EMradiation cannot be prevented by better access to ‘healthcare services’ thatinclude the administration of medicines and vaccines. Furthermore, some of theproposed ‘solutions’ are likely to be contributory factors; for example, the WHOfamily planning fact sheet claims that,> “Some family planning methods, such as condoms, help prevent the transmission> of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.”This claim fails to acknowledge the existence of health risks associated withthe use of certain types of contraceptives. The materials used to make condomsinclude latex, which has been associated with ‘allergic’ reactions; a clearindication that this material is an irritant. In addition, condoms are generallyused in conjunction with a lubricant and a spermicide; one of the chemicals usedas an ingredient of condom lubricants is benzene; a known carcinogen. A commoningredient of spermicides is a substance called nonoxynol-9, which is alsoreported to be an irritant. As previously discussed, the definition of a‘poison’ includes reference to a substance that causes irritation to the body’stissues; the materials and chemical ingredients used in condoms can therefore bedescribed as ‘toxic’, although spermicides are toxic by intention. Theapplication of toxic substances to the genital area or inside the body istherefore, eminently capable of causing irritations and other unpleasantsymptoms that may be mistakenly interpreted to indicate the presence of an‘infection’.The causes of reproductive health problems cannot be separated from the causesof all health problems; but none of them can be addressed by most of therecommended interventions provided through ‘health services’, especially thosethat treat pregnancy and childbirth as if they were ‘medical conditions’ ratherthan natural processes.Hazardous ChemicalsThe harmful effects of exposures to ‘hazardous chemicals’ are recognised intarget 9 of SDG 3 that aims to,> “By 2030, substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from> hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution and contamination.”The measures by which the goals of the 2030 Agenda are to be achieved, aregenerally incorporated into a variety of programmes to be administered byorganisations within or associated with the UN system; in the case of healthmatters, this will invariably involve the WHO. One such programme is the IPCS(International Programme on Chemical Safety), which is administered by the WHO.The WHO web page about the IPCS describes its function and states that, throughIPCS,> “…WHO works to establish the scientific basis for the sound management of> chemicals, and to strengthen national capabilities and capacities for chemical> safety.”The web page also provides links to related topics, one of which is a pageentitled Ten chemicals of major public health concern. These ten chemicals, orgroups of chemicals, are: air pollution; arsenic; asbestos; benzene; cadmium;dioxin and dioxin-like substances; inadequate or excess fluoride; lead; mercury;and highly hazardous pesticides. With the sole exception of ‘inadequatefluoride’, these substances have all been proven to be extremely hazardous tohealth.Air pollution is produced by a number of substances; some of the major airpollutants are discussed in a 2010 WHO report entitled WHO Guidelines for indoorair quality: selected pollutants. The pollutants referred to include: benzene,formaldehyde, radon, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and trichloroethylene,amongst others; the report states that all of the listed pollutants,> “…have indoor sources, are known in respect of their hazardousness to health> and are often found indoors in concentrations of health concern.”The report also states that only the effects of individual chemicals areconsidered, but recognises that exposures are always to combinations ofpollutants; nevertheless, the report admits that,> “Data dealing with the effects of co-exposure to air pollutants are very> limited…”The existence of limited information about the hazards from exposures tocombinations of multiple substances is common to all ‘hazardous chemicals’, notjust air pollutants.The WHO web page about the IPCS also provides a link to a page entitled Publichealth impact of chemicals: knowns and unknowns, which refers to a 2016 reportwith the same title. The web page provides some information about the contentsof the report including an Overview that refers to the loss in 2012 of more thanone million lives,> “…due to exposures to selected chemicals.”It has been acknowledged by the scientific and medical research communities thatthere is a dearth of information about the hazards caused by most chemicals;this paucity of data is also recognised by the WHO on the Overview page thatstates,> “…data are only available for a small number of chemical exposures and people> are exposed to many more chemicals every day.”The report claims that ‘unintentional poisonings’ are responsible for anestimated 193,000 deaths annually, most of which are said to be preventable,which suggests that they mainly result from accidental exposures to ‘poisons’;the report states that,> “Chemicals such as heavy metals, pesticides, solvents, paints, detergents,> kerosene, carbon monoxide and drugs lead to unintentional poisonings at home> and in the workplace.”One of the recommended solutions for the problem of unintentional poisonings inthe home is to store medicines and cleaning products ‘out of reach’, althoughthis presumably refers to the reach of small children. The number of deaths fromaccidental poisoning represents only a small fraction of the total number ofpeople who are harmed or killed by regular, long-term exposures to the plethoraof toxic ingredients of a wide variety of products used regularly in the homeand workplace, a number of which were discussed in chapter six.Despite the acknowledged paucity of data about the full extent of the adversehealth effects that can be caused by exposures to hazardous chemicals, theprevailing view is that the impact on human health and the environment can beminimised through the implementation of ‘sound management’ practices; asdemonstrated by target 4 of SDG 12 that aims to,> “By 2020, achieve the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all> wastes throughout their life cycle, in accordance with agreed international> frameworks, and significantly reduce their release to air, water and soil in> order to minimize their adverse impacts on human health and the environment.”It is interesting to note that this target is anticipated to be achieved by 2020and therefore a full decade earlier than most other 2030 Agenda goals; this isextremely ambitious considering the magnitude of the problem. However, merely‘managing’ toxic chemicals is not an appropriate solution, as it permitsindustry to continue manufacturing them; which will continue to pollute theenvironment and contribute to human health problems.The main ‘global authority’ within the UN system for matters relating to theenvironment is UNEP, or UN Environment as it is now referred to; according tothe web page entitled About UN Environment,> “The United Nations Environment Programme (UN Environment) is the leading> global environmental authority that sets the global environmental agenda,> promotes the coherent implementation of the environmental dimension of> sustainable development within the United Nations system, and serves as an> authoritative advocate for the global environment.”The UNEP-led ‘international framework’ that governs policies in respect of themanagement of chemicals includes ICCM (International Conference of ChemicalsManagement), which is referred to as the ‘governing body’ of UNEP’s SAICM, whichis described on the web page entitled SAICM Overview,> “The Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM) is a> policy framework to promote chemical safety around the world.”In 2015, UNEP produced a brochure entitled Strategic Approach to InternationalChemicals Management: Good Chemistry, Together, which refers to chemicals as,> “…the building blocks of many things we use, eat and wear.”The brochure also states that,> “From food and clothing to transport and technology and virtually everything> in between, chemicals are part of daily life.”This claim is intended to convey the impression that chemicals are normalcomponents of virtually everything and that it therefore makes no differencewhether chemicals are ‘natural’, derived from natural substances orsynthetically produced; the discussions throughout this book indicate otherwise.The Healthy Environments report recognises that the condition of the environmentinfluences the health of the people who inhabit that environment and claims thatapproximately 23 per cent of all deaths are,> “…due to modifiable environmental factors.”These ‘environmental factors’ are admitted to include chemicals; however, aspreviously discussed, the vast majority of chemicals remain entirely untestedfor the full range of their potential adverse health effects. This means thatthe scientific community has an extremely limited knowledge about the fullextent of the harm that individual ‘hazardous chemicals’ can cause. The limitedextent of this knowledge is compounded by the virtual absence of tests conductedto determine the adverse health effects from exposures to multiple combinationsof ‘hazardous chemicals’. This situation is further exacerbated by the existenceof ‘trade secrets’ that permit the chemical composition of compounds andproducts to be categorised as ‘proprietary information’, and thereforeinaccessible to independent assessment of their safety or potential adversehealth effects.Although different sources report different numbers of chemicals on the market,the SAICM brochure states that,> “Around 100,000 chemical substances are found in products or are on the> market.”The brochure also acknowledges that,> “…chemical safety is an urgent issue that increasingly affects us all.”Yet again, it is claimed that certain populations are more affected by‘environmental factors’ than others; fact number six on the WHO web pageentitled 10 facts on preventing disease through healthy environments statesthat,> “Low- and middle-income countries bear the greatest share of environmental> disease.”The reason for this increased burden of ‘environmental disease’ is claimed to bethat it results from the production and use of chemicals in ‘developing’countries; however, according to the SAICM brochure,> “It is estimated that by 2020, developing countries will produce 31 per cent> of global chemicals and use 33 per cent of global chemicals.”Although expanded chemical production in ‘developing’ countries is regarded asan important aspect of ‘development’, and therefore to be encouraged, the SAICMbrochure sounds a note of caution in the statement that,> “If improperly managed, chemicals and the pollution linked with their> manufacture, use and disposal come at a cost to the economy, human health and> the environment.”The ‘costs’ to human health and the environment are not merely the result ofchemicals that have been ‘improperly managed’; instead, they are the directresult of the ubiquitous manufacture, use and disposal of toxic chemicals.Furthermore, pollution of the environment due to ‘hazardous chemicals’ is notexclusive to ‘developing’ countries.The SAICM brochure refers to an initiative, called the Quick Start Programme,that is intended to assist ‘developing’ countries to better manage chemicals.This would seem to imply that the ‘improper management’ of chemicals is a farmore extensive problem in those regions of the world, and that UNEP ‘experts’know how chemicals should be managed because ‘sound management’ is practiced in‘developed’ countries; but this clearly is not the case, environmental pollutiondue to ‘hazardous chemicals’ is ubiquitous.In addition, the problem of ‘hazardous chemicals’ in ‘developing’ countries doesnot exist solely as a consequence of their low stage of ‘development’; it isalmost entirely due to the continuing production, use and disposal of toxicchemicals with little or no consideration for their detrimental consequences.This is, however, a global problem and largely the result of the increasinglyglobal nature of the chemical industry; as indicated by the SAICM Overview pagethat states,> “The consumption of chemicals by all industries and modern society’s reliance> on chemicals for virtually all manufacturing processes make chemicals> production one of the major and most globalized sectors of the world economy.”It has become increasingly common for large multinational corporations,including those within the chemical industry, to relocate some or all of theirmanufacturing facilities to ‘developing’ countries, primarily to take advantageof less restrictive regulations and lower costs, including cheaper labour, andto therefore increase their profitability. It should be clear that allindustries that produce and utilise ‘hazardous chemicals’ should implementprocedures that ensure their ‘sound management’, regardless of the location ofthe facilities or the existence of safety regulations. It should be equallyclear that the responsibility for all matters that relate to ‘health and safety’lies with the management of the corporations.The disingenuous suggestion that ‘improper management’ is solely due to the‘developing’ nature of the country in which ‘hazardous chemicals’ are produced,can be demonstrated by the example of the tragedy that occurred in 1984 inBhopal, India; an event that is regarded as one of the worst industrialdisasters of the 20th century. Union Carbide Corporation (UCC), a US company,was founded in 1917; Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL) was established in 1934,when UCC ‘invested’ in India and built a factory in Bhopal to manufacturecarbamate pesticides in the belief that India would be a suitable market fortheir product.The web page entitled Union Carbide’s Disaster explains that the pesticidefailed to sell in sufficient quantities to make the business viable and UCILceased active production in the early 1980s. However, for reasons that are notexplained, large volumes of hazardous chemicals remained on the factory site.The page also states that, although some employees remained on the premises,maintenance had fallen into disrepair. On the night of 2nd December 1984, aleakage is reported to have occurred, but the safety systems that were supposedto have prevented such a leak failed to operate. This failure led to the releaseof a huge volume of methyl isocyanate (MIC), a highly toxic gas, into theatmosphere. The result of this leak has been that,> “Half a million people were exposed to the gas and 25,000 have died to date as> a result of their exposure.”The release of this highly toxic gas remains an ongoing problem for thepopulation of Bhopal because, according to the web page,> “The site has never been properly cleaned up and it continues to poison the> residents of Bhopal.”In 2001, Dow Chemical purchased Union Carbide thereby inheriting this situation;however, the web page states that Dow Chemical,> “…has steadfastly refused to clean up the site…”Although categorised as ‘developing’, India has a thriving chemical industry,which is described by the FICCI (Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce andIndustry) as,> “…a critical part of the Indian economy.”Furthermore, India takes the issue of the safe management of chemicals seriouslybecause, according to the page entitled Responsible Care on the website of theIndian Chemical Council,> “The Govt. of India is a signatory to SAICM…”Although the vast majority of the approximately 100,000 chemical substances inuse remain untested, many chemicals that have been tested have been found to beextremely hazardous and to cause many serious adverse health effects. A numberof these hazardous chemicals belong to the group known as POPs, the dangers ofwhich are acknowledged in the UNDP report entitled Chemicals and WasteManagement for Sustainable Development, which states that,> “Exposure to POPs can lead to serious health effects, including certain types> of cancer, birth defects, developmental problems, dysfunctional immune and> reproductive systems, and greater susceptibility to disease.”Although recognising the serious health hazards associated with exposures toPOPs, the report nevertheless makes the claim that,> “Chemical products such as medicines, insecticides, repellents and larvicides> help prevent millions of deaths each year.”This claim is unfounded; these products contain highly toxic chemicalingredients; which means that they contribute to illness and death. The hazardsassociated with ‘medicines’ are demonstrated by the phenomenon of iatrogenesis,as previously discussed; the hazards associated with exposures to all types ofpesticide are well-documented and have also been discussed at length.The report also claims that UNDP, the UN development agency, has helped toeliminate thousands of tonnes of POPs, including DDT. However, as previouslydiscussed, DDT is permitted for use for ‘indoor residual spraying’ inmalaria-endemic countries to control mosquitoes claimed to transmit the malariaparasite. It should be noted that this use of DDT is the only applicationpermitted by the 2004 Stockholm Convention on POPs, on the basis of the claimthat the benefits outweigh the risks. But this claim is unfounded for tworeasons, the first of which is that DDT is not only toxic it is extremelypersistent, which means that it continues to cause harm for years after it hasbeen sprayed inside homes. The second reason is that the theory that malaria iscaused by parasites transmitted by mosquitoes has been shown to be seriouslyflawed. It is therefore, highly questionable whether the use of DDT, even if itdoes kill mosquitoes, can be associated with the prevention of malaria and thereduction of deaths caused by this ‘disease’. This means that the risks faroutweigh the benefits, if there are indeed any benefits.It is clear therefore, that there are many flaws in the claim that the number ofdeaths and illnesses from exposures to ‘hazardous chemicals’ can be reduced bythe implementation of an approach that relies on ‘sound management’ practices.One of the problems with this approach is the reliance on the belief that therecan be a ‘safe’ dose of, or exposure to, any hazardous chemical.The scientific experiments conducted to ascertain the ‘safe’ dose of a chemicaldo not include experiments to tests its effects when combined with otherchemicals to which people are exposed in the real-world environment.Importantly, as has been discussed, some chemicals are known to interactsynergistically; the lack of testing of the majority of the 100,000 or morechemical substances in current use, leaves an immense gap in the knowledgepossessed by the scientific research community about the real nature of the‘hazardous chemicals’ they claim can be made ‘safe’ through the implementationof ‘sound management’ practices.The fundamental problem is that ‘sound management’ practices do not prevent‘hazardous chemicals’ from being manufactured, used and discharged into theenvironment; they do not therefore reduce the environmental pollution thesesubstances generate. These chemicals continue to be included as ingredients of aplethora of products used on a regular, if not daily basis by billions of peopleworldwide.Furthermore, ‘sound management’ practices fail to incorporate the precautionaryprinciple, which states that a chemical substance or product should be proven tobe safe prior to its introduction onto the market. In this context, the wordsafe means absolutely safe, not relatively safe as is currently the case.The incorporation of the precautionary principle into the chemical managementpractices of all industries would provide one part of the solution to theproblem. Another part of the solution is for manufacturers to create productsthat contain non-toxic ingredients; as discussed in chapter ten.Industry & DevelopmentIndustrialisation is claimed to be an important aspect of ‘development’; themore ‘industrialised’ a country, the more ‘developed’ it is said to be. It isalso claimed that many benefits accrue from industrial development; thepopulations of ‘developed’ countries are said to enjoy greater prosperity, abetter standard of living and better health than those of ‘developing’countries; this is, however, a misleading claim.The idea that ‘industrial development’ leads to greater prosperity isdemonstrated by a UNIDO (United Nations Industrial Development Organization)document entitled Introduction to UNIDO that claims,> “Industrialization helped lift hundreds of millions of people around the globe> out of poverty over the last 200 years.”This claim cannot be substantiated; although industrialisation may have providedemployment for millions of people, it has not necessarily lifted them out ofpoverty; as indicated by EF Schumacher, who, in his book entitled Small isBeautiful, states that,> “The result of ‘development’ is that a fortunate minority have their fortunes> greatly increased, while those who really need help are left more helpless> than ever.”The idea that ‘development’ leads to better health is also problematic. Aspreviously discussed, the WHO claims that as a country ‘develops’, the nature ofthe diseases suffered by the population changes from ‘communicable’ to‘noncommunicable’. It should be clear that a change from acute to chronic healthproblems is not indicative of improved health, as NCDs are some of the major‘killer diseases’.Nevertheless, the idea that ‘development’ is the key to ‘progress’ is afundamental aspect of the plans to address the issues that are said to confronthumanity in the 21st century. The Preamble to the previously cited TransformingOur World document that introduces the 2030 Agenda demonstrates this view in thestatement that,> “This Agenda is a plan of action for people, planet and prosperity.”As indicated by its title, the 2030 Agenda emphasises ‘sustainable’ development;it also encourages sustainable ‘industrialisation’, as indicated by SDG 9 thataims to,> “Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable> industrialization and faster innovation.”The countries that were first to embrace the Industrial Revolution and become‘industrialised’ comprise the majority of those categorised as ‘developed’; theremainder of the world’s countries being categorised as ‘developing’. However,the idea that each of the world’s countries can be clearly identified asbelonging solely to one of these two categories according to their level of‘industrialisation’, represents an oversimplification of the nature of corporateoperations in the early 21st century. The trend over the past few decades hasinvolved a rapid acceleration of ‘globalisation’; which means that largecorporations have increasingly expanded their operations across the globe andmany have become huge multinational conglomerates.The complex nature of these multinational organisations precludes an easyidentification of the country to which the ‘industrialised development’ can besaid to belong. This complexity can be demonstrated by the example of the TataGroup, which is described on the web page entitled Tata group Business Profileas,> “…a global enterprise, headquartered in India, comprising 30 companies across> 10 verticals.”Although headquartered in India, the page states that the Tata Group operates inmore than 100 countries across six continents. The ‘verticals’ include: IT;steel; automotive; telecom and media; and tourism and travel. The page reportsthat the revenue of Tata companies for 2017-18 totalled $110.7 billion. Itshould be noted that the Tata Group is only one example of the thrivingindustrialisation currently taking place in India; yet, India continues toretain the status of a ‘developing’ country.Furthermore, industrialisation is not a process that has only recently beenintroduced into India. Indian politician and author, Shashi Tharoor reports inhis book entitled Inglorious Empire, that, at the beginning of the 18th century,> “…India’s share of the world economy was 23 per cent, as large as all of> Europe put together.”The Indian economy of this period comprised various manufacturing industries,including, but not restricted to, textiles, pottery, engineering andshipbuilding. However, the invasion of India by the EIC and the laterincorporation of the country into the British Empire, had a seriouslydetrimental impact on the country; not only was the size of the Indian economysubstantially reduced, but Indian manufacturing became the source of theIndustrial Revolution in Britain; as Shashi Tharoor explains,> “Britain’s Industrial Revolution was built on the destruction of India’s> thriving manufacturing industries.”He also explains that the first industry to suffer destruction by the Britishwas the Indian textile industry, the raw materials of which were used to expandthe British textile industry,> “Ironically, the British used Indian raw materials and exported the finished> products back to India and the rest of the world…”Also ironic is the stark contrast in the early 21st century between the thrivingindustrial development taking place within India and the rapidly decliningindustrial activity within Britain. Although there remain many differencesbetween the two countries, the criteria used to categorise India as ‘developing’and Britain as ‘developed’ are increasingly difficult to discern.In contrast to the claim that many benefits are gained when a country achieves‘industrial development’, is the reality that a variety of adverse consequencesaccompany this ‘progress’. One of the most notable consequences is that thecondition of the environment suffers a decline in quality. As discussed, the WHOrecognises that environmental degradation is a contributory factor to humanmorbidity and mortality, but claims that increased ‘development’ only causes achange in the type of illnesses suffered. The erroneous nature of this idea canbe illustrated by the example of tuberculosis, which is claimed to be acommunicable disease that predominantly affects ‘developing’ countries. However,according to a March 2018 article entitled Tuberculosis rates in England fall bythird in six years,> “The most recent data on infection rates show parts of London still have> higher rates of TB than some developing countries, such as Iraq, Libya and> even Yemen.”This astounding admission demonstrates not only that tuberculosis should not bedescribed as a disease that predominantly affects ‘developing’ countries, butalso that ‘communicable’ diseases continue to have a major impact in ‘developed’countries. The data that show tuberculosis as only occurring in ‘parts ofLondon’ is a further demonstration of the fact that TB is not caused by bacteriathat are transmitted through the air when ‘infected’ people sneeze and expeltheir ‘germs’. In addition, it should be noted that Iraq, Libya and Yemen haveall been severely affected by war during the early 21st century. These conflictshave inevitably had a seriously detrimental impact on the health of thepopulations of those countries; Yemen, for example, is reported to have sufferedan outbreak of cholera that began in October 2016; cholera is discussed in moredetail later in this chapter.One of the many industrial causes of environmental pollution involves theoperations of the extraction industry, which has a very long history in manyparts of the world. These operations, which include mining, smelting andquarrying, are responsible for the release of a wide variety of pollutants intoall parts of the environment; the air, ground and water are all affected. Miningoperations, as discussed, can involve the release of vast quantities ofnaturally-occurring, but highly toxic heavy metals such as lead, mercury andcadmium. It is therefore unsurprising that mining is recognised to beresponsible for a variety of occupational health problems; the nature of theminers’ illnesses will vary according to the nature of the toxic substances towhich they have been exposed. Occupational Knowledge International, (OKInternational) recognises some of these problems and describes, on the About Usweb page, that their work involves efforts to,> “…build capacity in developing countries to identify, monitor, and mitigate> environmental and occupational exposures to hazardous materials in order to> protect public health and the environment.”The website identifies mining as one of the major polluting industries and, onthe page entitled Environmental Impacts of Mining and Smelting, states that,> “The mining sector is responsible for some of the largest releases of heavy> metals into the environment of any industry.”One of the reasons that ‘developing’ countries are increasingly affected bypollution caused by mining, can be attributed to the increasingly commonpractice that involves the relocation of certain aspects of mining operationsfrom ‘developed’ countries to ‘developing’ countries; as described on the webpage, which states that,> “In recent decades, the US has gradually shifted the most polluting aspects of> the mining industry to developing countries.”In addition to being the repositories of some of the polluting activities ofindustries based in ‘developed’ countries, many ‘developing’ countries are alsothe source of a variety of valuable natural resources, such as gold, forexample. This means therefore, that resource-rich ‘developing’ countries willcontinue to be affected by extraction industries, whether owned by nativeindustrialists or those from other countries, until the resources have beendepleted or are no longer commercially viable.It is inevitable therefore, that ‘developing’ countries will continue to sufferenvironmental degradation, especially by extraction industries, and that theirpopulations will continue to suffer the resulting adverse health effects.Unfortunately, health problems due to environmental degradation by theoperations of virtually all industries will, almost certainly, be erroneouslyidentified by the medical establishment as ‘communicable diseases’ that areclaimed to disproportionately affect ‘developing’ countries, and to be treatableor preventable with medicines and vaccines.Also unfortunate is that health problems due to industrial activities in‘developing’ countries are often attributed to inadequate safety procedures,particularly a lack of regulatory controls, which, if implemented, are claimedto be able to ‘mitigate’ problems by the reduction of exposures to hazardousmaterials. However, this idea suffers from the same flaw as the idea that‘hazardous chemicals’ can be made ‘safe’ if they are ‘soundly managed’.The problem with measures aimed at merely ‘controlling’ pollution is that theypermit the continued production and release of pollutants. It is, however, thecontinuing release of pollutants and toxic substances into the environment thatis the major issue. Despite the recognition of the importance of a healthyplanet, establishment organisations do not propose to introduce measures thatwould curtail polluting industrial activities, such as fracking, for example,that cause serious harm to both the environment and human health.Quarrying operations, which involve the extraction of non-metallic substances,also have a long history, and are also associated with occupational healthproblems; as indicated by a 2012 article entitled Effects of Quarry Activitieson Some Selected Communities in the Lower Manya Krobo District of the EasternRegion of Ghana that states,> “A very high degree of respiratory morbidity is associated with this industry.> Fine rock and mineral dust of many kinds have been shown to be carcinogenic> when inhaled.”It is likely that the respiratory health problems experienced by quarry workerswill be identified as one of the less common CRDs (chronic respiratorydiseases), referred to as ‘occupational lung disease’. However, theserespiratory problems are the direct result of the long-term inhalation of rockand mineral dust. As discussed, a ‘poison’ is defined as a substance thatinterferes with normal functioning; which means that, because they interferewith the normal functions of the respiratory system, all types of rock ‘dust’must be described as ‘toxic’. The fact that some types of rock and mineral dustshave been identified as carcinogenic, indicates that they are certainlydetrimental to health.There are many industries that are responsible for the transfer of theirpolluting activities to ‘developing’ countries; including the textile andclothing industry. The two Greenpeace reports referred to in the discussionabout clothes in chapter six, were mainly concerned with environmental pollutioncaused by textile manufacturing facilities in China. But, as mentioned in thatdiscussion, the problem lies with the toxic nature of the materials used by theindustry, which means that the same environmental pollution will be produced byall textile manufacturing facilities that utilise the same manufacturingprocesses and the same toxic substances; the location of the manufacturingfacilities is not a key factor.It is clear, however, that poorly applied safety regulations will certainlyexacerbate the problem, but, as discussed, the failure to adhere to practicesthat protect workers and prevent the discharge of pollutants into thesurrounding environment is not exclusive to ‘developing’ countries. Despitetheir existence in ‘developed’ countries, safety regulations and pollutioncontrols are not a guarantee of safe working conditions or a pollution-freeenvironment, because they are not always fully implemented or rigidly observed.The comparatively weak regulatory systems that exist in ‘developing’ countriesare, however, easier to circumvent; a situation that provides one of theincentives for industries of ‘developed’ countries to relocate their pollutingactivities to other parts of the world.Although said to mainly occur in China, the release of toxic textilemanufacturing wastes into the environment also occurs in other ‘developing’countries; as demonstrated by a July 2015 article entitled Food chain fouled byindustrial waste, which refers to environmental problems in some parts ofBangladesh caused by certain industries, especially dyeing factories, and statesthat,> “For instance, dyeing factories have been set up in many corners of the> country though they usually discharge massive amounts of liquid waste into> nearby canals and rivers without treating them, thus contaminating the water> and the soil.”The nature and causes of environmental pollution are recognised, to a certainextent at least, by some environmental organisations. For example, in 2016 PureEarth and Green Cross Switzerland prepared a report entitled World’s WorstPollution Problems: The Toxics Beneath Our Feet. This report, which will bereferred to as the Pollution report, is the 11th in the annual series thatexposes the most polluting industries in the world. According to the Pollutionreport, the top ten polluting industries in 2016 were: ULAB (used lead acidbattery) recycling; mining and ore processing; lead smelting; tanneries; ASGM(artisanal small-scale gold mining); industrial dumpsites; industrial estates;chemical manufacturing; product manufacturing; and the dye industry. In commonwith many of the problems discussed in this chapter, the countries said to bemost affected by pollution are those categorised as ‘developing’.The ten industries deemed to be the most polluting are ranked according to the‘burden of disease’ with which they are reported to be associated. Although thePollution report claims that the pollutants produced by these industries areonly associated with certain diseases, this is misleading. These pollutants aretoxic and therefore inherently harmful; they are some of the main contributoryfactors to a variety of serious ill-health problems and even death. This is instark contrast to the WHO claim that tobacco, alcohol, unhealthy diet and a lackof exercise are the main ‘risk factors’ for noncommunicable diseases.Significantly, but unsurprisingly, the Pollution report recognises that,> “Chemical manufacturing is a large source of pollution worldwide…”This means therefore, that chemicals are recognised to also be a source ofpollution in ‘developed’ countries, which undermines the UNEP claim that ‘soundmanagement’ practices operate in respect of chemical manufacturing in‘developed’ countries. The Pollution report attributes the causes ofenvironmental pollution to the failure to comply with ‘environmental standards’and states that,> “Due to globalization and efforts to incentivize manufacturing, some countries> have been slow to apply regulations and/or have not been vigorous in ensuring> that companies comply with environmental standards.”The problem of pollution cannot be solved by the introduction of regulations, nomatter how strictly they may be enforced; the problem with ‘regulations’ andtheir failure to ensure the implementation of appropriate protections for peopleand the environment are further discussed in chapter nine. It must beemphasised, however, that most regulations rely on the erroneous idea that it ispossible to establish a ‘safe’ level of exposure to a toxic substance.The increasingly common practice of relocating polluting industrial operationsto ‘developing’ countries owes its origin largely to the escalation of‘globalisation’, under which it is claimed that industrial development willgenerate ‘benefits’ for ‘developing’ countries and their populations. However,in reality, the populations of these countries rarely benefit from any of thepurported advantages, but invariably suffer from the many detrimentalconsequences, not least of which are the adverse health effects that accompanyenvironmental pollution.However, the governments of some ‘developing’ countries have welcomed industrialrelocations, in the belief that the influx of capital investment will generatebenefits for the local population by providing them with employment, which willimprove their standard of living to a level similar to that believed to beenjoyed by the populations of ‘developed’ countries. In his book entitled GreenBacklash Andrew Rowell explains that,> “Third World governments, lured by the illusion of trickle-down capital and> tempted by the dreams of technology transfer, have actually encouraged this> corporate and capital flight into the deregulated zone, by setting them up in> their own countries.”The nature of such ‘deregulated zones’ means that they certainly generatebenefits, but these are enjoyed almost exclusively by the corporations, with thecountry, its people and environment suffering the consequences; as he alsoexplains,> “…numerous countries have established free trade zones (FTZs) or export> processing zones (EPZs) which offer lax or non-existent environmental> legislation, lenient or non-existent tax regimes and ridiculously low wage> costs from underpaid non-unionised workers.”In addition, he quotes the words of environmentalist Paul Hawken who anticipatesthat the effects of the continuing globalisation of industrial development willbe,> “…that the world becomes a large, non-unionised hiring hall, with poorer> countries lining up for plum investments, willing to donate land, resources> and environmental quality and cheap labour as their cost of achieving economic> ‘development’.”One of the main ‘costs’ of the welcome afforded to industrialisation by‘developing’ countries will be deteriorating health, which, in ‘developing’countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, will be erroneously attributed to‘communicable’ diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, the threemajor ‘epidemics’ to be ended by 2030. The real nature of these diseases hasbeen discussed, and shown to be attributable to a wide variety of toxins thatinclude pharmaceutical medicines and vaccines used in the prevention andtreatment of disease. Environmental pollution from industrial activities alsoneeds to be recognised for its detrimental impact on health.In addition to the pollution that results from industrial operations, is thepollution that results from the disposal of wastes, including the disposal ofproducts at the end of their useful lives. One of the main methods of dealingwith waste involves its disposal into huge landfill sites that are extremelyhazardous as well as unsightly. Target 5 of SDG 12 recognises the problemscaused by waste and aims to,> “By 2030, substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction,> recycling and reuse.”There are many forms of ‘waste’; these range from plastic containers and foodwrapping to liquid and food wastes to large household machines and equipment, toname just a few. Although waste recycling is clearly preferable to disposal intolandfill sites, the reference to ‘prevention’ is even more significant, asprevention avoids the problem occurring in the first place. Furthermore,emphasis on prevention would place greater responsibility onto manufacturers tocreate products that are not hazardous and do not pollute the environment,either during or at the end of their useful lives. Unfortunately, mostmanufacturing industries have yet to understand the importance of ‘prevention’.The disposal of the products of some of the fastest growing industries, mostnotably the electronics and telecommunications industries, is a major source ofenvironmental pollution, because they invariably contain hazardous materials,especially heavy metals and rare earths, as previously discussed. Althoughhazardous, these materials are valuable, which has encouraged the establishmentof operations to recycle ‘electronic waste’, also referred to as e-waste.Unfortunately, these recycling operations are almost invariably located in‘developing’ countries; which further exacerbates environmental degradation andworsening health problems in these regions. The volume of e-waste is immense, asis its value; as indicated by a May 2015 article entitled Illegally Traded andDumped E-Waste Worth up to $19 Billion Annually Poses Risks to Health, DeprivesCountries of Resources, Says UNEP Report, which states that,> “Each year, the electronic industry – one of the world’s largest and fastest> growing – generates up to 41 million tonnes of e-waste from goods such as> computers and smart phones.”As the electronics and telecommunications industries continue to grow, theproblem of e-waste will inevitably worsen for ‘developing’ countries; as thearticle states,> “Africa and Asia are key destinations for large-scale shipments of hazardous> wastes for dumping, and sometimes for recycling.”The impact on human health resulting from the processing of e-waste thatcontains hazardous materials is discussed in a 2017 article entitled Toward aMore Sustainable Trajectory for E-Waste Policy: A Review of a Decade of E-WasteResearch in Accra, Ghana. Although the article refers to the situation in onlyone region of Ghana, it summarises the types of problems that are common to alle-waste recycling operations,> “Weak e-waste regulations and limited use of safety measures for e-waste> workers in Accra, Ghana, foster an exploitative environment within the> industry, and pose health risks for those working and living near e-waste> processing sites.”The article also refers to the phenomenon of ‘built-in obsolescence’, which isan increasingly common attribute of electronic equipment and is clearlybeneficial for the manufacturer. In addition, the manufacturers of electronicproducts, especially mobile phones, continually introduce new versions of theirdevices, the sole purpose of which is to generate a major boost to sales andprofits. But the manufacturers benefit at the expense of the environment,especially as they are not held responsible for the safe disposal of theproducts they produce; as the article states,> “Electronics producers lack accountability in solving the e-waste> predicament.”The lack of accountability, or responsibility, of the manufacturers of goods andproducts that contain toxic materials, is a fundamental aspect of environmentalpollution and the associated adverse health effects for all living organisms, aswell as humans. It must be noted that the expansion of the electronics industryhas also increased the levels of electromagnetic radiation in the environment,which, if 5G technology is implemented globally, will substantially increase thehazards to human health.It is natural for people in ‘developing’ countries to want their countries to‘develop’; but if these countries introduce the same type of ‘industrialdevelopment’ that exists in ‘developed’ countries, they will experience the samelevels of environmental pollution and suffer the same adverse healthconsequences. Although the health problems that prevail in ‘developed’ countriesare called NCDs, they are predominantly caused by exposures to toxic pollutants,whether chemical or electromagnetic in origin.It is possible for countries to develop without the accompanying adverse effectson the environment or human health. The quote by Barry Commoner that opens thischapter is pertinent in this context and bears repetition,> “Economic development can proceed without a concomitant decrease in> environmental quality if it is based on an appropriate, ecologically benign> production technology.”The challenge for the innovators of the 21st century is to develop methods bywhich products can be created utilising non-toxic materials and benigntechnologies; there are signs that this challenge has been accepted andnon-toxic products are being developed. The most significant contribution thatthe general public can make is to change their purchasing habits and to create ademand for non-toxic products.PovertyPoverty is one of the major issues that confront humanity in the 21st century;it is an issue of such significance that the previously cited Transforming OurWorld document contains the following bold statement,> “We are committed to ending poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including> by eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.”The term ‘extreme poverty’ is defined as living below the ‘international povertyline’, which, when the 2030 Agenda was prepared, was an income of $1.25 per day;as indicated by target 1 of SDG 1 that states the aim to,> “By 2030, eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently> measured as people living on less than $1.25 a day.”In October 2015, however, the World Bank amended the ‘international povertyline’ to $1.90 per day; an amendment that inevitably increased the number ofpeople categorised as living in ‘extreme poverty’.The World Bank, which was established as the result of the 1944 Bretton Woodsconference, is a ‘specialised agency’ of the UN. The World Bank mission,according to the web page entitled Who We Are, is comprised of two goals, thefirst of which is,> “To end extreme poverty: by reducing the share of the global population that> lives in extreme poverty to 3 percent by 2030.”Although a reduction in the number of people living in ‘extreme poverty’ to only3 per cent of the world population would be an achievement, this cannot beregarded as synonymous with the ‘end’ of extreme poverty. The section of theWorld Bank website that relates to Data Topics provides information about eachof the 17 SDGs. The web page that refers to SDG 1, entitled No poverty, claimsthat, in 1990, 1.8 billion people lived in ‘extreme poverty’, but indicates thisnumber has been reduced because,> “An estimated 766 million people, or 10.7 percent of the world’s population,> lived in extreme poverty in 2013.”The region claimed to be most affected by ‘extreme poverty’ is sub-SaharanAfrica.In common with most statistics, those that relate to the number of people livingin poverty are compiled from data that are collected through a sample ofsurveys, and then extrapolated using computer modelling techniques to apply tothe entire population. Although surveys are common sources of data forstatistics, the information they provide may not accurately reflect the realconditions of life experienced by the population. The problems associated withthe poverty statistics of the World Bank are highlighted by Professor MichelChossudovsky PhD in his book entitled Globalization of Poverty and the New WorldOrder, in which he states that,> “Poverty assessments by the World Bank and the United Nations are largely> office- based exercises conducted in Washington and New York, with> insufficient awareness of local realities.”This situation certainly raises questions about the poverty statistics quoted byUN organisations. Furthermore, an October 2015 World Bank press release entitledWorld Bank’s New End-Poverty Tool: Surveys in Poorest Countries makes arevealing admission about the paucity of actual data collected in the statementthat,> “Poverty-fighting efforts have long been constrained by a lack of data in many> countries.”The extent of the problem is reported in the press release to be that, duringthe period between 2002 and 2011, there were no poverty data for 29 countriesand that, during the same period, only one poverty survey had been conducted ineach of a further 28 countries. The almost total lack of poverty data availablefrom these 57 countries, which together represent almost 30 per cent of thetotal of 195 countries, is so significant that it directly challenges theveracity of the poverty statistics claimed to accurately reflect the conditionsfor people who live in the poorest countries.In addition to being categorised according to the stage of development they haveachieved, countries are also categorised according to their level of ‘income’; acriterion that is based on World Bank calculations of GNI (gross nationalincome) per capita. As previous discussions have indicated, there are four‘income’ groups; namely low, lower-middle, upper-middle and high. Although GNImay be a reasonable representation of a country’s total income, the ‘per capita’amount merely represents an averaging calculation; but one that does notrealistically represent the actual incomes earned by the population of thecountry. Interestingly, even the World Bank recognises that the measure of ‘GNIper capita’ has limitations, one of which is that it does not reflect incomeinequalities within a country; ‘GNI per capita’ also fails to indicate theactual incomes earned at each extremity.The extent of income inequalities can be demonstrated by two examples. The firstexample involves the US, which is categorised as a ‘high income’ country and isthe home of a large number of millionaires and an increasing number ofbillionaires. Yet America is a country of contradictions; as indicated by aDecember 2017 report issued by the US Department of Housing and UrbanDevelopment that claimed the existence of more than half a million homelessAmerican people, which represented an increase over the number for the previousyear.The second example involves India, which is categorised as a ‘lower-middleincome’ country and is the home of many millions of people who live in a stateof extreme poverty. Yet India is also a country of contradictions; there aremore than two hundred thousand Indians who are rupee millionaires, as reportedin a July 2015 article entitled 61,000 millionaires left India in the last 14years. Although rupee millionaires are not dollar millionaires, the article alsoreports the existence of a growing number of rupee billionaires, whose wealthdoes equate to millions of dollars.The Transforming Our World document recognises the problem of inequalities inthe statement that,> “We resolve, between now and 2030, to end poverty and hunger everywhere; to> combat inequalities within and among countries…”The examples discussed above that relate to the US and India demonstrate,however, that income inequalities within countries are not being addressed. Inreality, the ‘wealth gap’ that exists within these and virtually all othercountries around the world is not narrowing; instead it is continuing to widenand at an increasingly rapid pace. This situation is one that poses yet anotherserious challenge to the claim that the number of people living in ‘extremepoverty’ has been substantially reduced.It is often argued that poverty is ‘relative’ and varies with respect to certainfactors, not least of which is the country in which it is said to exist; thisargument is incorporated into target 2 of SDG 1 that states the aim to,> “By 2030, reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of> all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national> definitions.”The relevance of ‘national definitions’ is illustrated by ProfessorChossudovsky, who cites in his book that the ‘poverty threshold’ in the US in1996 was $16,036 for a family of 2 adults and 2 children, which equates toalmost $11 per person per day. This amount greatly exceeds the 2015‘international poverty line’; but it was considered to be an amount thatrepresented ‘poverty’ for an American family in the 1990s.It is clear that poverty, although mainly referred to with respect to a sum ofmoney or a level of income expressed as a daily amount, in reality, has a muchwider meaning. In this wider context, ‘poverty’ more accurately represents aninability to access ‘basic needs’, the most important of which are food andwater, without which life cannot be sustained.However, there are other requirements considered to be ‘basic needs’ that alsovary according to ‘national definitions’, as described in SDG 1.2. This point isalso explained by the World Bank No poverty web page that states,> “National poverty lines typically reflect a threshold below which a person’s> minimum nutrition, clothing, and shelter needs cannot be met, consistent with> the country’s economic and social circumstances.”It is these ‘circumstances’ that are said to justify the different ‘povertylines’ that apply to different regions and even different countries around theworld.The expansion of ‘globalisation’, however, has meant that there are far fewerdifferences in the economic circumstances that prevail in different regions ofthe world. One of the most significant effects of globalisation has been onprices, and especially the price of food, one of life’s most important ‘basicneeds’. The problem is explained by Professor Chossudovsky who states that,> “Increasingly, the domestic prices of food staples are brought up to their> world market levels.”The consequence of increased food prices without a corresponding increase inincome is an inevitable deepening of poverty; as explained by Ellen Brown in herFebruary 2011 article entitled The Egyptian Tinderbox: How Banks and Investorsare Starving the Third World, in which she states that,> “In poorer countries, as much as 60 to 80 percent of people’s incomes go for> food compared to just 10 to 20 percent in industrialised countries.”Although food is one of the most important, it is not the only ‘basic need’, noris it the only commodity that has continued to increase in price. Clearly,increased prices on their own are not necessarily problematic; it is only whenprice increases occur in the absence of increased income that there are seriousconsequences; a situation that has become increasingly common with theimposition of policies that demand a freeze on wages. Yet the prices of basicnecessities have been permitted to increase; as indicated by ProfessorChossudovsky in his June 2008 article entitled The Global Crisis: Food, Waterand Fuel. Three Fundamental Necessities of Life in Jeopardy, in which he statesthat,> “In recent years, the prices of these three variables have increased> dramatically at the global level, with devastating economic and social> consequences.”Poverty can also produce devastating consequences for health; the WHO web pageentitled Poverty and health states that,> “Poverty creates ill-health because it forces people to live in environments> that make them sick, without decent shelter, clean water or adequate> sanitation.”This statement is, however, rather misleading. Although it correctly identifiesthe existence of a link between unhealthy environments and illness, it fails tocorrectly identify the main factors that contribute to those unhealthyenvironments, as it fails to acknowledge the role of environmental pollutantsand contaminants produced by industrial activities.The World Bank also refers to an association between a lack of money and a lackof health on a page with the same title, Poverty and health, which states that,> “Poverty is a major cause of ill health and a barrier to accessing health care> when needed. This relationship is financial; the poor cannot afford to> purchase those things that are needed for good health, including sufficient> quantities of quality food and health care.”This statement is also rather misleading. Although it correctly identifies‘quality food’, the World Bank uses this term mainly with reference to the‘energy’ content of food, rather than its nutritional content. Furthermore, theWorld Bank use of the term ‘health care’ refers to the services provided by themedical establishment system that employs medicines and vaccines, which, asdemonstrated throughout this book, are not requirements for ‘good health’.The WHO expands on the idea that an association exists between poverty andillness in the claim that poverty in ‘developing’ countries is a majorcontributory factor to ‘infectious diseases’; as indicated by the previouslycited Global Report for Research on Infectious Diseases of Poverty that definesthe term ‘infectious diseases of poverty’ as referring to,> “…a number of diseases which are known to be more prevalent among poorer> populations…”The reason these diseases predominantly affect ‘poor’ people is erroneouslyclaimed in the report to be that,> “Poverty creates conditions that favour the spread of infectious diseases and> prevents affected populations from obtaining adequate access to prevention and> care.”The failure of the medical establishment to investigate the true nature andcauses of ‘disease’, combined with the rigid adherence to the fatally flawed‘germ theory’, means that they are unable to provide effective methods ofprevention or treatment for the illnesses that are said to predominantly affectpoor people; this failure is demonstrated by the statement in the report that,> “Research has revealed that the control of infectious diseases of poverty is> more complex than previously thought.”The consequences of the erroneous medical establishment theories relating to thecauses of the illnesses that affect poor people are explained in the report tobe that,> “Social, economic and biological factors interact to drive a vicious cycle of> poverty and disease from which, for many people, there is ‘no escape’.”Until the medical establishment relinquishes the belief in ‘biological factors’and the ‘germ theory’, they will continue to fail to resolve this vicious cycle.It has been demonstrated that one of the factors that exert a major influenceover human health is the condition of the environment in which people live; thishas been recognised by the previously cited Healthy Environments report.However, contrary to the claims of the WHO, unhealthy environments, as well aspoverty and disease, also exist in most, if not all ‘developed’ countries; theseconditions are not exclusive to ‘developing’ countries. There are, however,reasons that these conditions are more prevalent in ‘developing’ countries; inmost instances the reasons owe their origins to the fact that these countriesare former colonies; as indicated by Dr Barry Commoner, whose words were quotedat the beginning of this chapter, but deserve repetition,> “...a fact about developing countries that is often forgotten: they once were,> and in the economic sense often still remain, colonies of more developed> countries.”As previously discussed, colonialism invariably involved widespread exploitationof the natural resources and indigenous populations of colonies. The nature ofthe exploitation varied, but often entailed the expulsion of the indigenouspeople from their land, and the subsequent transformation of that land fromtraditional agriculture into plantations of single crops, such as coffee andsugar for example, grown specifically for the export market. This foreign‘ownership’ of the land and the resources it contained, including valuablemetals, such as gold in South Africa for example, not only restricted the volumeof food produced for domestic consumption, it also hampered the countries’efforts to ‘industrialise’ and therefore to ‘develop’. The result of theseexploitative actions has been the continued impoverishment of the indigenouspopulations; as succinctly described by Eduardo Galeano in Open Veins of LatinAmerica, in which he states that,> “...we Latin Americans are poor because the ground we tread is rich...”One of the reasons that poverty continues to persist throughout the world is dueto the nature of the ‘international monetary system’ and the bankers andindustrialists who virtually control that system. The ‘world money system’ isdiscussed in chapter nine, but requires some discussion in this section in thecontext of its effect on poverty, which, in contrast to the World Bank claim, isworsening, not improving.At the end of WWII, most European countries were in debt as the result of themilitary expenditures they incurred during the war. One of the countries thatemerged from that period virtually unscathed financially was the United Statesof America, which had been one of the main providers of loans to many of theEuropean combatants in WWII. The US was therefore in a very strong financialposition; a situation that was to be exploited by the wealthiest and mostinfluential bankers and industrialists, who desired the goal of making the USthe dominant ‘world power’.One of the earliest mechanisms by which they sought to achieve their goalinvolved the creation of the Marshall Plan that was to provide ‘aid’ tocountries in western Europe in order to enable ‘reconstruction’. However, this‘aid’ was always subject to certain conditions, one of which was the requirementfor the recipient country to ‘open’ its markets to US products; a situation thatprovided a significant boost to American industries. The details of the MarshallPlan are explained by F. William Engdahl in his book entitled Gods of Money:Wall Street and the Death of the American Century, in which he states that,> “The Marshall Plan also opened the way for large US corporations to invest in> the industries of Western Europe at bargain prices as European currencies were> heavily depreciated in dollar terms after 1945 under the parities set under> initial IMF rules in relation to the dollar.”The IMF is another specialised agency of the UN, which, like the World Bank, wasestablished as the result of the 1944 Bretton Woods conference; the IMF websiteclaims that its primary purpose is,> “...to ensure the stability of the international monetary system...”This purpose is further explained on the web page entitled How the IMF PromotesGlobal Economic Stability that states,> “Promoting economic stability is partly a matter of avoiding economic and> financial crises...”Since the formation of the IMF, there have been many economic and financialcrises that have increased in intensity, which indicates that the IMF has failedto implement the appropriate measures to achieve ‘economic stability’ and avoidcrises. The IMF claims that its other functions are to,> “…facilitate international trade, promote high employment and sustainable> growth, and reduce poverty around the world.”It is interesting to note that the facilitation of international trade is listedbefore the reduction of poverty.During the post-WWII period, many colony countries sought to gain theirindependence, especially from Britain, France and Germany, all three of whichhad emerged from the war with a significant level of debt and were no longerable to afford the costs of administering their colonies. In addition, therewere many other countries, both ‘developing’ and ‘developed’, that had alsoaccumulated large debts, for which they required assistance from thenewly-created IMF and World Bank.Under the guise of assisting these countries to achieve ‘economic stability’,the loans provided by the IMF and World Bank required the recipients to acceptthe imposition of certain conditions, including the implementation of structuraladjustment programmes (SAPs). But, according to Professor Chossudovsky, theseSAPs have not generated improved economic stability; instead they have,> “...contributed largely to destabilizing national currencies and ruining the> economies of developing countries.”In addition, he states that these programmes have,> “...led to the impoverishment of hundreds of millions of people.”The SAPs have clearly failed to achieve their intended purpose but instead, haveachieved the complete opposite. Professor Chossudovsky states that,> “…since the early 1990s…the IMF-World Bank policy prescriptions (now imposed> in the name of ‘poverty alleviation’) have become increasingly harsh and> unyielding.”One of the harsh and unyielding policies that have become increasingly common inmost countries around the world, especially after the financial crisis of2007-2008, has involved the imposition of austerity measures. These measureshave been imposed on ‘developed’ as well as ‘developing’ countries and have ledto the impoverishment of unknown millions of people around the world; asituation that clearly raises fundamental questions about the World Bank claimthat more than a billion people were lifted out of the condition of ‘extremepoverty’ between 1990 and 2013.It is generally claimed that employment is one of the key processes by whichpeople can lift themselves out of poverty or extreme poverty; however, even theUN acknowledges that this is not necessarily the case. The page about SDG 1 onthe UN website provides a section entitled Progress of Goal 1 in 2017 thatstates,> “In 2016, just under 10 per cent of the world’s workers were living with their> families on less than $1.90 per person per day…”Although the UN claims this represents a reduction from 28 per cent in 2000, itis an outrage that people who have employment income nevertheless live in‘extreme poverty’. One of the main causes of this appalling situation are thelow wages paid by some of the multinational corporations that relocate to‘developing’ countries with the specific intention of taking advantage of lowercosts, lax regulations and the virtual absence of labour unions, or any otherorganisations that would protect the rights of workers to earn a decent livingwage.As discussed above, one of the conditions of the SAPs imposed by the IMF andWorld Bank prior to providing financial ‘aid’, is that the country implements apolicy that ensures wages are kept at a low level. The argument used by theseinstitutions to justify this policy is that wage increases are inflationary andcause harm to the country’s economy. However, the prices of ‘basic needs’ suchas food, are permitted and even encouraged to increase to market levels, despitethe ‘low wage’ policy; a situation that inevitably exacerbates poverty and is,therefore, in direct contradiction to the stated aims of the UN organisations toreduce poverty and eradicate extreme poverty.A further consequence of the relocation of the manufacturing facilities ofmultinational corporations to ‘developing’ countries, are the difficultiesexperienced by small local businesses; as they are unable to compete and areoften forced to close; as Professor Chossudovsky explains,> “In developing countries entire branches of industry producing for the> internal market are driven into bankruptcy...”These business failures significantly add to the problem of poverty as theowners of failed businesses and their employees become unemployed and are forcedto accept poorly-paid employment, which is often insufficient to meet their‘basic needs’. These people therefore bolster the numbers living in poverty andeven in ‘extreme poverty’. Yet this situation is entirely avoidable; it has onlybeen brought about by globalisation policies that favour ‘international trade’conducted by huge multinational conglomerates.The ongoing and deepening economic crises that affect virtually all countriesaround the world in the early 21st century pose serious challenges to the UNefforts to fulfil the goal of ending poverty before 2030. It should be clearthat, in order to achieve this goal, the existing policies of UN institutions,especially the IMF and World Bank, must be abandoned and replaced with thosethat genuinely address the problem of poverty.The policies imposed by the IMF and World Bank in the name of ‘economicstability’ also have a profound effect on human health. Many of the smallbusinesses that have been driven into bankruptcy, have included local foodproducers and suppliers that have been replaced by multinational foodmanufacturers, supermarkets and ‘fast-food’ chains that predominantly supplyprocessed ‘food products’, which contain few, if any, real nutrients. Althoughthese ‘food products’ are cheap in terms of their money cost, they are expensivein terms of their adverse impact on health.Hunger & MalnutritionHunger, like poverty, is one of the major issues said to confront humanity inthe early 21st century; as indicated by the Transforming Our World document thatstates,> “We resolve, between now and 2030, to end poverty and hunger everywhere…”Hunger and its associated problems are the topics of SDG 2, the aim of which isto,> “End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote> sustainable agriculture.”Agriculture and food security are discussed in the next section.The terms ‘hunger’ and ‘malnutrition’ are closely related but not synonymous.Although the word ‘hunger’ is commonly used to express a desire to eat, itsmeaning in the context of this discussion refers to an insufficient intake offood over a long period of time. The aim of SDG 2.1 is to,> “By 2030, end hunger and ensure access by all people, in particular the poor> and people in vulnerable situations, including infants, to safe, nutritious> and sufficient food all year round.”Hunger almost invariably coexists with poverty, especially in the presence ofrising food prices that are not matched by increased incomes. This combinationis increasingly prevalent in ‘developed’, as well as ‘developing’, countries asthe global economic conditions in the early 21st century continue to worsen.Although financial assistance is provided by the IMF and the World Bank, it isalways accompanied by conditions that require the imposition of harsh austeritymeasures that fail to address the real problems, and therefore fail to achieve areduction in either poverty or hunger. Nevertheless, on a web page entitledProgress of Goal 2 in 2017, the UN claims that,> “Efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition have advanced significantly since> 2000.”This is, however, contradicted by the previously cited September 2017 WFP PressRelease entitled World Hunger Again On The Rise, Driven By Conflict And ClimateChange, New UN Report Says that states,> “After steadily declining for over a decade, global hunger is on the rise> again…”The UN report referred to in the press release is entitled The state of foodsecurity and nutrition in the world; it was produced jointly by FAO, IFAD(International Fund for Agricultural Development), WHO, WFP and UNICEF, all ofwhich are organisations within the UN system. The report, which will be referredto as the Food Security report, claims that conflicts are one of the key driversof worsening hunger. In addition, although incorrectly attributed to ‘climatechange’, extreme weather conditions, such as droughts and floods, are recognisedto adversely influence food production; they are also acknowledged to beinfluenced by the regular occurrence of the climate phenomenon known as El Niño.The report indicates that the current economic situation, which is referred toas an ‘economic slowdown’, has adversely impacted food availability and causedfood prices to increase. These factors are all claimed to affect ‘foodsecurity’, which in turn has an impact on hunger and malnutrition; the FoodSecurity report recognises the connections between these factors and statesthat,> “…we will not end hunger and all forms of malnutrition by 2030 unless we> address all the factors that undermine food security and nutrition.”These problems, like all others, cannot be solved unless their underlying causeshave been correctly identified; unfortunately, UN organisations have failed tounderstand the underlying nature of the problems and correctly identify theircauses. This means they are unlikely to be able to eliminate or evensubstantially reduce hunger and malnutrition.The correct definition of the word malnutrition is ‘bad nutrition’, which, aspreviously discussed, can occur in people who eat a sufficient quantity of food;it is for this reason that malnutrition is not synonymous with ‘hunger’.Malnutrition is the topic of SDG 2.2 that states the aim to,> “By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the> internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5> years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant> and lactating women and older persons.”Stunting and wasting are the result of malnutrition; they are conditions thatprimarily affect children in ‘developing’ countries who are severelymalnourished during the most important stages of their growth, or even prior totheir birth. These children fail to thrive because they do not consume foodswith all the nutrients necessary for the proper functioning and development oftheir bodies. However, ‘malnutrition’ is not restricted to children or evenadults who live in ‘developing’ countries; it affects anyone whose diet iscomprised of nutrient-poor foods, even if the quantity of food is sufficient toprevent ‘hunger’. The February 2018 WHO fact sheet entitled Malnutrition claimsthat,> “Malnutrition refers to deficiencies, excesses, or imbalances in a person’s> intake of energy and/or nutrients.”As previously discussed, this claim is misleading; the ‘energy’ value of a foodis not related to its nutritional value. Some of the consequences ofmalnutrition are described in the fact sheet that states,> “Malnutrition, in all its forms, includes undernutrition (wasting, stunting,> underweight), inadequate vitamins or minerals, overweight, obesity, and> resulting diet-related noncommunicable diseases.”The fact sheet identifies overweight and obesity as conditions that can resultfrom ‘malnutrition’ but claims that,> “Overweight and obesity result from an imbalance between energy consumed (too> much) and energy expended (too little).”This explanation places too great an emphasis on a food’s ‘energy’ value, asmeasured in calories, that must be balanced by an adequate level of physicalactivity to prevent overweight and obesity; although commonly assumed to becorrect, this view is mistaken; nutrition is discussed in more detail in chapterten.One of the main reasons that the incidence of overweight and obesity continuesto rise is because dietary habits have changed; large numbers of people nolonger consume nutrient-rich foods, they have replaced their traditional foodswith nutrient-poor processed ‘food products’ that are not conducive to goodhealth. This is not a situation that exists solely in ‘developed’ countries; itis increasingly a global phenomenon, as the fact sheet states,> “Globally, people are consuming foods and drinks that are more energy-dense> (high in sugars and fats) …”The changing nature of diets is also recognised by the Food Security report,which makes the revealing comment that,> “As large companies increasingly dominate markets, highly processed foods> become more readily available, and traditional foods and eating habits are> displaced.”It is important to note that, although the WHO contributed to this report, whichis critical of ‘processed food products’, it is a core member of JECFA, theorganisation that approves chemical food additives as suitable for use in ‘foodproducts’ that are becoming ‘more readily available’ in countries where hungerand malnutrition are common. This situation is also recognised in the February2018 WHO fact sheet entitled Obesity and overweight, which states thatunderweight is a more significant problem than overweight for children in‘developing’ countries but that,> “At the same time, these children are exposed to high-fat, high-sugar,> high-salt, energy-dense, and micronutrient-poor foods, which tend to be lower> in cost, but also lower in nutrient quality.”The reference to these foods as ‘energy-dense’ means that they providesufficient calories, but their almost total lack of nutrients contributes to‘malnutrition’, whether the child suffers from underweight or overweight.However, as the WHO recognises, these ‘food products’ are invariably lower incost than nutrient-rich foods, which is one of the reasons that they appeal topeople who live in poverty. It also explains why malnutrition and poverty oftenco-exist, as the Malnutrition fact sheet states,> “Poverty amplifies the risk of, and risks from, malnutrition.”It should be abundantly obvious that a diet comprised of low-cost ‘foodproducts’ that are energy-dense, but low in nutrients will not solve the problemof malnutrition. Instead, a diet of this nature will exacerbate existing healthproblems and lead to overweight in the presence of malnutrition, as indicated bythe Overweight and obesity fact sheet that states,> “It is not uncommon to find undernutrition and obesity co-existing within the> same country, the same community and the same household.”The WHO refers to different nutrients, such as vitamins and minerals, and alsoto ‘micronutrients’, which are defined on the web page entitled Micronutrientsas substances that are essential, but required in only miniscule amounts; thepage also states that,> “As tiny as the amounts are, however, the consequences of their absence are> severe.”However, the WHO makes the further claim that,> “Iodine, vitamin A and iron are most important in global public health terms;> their lack represents a major threat to the health and development of> populations the world over…”Although important, these are neither the only nor the most important nutrients,the lack of which pose a major threat to health; many other nutrients areequally, if not more important. More significantly, nutrients should not beconsidered in isolation. Yet the WHO, the agency responsible for human health,fails to provide adequate information about a major factor that influenceshealth. The reason that the medical establishment has a poor level of knowledgeabout this extremely important topic is due to the almost total lack of medicalschool training on the subject of nutrition.Ill-health is not uncommon in people, especially children, who are underweight,although the health problems they suffer are often erroneously categorised as‘infections’, as the previously cited Global Health Risks report indicates,> “Around one third of diarrhoea, measles, malaria and lower respiratory> infections in childhood are attributable to underweight.”This statement is highly misleading. The ‘germ theory’ attributes infections topathogenic microorganisms, not to underweight. There is, however, no explanationoffered for the claim that only one third of these ‘infectious diseases’ areattributable to underweight; if underweight were a causal factor, it would applyin all cases.Malnutrition that manifests as underweight is not only a problem for children,it can also be problematic for pregnant women and their developing babies, asindicated by the WHO web page entitled, 10 facts on nutrition, ‘fact’ number 5of which states,> “Maternal undernutrition, common in many developing countries, leads to poor> fetal development and higher risk of pregnancy complications...”Malnutrition that manifests as overweight, in both ‘developed’ and ‘developing’countries, can be similarly problematic for pregnant women and their developingbabies.Maternal malnutrition, whether it manifests as underweight or overweight, canalso affect the health of the baby after birth. Nursing mothers need to beadequately nourished otherwise the quality of the milk can be reduced, whichwill inevitably affect the health of the baby. The WHO recommends that babiesshould be exclusively breastfed for at least the first six months of life, afterwhich it is recommended that they should be introduced to ‘complementary’ orfamily foods, in addition to the continuation of breastfeeding. Despite thisrecommendation, the February 2018 WHO fact sheet entitled Infant and young childfeeding admits that,> “Few children receive nutritionally adequate and safe complementary foods...”According to the fact sheet, the main reason for this is due to a lack of‘dietary diversity’ and a lack of ‘feeding frequency’, for which the WHOrecommends that children are fed more frequently with a variety of complementaryfoods that are nutritionally adequate. Whilst this is clearly good advice,families that live in extreme poverty are unlikely to be able to follow it. Itis widely recognised that ‘undernourishment’, especially in ‘developing’countries, is a serious problem that requires attention. The main UNorganisation tasked with providing food assistance is WFP (World FoodProgramme), which also, inevitably, promotes the 2030 Agenda goal to ‘endhunger’.The WFP recognises that nutrition is important and that malnutrition canmanifest as underweight or overweight; however, like the WHO, the WFP does nothave a full understanding of ‘nutrition’ and places too great an emphasis on the‘energy’ value of foods. The nature of the WFP’s work includes humanitarianassistance and the provision of food aid during disasters, such as famines anddroughts; however, these emergency situations are not the sole focus of theiractivities. The WFP also provides assistance through a number of programmes thatinvolve the distribution of a variety of products, as indicated by the web pageentitled Specialized nutritious foods that states,> “The World Food Programme (WFP) uses a wide range of specialized foods to> improve the nutritional intake of the people we assist around the world.”These products include: Fortified Blended Foods (FBFs); Ready-to-Use Foods(RUFs); High Energy Biscuits (HEBs); Micronutrient Powder or ‘Sprinkles’; andCompressed Food Bars. A few examples will suffice to indicate the real nature ofthese ‘products’ that WFP refers to as ‘foods’. The first products, calledFortified Blended Foods, are described on the web page as,> “...blends of partially precooked and milled cereals, soya, beans, pulses,> fortified with micronutrients (vitamins and minerals).”The main type of FBF used in WFP programmes is called CSB (Corn Soya Blend),although WSB (Wheat Soya Blend) is also sometimes used. The next products,referred to as Ready-to-Use Foods, are described as likely to contain,> “...vegetable fat, dry skimmed milk, malt dextrin, sugar and whey...”One variety of RUF, called ‘Plumpy’, contains peanut paste. The third products,called High Energy Biscuits, are listed as having the following ingredients,> “Wheat flour, Hydrogenate Vegetable Shortening, Sugar, Soyflour, Invert Syrup,> High fructose Corn Syrup, Skimmed Milk powder, Sodium and Ammonium,> Bicarbonates, Salt…”It should be clear from the descriptions and ingredient listings that these areall highly processed ‘food products’ that contain unhealthy ingredients,including sugar and salt. Although claimed to be ‘fortified’ with vitamins andminerals, these products clearly do not contain the full range of nutrientsrequired by the body to function optimally; it is therefore inappropriate todescribe these products as ‘nutritious foods’.The use of these food products in an emergency situation, such as a famine,would certainly help to provide immediate relief from starvation, but only on atemporary basis until real foods become available. However, the WFP also claimsthat these ‘food products’ assist in providing education about nutrition andnutritious foods, but this is disingenuous; a more accurate description of theseproducts would include reference to them as ‘energy-dense’ but‘nutritionally-poor’, which means that they are precisely the types of ‘foods’that contribute to malnutrition. This highlights the misleading nature ofinformation provided by the WFP, which like the WHO, is a contributor to areport critical of ‘processed food products’, yet simultaneously promotesprocessed food products as ‘nutritious foods’.One of the reasons that hunger is said to persist, especially in ‘developing’countries, is claimed to be due to food scarcity that is caused by the inabilityof food production to keep pace with the increasing size of the worldpopulation; but this is a false claim. The world does not suffer from a scarcityof food; this point is succinctly explained by authors Frances Moore Lappé andJoseph Collins, who state in their 1977 book entitled Food First: Beyond theMyth of Scarcity that,> “While hunger is real, scarcity is an illusion.”Two years prior to the publication of their book, the authors founded theInstitute for Food and Development Policy, which is also known as Food First.The current information provided on the Food First website shows that little haschanged in the intervening decades. The web page entitled The Myth: Scarcity.The Reality: There IS enough food states that,> “Abundance, not scarcity, best describes the supply of food in the world> today.”The reasons that hunger persists in a world of abundant food production arediscussed in the next section.Agriculture & Food SecurityThe UN anticipates that the world population will continue to grow into theforeseeable future, as indicated by a June 2017 web page entitled Worldpopulation projected to reach 9.8 billion in 2050, and 11.2 billion in 2100; thetitle is self-explanatory.One of the concerns that arise from projections of this nature relates to ‘foodsecurity’, which essentially refers to the ability to ensure that an adequatesupply of food is available for everyone all year round. Concerns about foodsecurity had been raised by Agenda 21, specifically in Chapter 14, in which itwas claimed that the capacity of existing resources to provide sufficient foodwas ‘uncertain’ and that efforts were therefore needed to,> “…increase food production in a sustainable way and enhance food security.”These concerns and issues remain key features of UN policy recommendations andhave been incorporated into SDG 2 of the 2030 Agenda, as indicated in theprevious section, especially in target 4 of SDG 2 that aims to,> “By 2030, ensure sustainable food production systems and implement resilient> agricultural practices that increase productivity and production…”This target is clearly an attempt to address the problem of ‘world hunger’. Asdiscussed in the previous section, millions of people around the world live in astate of ‘hunger’; but they do so despite the fact that food production levelsare more than adequate to feed everyone. This fact is confirmed by a WFP webpage entitled 11 Myths About Global Hunger that states,> “There is enough food in the world today for everyone to have the nourishment> necessary for a healthy and productive life.”There are a number of reasons that ‘world hunger’ persists despite an amplesupply of food, one of which is because ‘hungry’ people are almost invariablythose who are also trapped in a state of ‘extreme poverty’; a situation that isexacerbated by static incomes that are unable to absorb rising food prices. Butthese circumstances are not exclusive to people who live in ‘developing’countries, they are also a common feature of life for increasing numbers ofpeople in ‘developed’ countries.Two other reasons for the persistence of hunger are suggested by the previouslycited Food Security report, which refers to conflicts and ‘climate change’ asthe main drivers of worsening world hunger and claims that,> “The food security situation has worsened in particular in parts of> sub-Saharan Africa, South-Eastern Asia and Western Asia…”The term ‘Western Asia’ refers to the region of the world more commonly known asthe Middle East, a region that, in the past few decades, has experiencednumerous conflicts, all of which would certainly have had adverse effects notonly on the production of food but also its distribution. In thesecircumstances, the ‘food security’ situation can only be improved by theresolution of the conflicts and the restoration of peace, rather than theimplementation of ‘resilient’ and ‘sustainable’ agricultural practices.During the many thousands of years of human existence, farmers in all regions ofthe world have domesticated animals and cultivated plants for the expresspurpose of producing food. Over the course of time, they also developedtechniques to improve the quality and quantity of the food crops they couldproduce and the health of the animals they reared. In respect of plant crops,these techniques included crop rotation, soil fertility maintenance, seedcollection, seed variety creation, crop resilience, pest control and irrigationsystems, amongst others. Farmers have also had to learn to contend with thevicissitudes of nature and a variety of weather conditions. In the distant past,farms were generally small-scale enterprises; in remote areas, they oftencomprised a tiny plot of land on which a family would eke out a meagre livingfrom the few foods they were able to grow. Although far less common, subsistencefarming of this nature still exists in some regions of the world.The nature of farming changed dramatically after the development of largeplantations, each of which was, and many still are, devoted to the cultivationof a single export crop. These plantations proliferated almost exclusively incolonised countries, in which many colonisers became plantation owners, who,according to the authors of the previously cited book entitled Food First,> “…expropriated the best land for continuous cultivation of crops for export.”These large single-crop plantations, or monocultures, caused many problems forthe indigenous peoples, one of which was that their forced removal from fertileland onto marginal, and invariably less fertile land, reduced both the quantityand the quality of the food they were able to produce. Furthermore, although theexport of plantation crops provided a good source of income, the benefits ofthat prosperity were only enjoyed by plantation owners. The indigenouspopulation would invariably endure harsh living conditions; a situation thatpersisted into the 20th century, as discussed by Eduardo Galeano in Open Veinsof Latin America, in which he states that,> “Subordinated to foreign needs and often financed from abroad, the colonial> plantation evolved directly into the present-day latifundio, one of the> bottlenecks that choke economic development and condemn the masses to poverty> and a marginal existence in Latin America today.”This situation continues into the 21st century, but it is not unique to LatinAmerica; as the authors state in Food First,> “To the colonizers of Africa, Asia and Latin America, agriculture became a> means to extract wealth...”The primary purpose of agriculture is to produce food, not wealth; it shouldtherefore be a requirement of agricultural production systems to prioritisedomestic consumption needs, and only after these needs have been met shouldsurpluses be made available for export. This idea is, however, anathema toorganisations, such as the World Bank and IMF, that regard the ability of anation to earn income from exports as more important than its ability to providesufficient food for the population. Nevertheless, the cultivation of cash crops,such as coffee, tea, tobacco and sugar for example, all of which are grownalmost exclusively for export purposes, remains a key feature of ‘agriculture’in many ‘developing’ countries within Latin America, Asia and Africa.Although large monoculture farms first appeared long before the 20th century,they have proliferated since the introduction in the 1960s of the ‘GreenRevolution’, which required the use of large quantities of chemicals on thebasis that they would improve agricultural outputs. One of the main effects oflarge monoculture farms is the depletion of soil fertility, a problem thattraditional small-scale farmers had generally avoided through techniques such ascrop rotation and mixed crop planting. The ‘Green Revolution’ solution to theproblem inevitably entailed the use of synthetic chemical fertilisers, the firsttype of which was developed from nitrate compounds that had been produced by thewar industry, but had become surplus to requirements at the end of WWII.Other types of chemical fertiliser contain potassium and phosphorus in additionto nitrates. These are commonly referred to as NPK fertilisers in reference tothe chemical symbols for each element; N for nitrogen; P for phosphorus and Kfor potassium. Although these chemicals are required for soil fertility, theyare not the only nutrients necessary for a healthy and fertile soil. Theapplication of N, P and K alone, therefore causes an imbalance in the naturalchemical constitution of the soil and consequently affects the nutritionalquality of the food crops grown in that soil.Furthermore, a healthy soil requires more than just chemicals, even if they arein the correct balance; it also requires an abundance of healthy soil organisms,the functions of which include the decomposition of dead organic matter in orderto return the released nutrients back into the soil. The synthetic chemicalproducts utilised by ‘Green Revolution’ methods do not nourish the soil or itscommunity of soil organisms. Most, if not all of the chemical products used aretoxic; which means that they are poisonous to the soil organisms essential for ahealthy, fertile soil.Although Latin America was the first region into which the ‘Green Revolution’was introduced, India was the first country in Asia to ‘benefit’ from this newagricultural system. Indian farmers were led to believe that the ‘GreenRevolution’ would lead to greater prosperity; they would not only reduce theircosts, as less fertiliser would be needed, but they would also increase theirincome, because of the greater crop yields they would achieve. Unfortunately forthe farmers, the reality, as they soon discovered, was the complete opposite;the Food First ‘primer’ document entitled Green Revolution explains,> “In Punjab, India, an early Green Revolution showcase, farmers now apply three> times the amount of fertilizers to maintain the same yields.”The farmers who adopted the ‘Green Revolution’ have discovered that thischemical-based system does not increase crop yields, but does require increasedquantities of fertiliser and pesticides; the reason that this system failed issuccinctly explained by Vandana Shiva PhD, who states in her July 2017 articleentitled The Farmers’ Crisis that,> “The Green revolution works against the Earth. It is based on war chemicals,> and manifests as a war against the earth…”Another serious consequence of this system of agriculture has been that farmersare required to purchase ‘Green Revolution’ seeds, as the primer states,> “By the 1990s around 40 percent of all farmers in the Third World were using> Green Revolution seeds.”Prior to the implementation of ‘Green Revolution’ agriculture, farmerstraditionally collected their own seeds, not only for the purposes of plantingthe next crop, but also for the purposes of developing new varieties andimproving seed properties, such as resilience to damage from drought and floodas well as from pests. The requirement for farmers to purchase rather thancollect their own seeds has had profound consequences, two of which, accordingto the primer, are that,> “The world lost an estimated 75 percent of its agro-biodiversity, and control> over seeds shifted from farmers to a handful of corporations, such as> Monsanto, DuPont and Syngenta.”The most insidious aspect of the ‘Green Revolution’, also referred to as‘Industrial Agriculture’, is that it has enabled large agribusinesscorporations, whose priority is profit not food production, to gain aninordinate level of influence and control over a significant proportion of theworld’s food supply. Their dominance over agricultural production methods andinputs also enables these huge conglomerates to exert influence over the natureand content of policy recommendations issued by international organisations,including those within the UN system. The reason that they can exert this levelof influence is mainly due to cooperation at the highest levels betweencorporate owners, bankers, financiers, politicians and others; as will bediscussed in chapter nine.Financial aid provided by the IMF and World Bank is, as discussed, alwayssubject to conditions that include policies that must be agreed to andimplemented by the recipient country often prior to obtaining the funds. Thesepolicies invariably include the imposition of drastic measures that are claimedto be able to improve a country’s economic situation and ‘income’, or GNI ascalculated by the World Bank. In her April 2013 article entitled The Seeds ofSuicide: How Monsanto Destroys Farming, Vandana Shiva discusses the influence ofagribusiness corporations over international organisations and explains that,> “The entry of Monsanto in the Indian seed sector was made possible with a 1988> Seed Policy imposed by the World Bank requiring the Government of India to> deregulate the seed sector.”The effects of corporate control over seeds can be devastating, as she explains,> “Control over seed is the first link in the food chain, because seed is the> source of life. When a corporation controls seed, it controls life, especially> the life of farmers.”Agribusiness corporations have gained even greater control through geneticengineering techniques that are claimed to create entirely new types of seed.These techniques have enabled the biotech industry to claim ownership of theseseeds on the basis that they are new ‘creations’ for which they have beengranted patents. The consequences of the virtual control of seeds through theissue of patents to biotech corporations are discussed by Vandana Shiva, whostates in her article that,> “Through patents on seed, Monsanto has become the ‘Life Lord’ of our planet,> collecting rents for life’s renewal from farmers, the original breeders.”The conditions attached to financial assistance provided by the IMF and WorldBank often include the requirement for farmers to grow ‘cash crops’ for exportpurposes, in order to boost the country’s economy. But farmers rarely benefitfrom any boost to the economy because their incomes are subject to the vagariesof the ‘markets’ for their produce. Market forces generally mean that thefarmers who sell their crops after the harvest in order to earn their incomewill all do so at the same time, which produces a market glut that forces pricesdown and reduces the income that farmers can earn. Vandana Shiva states in herpreviously cited Farmers Crisis article, that,> “Farmers are growing monocultures and are dependent on a single buyer – the> government or a corporation – to buy what they grow, as a commodity for> trading posts.”Alternatively, crops may be stored after the harvest for the purposes of ‘foodsecurity’ and to provide against a possible future harvest failure; however,stocks of this nature can also provide opportunities for market traders tomanipulate prices in ways that are beneficial to them, but are almost invariablydetrimental to the farmers.Another difficulty for farmers is that this type of agriculture requires a largecapital outlay for the purchase of seeds, fertilisers and other necessities, butthis is often beyond their means. To meet these costs, farmers are encouraged toaccept credit terms, usually in the form of a loan, which increases their costs.But the agricultural system the farmers have been enticed to adopt does notfulfil the promises of increased prosperity; in virtually all instances, thissystem leaves farmers in a far worse financial situation and traps them in acycle of indebtedness from which they are unable to escape. This ‘debt trap’ hashelped to push farmers in all parts of the world into poverty; in India, it hasalso pushed large numbers of farmers into such a state of desperate helplessnessthat many have committed suicide; Vandana Shiva explains,> “Debt for purchase of costly non renewable seeds and unnecessary toxic inputs> is the primary reason for farmers suicides and farmers protests.”In her article, she reports that the number of farmers who had committed suicidehad exceeded 300,000 and that,> “The suicides are concentrated in regions where the Green Revolution has> invaded agriculture – destroying diversity, destroying indigenous agriculture,> destroying farmers self reliance, destroying soil and water.”She adds the further comment that,> “Suicides are taking place where globalisation policies have destroyed the> diversity of crops and diversity of markets.”As previously discussed, globalisation has encouraged food prices to be broughtup to their global market levels; a situation that is devastating for people in‘developing’ countries in two ways. The first is that people who live in povertywith a static income are unable to absorb increases in the price of any of theirbasic needs, especially food. The second is that farmers do not gain the benefitfrom increases in the prices paid by consumers. Vandana Shiva explains thissecond point in her article and states that,> “Food prices are rising in the Third World, as food subsidies are removed, and> the polarisation, between prices farmers receive and prices consumers pay,> increases.”This situation continues to persist, despite the claim that the UN is committedto addressing the issue of hunger by helping small farmers, as indicated by SDG2.3 that states the aim to,> “By 2030, double the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food> producers…”The expansion of globalisation and industrial agriculture means that hugeagribusiness conglomerates will not readily relinquish their control over foodproduction as it is far too lucrative for them. No matter how impressive thegoals of the 2030 Agenda may sound, or how committed the UN Member States are torealising these goals, it is the actions they take that will determine whetherthe goals can be achieved, or not. The evidence strongly indicates that theactions that have been taken are woefully inadequate; as ‘IndustrialAgriculture’ continues to expand for the benefit of corporations, but to thedetriment of small-scale farmers.One of the main reasons that ‘Industrial Agriculture’ persists is because it isclaimed to be necessary to solve the problem of ‘world hunger’; but this claimis refuted by the Food First web page entitled World Hunger: Ten Myths, whichrefers to increased corporate control and states that,> “The industrial model also ends up accelerating the concentration of control> over land and other resources.”The Food First ‘primer’ document entitled Land and Resources, discusses theimportance of land in the context of food production and states that,> “A global wave of land and water grabs is concentrating farmland and other> food producing resources in the hands of a few, with serious consequences for> both rural and urban communities...”Land grabs are not a recent phenomenon; they have been a feature of colonialismand other systems of control for many centuries. The justification for grabbingland in colony countries was based on the concept of Terra Nullius, which meansthat the lands were perceived as empty and thus available for use andexploitation by those who merely ‘claimed’ it. The belief held by colonisersthat land could be claimed, and therefore ‘owned’, was in complete contrast tothe beliefs of most indigenous peoples; as indicated by Vandana Shiva in herNovember 2015 article entitled Corporate Imperialism – The only reason for GMOs,in which she states that,> “Cultures around the world saw people as belonging to the land, not the land> belonging to ‘one’.”Land grabs have also been instigated to take advantage of tragic events, such asthe Bangladesh famine for example, as explained by the authors in Food First,> “During the 1974 famine, rich landholders stood in line all night at land> registry offices in order to buy land that hungry, mortgaged small farmers> were selling as a last resort.”As the value of land continues to rise, it becomes impossible for lost farms toever be recovered by their former owners. Increased land values do, however,favour ‘investors’ who purchase land purely for investment purposes; asdiscussed in a November 2010 article entitled The new farm owners: Corporateinvestors lead the rush for control over overseas farmland. The article refersto the 2008 global economic crisis that has resulted in large scale purchases offarmland, particularly in ‘developing’ countries, and states that,> “For the past two years, investors have been scrambling to take control of> farmland in Asia, Africa and Latin America.”One reason claimed to justify ‘land-grabs’ in these regions is that they arenecessary to help solve the world’s food production problems; but investors arenot farmers. Whilst farmers will utilise land for the production of food, whichwill help people who are hungry, investors will simply hold land merely as an‘investment’, often leaving it entirely unused. The ‘scramble’ for farmland bycorporate investors is in direct contradiction to the aim of SDG 2.3; yet UNMember States have failed to implement policies to rectify this situation, eventhough the problem of ‘world hunger’ is recognised to have worsened.On the website of the FAO, another UN ‘specialised agency’, is an articleentitled Trends and impacts of foreign investment in developing countryagriculture – Evidence from case studies that refers to a 2012 FAO report withthe same title and states that,> “Investors today are keen to capitalize on current high international food> prices, and actually seek investment opportunities in developing countries,> notably where natural resources abound.”The article refers to some case studies discussed in the report that involvedlarge-scale land acquisitions, about which the article states that the reportfound,> “…some evidence of negative impacts on the stock of natural resources> including land, water, forests and biodiversity.”These large-scale agricultural schemes are clearly detrimental to theenvironment. The Food First land ‘primer’ document highlights a main part of theproblem, which is that,> “Global institutional investors view agricultural land as an $8.4 trillion> market...”The contemplation of land, especially agricultural land, as a source ofinvestment rather than food production, is also in direct contradiction toconcerns about ‘food security’ and the need to increase food production. Yetthese concerns about ‘food security’ are raised by exactly the sameinternational organisations within the UN system that support the implementationof structural adjustment programmes that require ‘cash crops’ to be grown forexport, instead of food crops for domestic consumption. In The Globalization ofPoverty, Professor Chossudovsky provides examples of countries, especially inAfrica, that have been affected by the onerous policies of the IMF and WorldBank. One of the examples he refers to is Rwanda, about which he states,> “It was the restructuring of the agricultural system under IMF-World Bank> supervision which precipitated the population into abject poverty and> destitution.”The main plantation ‘cash crop’ in Rwanda was coffee, but when coffee pricesplummeted in the 1980s, the country’s economy entered a period of severe crisisthat was exacerbated by famine. The assistance provided to Rwanda by the IMFwas, as usual in these cases, subject to certain conditions; ProfessorChossudovsky explains,> “The IMF had demanded the ‘opening up’ of the domestic market to the dumping> of US and European grain surpluses.”The demands to ‘open’ up domestic markets and to receive ‘dumped’ surpluses arealso common features of the conditions imposed by the IMF and World Bank; asituation that demonstrates their preference for providing support to largecorporate enterprises, rather than local food producers who are unable tocompete with such cheap imports. But there is a further detrimental aspect tothese ‘dumped’ surpluses, one that is largely hidden but is explained byProfessor Chossudovsky who, with reference to the US, states that,> “...they have been peddling the adoption of their own genetically modified> seeds under the disguise of emergency aid and famine relief.”Another example he refers to is Ethiopia, a country that has suffered manyfamines over the past few decades, for which it has received emergency aid andfamine relief, as Professor Chossudovsky explains,> “Some 500,000 tons of maize and maize products were ‘donated’ in 1999-2000 by> USAID to relief agencies including the World Food Programme (WFP) which, in> turn, collaborates closely with the US Department of Agriculture.”He also reports that almost a third of the foods included in this humanitarian‘aid’ were genetically modified. It is clear therefore, that the organisationswithin the UN system are fully supportive of GM foods; this is furtherdemonstrated by Vandana Shiva in her previously cited Corporate Imperialismarticle, in which she states,> “It is through the WTO that legal structures of entire countries were> undermined and GMOs forced upon them.”The WTO is one of the ‘related organisations’ within the UN system, which, asits name implies, is concerned with world trade. The main function of the WTO,according to the website, is,> “…to ensure that trade flows smoothly, predictably and freely as possible.”The WTO is therefore another organisation that prioritises the needs of trade inpreference to the needs of people. The policies of the WTO that force countriesto accept GM foods are usually claimed to be justified on the grounds ofensuring ‘food security’, and the ability to feed the ever-growing worldpopulation. The previously cited GMO Myths and Truths report describes thisargument as a ‘myth’ and states the ‘truth’ to be that,> “GM crops are irrelevant to feeding the world.”In support of this argument, the GMO Myths report refers to a 1998 statement tothe FAO by 24 delegates from 18 African countries, in which they refer to GMtechnology as,> “...neither safe, environmentally friendly nor economically beneficial to us.”These delegates were clearly aware at an early date that there were manyproblems associated with GM; they added in their statement that they did notbelieve that GM technologies,> “…will help our farmers to produce the food that is needed in the 21st> century. On the contrary, we think it will destroy the diversity, the local> knowledge and the sustainable agricultural systems that our farmers have> developed for millennia, and that it will thus undermine our capacity to feed> ourselves.”This is a powerful statement; it is also significant that it was made by peoplefrom African countries, because they are increasingly the targets of efforts byagribusiness corporations keen to introduce GM crops into Africa, on the basisof the claim that they will ‘solve’ the problem of hunger within that vastcontinent. This claim has been proven to be false, as recognised by the Africandelegates in their statement to the FAO. The continuing pressure on Africancountries is discussed in a November 2014 article entitled GMOs in Africa:Capturing frontier markets in the name of food security, which states that,> “African nations clearly represent the new frontier market for biotech firms.”The efforts of the agribusiness industry to enter the African agriculturalmarket are conducted largely under the auspices of AGRA (Alliance for a GreenRevolution in Africa). On a web page entitled Developing Africa’s Seed Systemsis the claim that the performance of African food staples is not as good asthose of the rest of the world, and that African crop harvests are substantiallybelow their potential. The AGRA ‘solution’ to this problem was to create PASS(Program for Africa’s Seed Systems), on the basis of,> “The desire to give African farmers a wider range of seed choices – including> access to seeds of highly productive crop varieties known as hybrids…”Although AGRA describes these seeds as ‘hybrids’, this is disingenuous, as theyare far more likely to be GM varieties, which have not been proven to be ‘highlyproductive’. The real purpose of programmes such as PASS is for agribusinesscorporations to not only boost sales of their products and amass even greaterprofits for their owners, but to also gain even greater control over the world’sfood supply.The urgency of the desire to increase food production to feed the expandingworld population suggests that current production levels are barely able to meetexisting needs; however, this is a mistaken idea and needs to be put into thecorrect perspective. According to the FAO web page entitled Food Wastage: keyfacts and figures, in 2011, the estimated global food wastage was in excess of 1billion tonnes, which is said to represent more than a quarter of the totalamount of food produced globally. The fact that such an immense volume of foodwastage occurs in a world where millions live in hunger highlights the existenceof severe inequities and inequalities with respect to the distribution of food.It also demonstrates the appalling nature of policies that demand ‘cash crops’to be grown for export in preference to food crops grown for domesticconsumption. Yet these policies are created by the same organisations that claimto be committed to providing ‘food security’ by implementing ‘sustainable’agriculture methods that are able to increase food production levels.The FAO web page entitled Key facts on food loss and waste you should know!provides a revealing comparison,> “Every year, consumers in rich countries waste almost as much food (222> million tonnes) as the entire net food production of sub-Saharan Africa (230> million tonnes).”The problem of food wastage has been recognised by the UN and is incorporatedinto SDG 12.3 that states the aim to,> “By 2030, halve the per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer> levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including> post-harvest losses.”It is abundantly clear from the discussion in this section that there are manyproblems with ‘Industrial Agriculture’; a system that relies on toxic chemicals,huge monoculture farms, genetic engineering, patents and corporate ownership ofall agricultural resources. These problems are discussed by Colin Todhunter inhis November 2015 article entitled The tremendous success of Agroecology inAfrica, in which he states that,> “It is essential that we get off the chemical treadmill that the modern> industrial urban-centric food and agricultural system is based on.”As indicated by the title of his article, there are solutions to these problems,but they require an entirely different approach to agriculture; one that placesthe production of nutritious food as its prime concern. These solutions involveagricultural systems that have been proven to be successful; they include, butare not restricted to, organic systems and agroecology. The Failure to Yieldreport, previously cited in chapter six, refers to the need to increase foodproduction in ‘developing’ countries and, with reference to organic systems,states that,> “Several recent studies have shown that low-external-input methods such as> organic can improve yield by over 100 percent in these countries, along with> other benefits.”The GMO Myths and Truths report also refers to organic systems and states that,> “A 2008 United Nations report looked at 114 farming projects in 24 African> countries and found that organic or near-organic practices resulted in yield> increases averaging over 100%.”These successes from organic agricultural methods alone provide a clearrefutation of the AGRA claim that Africa needs access to ‘hybrid’ seeds to boosttheir harvests.Agroecology is defined in the Food First ‘primer’ document entitled Agroecologyas the ‘science of sustainable agriculture’, which suggests that it ought to berecognised and embraced by the UN in its efforts to implement ‘sustainable’ foodproduction. However, this is unlikely to be the case, because agroecology doesnot utilise the methods favoured by corporate agriculture, as the primer states,> “In sharp contrast to the proposal to industrialize all of the world’s> production systems with GMOs and monocultures, Agroecology demands> diversification, small and medium land holdings and an emphasis on farming as> a livelihood.”Furthermore, the primer also explains that,> “Instead of a steady concentration of wealth and monopoly power, agroecology> works to decentralize and equitably distribute the power and wealth in our> food systems.”Organic agriculture, agroecology and all similarly ecologically-soundagricultural food production systems are eminently preferable to that of‘Industrial Agriculture’. The page entitled Organic Movement on the Navdanyawebsite refers to the reasons that these methods are preferable and should beadopted by all farmers in all regions of the world, in the statement that,> “Our research has proved that contrary to the dominant assumptions, ecological> agriculture is highly productive and is the only lasting solution to hunger> and poverty.”It is only through agricultural systems of this type that genuinely nutritiousfoods can be successfully grown; the importance of nutrient-rich foods cannot beover-emphasised, especially in the context of health.Clean Water & SanitationWater is one of the most vital of all ‘basic human needs’; without it no humanis able to survive for more than a few days. The cellular processes that supportvirtually all of the functions of the human body require the presence of water;which means that water intended for human consumption should be ‘clean’. Butthis is not the term used by the UN and WHO; instead they use the term ‘safe’when referring to water quality.Although included in the discussions in chapter six, the following statementsare repeated for ease of reference in this discussion.The February 2018 WHO fact sheet entitled Drinking-water states that,> “Safe and readily available water is important for public health…”Target 1 of SDG 6 states the aim to,> “By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable> drinking water for all.”Target 2 of SDG 6 states the aim to,> “By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for> all…”These references to ‘safe’ water are, however, misleading. The discussions inchapter six demonstrate that the word ‘safe’, when used with reference to bothwater and food, has become a relative term to mean ‘as safe as possible’ ratherthan absolutely harmless, which is its real meaning. Consequently, the lessstringent criterion of ‘as safe as possible’ permits water intended for humanconsumption to contain contaminants, provided they remain below the level deemedto pose a ‘risk’ to human health. The erroneous nature of the idea that‘poisons’ only become harmful beyond a certain ‘dose’ or exposure level has beendiscussed; but this idea and its consequences for human health are of particularrelevance to the populations of ‘developing’ countries, as this discussion willdemonstrate.The rigid adherence to the ‘germ theory’ perpetuates the idea that certain‘germs’, which are claimed to breed in unhygienic conditions, are the mostsignificant contaminants of water and the main causes of ‘water-borne’illnesses. This erroneous idea is contained within the WHO report entitled WaterQuality and Health Strategy 2013-2020, which will be referred to as the WaterQuality report. Although the report recognises that water ‘of poor quality’ canadversely affect health, the effects are claimed to take the form of ‘infectiousdiseases’; as indicated by the statement that,> “Contaminated water serves as a mechanism to transmit communicable diseases> such as diarrhoea, cholera, dysentery, typhoid and guinea worm infection.”The February 2018 WHO fact sheet entitled Sanitation refers to a similar groupof diseases that are associated with poor sanitation and states that,> “Poor sanitation is linked to transmission of diseases such as cholera,> diarrhoea, dysentery, hepatitis A, typhoid and polio.”Cholera, which is one of the diseases common to both groups, is defined by theestablishment as,> “an acute infection of the small intestine by the bacterium Vibrio cholera,> which causes severe vomiting and diarrhoea...”Cholera is not exclusive to ‘developing’ countries, it can occur anywhere thatclean water and sanitation facilities are inadequate or absent. Conditions ofthis nature are increasingly common within ‘inner city slums’ in ‘developed’countries, and are invariably experienced by people who live in a state ofpoverty. Although recognised to be associated with insanitary conditions,cholera, like other ‘diarrhoeal diseases’, is claimed to result from an‘infection’ that may also induce vomiting. But this claim is misleading,diarrhoea and vomiting are not caused by ‘infections’ nor are they ‘diseases’;they are both natural mechanisms by which the body expels substances itrecognises to be ‘toxic’.The January 2019 WHO fact sheet entitled Cholera claims that cholera can befatal if left untreated, but makes the surprising statement that,> “Most people infected with V. cholerae do not develop any symptoms…”The fact sheet also states that,> “Among people who develop symptoms, the majority have mild or moderate> symptoms, while a minority develop acute watery diarrhoea with severe> dehydration. This can lead to death if left untreated.”Unlike most other diseases claimed to be caused by bacteria, cholera is nottreated with antibiotics; the fact sheet explains the reason in the surprisingstatement that,> “Mass administration of antibiotics is not recommended as it has no proven> effect on the spread of cholera…”The main ‘treatment’ for cholera involves rehydration, as the fact sheet states,> “The majority of people can be treated successfully through prompt> administration of oral rehydration solution (ORS).”Rehydration is clearly of vital importance when the body has undergone asignificant loss of fluid due to severe bouts of vomiting and diarrhoea, but theclaim that rehydration is sufficient treatment for a disease claimed to bebacterial is inconsistent with the theory that cholera is caused by bacteria. Inaddition, the statement that ‘infection’ with V. cholerae may not produce anysymptoms violates Koch’s first Postulate.Although cholera is said to be ‘easily treatable’, the pharmaceutical industryhas developed an oral cholera vaccine that the WHO recommends for use in areasthat are cholera endemic, most of which are within ‘developing’ countries.Previous discussions have indicated that this vaccine will not be able toprevent cholera, but instead, like all other vaccines, will exacerbate existingill-health problems.The unhealthy living conditions in which cholera often occurs are the result ofvarious factors; these include wars and conflicts that destroy not only basicinfrastructure, but also peoples’ homes from which they are forced to flee inorder to save their lives. Unfortunately, this ‘flight to safety’ may forcepeople to endure temporary living accommodation in camps that invariably lackmost, if not all, basic facilities, especially clean water and sanitation. Thecholera fact sheet recognises that temporary camps set up for refugees anddisplaced persons generate ‘risks’ for disease and states that,> “The consequences of a humanitarian crisis – such as disruption of water and> sanitation systems, or the displacement of populations to inadequate and> overcrowded camps – can increase the risk of cholera transmission, should the> bacteria be present or introduced.”Although it may seem that diseases spread between people through thetransmission of ‘germs’, this is a deceptive appearance, as has been discussed.It does not require the presence of bacteria, or any other so-called ‘germ’, forsevere ill-health to exist amongst large numbers of people who aresimultaneously deprived of access to clean water and basic sanitationfacilities. The ingestion of water contaminated with human wastes, rotting foodand other refuse is more than sufficient to cause ‘outbreaks’ of vomiting anddiarrhoea. The lack of access to clean drinking water for rehydration willexacerbate the situation; persistent dehydration will worsen existing illnessand can even lead to death.Human wastes are clearly a major source of water contamination; the UN web pageentitled Progress of Goal 6 in 2016 claims that almost a billion people practiseopen defecation, and that almost two billion people are exposed to water sourcescontaminated by faecal matter. Although the page indicates that the proportionof the world population with access to sanitation facilities continues toincrease, it states that,> “Nevertheless, the unsafe management of faecal waste and wastewater continues> to present a major risk to public health and the environment.”Faeces are waste materials produced by the human body; if ingested, they willinvariably cause an immediate attack of vomiting. It should be clear, therefore,that it is not due to the presence of ‘germs’ that water contaminated with humanfaecal wastes will induce vomiting, diarrhoea or both. As discussed in chaptersix, faecal matter is not eliminated from water through treatments that utilisedisinfectants for the specific purpose of killing ‘germs’. The chemicals used as‘disinfectants’, which are mainly chlorine-based compounds, do not purify water.On the contrary, these chemicals pose an additional and significant hazard notonly to human health but also to the environment. The problems of ‘unsafe water’are clearly not due to ‘unsafe management’; they are largely the result of theerroneous belief that ‘germs’ are a major source of water contamination andtherefore need to be killed.Unfortunately, water disinfection processes in ‘developing’ countries utilisethe same types of chemicals as those used in ‘developed’ countries; as indicatedby the previously cited Water Guidelines report, that states,> “Disinfection of household drinking-water in developing countries is done> primarily with free chlorine...”The hazards to human health from the use of chlorine-based compounds to‘disinfect’ water to make it ‘safe’ for human consumption have been discussed.Water can be contaminated from numerous other sources, a significant proportionof which are attributable to industrial activities, such as mining, oil and gasextraction, chemical manufacturing, textile manufacturing and agriculture, toname just a few. Most of these industries produce toxic wastes, some of whichmay be discharged as effluent into bodies of fresh water, such as rivers, thatmay be used in some areas by the local population as their main source of water,especially for drinking. Liquid wastes discharged by industrial facilities donot just affect surface waters, they can also seep into the soil and, if theypermeate deeply into the ground, these toxic substances can eventually reach andthereby poison groundwater, another vital source of fresh water that frequentlyserves a wider area in addition to local communities.The contamination of water due to industrial activities has been recognised,albeit to a limited extent, by the 2030 Agenda; as indicated by SDG 6.3 thatstates the aim to,> “By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and> minimising release of hazardous chemicals and materials…”Unfortunately, merely minimising the release of hazardous chemicals andmaterials is a woefully inadequate method to improve water quality; at best,this method only permits water to be described as ‘less polluted’ as it allowsthe continuing discharge of hazardous materials, even if at a reduced level. Itshould be clear that ‘less polluted’ is not synonymous with ‘safe’ and certainlynot with clean. Furthermore, in addition to the fact that few chemicals havebeen tested for their safety or the full extent of their effects, is the factthat no tests have been conducted to determine the effects of exposures to thecountless combinations of the 100,000 or more chemical compounds that have beenproduced and released onto the market and into the environment.The industrial pollution of water is of particular concern for the ‘developing’countries chosen by industries of ‘developed’ countries for relocation of theirmanufacturing facilities. These relocations frequently occur with the specificintention of taking advantage of low costs, especially wages, and lessrestrictive or even totally absent regulatory systems. The absence of measuresthat would otherwise protect the integrity of fresh water sources enablesindustries to discharge toxic substances into local bodies of water, almost withimpunity; an extremely hazardous situation that contributes to worseningmorbidity and mortality in regions that already suffer disproportionately fromsevere health problems.There are numerous industrial chemicals that contaminate water and are presentin differing concentrations; a situation with which scientists would seem to befamiliar, as indicated by the Water Guidelines report that states,> “In most countries, whether developing or industrialized, water sector> professionals are likely to be aware of chemicals that are present in> significant concentrations in some drinking-water supplies.”The concentration in which a toxic chemical is present in water does not affectits inherent toxicity; a poison is a poison whatever its concentration. Theconcentration does however, determine the severity of the effects the substanceis able to cause.One of the major chemicals of concern referred to in the report is arsenic,which is found in the groundwater of a number of regions of the world,especially, but not solely in ‘developing’ countries; as indicated by the WaterQuality report, which states that,> “Inorganic arsenic is present at high levels in the groundwater of a number of> countries, including Argentina, Chile, China, India (West Bengal), Mexico, the> United States of America, and particularly Bangladesh…”Although arsenic is ‘naturally-occurring’, it is also used by many industrialprocesses; which means that it may be present in discharged wastes. It isinteresting to note the symptoms associated with acute arsenic poisoning, whichare described by the February 2018 WHO fact sheet entitled Arsenic that states,> “The immediate symptoms of acute arsenic poisoning include vomiting, abdominal> pain and diarrhoea.”Arsenic is only one of many thousands of toxic substances capable of adverselyaffecting human health; although highly toxic, it is not the most dangeroussubstance; many of the compounds created by the chemical industry, the family ofdioxins for example, are just as hazardous, if not more so.Another major source of water contamination is ‘Industrial Agriculture’, which,as discussed in the previous section, utilises a variety of chemical-basedproducts, especially pesticides, which are intentionally toxic. One of theproblems that result from the use of toxic compounds for agricultural purposesis chemical ‘run-off’; which means that unabsorbed excesses seep into the groundand poison, not only the soil in which plant crops are grown, but also the soilorganisms essential for the maintenance of soil fertility and for good cropyields, in terms of both quantity and quality. These toxic chemicals are able toseep into and poison groundwater, which is a matter of great importance forfarmers in many ‘developing’ countries, where water is a scarce resource; thisis an extremely compelling reason for farmers to avoid ‘Industrial Agriculture’.Although some pesticides are used to protect crops from ‘pests’, others are usedto eliminate insect pests, such as mosquitoes, that are claimed to be thecarriers of parasites, said to be the causes of diseases such as malaria. These‘carriers’, or ‘vectors’, often live and breed in or near water, which is wherepesticides are most frequently applied. Pesticides are, however, toxic to allliving organisms.People who obtain water for drinking, as well as other purposes, from freshwater sources where pesticides have been applied, will also be poisoned,although the nature and extent of the effects they experience will varyaccording to the nature of the chemicals used in the pesticide. As discussed,the mechanisms of action of different chemicals vary; which means that thesymptoms they induce will also vary. However, it is likely that, in ‘developing’countries, symptoms caused by exposures to pesticides will be attributed to a‘water-borne disease’ caused by a ‘pathogen’ of some description; whether abacterium, virus, fungus or parasite. Interestingly, the drinking-water factsheet states that ‘vectors’ breed in clean rather than dirty water.The drinking-water fact sheet recognises that industrial activities andagriculture both contribute to water contamination, but claims that ‘poormanagement’ is largely to blame; as indicated by the previously cited statementthat deserves repetition,> “Inadequate management of urban, industrial, and agricultural wastewater means> the drinking-water of hundreds of millions of people is dangerously> contaminated or chemically polluted.”This clearly applies to ‘developed’ as well as ‘developing’ countries.Unfortunately, however, good management practices, according to the WHO, includethe use of disinfectants to kill ‘germs’; which means that they contribute tothe contamination of water, not to its purification.The Water Guidelines report is an extensive document of more than 600 pages; onechapter, entitled Chemical Aspects provides ‘guideline values’ for a widevariety of chemicals, but these values are based on the Paracelsus fallacy thata ‘safe’ exposure level to a toxic substance can be ascertained. However, someof the chemicals referred to in the report have not been assessed, because,according to the report, the chemical,> “Occurs in drinking-water at concentrations below those of health concern.”Alarmingly, this phrase is used for some of the most highly toxic substances,including pesticides that have been banned in certain countries due to theirextreme toxicity. It should be noted that a number of these pesticides haveremained in use in some ‘developing’ countries; the continuing use of DDT inIndia, for example, as well as its re-introduction into some African countries,have been discussed.The pharmaceutical industry is another major source of water pollution; this isalso a matter of particular concern for ‘developing’ countries, especially thosethat have established, or have been encouraged to establish, their ownpharmaceutical manufacturing facilities. The discharge of pharmaceutical wasteeffluent into local bodies of water has been shown to produce a significantlevel of contamination; a situation of serious concern for drought-prone regionswhere water is a scarce resource and access to fresh water is therefore crucialfor survival. The problem of water contamination in ‘developing’ countries dueto the discharge of pharmaceutical industry wastes is discussed in a 2013article entitled Global risk of pharmaceutical contamination from highlypopulated developing countries that refers to Bangladesh, China, India andPakistan where,> “...most of their industrial units discharge wastewater into domestic sewage> network without any treatment.”The article raises the genuine concern that pharmaceutical contamination ofwater poses serious risks to health. These health hazards are due to themanufacturing processes and the chemical composition of the wastes discharged;as demonstrated by a 2007 article entitled Effluent from drug manufacturerscontain extremely high levels of pharmaceuticals that reports on the analysisof,> “...pharmaceuticals in the effluent from a wastewater treatment plant serving> about 90 bulk drug manufacturers in Patancheru, near Hyderabad, India – a> major production site of generic drugs for the world market.”The article refers to the results of the analyses, which showed that,> “The samples contained by far the highest levels of pharmaceuticals in any> effluent.”The Blacksmith Institute report entitled Pharmaceutical Waste Analysis,previously cited in chapter one, has identified a number of highly toxicchemicals that are used in pharmaceuticals,> “Priority pollutants, including methylene chloride, toluene, chloroform,> 1,2-dichloroethane and phenol were identified as being used in the> manufacturing of extractive pharmaceuticals.”Although these are clearly highly toxic compounds, the WHO minimises the healthhazards posed by the chemicals used in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, in asection of the Water Guidelines report entitled Pharmaceuticals in DrinkingWater, which states that,> “Concerns over pharmaceuticals should not divert the attention and valuable> resources of water suppliers and regulators from the various bacterial, viral> and protozoan waterborne pathogens and other chemical priorities, such as lead> and arsenic.”This is disingenuous; the misplaced concerns are those that relate to so-called‘pathogens’. Concerns about pharmaceuticals are not misplaced; but the harmcaused by ‘medicines’ does not receive the level of attention it should, despitethe existence of the phenomenon of iatrogenesis. However, as ‘developing’countries seek to establish their own pharmaceutical industries on the basis ofthe erroneous idea that chemical compounds are ‘medicines’ that can curedisease, their sources of fresh water will inevitably become increasinglypolluted.Furthermore, the drive to promote the 2030 Agenda goal of ‘medicines andvaccines for all’ will have a significant impact on the quality of fresh waterthroughout the world; not only through the discharge of increased volumes ofindustrial wastes but also through increased human wastes that containmetabolised drug chemicals. The presence in water of pharmaceuticals, theirmetabolites and active ingredients poses serious hazards to human health, asmost existing wastewater treatment plants are unable to remove the vast majorityof these compounds; as indicated by the Water Guidelines report that states,> “...wastewater and drinking-water treatment processes are not designed> specifically to remove pharmaceuticals...”It is widely acknowledged that most water treatment processes are unable toremove a significant proportion of all chemicals, not just pharmaceuticals. Butthe erroneous idea that contaminants do not cause harm if they are present atconcentrations below a certain level, means that most water supplies containcombinations of a wide variety of chemicals, the health impacts of which arevirtually unknown, because untested; a situation that is totally unacceptable.All people in all countries of the world should have access to water that istruly ‘safe’; but this requires attention to be paid to the real causes of‘unsafe’ water. Previous discussions have demonstrated that the implementationof sanitation measures that remove ‘wastes’ of all types played a significantrole in improving the health of the population. Measures that improve thequality of water are also essential; however, these should not involve referenceto the removal of ‘germs’. The quality of water can only be improved when theintegrity of all sources of fresh water are protected from all activities thatpollute it. Measures that merely minimise water pollution are no longeradequate; industrial activities, and all other sources of water pollution, mustbe prohibited entirely from discharging toxic wastes into water.The only ‘safe’ water to drink is water that is truly clean; this topic isdiscussed in more detail in chapter ten."},{"pageContent":"> 9. Vested Interests & The Agenda for Control> “We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas> suggested, largely by men we have never heard of.” Edward Bernays The United Nations (UN) is an intergovernmental organisation empowered byCharter to undertake all actions deemed necessary to fulfil the purposescontained within that Charter, as detailed in Article 1, which, in addition tothe maintenance of peace, refers to,> “…international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic,> social, cultural, or humanitarian character…”In chapter IX of the Charter, entitled International Economic and SocialCooperation, Article 55 expands on these purposes with reference to,> “…the creation of conditions of stability and well-being necessary for> peaceful and friendly relations…”In order to create these conditions of peace, stability and well-being, Article55 states that the UN will promote higher standards of living; solutions tointernational economic, social, health and related problems; and human rightsand fundamental freedoms. The overarching aim of the UN would therefore seem tobe to create a better world with a better standard of living for everyone; anoble aim indeed!By virtue of their membership of the UN, all Member States are committed to theprovisions of the Charter, which means they are obliged to undertake therequired actions to fulfil the stated purposes, as indicated by Article 56 thatstates,> “All Members pledge themselves to take joint and separate action in> cooperation with the Organization for the achievement of the purposes set> forth in Article 55.”Although the United Nations organisation was not created until 1945, the UnitedNations Monetary and Financial Conference was held a year earlier at BrettonWoods in the US. A major outcome of this conference was the creation of twointernational financial institutions; namely, the IMF and the International Bankfor Reconstruction and Development, later renamed the World Bank.Since 1945, many other international organisations have been created thattogether form the ‘UN system’. Each of these organisations has been designatedas the ‘authoritative’ body responsible for matters pertaining to a specificissue. The WHO, founded in 1948, is responsible for matters relating to health;UNDP, founded in 1965, for matters relating to development; and UNEP, founded in1972, for matters relating to the environment, to name three important examples.On the basis that the UN is an intergovernmental organisation and thatgovernments are the elected representatives of ‘the people’, it may be assumedthat the international organisations within the UN system only have the bestinterests of ‘the people’ in mind when they develop policies to implementmeasures intended to maintain peace and solve the issues that confront humanity.It may also be assumed that these international organisations are immune toinfluences that may divert them from their stated goals.Unfortunately, these would be mistaken assumptions.Britain was one of the major ‘world powers’ prior to the 20th century, but, bythe early 1900s, the dominance of the British Empire had begun to diminish, aseventually happens to all empires. Inevitably, there were other countries vyingto take Britain’s place and create the next ‘empire’, and none more so than theUnited States of America, especially after WWI had diminished the power of allof their main rivals. The early decades of the 20th century, which had witnessedthe demise of the Ottoman Empire, the revolution in Russia and the defeat ofGermany, had also seen the increase in American influence; but it was not untilthe 1940s that the US would emerge as the world’s foremost ‘power’.The financial system created at the 1944 Bretton Woods conference elevated theUS dollar to the position of the dominant world currency and the only one to bebacked by gold; all other currencies were to be valued against the US dollar;William Engdahl explains in Gods of Money that,> “The dollar became the world’s reserve currency, required by all trading> nations to conduct trade with one another after 1945.”This was a crucial step in the process of promoting the US to the position ofthe dominant ‘world power’.In his February 1941 essay entitled The American Century published in Lifemagazine, Henry Luce, who was regarded as one of the most influential Americansof that era, had referred to America as ‘the most powerful nation in the world’and asserted that it was the duty of that nation to,> “…exert upon the world the full impact of our influence, for such purposes as> we see fit and by such means as we see fit.”This view of America’s power was not unique to Henry Luce, it was an opinionthat had been held for many decades by a number of influential Americans, whoform part of the group referred to in these discussions as ‘vested interests’.The manner in which America was to exert its influence was not to be through an‘empire’ as such, as it was not to involve the occupation of other countries;however, as William Engdahl explains,> “It was every bit an empire, albeit a less visible one, based on the role of> the United States in international finance with the dollar as the pillar of> the postwar system, backed up by overwhelming military superiority.”That ‘overwhelming military superiority’ was displayed for the whole world towitness when the US dropped two nuclear bombs onto Japan in 1945; anunprecedented course of action that demonstrated the US had not only developedweapons of mass destruction, but was also prepared to unleash them onto their‘enemies’.Based on the belief that it was the ‘duty’ of America to lead the world, the‘vested interests’ behind US policy decisions were to undertake various actionsto create and maintain a dominating influence over all the world’s systems andthe organisations created to manage those systems; as William Engdahl furtherexplains,> “The American domination of the world after 1945 would be accomplished via a> new organization, the United Nations…”He adds that this American domination was also extended to,> “…the new Bretton Woods institutions of the International Monetary Fund and> World Bank…”The domination of these financial institutions by ‘vested interests’ basedmainly, although not exclusively, in the US has been amply documented. In hisJune 2018 article entitled From Global Poverty to Exclusion and Despair:Reversing the Tide of War and Globalization, which will be referred to as theGlobal Poverty article, Professor Michel Chossudovsky states that,> “The Bretton Woods institutions are instruments of Wall Street and the> corporate establishment.”The existence of a group of ‘vested interests’ that sought to gain control overthe world financial system for their own private gain was recorded in the workof historian Carroll Quigley, a highly respected professor at GeorgetownUniversity. His study of the documents and papers of a particular group of‘vested interests’ resulted in his 1966 magnum opus entitled Tragedy and Hope,in which he refers to the ‘far-reaching aim’ of this group, which was,> “…nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private> hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of> the world as a whole.”Professor Quigley was not opposed to the objectives of this group, only to theirmethods; his main criticism was that they operated in secret; as he states,> “This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks> of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements arrived at in frequent> private meetings and conferences.”Although the individual members of the various groups of ‘vested interests’ havechanged over the course of time, the overall objective of controlling the worldeconomy has been retained and continues to be implemented. The financial systemthat operates within most countries of the world is largely under the control ofa group of ‘vested interests’ that formulate their policies at secret meetings,and therefore operate outside of any democratic processes. In another book, theaptly-titled The Anglo-American Establishment, Professor Quigley discusses thecomposition of the group he had studied in detail and expresses some of hisconcerns about them, which include,> “…their tendency to place power and influence into hands chosen by friendship> rather than merit, their oblivion to the consequences of their actions…”These are valid concerns; although they are by no means the only concerns thatshould be raised about the actions of groups, including internationalorganisations like those within the UN system, that claim to have the‘authority’ to generate the policies in respect of the various issues thataffect the lives of everyone, everywhere.All UN organisations hold conferences, whether separately or jointly, to discussexisting problems and to propose measures to resolve them; their proceedings aredocumented in published reports and made available to the public. Although notheld in secret, these meetings are nevertheless influenced by ‘vestedinterests’. One particularly significant conference was the UNCED conferenceheld in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It was at this conference, known as theEarth Summit, that the attendees adopted the first ‘global plan’, known asAgenda 21, the Preamble to which, as previously cited, states that,> “We are confronted with a perpetuation of disparities between and within> nations, a worsening of poverty, hunger, ill-health and illiteracy, and the> continuing deterioration of the ecosystem on which we depend for our> well-being.”The next ‘global plan’ was the Millennium Declaration, which was adopted by UNMember States a few years later at the Millennium Summit held in September 2000;this Declaration states that,> “We believe that the central challenge we face today is to ensure that> globalization becomes a positive force for all the world’s people.”The Millennium Declaration committed all UN Member States to certain objectivescodified into eight goals, known as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs),which were intended to address the problems that predominantly affected‘developing’ countries and countries with ‘economies in transition’. Theseproblems included poverty, hunger, disease, illiteracy and inequalities; inother words, the same problems that had been previously identified by Agenda 21.In addition, MDG 7 referred to ‘environmental sustainability’ and MDG 8 to theneed for a ‘global partnership’ to enable countries to develop. These subjectshad also been incorporated into Agenda 21.On the expiration of the MDGs in 2015, the UN held the United NationsSustainable Development Summit that generated the next ‘global plan’, known asthe 2030 Agenda, the main objective of which is claimed to be to address all ofthe issues that confront humanity in the 21st century through the fullimplementation of all 17 goals and 169 targets within a period of 15 years. Thisobjective is justifiably claimed to be both ambitious and far-reaching,especially as some of the problems, particularly poverty and ill-health, haveexisted to varying degrees throughout human history. Nevertheless, the 2030Agenda document makes the bold statement that,> “If we realize our ambitions across the full extent of the Agenda, the lives> of all will be profoundly improved and our world will be transformed for the> better.”This is clearly an extension of the purposes expressed in the UN Charter.However, despite the determination declared within the 2030 Agenda document,some of the SDG targets will not be attained, no matter how fully the proposedmeasures are implemented or how strictly they are followed. The main reason forthe inevitable failure of these targets is because their proposed solutions arebased on flawed theories. One pertinent example is SDG 3.8 that aims to improvehealth through better access to ‘medicines and vaccines for all’, but, aspreviously discussed, pharmaceutical products are inimical to health, notsupportive of it. Nevertheless, the agenda is to involve all UN Membercountries, as the document states,> “All countries and all stakeholders, acting in collaborative partnerships,> will implement this plan.”These ‘collaborative partnerships’ are to include a wide variety oforganisations and ‘stakeholders’, including ‘the people’; as the document alsostates,> “Our journey will involve Governments as well as Parliaments, the UN system> and other international institutions, local authorities, indigenous peoples,> civil society, business and the private sector, the scientific and academic> community – and all people.”This is effectively the same idea as the ‘global partnerships’ referred to inboth Agenda 21 and MDG 8; it also clearly reveals the insidious encroachment of‘globalisation’ into all aspects of life.The involvement of a wide variety of ‘stakeholders’ in the implementation of the‘global plans’ and the required measures to ostensibly address humanity’sproblems, has required some fundamental changes to be made to the way thatvarious ‘systems’ operate. In the ‘health system’ for example, the necessarychanges are described in a 2009 article entitled The Global Role of the WorldHealth Organisation, which will be referred to as the Global Role article; thearticle states that,> “In the midst of an increasingly globalizing world, however, a new> international health framework is emerging; one that is no longer dominated by> a few organizations, but that consists of numerous global health actors.”The identification of certain ‘global health actors’, as well as their role inand influence over the medical establishment system, are discussed later in thischapter.Many of humanity’s problems are genuinely interrelated; the co-existence ofpoverty and ill-health has been discussed. However, some of these problems areclaimed to be interrelated on the basis of some rather tenuous and, in someinstances, flawed ideas. For example, the Overview of the World Bank DevelopmentReport 1993: Investing in Health, refers to an ‘interplay’ between healthpolicies and development that is based on the idea that,> “Because good health increases the economic productivity of individuals and> the economic growth rate of countries, investing in health is one means of> accelerating development.”The purpose of the report, which closely followed Agenda 21 in both timing andcontent, was to provide advice for the governments of ‘developing’ countriesabout the nature of the health policies they should implement. One of therecommendations included in the World Bank report is that government spendingshould be directed towards,> “…low-cost and highly effective activities such as immunization, programs to> combat micronutrient deficiencies, and control and treatment of infectious> diseases.”As previously discussed, these activities are not effective as they do notimprove human health; their only ‘effectiveness’ is in their ability to servethe purposes of certain ‘vested interests’, especially, but not exclusively,those of the pharmaceutical and vaccine industries.A key feature of globalisation is that it facilitates increased cooperationbetween various ‘stakeholders’. As the 2030 Agenda document indicates, these‘stakeholders’ include the ‘private sector’; in other words, corporations whosemain objective is to generate profits for their shareholders. But pursuing the‘profit-motive’ is rarely compatible with the objective of solving humanity’sproblems; measures that are beneficial for corporate interests are almost alwaysprejudicial to the interests of the general public.Another key feature of ‘globalisation’ is that it requires ‘harmonisation’ ofthe rules, regulations and standards that govern all systems, which is one ofthe reasons that these systems are undergoing changes. The inevitableconsequence, if the ‘agenda’ is fully and successfully implemented, will be afull ‘harmonisation’ of all systems, and their eventual merger into a single‘global’ system controlled by a single central ‘authority’ that can beinfluenced or even controlled by ‘vested interests’.The idea that there are ‘vested interests’ whose aim is to gain control over thesystems that govern virtually all aspects of life may seem highly controversial,but that does not invalidate the idea. It is, however, an idea that is gainingacceptance by an ever-larger number of people, as they become increasingly awarethat the ‘systems’ that control most aspects of their lives do not function inthe manner in which they are reported to function; this is patently obvious fromthe evidence that most problems are worsening, not improving as they are claimedto be.The main reason that these problems are worsening is because, as indicated bythe Edward Bernays’ quote that opens this chapter, the public is ‘governed’largely by people who are entirely unknown to them. These unknown and unelectedpeople, together with people who may be known to the public, comprise the‘vested interests’ that are in control of most of the systems that affect thelives of the entire world population; but these ‘vested interests’ have anentirely different ‘agenda’ from that of solving all of humanity’s problems.Problems can only be resolved if their causes have been fully identified. Forsome of the problems documented in the various agendas, the causes areattributed to factors that do not contribute significantly, if at all, to theproblem; for others, the alleged causes are entirely irrelevant. The mostnotable example of the misattribution of a problem to an irrelevant cause is theidea that certain diseases are caused by ‘germs’.The reasons that the causes of some of the most crucial problems are attributedto the wrong factors owe their origin almost entirely to the influence of‘vested interests’; as the discussions in this chapter will demonstrate.Wealth, Power & InfluenceThe popular saying that ‘money is the root of all evil’ is a modification of abiblical saying that claims it is the love of money that is the ‘evil’.Nevertheless, the idea remains that money, which has been used as a medium ofexchange for goods and services for many centuries, is evil; but this is a falsenotion, because ‘money’ is inanimate and therefore has no inherent attributes.However, what can be subjected to critical assessment and assigned labels suchas ‘evil’, are the methods by which money is acquired and the purposes for whichit is used.In the midst of the many hundreds of millions of people around the world wholive in a perpetual state of abject poverty, is a very small group of extremelywealthy people who are often referred to as the ‘one per cent’, although inreality, this group of the ‘super-rich’ represents a much smaller percentage ofthe total world population. The March 2018 Forbes article entitled ForbesBillionaires 2018: Meet The Richest People On The Planet states that there were2,208 individual billionaires at the beginning of 2018; that their combinedworth was approximately $9.1 trillion; and that the combined worth of the 20richest people was $1.2 trillion. It should be noted that they are not allAmericans. This immense wealth is put into perspective by a January 2017 Oxfampress release entitled Eight people own same wealth as half the world. Thepurpose of this press release is to draw attention to the 2016 Oxfam reportentitled An Economy for the 99%. With reference to the findings of the report,the press release states that,> “…in 2015 the world’s richest one percent retained their share of global> wealth and still own more than the other 99 percent combined.”This group of extremely wealthy people has continued to expand in number, asindicated by the January 2018 Oxfam report entitled Reward Work, Not Wealth,which states that,> “Last year saw the biggest increase in billionaires in history…”According to the report, which corroborates the above cited Forbes article,billionaires not only experienced an increase in their numbers, they alsoexperienced an increase in their combined wealth. The press release web pagethat highlights the publication of the Oxfam report is entitled Richest 1percent bagged 82 percent of wealth created last year – poorest half of humanitygot nothing. The title is self-explanatory, but it demonstrates unequivocallythat, contrary to the claims of the World Bank and others, extreme poverty isnot being successfully reduced.It is a commonly-held belief that the wealth created by industrialists andcorporate owners through their business acumen and skill is beneficial for therest of humanity. It is claimed that corporate wealth will ‘trickle down’ to therest of society, because it will be used to generate employment opportunities,which, in turn, will generate prosperity for the workers. The findings of thetwo Oxfam reports referred to above provide a clear demonstration that thistheory has not been put into practice; none of the increased wealth generated bythe ‘one per cent’ during 2017, had ‘trickled down’ to the almost four billionpeople who comprise the poorest half of humanity, none of whom experienced anyincreased prosperity.It is evident that there are vast inequalities, which, together with theever-widening ‘wealth gap’, provide demonstrable proof that the ‘global agendas’have failed to end or even reduce ‘world poverty’. On the contrary, the policiesof international agencies, especially the IMF and World Bank, contribute notonly to the perpetuation, but to the worsening of poverty; they do notcontribute to its eradication. As Professor Chossudovsky states in his GlobalPoverty article,> “The ‘globalization of poverty’ in the post-colonial era is the direct result> of the imposition of deadly macroeconomic reforms under IMF-World Bank> jurisdiction.”The purpose of this discussion is not to criticise wealth per se; the intentionis to expose the use of wealth for the purposes of exploitation, whether ofpeople or resources. For example, the purpose of the ‘conquest’ of America in1492 was mainly to find and exploit new territories, but it could not haveoccurred without the large funds made available by the king and queen of Spain.Nor could it have been ‘successful’ had it not been accompanied by the bruteforce and violence used by the Spaniards, in combination with deadly weaponssuperior to those possessed by the peoples they ‘conquered’.The most common application of wealth combined with brute force, violence anddeadly weapons has the seemingly respectable label of ‘war’. The need for fundsto prosecute wars has precipitated many monarchs, governments and other leadersin the past, to become deeply indebted to the bankers and financiers thatprovided the necessary funds, usually in the form of interest-bearing loans. Thefunds required to finance the debt repayments to the bankers have almostinvariably been raised through taxes levied on the population; a practice thatpersists to the present day.Although the methods by which wars are funded have changed little, the nature ofwar has changed dramatically. The belief that it is appropriate to wage war inorder to ensure peace, a complete contradiction in terms, has encouraged the‘war industry’ to continue to develop ever more sophisticated weapons that arepurchased by governments and used by the military. War has become a highlylucrative enterprise in terms of industrial output, but it is an extremelycostly enterprise in terms of human life; as acknowledged by Major GeneralSmedley Butler, who, in his book entitled War is a Racket, refers to the ‘warracket’ and states poignantly that,> “It is the only one in which the profits are reckoned in dollars and the> losses in lives.”In his description of the WWI ‘war racket’, Major Butler details the hugeprofits made by certain industries, and explains that the provision of suppliesto the military enabled some industrialists to become millionaires. In asuccinct summary, he states that war,> “…is conducted for the benefit of the very few, at the expense of the very> many.”Towards the end of WWII, however, the ‘war industry’ took weapons development toan unprecedented level with the creation of the atomic bomb, the first realweapon of mass destruction. Devastating though the first bombs were, as attestedto by the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the ‘war industry’ has continued todevelop nuclear technology and produce weapons that are so powerful that, wereonly a fraction of the total to be deployed, they could not only annihilate alllife on Earth, they could potentially destroy the entire planet in the process.Although there has not been a ‘world war’ since 1945, numerous conflicts havebeen waged throughout many parts of the world in the intervening decades. Thesewars have enabled the ‘war industry’ to continue to produce enormous quantitiesof nuclear and non-nuclear weapons, as well as a wide variety of other militaryequipment that generate huge revenues and profits; as indicated by a March 2015article entitled Blood Money: These Companies and People Make Billions ofDollars from War. The article claims that the ‘top’ position in this industry isheld by Lockheed Martin, a US company, whose profits for 2013 are quoted to havebeen $3 billion, which was earned from sales of $35.5 billion. War clearlyremains an extremely profitable ‘racket’.The corporations that benefit from war are not restricted to those directlyinvolved in the ‘war industry’ and the supply of weapons and other militaryequipment; the chemical and vaccine industries are also assured a substantialboost to their revenues and profits, as indicated by the discussion about GWS inchapter seven.War is by no means the only enterprise that is highly profitable for manydifferent corporations. Although they normally conduct their activities withinthe fields of ‘trade’ and ‘commerce’, some corporations have extended theiractivities to matters that would normally be expected to fall within the purviewof ‘government’; as explained by Ralph Nader, who states in his book entitled InPursuit Of Justice that,> “Unfortunately, the modern corporation has come to infiltrate, and dominate,> spheres of society once considered off-limits to commerce: elections, schools,> health-care systems, media, prisons and much more.”It may be assumed that, despite the involvement of corporations in theseactivities, governments nevertheless remain the primary drivers of all relevantpolicies, and that any financial benefits that corporations gain as the resultof such policies are purely incidental; but this would be a mistaken assumption.Through the utilisation of their immense wealth, the owners and decision-makersbehind most large corporations have become capable of exerting a significantdegree of influence in many spheres of society, including politics; as indicatedby Ralph Nader, who, with reference to the US, states that,> “Corporations dominate our political process.”The American political system is one that permits corporations to makecontributions to political campaigns, but these donations are not purelyphilanthropic; as Ralph Nader further explains,> “After they make their contributions, corporations expect their money to buy> access, and it does.”To this statement he adds the comment that,> “They expect this access to yield influence, and it does.”Political and other systems invariably differ throughout the world; however, thegradual encroachment of ‘globalisation’, which requires the ‘harmonisation’ ofrules and systems, will, if fully implemented, completely eradicate all existingdifferences. Furthermore, the dominance of US ‘interests’ will ensure that allother rules and systems will be ‘harmonised’ in line with those that operatewithin the US; a situation that would be disastrous for many reasons, asdiscussed in this chapter.The emergence of the US as the dominant ‘world power’ after WWII is oftenclaimed to be a demonstration of America’s ‘right’ to lead the world. In hisJune 2014 article entitled What Obama Told Us at West Point, Dr Paul CraigRoberts discusses ‘American exceptionalism’ and refers to a speech by BarackObama, who, when US President, had stated that,> “America must always lead on the world stage...”The claim that the US ‘must always lead’ has fostered the belief that UScorporate interests also have the ‘right’ to dominate all other ‘interests’.It is commonly believed that US ‘influence’ is solely exerted by the Presidentand government officials, but this is not necessarily the case. US-basedcorporations in particular, have gained such a significant degree of ‘influence’that they claim the ‘right’ to intervene in the affairs of other countries inorder to protect their own interests.An illustrative example of such an intervention, in which US corporate interestssought preference over the interests of a democratically elected government in asovereign country, is the overthrow of Jacobo Árbenz Guzmán from his position asPresident of Guatemala during a coup d’état in 1954. The reason for his oustingfrom office was claimed to be that his government had been ‘infiltrated’ bycommunists, the sworn enemies of ‘Western democracy’. The real reason was thatPresident Árbenz had implemented agrarian reforms that, amongst other things,granted land to landless peasants; but these reforms posed a threat to theGuatemalan operations of the US-based United Fruit Company, whose officerslobbied the US administration for their assistance to remove this threat. Theresulting coup, which is officially acknowledged to have been carried out by theCIA (Central Intelligence Agency), precipitated the resignation of JacoboÁrbenz, whose successor reversed the land reforms to the benefit of the UnitedFruit Company, but to the detriment of the Guatemalan people.The creation of international organisations has expanded rapidly since theestablishment of the World Bank and IMF in 1944 and the United Nations in 1945.Another international body is the WTO, a Related Organisation of the UN that wasformed in 1995 to govern ‘world trade’ and, according to the WTO website, is,> “…the only international organization dealing with the global rules of trade> between nations.”Like the World Bank and IMF, the WTO is perceived to operate entirelyindependently, but it too, is heavily influenced by US ‘vested interests’. Inhis November 2015 article entitled Corporate Parasites and Economic Plunder: WeNeed a Genuine Green Revolution, Colin Todhunter refers to US influence over allthree organisations and states that,> “With its control and manipulation of the World Bank, IMF and WTO, the US has> been able to lever the trade and financial system to its advantage by various> means...”The Industrial Revolution facilitated the manufacture of goods on a far largerscale than had previously been possible; a situation that increased trade andenabled a relatively small number of industrialists to become extremely wealthy.In addition, advances in technology have facilitated the production of anever-increasing variety of goods in even larger quantities; but these goods needto be sold to increasing numbers of consumers in order for business owners toincrease their wealth. This objective can be accomplished through gainingunrestricted access to ‘foreign markets’; an activity that is often referred toas ‘free trade’.The US Department of Commerce acknowledges that foreign markets may be ‘opened’for the express purpose of benefitting American corporations; as indicated bythe web page entitled Free Trade Agreements, which states that,> “Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) have proved to be one of the best ways to open> up foreign markets to US exporters.”Despite the seemingly innocuous nature of this term, ‘free trade’ is oftenaccompanied by aggressive corporate policies to maximise profits through thereduction of costs, especially wage costs, as indicated by Professor MichelChossudovsky who explains in The Globalization of Poverty that,> “…‘free market’ reforms have contributed ruthlessly to opening up new economic> frontiers, while ensuring ‘profitability’ through the imposition of abysmally> low wages and the deregulation of the labor market.”The WTO supports the promotion of ‘free trade’ within a ‘free market’, but thissupport is not equitably applied across all sectors of ‘trade’. On the contrary,the WTO favours corporate interests rather than those of small local producers,as Professor Chossudovsky further explains,> “Derogating the rights of citizens, ‘free trade’ under the World Trade> Organization (WTO) grants ‘entrenched rights’ to the world’s largest banks and> global corporations.”The WTO, free trade and trade agreements are discussed in detail in the nextsection.A list of the world’s largest corporations and the wealth they generate iscompiled annually by Fortune magazine, which states, on the web page entitledGlobal 500, that,> “The world’s 500 largest companies generated $27.7 trillion in revenues and> $1.5 trillion in profits in 2016.”Interestingly, it is reported that the combined 2016 revenue of the top 500companies in the world substantially exceeded the 2016 GDP of the US, theworld’s largest economy in that year.A proportion of this immense wealth was generated from the exploitation ofworkers through the payment of ‘abysmally low wages’ that kept them in a stateof poverty, despite their employment. Had these people been paid a decent wage,they could have been genuinely lifted out of poverty.Although many are privately-owned, some of the 500 largest companies arestate-owned enterprises; for example, the largest petroleum companies are ownedby the Chinese state. In fact, of the ten largest companies in 2016, four belongto the oil and gas industry, an extremely profitable and powerful industry. Thepower of this industry has been gained, not only through its virtual monopoly ofa major source of energy, but also through the perpetuation of a myth. Asbriefly mentioned in chapter six, it is commonly believed that oil is a ‘fossilfuel’; but this is not the case. The belief is based on an idea that oil isproduced from the compression of fossilised plant and animal remains over thecourse of hundreds of millions of years. The fact that only a finite quantity offossilised remains can exist, has been used as the basis for the idea that onlya finite quantity of oil can exist.One of the main theories associated with the idea that oil is a ‘fossil fuel’was posited in the 1970s; this theory, which became known as ‘Peak Oil’ claimedthat, if extraction continued at the prevailing rate, the earth would soon ‘runout’ of oil. However, not only has the oil industry continued to extract oil inhuge volumes throughout the entire period since the 1970s, it has continued todiscover new oil fields; all of which strongly suggests that the world is notabout to ‘run out’ of oil and that oil exists in far greater abundance than haspreviously been estimated, or admitted.The existence of vast, and possibly unlimited, quantities of oil does not,however, justify its continued extraction, nor does it justify the use ofchemicals derived from oil, known as petrochemicals, in the manufacture of themajority of everyday products. It certainly does not justify the use ofpetrochemical-derived compounds, most of which are toxic, in ‘medicines’ or asingredients of ‘food products’.The interesting ‘alternative’ theory about the origin of oil first emerged inthe mid-20th century. This theory claims that oil is not a ‘fossil fuel’ but is‘abiotic’ in nature; which means that it does not originate from any form ofbiological matter. In his September 2007 article entitled Confessions of an ‘ex’Peak Oil Believer, William Engdahl explains that, in the late 1940s, Russianscientists had begun to conduct investigations into the nature of oil and‘natural gas’ and concluded in 1956 that,> “Crude oil and natural petroleum gas have no intrinsic connection with> biological matter originating near the surface of the earth.”This theory is highly controversial, at least as far as most members of the oiland gas industry are concerned, but there is ample evidence to support it. Thisevidence, which is almost exclusively restricted to Russian science journals,demonstrates that oil originates under the ground at levels that are far deeperthan those at which any fossilised animal or plant remains are possible. One ofthe few scientific papers that is available in English is entitled Anintroduction to the modern petroleum science, and to the Russian-Ukrainiantheory of deep, abiotic petroleum origins. This paper was written by J F KenneyPhD, a geophysicist of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Joint Instituteof the Physics of the Earth, who states that,> “The modern Russian-Ukrainian theory of deep, abiotic petroleum origins> recognizes that petroleum is a primordial material of deep origin which has> been erupted into the crust of the Earth.”This is not merely a ‘theory’; its principles have been implemented with successby the Russian oil industry, which, it should be noted, is one of the world’slargest producers of oil and gas.Furthermore, recent discoveries by NASA (National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration) provide additional corroborative evidence for the assertion byRussian scientists that oil is derived from mineral deposits, rather thancompressed animal and plant remains. A November 2014 article entitled Russiansand NASA Discredit ‘Fossil Fuel’ Theory details NASA’s discoveries of theexistence of hydrocarbons in other parts of the solar system. The scientificinterpretation of these findings is that ‘oil’ is mineral in nature and musttherefore be a renewable resource, not a finite one.The most significant consequence of this discovery is that high prices are nolonger justifiable on the basis of a claim that oil is a ‘scarce resource’.However, it should be noted that some of the most powerful ‘vested interests’involve the members of families that have been involved in and even controlledthe oil industry for decades. The level of control by these people and theirassociates over the oil and banking industries have enabled them at varioustimes to manipulate oil prices to serve their own interests.In Gods of Money, William Engdahl explains that the huge oil price increasesthat occurred during the early 1970s were not ‘natural’, but the result of pricemanipulations by US-based ‘vested interests’ to serve their own purposes. One ofthe main purposes was to save the US economy, because all oil was traded in USdollars; another purpose was to maintain the US position as ‘world leader’. US‘vested interests’ also needed to ensure that the dollar would retain itsposition as the world’s reserve currency after it had been taken off the ‘goldstandard’ in 1971.Although the huge oil price increases benefitted US ‘vested interests’, theywere disastrous for people, whose energy costs had risen by 400 per cent withina very short period of time. These rising energy costs contributed significantlyto the ensuing economic crises experienced within many countries, especiallythose referred to as ‘developing’. But these crises were again used forexploitative purposes, because they facilitated interventions through theimposition of programmes by the IMF and World Bank, known as SAPs, that wereclaimed to provide assistance but, in reality, led to further impoverishment.The oil industry is by no means the only one in which there are highlyinfluential ‘vested interests’; but it is a particularly illustrative example ofthe influence that can be brought to bear, in order to deceive the publicthrough the suppression of an extremely important scientific discovery and theperpetuation of a myth.The use of wealth to gain influence is encapsulated in the saying that ‘he whopays the piper calls the tune’. The extent to which wealth can be used to exertinfluence, and the manner in which wealthy ‘vested interests’ can gain influenceover major international organisations, is explained by Professor James Petrasin his October 2017 article entitled How Billionaires Become Billionaires, inwhich he states that,> “Billionaires buy political elites who appoint the World Bank and IMF> officials…”Corporate wealth is used to exert influence in a variety of ways to ensure thatpolicies are enacted that will favour business interests; the ‘purchase ofinfluence’ is a practice that is better known by the more respectable label of‘lobbying’. Unlike public relations, which aims to influence the public,lobbying aims to influence decision-makers, particularly politicians,policy-makers and law-makers; Ralph Nader explains in In Pursuit of Justicethat,> “…a swarm of lobbyists meet privately with politicians and their minions to> present public officials with corporate wish lists…”Although the presentation of a corporate wish list to a politician does notguarantee a successful outcome, lobbying is sufficiently successful to warrantthe large sums of money corporations are willing to invest in this activity,otherwise the practice would have ceased long ago. It should be obvious,however, that the fulfilment of corporate wishes by public officials underminesthe democratic process; politicians are the elected representatives of ‘thepeople’ and should therefore serve the interests of the people who elected them,rather than corporate interests. Public interests and corporate interests rarelyoverlap; they are often mutually exclusive.Nevertheless, the successful outcomes achieved by lobbyists for their corporateclients have enabled lobbying to become a highly profitable industry thatfunctions in a number of countries, especially the US. The influence oflobbyists in America is described by Lee Drutman PhD in his April 2015 articleentitled How Corporate Lobbyists Conquered American Democracy, in which hestates that,> “Of the 100 organizations that spend the most on lobbying, 95 consistently> represent business.”In the article, he explains that, during the 1960s, lobbyists were morefrequently engaged by public interest groups and labour unions than bycorporations. But, as indicated by the above statement, corporations andcorporate interests now dominate lobbying; a situation that is partly the resultof the increasingly closer cooperation between corporations and governments.These ‘public-private partnerships’ generate a strong system of mutual supportthat can be extremely effective in presenting a ‘consensus’ view, whether or notit is correct. The mutual support that each partner offers to the other partnerscan also be an extremely effective method to counter public opposition togovernment policies that favour corporate interests over those of the public; asLee Drutman explains,> “...the self-reinforcing quality of corporate lobbying has increasingly come> to overwhelm every other potentially countervailing force.”Another mechanism by which corporations can exert influence is the ‘revolvingdoor’ through which government officials and business executives can pass toenter each other’s world; as Ralph Nader states,> “Revolving doors, through which corporate executives glide effortlessly> between private sector employment and government jobs and back again, seem to> be a fixture of every national administration.”The previously cited Blood Money article not only provides details of campaigncontributions by leading military supply corporations to US political partiesand of the millions of dollars spent on lobbying, it also discusses theparticipation of lobbyists in ‘revolving door’ activity, an example of which isthat,> “69 out of 109 Lockheed Martin lobbyists in 2013-14 have previously held> government jobs.”The fundamental problem is that corporations have wrested control out of thehands of elected officials in charge of most of the issues that affect people’slives, as Ralph Nader states,> “Corporate decision-making determines many of the key questions that affect> our lives.”He emphasises that these decisions,> “…are not made through the democratic process…”A country in which corporate ‘vested interests’ rather than politiciansdetermine the content of policies can no longer be correctly described as a‘democracy’; it would be more accurate to describe such a country as a‘plutocracy’, which means ‘rule by the richest’. A plutocracy is a system thattotally excludes the public from involvement in the ‘political process’ anddenies them a voice in any of the decision-making processes.The increasingly close working relationships that exist between governments andcorporations, as well as the support that the former provides to the latter,means that virtually all ‘rules’ favour corporate interests through‘corporate-friendly’ legislation and regulations, as Ralph Nader explains,> “…legislators enact pro-corporate laws which ensure continued growth of> corporations’ mega-wealth.”The main consequence of this is that, as Ralph Nader poignantly indicates,> “…the public pays the price.”It is for this reason that people urgently need to become aware of theincreasing degree of control exerted by ‘vested interests’ over most, if not yetall, of the systems that govern the most important aspects of their lives.Globalisation & The Control AgendaThe term ‘globalisation’ refers in a general context to the interconnectednessbetween people and nations around the globe through improved travel andcommunications systems. More specifically, ‘globalisation’ is the term used torefer to the interconnectedness between nations in order to facilitate ‘globaltrade’.The interconnectedness between people forms the basis of claims that the ‘issuesthat confront humanity’ affect everyone, everywhere, and that all of theseissues can be resolved through the implementation of a single set of policymeasures incorporated into a ‘global plan’, the most recent of which is the 2030Agenda. This ‘global plan’ promotes the formation of a ‘global partnership’ tofacilitate the implementation of all 17 goals and 169 targets; as indicated bySDG 17 that aims to,> “Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership> for sustainable development.”The 2030 Agenda document states that each country has primary responsibility fortheir own development, but adds the statement that,> “At the same time, national development efforts need to be supported by an> enabling international economic environment, including coherent and mutually> supporting world trade, monetary and financial systems, and strengthened and> enhanced global economic governance.”One of the aims of ‘globalisation’ is the complete harmonisation of all of therules that operate within all ‘systems’, not just trade, monetary and financialones; a significant consequence of this would be that countries would only beable to implement policy measures that complied with those of the ‘globalsystems’.It may be assumed that the UN would ensure that these ‘global systems’ wouldoperate for the benefit of everyone, everywhere in order to fulfil the statedpurposes of the UN Charter. But this would be a mistaken assumption, because, asdiscussed, the international organisations of the UN system are heavilyinfluenced by ‘vested interests’ based mainly in the US. It has also beendemonstrated that these ‘US interests’ have asserted the ‘right’ to lead theworld, or, more accurately, to dominate the world. These ‘US interests’ oftenpromote their ‘leadership’ as being for the benefit of humanity, but this is notthe case; their domination is for the benefit of their own interests.In addition to the UN organisations established for the purpose of solvinghumanity’s problems, are a number of US organisations established ostensibly forthe same purpose. For example, in addition to UNDP, the UN ‘development agency’,is a US ‘development agency’ namely, USAID (United States Agency forInternational Development), which claims, on the web page entitled What We Do,that,> “USAID is the world’s premier international development agency…”It is not clear why the world needs two ‘international development agencies’ orwhich of them is the leading agency, but the existence of both raises a numberof questions, not least of which is whether they have the same ‘agenda’. Theanswer to this question would seem to be ‘no’, on the basis that USAID readilyadmits to primarily serving US interests, as demonstrated by the statement onthe same page that,> “USAID’s work advances US national security and economic prosperity…”In addition, on the USAID page entitled Where We Work is the statement that,> “Through our assistance programs, USAID plays an active and critical role in> the promotion of US foreign policy interests.”These ‘assistance programmes’ usually provide financial and other ‘aid’,ostensibly for the purposes of helping other countries to manage certain‘problems’, population growth, for example. Although the issue of rapidpopulation growth in ‘developing’ countries was discussed by the UN in Agenda21, it had been discussed almost two decades earlier by the US in a 1974 reportentitled Implications of Worldwide Population Growth for US Security andOverseas Threats. This report, which remained classified until 1980, will bereferred to as the NSSM 200 (National Security Study Memorandum); the documentcan be accessed from the USAID website. As indicated by its full title, the NSSM200 expressed concern about population growth purely from the perspective of ‘USinterests’ and with respect to the potential impact it may have for ‘USsecurity’. Furthermore, although the NSSM 200 discusses possible strategies toaddress the perceived ‘problem’, it suggests that these efforts should focusonly on certain key countries and states that,> “Assistance for population moderation should give primary emphasis to the> largest and fastest growing developing countries where there is special US> political and strategic interest.”The NSSM 200 indicates that this ‘assistance’ would be provided through USAIDprogrammes, including education programmes for women in ‘developing’ countriesto inform them about various issues, such as limiting their family size throughdifferent methods of birth control. However, the NSSM 200 makes the revealingcomment that,> “Bilateral population assistance is the largest and most invisible> ‘instrument’ for carrying out US policy in this area.”The main purpose of the aid provided by USAID is to further US policy ratherthan further ‘international development’; as indicated by the NSSM 200, which,under the sub-heading Political Effects of Population Factors, states that,> “The political consequences of current population factors in the LDCs ... are> damaging to the internal stability and international relations of countries in> whose advancement the US is interested, thus creating political or even> national security problems for the US.”The US was only concerned about certain countries, which were mainly those withthe resources required by US interests, as the NSSM 200 explicitly states,> “The United States has become increasingly dependent on mineral imports from> developing countries in recent decades, and this trend is likely to continue.”It should be noted that most ‘developing’ countries, including many Africancountries, are rich in a wide variety of minerals and other resources that areextremely valuable for US corporate interests.Many of the concerns about the rate of population growth and its consequencesthat are expressed in the NSSM 200 were carried forward and incorporated intoAgenda 21, Chapter 5 of which states that,> “The growth of world population and production combined with unsustainable> consumption patterns places increasingly severe stress on the life-supporting> capacities of our planet.”Concerns about the growing world population are also expressed within the 2030Agenda, although not described as such. Instead the problem is expressed interms of equality, women’s reproductive rights and the ‘empowerment’ of women;as indicated by SDG 5, the main aim of which is to,> “Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.”The recommendation in the NSSM 200 for women in ‘developing’ countries to be‘educated’ about topics such as reproduction, the ideal family size and birthcontrol methods, remains at the heart of the ‘agenda’; as indicated by SDG 5.6,which states the aim to,> “Ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive> rights…”The discussion about ‘reproductive health’ in chapter eight referred to effortsto encourage pregnant women, especially in ‘developing’ countries, to visitantenatal clinics to receive ‘health care’. These visits also provideopportunities for women to be ‘educated’ about their reproductive ‘rights’ andto be subjected to ‘HIV tests’. Previous discussions have referred to the factthat pregnancy is one of the main conditions known to produce a false-positive‘HIV test’ result, and to the fact that ‘HIV tests’ only detect ‘antibodies’;they do not detect the presence of any virus. Nevertheless, on the basis of thisspurious test, the medical establishment claims that millions of people havebeen ‘infected’ with HIV. Although the erroneous nature of this claim has beendiscussed, the reasons for the perpetuation of fear about ‘HIV’, or any otherallegedly pathogenic ‘virus’, are discussed later in this chapter.Concerns about ‘population growth’ are most frequently expressed in terms of theability to grow sufficient food to feed ever-larger numbers of people, as hasbeen previously discussed. This concern was discussed by the NSSM 200 in thestatement that,> “Growing populations will have a serious impact on the need for food> especially in the poorest, fastest growing LDCs.”However, although the NSSM 200 refers to the continuing need for adequate levelsof food to be produced, which is certainly a matter of importance, theunderlying concern about the large number of hungry people in ‘developing’countries was not for their welfare, but for the potential unrest and politicalinstability that these hungry people may cause in countries where the US had an‘interest’.As discussed in chapter eight, ‘food scarcity’ is a myth; virtually all‘developing’ countries are eminently capable of growing sufficient food withoutusing the detrimental agricultural practices that agribusiness corporationsattempt to impose on them. ‘Modern agriculture’, as practised by the giantbiotechnology and agribusiness conglomerates, utilises toxic synthetic chemicalsas pesticides and fertilisers and promotes GM technologies; it also favours hugeplantations in which single crops can be grown for the export market. This formof agriculture is promoted for ‘developing’ countries on the basis thatincreased exports facilitate ‘economic growth’ and enable ‘development’. Thisidea is promoted by USAID on the web page entitled Economic Growth and Tradethat states economic growth is an important factor for development, and refersto one of the areas in which USAID works, which is,> “Giving people access to markets, where they can sell their goods and services> and play a productive role in their economies.”These are false promises; small businesses do not have the same access to thesemarkets as large businesses. In reality, most markets are controlled bycorporate interests, including the markets for agricultural products. Theconsequences of globalisation and the increasing corporate takeover ofagriculture is demonstrated by the example of India, as explained by VandanaShiva in her previously cited article entitled The Farmers’ Crisis,> “The corporate takeover of Indian agriculture has been facilitated by the> globalisation of agriculture, through the imposition of Structural Adjustment> by the World Bank and IMF, and the trade rules of WTO…”The benefits gained by multinational corporations from the takeover of Indianagriculture, have cost the lives of more than 300,000 Indian farmers who havecommitted suicide due to their unbearable debt burden. As previously discussed,these huge debts accrued as the result of the failure of the ‘Green Revolution’to fulfil its promises of larger crop yields and increased prosperity for thefarmers who adopted it. The ‘Green Revolution’ clearly serves corporateinterests in preference to those of farmers; for example, the oil industry is amajor beneficiary of agricultural practices that require petrochemical-basedpesticides and fertilisers. But the problem is far worse than mere corporategreed.Although promoted as necessary for ‘economic growth’ and ‘development’, theproduction of single crops for the export market destroys local agriculture andtherefore, the ability to produce sufficient food for domestic consumption, theresult of which is the exacerbation of hunger, poverty and ill-health; thispoint is discussed in a June 2017 article entitled Challenging Neoliberal Dogma:Pushing Indian Farmers into Bankruptcy Isn’t ‘Development’! The title isself-explanatory, but the article makes the salient point that,> “The future of our food is being decided by unregulated global markets,> financial speculators and global monopolies.”This situation is an intentional part of the ‘agenda’ for US domination; asProfessor Chossudovsky explains in his Global Poverty article, in which hestates that,> “This US hegemonic project largely consists in transforming sovereign> countries into open territories, controlled by dominant economic and financial> interests.”These dominant interests control many aspects of the ‘world trade, monetary andfinancial systems’ that form part of the ‘enabling economic environment’ toostensibly facilitate ‘development’. But these ‘systems’ operate for the benefitof ‘vested interests’; they do not operate for the benefit of ‘the people’, asthe example of Indian agriculture demonstrates, nor do they facilitate genuine‘development’. In his previously cited article entitled Corporate Parasites andEconomic Plunder, Colin Todhunter identifies some of the ‘vested interests’ andstates,> “The current economic system and model of globalisation and development serves> the interests of Western oil companies and financial institutions (including> land and commodity speculators), global agribusiness and the major arms> companies.”The 2030 Agenda document indicates that the preferential treatment afforded to‘business interests’ has a purpose because,> “Private business activity, investment and innovation are major drivers of> productivity, inclusive economic growth and job creation.”This statement is clearly an attempt to promote the theory that corporate wealth‘trickles down’ to benefit ‘the people’ through the creation of employmentopportunities. But this theory does not operate in the real world, as indicatedby Professor Chossudovsky in his June 2016 article entitled Neoliberalism andThe Globalization of War: America’s Hegemonic Project. In this article, whichwill be referred to as the Neoliberalism article, he explains that the American‘project’ involves ‘economic warfare’ that includes,> “…the imposition of deadly macro-economic reforms on indebted countries as> well as the manipulation of financial markets, the engineered collapse of> national currencies, the privatization of state property, the imposition of> economic sanctions, the triggering of inflation and black markets.”The imposition of ‘reforms’ on indebted ‘developing’ countries, especially inAfrica, began in the late 1970s and has since been extended into most othercountries, including European countries. People in almost every country havebeen forced to suffer the adverse effects of severe austerity measures that havebeen imposed on them by the IMF and World Bank; measures that are claimed to beable to assist countries to ‘better manage their economies’. However, asProfessor Chossudovsky explains, the real purpose of these policies is to enablethe ‘dominant economic and financial interests’ to control the economies of allsovereign countries. In his Neoliberalism article, he explains that the natureof these ‘reforms’ has changed, although not for the better, and states that,since 1997,> “…the IMF-World Bank structural adjustment program (SAP) has evolved towards a> broader framework which consists in ultimately undermining national> governments’ ability to formulate and implement national economic and social> policies.”As previously discussed, the IMF and World Bank have effectively been under thecontrol of ‘US interests’ since their formation in 1944, despite claims that themain purpose of these two institutions is to provide financial assistance tocountries to help end poverty. The controlling ‘vested interests’, which are notsolely US-based, are described by Professor Chossudovsky in his Global Povertyarticle as a ‘New World Order’, about which he states,> “What we are dealing with is an imperial project broadly serving global> economic and financial interests including Wall Street, the Military> Industrial Complex, Big Oil, the Biotech Conglomerates, Big Pharma, the Global> Narcotics Economy, the Media Conglomerates and the Information and> Communication Technology Giants.”The ‘vested interests’ referred to in these discussions include people whocontrol these huge corporate conglomerates; they are therefore the majorbeneficiaries of ‘world trade’, the promotion of which is a key aspect of‘globalisation’ and a major component of the ‘global agenda’, as indicated bythe 2030 Agenda document that states,> “We will continue to promote a universal, rules-based, open, transparent,> predictable, inclusive, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading> system under the World Trade Organization (WTO), as well as meaningful trade> liberalization.”Trade liberalisation is another term for ‘free trade’, which means trade thatoperates without restrictions. Under normal circumstances, ‘free trade’ couldoperate in ways that are ‘non-discriminatory and equitable’, except that thecurrent circumstances are not ‘normal’. The existing trading system, which isthe one promoted by the WTO and other international organisations, is not‘free’, nor is it ‘non-discriminatory’ or ‘equitable’. As discussed, the mantraof ‘free trade’ is used in order to ‘open’ foreign markets and facilitate accessto them for large multinational corporations, not small businesses.Although a Related Organisation of the UN, the WTO has nevertheless been granteda role in the trading system promoted by the 2030 Agenda. The WTO web pageentitled The WTO and the Sustainable Development Goals refers to theincorporation of the 1995 WTO TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of IntellectualProperty Rights) agreement into SDG 3; the page claims that this agreement will,> “…make it easier for developing countries to have a secure legal pathway to> access affordable medicines…”This agreement clearly favours the interests of ‘Big Pharma’.The domination of corporate interests over the global trading system has beenachieved through a variety of means, not least of which involves trade treatiesand agreements. The creation of some of these trade agreements has involved theparticipation of certain ‘interested parties’, that have therefore been able toexert influence over the content to ensure that the agreements will favour theirinterests.Although there are many trade agreements currently in operation, two proposedtreaties require further examination; these are TTIP (Transatlantic Trade andInvestment Partnership), an agreement between the US and EU, and CETA(Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement), an agreement between the EU andCanada. At the time of writing, the implementation of TTIP has been halted,however CETA has been in force ‘provisionally’ since September 2017. Althoughnot yet fully implemented, these treaties require further discussion because ofthe excessive and totally inappropriate ‘rights’ they would confer on corporateentities.One of the most significant aspects of these treaties is that they will imposethe ‘harmonisation’ of rules, the purpose of which is to ensure that the leastrestrictive rules will apply to all parties of the agreements. STOP TTIP is a‘European Initiative Against TTIP and CETA’; the web page entitled TTIP and CETAin detail provides more information about these treaties and states that,> “The main objective of the TTIP is to harmonise to the greatest extent> possible transatlantic rules, regulations and standards…”Contrary to a commonly-held belief, the US does not operate the most restrictiveregulatory systems and practices; it is reported that the US operates some ofthe least restrictive standards. This is a matter of crucial importance because,although the implementation of TTIP was halted in 2016, many provisions of CETA,to which Canada is a major party, are currently applicable. Canadian standards,however, commonly follow those of the US, as explained by William Engdahl in hisMay 2018 article entitled Austria’s New Coalition Betrays on CETA TradeAgreement,> “The Canadian government has largely followed US loose corporate regulations> in recent years…”CETA therefore could be devastating for European countries because the lessrestrictive Canadian standards will be imposed on them. One of the potentiallydevastating impacts for European countries relates to agriculture, as WilliamEngdahl explains in his article with reference to a joint study by the Institutefor Agriculture and Trade Policy and Greenpeace-Holland that is quoted to state,> “Canada has weaker food safety and labelling standards than the EU, and> industrial agriculture more heavily dependent on pesticides and GMO crops.”The full implementation of the provisions of CETA therefore has the potential tooverride existing GMO bans and undermine organic agriculture in EU countries.The consequences of corporate influence over the drafting of trade treaties andagreements, such as TTIP and CETA, are not restricted to the effects onagriculture, they also have the potential to extract huge sums of money fromgovernments, and therefore from taxpayers; Colin Todhunter explains,> “The consequences include proposals for excessive investor rights, which mean> corporations could sue governments for implementing regulations that affect> profits, potentially leading to multibillion euro taxpayer payouts in> compensation.”Through a system called ISDS (Investor-state dispute settlement), the proposalswithin trade agreements, such as CETA, permit an ‘investor’ to bring a casebefore an arbitration tribunal, if they consider that their investment has beenadversely affected by decisions made by the government of a country in whichthey have invested. The ISDS system is being replaced in the EU by a systemreferred to as ICS (Investment Court System), which is claimed to offer betterprotection for investors. Currently, the ICS only applies to bilateralagreements between the EU and other countries; however, it is proposed that ICSshould be extended to apply to all agreements and become a ‘multilateralinstitution’; in other words, it is intended to be applicable globally to alltrade agreements. This system is likely to make governments reluctant to enactlegislation that may potentially be interpreted by an investor as posing athreat to their investment in that country. The implications of such a systemare immense!The WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA), which came into force in February2017, promotes ‘free trade’ and claims to ‘reduce trade costs’ in order to‘boost global trade’. According to the web page entitled Trade facilitation,> “Bureaucratic delays and ‘red tape’ pose a burden for moving goods across> borders for traders.”This trade agreement is discussed in more detail by James Corbett in his articleentitled The Globalist Trade Agreement You Didn’t Hear About, in which heexplains that,> “Under cover of ‘development’ and ‘trade’ … this agreement in fact does little> but penalize the poorest countries by forcing them to adopt standards and> practices that are as expensive and difficult to implement as they are useless> to local industries, farmers and laborers.”The TFA is yet another effort to enforce the ‘harmonisation’ of all processesconnected to ‘trade’; which means that, as James Corbett states, all countriesare forced to,> “…adopt the same standards and regulations on imports and exports.”The justification for the harmonisation of all rules, standards, regulations andprocesses related to all systems is articulated in the UNDP Annual Report for2007 entitled Making Globalization Work for All, which refers to the need forall UN organisations to ‘deliver as one’. The report unsurprisingly claims thatdevelopment is a key aspect of ‘moving forward’, but because nations are not alldeveloping at the same pace, there remain many inequalities, about which thereport states,> “Addressing these inequalities is our era’s most important development> challenge, and underscores why inclusive development is central to the mission> of the UN and UNDP.”Development, trade and economic growth are all central to the globalisationagenda, but the idea of continual economic growth is highly problematic, asColin Todhunter explains in his Corporate Parasites article,> “The model of ‘development’ based on endless GDP growth being sold to the> world via the neoliberal globalisation agenda is a cynical unattainable> con-trick…”GDP (gross domestic product) is an economic measure calculated by reference tothe value of goods and services produced. As previously discussed, the WorldBank assesses the income status of each country by reference to its GNI, aneconomic measure that is calculated from the combination of GDP and certainother income factors.The existence within a country of economic activities, such as the production ofgoods, forms the basis of the idea that these activities can be consolidatedinto a distinct entity that can be referred to as a ‘national economy’. Thisconcept has been extrapolated to apply to the consolidation of all economicactivities of all nations around the globe into a distinct entity that isreferred to as the ‘global economy’. Although certain activities, such asexports for example, can be consolidated and measured, the concept of a ‘globaleconomy’ is highly problematic, not only because it is a concept that has beencontrived solely for the purposes of supporting globalisation, but also becauseit facilitates the notion that this entity called the ‘global economy’ can be,and even ought to be managed.There are many competing economic theories, but it is beyond the intended scopeof this discussion to examine any of them. The purpose of this discussion is tohighlight the fundamental problem common to most, if not all of them, which isthe belief in the existence of a distinct entity that can be identified as a‘global economy’. The reason that this belief is problematic is because itsacceptance permits the ‘global economy’ to be under the full control ofinstitutions that claim to provide ‘sound economic governance’, but insteadimplement policies that serve the ‘vested interests’ that have long held thegoal to control the world’s financial system. In other words, through theircontrol of the policies of international institutions, ‘vested interests’ seekto consolidate their control over what is referred to as the ‘global economy’; asituation that facilitates their control over all of the financial and monetaryaspects of life for everyone, everywhere.The mistaken notion that there is an entity that can be identified as a ‘globaleconomy’, or even a ‘national economy’, is discussed by economist FriedrichHayek in the second of his 3-volume work entitled Law, Legislation and Liberty.In that second volume, entitled The Mirage of Social Justice, he describes an‘economy’ and states that,> “An economy, in the strict sense of the word…consists of a complex of> activities by which a given set of means is allocated in accordance with a> unitary plan among the competing ends according to their relative importance.”People are different and therefore have different priorities; this means thatpeople will invariably allocate resources in different ways according to theirrelative importance to them as individuals; Friedrich Hayek further explains thehighly complex nature of an ‘economy’ and states that,> “What is commonly called a social or national economy is in this sense not a> single economy but a network of many interlaced economies.”The simplification of the complex network of activities that operate within anycountry into a single entity that can be easily expressed by an economic theory,and therefore managed, is fraught with many problems; it is virtually animpossible task. Although this is part of the reason for the failure of mosteconomic policies, another and more pertinent part of the reason is because most‘national economies’ are managed for the benefit of certain ‘vested interests’,which are usually the ‘global economic and financial interests’ that control themonetary systems.Nevertheless, international organisations continue to promote a belief in theexistence of ‘the global economy’; as indicated by the previously cited 2007UNDP Annual Report, which, under the heading Inclusive Globalization statesthat,> “The global economy has been especially strong in recent years, with average> worldwide per capita income growing as rapidly as ever before.”Statistics about ‘averages’ are highly misleading as they fail to disclose thesituation at each end of the range, thereby avoiding exposure of extreme wealthas well as extreme poverty. Furthermore, the UNDP statement that the economy wasstrong is rather surprising considering that the ‘global economy’ in 2007 was inthe early stages of a financial crisis that has been described as the worstsince the depression of the 1930s.Harmonisation is also to be applied to regulations and regulatory systems,including those that govern foods, chemicals management, product safety and theenvironment, to name just a few examples. However, in common with all otherorganisations, regulatory agencies are not immune to the influence of ‘vestedinterests’; as indicated by Dr Peter Breggin, who explains in Toxic Psychiatrythat,> “Regulatory agencies are notorious for coming under the control of the> industries they regulate because the giant corporations have the power and> money with which to buy influence and to obtain favours from government> bureaucrats and politicians.”At the time that Dr Barry Commoner wrote Making Peace With the Planet,environmental organisations were seriously concerned about environmentalpollution caused by industrial activities; as indicated by his statement that,> “The battle lines are predictable: the environmental organizations call for> stricter standards, the corporate lobbyists for weaker ones, with the EPA> reflecting whatever position seems politically expedient at the moment.”The ‘politically expedient’ position taken by the EPA, and virtually all otherregulatory agencies, has been one that favours corporate ‘vested interests’ forreasons that ought to be increasingly obvious. However, a matter of greatconcern is the fact that most environmental organisations have been taken overby factions that promote ‘climate change’ as the major environmental challenge,and deflect attention away from environmental pollution due to industrialactivities; the reasons for this are less obvious, but mainly owe their originsto the influence of other ‘vested interests’, as explained later in thischapter.Although not the only industry responsible for environmental degradation, thechemical industry does bear a significant proportion of the blame for theproblem; however, public attention has been diverted away from the healthhazards of chemicals through the promotion of the idea that chemicals areessential for life; as explained by Sheldon Rampton and John Stauber, in TrustUs, We’re Experts,> “As evidence began to mount in the 1970s about the harmful effects of> chemicals such as DDT, PCBs, vinyl chloride and benzene, companies – including> Mobil Oil, Monsanto and Union Carbide – launched multiple massive advertising> and public relations campaigns, using slogans like Monsanto’s ‘without> chemicals, life itself would be impossible’.”Public relations campaigns are tools commonly used for the purposes ofmanipulating public perception about a variety of issues; as also discussedlater in this chapter.The EPA mainly functions within the US; but, in common with other US agencies,it also intervenes in other countries. The reference to EPA’s programmes on theweb page entitled Where EPA Works Around the World was cited in chapter six, butdeserves repetition; it states that these programmes,> “…allow other countries – especially developing countries and countries with> economies in transition – to benefit from US experience in developing> appropriate and effective environmental programs.”This work would seem to duplicate that of UNEP, the UN’s ‘global environmentalauthority’; which yet again, raises the question of why two agencies arenecessary for the work of protecting the global environment. However, despiteclaims to the contrary, the EPA’s environmental programme is not ‘effective’, asit permits industrial activities that are highly detrimental to the environment.One example is hydraulic fracturing, which is proven to be environmentallydestructive, but continues to be conducted throughout the US. It would seemtherefore, that the EPA prefers to protect US corporate interests rather thanthe US environment.It is commonly believed that ‘developed’ countries, especially the US, maintainstrict regulatory systems; which is cited as a key reason that industries chooseto relocate their manufacturing facilities to ‘developing’ countries; but thisis not the case. As previously stated, the US does not operate the mostrestrictive standards; the main reason for relocating manufacturing facilitiesis to take advantage of the lower costs of production that can usually beachieved in ‘developing’ countries.A further problem with US environmental regulations is explained by BarryCommoner in Making Peace With the Planet, in which he states that,> “There is a basic flaw embedded in the US environmental laws: they activate> the regulatory system only after a pollutant has contaminated the environment> – when it is too late.”The inability of the laws to prevent the release of hazardous materials into theenvironment means that any adverse effects they produce can only be identifiedby epidemiological studies after the event. Epidemiology is defined by theestablishment as,> “the study of the distribution of diseases and determinants of disease in> populations.”Although epidemiological studies are clearly based on the ‘official’, butflawed, theories of disease causation, they were nevertheless able to discoverthe association between smoking and lung cancer. But epidemiology is not immuneto the influence of ‘vested interests’, especially those of the industryresponsible for an environmental hazard; as Dr Devra Davis explains in TheSecret History of the War on Cancer,> “The foundations of epidemiology as a science can’t easily be separated from> the industrial forces that decided what information got released and what> questions were asked and answered.”The influence of ‘industrial forces’ over the information provided byepidemiological studies is unsurprising considering the extent of the hazardscaused by their activities, as Dr Davis also states,> “The result is that what began as an earnest effort to understand the dangers> of the real world has often turned into a way of covering them up.”No matter how thorough epidemiological studies may be, they are virtuallyincapable of detecting the health effects of a single substance amidst theinnumerable combinations of substances that now permeate the environment.Existing environmental regulations permit pollutants to be released into theenvironment if exposure levels are maintained below the level deemed to be‘safe’; but, as discussed, the underlying theory on which these regulations arebased is fundamentally flawed. Nevertheless, human health and the environmentare claimed to be protected by regulatory measures that claim exposures to toxicsubstances are not harmful if they do not exceed the appropriate threshold. JoeThornton explains the problem with the idea of ‘safe thresholds’ in Pandora’sPoison, in which he states that,> “...thresholds provide the intellectual justification for a system of> environmental decision making that benefits toxicologists as a professional> group and the industries that support much of their research.”The ‘vested interests’ that benefit from the denial of environmental hazardsfrom industrial activities clearly include the leaders and owners of theindustries responsible; but they also include the scientists whose careers andsalaries depend on their ability to determine the ‘safe’ level of any substanceor influence that may be hazardous to health, whether chemical orelectromagnetic in nature.It is clear that ‘globalisation’ serves a variety of ‘vested interest’ groupsthat have seized control over many of the systems that govern most aspects oflife, including health, as discussed in the next sections.Control of the Medical SystemThe core aim of the WHO, as stated on the website, is to achieve,> “Better health for everyone, everywhere.”In common with all other issues that confront humanity in the 21st century,ill-health is claimed to be a ‘global problem’ that requires ‘global action’ toimplement ‘global solutions’. But problems can only be resolved if they arefully understood and their causes correctly identified so that the appropriatesolutions can be implemented.To assist with the identification of the various conditions of ill-health, knownas ‘diseases’, the WHO has continued to produce updated versions of the ICD,which, as previously cited in chapter seven, is referred to as,> “…the diagnostic classification standard for all clinical and research> purposes.”The currently applicable version of this standard is ICD-10, which, according tothe WHO web page entitled Classification of Diseases,> “…is cited in more than 20,000 scientific articles and used by more than 100> countries around the world.”This standard is clearly intended to be the definitive ‘global’ reference guidefor the identification of all diseases by all agencies and personnel involved inthe ‘medical system’, referred to in this book as the ‘medical establishment’.Within the ICD classification system, each ‘disease’ is allocated a unique3-character code; for example, rabies is identified by the code A82. However,some conditions have multiple sets of codes; for example, ‘HIV disease’ isallocated 5 sets of codes, namely B20 to B24. In addition, subsets of codes areused to identify variations of the disease; for example, B20.0 refers to ‘HIVdisease resulting in mycobacterial infection’. Therefore, although there aremany thousands of different codes, there is not an equal number of uniquediseases. But, whatever the number of diseases that are claimed to exist, theyare all categorised as either communicable, if caused by ‘germs’, ornoncommunicable, if caused by factors other than ‘germs’, and they are eachtreated by a ‘medicine’ deemed to be the appropriate remedy.It is entirely reasonable to suggest therefore, that, if the medicalestablishment had correctly identified the causes of all forms of disease andwas treating each one with the appropriate ‘medicine’, the incidence of‘disease’ would be in rapid decline, and people everywhere would experienceimproving health; but this is not the case. On the contrary, the incidence of‘disease’ is rapidly rising, and the majority of people everywhere experienceworsening health.The logical conclusion to be drawn from this is that the causes of diseases havenot been correctly identified; this conclusion is supported by the discussionsin chapter seven that revealed the medical establishment’s poor level ofknowledge about the causes of noncommunicable diseases. This logical conclusionis also supported by the discussions in chapter three that revealed theerroneous nature of the theories that claim ‘germs’ to be the causes ofcommunicable diseases.The failure of the medical establishment to correctly identify the real causesof disease means that the methods used to treat and prevent them, namelymedicines and vaccines, are inappropriate ‘solutions’ to the problem. But thisraises the question of why ‘medical science’ does not acknowledge the fullextent of the problem, and instigate a complete re-evaluation of the prevailingtheories about diseases and their causes. It should be clear from thediscussions in this chapter, however, that these theories are retained almostentirely due to the influence of ‘vested interests’.As previous chapters have discussed, there are many reports and articles thathave documented the serious adverse health effects, referred to as ‘sideeffects’, that can be produced by a wide variety of pharmaceuticals. Onearticle, entitled The Epidemic of Sickness and Death from Prescription Drugs,which was cited in chapter eight, highlights one of the problems, which is that,> “Many people, even doctors, assume that if the FDA approves a new drug, it> must be safe, effective, and better; but this is far from actual practice.”The reason that ‘even doctors’ are guilty of this mistaken assumption is due totheir medical education, as discussed in the next section.The CDER (Center for Drug Evaluation and Research) is the division of the FDAthat, as its name indicates, evaluates drugs as part of the approval process.The FDA web page entitled Development & Approval Process (Drugs) states that anevaluation by CDER ‘prevents quackery’, which is clearly intended to suggestthat only FDA-approved drugs are suitable ‘medicines’; but this is misleading.The FDA does not conduct tests to confirm the safety and efficacy of any drugprior to its approval; instead, pharmaceutical companies are required to performtheir own studies of a drug’s ‘safety and efficacy’ and send the study data tothe CDER for evaluation and review. The FDA page states that,> “If this independent and unbiased review establishes that a drug’s health> benefits outweigh its known risks, the drug is approved for sale.”It is a contradiction in terms to suggest that a substance can simultaneouslyconfer health benefits and pose health risks.It is clear that ‘FDA approval’ does not mean that a pharmaceutical drug hasbeen proven to be either safe or effective. This can be demonstrated by the manyreports about drugs that had received FDA approval, but were subsequentlywithdrawn from use when found to cause serious adverse health effects, and evendeath; the example of Vioxx was referred to in chapter seven.The idea that drugs are appropriate for the treatment of disease, even though itis contradicted by the admission that they simultaneously pose risks to health,is perpetuated largely by the pharmaceutical industry that has a clear ‘vestedinterest’ in the continuing existence of a medical system that relies on itsproducts. This problem is discussed in a June 2013 article entitledInstitutional Corruption of Pharmaceuticals and the Myth of Safe and EffectiveDrugs that refers to ‘heavy commercial influence’ in the US. However, thepharmaceutical industry has gained a substantial level of influence that extendsbeyond the US and into many aspects of the entire medical system; the articlestates that,> “The pharmaceutical industry has corrupted the practice of medicine through> its influence over what drugs are developed, how they are tested, and how> medical knowledge is created.”This last point is extremely important; the medical establishment will not beable to reach a true understanding about ‘disease’ or about human health whilstit remains under the influence of the pharmaceutical industry, although theindustry is not the only ‘vested interest’ group that has corrupted ‘healthcare’and gained a significant level of control over the creation of ‘medicalknowledge’.There are some differences between the drug approval procedures that operate indifferent countries, but these remaining differences will be eradicated should‘globalisation’ and its accompanying ‘harmonisation’ be fully implemented. Itshould be noted that the harmonisation of drug approval procedures is already inprogress. The organisation responsible for accomplishing this is ICH(International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements forPharmaceuticals for Human Use), which was founded in 1990. The home page of theICH website states that,> “ICH’s mission is to achieve greater harmonisation worldwide to ensure that> safe, effective and high quality medicines are developed…”The ICH is another international organisation that fully supports the beliefthat pharmaceuticals are safe and effective, but fails to acknowledge theseriousness of the ‘risks’. This bias is almost entirely due to the involvementof the pharmaceutical industry in the harmonisation process; the ICH web pageentitled Harmonisation for Better Health states that,> “Harmonisation is achieved through the development of ICH Guidelines via a> process of scientific consensus with regulatory and industry experts working> side-by-side.”The phrase ‘scientific consensus’ is an oxymoron; as has been discussed,consensus stifles science, which is of particular concern with respect to healthmatters, because consensus will ensure the retention of the prevailing theoriesabout disease, virtually all of which are fundamentally flawed.The ICH is supportive of both the medical establishment system and thepharmaceutical industry; this can be demonstrated by the organisations involvedin ICH, which is funded through annual membership fees. One ICH member is PhRMA,which is the representative body of America’s leading pharmaceutical andbiotechnology companies. Another ICH member is BIO (Biotechnology InnovationOrganization); the About BIO web page states that,> “BIO is the world’s largest trade organization representing biotechnology> companies, academic institutions, state biotechnology centers and related> organizations across the United States and in more than 30 other nations.”Although PhRMA and BIO mainly represent pharmaceutical companies, especially UScompanies, it is interesting to note that BIO also represents academicinstitutions, which constitute another group with a ‘vested interest’ in theprevailing medical system; an interest that arises mainly from the financialrewards that can be gained through medical research funding, as discussed laterin this chapter.The provision of funds, as previously discussed, almost invariably enables theprovider to exert influence over the activities of the recipient. Theorganisations within the UN system are mainly funded by the contributions ofMember States that are assessed according to each country’s GNI. As the countrywith the largest GNI, the US contributes the most to UN agencies, a positionthat the US has exploited. A January 2006 article entitled The World HealthOrganization and the Transition From ‘International’ to ‘Global’ Public Healthexplains that, in 1985, the US took a decision to,> “...withhold its contribution to WHO’s regular budget, in part as a protest> against WHO’s ‘Essential Drug Program’ which was opposed by leading US-based> pharmaceutical companies.”This ‘programme’ is now the Essential Medicines List (EML), which, according tothe web page entitled WHO Model List of Essential Medicines,> “…serves as a guide for the development of national and institutional> essential medicine lists…”The inclusion of their products in the 433 drugs listed on the 2017 EML, andreferred to by the WHO as ‘essential’, is of immense benefit for the drugcompanies that produce them; sales of these products will inevitably boost thecompanies’ revenues and profits. However, pharmaceutical companies are not theonly ‘vested interests’ that benefit from the perpetuation of the prevailing‘medical system’.The general meaning of the term ‘vested interest’ refers to someone with apersonal interest in the outcome of an event. In the context of the medicalsystem, every person employed within that system has a vested interest in itsperpetuation, and will therefore be extremely reluctant to acknowledge theexistence of any flaws. Their reluctance can be a direct result of theirdependence on the ‘medical system’ for their careers and salaries; this loyaltycan be illustrated by a saying attributed to Upton Sinclair that,> “It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends> on his not understanding it.”The protection of careers and salaries can, to a certain extent, explain why themajority of scientists accept the ‘consensus’ view in their field of science andfail to challenge it; as Professor Duesberg indicates in Inventing the AIDSVirus,> “Few scientists are any longer willing to question, even privately, the> consensus views held in any field whatsoever.”This is an extremely worrying situation, as it will prevent any progress in thefield of true ‘healthcare’.Although every person who works in the medical system has an obvious ‘vestedinterest’ in its continuing existence, and would be affected by its demise, thevast majority of these people only have a very limited ‘interest’, which doesnot permit them any real influence over its activities, nor does it permit themto initiate substantive changes. The real ‘vested interests’ are clearly thosewho do have the ability to influence the activities of, and instigate changes tothe ‘medical system’; but they do so purely to serve their own interests. Theyalso benefit from ‘globalisation’ that facilitates the concentration of powerinto a single entity or a coordinated central group.Not only is the WHO the ‘governing body’ of the medical establishment, it isalso the ‘coordinating body’; a position that requires collaboration with avariety of organisations; as the WHO web page entitled Collaborations andpartnerships states,> “One of our core functions is to direct and coordinate international health> work by promoting collaboration, mobilizing partnerships and galvanizing> efforts of different health actors to respond to national and global health> challenges.”One of these ‘health actors’ is the CDC, the US health agency that also operatesbeyond the US borders; the CDC page entitled Global Health states that,> “CDC helps other countries increase their ability to prevent, detect and> respond to health threats…”This statement would seem to indicate that the CDC is another US organisationwhose work overlaps that of a UN organisation, in this instance the WHO. The CDCjustifies its interventions into other countries on the basis that ‘healththreats’ elsewhere in the world pose risks to the health of Americans. Althoughthis is a mistaken notion, the CDC page asserts that,> “The US cannot protect its borders and the health of its citizens without> addressing diseases elsewhere in the world.”The CDC claims that serious threats to ‘global health’ are mainly posed by‘infectious diseases’ that are able to spread rapidly throughout the world. The1918 Flu and Black Death are often cited as examples of the devastation such‘epidemics’ can cause, and used to create fear in the minds of the public. Thisfear is also used to justify continual surveillance around the world to detectany new and potentially dangerous ‘outbreaks’. On the basis of the claim that an‘infectious disease’ outbreak threatens ‘global health’, the CDC collaborateswith various organisations in the promotion of ‘global health security’, whichis discussed on a series of CDC web pages entitled Global Health SecurityAgenda, one of which states that,> “In partnership with US government sister agencies, other nations,> international organizations, and public and private stakeholders, CDC seeks to> accelerate progress towards a world safe and secure from infectious disease> threats and to promote global health security as an international security> priority...”One of the core aims of the 2030 Agenda is to ensure that everyone, everywherehas access to ‘life-saving’ vaccines. Another ‘plan’ with the same goal iscalled the Global Vaccine Agenda Plan (GVAP), which, according to the WHO webpage entitled Global Vaccine Action Plan 2011-2020,> “...is a framework to prevent millions of deaths by 2020 through more> equitable access to existing vaccines for people in all communities.”Previous discussions have demonstrated that vaccines confer no ‘benefits’, buthave been proven to cause serious harm to health, and even death; they certainlydo not save lives. Unsurprisingly, the CDC is also involved with GVAP throughGID (Global Immunization Division), which is part of the CDC and,> “...works closely with a wide variety of partners to protect global citizens> against contagious and life-threatening vaccine-preventable disease...”The CDC certainly serves the interests of the vaccine industry.The term ‘global citizen’ is, however, disingenuous; its use is an insidiousattempt to foster the notion that everyone has a duty to be vaccinated toachieve ‘herd immunity’, which can protect the whole world population. Theerroneous nature of the concept of ‘herd immunity’, as well as the flawed natureof the claims that any disease can be prevented by vaccines, have beendiscussed.The promotion of ‘global health threats’ does however, permit ‘non-healthactors’ to also be involved in matters pertaining to ‘global health’; one ofthese ‘actors’ is USAID, whose work in this area is explained on the USAID webpage entitled Promoting Global Health, which makes a similar claim to the CDCand states,> “Epidemics don’t adhere to international borders.”The intervention of USAID into other countries is justified on the basis of theclaim that epidemics are,> “…invisible threats to our national security.”The purpose of USAID is, however, to promote ‘US foreign policy interests’; thisagency has been involved in many interventions in other countries with differentmotives than that of protecting the health of American citizens. The retentionof a belief in the ‘germ theory’ serves purposes that are entirely unrelated tohuman health, but instead, seem to be more closely related to matters of‘national security’.The WHO also promotes ‘global health’ on the basis that diseases pose threats to‘health security’, as discussed on the web page entitled Health security, whichstates that,> “…universal health coverage and health security are two sides of the same> coin: improved access to health care and strengthened health systems provide a> strong defense against emerging health threats, whether natural or man-made.”The WHO explains the meaning of the term ‘health security’ and states,> “Global public health security is defined as the activities required to> minimize the danger and impact of acute public health events that endanger the> collective health of populations living across geographical regions and> international boundaries.”The concept of ‘collective health’ is misleading. A person’s health is notdependent on the health of others, although it is dependent upon certainfactors, including external ones; it is only in this context that the term‘collective health’ can be used. The Bhopal tragedy in 1984 is an example of anevent that affected, and still affects, the ‘collective health’ of the localcommunity, as discussed in chapter eight. But this is not the context in whichthe WHO refers to ‘collective health’; instead, the WHO uses the term inreference to the idea that ‘infectious diseases’ can be transmitted throughoutcommunities and across international boundaries; this idea is erroneous.The WHO claims that addressing problems related to ‘health security’necessitates the implementation of the appropriate ‘regulations’, namely theIHR, the purpose of which is explained on the web page entitled InternationalHealth Regulations (IHR) that states,> “Their aim is to help the international community prevent and respond to acute> public health risks that have the potential to cross borders and threaten> people worldwide.”The claimed interconnection between UHC and ‘health security’ is used to drivethe agenda to achieve both UHC and increased access to ‘medicines and vaccinesfor all’. These core aims of SDG 3.8 have also been incorporated into a 2017 WHOreport entitled Towards Access 2030, the purpose of which is,> “…to focus and reinforce WHO’s ability to help Member States achieve universal> access to safe and quality-assured health products and universal health> coverage.”The WHO would therefore seem to be oblivious to the overwhelming body ofevidence that demonstrates pharmaceutical medicines and vaccines are not ‘safe’,but are, in reality, responsible for causing a wide variety of adverse healtheffects, including death. Nevertheless, the report refers to the MDGs, whichwere in operation between 2000 and 2015, and states that, during this period,the WHO,> “Strengthened pharmaceutical systems in low- and middle-income Member States.”These ‘strengthened pharmaceutical systems’ have inevitably increased theincidence of ill-health caused by, but rarely attributed to, pharmaceuticals.Instead, these iatrogenic illnesses would have been attributed to the various‘diseases’ that are claimed to disproportionately affect the populations of‘developing’ countries.Disturbingly, however, the Towards Access report asserts that the WHO needs to‘scale up’ efforts to further strengthen pharmaceutical systems during theperiod that the SDGs are in operation. This can only result in an even greaterincidence of iatrogenic ill-health that will predominantly affect the people whoalready suffer from poor health, but will be mistakenly attributed to‘diseases’, for which people will be treated with even more pharmaceuticals. Theworsening of human health will encourage further demands for better access to‘medicines and vaccines’, and produce an ever-worsening vicious cycle ofiatrogenic ill-health and pharmaceutical use that will almost certainly lead togreatly increased mortality.Nevertheless, the efforts to implement UHC by 2030 persist and have beensupported by a newly-formed organisation aptly named UHC2030, which is referredto as a ‘global movement’ whose purpose is described on the web page entitledOur Mission, which states that,> “UHC2030’s mission is to create a movement for accelerating equitable and> sustainable progress towards universal health coverage (UHC).”The web page also provides an explanation about UHC that states,> “UHC is based on the principle that all individuals and communities should> have access to quality essential health services without suffering financial> hardships.”The implication of this mission statement is that Big Pharma is greedy, andtheir prices are too high for the ‘poor people’ in ‘developing’ countries whoare most in need of affordable ‘medicines and vaccines’. It is undeniable thatpharmaceutical companies charge high prices to generate large profits fordistribution to their shareholders, but even if pharmaceuticals were easilyaffordable, or even free, they would not confer health benefits; on thecontrary, they are inimical to health.Other groups with which the WHO collaborates are ‘non-State actors’ that aredescribed on the page entitled WHO’s engagement with non-State actors thatstates,> “WHO engages with non-State actors in view of their significant role in global> health for the advancement and promotion of public health and to encourage> non-State actors to use their own activities to protect and promote public> health.”In addition to NGOs and philanthropic foundations, the term ‘non-State actor’also refers to academic institutions. The scientists who conduct research inthese institutions are believed to be entirely objective and therefore immune toinfluence; but this is not necessarily the case. Most research, especially if itis laboratory-based, requires a significant level of funding. Scientists’careers are therefore dependent on their ability to obtain the necessary funds;but this too can depend on whether the scientist accepts or challenges the‘consensus’ view that prevails in their field. Paul Craig Roberts states, in hispreviously cited article entitled The Oceans Are Dying, that,> “Corporate and government money has purchased many scientists along with the> media and politicians.”The idea that scientists can be ‘bought’ may seem controversial, but as SheldonRampton and John Stauber point out in Trust Us, We’re Experts, ‘scientists’ arehuman and therefore,> “…are not immune from political ideologies or the lure of money.”It is clear therefore that most scientists will conduct research that conformsto the ‘consensus’ view and facilitates the continuation of their career; butthis does not necessarily facilitate scientific progress.Although a number of ‘non-State actors’ are discussed later in this chapter, onefoundation was particularly influential in the development of the Americanmedical system in the 20th century; as discussed in the previously cited GlobalRole article that states,> “In the first few decades following the creation of the United Nations (UN)> and the WHO, there were few major international players with the political> and/or financial clout to influence global agendas.”The article identifies the Rockefeller Foundation as one of those ‘players’ withsignificant financial ‘clout’ that, together with the WHO, UNICEF and the WorldBank, have,> “…heavily influenced global health priorities for research, policy and> investment.”It is important to reiterate that most pharmaceutical products are manufacturedfrom petroleum-derived chemicals. It is similarly important to note that theRockefeller family played key roles in the development of the oil industry inthe US; the wealth generated by the Rockefeller-owned Standard Oil companyenabled the family to virtually control the oil industry. The Rockefellerstherefore, clearly had a ‘vested interest’ in the development of a ‘medicalsystem’ that utilised their products. As discussed in the next two sections, theRockefellers were not only instrumental in the development of the Americanmedical system, they were also involved in ‘medical research’, some of which hadlittle to do with facilitating improved health. The use of petroleum as‘medicine’ arose from the belief that it had curative properties, although it isnow widely recognised to be harmful to health, as indicated by an articleentitled A Look Into the Petrochemical Industry, which states thatpetroleum-derived chemicals can be,> “…hazardous and toxic to the health of living beings and the earth’s> ecosystems.”The article contains an admission that can only be described as astounding inview of the long period during which petrochemical-derived compounds have beenused as ingredients of ‘medicines’; it states that,> “We are still in the early days of understanding the adverse effects of> petrochemicals on our health and environment.”The article is surprisingly honest in its admission of the harm thatpetrochemicals can cause and further states that,> “...they can accumulate in human tissues and organs such as the brain and> liver and cause brain, nerve and liver damage, birth defects, cancer, asthma,> hormonal disorders and allergies.”The reason that petrochemicals remain the major ingredients of ‘medicines’ isdue to the erroneous belief that a harmful substance can be beneficial if usedin the ‘correct dose’; the retention of this belief is clearly of benefit to the‘vested interests’ of the oil industry.As previously discussed, safety tests determine the dose at which there is ‘noobservable adverse effect’; but this is not the same as ‘no effect’.Furthermore, no tests are conducted to determine the adverse effects that arisefrom the myriad combinations of pharmaceuticals and chemical substances to whichpeople are exposed on a daily basis. The denial of the harm to human healthcaused by all of these substances clearly benefits all of the relevantindustries that utilise, produce and discharge these toxic substances.It is clear that there is a vast network of organisations that continue topromote the message that everyone, everywhere needs better access to affordablemedicines and vaccines that are claimed to save lives. The majority of thepeople who work within these organisations do so with the best of motives; inother words, they genuinely wish to help people. The problem is that the peoplewho are not medically trained rely on the ‘expertise’ of those who are; but thisdoes not prevent the promulgation of incorrect information about the nature of‘disease’ and flawed theories about their causes, especially those that relateto ‘germs’. The reason that flawed information remains at the heart of the‘medical system’ is due to the nature of ‘medical education’, which alsooperates under the influence of ‘vested interests’.Medical EducationEducation is the process of imparting knowledge, although it is equally usefulfor the dissemination of false information, as Herbert Shelton indicates inNatural Hygiene: Man’s Pristine Way of Life,> “No man is so confirmed in falsehood as he who has been educated into it...”Although medical school curricula vary, they inevitably include courses thatteach medical students that ‘medicines’ are appropriate treatments for disease;as described by Dr Russell Blaylock in Health and Nutrition Secrets,> “Doctors’ entire educations have been based on a belief in pharmaceutical> agents to treat disease...”In courses referred to as microbiology, pathology, pharmacology and immunology,medical students learn about ‘germs’, diseases, medicines and vaccines. They arealso taught that the knowledge they acquire at medical school representsscientific ‘truth’ and that any other ‘knowledge’ is to be disparaged; althoughpreviously cited, the words of Dr Carolyn Dean yet again, bear repetition,> “In fact, we were told many times that if we didn’t learn it in medical school> it must be quackery.”The term ‘quack’ is used to describe a person who claims to have medicalknowledge, but does not have the appropriate medical qualification and istherefore not allowed to practise ‘medicine’. The term is also used to describesubstances that are used as remedies for illness but have not been ‘approved’ bythe appropriate regulatory body. The purpose of this derogatory terminology isto reinforce the ideas that only those people who have received the appropriate‘medical education’ have the knowledge to practise ‘medicine’, and that onlythose substances that have been approved are suitable ‘medicines’ for thetreatment of ‘disease’. However, as the discussions in this book demonstrate,‘approved’ is not synonymous with effective.An approved medicine is a compound that is claimed to have benefits thatoutweigh its ‘known risks’. These ‘risks’ manifest as adverse health effects,the importance of which is minimised by reference to them as merely ‘sideeffects’; but this label is misleading; all effects are the direct result of the‘medicine’. The main reason that pharmaceuticals cause adverse health effects isbecause their ingredients include petroleum-derived chemicals, which areacknowledged to be hazardous to human health.Another problem is that ‘modern medicine’ focuses on treating the disease, notthe patient. This approach is based on a fundamentally flawed understandingabout both the nature of ‘disease’ and the human body; it does however, providethe most compelling explanation for the otherwise inexplicable circumstances inwhich people with the same ‘disease’ respond very differently to exactly thesame ‘treatment’; this is discussed further in chapter ten.The reason that petrochemicals are used in ‘medicines’ is, at least partly,based on a long-held belief that ‘crude oil’, like many other toxic substances,had curative properties. In her two-volume work entitled The History of StandardOil, Ida Tarbell relates that during the 19th century, ‘crude oil’, also knownas ‘rock oil’, was sold in America as a patent medicine and claimed to be a'cure-all'; she states that,> “While it was admitted to be chiefly a liniment it was recommended for cholera> morbus, liver complaint, bronchitis and consumption…”Although petroleum has become far more important as a source of fuel, it remainsa key ingredient of ‘medicines’, as indicated by a September 2011 articleentitled Petroleum and Health Care that states,> “…nearly 99% of pharmaceutical feedstock and reagents are derived from> petrochemicals…”Oil had been utilised with little, if any, refining throughout many regions ofthe world over the course of many centuries, if not millennia. The modern ‘oilindustry’ is, however, a very different phenomenon; its origins in the late 19thcentury can be almost entirely attributed to the development of technologiesthat facilitated the extraction of oil in ever-greater quantities fromever-greater depths underground. Progress in the field of chemistry enabled‘crude oil’ to be refined and transformed into petroleum, from which usefulsubstances such as petrochemicals were derived. Although oil wells existed inother parts of the world, they had not been drilled and were therefore not deepwells. The drilling technologies developed and used in the US facilitated therapid growth of the American oil industry to the extent that, in the early 20thcentury, the US was the largest oil producer in the world; the largest Americanoil company at the time was the Rockefeller-owned Standard Oil company.The use of their product as medicine was a practice that certain ‘vestedinterests’ within the oil industry were naturally keen to encourage; it isunderstandable that they would therefore seek ways to ensure that ‘medicines’would remain dependent on petroleum. The most effective way, and the one thatwas implemented, would involve the development of a ‘medical system’ that onlypromoted the use of petrochemical-based medicines, in conjunction with a systemof ‘medical education’ that ensured its perpetuation. It should not besurprising therefore, to find that some of the people who were instrumental inthe development of the American medical and ‘medical education’ systems in theearly 20th century held ‘vested interests’ in the American oil industry.The laboratory-based investigation of diseases and their causes had developedrapidly during the 19th century in European countries, especially Germany. This‘scientific approach’ was greatly admired by American physicians, many of whomwere inspired to visit Germany for a course of study at a German university thattaught this method. On their return to the US, most of these physiciansincorporated the information they had gained into their own practices. Others,however, were inspired to develop systems of ‘medical education’ and ‘medicalschools’ similar to those in Germany. In his book entitled Rockefeller MedicineMen, E Richard Brown refers to the example of Johns Hopkins medical school,which was,> “…modeled after the German university medical schools with a heavy emphasis on> research in the basic medical sciences.”He reports that Johns Hopkins was the first medical school to have a laboratoryscience faculty with full-time teachers and researchers. The growing interest in‘scientific medicine’ was to inspire the demand for major changes to thepractice of medicine in the US, as he further explains,> “…the medical profession adopted an effective strategy of reform based on> scientific medicine and the developing medical sciences. Their plan was to> gain control over medical education for the organized profession representing> practitioners in alliance with scientific medical faculty. Their measures> involved large expenditures for medical education and required a major change> in the financing of medical schools.”The demand for change was not universally supported by physicians and thisproduced a conflict within the different factions; however, as E Richard Brownstates,> “The conflict over who would rule medical education…was fundamentally a> question of whose interests the medical care system would serve.”The large expenditures that were required could not be met by physicians; theydid not have the necessary funds to fulfil their plans for a system oflaboratory-based ‘scientific medicine’ and therefore, as he continues,> “The financing of scientific medical schools required tremendous amounts of> capital from outside the medical profession.”The wealthy industrialists and financiers who could provide the necessarycapital were themselves provided with a unique opportunity; as E Richard Brownindicates,> “Those who provided the capital had the leverage to impose policy.”Through the provision of the required capital, wealthy industrialists,especially the Rockefellers and Carnegies, would gain the most influence overthe direction of the American medical system; this began when Abraham Flexnerwas commissioned to investigate and report on the condition of American medicalschools. During his investigations, Abraham Flexner visited Germany and studiedthe German laboratory-based system of medical education, which he too admired.An article entitled The Flexner Report – 100 Years Later states that the Germansystem was,> “…a system in which physician scientists were trained in laboratory> investigation as a prelude and foundation for clinical training and> investigation in university hospitals.”It was laboratory-based research that led Dr Robert Koch to claim that thebacterium, M. tuberculosis was the causal agent of tuberculosis. However, as hasbeen discussed, people can be ‘infected’ by the bacterium but not have symptomsof the disease; these exceptions violate his first Postulate and disprove histheory. Although previously cited in chapter three, the words of Dr PeterDuesberg bear repetition,> “A single exception would be enough to pronounce the microbe innocent of> creating that disease.”Unfortunately, despite the existence of far more than a single exception, themicrobe known as M. tuberculosis has not been pronounced innocent and remainsthe alleged causative agent of tuberculosis. This theory, although thoroughlydisproven by empirical evidence, is retained in the microbiology courses taughtto medical students at medical school, as if it were scientific ‘knowledge’.Nevertheless, the findings of the Flexner Report in 1910 were to inspire acomplete transformation of the American medical education system; the FlexnerReport article states that this transformation was to establish,> “…the biomedical model as the gold standard of medical training.”Yet again, the US is the acclaimed ‘leader’ in the field of medicine; thearticle states that the Flexner Report,> “…resulted in the science-based foundation of medical training that has made> the United States the recognized leader in medical education and medical> research today.”This claim is however, unsubstantiated by the evidence; in reality, the American‘medical system’ fares poorly when compared to those of other ‘developed’countries. A 2017 report prepared by the Commonwealth Fund compared the healthsystems of 11 ‘developed’ countries and placed the US in the last position inrespect of ‘health care system performance’. Most notably, the US was placed inthe bottom position in the category of ‘Health Care Outcomes’; a situation thatchallenges the CDC claim that their work ‘saves lives’. Despite the fact thatthe US spends the largest amount on health care than any other country, theoverall poor performance of the US medical system contrasts significantly withthe idea that the US is the ‘leader’ in medical education and medical research.The ‘medical education’ systems in all countries that have adopted the Western‘scientific approach’ continue to require substantial levels of funding, much ofwhich is provided by the pharmaceutical industry; but this has become acontentious issue, because it is recognised that providing the funds means thatthe industry can exert influence over the content of medical school ‘knowledge’.This problem is discussed in a May 2010 article entitled Funding for MedicalEducation: Maintaining a Healthy Separation from Industry, which states that,> “…in the realm of teaching, whether of medical students, house officers, or> practitioners, there is a growing concern that educational activities should> not be supported or influenced by companies whose profitability and very> existence depend on the sales volume of the products they make.”The funding of education by organisations whose core aim is to make profits,generates conflicts of interest and ethical problems, both of which would seemto be largely ignored, as Dr Carolyn Dean explains,> “An important ethics question that was never addressed in medical school was> whether doctors and medical schools should accept drug company funding.”Despite the failure to address ethical issues or conflicts of interest thatarise solely as the result of pharmaceutical industry funding of medicaleducation, medical school curricula remain biased in favour of the use ofpharmaceuticals as appropriate for the treatment of disease. Medical studentsare therefore taught to regard pharmaceuticals as ‘essential medicines’; thishas been amply demonstrated by the creation of an organisation known as UAEM(Universities Allied for Essential Medicines), which, on the UAEM web pageentitled Who We Are, states that,> “We are a global network of university students who believe that our> universities have an opportunity and a responsibility to improve global access> to public health goods.”The motive of these students would appear to be the desire to help poor people,especially in ‘developing’ countries, to access affordable ‘medicines’, asindicated by the same web page, which, under the heading Our Values, statesthat,> “As committed students from all over the world who passionately believe in> social justice and health equity, we find it unacceptable that millions of> people do not have access to medicines.”Although highly commendable, their passion is, unfortunately totally misplaced,but it is clearly based on the training they have received in medical school,which teaches them that pharmaceuticals are the most, and indeed the only,suitable method by which diseases should be treated. In addition, these studentsare promoting the 2030 Agenda goals, whether knowingly or otherwise, althoughthe language used on this website strongly indicates the former.The UAEM is a movement that began in 2001 when, according to the website,students of Yale University joined with Médecins sans Frontières to influencethe University and a major pharmaceutical company in order to convince them,> “…to permit generic production of a critical Yale-discovered HIV/AIDS drug in> sub-Saharan Africa…”The idea that medical students were able to influence a major pharmaceuticalcompany and gain a concession from them is rather extraordinary, the industry isnot noted for philanthropy, especially when their profitability is threatened.Yale University, however, had a clear vested interest in the drug it haddiscovered and would inevitably benefit from its sales. According to thewebsite, the concession also resulted in price reductions for other drugs,which,> “…enabled a major scale-up of HIV treatment throughout the continent.”The fundamental problems with ‘HIV’ and ‘HIV treatments’ have been discussed.The belief that it represents a genuine disease continues to be promoted bywell-meaning, but misinformed, people, such as the UAEM students. Meanwhilemillions of people continue to be harmed on a daily basis by the toxic ARV‘medicines’ with which they are treated. Even more heart-breaking is the factthat the genuine health problems with which these people suffer remain almostentirely unrecognised, and largely ignored by the medical establishment.Medical education does not, however, cease after students have obtained theirqualification. All qualified doctors are required to attend courses for CME(continuing medical education), which also inevitably receives a substantiallevel of funding from pharmaceutical companies; the above cited May 2010 articleabout medical education funding states that,> “The most direct form of industry-supported education is through funding for> continuing medical education (CME) activities.”An August 2014 article entitled Industry involvement in continuing medicaleducation, which mainly discusses the situation in Canada, indicates that theproblems arising from industry funding are ubiquitous. The ability to fund CMEenables the industry to exert influence over the content of courses in a numberof ways, as the article states,> “…CME with industry involvement has a narrower range of topics and more> drug-related content than CME without direct industry involvement.”The influence of commercial activities that enable financial gains to be madefrom pharmaceutical products and medical devices pervades the entire medicaleducation system, as the article indicates,> “Faculty members or their institutions, such as medical schools or teaching> hospitals, may also hold shares of patents and thereby derive financial> benefit from the use of particular drugs, devices or tests.”It should be clear that all of the people who derive a financial benefit fromdrugs, tests, patents, or any other commercial product, hold a ‘vested interest’in the perpetuation of a ‘medical system’ that utilises the product.Although the increasingly sophisticated technical equipment used in laboratoryexperimentation and medical student training is generally equated with ‘medicalscience’, this is a mistaken view. Experiments are not necessarily synonymouswith ‘science’; as Professor Duesberg explains in Inventing the AIDS Virus,> “The transition from small to big to mega-science has created an establishment> of skilled technicians but mediocre scientists, who have abandoned real> scientific interpretation and who even equate their experiments with science> itself.”The limitations of ‘scientific experimentation’ were discussed in chapter three."},{"pageContent":"Another form of ‘further education’ available in the US to medically trainedpeople is a CDC programme called EIS (Epidemic Intelligence Service), a 2-yearpostgraduate training programme. The CDC web page entitled What EIS Officers Dorefers to them as ‘disease detectives’ and explains that,> “EIS officers serve on the front lines of public health, protecting Americans> and the global community…”EIS officers comprise some of the key personnel that travel to the location of adisease ‘outbreak’, whether in the US or elsewhere in the world. Their functionis to carry out the necessary investigation to identify the cause of the diseaseand to implement the appropriate solutions to contain the problem. The pageentitled Who We Are claims that more than 3,600 EIS officers have been trainedsince the programme was established in 1951. It is interesting to note that EISofficers have been appointed to some rather important and influential positionswithin the ‘medical system’; as the page also states,> “EIS alumni have gone on to become CDC directors; leading CDC scientists;> acting surgeons general; WHO assistant directors-general, regional directors> and country directors; public health and medical school faculty and deans;> city health commissioners; and state epidemiologists.”Even more significantly, EIS officers have been appointed to important andinfluential positions outside of the ‘medical system’; as the page states,> “Many others take on leadership roles in industry, foundations,> nongovernmental organisations and the news media.”These influential positions ensure the perpetuation of the prevailing ‘medicalsystem’.Medical students are also taught about ‘mental health’ in order to be able todiagnose ‘mental disorders’, which are claimed to affect increasing numbers ofpeople around the world. Dr Peter Breggin states that conditions diagnosed as‘mental disorders’, especially depression, are far more likely to be amanifestation of ‘overwhelming emotions’ caused by the stresses and strains oflife. Unfortunately, students are taught about the appropriate ‘medicines’ thatcan be prescribed for such conditions, but, as Dr Breggin explains on the webpage entitled Empathic therapy: psychotherapy, not psychoactive drugs,> “Blunting ourselves with drugs is not the answer to overwhelming emotions.”The failure to recognise that emotions are normal human functions and notindicative of a ‘mental disorder’ has serious consequences; as he furtherexplains,> “Unfortunately, when health professionals are taught to rely on the> prescription of psychoactive drugs, they are in effect instructed how to> suppress the emotional lives of their patients and clients.”Interestingly, medical students and practising doctors are also reported toexperience ‘mental health problems’, as indicated by an April 2019 BMA articleentitled Supporting the mental health of doctors and medical students, whichrefers to the situation in the UK and states that,> “At any one time, a proportion of the medical workforce is managing a> diagnosed mental health condition of their own.”The symptoms reported to be experienced by people in the medical workforceinclude depression, anxiety, burnout and stress. The problem with categorisingthese symptoms as ‘mental health problems’ is discussed further in chapter ten;however, it is worrying that people who are responsible for the health of theirpatients can be considered to have ‘abnormal thoughts, perceptions, emotions andbehaviours’.It is clear that physicians, psychiatrists and medical students have aparticularly strong ‘vested interest’ in the perpetuation of the prevailing‘medical system’. The many years of study required to attain their qualificationwill ensure that their beliefs in the ‘system’ in which they were trained aredeep-seated. It can therefore be extremely difficult to overcome this beliefsystem and acknowledge the many flaws inherent within ‘modern medicine’.Although the difficulties are understandable, they are not insurmountable; asdemonstrated by the many qualified physicians quoted in this book who discoveredthe problems and have spoken or written about them. The most obvious situationthat alerts a physician to the existence of problems within the ‘medical system’is the failure of their efforts to improve a patient’s health, despite the useof the recommended treatments; this is recognised by Dr Derrick Lonsdale MD whostates in his book, Why I Left Orthodox Medicine, that,> “...it is sometimes difficult for a physician to observe that his treatment is> making things worse.”Another serious criticism that can be levelled at the content of ‘medicaleducation’ is the failure to include an adequate level of training on the topicof ‘nutrition’. The almost total omission of any reference to the importance ofnutrition is even more surprising considering that the WHO includes ‘unhealthydiet’ as one of the key risk factors for NCDs, although, as discussed in chapterseven, the WHO defines ‘unhealthy diets’ mainly in the context of the dietaryintake of salt and sugar; this is woefully inadequate.Nevertheless, the inclusion of ‘unhealthy lifestyles’ as risk factors fordisease, means that doctors are increasingly advised to inform their patientsabout adopting a ‘healthy lifestyle’, but few of them have the necessaryknowledge, as medical school training is invariably deficient on the topic. Thisdeficiency has been highlighted in a September 2017 article written by two UKmedical students and surprisingly, published on the website of the BMJ. Thearticle, entitled Medical schools should be prioritising nutrition and lifestyleeducation, refers to claims that European medical schools provide more coursesabout ‘healthy lifestyles’ than those in the US, but states that all medicalschools are deficient in this regard.The article claims that the reason for this deficiency is because ‘nutritionscience’ is subordinated in medical school curricula and that,> “Dietary interventions are considered to be outside of the evidence base,> unscientifically ‘fluffy’ and the domain of dieticians rather than doctors.”This is entirely the wrong approach to nutrition, the importance of which cannotbe overstated, as discussed in more detail in chapter ten.The main problems with the ‘medical system’ arise from the dependence on flawed‘science’ and the use of highly technical laboratory equipment. This isexacerbated by beliefs about the nature of diseases and by ideas that theircauses can be discovered by the examination of ‘diseased’ cells, tissues ormolecules. These flawed ideas and beliefs are perpetuated through theirinclusion in the curricula of ‘medical schools’. The dependence upon science inthe field of medicine is accompanied by claims that scientists who madeimportant discoveries are to be regarded as the experts in their field and theirwork is not to be challenged; but, as Professor Krimsky states in Science in thePrivate Interest,> “...we rarely have the luxury of questioning whether the expertise is> trustworthy.”The expertise of certain ‘scientists’, such as Edward Jenner and Louis Pasteurfor example, has been shown in previous discussions to be untrustworthy; yet themedical establishment continues to regard them as some of medicine’s greatestheroes; these accolades are undeserved. Unfortunately, too few physicianschallenge the medical system in which they were trained, even when theirexperience demonstrates the existence of serious problems with the methods theywere taught to employ.Education is clearly important, but as EF Schumacher states in Small isBeautiful: A Study of Economics as if People Mattered,> “More education can help us only if it produces more wisdom.”Wisdom can never be produced through ‘education’ that disseminates erroneousinformation based on flawed theories.It is clear that the art of healing was lost when transformed into the ‘scienceof medicine’ that is only practised by qualified ‘medical doctors’ who have beeneducated in an approved ‘medical school’. It should be equally clear that‘modern medicine’ does not perform ‘healing’, it only ‘treats’ disease.It is ironic that this ‘scientific medical system’ was created in order toprotect people from ‘quackery’; yet the practice of ‘modern medicine’ is basedon a number of erroneous beliefs that are not substantiated by the empiricalevidence. These beliefs are not only perpetuated through ‘medical education’they are sustained through ‘medical research’.Medical ResearchMedical research is a core component of the ‘medical system’.The purpose of medical research was discussed in a February 2013 editorial inThe Lancet; this article, appropriately titled What is the purpose of medicalresearch? argues that suitable replies would state,> “…to advance knowledge for the good of society; to improve the health of> people worldwide; or to find better ways to treat and prevent disease.”Despite public perception that these are indeed the objectives of medicalresearch, The Lancet editorial states that, in reality, the situation is ratherdifferent and that instead, research has become an extremely lucrative activity,the scale of which is that,> “About $160 billion is spent every year on biomedical research.”But this huge level of expenditure is far from cost-effective; the editorialrefers to a 2009 study article whose authors,> “…estimated that 85% of research is wasteful or inefficient…”This level of waste and inefficiency ought to be a matter of serious concern tothe medical research community, but it would seem to be an ongoing problem. Theeditorial refers briefly to some of the sources of the problem, one of which isthe failure to assess the relevance or importance of a research project prior toits commencement. Other concerns that were raised refer to the failure to assesswhether the research was ‘unbiased’, or even ‘clinically meaningful’.The existence of pharmaceutical industry bias in medical research is undeniable;industry research is conducted almost exclusively for the purpose of developingmarketable products, especially medicines and vaccines, from which large profitscan be made. Although research costs are high, they are invariably recouped whenproducts reach the marketplace; as indicated by Dr Carolyn Dean in Death byModern Medicine,> “The bias of medical research makes it search for a patentable drug that will> eventually pay for the costly studies necessary to bring it to market.”But this industry bias is inappropriate; in her book entitled The Truth Aboutthe Drug Companies, Dr Marcia Angell MD refers to,> “…a growing pro-industry bias in medical research – exactly where such bias> does not belong.”There is another form of bias in medical research, which is that funding grantsare almost always allocated to research projects that support the ‘consensus’view. Fortunately, there are some scientists who do not follow the ‘consensus’;but, unfortunately, as Dr Paul Craig Roberts explains in his previously citedarticle entitled The Oceans Are Dying, those who are able to maintain theirindependence do so under rather difficult circumstances,> “The independent scientists who remain have great difficulty obtaining funds> for their research, but the corporate scientists have unlimited funds with> which to lie.”A pertinent example of the difficulties faced by independent scientists whochallenge the ‘consensus’ view, is the loss of funding experienced by ProfessorDuesberg when his research, which revealed that ‘HIV’ was not the cause of AIDS,was published, as discussed in chapter four. The preference for only fundingresearch projects that preserve the ‘consensus’ also exists in the field of‘mental health’; Dr Peter Breggin explains in Toxic Psychiatry that,> “The search for biochemical and genetic causes keeps psychiatrists, as medical> doctors, in the forefront of well-funded research in the field.”The erroneous nature of the idea that ‘mental disorders’ are either ‘genetic’ or‘biochemical’ in origin has been discussed.A key focus of medical research is the investigation of disease; as previouslydiscussed, the ICD is the internationally-recognised ‘standard’ for theclassification of diseases for both clinical and research purposes. The use ofthis definitive guideline by the research community ensures that diseases areinvestigated solely in the context of their ICD definition, which inevitablyperpetuates the ‘consensus’ view. But this approach places severe restrictionson the nature of ‘medical research’, especially investigations of diseasesbelieved to be ‘infectious’ and the mistaken idea that they are caused by‘germs’. Although medical research invariably facilitates the development ofmedicines and vaccines for use in a clinical context, this does not mean thatthe research has therefore been ‘clinically meaningful’; as demonstratedthroughout this book, pharmaceuticals are inimical to human health, notsupportive of it.It is abundantly obvious that pharmaceutical companies benefit significantlyfrom the revenues generated by the medicines and vaccines developed as theresult of medical research, however, medical schools and universities may alsobenefit financially from such research projects, as Dr David Michaels explainsin Doubt is Their Product,> “Universities and university scientists have enrolled in joint ventures and> profit sharing arrangements with chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturers.”The campaign led by Yale University students to reduce the price of generic‘HIV’ drugs, as discussed in the previous section, was the inspiration behindthe creation of the UAEM movement that now operates in a number of countriesaround the world. The website claims that,> “The campaign showed those students that, as major contributors to drug> development, universities are well positioned to influence the way medical> technologies are developed and distributed, and thus can do much to help> alleviate the access-to-medicine crisis.”A lack of access to medicine is not a crisis; on the contrary, the real crisisis the use of ‘medicine’ in the continuing, but mistaken, belief thatpharmaceuticals provide the only solution to the very real problem of‘ill-health’. This mistaken belief is compounded by the continuing failure ofthe medical establishment to conduct genuine ‘medical research’ into the natureof ‘disease’ and discover the real causes. Research projects that wouldundertake genuine investigations of that nature do not occur for a number ofreasons, one of which is that the pharmaceutical industry, which is one of themain funding sources of research, would not benefit financially because thoseprojects would not result in marketable products. It is clear therefore, thatthe industry has a ‘vested interest’ in the existing form of ‘medical research’.It is equally clear that the entire medical research community has a similar‘vested interest’ because their careers and salaries depend on the continuingexistence of the system in which they were trained. A successful career in thissystem is dependent upon certain factors, as described by Professor Duesberg inInventing the AIDS Virus,> “The successful researcher – the one who receives the biggest grants, the best> career positions, the most prestigious prizes, the greatest number of> published papers – is the one who generates the most data and the least> controversy.”But the generation of data and the avoidance of controversy are not synonymouswith ‘science’. In a further reference to successful researchers ProfessorDuesberg states that,> “They pride themselves on molding data to fit popular scientific belief...”This approach is contrary to genuine ‘science’, which holds that evidence isprimary.One of the most popular beliefs in the field of medicine is the theory that‘germs’ cause disease. Although erroneous, it is a core belief to which medicalresearchers continue to mould their data. Researchers who study diseases claimedto be ‘infectious’ do so on the basis of the assumption that ‘germs’ are thecausal agents, despite the complete lack of knowledge about the mechanisms bywhich microorganisms are able to induce the wide variety of symptoms associatedwith these diseases.The main purpose of most ‘medical research’ is to lead to the development of‘medicine’. Most laboratory-based research studies begin with the ‘discovery’that a particular chemical compound produces an effect perceived to be‘beneficial’ on a cell, tissue or molecule. When certain tests, usuallyperformed on animals, indicate that the compound may be ‘clinically meaningful’for humans, it will be developed into a drug that will be tested in clinicaltrials. These human trials are conducted in four ‘phases’, the first three ofwhich, referred to as Phase I, Phase II and Phase III, evaluate the drug’seffectiveness and assess its ‘side effects’; in all three phases the human testsubjects are healthy volunteers.If a drug proceeds successfully through these three phases and its ‘benefits’are deemed to outweigh its ‘risks’, study data are submitted to the appropriateregulatory agency for approval; different approval procedures may of courseapply in different countries. However, if successfully approved, the drug willenter Phase IV, in which it is introduced onto the market and prescribed to thegeneral public; this phase is also referred to as ‘post-marketing surveillance’.It is during this stage that the drug is prescribed to people diagnosed with the‘disease’ for which it was developed; in other words, by definition these peopleare not healthy, which is the reason that Phase IV is the most important stageas far as the general public is concerned.During Phase IV, not only is the drug taken by people who are not healthy, it isoften taken for much longer periods of time than the duration of clinicaltrials. Many drugs are recommended to be taken for many months, years or evenfor the rest of a person’s life, whereas the drug may only have been tested overthe course of a few weeks or months. It is, therefore, only during Phase IV thata drug’s long-term ‘side effects’ can be ascertained, by which time it may haveharmed many people. If these ‘effects’ are considered to be sufficientlyserious, the drug may be withdrawn from the market, but this is not always thecase; thalidomide for example, remains in use as a treatment for a certain typeof cancer, although it is no longer prescribed for pregnant women.Clinical trials are another activity that may be relocated to ‘developing’countries to take advantage of cheaper labour and other costs, althoughminimising costs does not necessarily compromise the quality of the trials. Amatter of more serious concern, however, relates to the ethical nature ofclinical trials, wherever they may be conducted. This problem is discussed in a2008 briefing paper, appropriately titled Unethical Trials, that was produced bythe Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations (SOMO). According to thispaper, ethical norms are contained within the Declaration of Helsinki (DoH)which asserts that,> “The research is only justified if there is a reasonable likelihood that the> populations in which the research is carried out stand to benefit from the> results of the research.”The SOMO paper describes a study in which an antihypertensive drug was tested onbabies that were acknowledged to be ill, although the nature of their illness isnot disclosed. Nevertheless, whether or not the babies had been diagnosed assuffering from hypertension, 49 of them died during the trials; the drug wasclearly toxic. With reference to unethical trials in general, the paper makesthe sobering comment that,> “...the scale of the problem is unknown, because it cannot be estimated how> many unethical trials escape public attention and therefore remain unnoticed.”The publication of research study papers in a medical journal is regarded as anextremely important aspect of the work of researchers. However, in his April2016 article entitled What are medical journals for and how well do they fulfilthose functions? Richard Smith, former editor of the British Medical Journal,states that more than a million studies are published each year in more than20,000 medical journals. Interestingly, he concludes that,> “Medical journals are now a poor way to publish science…”Nevertheless, research study papers continue to be published in medical journalsafter they have passed the peer review process, which is widely promoted as the‘gold standard’ of science. In Trust Us, We’re Experts, authors Sheldon Ramptonand John Stauber explain that,> “In theory, the process of peer review offers protection against scientific> errors and bias.”But this is another situation in which the reality differs from the theory dueto the influence of ‘vested interests’, as they further explain,> “In reality, it has proven incapable of filtering out the influence of> government and corporate funders, whose biases often affect research> outcomes.”The process of ‘peer review’ is recognised to be fraught with problems, asRichard Smith explains in his article about medical journals,> “Quality assuring research is poor as we know that most published findings are> false and it’s not surprising as peer review is fraught with problems and> lacks evidence of effectiveness.”The comment that ‘most published findings are false’ refers to a 2005 articleentitled Why Most Published Research Findings Are False, in which the author, DrJohn Ioannidis MD, states that,> “…for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be> simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias.”This statement highlights one of the many problems with the ‘peer review’process, which is that it relies on and perpetuates the prevailing ‘consensus’view and denies the publication of research that challenge this consensus. Thisis discussed by Dr Breggin in Toxic Psychiatry, in which he describes peerreview as,> “...one more old-buddy network guaranteeing that critical viewpoints never see> the light of day while badly flawed studies supporting the establishment are> rushed into print.”One example of the ‘network’ closing ranks against a critical viewpoint is thecase of Dr Andrew Wakefield, whose work revealed an association betweengastrointestinal problems and autism and implicated the MMR vaccine, which poseda serious threat to the vaccine industry. Although his research paper had passedthe ‘peer review’ process and been published by a respected medical journal, itwas subsequently retracted and is now reported as ‘fraudulent’ and‘discredited’.The influence of the pharmaceutical industry over the publication of medicalresearch study articles is widely recognised to be a problem. In his essayentitled Medical Journals Are an Extension of the Marketing Arm ofPharmaceutical Companies, Richard Smith quotes Richard Horton, a former editorof The Lancet, who stated in 2004 that,> “Journals have devolved into information laundering operations for the> pharmaceutical industry.”Richard Smith refers in his essay to the publication of studies, which showbeneficial results from a new drug or vaccine, as an effective method ofpublicity and states,> “For a drug company, a favourable trial is worth thousands of pages of> advertising...”Although it may be assumed that a published research study demonstrates ascientific ‘truth’, this would be a mistaken assumption; Dr Ioannidis explainsin his above cited 2005 article that,> “Published research findings are sometimes refuted by subsequent evidence...”Medical journals are also heavily influenced by the pharmaceutical industry, butonly partly as the result of the advertising revenue they receive. The industryalso employs other, more effective, tactics, one of which is to employ‘ghostwriters’. In Trust Us, We’re Experts, the authors quote science writerNorman Bauman, who describes ghostwriting, and states that it includes,> “…hiring freelance writers to write articles for peer-reviewed journals, under> the byline of doctors whom they also hire.”It is generally assumed that the named authors listed on a published article arethe researchers who conducted the study; but this is not necessarily the case,as ghostwriting would seem to be increasingly commonplace. Professor SheldonKrimsky explains in Science in the Private Interest that,> “...there is a ghostwriting industry in science and medicine.”But this is not a new industry, as Dr Carolyn Dean explains in Death by ModernMedicine,> “According to Sergio Sismondo, drug companies have been paying ghostwriters to> produce papers for decades...”In ‘medical science’, unlike in fiction, ghostwriting does not merely provideassistance for a ‘less able’ writer, as Dr Leemon McHenry PhD explains in his2010 article entitled Of Sophists and Spin-Doctors: Industry SponsoredGhostwriting and the Crisis of Academic Medicine,> “This practice, however, goes beyond simple drafting of a manuscript; it> provides an academic façade for research...”The existence of this practice refutes the claim that the peer review andpublication process represent a ‘gold standard’ system. However, although an‘academic façade’ is a matter of concern, the implications of the practice ofghostwriting are far more profound, as he states,> “Such camouflaged authorship undermines scientific integrity and jeopardizes> public health.”Another, more troubling, tactic used by the pharmaceutical industry is referredto as ‘ghost management’, which is described by Professor Sergio Sismondo in hisSeptember 2007 article entitled Ghost Management: How Much of the MedicalLiterature is Shaped Behind the Scenes by the Pharmaceutical Industry. In hisarticle he explains that ‘ghost management’ exists when,> “…pharmaceutical companies and their agents control or shape multiple steps in> the research, analysis, writing, and publication of articles.”The full extent of this industry is unknown because its activities remainlargely hidden from view; its effects are more conspicuous because, as ProfessorSismondo states, ghost management permits,> “…the pharmaceutical industry considerable influence on medical research and> making that research a vehicle for marketing.”The extent of pharmaceutical industry influence over all aspects of medicalresearch, including the writing and publication of study articles, raisesserious concerns. Dr Blaylock explains in Health and Nutrition Secrets that,> “...most editorial staff members of these scientific journals, as well as> editors-in-chief, also receive research funding from pharmaceutical companies,> and even hold stock in the companies from which they take money.”This clearly raises the issue of ‘conflicts of interest’, a problem thatProfessor Sheldon Krimsky has investigated in the wider field of science,although his findings are also applicable to ‘medical science’. In Science inthe Private Interest, he explains that,> “Scientific conflicts of interest are taken much less seriously than> allegations of fraud or misconduct...”He cites an example of a conflict of interest that arose from a rotavirusvaccine ‘approved’ by the FDA in 1998 and states that,> “Within about a year after the vaccine had been licensed, it was removed from> the market after more than one hundred cases of severe bowel obstruction were> reported in children who had received the vaccine.”Professor Krimsky refers to the conflicts of interest that were discoveredduring the investigation and showed that,> “...the advisory committees of the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control> were filled with members who had ties to the vaccine manufacturers.”This type of ‘conflict of interest’ is increasingly common and a clearmanifestation of the ‘revolving door’ in action.Dr Arnold Relman MD, like his wife Dr Marcia Angell, was a former editor of theNew England Journal of Medicine. In 1980, Dr Relman wrote an editorialexpressing his concern about the involvement of physicians with drug companies,which, he states, represents a conflict of interest with the duty physicians oweto their patients. In his book, Professor Krimsky quotes Dr Relman’s suggestionthat,> “...practicing physicians should derive no financial benefit from the> health-care market except from their own professional services.”The same should also apply to the scientists involved in ‘medical research’.There are clearly many problems with ‘medical research’, most of which are thedirect result of the influence of the pharmaceutical industry that is solelyinterested in developing marketable ‘healthcare’ products.However, other ‘vested interests’ have instigated ‘medical research’ projectsfor purposes that have little, if anything, to do with healthcare. Oneparticular series of projects involved the investigation of methods to reducefertility in both men and women with a view to solving the alleged problem of‘population growth’. This research was originally incorporated into ‘eugenics’,which, contrary to popular belief, began in England in the late 19th centurywhen Francis Galton coined the term. However, interest in the topic soon spreadto America, where it was turned into a popular movement.As previously discussed, the NSSM 200 expressed concerns in the 1970s about therapid rate of population growth, especially in ‘developing’ countries; but theseconcerns were couched in terms of the potential effect on ‘US political andforeign policy interests’ and on US ‘national security’; the document statesthat,> “The proposed strategy calls for a coordinated approach to respond to the> important US foreign policy interest in the influence of population growth on> the world’s political, economic and ecological systems.”However, ‘research’ into effective birth control methods had begun during theearly decades of the 20th century. Some of the research was funded by theRockefeller Foundation and is recorded in the Foundation’s annual reports; the1968 report provides an update on the progress of the research and states that,> “...several types of drugs are known to diminish male fertility, but those> that have been tested have serious problems of toxicity.”This report also states that,> “Very little work is in progress on immunological methods, such as vaccines,> to reduce fertility, and much more research is required if a solution is to be> found here.”The report announces that the Foundation would offer funding for furtherresearch into ‘immunological methods’.Some decades later, ‘medical research’ finally discovered a mechanism by whichfemale fertility could be interrupted; as indicated by a November 1993 articleentitled Functional and immunological relevance of the COOH-terminal extensionof human chorionic gonadotropin beta: implications for the WHO birth controlvaccine that states,> “The World Health Organisation (WHO) Task Force on Birth Control Vaccines has> selected the pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) as a target> molecule for a contraceptive vaccine.”HCG is a female hormone that supports the normal development of an egg in thewomb, but can be suppressed by ‘anti-hCG antibodies’; this suppression is themechanism on which the development of a ‘birth control vaccine’ was based. Thevaccine was tested in clinical trials in a number of countries, one of which wasIndia. A 1994 article entitled A vaccine that prevents pregnancy in womenreports on the trials and states that,> “The present study provides evidence for prevention of pregnancy in women by> circulating anti-hCG antibodies.”The vaccine is claimed to be effective when ‘antibody titers’ reach a certainlevel, however, this level must be maintained by regular injections or‘boosters’. The article reports that, in the trials, it was discovered that whenbooster injections were no longer applied, the ‘titers’ declined and fertilityeventually returned, although often after a period of many months. It should benoted that one of the funding supporters of this clinical trial was theRockefeller Foundation.Another ongoing research programme with immense and potentially disastrousimplications for human health, and therefore a matter of serious concern,involves the topic referred to as ‘gene editing’, which is described on theGenetics Home Reference web page entitled What are genome editing andCRISPR-Cas9? that states,> “Genome editing (also called gene editing) is a group of technologies that> give scientists the ability to change an organism’s DNA.”The ultimate goal of this research is to use these technologies to alter humanDNA; the page also states that,> “These technologies allow genetic material to be added, removed, or altered at> particular locations in the genome.”The discussion about GMOs in chapter six referred to the problems that havearisen from the genetic engineering of plant seeds. It also referred to the factthat the underlying assumption of genetic engineering, which is that each geneencodes for a unique protein, was proven by the Human Genome Project to beentirely unfounded. Nevertheless, the GHR page states that,> “Genome editing is of great interest in the prevention and treatment of human> disease.”The diseases of most interest to these researchers are those considered to be‘genetic’ in origin; the page states that,> “It also holds promise for the treatment and prevention of more complex> diseases, such as cancer, heart disease, mental illness and human> immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.”These diseases have all been discussed and shown not to be caused by faultygenes.The manipulation of human genes, even if claimed to be for the purpose oftreating ‘disease’, clearly has immense ethical implications. The NuffieldCouncil on Bioethics began an enquiry into the ethical issues of gene editing inSeptember 2016 and published a report in July 2018. The key findings of thisreport, entitled Genome editing and human reproduction: Social and ethicalissues, are that,> “We conclude that the potential use of heritable genome editing interventions> to influence the characteristics of future generations could be ethically> acceptable in some circumstances…”This can only be described as outrageous; it is especially so because, asdiscussed, diseases are not ‘genetic’; they cannot therefore, be treated by themanipulation of a person’s genes. There is, however, a more sinister aspect tothis research. In his July 2018 article, aptly-titled Son of Frankenstein? UKBody Backs Human Embryo Gene Editing, William Engdahl correctly asserts thatgene editing,> “…belongs in the category of eugenics.”On the basis that fertility-reducing vaccines also belong in the same category,it is not surprising to find the same ‘vested interests’ involved in bothprojects. William Engdahl states that the supporters of gene editing researchinclude the Rockefeller Foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, majorpharmaceutical companies and GMO seed companies; he also states that,> “The methodology of manipulating a specific part of a DNA chain to change> human embryos is based on flawed scientific reductionism, which ignores the> complexity of biophysical reality and of the fundamental laws of nature.”Although the European Court of Justice ruled in July 2018 that gene editing isto be treated as GM and to be subjected to the same regulations, the existenceof regulations will not deter ‘vested interests’ from continuing such research.Promulgating DeceptionsThe 2030 Agenda represents the most recent version of the efforts of theinternational community to solve the problems that confront humanity in the 21stcentury. The Transforming Our World document claims that ‘the public’ wasincluded in the preparation of the goals and targets of the Agenda; as indicatedby the statement that,> “The Goals and targets are the result of over two years of intensive public> consultation and engagement with civil society and other stakeholders around> the world…”The ‘public’ involved in the consultation processes would only have been smallrepresentative groups; implementation of all of the 2030 Agenda goals andtargets, by comparison, requires engagement with most, if not all of the people.The strategies to increase public awareness of the Agenda and gain support forthe implementation of the solutions have included the creation of organisationssuch as Global Goals, which claims, on the web page entitled The 17 Goals, that,> “These goals have the power to end poverty, fight inequality and stop climate> change.”The prominence of these three aims suggests that they are the most importantgoals; this is, however, part of the deception.The organisation behind Global Goals is Project Everyone, whose mission isdescribed on the Global Goals web page entitled Project Everyone, which statesthat,> “Our mission is to ensure that everyone on the planet knows what the Global> Goals are so that they stand the greatest chance of being achieved.”The Project Everyone website claims that,> “Project Everyone seeks to put the power of communications behind the> Sustainable Development Goals, also known as the Global Goals.”In addition to utilising the ‘power of communications’ to increase publicawareness, Project Everyone employs highly emotive language to persuade peopleof the importance of these goals; as can be seen by the statement that urgescampaign supporters to,> “Be the first generation to end extreme poverty, the most determined> generation to end inequality and injustice and the last generation to be> threatened by climate change.”It is clear that many of the ‘Global Goals’ identify genuine problems thataffect large numbers of people around the world; demands that these problems aresolved are therefore laudable. Unfortunately, most of the people involved inthese projects and campaigns unquestioningly believe and support theestablishment narrative, and are completely oblivious of the flawed nature ofthe theories on which a number of the goals have been based.It is important to reiterate that problems can only be solved if they have beenfully understood and their causes have been correctly identified.The information the public receives about the issues contained within these‘Global Goals’ is almost invariably promulgated by ‘experts’, who are perceivedto understand the problems and therefore should not be challenged or evenquestioned. Yet, in many cases there are equally qualified ‘experts’ who dochallenge those ‘experts’, but are increasingly marginalised or even preventedfrom promulgating their views through mainstream media channels. A pertinentexample of this situation can be seen in the promotion of the idea that ‘climatechange’ poses one of the greatest threats to humanity and the accompanyingvilification of those who refute this idea.This does, however, raise the question of how ‘vested interests’ are able toinfluence scientific ‘experts’ and ensure that they support the consensusrelating to ‘climate change’, or any other aspect of the agenda. The response tothis question requires reference to the fact that most fields of ‘science’ havebeen manipulated to the extent that ‘science’ no longer performs its intendedpurpose; but instead, has become a dogmatic discipline that demands strictobedience to the ‘consensus’ view and thwarts any view that challenges that‘consensus’. This is recognised in a February 2001 article entitled The NewThought Police Suppressing Dissent in Science, which explains that,> “Science has seldom lived up to its ideal as an open, disinterested enquiry> into nature, as any scientist who has ever tried to publish genuinely new> ideas or findings in the 'peer-reviewed' scientific journals will know too> well.”If ‘science’ had remained open and disinterested, a number of the issues thatare said to confront humanity would be less severe and many would not evenexist.The reason that the 2030 Agenda goals are based on flawed theories is not solelydue to the failure of ‘experts’ to fully understand the nature and causes of theproblems, it is also due to the influence of ‘vested interests’ that seek todominate and control the actions to be taken to resolve these problems. Thepresence of these ‘vested interests’ can be seen by the reference to ‘otherstakeholders’ in the Transforming Our World document, which provides no furtherdetails about this group of ‘interested parties’.It should be noted that the influence of ‘vested interests’ is not exclusive toscience; it has permeated virtually all fields of enquiry.The influence of ‘vested interests’ and the promulgation of deceptions to thepublic about the ‘Global Goals’ can certainly be seen in SDG 3, which relates to‘health’, the main topic of this book. The flawed nature of the theoriesrelating to ‘infectious diseases’, especially ‘HIV’, malaria and tuberculosis,which are referred to as ‘epidemics’ that need to be ended, has been discussed.Although ill-health is a genuine problem that needs to be resolved, the proposedsolution that includes increasing access to affordable medicines and vaccineswill exacerbate the problem, not solve it, as has been demonstrated throughoutthis book.Another flawed Global Goal is SDG 2 which refers to solving the problem ofhunger, but contains erroneous ideas about nutrition. The reason that themedical establishment fails to fully understand ‘nutrition’ is mainly because itis claimed to be ‘unscientific’, ‘fluffy’ and to belong in the domain ofdieticians not doctors. This flawed perception of nutrition is the justificationfor the existence of few, if any, nutrition courses in medical school curricula.This is also deceptive, because ‘good nutrition’ is central to ‘good health’.The Global Goals web page entitled Healthy Not Hungry recognises the connectionbetween hunger and ill-health and states that,> “Achieving zero hunger and good health go hand in hand…”The Healthy Not Hungry campaign involved Project Everyone, WFP and UNICEF andwas intended to increase awareness of and make progress towards achieving bothSDG 2 and SDG 3; surprisingly, however, this campaign did not involve the WHO orany other ‘health’ organisation.IMPACT 2030 is another effort to promote greater awareness of the 2030 Agenda;the website explains that,> “IMPACT 2030 is a private sector-led initiative, in collaboration with the> United Nations, social and public sectors, and academia, with the unique> mission to activate human capital investments through employee volunteer> programs to advance the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals> (SDGs).”It is interesting to note that the Founding Partners of this ‘private sector-ledinitiative’ include GlaxoSmithKline, Dow Chemical and Pfizer. An IMPACT2030document entitled Human Capital Investment for Sustainable Development statesthat,> “We believe that corporations are a valuable resource uniquely poised to help> respond to the needs of a rapidly changing world.”This would seem to suggest that corporations can and will help to addresshumanity’s problems, but this is yet another deception. A corporation’s corepurpose is to provide shareholders with a return on their investment; this meansthat making profits is a far more important priority for them than solvinghumanity’s problems. The response of corporations, especially those withinindustries that contribute to the problems, is to provide solutions that benefittheir interests. The pharmaceutical industry, for example, which is responsiblefor contributing to human health problems, has a clear ‘vested interest’ inpromulgating the deception that medicines and vaccines will achieve Goal 3. Thechemical industry, for another example, which is responsible for contributing toenvironmental pollution, has a clear ‘vested interest’ in promulgating thedeception that chemicals can solve many problems, such as increasing foodproduction through ‘Industrial Agriculture’ that will help to feed the hungrypeople of the world.Another interesting international organisation is the World Economic Forum(WEF), a not-for-profit foundation based in Switzerland which states on the webpage entitled Our Mission that,> “The Forum engages the foremost political, business and other leaders of> society to shape global, regional and industry agendas.”The WEF would seem to duplicate the work of the UN; this can be seen moreclearly in the statement on the web page entitled Improving the state of theworld, that,> “The Forum creates impact by gathering leaders from business, government,> international organisations, academia, civil society and youth to work> together to drive positive change.”The engagement of business leaders in an international ‘think tank’ that shapesthe global agenda, is another method by which ‘vested interests’ are able toexert their influence, and ensure that the ‘agenda’ conforms to their preferred‘consensus’ views that serve their interests. Although not part of the UNsystem, the WEF nevertheless supports the 2030 Agenda; the web page entitledSustainable Development Impact Summit refers to the summit held in September2018 and states that,> “Accelerating progress on the Sustainable Development Goals and Paris> Agreement commitment requires global dialogue, deeper public-private> cooperation and wider application of Fourth Industrial Revolution> technologies.”The reference to the Paris Agreement demonstrates that the WEF is a firmsupporter of the ‘consensus’ view about climate change. The claim that progresson the 2030 Agenda requires ‘wider application’ of technologies is of extremeimportance. A January 2016 WEF article entitled The Fourth IndustrialRevolution: What it means, how to respond explains that,> “The First Industrial Revolution used water and steam power to mechanize> production. The Second used electric power to create mass production. The> Third used electronics and information technology to automate production.”The page claims that the Fourth builds on the Third and that,> “It is characterized by a fusion of technologies that is blurring the lines> between the physical, digital, and biological spheres.”There are profound and very disturbing implications of the fusion oftechnologies with biology; the notion that this represents ‘progress’ is basedon fundamentally flawed ideas that the human body is essentially a ‘machine’ andthat the brain is little more than a ‘processor’ that can be likened to acomputer.Yet again, nothing could be further from the truth.Developments in technology have certainly enabled people to be interconnected inways that have never been previously possible; the article refers to a number ofinnovations such as,> “…emerging technology breakthroughs in fields such as artificial intelligence,> robotics, the Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, 3-D printing.> Nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials science, energy storage, and quantum> computing.”The article claims that, like the three previous Industrial Revolutions, thetechnologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution have,> “…the potential to raise global income levels and improve the quality of life> for populations around the world.”As previously discussed, the first Industrial Revolution, which introducedmechanisation into factories, only increased the income level and improved thequality of life for a very small group of people, mainly the industrialists andfinanciers; whereas ‘the people’, in stark contrast, fared rather poorly andinequalities increased. The same occurred as the result of the Second and ThirdRevolutions. The Fourth Revolution has the potential to do likewise, as thearticle admits,> “In addition to being a key economic concern, inequality represents the> greatest societal concern associated with the Fourth Industrial Revolution.”Technologies that lead to greater inequalities are incompatible with the coreaim of the 2030 Agenda to reduce inequalities; they cannot therefore be regardedas a means by which the goals of the Agenda can be attained. This is yet anotherexample of a proposed solution that will exacerbate an existing problem ratherthan resolve it. Nevertheless, the ‘vested interests’ within technologycompanies associated with the WEF will inevitably be fully supportive of theidea that ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies’ are essential toaccelerate progress on the 2030 Agenda.One of the many strategies employed by ‘vested interests’ to maintain theirinfluence and control, is to ensure that the theories that favour theirinterests are firmly embedded into the establishment consensus, even if theconsequences are damaging to human health and the environment; David Michaelsexplains in Doubt is their Product that,> “Polluters and manufacturers of dangerous products also fund think tanks and> other front groups that are well known for their antagonism toward regulation> and devotion to ‘free enterprise’ and ‘free markets’. There are dozens of> these organizations working on behalf of just about every significant industry> in this country.”These strategies involve a variety of activities; Andrew Rowell explains inGreen Backlash that,> “Overtly and covertly, by stealth and by design, big business has perverted> the democratic process by buying politicians, by bribing them, by funding> ‘independent’ think tanks, by forming ‘corporate front groups’, by bullying> citizens, by lobbying and by lying – all in the name of profit.”It is clear that ‘vested interests’ employ a large range of activities toinfluence and control the information promulgated to the public, who remainlargely unaware that they have been, and continue to be, deceived about almostall aspects of their daily lives.PR & PropagandaPublic relations (PR) is a marketing tool used by many businesses to provide thepublic with information about their products and services. This information,often in the form of a press release, is intended to generate interest in, andtherefore purchase of, the organisation’s products and services. Press releasesare also used by non-commercial entities; the WHO, for example, issues newsreleases to notify the public about matters such as the latest ‘diseaseoutbreak’. The Chartered Institute of Public Relations web page entitled What isPR defines PR as,> “…the discipline which looks after reputation, with the aim of earning> understanding and support and influencing opinion and behaviour.”In Toxic Beauty, Dr Samuel Epstein refers to some of the organisations that haveused PR to protect their ‘reputations’,> “The FDA, NCI and ACS spend millions of dollars on public relations in> attempts to reassure the public they are doing a good job, despite their lack> of progress.”PR is clearly intended to inform the public, but it can also be used tomisinform them; an example is the April 1984 press conference at which it wasclaimed that the probable cause of ‘HIV’ had been found; the deceptive nature ofthis claim has been discussed.Propaganda, which is said to differ from PR, is defined by the Oxford Dictionaryas,> “false or exaggerated information, used to win support for a political cause> or point of view.”The function of propaganda is therefore to inform the public, but to do so forthe purposes of promoting a cause or an ‘agenda’ of some description.The main difference between PR and propaganda would seem to be that the latterinvolves the deliberate use of false or misleading information; in other words,propaganda is intended to be deceptive. Nevertheless, PR and propaganda have asimilar underlying function, which is to influence people in order to achieve aspecific objective. This similarity can be largely attributed to Edward Bernays,often referred to as the ‘father of public relations’ who wrote a book entitledPropaganda in which he states that,> “The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and> opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those> who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible> government which is the true ruling power of our country.”He continues with the statement quoted at the beginning of this chapter,> “We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas> suggested, largely by men we have never heard of.”A simple interpretation of these statements would be that they refer to theunknown people who are the heads of major corporate entities and employ PR tomanipulate public tastes and ideas to generate consumer demand for theirorganisation’s products and services. However, the idea that consumers are thedriving force behind the production of goods is misleading; Barry Commonerexplains in Making Peace With the Planet that,> “There is a popular myth that in America ‘the consumer is king’, issuing> commands for new products that are obediently met by producers.”This seemingly innocuous ‘myth’, although a successful marketing ploy, isdeceptive because it obscures the reality that manufacturers serve their owninterests, not those of consumers. This means therefore, that consumers havelittle influence over the products that most industries produce, as he furtherstates,> “...the change in production technology ...is initiated by the producer and is> governed by the producer’s interests.”One of the major changes in production technology was the manufacture ofsynthetic chemicals, often derived from petroleum, and their use as ingredientsof the vast majority of consumer products. This change cannot be attributed toconsumer demand, as people would not knowingly have commanded manufacturers tocreate products using inherently toxic substances that are harmful to theirhealth and the environment. This is clearly a process that has been initiated byproducers, as the vast majority of consumers are completely oblivious of thehazards posed by many of the everyday household products they use, and theprocessed food products and drinks they consume.The lack of public awareness of these hazards can be partly attributed to ageneral assumption that these products would not be on the market if they wereunsafe. Most efforts to convince the public about product safety involvereference to ‘risk assessments’ and scientific evidence that are claimed todemonstrate that the product and its ingredients are ‘safe’ when used asrecommended. But it has been shown that the vast majority of chemicals have notbeen tested for their safety or for the full extent of any potential healthhazards they pose; these claims must therefore be seen as PR rather than‘science’; as John Stauber and Sheldon Rampton explain in Trust Us, We’reExperts,> “In order to understand the manipulations that are practiced today in the name> of science, it is necessary to understand the particular habits and practices> of a particular class of experts who specialize in the manipulation of> perception itself – namely, the public relations industry.”Commercial entities, especially large corporations, certainly seek to influenceand manipulate public tastes and opinions in order to promote their products;but this is not the only valid interpretation of Edward Bernays’ previouslycited statements. The ‘true ruling power’ of which he writes is held by thosereferred to in this book as ‘vested interests’, whose power extends beyond theborders of the US and into many countries around the world. Although theindividuals that comprise this ‘ruling power’ are invisible to the public, theeffects of their influence are discernible in the increased level of powerwielded by ‘global’ organisations that collaborate with corporations andgovernments, and in the decreased level of power and independent actionpermitted to ‘the people’.It has been established that opinions and beliefs can be relatively easy tomanipulate by people perceived to be an ‘authority figure’ or ‘expert’; this isfurther explained in Trust Us, We’re Experts,> “When psychologists have explored the relationship between individuals and> authority figures, they have found that it can be disturbingly easy for false> experts to manipulate the thinking and behaviour of others.”A well-known example of an investigation of this nature is the series ofexperiments conducted by psychologist Stanley Milgram in the 1960s. The purposeof his experiments was to determine the extent to which study participants wouldobey instructions given by an ‘authority figure’, even though their actionsappeared to inflict harm on other people; it must be noted that nobody wasactually harmed. These experiments revealed a disturbingly high level of publictrust by the participants in the ‘authority figure’, who was merely playing arole for the purposes of the experiments.The fact that the majority of people will trust an ‘authority figure’ has beenexploited by ‘vested interests’ in various ways, not least of which is byensuring that information they wish the public to believe is promulgated by‘experts’ that represent an ‘authoritative body’. The WHO and the World Bank areboth perceived as ‘authoritative’, therefore the public will almost certainlybelieve reports issued by these organisations and not realise that thisinformation forms part of the ‘agenda’. An example of this can be seen in a June2015 joint WHO/World Bank press release entitled New report shows that 400million do not have access to essential health services that claims,> “…6% of people in low- and middle-income countries are tipped into or pushed> further into extreme poverty because of health spending.”The purpose of this joint press release is to promote the idea that there is anurgent need for people who live in poverty to have Universal Health Coverage andbetter access to ‘essential health services’; in other words, this press releaseanticipates the 2030 Agenda that was agreed to by the UN later that same year.The ‘essential health services’ the press release refers to include: childimmunisation; antiretroviral therapy; tuberculosis treatment; and ‘familyplanning’. None of these ‘services’ are essential for human health, but they areall essential for the profitability and even the survival of the pharmaceuticalindustry. Interestingly, the Rockefeller Foundation is included as one of thesupporters of the report referred to in this press release.It is not disputed that many people who live in poverty face the dilemma ofwhether to spend their meagre income on food or ‘medicines’. Unfortunately,however, all too many of them choose the latter instead of the former under themistaken belief that ‘medicines’ will improve their health. The claim that manypeople have been further impoverished by their ‘health spending’ contradicts thepreviously cited World Bank claim that the number of people living in extremepoverty has declined. Furthermore, as has been discussed, loans issued by theWorld Bank and IMF to ‘developing’ countries are subjected to certain conditionsthat invariably involve reductions to government spending in order to meetinterest and loan payments. These spending reductions affect the country’shealth budget and diminish any existing health services; it is clear thereforethat the World Bank is responsible for reducing, not improving health services.It must be noted that the joint press release does state that ‘health services’should include better access to clean water and sanitation, which wouldcertainly promote better health. However, water is not made ‘clean’ or ‘safe’ bytreatment with chlorine or any other toxic disinfectant chemical.Another effective method by which public opinion can be manipulated is throughfear. This strategy is often used by the medical establishment, in conjunctionwith their reliance on the public’s trust in ‘authority’, to perpetuatedeceptive ideas that ‘infectious diseases’ are caused by dangerous ‘pathogens’and pose serious threats to health, but can be prevented by vaccines. Althoughmost people continue to believe these ideas, there is a growing awareness thatvaccines are not as safe as they are claimed to be, which clearly poses a threatto the vaccine industry. The increasing number of people who refuse to bevaccinated or have their children vaccinated has provoked recommendations withinthe medical establishment to introduce mandatory vaccination programmes, butthis has been met with some resistance; as indicated by a July 2017 articleentitled UK doctors re-examine case for mandatory vaccination on the website ofthe BMJ, that states,> “Mandating childhood immunisation continues to be contentious in the UK…”One of the responses to this article was written by Jackie Fletcher, the motherof a child she claims was damaged by the MMR vaccine and the founder of JABS, asupport group for the parents of vaccine-damaged children. In her response, shereports that the JABS group includes parents who are also part of the medicalestablishment; however, when asked to speak out about the dangers of vaccines,she states that they,> “…have told us of their fears for their reputations, promotion prospects, even> their final pension plans.”These fears are likely to have resulted, at least in part, from the campaignthat has successfully discredited Dr Andrew Wakefield and his work; it istherefore unsurprising that medical doctors and researchers are reluctant to besubjected to the same disgraceful treatment. Although their response isunderstandable, there is a more important issue at stake, which is that theirreluctance prevents greater awareness of the reality of the problem. This leadsto the painful but urgent question of how many more children have to suffervaccine-damage before members of the medical establishment who are aware of theproblem, but fearful for their reputations, careers and pensions, end theirsilence and speak out.It should be noted that not only is there a Vaccine Damage Payment system in theUK, but the MMR vaccine is included in the list of vaccines for which a paymentmay be made, subject, of course, to certain conditions.It may be argued that, because only a very tiny percentage of children are‘damaged’, it is reasonable to refer to vaccines as ‘safe’. The suitableresponse to such an argument should include reference to two important points;firstly, that the existence of a single exception is sufficient to refute arule; but there are far more than a single exception, as many people, especiallychildren, have been damaged by vaccines. Secondly, vaccines are acknowledged toproduce ‘side effects’, which are reactions that result from the administrationof the vaccine, they are therefore ‘direct effects’. If all of these ‘sideeffects’ were recognised as ‘vaccine-caused damage’, which is what they trulyare, the deceptive nature of the claim that vaccines are ‘safe’ would soonbecome apparent to everyone.The idea that vaccines are effective is also proven to be deceptive by theacknowledged existence of ‘vaccine failures’. According to a January 2016article entitled Primary vaccine failure to routine vaccines: Why and what todo, ‘non-responsiveness’ to a vaccine,> “…is currently described by the inability of the host/vaccine to mount> sufficient protective antibody responses after primary or booster> vaccination.”This ‘problem’ is claimed to only affect between two and ten per cent of healthyindividuals; but again, this is a clear demonstration of exceptions that refute‘the rule’. Although this is the proportion of healthy people who may notrespond to vaccine, the situation is rather different with respect to people whoare not healthy. The article claims that certain factors, such as age, chronicdiseases, allergies and obesity, affect the immune system and therefore affectthe way people with these conditions respond to vaccines. According to thearticle, these ‘human-related factors’ for non-responsiveness to vaccines,> “…are more difficult to define and underlying mechanisms of vaccine failure> are largely unexamined or unknown.”This is yet another huge ‘knowledge gap’ that would seem to be ignored by themedical establishment, which continues to promote the claim that vaccines areone of the greatest ‘achievements’ of modern medicine; this claim, which hasbeen proven to be erroneous, must therefore be viewed as propaganda, notinformation.Another strategy used by some PR companies involves diverting public attentionfrom the real causes of certain problems, especially environmental pollution, asAndrew Rowell indicates in Green Backlash,> “It is also the job of the PR companies to shift the blame of pollution from> their corporate clients onto the public at large.”A more egregious PR or, more accurately, propaganda strategy involves thecreation of a campaign that includes reports by ‘experts’ to vilify anyone whochallenges the ‘consensus’ view and discredit their work. This tactic has beenused to discredit scientists and others who are also ‘experts’ in their field.Dr Epstein states in Toxic Beauty that,> “A more subtle layer of public deception that shields dangerous chemicals from> scrutiny is the result of the intimidation tactics sometimes used against> experts who go public about health hazards.”A prime example of this strategy are the actions taken by the chemical industryto discredit Rachel Carson after the publication of Silent Spring. In GreenBacklash, Andrew Rowell quotes extracts from his interview with John Stauber,the founder of the Center for Media and Democracy and co-author of Trust Us,We’re Experts. In the interview, John Stauber describes one of the disgracefultactics used against Rachel Carson’s work,> “The National Agricultural Association doubled its PR budget and distributed> thousands of book reviews trashing Silent Spring.”Mark Purdey, who revealed the real cause of BSE and stated that it resulted froma toxic organophosphate ‘wash’ used to protect cattle from warble flies, wasalso subjected to abusive campaigns to discredit him and his work; in theForeword to Animal Pharm, his brother writes that,> “Those who criticised the official orthodoxy were cruelly derided and> dismissed as being ‘unscientific’ and lacking in objectivity.”Mark Purdey also explains that,> “Despite publication in a variety of scientific journals, the authorities and> their key advisors are ignoring these findings and are doing their utmost to> marginalise those of us who are trying to pursue this line of research.”Those with a vested interest in preventing certain information from reaching thepublic will use a variety of tactics against any form of opposition to their‘consensus’ view, even if this involves a government department; as demonstratedby the chemical industry’s fight against the EPA after the Dioxin Reassessmentreport was published in 1994. Joe Thornton writes in Pandora’s Poison that thefight by the industry was to,> “...aggressively defend the industry’s credibility through the use of third> party sources ...ostensibly to debunk what they referred to as ‘EPA’s> misleading claims’.”In this instance, EPA’s claims were not misleading; dioxins are recognised to besome of the most toxic substances known to science. Yet, despite thisrecognition, the chemical industry denied that dioxins are extremely hazardousbecause it was incompatible with their ‘interests’. The toxicity of dioxins isno longer disputed.It is clear therefore, that PR campaigns are often used to discredit the work ofthose who dare to challenge the ‘consensus’ view in almost any field; but theinclusion of deceptive information in those PR campaigns indicates that theyare, in reality, propaganda campaigns that intentionally misinform the publicabout issues that increasingly affect the lives and health of everyone,everywhere.Philanthropy, Charity & The Third SectorSociety is said to be comprised of three ‘sectors’, the first of which is theprivate or business sector and the second is the public or government sector.The third sector, also referred to as ‘civil society’, is comprised ofnon-profit, non-governmental organisations, the main function of which is to‘help people in need’, in other words, to performs acts of charity andphilanthropy.It is claimed that charity and philanthropy are different; the former is said tobe reactive and short-term and the latter proactive and long-term, although inpractice these differences are not always apparent. A more significantdifference relates to their sources of finance; philanthropy is funded mainly bywealthy individuals, families and corporations, often through foundations,whereas charity is funded mainly by the general public.According to the page entitled Recent charity register statistics: CharityCommission, in 2018 there were 167,972 charities in the UK that had a combinedannual income of £76 billion. The income of individual charities, however,varies widely; at one extreme, 65,448 are reported to have had an income of£10,000 or less, whereas at the other extreme, 2,251 are reported to have had anincome of £5 million or more.The situation in the US is reported in two articles; the first is a March 2010article entitled Number of Charities and Foundations Passes 1.2 Million. Thesecond is a June 2018 press release entitled Giving USA 2018: Americans Gave$410.02 Billion to Charity in 2017, Crossing the $400 Billion Mark for the FirstTime. The titles are self-explanatory.It is clear that non-profit organisations are collectively able to raise hugesums of money for a large number and wide variety of ‘good causes’. But it isequally clear that certain causes are far better funded than others; a situationfor which there are a number of explanations, not least of which is that somecauses, such as cancer for example, receive a great deal of publicity. Otherexplanations are less obvious but significant, one of which is that theincreasingly close cooperation between organisations within all three sectors ofsociety enables ‘vested interests’ to promote the ‘causes’ that best serve theirinterests.The expansion of civil society has led to the formation of various organisationsfor the purposes of managing and assisting third sector organisations, such asthe Charities Aid Foundation (CAF) for example. CAF, a UK-based non-profitorganisation that operates ‘globally’, claims, on the page entitled What We Do,to ‘help donors’ and states that,> “We do this by working globally to increase the flow of funds to the charity> and non-profit sectors through the provision of philanthropy products and> services, whilst providing fundraising solutions and support for charities> internationally.”One of the organisations that manage internet-based charitable donations is JustGiving, which is described on the website as,> “…the world’s most trusted platform for online giving.”On the About Us web page is the statement that,> “We are enormously proud to have helped people in 164 countries raise over> $4.5 billion for good causes since we were founded in 2001.”Another organisation that ‘manages’ charitable donations is the UK-basedCharities Trust, which is described on the website as,> “…a leading donations management organisation committed to growing charitable> giving since 1987.”One of the ways in which ‘charitable giving’ has increased in recent years isthrough donations via employers’ schemes, as indicated by an August 2018 articleentitled New global partnership to boost employee giving in the UK on theCharities Trust website. This article refers to a new partnership betweenCharities Trust and YourCause; the latter is described as,> “…the US-based leader in enterprise philanthropic technology…”The purpose of this partnership is to enable businesses to set up ‘schemes’ toincrease charitable donations, including schemes whereby employees can donate tocharities through the payroll. Business-led schemes of this nature are claimedto be part of ‘corporate social responsibility’ (CSR), a term that refers to avariety of corporate responsibilities that include their obligations to societyas well as to shareholders. CSR also involves ‘sustainable practices’; whichmeans that corporations are increasingly obliged to follow the 2030 Agenda,especially SDGs 8 and 9. The aim of SDG 8 is to,> “Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and> productive employment and decent work for all.”The aim of SDG 9 is to,> “Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable> industrialization and foster innovation.”As previously discussed, the mission of IMPACT2030 is to increase financialsupport for the 2030 Agenda goals through ‘volunteer employee programmes’; asindicated by the web page entitled Employees Teach the Global Goals, whichrefers to,> “Mobilizing employee volunteers to educate and inspire millions of young> students around the world about the Global Goals.”In addition to educating and inspiring people, these organisations also seek toraise money through organisations such as YourCause, which promotes IMPACT2030and provides a platform for organisations to support the SDGs of their choice;as indicated by the page entitled The Global Goals Gateway which states that,> “Our first step in promoting IMPACT2030 to our partners is a tool for> nonprofits called The Global Goals Gateway.”SDG Watch Europe is another organisation that is fully supportive of the 2030Agenda; it describes itself as an alliance of civil society organisations whosegoal, according to the website is,> “…to hold governments to account for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda…”A leaflet produced by SDG Watch states that,> “Civil society plays an essential role in pointing out the contradictions> between goals and in advocating for the full participation of civil society in> all Agenda 2030 implementation and monitoring mechanisms.”Another organisation that promotes the 2030 Agenda, but is mainly aimed at youngpeople, is SDSN (Sustainable Development Solutions Network) Youth, which,according to the website, aims to ‘educate’ young people about the SDGs and,> “…provides opportunities for them to pioneer innovative solutions to address> the world’s biggest challenges.”The ‘education’ provided to these young people will inevitably include erroneousideas about ‘climate change’ and ‘infectious disease’, to name just two, as wellas the inappropriate solutions claimed to be able to address these problems.Another organisation that is fully supportive of the 2030 Agenda is the UNFoundation, which, despite its title, was not created by the UN, but bybillionaire Ted Turner, who, in 1997, donated an initial ‘gift’ of 1 billion USdollars. On the web page entitled What We Do is the statement that,> “We are an advocate for the United Nations and a platform for connecting> people, ideas and resources to help the UN solve global problems.”It is clear that there is a concerted effort by many ‘interested parties’ topromote the 2030 Agenda goals through charitable and philanthropic organisationsin order to increase public awareness and enlist their support.One of the world’s biggest challenges is poverty, the topic of SDG 1 and a‘cause’ that has received a huge level of support from the campaigns of manycivil society organisations. The anti-poverty campaign known as Make PovertyHistory was launched in 2005 in the UK, but developed into a worldwidephenomenon. A May 2013 Oxfam press release entitled Make Poverty History, and G8promises – was it worth it? states that this campaign became,> “…a worldwide alliance of anti-poverty organisations and individuals from over> 70 countries organised under the umbrella of the ‘Global Call to Action> against Poverty’.”This worldwide alliance is described on the GCAP (Global Call to Action againstPoverty) website as,> “…the world’s largest civil society movement calling for an end to poverty and> inequality.”On the website is a 2018 statement signed by GCAP that urges action on the SDGs;this statement claims that little progress has been made since the 2030 Agendawas adopted and that the world remains ‘unequal’, despite the aim of SDG 10 to,> “Reduce inequality within and among countries.”It would seem that the response to the question raised by the above cited Oxfampress release must be an emphatic ‘no’; poverty has not been ‘made history’.Instead, it has continued to worsen, as demonstrated by the 2017 and 2018 Oxfamreports cited earlier in this chapter.One of the main reasons that the anti-poverty movement has failed to eradicatepoverty is because it has failed to tackle the underlying causes of poverty,which are the result of a variety of factors, including the economic policies ofthe IMF and World Bank.War on Want (WoW), a UK-based organisation that also claims to be ‘fightingglobal poverty’, states on the website that they are different from othercharities and justifies this claim on the page entitled What We Do, which statesthat,> “We believe poverty is caused by the political choices made by powerful> elites: governments, wealthy corporations and others.”It would seem that WoW recognises some of the key problems; as indicated by thestatement on the same page, under the heading Economic justice and corporateaccountability, that,> “War on Want actively opposes trade deals and practices that promote the> domination of markets over people’s livelihoods, welfare and rights.”The web page also identifies some of the other problems, such as those caused bycorporate ownership and exploitation of land and resources and by the corporateownership and control of food and agriculture. These are some of the underlyingcauses of the problems that were also identified by Professor Chossudovsky anddescribed in The Globalization of Poverty, as previously discussed in chaptereight.The solution to ‘poverty’ cannot involve a continuation of the existingprogrammes, because none of them has been able to make any significant impact toreduce the scale of the problem. It is clear therefore that a different approachis required; an approach that correctly identifies and removes the causes of theproblem. Oscar Wilde suggests in his book The Soul of Man Under Socialism that,> “The proper aim is to try and reconstruct society on such a basis that poverty> will be impossible.”The purpose of citing this quote is not to advocate ‘socialism’, as that is notthe solution. Instead, its purpose is to highlight that the only approach thatwill succeed in eradicating poverty is one that will remove its causes, so thatpoverty will cease to exist. Most of the causes of existing poverty owe theirorigin to the manner in which society, especially the ‘money system’, has beenconstructed and continues to operate, which is largely under the control of‘vested interests’ that do not operate for the benefit of ‘the people’.Another of the world’s biggest challenges is ‘health’, or more correctly‘ill-health’, for which a large number of charities have been established toraise funds for increased research into a specific disease or type of disease.Public support for these charities is all too often generated by raising fear inpeople’s minds with claims that anyone can be affected by the disease inquestion; Dr Carolyn Dean explains in Death by Modern Medicine that,> “Each charity would first build on the fear of getting their dread disease and> convince people that money was the cure.”One of the most feared diseases is cancer, for which there are several charitiesthat raise funds for research to find the ‘cure’. Cancer Research UK, which wasoriginally founded in 1902 as the Imperial Cancer Research fund, makes the claimon their website that,> “Together we will beat cancer.”This claim is misleading; like virtually all other cancer charities, CancerResearch UK supports the traditional ‘treatments’ for cancer, which includesurgery, chemotherapy, radiation, hormone therapy, targeted drug therapy andimmunotherapy, amongst others. The problems with these ‘treatments’ have beendiscussed; the main reason they are unsuitable is because they do not addressthe real causes of cancer.The web page entitled Causes of cancer and reducing your risk claims that 4 in10 of UK cancer cases ‘can be prevented’, and that the ‘risk’ of cancer dependson genes, as well as environmental and lifestyle factors that can be controlled.The page does, however, recognise that one of the controllable lifestyle factorsthat play a role in cancer is a ‘healthy diet’; the web page entitled Diet andcancer states that,> “A healthy balanced diet with plenty of fibre, fruit and vegetables and less> red and processed meat and salt can help cut cancer risk.”Although not incorrect, this information is inadequate. Unfortunately, thischarity also promulgates erroneous information; such as the page entitled Foodcontroversies, which states, under the heading Pesticides and organic foods,that,> “High doses of some pesticides can cause cancer in animals, but the levels> found in foods are tightly regulated to make sure they are well below this> dose.”The page makes the further claim that,> “There is also evidence that eating organic food – which usually doesn’t use> pesticides – doesn’t affect cancer risk.”Further claims are made on the page entitled Cancer controversies, one of whichrelates to personal care products about which the page states that,> “…there is no good scientific evidence to show that these products affect the> risk of cancer.”These claims about diet, pesticides, organic foods and personal care productsare erroneous, as demonstrated by the discussions throughout this book.Dr Samuel Epstein spent decades exposing the flawed nature of the informationpromulgated by the ‘cancer establishment’; he states in Toxic Beauty that,> “The cancer establishments worldwide still rely on questionable data and> biased claims from publicly funded institutional apologists for the status quo> and academics working for the very industries they should be exposing.”The ACS page entitled Does This Cause Cancer? makes the interesting statementthat,> “Some people might be surprised to learn that there’s no single, comprehensive> list of all chemicals that cause cancer.”It is shocking rather than merely surprising that no single organisationmaintains a comprehensive and regularly updated database of all substances shownto be potentially, if not actually carcinogenic. This is even more shockingconsidering that the WHO has predicted that the incidence of cancer willcontinue to rise into the foreseeable future. Part of the reason for thissituation is because the vast majority of chemicals remain untested; a fact thatis acknowledged by the ACS in the statement that,> “…it’s not possible to study the millions of chemicals (natural and man-made)> people can be exposed to.”The justification for the failure to study all chemicals is that,> “It would simply be too expensive, would take too long, and in many cases, it> wouldn’t be necessary.”The question that ought to be raised is whose interests these cancerorganisations represent; a question that Dr Epstein addresses in Toxic Beauty inhis statement that,> “The US cancer establishment’s professional mindset and politically misshapen> priorities are compounded by disturbing conflicts of interest, particularly> for the ACS, because of its relationship with the cancer drug industry, as> well as with the petrochemical and other polluting industries...”Dr Epstein maintains that most cancers are preventable and that the war againstcancer is winnable, but reveals the influence of ‘vested interests’ in thestatement that,> “The worldwide cancer establishments share major responsibility for losing the> winnable war against cancer, a fact that is all the more serious in view of> the strong influence that US cancer establishment policies continue to exert> on other nations worldwide.”He also reveals that the NCI, the US cancer research agency, has spent more than$50 billion since the ‘War on Cancer’ was declared in 1971, but that,> “...less than 2 percent of its budget has gone to cancer prevention.”The discussion in chapter seven revealed that cancer does not need to be‘fought’; it does not require a war to defeat the disease, but it does requirean understanding of the real causes.The Cancer Research UK web page about ‘cancer controversies’ also refers toMobile phones, wifi and power lines; in other words, non-ionising radiation.Although the page acknowledges that the IARC classified mobile phones as Group2B, in other words, as ‘possibly’ carcinogenic to humans, it also claims that,> “…the scientific evidence shows it is unlikely that mobile phones could> increase the risk of brain tumours…”Nothing could be further from the truth.The discussions in chapters six and seven demonstrate that there is an abundanceof evidence that shows a statistically significant increased risk of developingbrain tumours due to mobile phones, especially when they are held in very closeproximity to the head for extended periods of time. These risks are shown to beeven greater for young children whose heads are still growing.The page also claims that evidence shows that wi-fi and smart meters do not posea risk to health; this too is erroneous. Chapter six revealed the existence of alarge and growing body of evidence that demonstrates the adverse health effects,including cancers, due to exposures to non-ionising radiation. The imminentintroduction of millimetre waves to facilitate 5G and SMART technologies willonly exacerbate the problem, unless the public is made aware that this willendanger the health of everyone, everywhere and takes action to halt itsimplementation.Although foundations are established ostensibly for philanthropic purposes, someof the activities for which they have been, and in some cases still are usedcannot be described as being for the benefit of ‘people in need’. The funding ofresearch into ‘fertility reduction’ as a method of reducing the growing worldpopulation by the Rockefeller Foundation has been discussed. However, researchof this nature is ongoing and would seem to receive support from other‘philanthropists’, most notably, Bill Gates. At a TED2010 conference, Bill Gatespresented a talk entitled Innovating to Zero, in which he discussed ideas toreduce manmade CO2 emissions to zero. He also referred to continuing populationgrowth and claimed that the world population would soon reach 9 billion. In hisMarch 2010 article entitled Bill Gates talks about ‘vaccines to reducepopulation’, William Engdahl reports that in this talk, Bill Gates refers to thesize of the population and states that,> “Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive> services, we lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.”Although he does not refer to vaccines as the sole method by which the worldpopulation can be reduced, he clearly considers it to be one of the approaches.However, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) is well-known for itsextraordinary efforts to deliver vaccines to all children, especially in‘developing’ countries and particularly in countries within Africa. In hisarticle, William Engdahl also reports that, in 2010, Bill Gates,> “…announced his foundation would give $10 billion (circa €7.5 billion) over> the next decade to develop and deliver new vaccines in the developing world.”The BMGF is involved in many vaccine-promoting organisations, one of which isGAVI, which, on a web page entitled Working together for healthy vaccinemarkets, emphasises the commercial rather than the ‘philanthropic’ aspect of themarket. Nevertheless, the page also promotes the standard establishment viewthat vaccines are essential in the statement that,> “A proactive effort to make vaccine markets work better for lower-income> countries is essential to reach all children with life-saving vaccines...”Although this statement may be interpreted as simply PR, in reality, it shouldbe seen as propaganda; vaccines are not ‘life-saving’. The claim that they savelives is refuted by the many thousands of people, and especially children, whohave been damaged by them and by the huge sums of money that have been paid byvaccine damage compensation funds. It is interesting, but unsurprising, thatUHC2030, the movement to accelerate access to Universal Health Care and to‘medicines and vaccines’ is funded by a number of ‘global partners’ thatinclude: UNAIDS, the World Bank, GAVI Alliance and the Global Fund to Fight AIDSTB & Malaria, as well as the Rockefeller Foundation and the Bill and MelindaGates Foundation.Another of the world’s major issues is hunger, which is perceived to be causedby an inadequate production of food. Although this claim has been shown to beerroneous, philanthropic organisations have also become involved in efforts tointroduce ‘industrial agriculture’, especially into Africa through AGRA. BMGF isone of the funders of AGRA that continues its efforts to introduce the ‘GreenRevolution’ into African countries, despite the strong resistance of manyAfrican people who are perfectly aware of the hazards with which this method isassociated.Another organisation involved with efforts to introduce ‘industrial agriculture’around the world is CGIAR (Consultative Groups on International AgriculturalResearch), which states on the website that,> “Towards a world free of poverty, hunger and environmental degradation, CGIAR> is the world’s largest global agricultural innovations network.”CGIAR is certainly a large organisation; it claims to have a research fund ofalmost a billion dollars. However, although the stated objective sounds highly‘philanthropic’, the organisations that provide the funds reveal a verydifferent underlying objective. In addition to the BMGF, the list of CGIARfunders includes: USAID, World Bank Group, the Rockefeller Foundation, FAO, OPEC(Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries), UNDP and Syngenta Foundation,to name just a few. It is clear that CGIAR supports the 2030 Agenda; asindicated by the web page entitled Health, on which it is stated that more than800 million people are chronically undernourished, but that,> “CGIAR research to improve nutrition and health contributes strongly to the> United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals and targets for the 2030> agenda…”Syngenta, another funder of CGIAR, is a global agribusiness company based inSwitzerland that produces agrichemicals and GM crops. On the web page entitledWho We Are is the claim that,> “Our business – and the world’s food security – depend on sustainable natural> resources, healthy ecosystems and thriving rural communities.”The discussions in chapters six and eight demonstrate that the consequences ofagribusiness practices are detrimental to the ecosystem, as well as unhealthyand unsustainable. Yet Syngenta supports the 2030 Agenda, which claims to beable to solve hunger and illness; this further substantiates the assertion thatthe underlying purpose of the ‘agenda’ is not to make the world a better placefor everyone, everywhere, but only to make it better for ‘vested interests’.It is clearly of the utmost importance that people become aware that asignificant proportion of the ‘information’ they receive about the ‘good causes’they are encouraged to support, especially those related to the 2030 Agenda, is,in reality, little more than PR and propaganda.The MediaThe website of ‘Oxford Dictionaries’ defines the term ‘media’ as,> “The main means of mass communication (broadcasting, publishing and the> Internet) regarded collectively.”The conventional view of ‘the media’ is that the information, or news, theyprovide is factual because the sources are deemed to be trustworthy; asindicated by the previously cited ACS page entitled Does This Cause Cancer,which claims that,> “Major news sources generally try to provide accurate, unbiased information.”This view is, however, grossly misleading.The media sources deemed to be ‘trustworthy’, often referred to as themainstream media (MSM), have been shown to be increasingly responsible forreporting inaccurate and biased information. The main reason for this is due tothe influence of ‘vested interests’ that own or otherwise control the majormedia corporations; their ownership enables them to ensure that the informationpromulgated to the public as ‘news’ conforms to their ‘agenda’.Although it is commonly believed that the journalists who report the ‘news’ haveconducted a full investigation of the ‘stories’ about which they write, this isnow rarely the case; in his 2008 book entitled Flat Earth News, Nick Daviesrefers to,> “...journalists who are no longer out gathering news but who are reduced> instead to passive processors of whatever material comes their way, churning> out stories, whether real event or PR artifice, important or trivial, true or> false.”He explains that a substantial proportion of the ‘material’ made available tojournalists is sourced from newswires or PR agencies, and that journalists nolonger have any time to investigate this material in any depth to determinewhether it is ‘real’ or merely PR. As previously discussed, information providedby a PR agency in the form of a press release will be biased by intention. It istherefore possible for a press release promoting an ‘agenda’ to be mistaken fora news story containing genuine information. The comment by Nick Davies that‘news stories’ may not even be true is corroborated by Professor Chossudovskywho asserts in The Globalization of Poverty that,> “The global media fabricates the news and overtly distorts the course of world> events.”Although ‘vested interests’ are able to influence a significant proportion ofthe information available on the internet, mainly through their influence oversocial media websites and the most commonly used ‘search engine’, they do notactually control the internet.However, although the internet remains a valuable resource and a source ofgenuine information, people who wish to utilise this resource for the study of aparticular subject must be aware that it is also a source of misinformation anddisinformation. The internet is increasingly used to vilify anyone whochallenges the ‘consensus’ view and to discredit them and their work with theuse of derogatory labels; for example, anyone who challenges the consensus viewon ‘climate change’ is likely to be labelled a ‘climate change denier’, a‘conspiracy theorist’ or possibly worse.The fact that the internet remains a source of information that challenges theestablishment narrative and exposes the deceptions promulgated by the mainstreammedia, poses a threat to ‘vested interests’, whose determination to retaincontrol of the narrative on virtually all topics has led to the implementationof different strategies designed to combat this threat. One of these strategieshas been to employ the phrase ‘fake news’ and apply it to all information thatdoes not conform to the ‘mainstream narrative’; it is most commonly applied tonon-mainstream media sources, usually referred to as the ‘alternative media’.Although some ‘alternative media’ sources provide accurate and unbiasedinformation, others do not; some even promulgate disinformation. Moreimportantly, however, some sources have been found to disseminate a mixture ofgenuine and misleading information, all of which makes internet researchextremely complex and fraught with many difficulties.The strategy of applying the label ‘fake news’ to any and all information thatchallenges the ‘establishment narrative’ promulgated by the MSM, can bedemonstrated by the initiation of an enquiry into ‘fake news’ by the UKgovernment; as indicated by the January 2017 web page entitled ‘Fake news’inquiry launched that states,> “The Culture, Media and Sport Committee launches an inquiry into ‘fake news’:> the growing phenomenon of widespread dissemination, through social media and> the internet, and acceptance as fact stories of uncertain provenance or> accuracy.”The interim report produced by this enquiry recommends the use of ‘factchecking’ organisations, of which there is an increasing number. However, thisraises the question of who is to be responsible for determining what are the‘facts’. One ‘fact checking’ organisation is called Full Fact, which isdescribed on the website as,> “…the UK’s independent factchecking charity.”The website claims that, not only is Full Fact independent, it is also neutraland does not support any view; the objective of Full Fact is stated to be,> “…to make sure that there are systems in place so that only valid and> validated claims are put into the public domain…”It should be noted, however, that one of the funders of Full Fact is the OpenSociety Foundations (OSF), the creation of billionaire George Soros. On the OSFwebsite is a page entitled Access to Medicines that states,> “The Open Society Foundations support efforts to increase access to essential> medicines for people in low-resource countries, especially for poor and> marginalized populations.”It is therefore extremely unlikely that OSF would permit Full Fact toacknowledge that medicines are harmful and to recognise the previously citedJuly 2000 article by Dr Barbara Starfield, in which she revealed statisticsabout the adverse health events due to correctly prescribed medicines. Herfindings were recognised to have been ‘valid and validated’ and fully supportedby scientific evidence; yet they remain unknown to the vast majority of thegeneral public.However, OSF is not the only influence over Full Fact; one of the main sourcesof their information is Public Health England (PHE), which, as a department ofthe UK government, inevitably adheres to the ‘medical establishment’ narrativeon topics relating to ‘medicines’; which means that it is extremely unlikelythat Full Fact would expose the true extent of the hazards of pharmaceuticals.It is clear that ‘fact checking’ organisations provide opportunities for themainstream narrative on a particular topic to be asserted as representing‘truth’, even though ample evidence exists to refute that claim and prove thenarrative to be deceptive. Although most MSM journalists no longer conductin-depth investigations, it does not necessarily require a great deal of effortto discover information that refutes the false nature of certain ‘news stories’;as the following three examples will demonstrate.The first example relates to ‘news stories’ about measles, which, untilrelatively recently, was considered to be a mild illness, but is now reported tobe highly contagious and potentially fatal; as indicated by the May 2019 WHOMeasles fact sheet that states,> “Even though a safe and cost effective vaccine is available, in 2017 there> were 110,000 measles deaths globally…”This claim is misleading; these deaths are not directly attributable to measlesbut to ‘complications’, as the fact sheet acknowledges,> “Most measles-related deaths are caused by complications associated with the> disease.”Interestingly, however, the fact sheet claims that,> “Severe complications from measles can be reduced through supportive care that> ensures good nutrition, adequate fluid intake and treatment of dehydration…”The complications of measles are admitted to be mainly suffered by ‘poorlynourished’ young children in ‘developing’ countries. Nevertheless, the factsheet insists that measles is caused by a ‘virus’ and asserts that,> “The virus remains active and contagious in the air or on infected surfaces> for up to 2 hours.”It would seem that the WHO has failed to consult standard microbiology textbooksthat do not describe viruses as ‘alive’, but invariably refer to them as being‘inert outside the host cell’; the word ‘inert’ is defined on the OxfordDictionaries website as,> “Lacking the ability or strength to move. Chemically inactive.”Despite the fact that some microbiology textbooks can be accessed and readonline for free, few, if any, journalists have utilised these valuable resourcesto investigate the real nature of viruses and discover that they are not ‘livingorganisms’ and are inert outside of a cell; which means that they cannot ‘remainactive’ either in the air or on any surface. Unfortunately, journalistsinvariably write reports that conform to the consensus view that ‘viruses’ aredangerous pathogens that ‘infect’ people and cause ‘disease’. A pertinentexample is an August 2018 article entitled Measles cases hit record high inEurope, which states that,> “More than 41,000 have been infected in the first six months of 2018, leading> to 37 deaths.”This article was sourced from the WHO news release entitled Measles cases hitrecord high in the European Region that states,> “To prevent outbreaks, at least 95% immunization coverage with 2 doses of> measles-containing vaccine is needed every year in every community…”However, the author of the 2018 article ought to have contrasted this WHOrelease with a 1987 article entitled Measles outbreak in a vaccinated schoolpopulation: epidemiology, chains of transmission and the role of vaccinefailures. This peer-reviewed article, which was published in the AmericanJournal of Public Health, states that,> “An outbreak of measles occurred in a high school with a documented> vaccination level of 98 per cent.”The article also states that 70 per cent of the measles cases occurred invaccinated students and are therefore to be regarded as ‘vaccine failures’, theexistence of which challenges the claim that vaccines are effective.Nevertheless, the website of the UK NHS promotes the idea that vaccines preventmeasles, which is,> “…now uncommon in the UK because of the effectiveness of vaccination.”Yet a June 2018 article entitled Measles outbreak in Bristol prompts publichealth warning, reports that,> “People shunning vaccination is part of the problem, say experts.”The article also made the statement that,> “Although research published 20 years ago about a possible link between the> MMR vaccine and autism has been discredited, the scare it created damaged some> people’s trust of the vaccine.”This is clearly a reference to the work of Dr Andrew Wakefield that is claimedto have been ‘discredited’; but it fails to explain the contradiction betweenthe NHS claim that measles is uncommon due to vaccination and the claim ofunnamed ‘experts’ that people have shunned the vaccination.However, conspicuous by its absence is any reference to the work of Dr StefanLanka who established in a court of law in Germany that the scientific papersclaimed to demonstrate the existence of a ‘measles virus’ do no such thing;there is no definitive evidence that ‘measles’ is caused by a ‘virus’, aspreviously discussed. The real cause of the ill-health referred to as ‘measles’is explained by Dr John Tilden in a statement previously cited in chapter fourthat bears repetition,> “Measles is the manner in which a child’s body throws off toxemia.”The second example relates to ‘news stories’ about ‘Ebola’, which the May 2019WHO fact sheet entitled Ebola virus disease refers to as,> “…a rare but severe, often fatal illness in humans.”It is claimed that this ‘disease’ has a case fatality rate that varies between25 and 90 per cent, but is, on average, approximately 50 per cent; it istherefore an extremely serious health problem. The fact sheet states that,> “It is thought that fruit bats of the Pteropodidae family are natural Ebola> virus hosts.”The phrase ‘it is thought’ indicates that these bats have not been proven to bethe ‘natural’ hosts of the so-called ‘virus’. The fact sheet reports that thefirst signs of ‘Ebola’ include common symptoms such as fever, headache andmuscle pain; but later symptoms are more significant and are reported to includevomiting and diarrhoea as well as,> “…symptoms of impaired kidney and liver function…”In early 2018, an outbreak of Ebola was reported to have occurred in theDemocratic Republic of Congo (DRC). One of the efforts by the WHO and others tocontain this ‘outbreak’ involved the administration of a newly developedvaccine, as indicated by a May 2018 GAVI article entitled Ebola vaccine to helptackle DRC outbreak, which referred to ‘vaccination teams’ in the area toadminister the vaccine to those considered to be ‘at risk’. This vaccine wasvery quickly reported to have been successful; as indicated by a July 2018 GAVIarticle entitled Ebola vaccine praised as Congo outbreak declared over, whichstates that,> “A total of 3,300 people received investigational doses of the vaccine as part> of a ring vaccination protocol…”The outbreak was declared to be ‘over’ when no new cases had been reported for a42-day period. However, praise for the vaccine was premature because, asreported by a WHO Ebola situation report, on 1st August 2018 the Minister ofHealth for the DRC announced a new ‘outbreak’; a situation that led to anexpansion of the vaccination programme.It is clear from the symptoms that the causes of the condition referred to as‘Ebola virus disease’ involve toxins of some description. Unfortunately, thefocus of health organisations, especially the WHO, on an alleged viral causemeans that no toxicological tests are likely to have been conducted to determinethe real causes of this serious condition; however, there are some clues topotential candidates. The Democratic Republic of Congo is known to be a countrythat has significant quantities of valuable minerals, not least of which arecobalt, copper, diamond, tantalum, tin and gold. It is widely reported that manyinternational mining companies operate in the DRC including in North Kivu, theregion in which the August 2018 ‘outbreak’ occurred. Previous discussions haveindicated that mining is a particularly hazardous occupation; but ill-healthcaused by exposures to and inhalation of various substances during mining rarelyfeatures in any reports by the MSM.The third and final example to be discussed relates to ‘news stories’ about Lymedisease, for which there is no WHO fact sheet. A CDC web page entitled LymeDisease states that,> “Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi and is> transmitted to humans through the bite of infected blacklegged ticks.”Like mosquitoes, newly emerged ticks are said to be uninfected, but can become‘infected’ through the ingestion of bacteria if they bite an ‘infected’ animal.The web page claims that fever, headache and fatigue, as well as a distinctiverash, are the most common symptoms associated with Lyme disease, but other, moreserious symptoms can develop in the absence of treatment; the page states that,> “If left untreated, infection can spread to joints, the heart and the nervous> system.”The recommended treatments for Lyme disease are antibiotics, of which the mostcommonly used are doxycycline, amoxicillin, and cefuroxime, all of which areintentionally toxic, as their purpose is to kill bacteria. In common with allpharmaceuticals, these antibiotics produce ‘effects’, some of which are similarto the symptoms associated with the disease, such as fever and headache. Other‘effects’ of these antibiotics are vomiting and diarrhoea, both of which areindicative of the body’s efforts to eliminate ‘poisons’, including the toxic‘medicines’.The belief that Lyme disease is caused by bacteria has prevented investigationof any potential toxicological causes; however, again there are some clues as topotential candidates. One of the likely causal factors are insect repellents,especially those produced from synthetic pyrethroid compounds. Whilst permethrinis commonly used as an insect-repellent treatment for clothing, bifenthrin iscommonly used as an outdoor spray for gardens. Interestingly, insect repellentshave been shown not to be an effective method of reducing the incidence of Lymedisease. An August 2013 article entitled CDC Study Finds Pesticide Ineffectiveat Stopping the Spread of Lyme Disease, published on the website of BeyondPesticides, refers to the study and states that,> “…spraying lawns with the insecticide bifenthrin does not reduce the incidence> of tick-borne diseases.”According to the NPIC (National Pesticide Information Center), both permethrinand bifenthrin interfere with the insects’ nervous system; but these syntheticpyrethroids are also neurotoxic to humans. The claim that ‘untreated’ Lymedisease can affect the nervous system, raises the question of whether thosepeople whose nervous system has been affected had been exposed to apyrethroid-based insect-repellent, or to some other neurotoxic substance.It is clear from these three examples that the public is not only ill-informed,but often misinformed about many topics, especially those that relate to healthmatters. Although many non-mainstream media sources challenge the mainstreamview on a wide variety of topics, very few, if any of them challenge thetheories about the causes of ‘disease’ that have been shown throughout this bookto be fundamentally flawed.It would seem appropriate to close this chapter with the saying attributed toMahatma Gandhi that was quoted at the beginning of chapter two,> “An error does not become truth by reason of multiplied propagation, nor does> truth become error because nobody sees it.”"},{"pageContent":"> 10. The Real Nature and Causes of Illness> “The belief in diseases and cures stands as an effective barrier to a true> education in healthful living.” Herbert Shelton Modern medicine is based on the core assertion that impaired health can beremedied through the use of medicines that fight diseases and vaccines thatprevent them. Furthermore, modern medicine is claimed to be the only healthcaresystem capable of defeating and preventing disease because it is the only onethat is firmly grounded in evidence-based science.However, as demonstrated by the discussions throughout this book, and especiallyin this final chapter, nothing could be further from the truth.It is generally claimed that modern medicine emerged as the result of scientificadvances made during the 17th and 18th centuries, although it was not until thelate 19th century that some of the most significant medical ‘breakthroughs’occurred. The most important of these include: the identification of differentbacteria, the formulation of the ‘germ theory’ and the development and use of anumber of vaccines.The pace at which modern medicine progressed began to accelerate through theearly decades of the 20th century, mainly as the result of technologicalinnovations. The invention of the electron microscope in the 1930s, for example,enabled scientists to view smaller structures than had previously been possible,which led them to discover the particles that became known as ‘viruses’. Thedevelopment of advanced technologies progressed at an increasingly faster paceduring the latter part of the 20th century and has continued to do so into theearly 21st century. These technologies have been utilised by modern medicine andhave facilitated the development of increasingly sophisticated medical devicesand equipment for purposes such as diagnostics, treatments and laboratory-basedresearch.Yet modern medicine can only boast a single victory over diseases that affecthumans, namely, the eradication of smallpox; but, as previously discussed, thisis an invalid boast. It is clear therefore, that, despite the passage of morethan two centuries and the expenditure of unimaginably huge sums of money, thesuccessful defeat of ‘human disease’ remains elusive to the medicalestablishment.Although claimed to be thoroughly scientific, modern medicine adopted anapproach towards disease and its treatment that was based on two long-heldbeliefs that substantially predate the era of modern science. One of thesebeliefs claims that each disease is a distinct entity that attacks the humanbody; the other claims that each disease can be defeated through the use of theappropriate medicine. The acceptance of the ‘germ theory’ led to the adoption ofa third belief, which claims that diseases caused by ‘germs’ can be prevented byvaccines. These beliefs are, however, fundamentally flawed; they do notaccurately represent the nature of disease or the means by which diseases shouldbe treated or can be prevented. The failure of modern medicine to defeat diseaseis entirely attributable to the rigid adherence to these flawed beliefs.Unfortunately, virtually all forms of ‘healthcare’ operate from the basis of thesame flawed theories about the nature of disease. The reason for the focus on‘modern medicine’, or the medical establishment as it is referred to in thisbook, is because it is the healthcare system that is to be implemented by allWHO Member States in order to achieve the aims of the 2030 Agenda, which includethe introduction of universal health coverage and increased access to ‘medicinesand vaccines for all’. It is therefore imperative to expose the erroneous natureof the theories that underpin the practices of this healthcare system; suchexposure is a core purpose of this book.It is important to reiterate that the failings of the medical establishmentsystem, as described throughout this book, refer solely to the approach to‘disease’, they do not apply to emergency procedures or the use of surgicaloperations for physical injuries. Herbert Shelton explains this distinction inthe statement that,> “Only those materials and influences which are useful in the preservation of> health are useful in the restoration of health. To this principle Hygienists> make but one exception: namely, constructive surgery, as employed in wounds,> broken bones, accidents, dislocations, etc.”All quotes by Herbert Shelton included in this chapter are from his bookentitled Natural Hygiene: Man’s Pristine Way of Life, unless otherwise stated.It should be noted that the materials used by the medical establishment for thetreatment and prevention of disease are not conducive to the preservation orrestoration of health. All medicines and vaccines produced by the pharmaceuticalindustry are acknowledged to induce unintended effects in addition to theirintended effects. But these additional effects are usually referred to as ‘sideeffects’ as if they are of little importance, but this is grossly misleading.Although unintended, these effects are, in reality, direct effects; theiroccurrence after the administration of a medicine or vaccine provides clearconfirmation that these products are inimical to health, not supportive of it.Evidence of the harm they can cause is also confirmed by the phenomenon known asiatrogenesis, the incidence of which continues to rise.It may be argued that the occurrence of adverse effects after the administrationof a medicine or vaccine may indicate a correlation but should not beinterpreted as evidence of causation. This argument is, however unjustified andunjustifiable; it can be refuted by the counter argument that all pharmaceuticalmedicines and vaccines are acknowledged to produce ‘side effects’; they aretherefore the direct causes of these effects. Furthermore, the majority of thechemical ingredients of pharmaceuticals, both medicines and vaccines, areinherently toxic to the human body. Many medicines are intentionally toxic; forexample, the purpose of antibiotics and antivirals is to kill ‘germs’ and thepurpose of cancer treatments is to kill cancerous cells. However, althoughtreatments of this nature are known to be harmful to the patient, they arebelieved to be able to kill the causal agents of disease and therefore restorethe patient to health.The notion that poisons can preserve or restore health is entirely unfounded; itis impossible to poison a body back to health.The inherently toxic nature of pharmaceuticals means that their effects arealways harmful, as Herbert Shelton explains,> “The only legitimate study of drugs in their relation to the body is that of> toxicology. The local, general, synergistic, antagonistic, therapeutic and> physiological ‘actions’ of drugs are myths, equally with their ‘empiric> actions’. That they accumulate in the body, that they occasion ‘side actions’,> that they poison and injure, we do not deny. We only deny that they ever do> anything else.”It is clear therefore, that the idea that pharmaceuticals can have a‘beneficial’ effect on health is grossly mistaken. The reason they may appear tobe beneficial is due to a complete misunderstanding of the nature and functionsof the human body. As discussed in more detail later in this chapter, the humanbody is not mechanistic in nature; it is not an inert, albeit living, machine.On the contrary, it is a complex, self-regulating organism that is the only‘agent’ with the ability to defeat disease; it is only the body that is able torestore and maintain health, which is the body’s natural state.A problem can only be solved when the nature of the problem has been fullyunderstood and its root cause or causes have been correctly identified. Oncethis knowledge has been gained, it is possible to devise and implement theappropriate measures that have the ability to address the causes and therebyresolve the problem, which will eventually cease to exist.It is clear that the problem of disease remains unresolved by the medicalestablishment; unfortunately, it is a problem that is not even in the process ofbeing resolved. On the contrary, it is a continually worsening problem; thehealth of the vast majority of the people around the world is deteriorating notimproving.One of the main contributory factors to this problem is the fact that themedical establishment, which has assumed responsibility for the health of theentire world population, operates from the basis of fundamentally flawed beliefsabout diseases and their causes as well, as the methods by which they should betreated and prevented. The rigid adherence to these erroneous beliefsperpetuates the existence of a serious obstacle to the medical establishment’sability to gain a full understanding of the real nature of disease, and therebysolve the problem.The failure of modern medicine to solve this problem does not mean that itcannot be solved; as the discussions in this chapter will demonstrate.The Nature of ‘Disease’The establishment defines a ‘disease’ as,> “a disorder with a specific cause (which may or may not be known) and> recognizable signs and symptoms…”It is a core assertion of this book that the medical establishment has a poorlevel of understanding of the real nature of ‘disease’. Whilst this assertionwill no doubt be considered highly controversial; it is neverthelesscorroborated by many of the medical establishment’s own statements. Thediscussions in chapter seven, for example, reveal admissions that not only arethe exact causes of a number of major NCDs unknown, but that many aspects ofthese diseases remain poorly understood. In addition, although infectiousdiseases are claimed to be understood, the discussions in chapter three revealthe existence of many anomalies and contradictions that seriously challenge thisclaim, and show that many aspects of these diseases also remain poorlyunderstood.In addition to the three beliefs discussed in the previous section, modernmedicine has also adopted two philosophical doctrines; namely, mechanism, whichposits the view that the human body is little more than a complex, albeitliving, machine, and determinism, which posits the view that events are largelygoverned by pre-determining factors. In the context of disease, these doctrinesmean that the human organism, which is considered to be essentially ‘inert’, canbe attacked by any disease ‘entity’ as the result of certain pre-determiningfactors, especially genes, and that the battle against these disease entities,especially ‘germs’, can be successfully fought by the methods and practices ofmodern medicine. This is discussed in a 1977 article entitled Modern Medicine’sShortcomings: Can We Really Conquer Disease? that states,> “Modern medicine holds to an essentially deterministic and mechanistic view of> disease, in which the individual has no control over his disease and> consequently must submit himself to the intervention of an external agent.”Although this view of disease is in accordance with the beliefs that underpinthe practices of modern medicine, it too is fundamentally flawed.It is clear therefore, that there are many genuine gaps in the knowledge themedical establishment claims to possess about disease, whether infectious ornoncommunicable; however, it is generally believed that these knowledge gapswill be closed when sufficient information has accumulated as the result ofmedical research. But this is a mistaken belief; these gaps will not be closedby research conducted within a medical system that operates from the basis of aninadequate understanding of the fundamental nature of the problem it isstudying.Diseases are claimed to be identifiable by their signs and symptoms, but anumber of diseases, especially those referred to as ‘infectious’, are associatedwith the same symptoms; fever, cough, fatigue and diarrhoea, for example, arecommon to many of them. The treatment of these conditions involves the use ofmedicines to alleviate the patient’s symptoms, on the basis that the cessationof symptoms means that the disease has been defeated. If their symptoms fail torespond to this initial treatment, it may be suggested that the patient shouldundergo certain tests that will enable a more accurate diagnosis of the diseaseand lead to more effective treatment. The fact that such tests may need to beconducted in order to correctly identify a patient’s disease, would seem tocontradict the claim that diseases have recognisable signs and symptoms; many ofthem clearly do not.The study of disease is conducted within the scientific field of pathology, theestablishment definition of which is,> “the study of disease processes with the aim of understanding their nature and> causes.”This is, however, rather misleading; a process involves actions, but pathologyis the study of effects, not actions; as indicated by the definition, whichcontinues with the statement that,> “This is achieved by observing samples of blood, urine, faeces and diseased> tissue obtained from the living patient or at autopsy by the use of X-rays and> many other techniques.”The study of samples of this nature involves a variety of preparation proceduresto facilitate their observation under a microscope. The nature of theseprocedures is described by Dr Harold Hillman in his previously cited 2011article entitled Cell Biology at the Beginning of the 21st Century is in DireStraits, which bears repetition,> “When a tissue is prepared for histology, histochemistry, electron microscopy,> or immunochemistry, an animal is killed; the tissue is excised; it is fixed or> frozen; it is embedded; it is sectioned; it is rehydrated; it is stained; it> is mounted; it is radiated by light, or bombarded by electron beams.”Although this refers to the study of animal tissue, the same, or very similar,procedures are employed in the study of diseased tissue obtained from a humanpatient, but these procedures, as well as the chemicals used as stains andfixatives, directly affect the tissue samples, which are clearly no longer alivewhen observed. Furthermore, the laboratory apparatus and the laboratory itselfare sterile environments that bear no resemblance whatsoever to the naturalenvironment of the tissue samples within the human body, from which they havebeen removed. Unfortunately, as discussed in chapter three, researchers aremostly oblivious of the extent to which their preparation procedures affect thesamples they study.It is acknowledged by some researchers that there are certain limitations tolaboratory studies of this nature and to the conclusions that can be drawn fromthem with respect to their relevance to human disease; this is, however, a grossunderstatement. The changes to tissue samples produced by both the environmentin which they are studied and the procedures to which they are subjected, are ofsuch a profound nature that they raise serious questions about the ability ofsuch studies to ascertain any useful information about the nature or causes ofhuman disease.This problem is compounded by the fact that the medical establishment operatesaccording to a mechanistic view, on the basis of which it is believed that eachdisease is unique and identifiable by the specific effects it produces withinthe human body, which is also claimed to function mechanistically. If themechanistic view were correct, the effects of each disease would be uniform andpredictable, and all patients diagnosed with the same disease would exhibitexactly the same symptoms. Similarly, patients with the same disease would allrespond in exactly the same manner to the same treatments, whether medicines orvaccines. But this does not reflect reality; in the real world, there is a greatdeal of variability, not only in the nature and severity of the symptomsexhibited by people diagnosed with the same disease, but also in people’sresponses to the same medicines; there is also a wide variability in people’sreactions to vaccines. It is clear therefore, that the mechanistic viewcompletely fails to represent an accurate description of the nature of diseaseor the functions of the human body.Although the vast majority of disease research studies have been conducted withnon-living samples, a few have been conducted with living specimens and thesehave generated some useful insights. The most significant insight, which hasbeen gained from the study of cells and bacteria in particular, is the extent towhich these living specimens can be affected by their environment.As previously discussed, bacteria have demonstrated the ability to change theirform in response to changes in their environment; a phenomenon known aspleomorphism. Living cells also respond to the condition of the environment inwhich they are placed, as demonstrated by Dr Bruce Lipton who describes hisexperiments with living cells in his book entitled The Biology of Belief andstates that,> “When I provided a healthy environment for my cells they thrived; when the> environment was less than optimal, the cells faltered. When I adjusted the> environment, these ‘sick’ cells revitalized.”The effect of the environment on human health has also been recognised by themedical establishment in the previously cited Healthy Environments report.The ‘environment’ referred to is clearly the ‘external’ environment; but thehealth of living organisms is also affected by the condition of their ‘internal’environment. All substances and influences that have the ability to adverselyaffect any aspect of the environment, whether internal or external, willadversely affect the health of the living organisms exposed to them. It is cleartherefore, that harmful substances and influences not only contribute toill-health, but, in reality, are some of the main causes of disease.It is not the purpose of this section to discuss the causes of diseases, whichare discussed later in the chapter; the ensuing discussion examines the realnature of the phenomenon known as ‘disease’.The philosophical principle known as Ockham’s razor proposes that, when facedwith different explanations about a phenomenon, the simplest one that containsthe least number of assumptions is the one that is most likely to be correct.This principle will therefore be applied to the different explanations of‘disease’, to determine which of them is the most appropriate to thisphenomenon.The first explanation to be examined in more detail is that of ‘modernmedicine’, which, according to the establishment definition, describes ‘disease’as,> “any bodily abnormality or failure to function properly…”Although seemingly simple, this description is based upon the underlying beliefthat each bodily abnormality or malfunction is indicative of a unique diseaseentity that has attacked the body, and produced the signs and symptoms by whichit can be identified. But, although claimed to be true, this belief represents acollection of assumptions including the notion that there are many hundreds, ifnot thousands, of different diseases that each affect the body in a specificmanner and produce recognisable signs and symptoms.It is indisputable that people can and do experience varying combinations ofsymptoms, but the existence of different symptom-complexes, together with thefact that each has been assigned a specific label, do not constitute irrefutableevidence of the existence of unique disease entities. As previously discussed,there is a great deal of variability in the nature and severity of the symptomsthat people diagnosed with the same disease can experience; this variabilityposes a serious challenge to the assumption that each disease produces distinctand easily recognisable symptoms.The medical establishment claims that disease exists in two forms; that they canbe either infectious or non-infectious, although the latter are usually referredto as noncommunicable. The idea that certain diseases are infectious is based onthe theory that pathogenic microorganisms invade and infect the body therebycausing disease; this theory also claims that ‘germs’ are transmissible betweenpeople. It is generally asserted by proponents of modern medicine that thistheory has been established beyond any doubt, but this is not the case. Aspreviously discussed, the explanations about infectious diseases contain manyanomalies, one of which is that ‘infection’ is not always accompanied bysymptoms; another is that ‘infection’ is not always followed by disease. Yetanother anomaly is that infected people do not always transmit their ‘germs’ toothers. These anomalies remain unexplained; they therefore challenge theunderlying assumptions of the theories pertaining to ‘infectious diseases’.In addition, many other aspects of these diseases also remain unexplained; forexample, the medical establishment provides no explanations of the mechanisms bywhich microorganisms are able to cause disease, or the mechanisms by which theyare able to induce a range of symptoms that vary widely in severity, and caneven cause death. The failure to explain these mechanisms poses yet anotherdirect challenge to the veracity of the claim that microorganisms cause disease.These challenges, as well as the discussions in chapter three, provide a clearrefutation of the ‘germ theory’ and repudiate the existence of the phenomenonreferred to as an ‘infectious disease’.The explanations about noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are acknowledged tocontain many unknown and poorly understood aspects, but they too, contain anumber of assumptions. One of these assumptions is that ‘genetic factors’ play amajor role in increasing the risk that a person will develop or die from an NCD;in other words, it is claimed as a fact that people with certain genes have a‘genetic predisposition’ to develop a specific disease such as cancer, forexample. But this is not a fact; the idea that genes are determining factorshas, as previously discussed, been proven to be unfounded by the Human GenomeProject.The idea that genetic factors determine a person’s state of health has also beendisproven by research in the field of epigenetics, which Dr Lipton discusses inThe Biology of Belief. He explains that genes do not control biology, whichmeans that people do not have a ‘genetic predisposition’ to any disease, andstates that,> “In the last decade, epigenetic research has established that DNA blueprints> passed down through genes are not set in concrete at birth. Genes are not> destiny.”Despite the importance of these new research findings, the WHO has failed toamend the fact sheet about NCDs, the June 2018 version of which continues toclaim that these diseases can result from a combination of factors that include‘genetic factors’.Although individual NCDs were discussed in chapter seven, it is possible forpeople to be affected by more than one of these chronic conditions. Theco-occurrence of two or more chronic conditions in the same patient is aphenomenon known as multimorbidity, which is acknowledged to be increasing inincidence, as indicated by a 2016 article entitled Multimorbidity: What do weknow? What should we do? that states,> “The number of people affected by multiple chronic diseases (multimorbidity)> is increasing dramatically around the world…”The growing prevalence of multimorbidity has also been recognised in a 2016 WHOreport entitled Multimorbidity that states,> “People living with a long-term condition often have multiple rather than a> single condition. Such multimorbidity is common and has been rising in> prevalence over recent years.”This statement is highly significant as it contradicts the most recent GlobalBurden of Disease (GBD) report of 2017, which asserts that people around theworld have been experiencing improved health. A November 2018 editorial in TheLancet entitled GBD 2017: a fragile world claims that the GBD reports for theprevious ten years have,> “…portrayed an ever-healthier world.”The explanation in the 2016 WHO report for the increased incidence ofmultimorbidity is that it is related to increased life-expectancy, because it isa phenomenon that occurs more frequently in people over the age of 65; yet thereport also states that,> “…the absolute number of people with multimorbidity has been found to be> higher in those younger than 65 years…”However, although it may be more common in people of advanced years,multimorbidity is not an inevitable consequence of ageing.The medical establishment admits to the existence of knowledge gaps with respectto individual chronic conditions; it is therefore unsurprising that there aregaps in their knowledge about multimorbidity. These gaps are recognised by TheAcademy of Medical Sciences in a 2018 report entitled Multimorbidity: a priorityfor global health research, which will be referred to as the AMS report, thatstates,> “While it is generally accepted that multimorbidity is an increasing global> health challenge, there remain massive gaps in our knowledge.”Part of the reason for the existence of these knowledge gaps is claimed to bedue to insufficient research, as the report also states,> “Research into multimorbidity in younger adults and those living in low- and> middle-income countries is particularly lacking.”Whilst a lack of research certainly hinders an understanding about the extent ofthe problem, increased research will not help to explain the reason for itsexistence, nor will it help to solve the problem, mainly because it will notresult in the medical establishment altering its typical approach towards thetreatment of disease.Patients diagnosed with a single chronic condition are prescribed the medicinedeemed to be the appropriate treatment for that condition. Patients diagnosedwith multiple chronic conditions are therefore prescribed multiple medicines,each of which is deemed to be the appropriate treatment for each of theirdiseases; the use of multiple medicines to treat multiple conditions is referredto as polypharmacy. However, as previously discussed, all medicines are known toproduce unintended adverse effects; this means that patients who take multiplemedicines will invariably experience multiple adverse effects; a fact that isacknowledged in a March 2015 BMJ editorial entitled Guidelines, polypharmacy anddrug-drug interactions with multimorbidity that states,> “One common consequence of polypharmacy is the high rate of adverse drug> reactions…”Furthermore, people diagnosed with multimorbidity can suffer from varyingcombinations of different chronic conditions, as the AMS report states,> “While there are limited data about the most commonly occurring clusters of> conditions, it is accepted that multimorbidity is highly heterogenous and> patients can experience a wide array of different combinations of conditions.”Patients with multimorbidity are treated with varying combinations of differentmedicines, each of which is claimed to have the ability to target, and thereforecorrect, the bodily abnormality or malfunction associated with each disease. Butthis claim is unfounded; the effects that a medicine can induce can occur inmany different parts of the body, they are not restricted to the specifiedtarget site. The use of multiple medicines can therefore result in multipleeffects in multiple parts of the body; as the previously cited 2015 BMJ articlestates,> “Drugs have a network of effects that go well beyond a specific drug target,> particularly in patients with multimorbidity.”The main problem is that pharmaceuticals are almost entirely untested for theirefficacy, safety or potential adverse effects in the multiple combinations thatmay be prescribed to patients with multiple chronic conditions, as the AMSreport explains,> “Although all medicines are rigorously tested, clinical trials for particular> medical conditions don’t usually include patients suffering from other> conditions – which means there isn’t a bank of good evidence showing how> different medicines work together in patients suffering from multimorbidity.”One of the reasons that the vast majority of drug combinations remain untestedis suggested by a 2018 article entitled Artificial intelligence helps Stanfordcomputer scientists predict the side effects of millions of drug combinations,which admits that,> “Millions of people take upward of five medications a day, but testing the> side effects of such combinations is impractical.”The ‘impracticability’ of conducting such extensive tests means that patientsdiagnosed with multimorbidity will have little, if any, information about thefull range of potential ‘side effects’ they may experience, as the result of theparticular combination of multiple medicines they have been prescribed astreatment for their particular combination of multiple chronic conditions.Multiple medicines are also used in the treatment of a single disease; therecommended treatment of TB for example, involves the use of multipleantibiotics. This phenomenon, referred to as ‘polypharmacology’, is alsoincreasingly common. The reason that multiple drugs are deemed to be necessaryfor the treatment of a single condition is explained by a 2014 article entitledSystematic prediction of drug combinations based on clinical side-effects, whichstates that a single drug,> “…sometimes shows limited efficacy, especially for complex diseases…”Some of the most common diseases for which multiple drugs are used, because asingle drug shows ‘limited efficacy’, are those said to be caused by bacteria.The reason that a single antibiotic drug is not effective is claimed to bebecause the bacteria have developed ‘resistance’ to it; but the use of multipleantibiotics is not necessarily more effective, as indicated by the phenomenon ofMDR-TB (multidrug-resistant TB). However, bacteria are not the onlymicroorganisms claimed to have developed ‘drug resistance’, which is perceivedto pose a dire threat to health; as indicated by the February 2018 WHO factsheet entitled Antimicrobial resistance that claims this to be,> “…an increasingly serious threat to global public health…”This claim is misleading for reasons discussed in chapter three.The discussions presented within this book show that the explanations of diseasepromulgated by the medical establishment are fraught with problems of such aprofound nature, that they challenge the veracity of the underlying theories,and raise doubts as to whether these explanations can be considered to fulfilthe criteria of Ockham’s razor as the most likely to be correct. These problemsinevitably raise the further question of whether another explanation of diseaseexists that is better able to fulfil these criteria.The forms of healthcare that operate outside of the ‘mainstream’ are commonlyreferred to as ‘complementary and alternative medicine’ (CAM), but proponents of‘modern medicine’ invariably dismiss these as ‘unorthodox’, and refer to themusing such derogatory terms as unscientific, pseudo-science, pseudo-medicine orquackery.These CAM healthcare systems incorporate a wide variety of different practices,but often adopt a similar approach; for example, many employ the use of‘natural’ substances as medicines and treat the patient rather than the disease.Whilst this approach may be considered preferable to that of the medicalestablishment, it is nevertheless dependent upon the same underlying theories,which are: that there are many distinctly different diseases; that certaindiseases are caused by ‘germs’; and that people affected by disease can onlyrecover their health through treatment with some form of medicine. But thesetheories are flawed; any healthcare system that adopts an approach based on themwill clearly be subject to the same, or at least very similar, problems as thoseencountered by the medical establishment. These systems are therefore, unable tofurnish a more credible explanation of ‘disease’ than that of the medicalestablishment.There are, however, ‘non-mainstream’ healthcare systems that operate from thebasis of a different approach towards disease, its causes and treatment. Themost notable of these is Natural Hygiene, which was developed during the 19thcentury. Although some of the early practitioners were qualified medicaldoctors, the pioneers of Natural Hygiene rejected the approach adopted by modernmedicine, especially with respect to the use of ‘medicines’, which theyrecognised to be toxic, and with respect to the study of disease within theconfines of the laboratory, as Herbert Shelton, a lifelong practitioner ofNatural Hygiene, explains,> “Its modern pioneers were brilliant men who were not afraid to depart from the> ruts of orthodoxy and search for truth in despised places, but they were not> men of the cloistered laboratory.”In their search to understand the real nature of disease, these men studied the‘laws of nature’ and the application of these laws to human health. The studiesthese pioneers conducted over the course of many years, led them, and many whofollowed them, to the understanding that ‘disease’ is not an entity that attacksthe body and needs to be fought and destroyed through the use of toxic‘medicines’. Their departure from orthodoxy, although earning derision fromtheir contemporaries engaged in ‘modern medicine’, enabled them to develop avery different understanding of the nature of the human body, which theyrecognised to be a living organism that functions holistically in accordancewith ‘laws of nature’. They also discovered that anything that disrupts thebody’s functions will have a detrimental impact on health, as Herbert Sheltonexplains,> “The human organism is an indivisible whole and anything that tends to> interfere with the unity of its structure or the unity of its function becomes> a factor in the causation of disease.”The explanation of disease presented by Natural Hygiene can therefore bearticulated as follows: ‘disease’ represents disruptions to the body’s abilityto function properly, and ‘symptoms’ are the manifestation of the body’sresponses to the presence of harmful substances and influences that includeactions to expel toxins, repair damage and restore the body to its natural stateof health.The credibility of this new explanation can be demonstrated by reference to twosymptoms, namely vomiting and diarrhoea. According to the medical establishmentview, these symptoms are indicative of a ‘disease’ that is often, buterroneously, attributed to ‘germs’. Yet no explanation is offered for themechanism by which pathogens are able to cause these symptoms, the severity ofwhich can vary widely. Such symptoms are however, perfectly explicable withinthe context of the new explanation of disease, as the body’s responses to thepresence in the digestive system of harmful substances and its efforts to expelthem, as Herbert Shelton explains,> “A poison is taken into the stomach; the organism senses the presence of a> non-usable and harmful substance and prepares to act accordingly. It is sent> out by vomiting, or it is sent along the digestive tract into the colon and is> expelled by means of a violent diarrhea.”The digestive system is clearly not the only part of the body that can beaffected by harmful substances that need to be expelled; toxic materials canalso enter the body through inhalation, absorption through the skin orinjection, both intradermal and intramuscular. The route by which toxins enterthe body will determine the tissues and organs that will be affected, and thenature of the responses the body will produce to expel them. Air pollutants, forexample, which are inhaled, will have a greater impact on the respiratorysystem. The body’s efforts to expel inhaled toxins will include symptoms such assneezing and coughing, which are amongst the symptoms typical of respiratory‘diseases’ such as asthma; the association between the inhalation of toxicirritants and asthma was discussed in chapter seven.As the discussions in chapter six made perfectly clear, there are a huge numberand wide variety of harmful substances and influences to which people areexposed in varying combinations on a daily basis; but these ‘poisons’ are notalways or immediately expelled in such a simple manner as those that enter thedigestive system. Some toxic substances, such as dioxins for example,bioaccumulate and are therefore more difficult to expel. But this does not meanthat the body is powerless to expel toxins of this nature; on the contrary, thebody possesses many self-protective mechanisms, as Herbert Shelton explains,> “When poisonous matter has accumulated in the system to the point where it> becomes a menace to life, the body makes a violent effort to cast it out and> we have pain, inflammations, fevers, and the whole train of acute diseases.”The use of the term ‘acute diseases’ in the above statement should not beconstrued as confirmation of the existence of distinctly different types ofdisease, for this is not his intended meaning. Instead, this term is used torepresent short-lived conditions that are accompanied by self-limiting symptomssuch as fever, sneezing, coughing, vomiting and diarrhoea, all of which areclearly indicative of the body’s response to the presence of harmful substancesand influences, and its efforts to expel them. As Herbert Shelton explains, theterm ‘acute disease’ refers to,> “…vital action in some one or all of the living tissues or organs in resisting> and expelling injurious substances and influences and in repairing damages.”When the body has expelled the ‘injurious substances’, these vital actions, orsymptoms, will subside and then cease; but the cessation of symptoms should notbe interpreted to indicate that all toxic materials have been eliminated fromthe body. The body constantly seeks to attain and maintain itself in the stateof ‘health’, the vital actions necessary to expel toxins, repair damage andrestore health are therefore ongoing processes that continue throughout life, asHerbert Shelton explains,> “The struggle of the system to cast out its accumulated toxins continues so> long as the organism remains alive.”It should be clear therefore, that the greater the level of accumulated toxinsin the body, the greater the effort required to eliminate them; toxins and theirelimination are discussed in more detail later in this chapter.Unfortunately, the body’s vital actions in resisting and expelling harmfulsubstances are interpreted as symptoms that need to be ‘cured’ through the useof medicine. However, pharmaceuticals, as well as a number of ‘natural’medicines, contain substances that the body recognises as harmful and thereforeneed to be expelled through the appropriate vital actions; but these actions arethen interpreted as symptoms of yet another disease that needs to be cured. Thisinevitably leads to a vicious cycle of diseases and ‘cures’; a cycle thatresults in a progression from a series of ‘acute diseases’ to more seriousconditions, usually referred to as ‘chronic diseases’, as Herbert Sheltonexplains,> “A child frequently develops colds. It develops sore throat, tonsillitis,> bronchitis, pneumonia, all of which are cured, and soon followed by another> cold, another tonsillitis, another bronchitis, and this process continues> until chronic disease of the lungs evolves.”Chronic diseases are invariably of a longer duration and indicative of a farmore serious health problem than acute diseases; they are therefore associatedwith very different symptoms, most of which do not represent obvious efforts toexpel toxins, but they do represent the body’s efforts to protect itself, repairdamage and restore health. This means that the ‘new’ explanation of disease isequally applicable to chronic conditions, the symptoms of which are indicativeof disruptions to the body’s ability to function properly; cardiovasculardiseases, for example, are a group of chronic conditions that representdysfunctions within the cardiovascular system.The real functions of the symptoms associated with chronic conditions can bedemonstrated by the example of inflammation, which is acknowledged to be thebody’s response to injury, but is erroneously claimed by the medicalestablishment to be a main cause of many chronic conditions, including majorNCDs. Inflammation is claimed to be a serious symptom that needs to besuppressed with anti-inflammatory drugs such as NSAIDs; but this course ofaction is based on a mistaken understanding of the role of inflammation. Inaddition to being the body’s response to injuries and wounds, inflammation isalso one of the mechanisms by which the body repairs damage; it is described byHerbert Shelton as ‘remedial action’. The purpose of inflammation in both injuryand disease is to provide the affected area with an increased supply of repairmaterials through an increased supply of blood. When the damage has beenrepaired, the blood supply returns to normal and inflammation ceases; thecontinuing presence of inflammation indicates that the damage has not been fullyrepaired, but it can be prolonged for other reasons, as discussed later in thissection.It has been demonstrated in many of the discussions in this book thatpharmaceuticals are inherently toxic due to the nature of some, if not all oftheir ingredients; but this toxicity is virtually always intentional, the mainpurpose of the ‘active’ chemical ingredients of pharmaceuticals is to defeatdisease or kill germs. Nevertheless, despite their toxicity, pharmaceuticals arecredited with the ability to restore health. It should be noted that many‘natural’ medicines, which are similarly credited with the ability to restorehealth, also contain toxic ingredients.One of the main reasons that medicines, whether pharmaceutical or natural, areclaimed to successfully achieve their intended purpose, is because people reportthat their symptoms reduced in severity, and even ceased entirely after they hadtaken the ‘medicine’. They therefore attribute their ‘recovery’ from illness tothe actions of the medicine; but this attribution is misplaced. No medicinepossesses the ability to heal the body; the only ‘agent’ that does possess thisability is the body itself. The recovery from illness is solely due to thebody’s innate self-healing mechanisms, as Herbert Shelton explains,> “It is these processes of resistance and expulsion and the processes by which> damages are repaired that are mistaken for the actions of drugs.”The most significant departure from orthodoxy of the early practitioners ofNatural Hygiene was the rejection of the foundational beliefs on which ‘modernmedicine’ is based, especially the belief that medicines cure disease. It isparticularly notable that many of these practitioners were medical doctors whohad obtained their qualification through the mainstream medical system, butrejected that system when they recognised its failings. Their studies led themto discover that obedience to the ‘laws of nature’ was the only effective methodby which health could be attained, and they therefore incorporated this approachinto their treatment of patients. In his book Toxemia Explained, Dr John TildenMD refers to his experiences of using and then eschewing the use of ‘medicines’;his words, which were cited in chapter one, bear repetition,> “Twenty-five years in which I used drugs, and thirty-three in which I have not> used drugs, should make my belief that drugs are unnecessary and in most cases> injurious, worth something to those who care to know the truth.”It is appropriate to therefore examine the explanation of disease presented byNatural Hygiene in the context of the criteria of Ockham’s razor. As statedearlier, this ‘new’ explanation states that ‘disease’ represents disruptions tothe body’s ability to function properly, and that ‘symptoms’ are themanifestation of the body’s responses to the presence of harmful substances andinfluences that include actions to expel toxins, repair damage and restore thebody to its natural state of health.In addition to its simplicity and lack of assumptions, this ‘new’ explanationdispels the many anomalies raised by the medical establishment explanation; forexample, the varying nature and severity of the symptoms experienced by peoplealleged to have the same disease is no longer an anomaly because people do nothave the same disease. Each person experiences differing symptoms that aremanifestations of their body’s response to the conditions within their ‘innerenvironment’; as discussed in the later sections about the causes of ‘disease’.Furthermore, this ‘new’ explanation of disease does not depend on assumptionsabout unknown processes, such as the mechanisms by which ‘germs’ are able toinduce a wide variety of symptoms.It is clear that this ‘new’ explanation of disease is the simplest and the onewith the least number of assumptions; it therefore qualifies, in accordance withOckham’s razor, to be the one that is most likely to be correct. The veracity ofthis explanation is not only ‘likely’, but can be shown to be fully inaccordance with a large and growing body of scientific evidence, as will bedemonstrated.It should be noted that, although the ‘new’ explanation of disease presented byNatural Hygiene forms the basis of the discussions in this chapter, this bookpresents a few differences with respect to some of the details. For example, thediscussions in this book have demonstrated that ‘germs’ play no role whatsoeverin disease, whereas the proponents of Natural Hygiene suggest that they may playa secondary, albeit minor role. In addition, the discussions in this finalchapter provide a fuller explanation of the nature of disease, as well as theprocesses involved; they also include reference to all of the factors thatcontribute to the development of disease.This ‘new’ explanation of disease, although highly controversial because of itsdivergence from orthodoxy, is corroborated by the findings of scientificresearch into the processes involved in virtually all diseases. One of its mainassertions is that individual disease entities do not exist; that what havetraditionally been referred to as different ‘diseases’ are, in reality,different expressions of an underlying disruption to the body’s normal functionsthat manifest as a variety of different symptoms. Although the idea that thereare no distinct disease entities may also be regarded as controversial, it isnevertheless corroborated by a growing body of evidence that demonstrates all‘diseases’ share a common underlying mechanism. This common mechanism isoxidative stress; as indicated by a June 2000 article entitled The Evolution ofFree Radicals and Oxidative Stress, which states that,> “Perhaps the most noteworthy observation concerning the role of oxidative> stress in human disease is the commonality of it.”Free radicals are produced by the body’s normal processes, including cellmetabolism; but these molecules have unpaired electrons, which makes them highlyreactive and potentially dangerous because, if not reduced by antioxidants, theycan cause serious damage to the surrounding cells. The existence in the body ofoxidative stress indicates the presence of an excessive level of free radicalsthat have begun the process of damaging the body’s cells; it should be notedthat cellular damage is also a common feature of ‘disease’.The growing body of research that has found oxidative stress to be the commonunderlying mechanism, although with different manifestations, of most, if notall noncommunicable diseases, is demonstrated by a 2014 article entitledIntroduction: oxidation and inflammation, a molecular link betweennon-communicable diseases, which states that,> “Recent investigations show that many of these diseases share common> pathophysiological mechanisms and are, at least in part, different> manifestations in different organs of similar molecular alterations.”Pathophysiology is the study of functional changes that occur as the result ofdisease.The article also states that,> “Mitochondrial alterations, oxidative stress and inflammation are inextricably> linked and play major roles in the onset and development of non-communicable> diseases.”It should be noted that mitochondrial alterations, or dysfunctions, can occur asthe result of oxidative stress and the ensuing free radical damage.Inflammation is a significant aspect of many major NCDs, but it is not a causalfactor as the medical establishment suggests. Instead, it is oxidative stress,which is the underlying mechanism common to virtually all NCDs, that causesinflammation; as indicated by a 2014 article entitled The role of oxidativestress during inflammatory processes that states,> “In recent years, evidence has emerged that oxidative stress plays a crucial> role in the development and perpetuation of inflammation.”As stated earlier in this section, inflammation may persist, especially withincertain organs and tissues of the body where damage has occurred; but the reasonthat inflammation persists is because of the persistence of its underlyingcause, namely oxidative stress.The commonality of oxidative stress and free radical damage in NCDs also appliesto cancer, as indicated by a 2014 article entitled Inflammation, Free RadicalDamage, Oxidative Stress and Cancer that states,> “Tumor cells usually have an imbalanced redox status…”Redox is the abbreviation of reduction-oxidation. Redox status is described asthe balance between oxidants and antioxidants.The discussion about cancer in chapter seven refers to the link betweenaneuploidy and cancer, in addition to which is a substantial volume of evidencethat links aneuploidy and cancer to oxidative stress. This provides yet moreevidence of the commonality of the processes and mechanisms involved in allconditions of ill-health, and further demonstrates the veracity of the ‘new’explanation of disease.Although oxidative stress is mainly associated with noncommunicable diseases, ithas been recognised for more than two decades to also be associated with‘infectious diseases’; as indicated by a 1995 article entitled The role ofoxidative stress in HIV disease, which states that,> “Indications of oxidative stress are observed in asymptomatic HIV-infected> patients early in the course of the disease.”The medical establishment claims that one of the functions of free radicals isto defend the body against an attack by ‘pathogenic microorganisms’; but thisclaim is clearly erroneous. If it were correct, the co-existence of oxidativestress and ‘infection’ with HIV, or any other so-called ‘germ’, would not bepossible, because the invading pathogen should have been destroyed by the freeradicals. This is yet another anomaly within the context of the ‘germ theory’ ofdisease. This anomaly is, however, removed by reference to the ‘new’ explanationof disease, which excludes any reference to ‘germs’, but fully recognises therole of oxidative stress and free radical damage.Oxidative stress has also been observed to occur in cases of infections allegedto be caused by parasites, as indicated by a 2012 article entitled Involvementof free radicals in parasitic infestations that states,> “Several studies have reported the presence of oxidative stress in humans and> animals infected with parasites…”These ‘infestations’ include the parasites alleged to be the cause of malaria,as indicated by a 2012 article entitled Oxidative Stress in Malaria, whichadmits to the existence of yet another knowledge gap in the statement that,> “Despite the significant effort to eradicate this dangerous disease, lack of> complete knowledge of its physiopathology compromises the success in this> enterprise.”Both of these articles claim that oxidative stress is caused by the‘infections’, but this is clearly a complete contradiction of the claim that thepurpose of free radicals is to defend the body against ‘infection’. Furthermore,despite the assertion that ‘infections’ cause oxidative stress, the medicalestablishment does not understand the mechanisms involved, as indicated by a2017 article entitled Oxidative stress in infection and consequent disease,which refers to ‘overwhelming evidence’ of the existence of oxidative stress inmany ‘infectious diseases’ but states that,> “…the impact of the majority of infectious agents on the host redux systems is> not sufficiently characterized, with published data plagued by controversies.”Unfortunately, these controversies will persist whilst the medical establishmentcontinues to believe that microorganisms are pathogenic.Another particularly significant discovery is that oxidative stress, with theresulting free radical damage, is the common mechanism by which all of the‘substances and influences’ that cause disease produce their harmful effects.The association between toxic substances and oxidative stress was recognisedmore than two decades ago, as indicated by a 1995 article, entitled The role offree radicals in toxicity and disease, which explains that,> “The toxicity of many xenobiotics is associated with the metabolic activation> of foreign compounds to form free radicals…”Xenobiotics are substances that are foreign to the body; a term that is commonlyused to refer to synthetic chemicals, including pharmaceuticals.The inclusion of pharmaceuticals in the category of ‘xenobiotics’ providesfurther corroboration of the assertion that the body recognises ‘medicines’ as‘foreign compounds’ that are toxic and therefore need to be expelled. Theassertion that pharmaceuticals are damaging rather than health-promoting is alsosubstantiated by the acknowledgement that they produce the same mechanism bywhich all toxins cause damage. In other words, pharmaceuticals also increase thegeneration of free radicals; as indicated by the above cited article aboutmalaria, which states that the drugs used in the treatment of the disease,> “…are inducers of free radical production.”Although free radicals are produced by normal metabolic functions, the body hasinnate mechanisms to protect itself against free radical damage; as indicated bya 2008 article entitled Free Radicals, Antioxidants in Disease and Health thatstates,> “The human body has several mechanisms to counteract oxidative stress by> producing antioxidants…”However, in order for these protective mechanisms to function properly, the bodymust be provided with all of the materials these mechanisms require. Althoughmany antioxidants are obtained from the diet, some are also producedendogenously; but they are both necessary to protect the body from free radicaldamage, as the article states,> “Endogenous and exogenous antioxidants act as ‘free radical scavengers’ by> preventing and repairing damages caused by ROS and RNS…”ROS are reactive oxygen species and RNS are reactive nitrogen species.The discussion in this section has demonstrated that ‘disease’ is not an entitythat attacks the body, but represents dysfunctions within the body that have thesame underlying mechanism. This unity of ‘disease’ can therefore be shown to befully consistent with what has been referred to as the ‘new’ explanation ofdisease, but, in reality, should now be recognised to represent the real natureof disease, and therefore be the only explanation.However, although the body is perfectly capable of maintaining itself in a stateof health, the innate self-protective and self-healing mechanisms it employs canonly be fully effective when they are supported by observing the ‘laws ofnature’. These ‘laws’ require that, where possible, exposures to harmfulsubstances and influences should be avoided or minimised if complete avoidanceis not possible. In addition, these ‘laws’ require that attention is paid to thesubstances consumed as food; the importance of ‘nutrition’ cannot be overstated.The laws of nature can only be followed with sufficient knowledge about thefactors that support health, so that they can be increased, and the factors thatimpede health, so that they can be avoided. These factors are the topics of theremaining sections of this chapter, after a brief discussion about the role of‘physical activity’.Fitness & ExerciseThe February 2018 WHO fact sheet entitled Physical activity states that,> “Insufficient physical activity is one of the leading risk factors for death> worldwide.”In addition, one of the ‘key facts’ is claimed to be that,> “Globally, 1 in 4 adults is not active enough.”These are extremely bold claims, especially in view of the fact that the vastmajority of the world population live in countries that are acknowledged to havepoor health data collection systems.The concern of the WHO about the low level of physical activity amongst theadult population, is based on the idea that ‘physical inactivity’ increases therisk of developing and dying from an NCD, as the fact sheet states,> “Insufficient physical activity is a key risk factor for noncommunicable> diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer and diabetes.”Whilst a low level of physical activity may have been observed to correlate witha diagnosis of an NCD, this does not prove the existence of a causalrelationship. The discussion in the previous section showed that oxidativestress is the underlying mechanism of all types of disease, especially chronicdiseases.Despite the attempt to promote the idea that a causal link exists, there is noevidence that physical inactivity alone produces oxidative stress or causes anyNCD. Nevertheless, on the basis of the claim that a causal relationship doesexist, the medical establishment has increased its efforts to promote the healthbenefits of increased physical activity. A major part of this effort is thelaunch of a WHO-led initiative called The Global action plan on physicalactivity 2018-2030 that includes a June 2018 report entitled More Active Peoplefor a Healthier World, which expands on the information in the fact sheet andstates that,> “All forms of physical activity can provide health benefits if undertaken> regularly and of sufficient duration and intensity.”It is not disputed that there are benefits to be gained from a certain level ofphysical activity; these benefits include increased mobility, flexibility andstamina, all of which are aspects of ‘fitness’ that can improve overallwell-being. But the WHO erroneously equates physical activity with health, asindicated by the fact sheet that claims,> “Physical activity has significant health benefits and contributes to prevent> NCDs.”The misleading nature of this claim can be demonstrated by the numerous examplesof athletes who have tragically succumbed to, and even died from CVDs andcancers, the two major noncommunicable diseases. Most significantly, asubstantial number of these athletes died at a very young age, often in their20s or 30s; their high level of physical activity clearly failed to provide themwith significant health benefits or prevent their premature death.The sudden and unexpected death of an adult is a recognised phenomenon known as‘sudden cardiac death’ (SCD), which is defined by a December 2016 articleentitled A Clinical Perspective on Sudden Cardiac Death as,> “…death due to cardiac causes occurring within 1 hour of the onset of> symptoms.”The article discusses the rate of ‘sports-related death’ in the generalpopulation, but adds the comment that,> “The sports-related sudden death rate is higher in elite athletes…”Unfortunately, the article fails to explain why elite athletes experience ahigher rate of sudden death from cardiac problems than the general population;but this finding directly contradicts the WHO claim that physical inactivity,rather than physical activity, increases the risk of dying due to a cardiacproblem.Although previously discussed, it is important to reiterate that the heartfunctions electrically, as acknowledged by the NHLBI (National Heart, Lung, andBlood Institute) web page entitled Sudden Cardiac Arrest, which states that,> “The heart has an electrical system that controls the rate and rhythm of the> heartbeat. Problems with the heart’s electrical system can cause irregular> heartbeats called arrhythmias.”Interestingly, the above cited December 2016 article about Sudden Cardiac Deathstates that,> “SCD with negative pathological and toxicological assessment is termed ‘sudden> arrhythmic death syndrome’.”As previously discussed, ‘sudden death’ is not a syndrome.The adverse health effects of the ‘unnatural’ EM radiation produced by allelectrical devices, electronic equipment and wireless communications have beendiscussed, and will be further discussed later in this chapter; but it isimportant to emphasise the failure of the medical establishment to acknowledgethe serious health hazards of exposures to electromagnetic radiation at levelsfar below that at which heating occurs.The NHLBI web page makes an extremely interesting comment that there is norequirement for a pre-existing condition in cases of sudden cardiac arrest(SCA), which, it states,> “…can happen in people who appear healthy and have no known heart disease or> other risk factors for SCA.”The absence of a pre-existing heart condition raises the inevitable question ofwhat is the real cause of these sudden cardiac problems and sudden deaths.It is obvious that there remain many significant knowledge gaps in theunderstanding the medical establishment claims to possess about ‘sudden’ cardiacproblems, and in particular, the phenomenon of sudden death in otherwise healthyyoung adults; especially athletes who were obviously extremely ‘physicallyactive’. This phenomenon is however, entirely explicable from the perspective ofthe ‘new’ explanation of disease and an understanding of human biology withparticular reference to the body’s normal processes. One of the body’s keyprocesses is metabolism, which the establishment defines as,> “the sum of all the chemical and physical changes that take place within the> body and enable its continued growth and functioning.”As previously discussed, normal metabolic processes involve the generation offree radicals; however, as Dr Russell Blaylock explains in Health and NutritionSecrets, physical activity increases the rate of metabolism, which, in turn,increases the generation of free radicals and, as he states,> “…the number of free radicals generated during exercise depends on the> intensity of the exercise and its duration.”He also explains the consequences of substantially raising the duration andintensity of physical activity,> “It is now known that intense exercise dramatically increases free-radical> production and lipid peroxidation.”A dramatic increase in the production of free radicals can lead to oxidativestress and cause free radical damage, the underlying mechanism that isrecognised to be common to virtually all types of ‘disease’, including thosethat affect the cardiac system.Free radical damage is not an inevitable consequence of all forms of physicalactivity; it will only occur in the absence of an adequate level of antioxidantsthat can neutralise them. Unfortunately, most people, including elite athletes,are unaware that increased physical activity should be accompanied by anincreased intake of antioxidants. As Dr Blaylock explains, this lack ofawareness means that, when they increase their level of physical activity,> “…most people do not correspondingly increase their antioxidant intake.”Antioxidants are extremely important for providing protection against freeradical damage, but they are not the only group of nutrients essential forhealth. Another extremely important nutrient is magnesium, a deficiency of whichis also linked to cardiac problems, as Dr Carolyn Dean explains in The MagnesiumMiracle,> “Magnesium deficiency may cause sudden cardiac death in healthy adults.”It is clear therefore, that ‘fitness’ is not synonymous with ‘health’. Physicalactivity is beneficial, but it is vital that the body is in a state of ‘goodhealth’ prior to an increase in the level of physical activity, otherwise, asthis discussion has shown, it may be accompanied by serious health problems.Although an increased intake of nutrients, especially antioxidants, is animportant aspect of ‘good health’, it is not the only factor to which peopleneed to pay attention; as discussed in the remaining sections of this book.The Four FactorsIt has been asserted in previous discussions that conditions of ill-health arealways the result of multiple factors; an assertion that is recognised, albeitto a limited extent, in the Healthy Environments report, which acknowledgesthat,> “…the root causes of ill health are multifactorial…”The factors referred to in the report include many that cannot be described as‘causes’; whereas those discussed in the remaining sections of this chapter havebeen proven to be causal factors, because they induce the underlying mechanismcommon to all diseases.The medical establishment erroneously claims that the conditions of ill-healthreferred to as infectious diseases are caused by ‘biological factors’; in otherwords, pathogenic microorganisms. The conditions of ill-health referred to asnoncommunicable diseases are, however, claimed to result from a combination of‘risk factors’, which, according to the WHO fact sheet about NCDs, are genetic,physiological, behavioural and environmental.A ‘risk’ refers to the possibility that an effect may occur, whereas a ‘cause’is something that produces an effect; these terms are clearly not synonymous.The term ‘risk factor’ is defined on the WHO web page entitled Risk factors thatstates,> “A risk factor is any attribute, characteristic or exposure of an individual> that increases the likelihood of developing a disease or injury.”The reason that the medical establishment refers to ‘risk factors’ rather thancauses is due to their lack of knowledge about the exact causes of NCDs; butthis ‘knowledge gap’ is due entirely to their lack of understanding about thenature of ‘disease’ and the functions of the human body. The lack ofunderstanding about the latter can be demonstrated by the idea that ‘geneticfactors’ pose a significant risk to health; as Dr Bruce Lipton explains in hisFebruary 2012 article entitled Epigenetics,> “Conventional medicine is operating from an archaic view that we’re controlled> by genes. This misunderstands the nature of how biology works.”The claim that ‘environmental factors’ contribute to ill-health cannot bedisputed, although the medical establishment fails to acknowledge all of therelevant factors.The subtitle of the Healthy Environments report is: A global assessment of theburden of disease from environmental risks. The purpose of the report is toidentify the environmental factors associated with disease that are‘modifiable’, so that interventions can be implemented to reduce the overallburden of disease. Unfortunately, many of the interventions used for the purposeof reducing disease exacerbate rather than solve the problem. One particularlypertinent example is the use of highly toxic pesticides for the purpose oferadicating vectors, especially mosquitoes, which are claimed to transmitparasites that are said to cause various diseases, such as malaria.On the basis of the erroneous belief that ‘diseases’ are individual entities,the Healthy Environments report presents the results of its ‘assessment’ byreference to a number of diseases, each of which is considered separately in theeffort to identify the specific ‘environmental risks’ with which that disease isassociated. One of the listed diseases is ‘asthma’, a major determinant of whichis erroneously claimed to involve ‘genetic predisposition’. Although the reportcorrectly attributes a role to air pollution, it is only in the context that airpollution provokes and exacerbates asthma; which indicates that the conditionalready exists. It should be noted however, that many components of airpollution are known to cause oxidative stress and that a recognised associationexists between oxidative stress and asthma.Whilst the report acknowledges many ‘environmental risk factors’ that have beenassociated with various ‘diseases’, it fails to recognise the full range ofhazardous substances and influences or the full extent of their adverse effectson the environment. One of the reasons that the report fails to include all ofthe relevant ‘environmental factors’ is claimed to be because their ‘risk’ hasnot been fully assessed; as indicated by the statement that,> “There are many examples of risks that have not been adequately evaluated,> including the effects of emerging risks (e.g. more intensive agricultural> practices and zoonoses), the effects of many longterm chemical exposures on> cancers or endocrine disorders, and the impact of electromagnetic and other> exposures from new technologies.”This statement is disingenuous; many of the risks associated with chemical andelectromagnetic exposures have been evaluated and are known, as will be furtherdiscussed in this chapter; the main reasons that the medical establishmentdenies that they pose serious risks to health were discussed in chapter nine.The ‘new’ explanation of the nature of ‘disease’ states that disruptions to thebody’s ability to function properly are caused by exposures to ‘harmfulsubstances and influences’, although the body has innate mechanisms by which itcan protect itself. However, the ability of these mechanisms to functionproperly and protect the body, can be compromised if exposures to ‘harmfulsubstances and influences’ reach a substantially high level; which is preciselythe predicament now faced by the vast majority of the world population.It is, however, possible to improve this situation, but it requires people tohave the necessary information to enable them to take the appropriate actions;these actions involve reducing exposures to harmful substances and influences,and require attention to be paid to everything that is supportive of health. Allof the substances and influences that affect human health, whether beneficiallyor otherwise, can be identified as belonging to one of four categories, whichare referred to in the remaining sections of this chapter as ‘the four factors’;these are nutrition, toxic exposures, EM radiation exposures and stress.NutritionThe medical establishment acknowledges that ‘nutrition’ is important, but has apoor understanding of the full meaning of the term and of its importance tohealth. The WHO web page entitled Nutrition defines the term as,> “…the intake of food, considered in relation to the body’s dietary needs.”The real meaning of nutrition refers to far more than is included in thisdefinition, as this discussion will demonstrate.Although the Oxford Concise Medical Dictionary defines ‘nutrition’ withreference to the intake of nutrients, it defines a nutrient as,> “a substance that must be consumed as part of the diet to provide a source of> energy, material for growth or substances that regulate growth or energy> production.”This definition highlights one of the major, but erroneous, ideas promulgated bythe medical establishment about nutrition, which is that the main purpose offood is to provide the body with ‘energy’; as also demonstrated by the WHONutrition web page, which defines ‘good nutrition’ as,> “…an adequate, well-balanced diet combined with regular physical activity…”Physical activity is not a component of ‘good nutrition’. The reason for itsinclusion in the definition is to promote the idea that an ‘adequate’ diet isone that provides sufficient calories to meet, but not exceed, the body’srequirement for energy to be expended in physical activity; as indicated by theWHO October 2018 Healthy diet fact sheet which claims that,> “Energy intake (calories) should be in balance with energy expenditure.”A diet that is focused on the energy value of foods is not synonymous with a‘healthy diet’, nor does it represent ‘good nutrition’. The claim that energyintake should balance energy expenditure is based on the notion that an intakeof calories that exceeds those expended in physical activity is the main causeof overweight and obesity; as indicated by the February 2018 WHO fact sheetentitled Obesity and overweight that states,> “The fundamental cause of obesity and overweight is an energy imbalance> between calories consumed and calories expended.”Overweight and obesity are defined in the fact sheet by reference to theaccumulation of body fat. But body fat does not accumulate solely as the resultof an excess intake of calories; it is far more closely and causally related tothe quality of the foods consumed. The fact sheet explains that overweight andobesity are determined by reference to a measurement known as BMI (body massindex). For adults, overweight is defined as a BMI between 25 and 30, whereasobesity is defined as a BMI of 30 or higher; the criteria for children aredifferent and dependent on their age.The most significant aspect of a high BMI is that it is associated with anincreased ‘risk’ of developing an NCD; as indicated by the fact sheet thatclaims,> “Raised BMI is a major risk factor for noncommunicable diseases…”The main NCDs associated with a high BMI are cardiovascular disease, diabetesand certain cancers, but these conditions are not caused by an excess intake ofcalories. In accordance with the ‘new’ explanation of disease, these conditionsrepresent different manifestations of dysfunctions within the body, due toexposures to ‘harmful substances and influences’ that increase the generation offree radicals, induce oxidative stress and result in damage to the body’s cellsand tissues.The emphasis by the medical establishment on the energy value of foods islargely based on the mechanistic view of the body that promotes the idea thatthe human requirement for food is analogous to a vehicle’s requirement for fuel.But this is a false analogy; the human body is not mechanistic in nature.Although there is a need to consume foods that provide the necessary materialsfor conversion into energy, the human body is a living organism whose complexlife-sustaining processes bear no resemblance whatsoever to the purelymechanical functions of machines, including those produced using the mostadvanced technologies.The fundamental purpose of eating is to provide the body with the necessarymaterials to support all of its processes, not merely those that involve theproduction of energy. Substances consumed as food should therefore contain thosenecessary materials, more commonly referred to as nutrients. This means that‘nutrition’ should be more correctly defined as the intake of nutrients andtheir transformation into materials for utilisation in the body’s biochemicalprocesses that promote health and sustain life; as summarised by Herbert Sheltonwho explains that,> “To serve in any proper sense as food a substance must be capable of> assimilation by the tissues; this is to say, the cells must be able to take it> up from the blood stream and incorporate it into themselves and make it a> normal constituent of cell substance and use it in the processes of life.”Any substance that cannot be transformed into materials that the body canutilise is not a nutrient; a substance that is unusable by the body will beantagonistic to it and must therefore be regarded as a ‘poison’, as he alsoexplains,> “Any substance that cannot be so appropriated by the cells and organized into> living structure, this is to say, any substance that cannot be metabolized, is> a poison.”Although the WHO refers to good nutrition as ‘a cornerstone of good health’, itnevertheless fails to recommend policies that would make nutrition a cornerstoneof healthcare. One of the reasons for this failure is due to the influence ofvested interests, especially of the chemical, pharmaceutical and foodindustries, whose profitability would be threatened by increased publicawareness of the true meaning of nutrition.Furthermore, most members of the medical establishment are reluctant to improvetheir knowledge about ‘nutrition’ because, as previously discussed, the topic isconsidered to be ‘unscientific’, ‘fluffy’ and the ‘realm of dieticians notdoctors’. The perpetuation of this disparaging attitude is largely due to thevirtual absence of nutrition courses in the curricula of most medical schools.This is, however a serious omission; understanding nutrition is fundamental toan understanding of human health, which, according to the medical establishment,is the indisputable ‘realm of doctors’. However, medical researchers do notunderstand health because they study ‘disease’, or more accurately, they studythe effects of disease; but their investigations are based on an erroneousunderstanding of the nature of the phenomenon that they study.Another reason for the perpetuation of such a disparaging attitude towards thetopic is because a genuine study of nutrition involves a different approach fromthat employed by ‘modern medicine’; as indicated by Dr T Colin Campbell PhD who,in his 2017 article entitled Nutritional Renaissance and Public Health Policy,states that,> “Nutrition is a wholistic science whereas medical practice is reductionist, a> serious mismatch that causes biased judgement of nutrition.”This reductionist approach is widespread throughout modern medicine; this can beseen by the fact that there are many different specialist fields that each focuson a separate part of the body or on a single disease. It is thereforeunsurprising that the medical establishment studies individual nutrients on thebasis of the idea that they each function independently; but this too is aserious error.The development of microscopes with increased lens magnification that enabledscientists to discover the fundamental components of ‘matter’, also facilitatedthe study of foods, which were discovered to be comprised of the substancesknown as nutrients, of which there are two main categories. Nutrients that arerequired by the body in relatively large amounts are referred to asmacronutrients, of which there are three types; namely, carbohydrates, fats andproteins. Nutrients that are required in comparatively small amounts are calledmicronutrients, of which there are two types; namely, vitamins and minerals.Carbohydrates, a group that comprises starches, sugars and fibre, are found in awide variety of foods. They are referred to as the body’s main source of energy,because most carbohydrates are broken down during the digestive processes andconverted into sugars, the main type of which is glucose, also known as bloodsugar, that is used or stored according to the body’s energy needs. Althoughsugars are a form of carbohydrate, they are not all the same nor are they allprocessed by the body in the same way, as discussed in chapter six. However, itis important to emphasise that the processes that convert carbohydrates intoglucose and release glucose into the bloodstream are tightly controlled by thebody’s self-regulating mechanisms; but these mechanisms can be disrupted by theconsumption of certain carbohydrates, especially refined carbohydrates andsugars.Sucrose, or refined sugar, is a manufactured substance that is a commoningredient of processed food products and has been associated with manyconditions of ill-health, including diabetes. The consumption of sucrosedisrupts the body’s normal control mechanisms and causes a surge in the level ofsugar released into the bloodstream. It is widely acknowledged that this ‘sugarsurge’ increases the generation of free radicals that can lead to oxidativestress and free radical damage, the underlying mechanism common to most, if notall, chronic health problems, including diabetes.The problems with refined sugars were discussed in chapter six, but it isimportant to reiterate that the recommendation to reduce the intake of ‘freesugars’ does not apply to the natural fructose found in fresh foods, especiallyfruits and vegetables.Starches are found in some vegetables but mostly in grains; they are thecarbohydrates common to most staple foods, such as bread, pasta, rice, corn andpotatoes. They are also the main form of carbohydrates that are converted intoglucose and therefore constitute a major source of calorie intake. It is forthis reason that starch-based foods are usually minimised, or even avoided, bypeople who wish to lose weight by reducing their calorie intake.This is yet another example of the misplaced focus on the calorific value offoods rather than their nutritional value. A far more important quality ofstarch-based foods that should be considered is whether they have been refinedor not. In common with all forms of processing, the ‘refining’ of grainssubstantially reduces their nutritional content to the extent that most havelittle, if any, remaining nutritional content. Rice, for example, is refined bythe removal of the husk, bran and germ, but these are the parts that containvirtually all of the nutrients; refined rice is therefore almost entirely devoidof any nutritional value.Many refined grains, such as wheat, and the products with which they are made,such as breads, are then ‘fortified’ to replace the nutrients lost inprocessing; but, for reasons discussed later in this section, the nutritionalcontent is not improved through fortification with individual nutrients. Mostrefining processes also deplete grains of their fibre, which is anotherextremely important component as it provides the roughage necessary for properdigestion. There is, however, an increasing acknowledgement that whole grainsare healthier than refined grains; even the WHO Healthy diet fact sheet refersto the inclusion of whole grains as part of a healthy diet.Proteins, the second category of macronutrients, are comprised of amino acids,some of which are synthesised by the body, although others, referred to asessential amino acids, are not and must therefore be obtained from the diet.Animal-based foods, such as meat and dairy products, are rich sources of proteinand believed to be the body’s main, if not only, source of protein. On the basisof the erroneous belief that humans are ‘natural’ meat-eaters, a topic that willbe discussed later in this section, it is claimed that diets that exclude animalfoods will be protein deficient. This is, however, an erroneous claim; asindicated by a 2013 article entitled Nutritional Update for Physicians:Plant-Based Diets, which states that,> “Generally, patients on a plant-based diet are not at risk for protein> deficiency.”Although the article defines a ‘plant-based diet’ as one that minimises ratherthan avoids the consumption of animal foods, it nevertheless, recommends thatphysicians encourage their patients to increase their consumption of plantfoods.It is important to note that a fully plant-based diet, in other words, one thattotally excludes animal foods, is perfectly capable of fulfilling the humanrequirement for protein. Furthermore, in his book entitled The China Study, TColin Campbell refers to a significant volume of compelling research which showsthat,> “…plant protein, which allows for slow but steady synthesis of new proteins,> is the healthiest type of protein.”Fats, the third category of macronutrients, are important components of thediet, even though they are notoriously high in calories. However, like the othermacronutrients, fats have also been the subject of misleading information, themost significant of which relates to the association between the intake of fats,raised cholesterol levels and increased ‘risks’ to health. Although the mistakenideas about ‘good’ and ‘bad’ cholesterol were discussed in chapter one, it mustbe reiterated that cholesterol is essential for many of the body’s functions,and that most of the body’s cholesterol is produced by the liver. It is alsoimportant to repeat that the health problems claimed to be associated with highcholesterol levels are not caused by ‘bad’ cholesterol, but by oxidisedcholesterol. In his 2006 book, Health and Nutrition Secrets, Dr Russell Blaylockstates that,> “More than fifteen years ago it was discovered that cholesterol is not> dangerous unless it is oxidised…”The reason that LDL cholesterol has been designated as the ‘bad’ form is becauseit is easier to oxidise than HDL cholesterol. As discussed in chapter seven, DrBlaylock explains that cholesterol is oxidised by free radicals and that,> “…oxidized HDL cholesterol is just as dangerous as oxidised LDL cholesterol.”The most unhealthy types of fat are hydrogenated fats and industrially-producedtrans-fats; as indicated by the WHO Healthy diet fact sheet which states thatthese fats,> “…are not part of a healthy diet and should be avoided.”It should be noted that these fats are only found in industrially-producedprocessed food products; they are therefore easy to avoid.The fact sheet also recommends that the intake of saturated fats, which arealmost exclusively found in animal foods, is reduced. The suggested ways toachieve this reduction include the replacement of full-fat dairy foods withreduced-fat versions; but these are not necessarily healthier options becausethe removal of the fat content requires additional processing, which furtherreduces the overall nutritional content.Another suggested method by which the intake of saturated fats can be reduced isthe replacement of fats such as butter, lard and ghee, with polyunsaturatedfats, such as soybean, canola, safflower and sunflower oils, on the basis thatthey are healthier; but this too is not necessarily the case. Some of these oilsare produced from GM crops; this is particularly the case with respect to oilsmade from soybeans, which are one of the most common GM crops. Furthermore,these oils, which are often described as ‘refined’, are usually produced byindustrial processes that subject the crops to harmful chemicals in theextraction of the oil.Oils can be produced by methods that do not involve GM crops or harmfulchemicals and are therefore healthier; cold pressing, for example, is the methodcommonly used to produce oils such as olive and coconut oils. Although there arerecommendations that even these oils should be avoided because of their fatcontent, this advice is based on the erroneous idea that all forms of ‘fat’raise cholesterol to a dangerous level.It is clear from the foregoing that plant foods are excellent sources of allthree macronutrients; but they are also vital sources of micronutrients, whichthe WHO web page entitled Micronutrients refers to as,> “…the ‘magic wands’ that enable the body to produce enzymes, hormones and> other substances essential for proper growth and development.”One of the essential roles of micronutrients, with particular reference to theunderlying mechanism of all forms of ‘disease’, is to act as antioxidants andtherefore protect the body from oxidative stress and the resulting free radicaldamage; as Dr Russell Blaylock explains in Health and Nutrition Secrets,> “... most of us are familiar with vitamin antioxidants such as vitamin A,> beta-carotene, vitamin C, and vitamin E. All are powerful antioxidants that> neutralize a significant number of free-radicals. Less well-known antioxidants> are vitamins D and K, magnesium, zinc and manganese. Also, there are over> forty carotenoids and five thousand flavonoids from plants in the human diet> that act as antioxidants.”He explains that all of these antioxidants are important for the body because,> “Each antioxidant acts in a different place in the cells and tissues.”Although the identification of different micronutrients has facilitated acertain level of understanding of nutrition, the study of individual nutrientsand their functions is a perfect example of the reductionist approach thatprevails within the medical establishment and, to a certain extent, the‘alternative health’ community, many of whom also promote the health benefits ofindividual nutrients. The main consequence of this approach has been to ignorethe wholeness of foods and to only consider their individual fragmentedcomponents. This is, however, a serious mistake; in the case of food, the wholeis definitely far greater than the sum of its parts.Nevertheless, the study of the individual nutrient components of foods has ledto ideas that a deficiency in a single nutrient can lead to specific healthproblems; the WHO, for example, claims on the web page entitled Micronutrientdeficiencies that,> “Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is the leading cause of preventable blindness in> children…”Other ‘diseases’ have also been associated with specific nutrient deficiencies;scurvy, for example, is claimed to be caused by a severe vitamin C deficiency.However, the ‘new’ explanation of disease demonstrates that scurvy can be moreaccurately described as a condition that results from oxidative stress and freeradical damage due to a severe antioxidant deficiency. This can be seen by thefact that scurvy can be resolved by the addition of citrus fruits such as limesor lemons to the diet. As discussed below, foods contain complex mixtures ofnutrients; which means that deficiency diseases can never be due to a deficiencyof only one single type of nutrient.It is increasingly recognised that the ‘modern diet’, meaning one comprisedmainly, if not entirely of manufactured processed food products and drinks, isunable to supply all of the micronutrients essential for health. However, it isbelieved that this problem can be solved through the use of dietary supplementsthat supply ‘missing’ nutrients. But this is an erroneous belief for manyreasons, one of which is that it is virtually impossible to test for individualnutritional deficiencies. But even if a deficiency of a particular nutrientcould be ascertained, the problem cannot be solved by chemical compoundssynthesised in a laboratory. Although the dietary supplements industry justifiesthe use of synthetic chemicals on the basis that they are ‘chemically identical’to the nutrients that occur naturally in foods, this is grossly misleading. Theproblem with vitamin supplements is explained by Dr Robert Thiel PhD in hisarticle entitled The Truth About Vitamins in Supplements, in which he statesthat,> “The truth is that most vitamins in supplements are made or processed with> petroleum derivatives or hydrogenated sugars.”In his article entitled Food Antioxidants are Superior to Isolated Antioxidants,he further explains that, even if they were chemically similar, the vitamins inmanufactured supplements are structurally different from those found in foods.An even more important fact is that the vitamins in foods are always accompaniedby ‘other elements’ that are necessary for the absorption of the nutrients intothe body’s cells, but are entirely absent from supplements. The vitamins insupplements are therefore incomplete nutrients, as Dr Thiel explains,> “Isolated, non-food vitamins, even when not chemically different are only> fractionated nutrients.”Although certain vitamin supplements are claimed to be ‘food-based’, these toolack all of the ‘other elements’ that occur naturally in foods and are essentialfor the proper functioning of nutrients. The importance of these ‘otherelements’ cannot be overstated; their absence is a major obstacle that preventssupplements from being able to confer any significant health benefits. It is forthis reason that research studies, which investigate the effects of individualnutrients by conducting experiments with synthetic chemical compounds,invariably report few, if any beneficial health effects.These problems are not exclusive to vitamin supplements; they also apply tomineral supplements, as Dr Thiel explains in his article entitled The TruthAbout Minerals in Nutritional Supplements,> “The truth about nearly all minerals in supplements is that they are really> industrial chemicals made from processing rocks with one or more acids.”The human body is unable to digest rock minerals, which are rejected as unusableand expelled from the body; supplements of this nature are therefore entirelyuseless. Plants, by comparison, are perfectly able to absorb natural rockminerals and convert them into a form that is suitable for digestion, absorptionand assimilation by the human body when plants are consumed. It is for thisreason that plants are the only sources of minerals that the human body canabsorb, as Herbert Shelton states,> “We have to draw our mineral nutrients exclusively from the plant kingdom and> not from the soil.”In order to function effectively, minerals also require the presence of ‘otherelements’, including other minerals that must be in the right form and in theright balance with respect to each other. The importance of this relativebalance can be demonstrated by reference to the relationship between calcium andmagnesium. Calcium is known to be essential for healthy bones, but itseffectiveness also requires the presence of vitamin D, as indicated by the NHSweb page entitled Food for strong bones that states,> “You need sufficient calcium to strengthen your bones and vitamin D to help> your body absorb calcium.”On the basis of this need for adequate calcium, people are advised to ensuretheir diet includes a good supply of calcium-rich foods, especially milk anddairy products. But a high intake of calcium alone is unable to strengthenbones, even in the presence of adequate levels of vitamin D. The reason is thatthe absorption of calcium into the bone also requires adequate levels ofmagnesium, which the NHS web page clearly fails to mention. Nevertheless, DrCarolyn Dean explains in The Magnesium Miracle that,> “Adequate levels of magnesium are essential for the absorption and metabolism> of calcium.”Most diets provide a sufficient intake of calcium, but rarely provide sufficientmagnesium. The inevitable result of the regular consumption of amagnesium-deficient diet will be an imbalance between the relative levels ofcalcium and magnesium; an imbalance that can have many potentially harmfulconsequences for health. A high level of calcium that is not readily absorbedinto bone due to insufficient magnesium can result in a build-up of calcium inthe blood, which can cause kidney stones. If the level of calcium becomes veryhigh, it can lead to a condition known as hypercalcemia, which, although rare,can impair the normal functions of the brain and heart.Magnesium is therefore an extremely important mineral, but its functions are notlimited to assisting the absorption of calcium into bone; it is also associatedwith many other functions, as Dr Dean states,> “Magnesium regulates more than 325 enzymes in the body…”One of the main reasons that most diets are magnesium deficient is because thisessential mineral is depleted by all forms of processing; processed foodproducts will therefore be particularly low in magnesium. This deficiency can,however, be rectified by the consumption of magnesium-rich foods, as Dr Deanadvises,> “To enrich your diet with magnesium, increase your consumption of green> vegetables, nuts, seeds, legumes and unprocessed grains.”A similar relationship exists between sodium and potassium, both of which areimportant for the healthy functioning of cells, especially those of the heart.The WHO Healthy diet fact sheet recommends that the intake of salt is reduced inorder to lower the body’s sodium levels. But this is misleading; the body cannotmetabolise rock minerals and therefore does not absorb sodium from ‘table salt’.As discussed in chapter one, one of the main causes of elevated sodium levels isa deficiency of potassium. The medical establishment has, however, begun torecognise the importance of potassium in balancing the level of sodium; asindicated by the October 2018 WHO Healthy diet fact sheet which states that,> “Potassium can mitigate the negative effects of elevated sodium consumption on> blood pressure. Intake of potassium can be increased by consuming fresh fruit> and vegetables.”It is clear that an increased intake of fresh fruits, vegetables and other plantfoods will mitigate many health problems.Soil nutrient levels have unfortunately declined substantially over the past fewdecades in many parts of the world and this has inevitably reduced thenutritional content of the foods grown in such nutrient-poor soils; but thisproblem cannot be solved through the use of nutritional supplements or thefortification of foods. The only solution is to replenish the soil withnutrients. It is claimed that fertilisers perform the important task ofreplacing lost nutrients; but the products used by most industrial agriculturalpractices are NPK fertilisers, which means they only contain nitrogen, potassiumand phosphorus, and are therefore deficient in all of the other importantminerals, especially magnesium. However, the fact that they lack many essentialnutrients is not the only problem associated with these fertiliser products; thediscussion in chapter six referred to the sources of the phosphorus and nitrogenused by the fertiliser industry.In addition to the major minerals, are others that are required in such tinyamounts that they are referred to as ‘trace elements’. In 1996, the WHO produceda report entitled Trace elements in human nutrition and health, which, accordingto a web page with the same title, provides authoritative recommendations aboutnineteen trace elements divided into three categories. The page states that,> “These include essential elements, such as iodine and zinc, probably essential> elements, such as manganese and silicon, and potentially toxic elements, such> as fluoride, lead, cadmium and mercury, which may also have some essential> functions at low levels.”This report appears to be the most recent WHO publication on the topic of ‘traceelements’ but it is in urgent need of revision. An abundance of evidence hasaccumulated since 1996 that demonstrates unequivocally that fluoride, lead,cadmium and mercury are all definite rather than merely ‘potential’ toxins;there is also ample evidence that demonstrates none of them has any ‘essentialfunction’ in the human body at any level.It should be clear that a reductionist approach to nutrition is entirely wrongbecause the focus on individual nutrients ignores the importance of thewholeness of foods; as indicated by Herbert Shelton who states in his bookentitled The Science and Fine Art of Natural Hygiene that,> “All of this modern attention to separate food factors—proteins,> carbohydrates, fats, minerals, vitamins, etc.—amounts to fragmentation of what> should be something whole and sound, accessible to us without our having to> take thought.”The nutrients contained in different foods, although in varying amounts andcombinations, are always accompanied by all of the necessary ‘other elements’that enable them to perform their function, which is to support the body’sprocesses that maintain health as well as sustain life, as Dr Blaylock explains,> “There is growing evidence that it is the combined effects of these complex> nutrients – not single nutrients – that provide us with such memorable health> benefits.”The reason that foods provide such health benefits is because the nutrients theycontain function synergistically, as indicated by Dr Campbell who, in hispreviously cited Nutritional Renaissance article, states that,> “The wholeness of food illustrates how nutrients working collectively and> dynamically, create health.”Another misleading idea, which is based on the exhortation by Hippocrates to‘let thy food be thy medicine’, is that certain foods have ‘medicinalproperties’. Some foods, for example, are claimed to be ‘natural antibiotics’;but this is an erroneous claim. The human body is the natural home of trillionsof bacteria, most of which reside in the digestive system where they assist thedigestive processes. This not only means that real foods do not kill bacteria,but that substances that do kill bacteria cannot be referred to as ‘foods’.Although some are claimed to be particularly beneficial for health, foods do notact as ‘medicine’; as Herbert Shelton states,> “…in no sense can foods be regarded as medicinal. Foods are nutritive> substances…”Foods therefore, do not kill germs, ‘heal’ the body or ‘cure’ any disease.Healing is a biological process that is solely performed by the body, whoseinnate self-healing mechanisms are supported by the nutrients obtained fromfoods.One of the consequences of the reductionist approach to nutrition, together withthe belief that ‘everything is made from chemicals’, has been that the foodindustry has been permitted to use synthetic chemicals as ingredients of theirproducts, and as food additives to perform certain ‘technological functions’.However, despite the claim that they are ‘chemically identical’ to the elementsfound in a food, no industrially-produced compound can reproduce a product ofnature in exactly the same form as that provided by nature; as Herbert Sheltonexplains,> “It is possible to analyze an apple and ascertain its chemical constituents;> but all the chemists in the world cannot make an apple, nor anything that can> substitute for it.”Nevertheless, the WHO approves the use of chemical substances in food productson the proviso that they meet the standards set by the Codex AlimentariusCommission. Although previously cited in chapter six, the definition of a ‘foodadditive’, according to Codex standard STAN 192-1995, deserves repetition; itstates,> “Food additive means any substance not normally consumed as a food by itself> and not normally used as a typical ingredient of the food, whether or not it> has nutritive value...”A substance that is not normally consumed as a food or has no nutritive valuecannot be described as a ‘food’. As stated earlier in this discussion, asubstance that is not a nutrient will be antagonistic to the body and should,more accurately, be described as a ‘poison’. Nevertheless, the WHO, which claimsto be the authority for public health, permits the use of ‘poisons’ on the basisthat they are deemed ‘safe’ according to JECFA. However, as discussed in chaptersix, ‘safe’ is a relative term that means the substance is regarded as safeprovided it does not exceed the recommended usage level.Real foods are inherently safe; their safety can only be compromised if theyhave been contaminated by toxic substances. However, even if uncontaminated,real foods may cause digestive discomfort, but this will only occur if anexcessive amount has been consumed, as Herbert Shelton explains,> “The overconsumption of the best foods will produce trouble.”This ‘trouble’ may include pain and discomfort, which are the body’s signals tocease eating so that the over-extended digestive system can process the foodalready consumed. It is inappropriate to interpret these symptoms to mean thatthe food has become a ‘poison’ due to the consumption of a large dose.Food additives, by comparison, are inherently toxic due to the nature of theiringredients, but the consumption of foods that contain additives may notimmediately produce an effect, because the additive may be at a sufficiently lowlevel that the body is able to process and expel it. However, the ability totolerate toxins will differ according to each individual and their state ofhealth.The body’s reactions to the consumption of foods containing toxic substances maybe dramatic and involve symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhoea, or they mayinvolve symptoms that are commonly associated with ‘allergies’; the problemswith the attribution of symptoms to a ‘food allergy’ were discussed in chapterseven. However, it is not insignificant that there is an increased incidence ofallergies that correlates with the increased use of toxic chemicals inagriculture and food production. It may be argued that this correlation is notproof of causation, but this is an inappropriate argument, because there is anabundance of evidence that undeniably shows direct links between allergies,exposures to toxic substances, oxidative stress and illness. The problems withtoxins are discussed in more detail later in the chapter.In addition to the acknowledgement by the WHO on the Nutrition web page that‘good nutrition’ is an important component of ‘good health’, is theacknowledgement that ‘poor nutrition’ is related to ‘poor health’; as indicatedby the statement that,> “Poor nutrition can lead to reduced immunity, increased susceptibility to> disease, impaired physical and mental development, and reduced productivity.”Although ‘poor nutrition’ is often equated to ‘underfed’, these terms are notsynonymous; as previously discussed, people who are well-fed can also sufferfrom ‘poor nutrition’, or ‘malnutrition’ as it is also called. This isparticularly the case when the diet is one that is almost entirely comprised ofprocessed food products and drinks that are low in nutrients, even though theymay be high in calories. The WHO recognises that ‘malnutrition’ can be caused bynutrient deficiencies; as indicated by the previously cited WHO Malnutritionfact sheet that states,> “Malnutrition refers to deficiencies, excesses, or imbalances in a person’s> intake of energy and/or nutrients.”This statement is however, misleading with reference to excesses in the intakeof nutrients; as the discussions about carbohydrates, proteins and fats havedemonstrated, it is not the quantity but the quality of these macronutrientsthat is most important to health. Furthermore, the claim that malnutrition canoccur due to an insufficient intake of ‘energy’, meaning calories, is erroneous;‘calories’ are not nutrients.People who consume large quantities of processed foods that are high in caloriesbut low in nutrients may, however, continue to feel hungry, but this is notbecause the body craves ‘more food’; instead, the feeling of ‘hunger’ is morelikely to indicate a craving for nutrients; as Dr Carolyn Dean explains,> “Food craving and overeating can be simply a desire to continue eating past> fullness because the body is, in fact, craving nutrients that are missing from> processed food.”According to the Malnutrition fact sheet, one of the forms of malnutrition is‘undernutrition’, which is claimed to have four sub-forms, namely, wasting,stunting, underweight and deficiencies in vitamins and minerals. But‘undernutrition’ by definition refers to an inadequate intake of nutrients;which means that wasting, stunting and underweight are the result of‘undernutrition’, not different sub-forms of it.Another ‘form’ of malnutrition is referred to as ‘protein-energy malnutrition’,which is described in a WHO document entitled Global burden of protein-energymalnutrition in the year 2000 that states,> “Protein-energy malnutrition is a nutritional deficiency resulting from either> inadequate energy (caloric) or protein intake and manifesting in either> marasmus or kwashiorkor.”"},{"pageContent":"Protein is especially important for growth and development and is thereforeessential for the diets of young children. However, ‘malnutrition’ cannot beattributed to a single nutrient deficiency; as discussed earlier in thissection, foods provide a wide variety of different nutrients, bothmicronutrients as well as macronutrients, all of which are essential, not onlyfor growth and development but for other functions. Unfortunately, theinterventions provided by the WHO and other aid agencies in order to help solvethe interrelated problems of hunger and undernutrition, involve the distributionof certain pre-packaged ‘food products’. As discussed in chapter eight, one ofthese products is called RUTF (ready-to-use therapeutic food). The UNICEF webpage entitled Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food for Children With Severe AcuteMalnutrition describes RUTF as energy-dense pastes that have been enriched withmicronutrients and states that,> “Typical primary ingredients for RUTF include peanuts, oil, sugar, milk> powder, and vitamin and mineral supplements.”Although products like RUTF may provide temporary relief from acute starvation,they do not provide the solution to ‘undernutrition’. The description of theseproducts as ‘energy-dense’ means that they are high in calories, but that doesnot mean that they are nutrient-dense. The typical primary ingredients of RUTF,as listed above, do not contain the wide range of essential micronutrients,especially antioxidants, that are necessary to protect the body from freeradical damage. The increased susceptibility to disease that is recognised to beassociated with malnutrition, can only be addressed by providing peoplesuffering from malnutrition with real foods that are rich in all of thenutrients, not just those that provide energy. Furthermore, the addition ofsupplements to these products will not resolve the nutritional deficiencies oftheir primary ingredients.Nutritional supplements are frequently taken in the absence of any test todetermine the nature of the deficiency or even if any deficiency actuallyexists; it should be noted that no test can determine the body’s nutritionalstatus, as many nutrients are retained in organs and tissues that cannot betested. One of the main reasons that people take supplements is to boost theirintake of vitamins and minerals on the basis of the health benefits they areclaimed to confer. Yet rarely do people realise that their nutritional intakewould receive a far greater boost if they improved their diet; the main reasonthat many people are reluctant to make fundamental changes to their diet issuggested by Dr Campbell, who, in his previously cited 2017 article, statesthat,> “A major reason why isolated nutrients, as supplements, are still used by the> public is the false assumption (or excuse?) that we can retain the desired> health while continuing to eat our favorite foods, however unhealthy they may> be.”It should be clear from this discussion that the only real source of thenutrients required by the body is food, especially fresh, whole, plant-basedfoods that have not been subjected to toxic chemicals, such as pesticides, orunnatural processes, such as genetic modification. These are the types of foodsthat comprise a healthy diet. However, although referred to as a ‘diet’, theregular consumption of nutrient-rich foods should not be regarded as a temporarymeasure to attain a particular goal, but as a new and healthy way of living, asDr Henry Bieler explains in Food is Your Best Medicine,> “For proper food is not just for the health faddist but is, when you are aware> of the facts, truly a way of life.”The ubiquitous use of synthetic chemicals means that it is almost impossible toensure that foods are entirely chemical-free, but it is possible to minimiseexposures by choosing to consume produce that has been grown organically.Exposures to toxic substances can also be reduced by avoiding processed foodproducts and drinks that almost inevitably contain chemical additives. Theincreased demand for healthy foods has led some manufacturers to produce foodsthat contain fewer unhealthy ingredients; it is therefore important to readproduct labels to make healthy choices.The healthiest diet is, however, one that is comprised of fresh, whole,unprocessed, organic plant-based foods, as Dr Blaylock suggests,> “In truth, the only way to protect yourself and your family is to eat only> fresh foods that have no additives.”As briefly mentioned earlier in this section, it is widely believed and commonlyargued that humans are natural omnivores; the main justification for thisargument is the existence of prehistoric hunter-gatherer societies in many partsof the world. This argument can, however, be refuted by three counter-arguments.Firstly, the fact that prehistoric peoples ate meat only proves the existence ofa behaviour that has become a habit, it does not prove that the behaviour isnatural. Secondly, many societies around the world have an equallylong-established habit of abstaining from eating animal foods, in addition towhich are the many millions of people today who continue to not only survive,but thrive on a meat-free diet; which demonstrates unequivocally that meat isnot an essential component of the human diet. The third, and most compelling,refutation of the idea that humans are natural meat-eaters argues from theperspective of human anatomy and physiology, rather than human behaviours andhabits.A comparison of certain aspects of human anatomy and physiology with those ofcarnivores, omnivores and herbivores demonstrates a number of differences, themost significant of which occur within the digestive system. Whilst similaritiesexist between the digestive systems of carnivores and omnivores, they are bothsignificantly different from the human digestive system. The only reason forthese differences must be related to the foods the digestive system is capableof processing.It is clear that, despite the passage of many hundreds of thousands of years,humans have not ‘evolved’ to become natural meat-eaters, because the humandigestive system has not adapted to become more like that of carnivores andomnivores that can easily process meat.Although it is sometimes suggested that humans are more akin to herbivores, thistoo is incorrect, as the human digestive system cannot process the cellulosefound in many of the plants, especially grasses, that are consumed byherbivores. The diet most suited to humans, because it is most suited to humananatomy and physiology, is a frugivorous one; as indicated by Herbert Shelton,who states in his book entitled The Hygienic System: Vol II Orthotrophy that,> “The number and structure of his teeth, the length and structure of his> digestive tract, the position of his eyes, the character of his nails, the> functions of his skin, the character of his saliva, the relative size of his> liver, the number and position of the milk glands, the position and structure> of the sexual organs, the character of the human placenta and many other> factors all bear witness to the fact that man is constitutionally a> frugivore.”The term ‘frugivore’ aptly describes a diet comprised of fruits, vegetables,nuts and seeds; however, it also includes other parts of plants, as he furtherexplains,> “As there are no pure frugivores, all frugivores eating freely of green leaves> and other parts of plants, man may, also, without violating his constitutional> nature, partake of green plants. These parts of plants possess certain> advantages, as has been previously pointed out, in which fruits are deficient.> Actual tests have shown that the addition of green vegetables to the fruit and> nut diet improves the diet.”The term frugivore has not however, been widely adopted, except by people whofollow the practices of Natural Hygiene. People who eat neither meat nor fishbut do eat dairy foods are vegetarians, whereas people who abstain entirely fromanimal and dairy foods are vegans. However, vegetarian and vegan diets are notnecessarily ‘healthy’ because they do not automatically preclude the consumptionof processed food products. The term ‘whole food plant-based’ may also be usedto describe this type of diet. Whatever label may be chosen to best describe it,the healthiest type of diet is one that includes a wide variety of fresh, whole,unprocessed, plant-based foods that have not been genetically modified orexposed to toxic chemicals.Also important is that foods should be minimally processed, if at all, becauseall forms of processing, including cooking, reduce their nutritional content;this means that, where possible, foods should be consumed raw, as HerbertShelton indicates,> “It is almost axiomatic that fruits, nuts and vegetables are the only foods> that can be relished raw.”It is also axiomatic that a diet that contains a variety of these foods will beone that provides the human body with the nutrition required to ensure optimalfunctioning, and thereby ensure good health. But the attainment of good healthalso requires attention to be paid to the fluids consumed.Water is an essential component of the body’s cells; its presence in the body inadequate amounts is therefore vital, not only for health but for survival.The body loses fluids throughout the day due to normal bodily functions such asrespiration and excretion. If lost fluids are not replaced, the body’s cells andtissues will soon become dehydrated, which, if prolonged, will lead to impairedfunctioning of many vital organs, especially the kidneys, and can eventuallylead to death.In his book entitled Your Body’s Many Cries for Water, Dr F Batmanghelidj MDrefers to chronic cellular dehydration and claims that it is the main cause ofmost chronic health conditions. However, although dehydration may be acontributory factor, it cannot be regarded as the main cause of chronicconditions, which are always the result of a combination of some, if not all, ofthe ‘four factors’ discussed in this chapter. Significantly, from theperspective of the ‘new’ explanation of disease, dehydration causes the body tobecome ‘stressed’, which increases the generation of free radicals that caninduce oxidative stress and lead to free radical damage, the underlyingmechanism common to virtually all conditions of ill-health, especially chronicconditions.It is generally asserted that the human body requires a daily intake ofapproximately 6 to 8 glasses of fluids; there are, however, differing opinionsabout which beverages can be included in those fluids. Dr Batmanghelidj, forexample, advises that the daily intake should be comprised solely of water inorder to ensure that the body is fully hydrated.By contrast, the British Nutrition Foundation (BNF) states that consuming wateris a ‘good choice’, but that it is not necessary to only consume water because,> “Other drinks such as squash, fruit juice, fizzy drinks, tea and coffee> contribute to our daily requirements too.”This statement is highly misleading, but illustrative of the poor level ofknowledge about nutrition promulgated by organisations that claim to be in aposition to educate the public on the subject. On the BNF web page entitledHealthy hydration guide, it is acknowledged that fizzy drinks and squashescontain sugar and that their consumption should be minimised, but it isnevertheless claimed that these sugary drinks can be replaced by ‘diet’versions; the problems with the artificial sweeteners used to replace sugar infoods and drinks have been discussed. Furthermore, although tea and coffeecontain water, they both have a diuretic effect, which increases the volume offluids lost to excretion and therefore increases the body’s fluid intakerequirement.It would therefore seem preferable that water is the main, if not the only,liquid consumed each day, as Dr Batmanghelidj advises; unfortunately, virtuallyall of the water made available for drinking is not as ‘clean’ as it ought tobe.According to the claims of the medical establishment, the main problem thataffects the cleanliness of drinking water is the presence of ‘germs’ that aresaid to cause a number of diseases that can be transmitted through contaminatedwater; as indicated by the February 2018 WHO fact sheet entitled Drinking-waterthat states,> “Contaminated water can transmit diseases such as diarrhoea, cholera,> dysentery, typhoid, and polio.”Although the WHO recognises faecal matter to be the main contaminant, it isclaimed that these ‘diseases’ are caused by ‘germs’ that infect people via thefaecal-oral route, and that it is the ‘germs’ that cause the symptoms associatedwith these diseases; it should be emphasised that diarrhoea is a symptom not adisease. These claims are however, disingenuous. Symptoms such as vomiting anddiarrhoea are not caused by any ‘germ’; instead, they are the body’s reactionsto toxic substances, such as faecally-contaminated water, and represent itsefforts to expel those toxins. The WHO claims that diarrhoeal diseases, whichare said to be mainly prevalent in ‘developing’ countries, are largely theresult of the inadequate management of water; as indicated by the statement inthe fact sheet that was cited in chapter six, but deserves repetition,> “Inadequate management of urban, industrial and agricultural wastewater means> the drinking-water of hundreds of millions of people is dangerously> contaminated or chemically polluted.”Yet water management systems that are claimed to be ‘adequate’ also supplyhundreds of millions of people with water that is contaminated and chemicallypolluted; some of the chemical pollutants are the substances used to ‘treat’water to make it ‘safe’, but again, safe is only a relative term. As discussedin chapters six and eight, most of the water made available for humanconsumption, especially through municipal water supplies, cannot be referred toas either safe or clean.The chemicals used to ‘purify’ water are claimed to be present in concentrationsthat are within the levels deemed to be safe; but these chemicals are inherentlytoxic as their purpose is to kill bacteria, which are living organisms. TheParacelsus fallacy that claims a substance is only a poison when it reaches acertain ‘dose’ therefore permits water to be poisoned. In addition to the toxicsubstances used to ‘purify’ water, are the many chemical contaminants,especially those produced by industrial and agricultural activities anddischarged as effluent, that remain in water, because water treatment systemsare unable to remove them.It is clear that the quality of water supplied as ‘drinking water’ is extremelypoor, as discussed in chapter six, despite claims that it is ‘safe’. There arehowever, solutions to the problem of the poor quality of drinking water that canbe applied in the home or workplace. These solutions involve the use of filtersor filtering systems that are able to remove some or even most of thecontaminants in water. This inevitably raises the question of why these filtersare not applied before the water is delivered to the public.One type of water filtering systems involves the use of reverse osmosis, whichis claimed to remove virtually all contaminants, including fluoride andpharmaceuticals, but also removes minerals from the water, which has led to somecontroversy about whether these systems can be considered beneficial or not.Water is represented by the chemical symbol H2O. Although this ‘pure’ form ofwater may be consumed for a short period of time to assist with detoxification,it is considered by many to be unsuitable for consumption for extended periodsof time or on a regular basis; however, in Orthotrophy Herbert Shelton statesthat,> “Fresh rain water and distilled water are best. Distilled water is not dead,> as some foolishly say it is. Pure water from a rock spring is excellent> drink.”The increasing level of air pollution means that rain water is no longer a goodsource of truly clean fresh water. The reason that ‘pure’ or distilled water isclaimed to be unsuitable for drinking is because it is devoid of minerals;however, Herbert Shelton refutes this claim in Orthotrophy in which he statesthat,> “It is said that the body needs the minerals dissolved in the water. That the> body needs minerals is certain, but it needs them, as previously shown, in the> form of organic salts and derives these from foods.”Although most information about fluid intake refers solely to liquids, somerecognise that many foods, especially fruits and vegetables, contain asignificant volume of water that contributes to the daily intake of fluids, asHerbert Shelton also states in Orthotrophy,> “Most green vegetables and fresh fruits contain a higher percentage of water> than the adult body. If the diet contains an abundance of these foods little> or no additional water will be required.”He adds that,> “Dr Alcott and others of the vegetarian school proved by direct experiments> that those who adopt an exclusively vegetable regimen and make a large> proportion of their diet consist of juicy fruits and succulent vegetables can> be healthfully sustained and nourished without water-drinking.”A frugivorous diet therefore not only provides the body with water, but thewater it provides is of a far superior quality to ‘treated’ water; as Dr HenryBieler states in Food is Your Best Medicine,> “The quality of water found in melons, papayas, raw carrots, cucumbers and> celery is distinctly more beneficial to the body than the chlorinated,> chemically processed and irritating fluid that too often comes from the> faucet.”However, unless people consume a wholly frugivorous diet, it will be necessaryto consume some additional fluids; but these fluids can be provided by healthydrinks, especially freshly-prepared, home-made fruit and vegetable juices. Thereare many different machines available that are able to extract juice from a widevariety of fruits and vegetables; it should be obvious from the discussion inthe previous section that, where possible, the fruits and vegetables to bejuiced should be organically grown to ensure that they have been minimallyexposed to toxic chemicals and have not been genetically modified.It should be clear that freshly-prepared juices from clean, organically-grownfruits and vegetables are far healthier than manufactured juices and juicedrinks, especially those that have been made from concentrates and contain highlevels of sugars or artificial sweeteners. It should be noted that packagedjuices and juice drinks will invariably have been pasteurised, a process thatfurther reduces their nutritional content. Freshly-prepared home-made juiceswill not only boost the body’s intake of fluids, they will also increase theintake of nutrients; fresh juices should, however, be consumed in addition towhole fruits and vegetables; they are not to be considered as substitutes forthese whole foods.Toxic ExposuresThe word ‘toxin’ is derived from the Greek word for poison, but its meaning hasbeen altered so that it only refers to a specific type of poison; as indicatedby the previously cited establishment definition that describes a toxin as,> “a poison produced by a living organism, especially by a bacterium.”There are a number of living organisms that can produce poison, the purpose ofwhich is either defensive, to protect themselves against predators, oroffensive, to incapacitate or kill their prey. Bacterial toxins, by contrast,are claimed to have an entirely different purpose, which is to cause disease; asindicated by a January 2019 article entitled Evolutionary Features in theStructure and Function of Bacterial Toxins, which states that,> “Bacterial toxigenesis is a major mechanism by which pathogenic bacteria> produce diseases.”The article acknowledges that toxins are only produced by some bacteria, butexposes yet another ‘knowledge gap’ in the statement that,> “It is still a mystery, however, as to why certain bacteria produce such> potent molecules while others do not.”This mystery will not, however, be solved whilst the medical research communitycontinues to adhere to the erroneous idea that any bacterium produces a ‘poison’with the sole purpose of causing disease, especially within the human body.The original Latin word for poison or poisonous substance is ‘virus’, thedefinition of which has been so completely altered that it now refersexclusively to an ‘infectious agent’. However, as previously discussed, theparticles referred to as ‘viruses’ are pieces of genetic material in a proteincoating that possess none of the properties required to justify theirdescription as either ‘alive’ or ‘infectious’.The theories that claim bacteria, viruses, or any other ‘germs’ to beresponsible for causing disease have been shown to contain many knowledge gaps,as well as a number of anomalies and contradictions. Yet, although the medicalestablishment acknowledges the existence of these gaps, anomalies andcontradictions, it fails to recognise that their combined effect is to pose achallenge to the veracity of those theories, and that this challenge is of sucha serious and fundamental nature that it completely undermines the existence ofthe phenomenon referred to as an ‘infectious disease’.One of the main reasons that the medical establishment continues to adhere tothe ‘germ theory’ involves the influence of vested interests, especially thosethat control the industries that produce, use and discharge ‘toxic substances’.The attribution of blame for a large number of diseases to so-called ‘pathogenicmicroorganisms’ is clearly of immense benefit to these industries, as itdeflects attention away from their hazardous activities and products. But, inreality, it is the continual exposure to these hazards that not only poses thereal threat to human health, but also endangers the lives of all livingorganisms.Although previously cited, it is useful to repeat that the establishmentdefinition of a poison refers to,> “any substance that irritates, damages, or impairs activity of the body’s> tissues.”It is also useful to compare this to the establishment definition of a‘disease’, which refers to,> “any bodily abnormality or failure to function properly…”It is clear that these establishment definitions highlight a strikingresemblance between the effects of a poison and ‘disease’. Unfortunately, thesignificance of this similarity is invariably obfuscated by reference to theParacelsus fallacy, which claims that everything is a poison in the appropriatedose; as indicated by the establishment definition of a ‘poison’ that alsostates,> “In large enough doses almost any substance acts as a poison, but the term is> usually reserved for substances such as arsenic, cyanide and strychnine, that> are harmful in relatively small amounts.”The idea that the dose determines whether a substance acts as a poison or not isgrossly mistaken; the dose of a substance cannot determine its fundamentalnature, as Herbert Shelton indicates in his 1968 article entitled What is aPoison? in which he states that,> “Poisons are such qualitatively and not merely quantitatively.”The dose of a poison does, however, determine the degree of harm it will cause.Although a low dose of a toxic substance may not appear to cause harm, this doesnot mean that no harm has occurred. One reason for an apparent absence of harmat a low dose is due to the body’s ability to expel toxins and repair damage;but this does not mean that the substance can be considered ‘safe’ at that lowdose. The degree of harm caused by a toxic substance also depends on the healthstatus of the individual person exposed to that substance; a circumstance thatis ignored by the medical establishment that operates according to themechanistic view of the human body. But this view is fatally flawed, as it failsto acknowledge the existence of the body’s innate self-protective andself-healing mechanisms; it also ignores the uniqueness of each individualperson with respect to their health status and their existing body burden oftoxins.Furthermore, the idea that ‘almost any substance’ can act as a poison fails todifferentiate between substances that are inherently toxic, and thereforeharmful to all living organisms, and those that are not inherently toxic, butmay nevertheless adversely affect some organisms. The importance of thisdistinction cannot be overstated. It can, however, be illustrated by referenceto a comparison between arsenic and citrus fruits.Arsenic, a naturally-occurring substance, is inherently toxic and will thereforeharm all living organisms, including cats, dogs, rabbits and humans. The degreeof harm arsenic will cause to each type of organism, whether cat, dog, rabbit orhuman, will differ according to the exposure level and to the existence ofinnate abilities within each species to expel this particular toxin and repairthe resulting damage. The degree of harm caused by arsenic will also depend onthe unique health status and the unique body burden of toxins of each individualcat, dog, rabbit and human.Citrus fruits are not inherently toxic; they are eminently suitable foods forhumans, but are poorly tolerated by, and even considered ‘toxic’ to cats, dogsand rabbits. However, cats are carnivores, dogs are omnivores and rabbits areherbivores; they therefore have different dietary requirements from humans, who,as discussed in the previous section, are frugivores. The reason they all havedifferent dietary requirements is due to anatomical and physiologicaldifferences, especially within the digestive system; it is these differencesthat determine which substances are recognised by the body as ‘food’ and whichare recognised as ‘non-food’. Nevertheless, the over-consumption of foods mayproduce unpleasant effects, but this discomfort should not be interpreted tosuggest that the food has become a poison. The main purpose of such discomfortis to prevent any further intake of food as this would impede the digestivesystem’s ability to process the food that has already been consumed.Another reason that substances that are not inherently toxic, but may causeadverse effects, involves a disturbance to homeostasis, which is described inchapter 26 of the book entitled Anatomy and Physiology,> “Homeostasis, or the maintenance of constant conditions in the body, is a> fundamental property of all living things.”Homeostasis requires that all of the substances necessary for the body tofunction properly are present in the ‘right’ amount; substances that are presentin the ‘wrong’ amount will disturb homeostasis and therefore disrupt the body’sability to function properly, as the book also states,> “In the human body, the substances that participate in chemical reactions must> remain within narrow ranges of concentration. Too much or too little of a> single substance can disrupt your bodily functions.”The disruption to bodily functions caused by the ‘wrong’ amount or concentrationof essential substances, can be demonstrated by reference to the adverse healtheffects caused by a combination of excess calcium and insufficient magnesium, asdiscussed in the previous section. It should be obvious that calcium andmagnesium do not become ‘poisons’ simply as the result of their presence in thebody in the ‘wrong’ amounts; this is clearly the case with respect toinsufficient magnesium; a substance cannot become a ‘poison’ by virtue of itspresence at an inadequate level.The plethora of substances that are inherently toxic include, not only the vastmajority of the chemicals and compounds synthesised in the laboratories of thechemical industry, but also a number of naturally-occurring substances that havebeen exposed or brought to the surface from deep underground by the activitiesof various industries, as discussed in chapter six. Their inherently toxicnature means that these substances are incompatible with the human body’sbiochemical processes that sustain life; which means that they should not beingested, inhaled, injected or otherwise absorbed into the body at any dose orexposure level.Although different substances may cause different degrees of harm, they allcause damage at the cellular level, because the mechanism by which most, if notall toxic substances cause harm, is through the generation of free radicals thatinduce oxidative stress and lead to damage to the body’s cells and consequentlyto tissues and organs. The growing body of evidence that recognises oxidativestress to be the underlying mechanism common to most chronic health problemsfurther demonstrates that the relationship between ‘toxic substances’ and‘disease’ is direct and causal.The mechanism by which toxic substances produce their adverse effects was firstrecognised more than three decades ago; as indicated by a 1986 article entitledFree radicals and environmental toxins, which states that,> “Some chemicals that contaminate our environment exert their toxic effects by> virtue of their ability to form free radicals.”Research studies in the 1990s discovered that the ability to form free radicalswas not merely restricted to ‘some’ chemicals, but was found to be the mechanismcommon to increasing numbers of them; as indicated by a 1993 article entitledFree radicals in toxicology, which states that,> “Free radicals are recognized more and more frequently as being involved in> the mechanism of toxicity of chemicals.”The human body is not defenceless against the plethora of toxic substances towhich it is regularly exposed; on the contrary, the body possesses a number oforgans and systems that facilitate the removal of toxins from the body,otherwise known as detoxification. The most important organ that plays a vitalrole in detoxification is the liver, the establishment definition of whichstates that,> “It has an important role in the detoxification of poisonous substances…”The definition also states that,> “The liver is the site of many important diseases…”The ‘diseases’ referred to include hepatitis, cirrhosis and dysentery, all ofwhich represent the efforts of the body to expel ‘poisonous substances’, asindicated by their common symptoms, especially vomiting and diarrhoea.Although toxic substances can damage the liver, the body also possesses theability to regenerate this important organ, as indicated by a 2007 articleentitled Liver Regeneration, which states that,> “Liver manages to restore any lost mass and adjust its size to that of the> organism, while at the same time providing full support for body homeostasis> during the entire regenerative process.”The ability to expel toxins and regenerate the liver are two of the reasons thatthe human body is able to withstand certain levels of exposures to toxicsubstances. The body’s self-protective and self-healing mechanisms can, however,be compromised, by a single dose of or exposure to an extremely toxic substance,such as cyanide for example, that is potentially life-threatening. Thesemechanisms can also be compromised by continual exposures to toxic substances,which, although not life-threatening in a single dose or exposure, willnevertheless continue to cause damage at the cellular level and reduce thebody’s ability to function properly. These persistent exposures will alsocompromise the liver’s ability to function properly and can even damage thisvital organ.Unfortunately, one class of ‘toxic substances’ that are known to cause damage tothe liver are the pharmaceutical products used as ‘medicines’ to treat diseases,including diseases that affect the liver. The ability of commonly-used drugs toharm the liver is discussed in a 1986 article entitled The Spectrum ofHepatotoxicity Due to Drugs, which states that,> “Drugs in common use can cause toxic effects on the liver which can mimic> almost every naturally occurring liver disease in man.”Disease does not occur naturally; as the ‘new’ explanation states, diseaserepresents disruptions to the body’s functions due to exposures to harmfulsubstances and influences. The claim that the toxic effects of drugs ‘mimic’disease is therefore disingenuous; their inherently toxic nature means thatdrugs are the cause of damage to the liver; in other words, they are the directcause of ‘liver disease’. This phenomenon is recognised by a 2010 articleentitled Drug-induced Liver Injury, which states that,> “Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is common and nearly all classes of> medications can cause liver disease.”Although paracetamol (acetaminophen) is the drug most commonly associated withliver damage, the article refers to some of the other classes of ‘medications’known to damage the liver,> “…a broad range of different pharmacological agents can induce liver damage,> including anasthetics, anticancer drugs, antibiotics, antituberculosis agents,> antiretrovirals, and cardiac medications.”This statement is an unambiguous admission that the substances used as‘medicines’ to treat disease in the name of ‘healthcare’ are inherently toxic,and that, instead of restoring health, these ‘medicines’ cause damage to theliver, and thereby impair the activity of the main organ that processes toxinsand expels them from the body.Although the medical establishment claims that medicines ‘work’ by actions thatare intended to stimulate, block, depress, stabilise or otherwise correct bodilydysfunctions, it is clear that it is these ‘medicines’ that are the cause ofdysfunctions, which the body’s self-healing mechanisms need to rectify.Unfortunately, however, the body’s ability to expel toxins, repair damage andrestore health is almost invariably, albeit mistakenly, attributed to the drugs,as Herbert Shelton explains,> “It is these processes of resistance and expulsion and the processes by which> damages are repaired that are mistaken for the actions of drugs.”The only actions that drugs are capable of performing, involve the mechanism bywhich virtually all toxic substances are known to cause harm to the body at thecellular level, namely the generation of free radicals that induce oxidativestress; as indicated by a 2012 article entitled Drug-Induced Oxidative Stressand Toxicity, which states that,> “Drug-induced oxidative stress is implicated as a mechanism of toxicity in> numerous tissues and organ systems…”One of the organs known to be adversely affected by drug-induced oxidativestress is the liver, as demonstrated by the acknowledged presence of oxidativestress in ‘liver diseases’, such as hepatitis, cirrhosis and dysentery.Furthermore, as indicated by the above cited 2010 article about DILI,antituberculosis agents are one of the classes of drugs recognised to induceliver damage; in other words, the drugs used to treat tuberculosis are known tobe hepatotoxic. A 2018 article entitled Oxidative Stress and First LineAntituberculosis Drug-Induced Hepatotoxicity refers to the hepatotoxicityresulting from antituberculosis drugs as a ‘serious adverse reaction’ and statesthat,> “The association of oxidative stress with isoniazid-induced hepatotoxicity> appears to be reasonably well understood.”The failure of a patient to respond to first line TB drugs such as isoniazid isoften interpreted to mean that the ‘bacteria’ have developed ‘resistance’; but,as previously discussed, this is an erroneous interpretation. The article statesunequivocally that isoniazid induces hepatotoxicity and that this toxicityinvolves the mechanism of oxidative stress. This means that a patient’scontinuing, and often worsening, ill-health after treatment with isoniazid isdue to hepatotoxicity and a reduction in the liver’s ability to adequatelyprocess and eliminate this toxin. The problem of liver damage due to all typesof pharmaceutical drugs is demonstrated by the 2010 article about DILI, whichadmits that,> “Indeed, drug-induced hepatotoxicity is the most frequent cause of acute liver> failure in US.”The reasons that drug-induced hepatotoxicity has become such a serious problemin the US are highlighted by an August 2017 article entitled Too May Meds?America’s Love Affair With Prescription Medication. This article refers to astudy, which had shown that more than half of all Americans take at least oneprescription medication, and states that Americans take far more ‘pills’ thanthe people of any other country. In addition, prescription drug use in Americahas risen dramatically in the past few years, as indicated by another August2017 article entitled Americans taking more prescription drugs than ever: asurvey, which states that, according to one ‘health research firm’,> “The number of prescriptions filled for American adults and children rose 85> percent between 1997 and 2016, from 2.4 billion to 4.5 billion per year…”If pharmaceutical drugs were safe and effective, as the medical establishmentclaims them to be, then Americans ought to be the healthiest people in theworld, but this is not the case; the discussion in chapter one referred toreports that show Americans to be some of the least healthy population of a‘developed’ country. Furthermore, the harm caused by pharmaceuticals is alsorecognised by ‘establishment’ organisations, as indicated by the previouslycited Too Many Meds article, which states that, according to estimates based ondata from the CDC and FDA,> “Almost 1.3 million people went to U.S. emergency rooms due to adverse drug> effects in 2014, and about 124,000 died from those events.”The scale of adverse drug effects is a matter of serious concern. It isparticularly significant with respect to the 2030 Agenda goal to ensure thateveryone, everywhere has access to universal health coverage, and receiveshealthcare that includes the provision of ‘essential’ medicines and vaccines.Unfortunately, the toxic nature of these products will inevitably exacerbatehealth problems, not solve them.Another group of ‘harmful substances’ to which people are commonly exposed arethose collectively referred to as pesticides, the intended purpose of which isto destroy a wide variety of living organisms considered to be pests. Pesticidesare therefore toxic by intent, but they are also toxic by definition; the originof the suffix ‘-cide’ is the Latin term that means to kill. The best-known typesof pesticide are insecticides, herbicides, rodenticides and fungicides, butthere are many others, which, according to the EPA web page entitled Types ofPesticide Ingredients, include antimicrobials, biocides, disinfectants andmicrobial pesticides, all of which are used to kill ‘pathogenic microorganisms’,especially bacteria and viruses. But viruses should not be referred to as‘organisms’ as they are not alive, which means they cannot be ‘killed’.The EPA web page entitled Basic Information about Pesticide Ingredients statesthat pesticides contain both active ingredients, which disable or destroy thetarget pest, and inert ingredients, which perform other functions, such asextending the product’s shelf-life, for example. Although the EPA evaluates theactive ingredients and the overall product, inert ingredients only require EPA‘approval’, because, as the page also states,> “Under federal law, the identity of inert ingredients is confidential business> information.”Of particular note is the statement on the EPA web page that,> “The name ‘inert’ does not mean non-toxic.”Furthermore, inert ingredients are not required by US law to be identified onproduct labels; a situation that impedes independent scientific analysis ofthese ingredients to determine their potential adverse health effects eitherindividually, or in combination with any other chemicals. Although these are USlaws, it must be emphasised that the largest chemical companies aremultinational corporations and that, as discussed in chapter nine, mostregulatory agencies are heavily influenced by corporate vested interests.A variety of different pesticides are used in industrial agricultural practices,which is one of the most compelling reasons for choosing organically grownfoods; however, pesticides are also used in the name of ‘healthcare’ to control,but mainly to kill, a number of different ‘vectors’ claimed to cause variousdiseases by transmitting the parasites they are said to carry. These vectors,many of which are insects, are described in the October 2017 WHO fact sheetentitled Vector-borne diseases, which states that,> “Vector-borne diseases are human illnesses caused by parasites, viruses and> bacteria that are transmitted by mosquitoes, sandflies, triatomine bugs,> blackflies, ticks, tsetse flies, mites, snails and lice.”The diseases referred to include malaria, schistosomiasis, human Africantrypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis and Chagas disease, all of which were discussedin chapter eight. Although the WHO’s response to these diseases involves theimplementation of treatment and vaccination programmes, it also involvesstrategies to control the vectors, such as insecticide-treated nets and indoorresidual spraying techniques. It is claimed that the problem of vector-bornediseases is worsening; as indicated by the 2017 WHO report entitled GlobalVector Control Response 2017-2030, which states that,> “In recent years, vector-borne diseases have moved into new territory: many> diseases once limited to tropical and subtropical zones are now increasingly> seen in temperate zones.”One of the stated goals of this report, which will be referred to as the VectorControl report, is to prevent epidemics of vector-borne diseases in allcountries by 2030; this clearly aligns with the 2030 Agenda, the problems withwhich have been discussed.The ‘public health measures’ claimed to prevent the spread of these vector-bornediseases include ‘aircraft disinsection’, which entails the use of insecticidesto kill any insects that may have inadvertently entered an aircraft and preventthem from being introduced into other countries. Aircraft disinsection was firstintroduced in the 1940s to prevent the spread of malaria, although it wasrestricted to countries most affected by this disease. The Vector Control reportclaims that ‘increased global travel’ is one of the factors that has enabledinsect vectors to move into new territories and cause increased outbreaks ofthese diseases. Interestingly, however, a web page entitled AircraftDisinsection on the EPA website states that,> “According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there is> no evidence to show that using insecticide to kill mosquitoes inside aircraft> cabins is effective in preventing introduction and spread of mosquito-borne> disease.”There is, however, a fundamental problem with the basic idea that aircraft carrythese insects into ‘new territories’ where they cause disease. The discussionabout malaria in chapter eight demonstrated that Anopheles mosquitoes, as wellas the Plasmodium parasites they are claimed to carry, are ubiquitous; theyinhabit every continent on the planet, with the sole exception of Antarctica.Nevertheless, the 2030 Agenda goal to end the epidemic of malaria, inconjunction with the increasing focus on many other neglected tropical diseases,has encouraged the expansion of ‘aircraft disinsection’ programmes. Theinsecticides recommended by the WHO for use in these programmes are cited in the2013 IPCS report entitled Aircraft Disinsection Insecticides, which states that,> “For aircraft disinsection, WHO currently recommends d-phenothrin (2%) for> space spraying and permethrin (2%) for residual disinsection.”Permethrin and phenothrin are synthetic pyrethroids that are claimed to be of‘low toxicity’ to humans, but this does not mean that they are safe; however,the WHO web page entitled Aircraft disinsection states that,> “…WHO has found no evidence that the specified insecticide sprays are harmful> to health when used as recommended.”This statement is disingenuous, especially in view of the 2013 IPCS report thatstates,> “To date, no widely-accepted, peer-reviewed human health risk assessment model> for aircraft disinsection insecticides has been available.”It is clear that the information promulgated by the WHO contains manycontradictions; the claims that there are no human health risks and that therisks have not been assessed, differ substantially from those of the HealthyEnvironments report, which acknowledges the toxicity of the insecticides used to‘manage’ vectors and states that,> “The use of chemicals raises issues of human and animal toxicity,> environmental pollution and sustainability as resistance remains a constant> threat.”The contradictory nature of the information promulgated by the WHO is furtherdemonstrated by a comparison between the denial that insecticides are harmful tohuman health and the findings of a WHO-led consultation in July 2018, which werepublished in a report entitled Methods and operating procedures for aircraftdisinsection. The report refers to concerns raised by some of the participantsabout the active ingredients in the insecticides used, and states that,> “…some can be detrimental to human health when applied in cabins.”Despite the obfuscation by the WHO about the adverse health effects of theingredients of ‘aircraft disinsection’ insecticides, there is a growing body ofevidence that demonstrates their active ingredients, especially permethrin, tobe harmful to human health; as indicated by a 2016 article entitledPermethrin-induced oxidative stress and toxicity and metabolism. A review, whichstates that it was originally believed that permethrin (PER) had ‘low mammaliantoxicity’, but adds the comment that,> “However, as its use became more extensive worldwide, increasing evidence> suggested that PER might have a variety of toxic effects on animals and humans> alike…”It would seem that the WHO website requires an urgent update to include thisscientific evidence.In common with all other toxic substances, the mechanism of action ofpermethrin’s toxicity involves oxidative stress, as the article also states,> “A growing number of studies indicate that oxidative stress played critical> roles in the various toxicities associated with PER.”The article further states that the toxic effects of permethrin includeneurotoxicity and reproductive effects. Permethrin-based insecticides are usedfor aircraft disinsection on flights involving countries said to be ‘at risk’from the Zika virus, which is claimed to be transmitted by mosquitoes. It shouldbe noted that the health problems claimed to be caused by this virus include‘neurological disorders’ and ‘neonatal malformations’; in other words, the Zikavirus is claimed to cause exactly the same health problems that have beendemonstrated to be caused by permethrin.Previous discussions, especially those in chapter eight, demonstrate thatso-called ‘vector-borne’ diseases are not caused by parasites transmitted bymosquitoes, or any other vector; instead, as the ‘new’ explanation states,disease is the result of exposures to ‘harmful substances’.Pharmaceuticals and pesticides are clearly not the only ‘harmful substances’ towhich people are exposed, but the purpose of the foregoing discussions is tohighlight the inappropriate use of products that contain toxic ingredients inthe name of healthcare.Despite the incessant media reports which erroneously claim that climate changedue to high atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide poses the most serious threatto humanity, there is a small, but growing level of public awareness that thevery real and far more serious threat to humanity is posed by environmentalpollution caused by the toxic substances produced, used and discharged by manydifferent industries. There is also a growing level of awareness amongst theresearch community that environmental pollutants are a significant contributoryfactor to human health problems; as indicated by a 2017 article entitled Impactof nutrition on pollutant toxicity: an update with new insights into epigeneticregulation, which states that,> “Exposure to environmental pollutants is a global health problem and is> associated with the development of many chronic diseases…”The only environmental pollutants specifically referred to in the article arePOPs, heavy metals and air pollution, but there are many others. The articledoes however, refer to oxidative stress as the mechanism by which thesepollutants exert their harmful effects.The hazardous nature of the chemical ingredients of a wide variety of productscommonly used in the home and workplace was discussed in chapter six, which alsorevealed that, although some have been tested individually and deemed ‘safe’,the vast majority of chemicals remain untested. More importantly, none of thecombinations of chemicals to which people are regularly exposed has ever beentested for their safety or to determine their potential adverse health effects.It may seem that the health hazards due to environmental pollution are of such amagnitude that it must be virtually impossible for anyone to be able to becomeand remain healthy; but this is not necessarily the case. As previouslydiscussed, the body possesses innate mechanisms to expel toxins, repair damageand restore health. Although these mechanisms and the processes they regulatewill be damaged and their effectiveness weakened by continual exposure to toxicsubstances, this damage can be mitigated, but it requires ongoing efforts tominimise exposures to toxic substances. It also requires ongoing efforts tomaximise the intake of nutrients, especially antioxidants to counteract freeradicals and prevent them from causing damage within the body.Informed decisions can only be made when people are in possession of all thenecessary information; therefore, in order to minimise and even avoid exposuresto toxic substances, it is essential to know about all types of applicationsthat utilise products that contain ingredients made from harmful substances.Whilst it may not be possible to completely avoid all toxins, it is certainlypossible to avoid a significant proportion of them, especially those that areingredients of products to which the body is directly exposed; these includeproducts that are ingested and inhaled as well as those applied directly ontothe body.One group of products that are introduced directly into the body are thoseconsumed as foods and drinks, although medicines and vaccines also fall intothis category. The discussion about nutrition and water in the previous sectiondemonstrates that a diet comprised of fresh, whole, organically-grown,plant-based foods is one that will maximise the intake of nutrients. This typeof diet will also help to minimise the intake of toxins, as it will preclude theintake of the toxic chemicals commonly used by industrial agriculturalpractices. Furthermore, in addition to boosting the intake of nutrients, a dietof this nature will also assist with detoxification; as explained by Dr Blaylockin Health and Nutrition Secrets,> “…numerous pesticides, herbicides, foreign organic chemicals, fluoride,> mercury, aluminium, and other toxic substances are assaulting our bodies. All> of these compounds must be detoxified, putting a heavy demand on our> detoxification systems – all of which are dependent on nutrition.”It must be noted that, in the same way that toxins accumulate in the body overthe course of time, their elimination from the body will also require time;detoxification is therefore an ongoing process. In addition, it must beemphasised that the processes that expel toxins from the body often involve‘symptoms’ that are commonly associated with ‘disease’; but, in accordance withthe ‘new’ explanation, these symptoms must now be recognised as normal bodilyprocesses, which means that they should not be ‘treated’ with pharmaceuticals.Although certain programmes are promoted as methods to acceleratedetoxification, they are not recommended, except in cases of acute poisoningwith a highly toxic substance. One of the reasons to avoid such programmes isbecause the body’s detoxification organs are likely to have been compromised,which means that the elimination processes may not function as efficiently asthey should. It is preferable, and safer, to allow the body to perform itsdetoxification processes naturally and to support these innate self-healingmechanisms by minimising the intake of toxins and maximising the intake ofnutrients.The main group of products that are regularly applied directly onto the body arecosmetics and personal care products, many of which, as previously discussed,contain toxic ingredients. But they are a source of toxic exposures that can beminimised and even avoided; as Dr Epstein explains in Toxic Beauty,> “Cosmetics and personal-care products today constitute our single largest but> generally unrecognised class of avoidable exposure to toxic ingredients and> their health dangers.”The health dangers of the toxic ingredients used in many cosmetics and personalcare products are no longer ‘generally unrecognised’; instead, the problem hasreceived sufficient attention that it has raised public awareness of and concernabout these toxic chemicals. The adverse publicity this has generated has alsobeen of such concern to the manufacturers of these products, that some havechanged their formulations and replaced toxic ingredients, such as phthalates,parabens, SLS and SLES, with ‘new’ chemicals. But this has not always resultedin ‘safer’ products; some of the replacement chemicals have been found to beequally if not more toxic.Fortunately, there are many new companies that are producing their own ranges ofcosmetics and personal care products without toxic ingredients; informationabout these companies and their products can be found throughout the internet.The website of the Environmental Working Group (EWG), a US-based organisation,is one example of a useful resource with information about the toxic chemicalingredients of cosmetics and personal care products and about saferalternatives.The Good Trade website is another example of a useful resource; as indicated bythe information provided in the article entitled 10 Natural & Organic MakeupBrands Your Face Will Love You For. People must, however, investigate forthemselves the ingredients of the products they intend to purchase, especiallyas terms such as ‘natural’ may be used as marketing ploys, as indicated by thearticle that states,> “Many makeup brands marketed as ‘natural’ or ‘green’ are often not actually> either of these things…”One of the most powerful actions that people can take is to ‘vote with yourwallet’; to reject toxic products and support the manufacturers of safer,non-toxic products.It is important to emphasise that the references in this section to websitesthat feature safer alternatives should not be construed as recommendations or asendorsements of any of the listed products, as this is not the case. Thesewebsites are included solely for the purpose of illustrating the kind ofinformation that is available for people who wish to reduce their toxicexposures, and to enable them to make informed decisions about the products theywish to purchase.One of the myths listed on the EWG web page entitled Myths on cosmetics safetyis the idea that chemicals are generally absorbed in only negligible amountsinto the body. The EWG response to this myth includes reference to studies inwhich many toxic chemicals, such as phthalates, parabens and triclosan, havebeen found in significant amounts within the bodies of men, women and children.Furthermore, the discussion about ‘poisoned bodies’ in chapter six refers to the2014 IPCS Dermal Exposure report, which admits that substances can cross theskin barrier and cause ‘systemic effects', and exposes yet another medicalestablishment ‘knowledge gap’ in the statement that,> “For most chemicals, however, the relationship between dermal uptake and> health effects observed elsewhere in the body is still poorly understood.”It should be noted that, not only have many chemicals been recognised topenetrate the skin and enter the bloodstream, but that phthalates, parabens andtriclosan are all associated with oxidative stress. This clearly provides a fullexplanation for the relationship between toxic chemicals applied to the skin andadverse health effects, despite the lack of understanding exhibited in the IPCSreport.Another large group of products that constitute a major source of toxicexposures are those utilised for tasks such as cleaning and general maintenance,whether in the home or workplace. Although these products contain a variety ofdifferent chemical ingredients, a significant proportion of them containvolatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are substances that are released asgases that can be inhaled; it is for this reason that some of the most commonhealth effects of VOCs involve the respiratory system, although other importantorgans and systems can also be adversely affected.The EPA web page entitled Volatile Organic Compounds’ Impact on Indoor AirQuality states that the adverse health effects of VOCs include damage to theliver, kidneys and central nervous system, which is a clear demonstration oftheir hazardous nature. Two well-known VOCs are benzene and formaldehyde, bothof which are highly toxic chemicals that are known to exert their toxic effectsthrough oxidative stress and the resulting cellular damage by free radicals. Thetypes of products that may contain VOCs are listed on the EPA web page andinclude: paints, paint strippers and other solvents; cleansers anddisinfectants; building materials and furnishings; and graphics and craftmaterials. Perchloroethylene, which is commonly used in dry-cleaning operations,is also a VOC.Exposures to VOCs and many other toxic chemicals can, however, be minimised andeven prevented as many safer products with less toxic or even non-toxicingredients are available. The EWG web page entitled Guide to Healthy Cleaningfor example, provides information about safer cleaning products available in theUS. The Good Trade website also provides information about safer cleaningproducts, such as the article entitled 11 Natural & Eco-Friendly CleaningProducts For The Conscious Home, for example. Many cleaning tasks can beperformed using entirely natural materials; as indicated by the OrganicConsumers Association article entitled How Toxic Are Your Household CleaningSupplies? which states that,> “A few safe, simple ingredients like soap, water, baking soda, vinegar, lemon> juice and borax, aided by a little elbow grease and a coarse brush for> scrubbing, can take care of most household cleaning needs.”Clothes are another group of products that are often manufactured using toxicmaterials and processes, as discussed in chapter six. Although some well-knownclothing manufacturers have agreed to reduce the amount of toxic chemicals theyuse, there are many new companies that manufacture clothes using non-toxicmaterials, such as organic cotton, and safer processes using azo-free dyes, forexample. The Good Trade web page entitled 35 Fair Trade and Ethical ClothingBrands Betting Against Fast Fashion lists a number of these new clothingcompanies, most, but not all, of which are based in the US. A number of clothingcompanies based in Europe are listed on the Ecocult web page entitled The BestSustainable and Ethical European Fashion Brands. There are also saferalternatives for soft furnishings and bedding; as indicated by The Good Tradeweb page entitled 10 Organic Sheets and Bedding Sources To Help You SleepSweetly.Plastics are another group of toxic materials that are widely used to make ahuge variety of products, containers and wrapping materials; the hazardousnature of plastics and their lack of biodegradability were discussed in chaptersix. There is, however, a growing level of public awareness of the problem ofenvironmental pollution due to plastics. There is also an increasing variety ofproducts that are made without plastics; the Life Without Plastics website, forexample, features a number of plastic-free products. The Recycling website alsofeatures a variety of plastic-free products available in the US on a pageentitled Kickstart Your Zero Waste Lifestyle. Plastic-free products available inthe UK are featured on the website of The Plastic Free Shop.It is abundantly clear from the discussion in this section that toxic chemicalsare entirely unnecessary for the manufacture of a huge variety of products andthat there are safer, less toxic alternatives for many of the products peopleuse on a regular, if not daily basis. It is equally clear that choosing saferalternatives will contribute to a significant reduction in each person’s levelof toxic exposures.EM Radiation ExposuresElectromagnetic radiation is a form of energy that extends over a range offrequencies and wavelengths collectively known as the electromagnetic spectrum.Although different sections of the spectrum have been given different labels,such as visible light and microwaves, for example, all forms of electromagneticradiation are categorised as either ionising or non-ionising according to theintensity of the energy they possess.As previously discussed, the Earth has always existed in the presence of a lowlevel of ionising radiation, known as ‘natural background radiation’, thatoccurs as the result of a combination of the radioactivity emitted bynaturally-occurring radioactive materials, within or beneath the Earth’s crust,and the presence in the atmosphere of cosmic radiation emitted by the sun andstars. Although the background level had been gradually augmented due toradioactive materials released by activities such as mining, it was profoundlyaltered in the mid-20th century as the result of the development, testing anduse of nuclear weapons. Environmental levels of ionising radiation havecontinued to rise mainly as the result of the ongoing operations of the nuclearindustry, especially nuclear power plants. There are other applications ofionising radiation that have contributed to the increased level of exposure; asindicated by the April 2016 WHO fact sheet entitled Ionizing radiation, healtheffects and protective measures that states,> “Ionizing radiation has many beneficial applications, including uses in> medicine, industry, agriculture and research.”The natural electromagnetic environment has also been altered by ‘unnatural’non-ionising radiation, the level of which began to increase after theintroduction of AC (alternating current) electricity as the main power sourcefor virtually all machines and equipment, both domestic and industrial. Aspreviously discussed, all electrical equipment and appliances that utiliseelectricity produce electromagnetic fields (EMFs). Environmental concentrationsof EM radiation have further increased, and more rapidly, since the latter partof the 20th century as the result of the new technologies developed by thetelecommunications industry, such as mobile phones and wireless communications,that utilise electromagnetic frequencies in the RF and ELF ranges.It is clear that the Earth’s electromagnetic environment has been irrevocablyaltered at an incredibly rapid pace and over the course of an incredibly shortperiod of time. Dr Robert Becker MD describes the situation in his 1990 bookCross Currents,> “Today, we swim in a sea of energy that is almost totally man-made.”The problem with this man-made sea of energy is that it interferes with thefunctioning of the natural electrical systems of living organisms, especiallyhumans. In their book entitled Earthing: The Most Important Health DiscoveryEver! co-authors Clinton Ober, Martin Zucker and Stephen Sinatra MD explainthat,> “We all live and function electrically on an electrical planet.”Interestingly, there is a growing body of compelling evidence that indicates theentire universe is fundamentally electrical in nature.Human health can be adversely affected by exposures to ‘harmful influences’,such as ‘man-made’ electromagnetic radiation, as well as ‘harmful substances’,such as ‘man-made’ chemicals. Although the chemical industry justifies theproduction and use of synthetic chemicals on the basis of the claim that‘everything is made of chemicals’, this claim is misleading because ‘matter’ isalso electrical in nature.All matter is composed of atoms and each atom is composed of a combination ofthree main subatomic particles, namely, protons, neutrons and electrons. Thenature of each chemical element is determined by its atomic structure; ahydrogen atom, for example, contains one proton and one electron, whereas acarbon atom contains six protons and six electrons. The electrical aspects ofmatter are, however, primary because all subatomic particles have electricalproperties; protons have a positive electrical charge and electrons a negativecharge. Neutrons are said to have equal negative and positive charges whichbalance each other to produce an overall neutral charge. In most atoms, thenumber of protons equals the number of electrons, which means there will be nooverall electrical charge; but if proton and electron numbers are not equal, theatom will have a charge. An electrically charged atom or molecule is known as anion.Ions are produced by different processes, one of which, known as ‘dissociation’,refers to the separation of chemical compounds into smaller particles, includingions, when dissolved in a liquid. Sodium chloride, for example, will dissolve inwater and separate into positive sodium ions and negative chloride ions. Withinthe body, however, ions, or electrolytes as they are also called, performimportant functions that include transmitting an electrical current across thecell membrane. A number of important minerals, especially sodium, potassium,calcium and magnesium, are also electrolytes, which means that they are ofextreme importance to the maintenance of electrical homeostasis as well aschemical homeostasis.It is clear that, although electrical properties are primary, the electrical andchemical aspects of matter are intimately interconnected; it is therefore moreaccurate to state that ‘everything’, including the human body, iselectro-chemical in nature.Ions are also produced by ionising radiation, which involves a very differentprocess from dissociation; as previously discussed, ionising radiation possessessufficient energy to break molecular bonds and release free electrons. However,although ‘free electrons’ are also known as ‘free radicals’, those produced byionising radiation are far more dangerous to living cells. In his 1997 articleentitled The Free-Radical Fallacy about Ionizing Radiation, Dr John Gofman MDexplains that,> “Ionizing radiation instantly unloads biologically abnormal amounts of energy> at random in an irradiated cell.”It is the release of ‘abnormal amounts’ of energy in a very short period of timethat results in adverse effects that occur almost immediately; as indicated bythe previously cited WHO Ionizing radiation fact sheet, which states that,> “Acute health effects such as skin burns or acute radiation syndrome can occur> when doses of radiation exceed certain levels.”The CDC web page entitled Acute Radiation Syndrome: A Fact Sheet for Cliniciansdefines ‘acute radiation syndrome’ as an acute ‘illness’ and states that thiscondition, which is also known as radiation toxicity and radiation sickness,occurs as the result of exposure to a high dose of penetrating radiation. Thepage cites the survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombs as peoplewho would have suffered from this ‘illness’; it is however, wholly inappropriateto describe the horrifying effects of ionising radiation from nuclear bombs aseither an illness or a syndrome.Unfortunately, the medical establishment operates from the basis of the ideathat ‘disease-causing entities’ must be destroyed. Their arsenal of weapons todefeat these entities includes certain forms of ionising radiation that are usedto treat certain diseases, especially cancers. Although the use of ionisingradiation is believed to be ‘beneficial’, because it is said to destroy thecancer without killing the patient, the fact sheet nevertheless acknowledgesthat,> “Low doses of ionizing radiation can increase the risk of longer term effects> such as cancer.”In other words, the treatment is recognised to cause the very ‘disease’ forwhich it is used as a remedy; however, no ‘dose’ of radiation has the ability torestore a person to health. The discussion in chapter six cites Dr Karl Z MorganPhD, who stated in 1978 that,> “There is no safe level of exposure and there is no dose of radiation so low> that the risk of a malignancy is zero.”Nevertheless, low doses or exposures do not inevitably lead to cancer. Thelikelihood that a person will develop cancer, or any other ‘chronic disease’, isnot a matter of ‘risk’ or ‘chance’ or even ‘genes’. It is entirely dependent oneach individual’s unique health status, which will be influenced by the degreeto which they are affected by all of the ‘four factors’ discussed in thischapter.In common with all other ‘harmful substances and influences’, electromagneticradiation exerts its adverse effects through the mechanism of oxidative stressthat induces free radical damage at the cellular level; EM radiation is,however, particularly detrimental to the organs and systems that operateelectrically. One of the main organs that function electrically is the heart; itis therefore unsurprising that, as discussed in chapter seven, a relationshipexists between exposures to EMFs, oxidative stress and cardiac problems. It isimportant to emphasise that the body’s electrical system only requires very tinyamounts of electrical energy; as indicated by the previously cited statement byDr Becker in Cross Currents,> “The body’s internal energetic control systems are subtle, and they operate> with minute amounts of electromagnetic energy.”The body’s delicate electrical system can be, and invariably is, disrupted byunnatural electromagnetic fields.The degree of harm that may result from exposures to low levels of non-ionisingEM radiation will depend on each person’s health status, which includes theirunique body burden of toxins. Interestingly, there is evidence that asynergistic relationship exists between toxic chemicals and non-ionising EMradiation; as indicated by the EHT article entitled WirelessRadiation/Electromagnetic Fields Increases Toxic Body Burden, which refers tothe known adverse health effects of toxic chemicals and states that,> “In addition, wireless and EMF radiation can synergistically increase the> effect of these daily toxic exposures…”The mechanism by which toxins and EM radiation interact synergistically is notknown, but may relate to the fact that they both exert their effects through thegeneration of free radicals. Of particular concern, however, is that EMradiation has been shown to affect the blood-brain barrier, as the article alsostates,> “…replicated research shows that wireless radiation increases the permeability> of the blood-brain barrier, allowing more movement of toxic chemicals into> vulnerable organs.”The brain is extremely important; it is the other main organ that functionselectrically. Many of the implications, and indeed some of the consequences, forthe brain from the synergistic interactions between EM radiation and toxicchemicals were referred to in the discussion about autism. The most significantconsequences will be for children, whose brains are particularly vulnerable asthey are still undergoing development; however, neurological problems are notexclusive to children; they can also affect adults.It is important to emphasise that the body is not defenceless against ‘harmfulsubstances and influences’; it possesses many mechanisms that respond to theirpresence. One of these mechanisms, known as the ‘cellular stress response’, isdiscussed by Professor Martin Blank PhD, with particular reference to thecellular response to EM radiation, in his article entitled The Cellular StressResponse: EMF-DNA Interaction published in the BioInitiative Report 2012. Inthis article, which will be referred to as the Stress Response article, hestates that,> “The cellular stress response is a protective reaction of individual cells to> potentially harmful stimuli in the environment. It is characterized by the> synthesis of a class of proteins referred to as stress proteins.”The cellular stress response is not the same as the body’s production ofhormones in response to ‘stress’, which is discussed in the next section.The first stimulus discovered to induce the cellular stress response is heating,which is the reason that these proteins were initially called heat shockproteins. These proteins are described in a 2004 article entitled ‘The stress ofdying’: the role of heat shock proteins in the regulation of apoptosis, whichstates that,> “Heat shock proteins (Hsps) are a family of highly homologous chaperone> proteins that are induced in response to environmental, physical and chemical> stresses and that limit the consequences of damage and facilitate cellular> recovery.”The acknowledgement that a variety of different ‘stresses’ induce the samecellular response further validates the ‘new’ explanation that asserts diseasesare not separate ‘entities’, but merely different manifestations of cellulardamage and the resulting bodily dysfunctions.As the above article indicates, the cellular stress response can be induced bystimuli other than heating; however, non-thermal stimuli can induce thisresponse at exposure levels that are orders of magnitude lower than those atwhich the tissues would be heated; as Professor Blank also states in his StressResponse article,> “In fact, the cells were far more sensitive to EMF than to thermal stimuli,> the threshold energy of the EMF stimulus being more than one billion times> weaker than an effective thermal stimulus.”Despite this evidence, the WHO continues to assert that tissue heating is themain adverse health effect of non-ionising radiation; as indicated by theOctober 2014 fact sheet entitled Electromagnetic fields and public health:mobile phones, which, as previously cited, states that,> “Tissue heating is the principal mechanism of interaction between> radiofrequency energy and the human body.”The ICNIRP guidelines that claim to protect people from the effects ofnon-ionising radiation have set thresholds at levels that would prevent tissueheating on the basis that this is the only relevant adverse effect. The WHO webpages relating to the topic of Electromagnetic fields include an undated pageentitled Research, which refers to research into the health effects of exposuresto EM radiation and states that,> “All reviews conducted so far have indicated that exposures below the limits> recommended in the ICNIRP (1998) guidelines, covering the full frequency range> from 0-300 GHz, do not produce any known adverse health effects.”Although the page recognises the existence of some ‘knowledge gaps’ that need tobe filled, the claim that there are no known adverse health effects isdisingenuous. RF and ELF are both classified by the IARC as Group 2Bcarcinogens, which means they are both officially recognised as ‘possible’ humancarcinogens. This classification challenges the claim that tissue heating is theonly relevant adverse health effect.The ICNIRP guidelines, now more than two decades old, are wholly inadequate togenuinely protect people, as they fail to reflect ongoing scientific researchfindings that continue to conclusively demonstrate the existence of seriousnon-thermal effects at exposure levels below those deemed to be safe by thegoverning bodies. Unfortunately, the WHO, ICNIRP and all other ‘establishment’organisations that make pronouncements about the health effects of exposures toEM radiation, fail to acknowledge these non-thermal effects, mainly as theresult of the influence of ‘vested interests’, especially those of thetelecommunications and related industries.A December 2018 article entitled Planetary electromagnetic pollution: it is timeto assess its impact refers to the proliferation of artificial electromagneticfields and states that,> “The most notable is the blanket of radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation,> largely microwave radiation generated for wireless communication and> surveillance technologies, as mounting scientific evidence suggests that> prolonged exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation has serious> biological and health effects.”The classification of RF and ELF as merely ‘possible’ carcinogens is no longertenable; there is a large body of evidence, which demonstrates that arelationship exists between EM radiation and oxidative stress, cellular damageand cancer, and that this relationship is both direct and causal. A May 2018article entitled Radiofrequency radiation from nearby base stations gives highlevels in an apartment in Stockholm, Sweden: A case report states that,> “RF radiation leads to oxidative stress in biological systems, including the> brain, due to an increase in free radicals and changes in antioxidant defence> systems.”The article refers to studies that have shown radiofrequency radiation toincrease the risk of cancer and have resulted in recommendations that RFradiation be upgraded from Group 2B to Group 1, the category for known humancarcinogens.The thresholds set by the ICNIRP guidelines are clearly in urgent need ofrevision, as Professor Blank emphasises in his Stress Response article,> “It should be obvious that EMF safety standards are based on false assumptions> and must be revised to reflect the scientific evidence.”Unfortunately, the continually growing body of evidence that demonstratesexposures to non-ionising EM radiation to be associated with serious adversehealth effects, is largely ignored by the telecommunications and relatedindustries that are preparing for the imminent introduction of 5G, the fifthgeneration of wireless infrastructure, which is intended to facilitate theimplementation of the Internet of Things (IoT). It must be emphasised that 5Gwill augment, not replace, existing 2G, 3G and 4G technologies.There are many concerns about 5G and its related infrastructure andtechnologies, one of which is that it will raise the existing concentration ofelectromagnetic radiation in the environment to unacceptable levels. Thefrequencies to be used for 5G are at the high end of the radiofrequency sectionof the spectrum; these high frequency radio waves are also known as millimetrewaves (MMW), due to their wavelength. But 5G will not be the first applicationof this range of frequencies, as MMWs are currently employed in airport bodyscanners used in a number of countries, most notably the US. These scanners areclaimed to be ‘safe’ because they are low in energy; as indicated by the CDC webpage entitled Radiation from Airport Security Scanning, which states that,> “This form of technology uses low-energy non-ionizing radiation that releases> thousands of times less energy than a cell phone.”This does not mean that they do not produce any adverse health effects. Asdiscussed in chapter six, the military utilise MMWs in Active Denial Systems forapplications such as crowd control, because they are known to produce extremelyunpleasant sensations within the skin; sensations that are intended todiscourage people from remaining within the vicinity of the source and toencourage them to disperse.It is claimed that MMWs only heat the skin, but as has been repeatedly shown,adverse health effects from exposures to non-ionising radiation occur at levelsorders of magnitude lower than those at which heating occurs. In his February2019 article entitled 5G Wireless Technology: Millimeter Wave Health Effects, DrJoel Moskowitz PhD explains that MMWs are,> “…mostly absorbed within 1-2 millimeters of human skin…”This seemingly superficial level of absorption into the skin does not mean thatthe rest of the body will remain unaffected; as he further explains,> “Since skin contains capillaries and nerve endings, MMW bio-effects may be> transmitted through molecular mechanisms by the skin or through the nervous> system.”The implementation of 5G, and its related infrastructure and technologies tofacilitate the interconnection of all devices that utilise SMART(Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technologies) systems through the IoT,will clearly intensify the existing concentration of ‘unnatural’ EM radiation.In common with all previous generations of wireless technologies, however, 5G isto be implemented without a full investigation of the potential consequences forhuman health, as Dr Moskowitz states,> “Unfortunately, few studies have examined prolonged exposure to low-intensity> MMWs, and no research that I am aware of has focused on exposure to MMWs> combined with other radiofrequency radiation.”Fortunately, 180 scientists concerned about the implementation of 5G in theabsence of safety studies have signed a declaration addressed to the EuropeanCommission. The previously cited EHT web page entitled Scientists And DoctorsDemand Moratorium On 5G Warning of Health Effects explains that this declarationrequests the Commission to recommend a moratorium on the implementation of 5G,> “…until potential hazards for human health and the environment have been fully> investigated by scientists independent from industry.”However, sufficient evidence has already accumulated to demonstrate thatexposures to electromagnetic radiation in the radiofrequency range is extremelydetrimental, not only to humans but to all living organisms, mainly as theresult of oxidative stress, the underlying mechanism common to virtually allconditions of ill-health.Although exposures to certain forms of EM radiation may be unavoidable, othersources of exposure can be avoided or minimised. According to the WHO, mostexposures to ionising radiation are the result of medical examinations anddiagnostic procedures; X-rays and CT scans for example; these exposures areavoidable. Other sources of exposure to ionising radiation, such as nuclearpower plants and uranium mines for example, may not be so easy to avoid,particularly for people who work in these industries or live in their vicinity.The phenomenal expansion in technologies that employ EM radiation in theradiofrequency range have profoundly changed the nature of the electromagneticenvironment throughout the world. Although the wireless communications systemson which mobile phones and other devices depend are ubiquitous, they are higherwithin urban areas. Each person’s exposure to non-ionising radiation willtherefore depend, to a large extent, on where they live and work and on thenature of the devices, equipment and wireless systems they use, as well as thoseto which they are involuntarily exposed.It is important to emphasise that the body’s electrical system operates usingcurrents that flow in only one direction, which is referred to as direct current(DC). Mains electricity, by contrast, operates with alternating current (AC)electricity, which means that electric current flows change direction. Allelectrical equipment and appliances produce electromagnetic fields in the ELF(extremely low frequency) range that interfere with the body’s delicateelectrical system and are associated with a number of adverse health effects,including leukaemia and brain tumours. As previously mentioned, the IARC hasclassified ELF EM radiation as a Group 2B ‘possible’ human carcinogen.One particularly useful source of information about a wide variety of topicspertaining to EM radiation exposures is the Powerwatch website. In the sectionof the website labelled Article library are many different publicationsavailable for download. The Child Cancer section, for example, includes apublication entitled Ionising radiation that discusses diagnostic X-rays and CTscans and explains that CT scans give a higher dose of ionising radiation thanX-rays.In the section entitled Powerfrequency EMFs and Health is a publication entitledCellular changes and potential mechanisms that refers to ‘free radical effects’that can affect the ‘brain oxidative balance’ which could lead to the reductionof melatonin, a powerful antioxidant. The consequences of reduced melatoninlevels are discussed by Dr Neil Cherry in his 2002 article entitled EMF/EMRReduces Melatonin in Animals and People, which, although previously cited inchapter six, deserves repetition,> “...reduced melatonin output causes many serious biological effects in humans> and other mammals, including sleep disturbance, chronic fatigue, DNA damage> leading to cancer, cardiac, reproductive and neurological diseases and> mortality.”The Powerwatch website also contains a number of other publications relating toexposures to EM radiation in the home from various appliances and equipment, aswell as outside the home, from sources such as phone masts. In addition toinformation about the sources of exposure and the scientific studies that haveinvestigated the effects, the website also offers advice about reducingexposures.The most widely used device is the mobile phone, it is also the most widelystudied; the adverse effects on the brain, especially tumours, are welldocumented. The EHT website is another source of useful information anddownloadable documents, not only about the hazards but also advice aboutreducing exposures, such as the page entitled 10 Tips To Reduce Cell PhoneRadiation. The document entitled What You Need To Know About 5G Wireless and‘Small Cells’ explains that safer alternatives exist and states that,> “Worldwide, many regions are investing in wired, fiberoptic connections which> are safer, faster, more reliable, provide greater capacity and are more> cyber-secure.”The body is an electrical system that needs to be maintained in the state ofhomeostasis, which can be assisted by making direct contact with the Earth; thisis discussed in the Earthing book referred to at the beginning of this section.However, although the authors of Earthing do not claim that making directcontact with the Earth reduces the effects of EM radiation, they do claim that‘grounding’ helps to restore electrical homeostasis and that,> “…Earthing naturally protects the body’s delicate bioelectrical circuitry> against static electrical charges and interference.”EM radiation mainly exerts its effects via oxidative stress that increases thegeneration of free radicals and reduces the effectiveness of the body’s naturalantioxidant system. These effects can, however, be mitigated by efforts tosupport the body, especially the regular consumption of antioxidant-rich foods.It is, of course, extremely important to pay attention not only to nutrition,but to all of the ‘four factors’ discussed in this book, including ‘stress’, thefourth factor and the topic of the next section.StressThe general understanding of stress is described by the Oxford Dictionary thatrefers to,> “mental or emotional strain or tension.”In this context, stress is an effect. The establishment definition provided bythe Oxford Concise Medical Dictionary, by contrast, describes stress as a cause;as indicated by the reference to stress as,> “any factor that threatens the health of the body or has an adverse effect on> its functioning, such as injury, disease, or worry.”In addition to their descriptions of seemingly different phenomena, thesedefinitions only refer to the ‘negative’ connotations of stress. But this ismisleading; stress also has ‘positive’ connotations, as indicated by a 2005article entitled Stressed or stressed out: What is the difference? which statesthat,> “For some, it means excitement and challenge (‘good stress’); for many others,> it reflects an undesirable state of chronic fatigue, worry, frustration and> inability to cope (‘bad stress’).”Dr Hans Selye MD, who is widely regarded as one of the key pioneers in thisfield of research, refers to stress as an effect; as indicated by his definitionof the term in his book entitled The Stress of Life as,> “…the nonspecific response of the body to any demand, whether it is caused by,> or results in, pleasant or unpleasant conditions.”In order to distinguish between causes and effects, Dr Selye created the term‘stressor’ to refer to causal factors and retained the term ‘stress’ to refer tothe effects, as indicated by his definition. In order to differentiate betweenits positive and negative connotations, he created the term ‘eustress’ to referto ‘good stress’ and employed the term ‘distress’ to refer to ‘bad stress’.These are the terms and the context in which they will be used in the ensuingdiscussion.Distress is associated with emotions, such as fear, worry and the inability tocope, that arise as the result of tragic life events, such as the death of aloved one, or situations that pose a direct threat to life, such as a war, forexample. Eustress is associated with emotions such as joy, excitement andexhilaration that can result from pleasantly challenging life events, such as anew career opportunity, although for some people events of this nature maygenerate ‘distress’.Dr Selye explains that any ordinary, everyday activity or emotion that places ademand on the body can be regarded as a stressor; the resulting ‘stress’ in thiscontext, is therefore perfectly normal and unlikely to be detrimental to health.Eustress and distress are not the same as this normal stress; they represent aheightened level of stress caused by stressors that are not part of ordinary,everyday life. However, although eustress and distress represent increaseddemands on the body, they are not associated with the same effects; eustress isoften regarded as beneficial, whereas distress is widely regarded as damaging tohealth, especially when prolonged.The body’s response to stressors is said to involve the ‘fight or flight’response, also known as the ‘acute stress response’, which triggers theendocrine system to secrete high concentrations of certain hormones, especiallycortisol and adrenaline (epinephrine), and the nervous system to release certainneurotransmitters, such as serotonin. Interestingly, adrenaline acts as aneurotransmitter and a hormone.The purpose of these secretions is to provide a surge of energy to enable thebody to react swiftly to a ‘non-ordinary’ stressor, especially a situation thatinduces emotions such as fear that can precipitate distress. When the stressorhas been resolved or removed, the level of secretions gradually returns tonormal and the body is restored to its normal state of homeostasis. If thestressor is not rapidly resolved or removed, the body will continue to releasehormones and neurotransmitters, which, at certain elevated levels, areassociated with adverse health effects, including neurological effects; anelevated cortisol level, for example, is associated with depression.Neurological effects are not, however, solely the result of emotional stressors;they can also be caused by physical stressors, such as toxic chemicals and EMradiation, both of which are known to adversely affect the nervous system; asindicated by the 2014 Supplement to the BioInitiative Report entitledNeurological Effects of Non-Ionizing Electromagnetic Fields, which states that,> “Factors that act directly or indirectly on the nervous system causing> morphological, chemical, or electrical changes in the nervous system can lead> to neurological effects.”It is claimed that at certain low doses or exposures, toxic chemicals and EMradiation do not produce adverse effects, but this is misleading; claims of thisnature completely ignore subtle effects at the cellular level; as Dr Blaylock MDexplains in Health and Nutrition Secrets,> “…subtle toxicities can disrupt cellular function without producing obvious> clinical toxicity – a condition known as subclinical toxicity.”Subclinical toxicity may also produce actual symptoms, but not of the type to beregarded as clinically significant. Symptoms of this nature are likely to beignored on the grounds that they are not indicative of a ‘disease’ recognised bythe medical establishment, whose attitude towards people with MCS and EHS wasdiscussed in chapter seven. Dr Blaylock describes some of the symptoms that maybe experienced,> “Rather than obvious signs such as nausea, vomiting and abdominal cramps, some> people may experience no more than vague feelings of fatigue, cloudiness of> thought, memory lapses, irritability, depression, or minor aches and pains…”Sadly, few doctors are likely to recognise that obvious symptoms, such as nauseaand vomiting, can result from the ingestion of toxins; most of them will ascribesuch symptoms to a ‘germ’ of some description. Dr Blaylock also explains thatdoctors are largely unfamiliar with signs of ‘subclinical toxicity’. This meansthat they are even less likely to associate subtle symptoms, such as ‘cloudinessof thought’ for example, with exposures to toxins or EM radiation; they are farmore likely to associate these symptoms with a mental health problem.The failure of physicians to recognise symptoms to be the result of exposures to‘harmful substances and influences’ is due to their medical training, which onlyteaches them to recognise certain symptoms or symptom-complexes as indicative ofthe presence of a specific ‘disease’, the cause or causes of which may not evenbe known. Their training also extends to the recognition of certain symptoms andsymptom-complexes as indicative of conditions referred to as ‘mental illnesses’,now known as ‘mental disorders’, the prevalence of which, according to the April2018 WHO fact sheet entitled Mental disorders, is increasing,> “The burden of mental disorders continues to grow with significant impacts on> health and major social, human rights and economic consequences in all> countries around the world.”The fact sheet refers to some of the conditions included in this category andstates that,> “Mental disorders include: depression, bipolar affective disorder,> schizophrenia and other psychoses, dementia, intellectual disabilities and> developmental disorders including autism.”The problems with the reference to depression as a ‘mental disorder’ werediscussed in chapter one; the erroneous nature of the idea that autism is a‘mental disorder’ was discussed in chapter seven. There are clearly similarproblems with all of the other ‘disorders’ listed above; dementia is discussedlater in this section.The basic features of the conditions referred to as ‘mental disorders’ aredescribed by the fact sheet that states,> “They are generally characterized by a combination of abnormal thoughts,> perceptions, emotions, behaviour and relationships with others.”As discussed in chapter one, the reference to ‘abnormal’ presupposes theexistence of a clearly defined description of ‘normal’; but this is not thecase. Although it may be appropriate to describe certain behaviours asunacceptable, it is inappropriate to attribute them to a mental illness. Moreimportantly, it ought to be a matter of profound concern to everyone that any‘authority’ possesses the right to determine the parameters of ‘normal’ in orderto ascertain what can be described as ‘abnormal’; especially with respect topeople’s thoughts, perceptions and emotions.Interestingly, and as previously cited, the fact sheet claims that the factorsthat contribute to mental disorders also include stress and exposure toenvironmental hazards; the discussion in this section demonstrates these to bethe major causal factors of neurological problems. The treatments recommended bythe WHO for ‘mental disorders’ do not however, include measures to properlyaddress these factors. Instead, treatments for many, but not all, of theseconditions, include the use of psychoactive drugs to correct a ‘chemicalimbalance in the brain’ that is claimed to be the main cause of these disorders;the erroneous nature of this claim was discussed in chapter one.Psychoactive drugs are entirely inappropriate as treatments, not only becausethey are unable to correct a problem that has never been proven to exist, butalso because they are known to cause severe harm to the brain. In his previouslycited article entitled Rational Principles of Psychopharmacology for Therapists,Healthcare Providers and Clients, Dr Breggin refers to,> “…the brain-disabling principle, which states that all psychoactive substances> work by causing dysfunctions of the brain and mind.”It can be seen that, yet again, medical ‘treatments’ have the ability to causethe very problems they are intended to remedy.It is extremely important to reiterate that, as Dr Breggin states in hisarticle,> “Withdrawing from psychiatric drugs can be emotionally and sometimes> physically dangerous. It should be done carefully with experienced> supervision.”Another reason that psychoactive drugs are an inappropriate remedy for ‘mentaldisorders’ is because they are utterly incapable of addressing any underlyingemotional problems that may have precipitated the ‘distress’. As previouslystated, problems can only be resolved by addressing their cause or causes.Unfortunately, however, pharmaceuticals have become widely accepted as thepanacea for many forms of ‘distress’; as Dr Breggin explain in his article,> “A huge portion of the general population accepts that psychiatric drugs are> the answer to everyday problems from fatigue and a broken heart to conflicts> in the family between parents and their children.”Children who conflict with their parents, or other adults, may be diagnosed witha condition known as ODD (oppositional defiant disorder), which is generallydescribed as a behavioural disorder, in which children display hostility,disobedience and defiance, often towards adult ‘authority’ figures. The medicalestablishment does not know what causes children to exhibit such behaviours, buta diagnosis of ODD requires the behaviours to have persisted for more than sixmonths; temporary tantrums are therefore excluded.Although children who exhibit these behaviours may have emotional problems thatcan be addressed through non-pharmaceutical-based therapies, they may also beaffected by factors that are entirely unrelated to emotional problems. The mostsignificant of these other factors are exposures to substances and influencesthat cause harm to the nervous system and produce neurological effects. Thesubstances that can impair neurological functioning include various foodadditives, such as the chemicals used as food colourings and preservatives, asdiscussed in chapter six. Other sources of chemicals that impair neurologicalfunctioning, especially of children, include vaccines, many of which containneurotoxic ingredients, as also previously discussed. The influences that canadversely affect the nervous system and cause neurological harm include RF-EMFs;children who use, or play with, mobile phones for example, will be exposed tothe harmful radiofrequency EM radiation they emit.Older people are another sector of the population claimed to be affected inlarge numbers by ‘mental disorders’; the most common condition with which peopleover the age of 65 are diagnosed is dementia, which is described by the WHO May2019 fact sheet entitled Dementia as,> “…a syndrome in which there is deterioration in memory, thinking, behaviour> and the ability to perform everyday activities.”Although more common in older people, dementia is not solely a problem forpeople over the age of 65. More importantly, as the fact sheet acknowledges,dementia is not an inevitable consequence of ageing; many people older than 65do not experience a deterioration in their mental faculties. The fact sheet doesnot identify the causes of dementia but instead, states that,> “Dementia results from a variety of diseases and injuries that primarily or> secondarily affect the brain, such as Alzheimer’s disease or stroke.”In addition to the statement that dementia can result from Alzheimer’s disease,the fact sheet also states that Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form ofdementia. But this is highly anomalous because it suggests that one of the mostcommon forms of dementia is a cause of dementia.Interestingly, although unsurprisingly, the fact sheet attempts to associatecognitive impairments, including dementia, with the same ‘risk factors’associated with ‘physical’ diseases, as indicated by the statement that,> “Studies show that people can reduce their risk of dementia by getting regular> exercise, not smoking, avoiding harmful use of alcohol, controlling their> weight, eating a healthy diet, and maintaining healthy blood pressure,> cholesterol and blood sugar levels.”The problems with this statement have been discussed; however, the fact sheetclaims that other ‘risk factors’ are also involved and states that,> “Additional risk factors include depression, low educational attainment,> social isolation and cognitive inactivity.”In the same way that the medical establishment explanations about ‘physical’diseases are flawed, those pertaining to ‘cognitive impairments’ are alsoflawed; they can however, be explained by reference to the ‘new’ explanation ofdisease. Cognitive impairments, including those referred to as ‘mentaldisorders’, are manifestations of dysfunctions, especially within the nervoussystem and the brain, resulting from exposures to ‘harmful substances andinfluences’. In some instances, these exposures may have occurred prior tobirth, as indicated by the discussions about the endocrine system and birthdefects in chapter seven.Significantly, the mechanism by which stressors exert their harmful effects isthe same as all ‘harmful substances and influences’, namely, oxidative stress,which has been shown to be associated with a number of ‘mental disorders’, asdiscussed in a 2009 article entitled Oxidative stress and anxiety which statesthat,> “Oxidative damage in the brain causes nervous system impairment. Recently,> oxidative stress has also been implicated in depression, anxiety disorder and> high anxiety levels.”One of the most common symptoms caused by the tensions and anxieties associatedwith ‘distress’ is a headache. However, although headaches are recognised to beassociated with the nervous system and neurological problems, they have beenredefined as ‘disorders’; as indicated by the April 2016 WHO fact sheet entitledHeadache disorders, which states that,> “Headache disorders are among the most common disorders of the nervous> system.”The fact sheet claims that there are four types of ‘headache disorder’:migraine; tension-type headache; cluster headache; and medication-overuseheadache. Although persistent headaches are clearly debilitating, it isinappropriate to refer to them as ‘disorders’. It is important to emphasise thatheadaches are one of the most common ailments for which people self-medicate;however, in common with all other ‘medicines’, over-the-counter pain-killers donot resolve or address the underlying problem. The category referred to as‘medication-overuse headache’ is yet another demonstration that treatments arecapable of causing the very problem they are intended to remedy.An increasing number of studies have discovered that oxidative stress is afeature of the most common ‘mental disorders’; as indicated by a 2014 articleentitled Oxidative Stress and Psychological Disorders, which also states that,> “…the fact that oxidative stress is implicated in several mental disorders> including depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder,> is not surprising.”However, a 2013 article entitled Good Stress, Bad Stress and Oxidative Stress:Insights from Anticipatory Cortisol Reactivity makes the familiar statementthat,> “…the mechanisms by which psychological stress promotes oxidative damage are> poorly understood.”This statement is, however, rather surprising; Dr Russell Blaylock, a formerneurosurgeon, explains in his 2006 book Health and Nutrition Secrets that stressincreases the rate of metabolism and that increased metabolism increases thegeneration of free radicals. In the absence of adequate levels of antioxidantsto counter them, free radicals will induce oxidative stress that can lead tofree radical damage at the cellular level. Prolonged distress, therefore, willcontinue the process of free radical generation and cellular damage that willresult in impaired functioning of tissues and organs, including those of thenervous system and brain.This process is particularly significant with respect to the two most commonneurodegenerative diseases; namely Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’sDisease (PD), both of which have been associated with high levels of oxidativestress; as reported in a 2017 article entitled Oxidative Stress inNeurodegenerative Diseases: From Molecular Mechanisms to Clinical Applications,which states that,> “The pathological mechanisms underlying the degeneration of dopaminergic> neurons have been correlated to overaccumulation of ROS or other free> radicals.”ROS are reactive oxygen species.The WHO anticipates that dementia will continue to increase in incidence andprevalence into the foreseeable future; the fact sheet claims that there areapproximately 50 million people around the world with dementia and that thisnumber is predicted to reach 152 million by 2050. The reason that the incidenceof dementia is anticipated to rise so dramatically in the next few decades isdue to expectations that people will achieve ever-increasing lifespans, eventhough the WHO acknowledges that dementia is not an inevitable consequence ofageing. The credit for increased life expectancy is attributed to ‘modernmedicine’, which is claimed to have reduced mortality, especially infantmortality, by successfully conquering deadly ‘infectious diseases’ throughvaccination programmes; the erroneous nature of this claim has been discussed.The real reasons that people, both young and old, experience cognitiveimpairments and neurological problems that may be diagnosed as ‘mentaldisorders’, are many and varied; but, like all other ‘diseases’, they are causedby exposures to various combinations of stressors, both physical and emotional.It has been demonstrated in this discussion that stressors exert their harmfuleffects through the same mechanism as all other ‘harmful substances andinfluences’; in other words, through the increased generation of free radicalsthat induce oxidative stress and lead to damage at the cellular level. It isclear therefore, that all stressors increase the utilisation of the body’ssupply of antioxidants. This inevitably places even greater emphasis on theimportance of good nutrition and the regular intake of antioxidant-rich foods to‘scavenge’ free radicals before they cause harm, and to provide support for thebody’s endogenous antioxidant production system. The nervous system, andespecially the brain, can also be protected by avoiding or at least minimisingexposures to substances and influences known to have harmful neurologicaleffects.Efforts to minimise exposures to stressors that can adversely impact the brain,and to increase the intake of protective antioxidants will not only help to slowdown and prevent deterioration of cognitive functions, but they can also help toimprove them. The reason for this is because another of the long-held beliefs ofthe medical establishment has been proven to be erroneous; this is the idea thatnew brain cells, also known as neurons, were not generated once they had beenformed at the age of about 3 years old. In the 1970s, researchers discovered thepresence of new neurons in certain parts of the adult brains of some animals.Continued research revealed that the generation of new neurons, also known asneurogenesis, occurs in many parts of the adult brain in many different animals,including humans. A 2008 article entitled Estrogen and Adult Neurogenesis in theAmygdala and Hypothalamus states that various factors may influence the rate atwhich new neurons may be generated. These factors include aspects of theexternal environment that can affect physiology and,> “…act on neurochemical and/or neurotransmitter systems to affect cellular> proliferation and/or survival.”It should be clear from previous discussions that there are many ‘environmentalpollutants’ that can act as physical stressors and contribute to neurologicaleffects.In the context of Dr Selye’s definition, ‘stress’ is an inevitable aspect oflife, but, as he explains,> “…we can learn a great deal about how to keep its damaging side-effects,> ‘distress’, to a minimum.”Prolonged stress that has become ‘distress’ can clearly be debilitating anddamaging to health. Although some stressors, such as the death of a loved one,may not be so easy to overcome, it is possible for people to take certainactions that will help to reduce their overall level of stress. The website ofDr Stephen Sinatra MD, for example, contains a page entitled How to HandleTension or Stress Headaches that discusses strategies including diet, relaxationand sleep. On this page, Dr Sinatra, who is one of the co-authors of thepreviously cited Earthing book, refers to the practice of grounding that can‘de-stress’ and help to re-balance the nervous system. He explains on the pageentitled What is Earthing or Grounding that,> “Emerging science reveals that direct contact with the ground allows you to> receive an energy infusion…”He refers to this energy infusion as ‘powerful stuff’ that,> “…can restore and stabilize the bioelectrical circuitry that governs your> physiology and organs, harmonize your basic biological rhythms, boost> self-healing mechanisms…”The human body clearly possesses mechanisms that are eminently capable ofrepairing damage to all areas of the body, including the brain, but thisrequires people to make every effort to avoid or minimise exposures to stressorsthat are harmful, as Dr Selye states,> “Only by intelligent adjustment of our conduct to the biologic rules is it> possible to achieve full enjoyment of eustress without distress.”"},{"pageContent":"> In Conclusion: How To Be Naturally Healthy> “Health is not something bestowed on you by beneficent nature at birth; it is> achieved and maintained only by active participation in well-defined rules of> healthful living…” Henry Bieler The health policy guidelines developed and issued by the WHO are recommended forimplementation by all Member States; they therefore have the ability to affectthe health of the entire world population. It may be assumed from the magnitudeof this responsibility that the WHO possesses a thorough understanding of theproblem it purports to be able to solve; it may also be assumed that themeasures recommended for the treatment and prevention of illness are not onlyappropriate but are also safe and effective; these would however, be mistakenassumptions. As the discussions in this book have demonstrated, ‘modernmedicine’ does not possess a thorough understanding of the nature of illness andhas failed to correctly identify all of its causes. They have also demonstratedthat the measures employed to treat and prevent disease, namely medicines andvaccines, are not only inappropriate, they are neither safe nor effective.Although modern medicine is claimed to be founded on evidence-based science, itis abundantly obvious that it has failed to solve the problem of illness; thiscan be demonstrated by a substantial volume of evidence that shows ill-health tobe a problem that continues to worsen rather than improve. It is clear thatmedicines and vaccines do not heal and prevent disease; but the problem withthese measures is not merely their lack of efficacy. There is a large andgrowing body of evidence that shows pharmaceutical products to be toxic andtherefore inimical to health, not supportive of it.The main reason that ‘modern medicine’ has failed to solve the problem ofillness is because it operates from the basis of fundamentally flawed theories;yet the medical establishment refuses to revise these theories, despite theirobvious flaws.In common with all other problems, that of ‘illness’ can only be solved byunderstanding its nature and correctly identifying its real causes. People canonly be restored to good health when the causes of ill-health have beeneliminated and therefore cease to exist; as indicated by Herbert Shelton whoexplains that,> “…full recovery cannot be expected so long as cause remains.”As stated in the Introduction to this book, health is the natural state of thehuman body, but achieving and retaining good health requires people to takecertain actions. The main actions involve making conscious decisions, firstly,to avoid, or limit, exposures to the factors that adversely affect health andsecondly, to increase exposures to the factors that improve health. In otherwords, it requires people to actively participate in ‘healthful living’, asexplained by Dr Henry Bieler in the quote that opens this concluding section ofthe book.Although most people trust the medical establishment as the ‘authority’ withrespect to illness, especially in the treatment and prevention of disease, thisis, unfortunately, a misplaced trust for reasons that have been discussedthroughout this book. It must be emphasised that authority is not synonymouswith ‘truth’. Authority, when not based on truth, can impede progress and evenprevent the discovery of truth; as indicated by a saying attributed to AlbertEinstein,> “Unthinking respect for authority is the greatest enemy of truth.”It is likely that, at the beginning of this book, most readers would haveconsidered the information in this book to have been controversial; it ishowever, appropriate at this juncture, to repeat the saying attributed to ArthurSchopenhauer,> “All truth passes through three stages. First, it is ridiculed. Second, it is> violently opposed. Third, it is accepted as being self-evident.”It is sincerely hoped that, having reached the end of this book, you, thereader, will have attained the third stage and recognise the ‘self-evident’nature of the information it contains. It is also hoped that, with your newunderstanding of what really makes you ill, you will feel you are now inpossession of the information you require to make truly informed decisions aboutyour healthcare."},{"pageContent":"> ReferencesThe references and web pages listed below were correct at the time of preparingthe book for publication; however, some web pages, especially WHO fact sheets,are dynamic and therefore subject to changes and updates.All WHO fact sheets are available from this web pagehttps://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheetsChapter OneWHO definition of health. www.who.int/about/mission/enBMA founding principle. www.bma.org.ukBae YH, Park K.

These fields both require an aptitude forlogic, which proved extremely useful for their investigation that has involvedmore than ten years continuous research to find answers to the question: whatreally makes people ill?A popular saying, which is often attributed to Albert Einstein, claims thatproblems cannot be solved by using the same way of thinking that created them.The concept underlying this saying can be extrapolated to indicate that aproblem can often be better understood by people outside of the discipline inwhich it occurs because they are not bound by any dogma or biases inherentwithin that discipline.The authors’ investigation of why people become ill was conducted from adifferent perspective from that of the medical establishment; it was thereforefree from the dogma and biases inherent within ‘medical science’. This unbiasedand logical approach enabled them to follow the evidence with open minds and ledthem to discover the flaws within the information about illness and disease thatis promulgated by the medical establishment.The results of their investigation are revealed within their book, What ReallyMakes You Ill? Why Everything You Thought You Knew About Disease is Wrong."}]
