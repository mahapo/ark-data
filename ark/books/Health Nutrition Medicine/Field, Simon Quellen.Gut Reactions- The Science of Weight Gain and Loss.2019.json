to weight problems. Whether it’s a low-fatdiet, a low-carbohydrate diet, a Paleolithic diet, a gluten-free diet, or anynumber of other magical things to try, they all claim that your problem issimple and has a simple solution.The popularity of these diets is linked to the observation that they all seem towork. Why would these different approaches to weight control all have success?One reason is that they all limit your choices. When you are not able to eateverything in sight, you tend to eat less. Another reason is that each diettargets a different set of people and works for that set, if not for others.Of course, they all work until they don’t. Limiting your diet in this way isdifficult to do for long periods of time.There aren’t many things that we expect to work for all people all the time.People are different from one another. There are genetic differences, culturaldifferences, behavioral differences, psychological differences, and socialdifferences, and they all play a part in the weight maintenance equation. Add tothese differences age, gender, gut microbiology, and environment and it becomesclear that weight control is a personal thing, and the solutions might have tochange not only with each individual, but also with time and setting.Obesity is not one disease. There are many subtypes of obesity. Some people willhave disorders in how their bodies manage energy balance, while others may havedifferences in how they respond to reward, making it hard for them to resisthighly palatable foods. There are many ways to affect our body compositiontoward more fat, and that is what this book is about.HOMEOSTASISHomeostasis is the word used for the body’s automatic system for weight control.Homeostasis means “staying the same” (from the Greek words for “similar” and“standing still”). It is very important for the survival of any organism.Without it, the animal starves to death, or feeds to death. Biological systemsthat are this important have many components, with several checks and balances,and interactions with other systems. Things get complicated.There are two kinds of weight problems that are related to homeostasis.Some people slowly gain weight all their life. A weight gain of a single pound ayear adds up over time, and by age 40 or 50, those 20 to 30 pounds of extraweight are noticeable in the mirror, on the scale, and in the doctor’s office.Other people find that they reach a particular weight and stay there, inhomeostasis, but at a weight that is unhealthy or otherwise undesired.In the first case, homeostasis isn’t working properly. In the second case, thecontrols are set higher than we’d like, and we want to change them.We keep many of our body systems in homeostasis. We regulate our temperature—wecan die if we get too hot or too cold. We regulate our blood pressure and ourblood sugar. Again, we can die if either gets too high or too low. Problems withblood sugar homeostasis cause diabetes. It turns out that all these othercontrol systems interact with the control systems for body fat. Disease and fatcan be correlated. Obesity is a risk factor for diabetes, and raising the bodytemperature during a fever burns fat.HISTORYAs I write this, over 68 percent of adult Americans are overweight, and over 35percent are obese. We know this isn’t just a little bit of weight gain over manyyears because 32 percent of children and teenagers are overweight, and 17percent are obese. They haven’t had time to accumulate their fat slowly. Butsince obesity rates do go up with age, some part of the problem is smallincreases over time.If these numbers had always been the same, we wouldn’t worry. We don’t worryabout obese elephant seals or hippos. Their fat percentages are normal for theirspecies and are essential for their survival. But humans have been gainingweight since the 1960s. While the percentage of people who are overweight butnot obese has remained fairly stable, the percentage of obese people has risenfrom about 13 percent in the 1960s to over 35 percent today (Ogden and Carroll2010).Image [images/3.jpg]Something happened between 1980 and now. The sharp corners in the graph aboveare an artifact caused by the fact that the data comes from surveys done atparticular times. Nonetheless, the overall trend is real. What changed in thoseyears that caused the rise? What has caused the rates to stabilize since 2010?We will look into those questions in the following pages.The fact that obesity rates changed in the late 1970s, and then stabilized inthe 2000s, is actually good news. It means that obesity rates can change. Whatwas done can be undone. In fact, the recent stabilization in growth is likelydue to new scientific knowledge about fat homeostasis, and as we make thatinformation more widely available, there is hope that obesity rates may fall asquickly as they rose.In preindustrial America (before 1900), the obesity rate hovered around 4percent, compared to 35 percent today.Some of the changes in the American diet since that time are related to thediversity of the foods available and the ease of preparing food. Beforesupermarkets, kitchen stoves, refrigerators, restaurants, fast food, and frozendinners, the variety of foods available was limited. Limiting choice in food isa form of dieting. Food becomes less interesting, and we eat when we are hungry,rather than when we are tempted.Another change in diet was the rise in consumption of polyunsaturated seed oils,rich in omega-6 fatty acids. We are eating three times the amount ofpolyunsaturated oil as we were before 1900. Also striking is our doubling ofsugar consumption in that period. Consumption of sweetened beverages is fivetimes what it was in 1900.Our food technology has also allowed manufacturers to improve the palatabilityof our food, at the same time they improve the appearance, shelf life, andmanufacturing efficiencies. Since 1970, Americans have increased the amounteaten per day by 425 calories, a full 20 percent, which may be due to acombination of a wide variety of foods available, the high palatability of thosefoods, the ease of eating them at a restaurant or out of the microwave, andother factors we have not (yet) discussed.If we are eating 20 percent more food than we were 45 years ago, is that whereall the fat is coming from? Not necessarily. The natural homeostasis systems inour body would normally do something with that food other than store it as fat.We would increase our metabolic rate and our level of activity. The fat cellswould produce signals that tell us we are full. Our stomach would stop producinghunger signals. Whether this is enough to overcome the temptation of eating allthat delicious food that is sitting right there in front of us is something wewill explore further later.If we eat 20 percent more food than we need, and it goes into making new fatcells, those cells will need food to survive. If we gain weight, we will needmore food just to move all that weight around all day. We can’t just say thatadding 425 calories per day adds some fixed amount of fat every day. We shouldexpect that the amount of added fat would decrease over time. The same mathworks in reverse. Dieting should eventually lead to a plateau in weight, as thelost calories will eventually lead to a lower metabolic rate and less activity,accompanied by an increase in hunger signals that causes you to cheat on thediet.The amount of exercise people got in the early 1900s (when the obesity rate was4 percent) is also likely more than what the average American is getting today.Transportation back then involved more walking. Work involved more moving aroundthan the typical desk job does today. Entertainment did not involve sitting infront of a screen at home. While these differences in the way society works andplays are not likely to change, individuals can choose to get more exercise, andwe have tools today that can monitor the number of steps we take and remind usto get up and walk around. I would not, however, expect that exercise is theanswer to weight loss. We burn nearly all our calories just staying warm,pumping blood, and thinking. If you were to go running for an hour a day, theextra calories you burn would be at most about 20 percent of your dailycalories. Then homeostasis would kick in, and you would relax for the rest ofthe day to make those calories up.We are also getting less sleep than people used to get. Sleep is important forregulating metabolism, and lack of sleep makes us hungry in two different ways,which makes us eat more. (More on this later.) Sleep can be disturbed as we foolour diurnal clocks by using artificial lighting and watching television,computers, or cellphone screens late into the night. In particular, getting bluelight after sunset can cause sleep abnormalities, and there is a lot of bluelight in our various electronic media—you can’t make white pixels on a screenwithout blue.Where you live can make a difference in your diet and the amount of exercise youget. At the top of the next page is a “heat map” of US counties, colored by thepercentage of obese people in the population.Image [images/6-1.jpg]There are clearly “hot spots” in the distribution. This is unlikely to be duesolely to genetics, as people in the United States have a high degree ofmobility and a diverse population. Likewise, cuisine does not vary enough toaccount for the distribution. There is a very good national food distributionsystem, and supermarkets across the country carry much the same kind of food.What does seem to correlate to a good extent is poverty. The United Statessubsidizes crops like corn, wheat, and sugar, and these high-carbohydrate foodsare easy to process into cheap addictive products with long shelf lives, easytransportation and storage, and lots of marketing.Image [images/6-2.jpg]In contrast, fresh fruits and vegetables are not easy to find in poorneighborhoods, and animal protein sources are expensive. Education about diet isalso an issue in areas with low education levels or where language barriersexist. Compare the locations of obese counties in the heat map to thehigh-poverty counties in the map on the bottom of the previous page.We see the same trends with other addictive substances, such as alcohol,tobacco, and recreational drugs.EATING FOR REWARDTwo changes in lifestyle have also contributed to the obesity problem. We havebecome very good at designing foods that are highly palatable. We joke aboutthese foods being addictive, but it turns out not to be a joke. These foodsstimulate the same reward circuits in the brain that other addictive substancesdo. We are eating for pleasure, long after we have satisfied our hunger. Thesatiety signals our homeostasis system is sending us are overridden by thereward. After a meal, we might turn down a second helping of broccoli because weare full. But we seem to have room for a dessert that has even more calories.This is partly because we are addicted to the reward, but also because sugar andwheat flour don’t produce the satiety signals that other foods do, so they don’ttell us to stop eating.The second change is the easy availability of these highly palatable foods. Wedon’t have to mix and bake our own cookies. They are in that big package in thecupboard. The ice cream is in the freezer, waiting for us. No blending ofingredients and hand cranking the ice cream maker. Wherever we go, there arevending machines full of candy bars. At every checkout counter, even at thehardware store, there is a rack of cookies and candy bars, and maybe even afreezer full of ice cream bars. The temptation to feed our addiction is everpresent.Someone addicted to alcohol and nicotine can avoid smoky bars, but everyoneneeds to shop for things, and all those delicious calories are there at thecheckout counter at the bookstore, the movie theater, the gas station, the toystore, and even the car wash. Many places have these foods available for free.Banks often have cookies or candy on a table by the door and at the tellers’windows. Car repair shops have an array of pastries next to the free coffee.Gyms and health food stores sell energy bars and protein bars that are basicallycandy by another name.Highly palatable foods act on the brain’s reward center. This bypasses thehomeostasis system in the brain. The homeostasis system will tell us we are nolonger hungry. The reward system will tell us that hunger does not matterbecause we are eating for pleasure, not to satisfy hunger. It is the rewardsystem that makes people addicted to nicotine, opiates, cocaine, andamphetamines.Highly palatable foods have been designed to be addictive. They contain sugar,salt, and fat, in an irresistible combination. They require almost no chewing.They melt in the mouth. They have a variety of flavors and aromas, usually inthe same bite. They are highly advertised and are easily available, andubiquitous, because they sell so well. Just like any other addictive substance.The brain becomes addicted by training. We are not born craving nicotine orchocolate chip cookies. We gradually program our brains to need these things,instead of just wanting them. We lose control. And as with all addictivesubstances, we can regain control by consciously changing our relationship withthe substance. Far fewer people smoke cigarettes in the United States than inthe 1950s. What used to be cool and attractive is now seen as a disgusting habitby many. If we decide to eat only when we are hungry, to think about how we willfeel after overeating or what the scale will read the next morning, we cangradually reprogram the brain away from addiction and regain control over oureating habits.Not everyone who is overweight is an addict, has a damaged homeostasis system,sleep disorders, bad genes, bad eating habits, neuroses, gut microbe problems(dysbiosis), unhealthy environment, or any particular one of the many reasonspeople are fat. But most of us, even those who are not fat, have at least oneand probably several of those issues. We are all different, and to take controlof our bodies, it helps to understand what our reasons and triggers are and howto overcome them. What works for one person might work for many or most butmight not work for all people.WHY ARE WE FAT?As a nation and, increasingly, as a planet, we’re fat. Why is that?It could be the types of food we eat. Early on, we thought the problem was thefat in our diet. We made a big deal about fat and created low-fat this andlow-fat that, and we got fatter. Then we thought that maybe it wascarbohydrates. Various diet plans that reduced carbohydrate consumption seemedto work for those who tried them and could stick with them. But we still gotfatter as a nation. There are people now claiming that the problem is with thelast of the three macronutrients: protein. We eat too much meat, they say.Maybe. We certainly eat much more protein than we need. We’ll look into allthese ideas in a bit.Are we getting less exercise than we used to? Probably. That seems likely to bepart of the problem, at least for some people. We work at desks now instead ofplowing fields and roping cattle. We drive instead of walking or riding horses.We have laborsaving devices to do most of the work we used to do. But of the2,000+ calories we eat each day, exercise doesn’t actually burn that many. Mostof the calories go into keeping us warm, keeping blood flowing, keeping usbreathing, digesting, and thinking—things we do even when we aren’t exercising.We get fatter as we get older, and as a nation, we are getting older.Maybe there’s something in the environment that causes us to overeat.Advertising. Cheap and abundant food. A wide variety of food. We eat out atrestaurants more than we used to. There are bigger portions at restaurants. Foodhas gotten more addictive as the makers of processed foods have learned thescience of creating foods we can’t pass up and can’t stop eating.Maybe it’s in our genes. Four-fifths of body mass index (BMI) is heritable. Ifyour parents were fat, you are likely to be fat. But is that because you are inthe same environment as your parents, or because they taught you bad eatinghabits?Personality plays a part. Conscientious people can stick to diets better, andmore neurotic people cannot. Are we less conscientious and more neurotic than weused to be?Perhaps we traded one vice for another. People are smoking a lot less thesedays, and people may have moved from an addiction to nicotine to an addiction tosugar, fat, and salt.We are finding out that our symbiotic gut bacteria have a lot to say about howmuch we eat and how well we digest it. Changing the gut bacteria in mice canmake lean mice fat and fat mice lean, and there are studies in humans showingsimilar effects. Have we changed the ecology in our lower intestines? There is alot of research showing that the typical American diet does just that, and in away, that makes us fatter. But is that everyone’s problem? Probably not. For anyparticular person, there may be several different reasons why keeping trim is achallenge, and those reasons will be different for each person.THE TYPES OF FOOD WE EAT CAN MAKE US FATBoth low-fat diets and low-carbohydrate diets help people lose weight (Hu et al.2012). Moreover, the amount of weight loss and the amount of waist circumferenceloss is generally about the same. If one or the other macronutrient—fat orcarbohydrate—were the cause of obesity, we would not expect equal results whenreducing either one while keeping total calories constant.There can be several reasons why both diets seem to work. By limiting the typesof food the individual is allowed to eat, we reduce the variety. Both fat andcarbohydrates (especially sugar) increase the palatability of food, improvingits taste and making it more rewarding. Reducing either one makes food lessappealing. Even when allowed to otherwise eat freely, people on low-fat dietsdid not compensate by adding calories (Kendall et al. 1991), and they lostweight.Simply thinking about tasty food causes the body to release insulin inanticipation of the meal. Insulin reduces blood sugar levels, making us hungry.What does the body do with the sugar from the blood? It does not throw it away.It does not burn it. It stores it as fat. If the food is less appealing, itmight not be as fattening, even if it contained the same number of calories as atastier meal.People vary in how they respond to insulin (insulin sensitivity) and how muchinsulin they produce after being given the same dose of glucose (insulinconcentration). In those with high insulin concentration (an indicator of lowinsulin sensitivity), a low glycemic load diet caused faster weight loss than alow-fat diet (Ebbeling et al. 2007). Reducing the sugar load reduces theinsulin. So while in general we can say a low-carbohydrate diet is as good as alow-fat diet, the results for any particular person can depend on that person’sinsulin sensitivity, and perhaps other differences as well: genetics, gutmicrobes, exercise levels, etc."},{"pageContent":"2Image [images/conical.jpg]SUGARS AND OTHER CARBOHYDRATESSUGARSugar is everywhere in the American diet. A 12-ounce can of sugared soda has 39grams of sugar. To get that same amount of sugar, you’d have to eat 3½ cups ofunsweetened applesauce. This may be why most applesauce sold in the UnitedStates has been sweetened to double the amount of sugar (SugarStacker 2016).While we know that there is sugar in soft drinks, sugar is added to almosteverything, from ketchup to salad dressing, and it can be hard to avoid, or evento know when it is being consumed.It is difficult to consume too much sugar from easy-to-find sources in nature.Our ancestors would have found some sugar in fruit, where it is packaged withwater bound to fiber, so it is quite filling. And their access to fruit waslimited by the seasons; in the winter and spring, they would have found it quitehard to come by. In the supermarket, on the other hand, what passes for fruitoutside of the produce section is often some highly processed treat whose firstthree ingredients are forms of sugar, such as the fruit snacks whose ingredientlabels are shown on the next page.Sugar is an easy way to get calories, especially when it is in liquid form, asit is in soft drinks. No chewing is required, no preparation, no cooking—justthe sweet stuff. A teenager who would be hard pressed to consume 6 or 9 cups ofapplesauce can easily consume two or three cans of sugared soft drink at a mealor a party. But there is more to the problem of sugar than that. Sugarinterferes with the homeostasis systems in the body. It raises blood sugarlevels quickly. This is a dangerous condition, and the body responds by sendinginsulin into the blood. Insulin’s job is to tell the fat and muscle cells toremove the sugar from the blood by storing it as fat. After this rush ofinsulin, the blood is now low in sugar, making you hungry again. Therefore, youeat more of what was in front of you. More sugar.Image [images/14.jpg]After we eat most unprocessed foods, glucose is released into our blood slowly,and insulin levels don’t spike sharply. There is enough time for the insulin totell the brain we aren’t hungry anymore, and we stop eating. The blood sugarlevels don’t suddenly plummet; they remain regulated. Insulin decreases theproduction of the hunger-stimulating hormone ghrelin. Insulin increasesproduction of the satiety hormone leptin, making us feel satisfied (satiated)(Teff et al. 2004).Fruit juices are just as bad as soda. The fiber has been removed from the fruit,so it is not there to fill the stomach and tell us we’ve had enough. Thesejuices are little more than sugar water. What tiny amount of nutrition is leftin the juice is not significant, and almost anything you substitute for thejuice, such as whole fruit, is likely to be more nutritious.Sugar is an addictive substance (Avena, Rada, and Hoebel 2008). Sugar releasesopioids and dopamine into the brain, just like opiates and other drugs such asnicotine and cocaine. The pleasure and reward systems in the brain arestimulated. Excessive sugar intake (sugar bingeing) is one indication ofaddiction, as are withdrawal, cravings, and “cross-sensitization” (increasedsensitivity to stimuli that accompany the addictive drug) (Avena and Hoebel2003). People who are more prone to addictive behavior—alcoholics,ex-alcoholics, smokers, ex-smokers, etc.—are more prone to addiction to highlypalatable foods and exhibit those same four indicators (Davis 2013).Sugar is hidden in most processed foods. In some, it is listed plainly as thefirst ingredient, as it is in the package of raisin pastry shown below.Image [images/15.jpg]This is clearly a dessert, although it was being served as a breakfast in thehotel I recently visited. Malted barley flour is another term for sugar. Whenbarley is allowed to germinate, in a process known as malting, it producesenzymes that convert the starch into glucose, a simple sugar. Other sugarsmentioned on the ingredients label are dextrose (another word for glucose), cornsyrup, and corn syrup solids.Another dessert masquerading as a breakfast is sweetened cereal. When sugar isthe second ingredient, what you are eating is dessert. But in many cases, sugaris also the third, fourth, and fifth ingredient, under slightly different names.If the peanut butter, dextrose, corn syrup, brown sugar syrup, and molasses wereadded to the sugar instead of listed separately, we might see sugar properlylabeled as the first ingredient.Image [images/16.jpg]Other names for sugar found in processed foods include invert sugar, invert canesyrup, tapioca syrup, malt flavor, or as many as 100 different names.A single sugar-sweetened soft drink per day is enough to measurably increasechildhood obesity and increase body mass indexes (BMI, a proxy for body fatfraction) in children (Ludwig, Peterson, and Gortmaker 2001).There is good news for anyone considering giving up sweets, including artificialsweeteners. It turns out that after a couple months of little or no sugar in thediet, the brain and tongue reprogram themselves to detect much lower amounts ofsweet. Things that never tasted sweet before (because they were being drownedout by the huge sugar load in the modern diet) now taste sweet (Wise et al.2015).In nature, sugar is usually found in the form of sucrose, a molecule composed oftwo simple sugars, glucose and fructose.Image [images/17-1.jpg]SucroseImage [images/17-2.jpg]GlucoseImage [images/17-3.jpg]FructoseThe gray atoms are carbon, the red atoms are oxygen, and the white are hydrogen.We call them carbohydrates because they are made of carbon and water (you cancount the hydrogens to see there are two of them for every oxygen).Your body has to use a tiny bit of energy to break the sucrose molecule apartinto the two simple sugars. The glucose can be used immediately by the muscles,brain, and other organs. The fructose is sent to the liver for processing.FRUCTOSEFructose does not raise insulin levels. Thus, the appetite-stimulating hormoneghrelin is still produced, and we still feel hungry. The satiety hormone leptinis not produced, so we don’t feel full. The glucose receptors in the brain’shypothalamus that tell us to stop feeding are not activated. The tasty food isstill in front of us, and our homeostasis mechanisms aren’t kicking in to stopus from overeating.Image [images/17-4.jpg]Eating a high-fructose meal leads to high levels of fat (triglycerides), evenwhen the same total number of calories is controlled for (Teff et al. 2004).About 30 percent of the fructose is turned into fat in the liver. Much of thisextra fat is stored in the liver, where it was produced, not in fat cellselsewhere in the body. Excess liver fat causes the same kind of liver disease asexcess alcohol consumption. It is called “nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.” Fatin and around the liver (known as visceral fat, abdominal fat, or “beer belly”)is the dangerous fat associated with heart disease, stroke, and diabetes.Not all the fat made from the fructose is stored, however. Some of it leaks outinto the blood as free fatty acids. Those cause the muscle cells to become lesssensitive to insulin. They no longer hear the signal to burn glucose, so theglucose must be removed from the blood by the fat cells, which store it as fat.In the liver, fructose metabolism creates the inflammatory molecule JNK1, whichhas the effect of interfering with the insulin receptors in the liver cells. Theliver becomes insensitive to insulin, so it does not hear the insulin signaltelling it to stop converting stored glycogen into blood sugar. Blood sugarrises, prompting more insulin production. The muscle and liver aren’t listeningto that signal, so the fat cells have to remove the sugar and store it as fat.While this book is about obesity, fructose does more damage than simply addingfat. It causes heart disease by making the liver produce too much uric acid(Johnson et al. 2007). Uric acid raises blood pressure by reducing nitric acidproduction. (Nitric acid is the molecule that makes blood vessels dilate,lowering blood pressure—it is what nitroglycerin pills release into the blood torelieve angina.) Uric acid is what causes the disease gout.The high insulin levels raise blood pressure. Combined with the uric acid thatprevents the blood vessels from getting the nitric oxide signal to dilate, wenow have two signals leading to hypertension, or high blood pressure. The highinsulin levels also interfere with the brain’s leptin receptors. Leptin is thehormone that tells the brain to stop eating. Leptin also reduces the rewardsignals in the brain that we get from eating, so eating more isn’t as much fun.Without the leptin signal, we still get the reward from the fructose, and wekeep eating. Eating fructose not only makes us fat, it makes us hungry. We eatmore and get fatter still.Fructose is sweeter than sucrose and much sweeter than glucose. That is whymanufacturers of processed food are adding more fructose to their products. Highfructose corn syrup is more than half fructose, and the two simple sugars(glucose and fructose) are already broken apart, unlike in natural sugar(sucrose).Fructose affects the brain differently than glucose does. Fructose increasesfeeding, while glucose decreases feeding. Instead of relieving hunger, fructosemakes us eat more (K. Page et al. 2013). Besides the brain, fructose has effectson visceral fat, blood fats (triglycerides linked to heart disease and stroke),and decreased insulin sensitivity (seen in prediabetes and type 2 diabetes)(Stanhope et al. 2009).Unlike other foods, fructose does not suppress the hormone ghrelin (produced bythe stomach to make you feel hungry). It has all the calories of glucose, but itdoes not relieve hunger.Like alcohol, the body cannot store fructose, so the liver must deal with itimmediately. This means that any remaining carbohydrates, such as glucose, gostraight into storage in fat cells. Since table sugar (sucrose) is half glucose,half of the calories go into fat storage instead of being burned in the muscles.Fructose causes oxidative damage by increasing free oxygen radicals that damagetissues. Free oxygen radical control is why doctors recommend eating antioxidantfoods. Fructose causes inflammation that leads to atherosclerosis and diabetes,among other ailments (Saygin et al. 2016).Fructose is seven times more likely than glucose to produce advanced glycationend-products (AGEs). AGEs are made when sugars like fructose bind to proteinsand fats. Our bodies have receptors for AGEs, because they are dangerous. Werespond by producing chronic inflammation, which causes kidney damage, fibrosis,atherosclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, obesity, and other complications ofdiabetes. AGEs also cause high blood pressure by blocking the action of nitricoxide, the molecule that expands blood vessels. That they are called AGEs isfitting, since they cause many of the problems associated with aging. Althoughfructose is the main culprit, even mildly elevated blood glucose levels resultin higher AGE levels.The process for making high fructose corn syrup was invented in 1957, and sincethen manufacturers of processed food have been increasing the amount of it inuse. It is inexpensive, and its sweetness can be easily manipulated by varyingthe amount of fructose. Some formulas have 42 percent fructose, while othershave 55 percent to 90 percent. Americans get 17 to 20 percent of their dailyenergy intake from fructose. There seems to be a direct relationship betweenincreased fructose consumption and increases in obesity, metabolic syndrome, anddiabetes. Other symptoms of fructose consumption are insulin resistance,increased fats in the blood (called dyslipidemia), impaired glucose homeostasis,increased body fat, and high blood pressure. The effects of fructose in the dietare in part due to the changes in gut bacteria that a high fructose dietpromotes (Payne, Chassard, and Lacroix 2012).ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERSMost people who want to lose weight already know they should cut down on sugaror completely eliminate it. But the attraction of sweets makes that difficult.The pleasure we get from sweet things can be so profound as to cause an actualaddiction. So how about those calorie-free miracles of science that are sowidely available in every diet soda or low-calorie dessert? Can’t we just switchto artificial sweeteners, have our cake, and eat it with every meal?Image [images/20-1.jpg]Aspartame is 180 times sweeter than sugar.Of course, it isn’t that easy. Many of the problems with sugar remain withanything that tastes sweet. The sweetness receptors are still sending signals tothe brain, telling us to eat more of this delicious stuff, even long after weare no longer hungry. If the sweet food has any calories at all, that leads toovereating. But even if the diet soda is completely calorie free, it stillcauses problems, simply because it is sweet.Image [images/20-2.jpg]Sucralose is 600 times sweeter than sugar.Our bodies have sweet sensors in many places, not just on the tongue. We havethem in the gut (Steinert et al. 2011), the pancreas (Nakagawa et al. 2009), inother organs, and in the brain. When these sensors detect something they thinkis sugar, they send their signals to the body to prepare for the availability ofsugar (Malaisse et al. 1998). The pancreas injects insulin into the blood, whichthen tells fat cells to remove sugar from the blood and store it as fat. Theresult is that we have low blood sugar, which makes us hungry. Drinking thatdiet soda makes us want to eat, even if we were not hungry before we drank it.It makes us convert blood sugar into fat, when without the diet soda, we mighthave burned that blood sugar to feed our muscles and stay warm (Swithers 2013).Image [images/21-1.jpg]Neotame is 8,000 times sweeter than sugar.Artificially sweetened beverages are associated with increased body mass index(BMI) and increased body fat percentages, elevated risk of coronary heartdisease, elevated risk of hypertension (high blood pressure), as well as doublethe risk of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes (Swithers 2013).Image [images/21-2.jpg]Acesulfame-K is 180 times sweeter than sugar.Another effect that noncaloric sweeteners have is to reduce the ability ofsweet-tasting foods to signal satiety. The body learns that sweet does not meancalories. Therefore, when we do get real sugar, we don’t respond by eating less(Swithers 2013). When artificially sweetened beverages are consumed along withsugar-sweetened foods, we eat more.Image [images/21-3.jpg]Saccharin is 300 times sweeter than sugar.Just as with sugar, consuming a lot of artificially sweetened foods andbeverages trains the tongue and the brain to ignore the signals of sweetness infoods. Once we give up sugar and artificial sweeteners, after a few weeks, weregain the ability to sense the sweetness in fruits and vegetables, increasingthe palatability of healthier foods. Where we might think that we would miss thesweetness of candies and pastries, we regain the delights of natural fruits ascompensation.Image [images/22.jpg]Sodium cyclamate is 30 to 50 times sweeter than sugar.Artificial sweeteners have yet another downside. They change the composition ofour natural gut microbes, reducing our tolerance for glucose (Suez et al. 2014).Because we don’t digest artificial sweeteners, they pass directly into the largeintestine, where the beneficial gut bacteria live. Any harmful change in gutbacteria is called dysbiosis. One study found that over 40 different types ofbacteria changed in abundance with a diet including artificial sweeteners,causing metabolic problems such as those that lead to diabetes and obesity (Suezet al. 2014). The bacteria that were favored by the artificially sweetened dietwere the ones that produce the short-chain fatty acids acetate and propionate,which are signal molecules the body uses to control the production of glucoseand fats, and which also affect satiety. The types of bacteria favored by theartificial sweeteners are the same ones found in the guts of people with type 2diabetes and obesity.STARCHFor hundreds of years before the war on dietary fat began in the 1960s, doctorsthought they knew why fat people were fat: too many starchy foods. There weren’tthat many fat people, but they all seemed to be eating lots of starchy food:bread, puddings, potatoes, cakes, pasta, cereals, and gravy, all with lots ofstarch. Reduce the amount of starch you eat and you won’t be fat—that was thewisdom then.But things changed. We decided fat was the enemy. We decided that the USDepartment of Agriculture should be in charge of deciding what we should eat,through a thing called the food pyramid, which placed starchy agriculturalproducts at the base, telling us that a quarter of our plate should be full ofstarch, which was renamed “complex carbohydrate.”And we got fatter as a nation. We exported our ideas and our agriculture to therest of the world, and they got fat too.As more food on the market became processed food, starch took over thesupermarket. Most of the center aisles are full of starch. Pasta. Bread. Soupsfull of potatoes and noodles. Corn chips. French fries. Mashed potatoes. TaterTots. Hash browns. Cookies. Flour. Rice. Cornmeal. Cornstarch. Tapioca. Pudding.Potato chips. Ramen. Spaghetti. Macaroni. Bakery aisles and whole bakeriesinside the store.Starch lends itself very well to processing. It can be shaped and modified. Itcan be extruded, formed, and cut by machines that make vast quantities ofprocessed foods in seconds. It can be made crisp or soft. It can thicken liquidsto make them more appealing or coat other foods with an attractive brown crust.It gels into a paste, holding water, which adds moist mouthfeel and cheap bulkand weight.Manufacturers learned to make starch more attractive, appealing, and addictiveby further processing. Flour mills now make flour extremely fine, unlike thecoarser stone-ground flours of old. The superfine flour allows the starch grainsto be rapidly digested into the sugar maltose by enzymes in saliva. The starchhas turned into sugar almost before you swallow. The maltose is quickly brokendown further by the small intestine, where it splits into two molecules ofglucose. The flood of glucose from the quickly digested slice of bread causes arush of insulin into the blood to handle the overload. The glucose turns intofat, and the blood glucose levels fall, and we are hungry again. Time to buymore manufactured agricultural products. It’s almost as if someone planned it.TYPES OF STARCHThere are two types of starch: amylose and amylopectin.Amylose is a simple chain of glucose molecules all linked together. It usuallywinds around in a helix shape, like a spring. Sometimes it can be in a singlehelix shape, as shown below:Image [images/24-1.jpg]At other times, it may be in a double helix shape. In the image below, we havecolored one helix red and the other blue:Image [images/24-2.jpg]These helixes can stick together with what chemists call hydrogen bonds, and getrather stiff. In a reaction called retrogradation, a solution of amylose inwater (a gel) will lose water and start to crystallize. The amylose crystalsbecome much less water soluble, and the enzymes that normally break up starchescan no longer reach into the crystal to break apart the glucose molecules. Wesay that this form of starch is “resistant starch.” It acts much like fiber. Wedon’t get calories from it. It goes down into the large intestine, where itfeeds the same beneficial gut bacteria that feed on fiber. Those bacteriaproduce the short-chain fatty acids propionic acid and butyric acid, which areabsorbed into the blood and tell the brain we have had enough to eat. Butyricacid in the colon is also believed to be important in preventing colon cancerand other colonic diseases (T. Wang, Bogracheva, and Hedley 1998).This retrograde crystallized stiff starch is what makes stale bread hard. Infresh bread, the amylose is still in its gel form and can be easily digested byenzymes in saliva. In a hot baked potato, the amylose is also in gel form. Butin cold cooked potatoes, such as in a potato salad left in the refrigeratorovernight, the amylose has had time to crystallize and become resistant. Theportion of the starch that is resistant has effectively zero calories and allthe benefits of fiber.Most sources of starch—wheat, potatoes, rice, etc.—are only about 20 percentamylose. The rest is one of three forms of amylopectin.Amylopectin is also made up of chains of glucose molecules. However, it has abranched structure that makes it fluffy and easy for the digestive enzymes toaccess. When cooked, it opens up and accepts water easily, forming a gel thatdoes not crystallize and get stale. Unfortunately for dieters, this means thatall its calories are quickly available. The ease with which amylopectin can bedigested into glucose is why white bread has a higher glycemic index than puresugar. Only half of the sugar is glucose, while all of the amylopectin is.The image below is a small fragment of an amylopectin molecule, showing a singlebranch point, with each glucose molecule shown in a different color to make iteasier to pick them out.Image [images/25.jpg]Below is another fragment, this time of a helix with another helix branchingfrom the center. Here we have colored the many glucose units with graduallychanging colors, since there are so many.Image [images/26-1.jpg]Amylose molecules are large, but amylopectin molecules are huge, with up to acouple million glucose molecules in each amylopectin molecule. As the moleculegets larger, the branching and spiraling make it fluffy and globular, as thefragment below shows:Image [images/26-2.jpg]There are three types of amylopectin. Type A is found in most cereal grains,such as wheat. Wheat is generally about 26 percent amylose and 74 percentamylopectin A. Type B is found in bananas and potatoes. It is less easilydigestible than type A, so more of it ends up in the large intestine to feed thegood bacteria. It releases glucose into the blood more slowly than type A,producing less insulin response. The least digestible form, type C, is found inbeans and legumes. More of it makes its way to the large intestine, where thebacteria ferment it into the gas those foods are famous for.Because amylopectin is so quickly digested, it raises insulin levels quickly.Anything that does this eventually leads to insulin resistance, a key componentof metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and obesity (Byrnes, Miller, and Denyer1995).The relative amounts of amylose and amylopectin differ in food from differentplants. Even in the same plant—wheat, oats, potato, etc.—there are differentcultivars with different starch ratios. One type of corn (waxy maize) has beendeveloped to be 100 percent amylopectin, since that starch is preferred for manyindustrial uses.Starch is stored in plants in tiny granules of semicrystallized amylopectin andamylose. In older milling processes, the kernels of grain would be ground toflour that kept these granules intact for the most part. In modern millingmachines, the flour is ground into superfine particles where the starchmolecules can more easily react with water to form gels. This fine flour is veryquickly turned into glucose during digestion. This means the starch will quicklyraise blood glucose levels, causing insulin levels to spike, so the glucose isstored in the body as fat.Starches can be divided into three groups based on the speed of digestion. Thequickly digested, high-amylopectin A starches, such as those in wheat flour, arein one group. More slowly digested starches such as beans and legumes form asecond group. The third group is the resistant starches such as those found incold cooked potato stored long enough for the amylose to crystallize. To controlweight and avoid type 2 diabetes, reducing or eliminating the first type is agood idea.If your starch source has at least 50 percent amylose (but preferably 70 percentor more), both blood sugar and insulin levels will be significantly reducedcompared to starches with lower amylose (high amylopectin) ratios (Behall andHallfrisch 2002). This effect is independent of whether some of the amylose hasbecome resistant or not; in other words, it is digested but more slowly, soglucose and insulin do not rise as much (Granfeldt, Drews, and Björck 1995).Image [images/28-1.jpg]ALCOHOLImage [images/28-2.jpg]Alcohol relates to obesity in several ways. Alcohol affects the same opioidreceptors in the brain that eating rich food does. People who are more prone toalcoholism, because of variations in the genes that code for opioid receptors,are more prone to bingeing on sweet and fatty foods. They are more likely tobecome addicted to either of these, as well as to opiate drugs, cocaine, andnicotine.Alcoholic drinks are empty calories for the most part. A 12-ounce beer cancontain anywhere from 55 calories for the lightest of light beers to well over300 calories. A glass of wine is around 125 calories. Those calories are notcoming from protein or fat. They are from alcohol itself and from sugars andstarches. They do not satisfy hunger. In fact, like sugar, they actuallyincrease hunger (Suter and Tremblay 2008). Moreover, people do not compensatefor their alcohol calories by reducing food intake (Westerterp-Plantenga andVerwegen 1999). The alcohol calories are on top of their normal dietarycalories, just as the calories from soft drinks are. Drinking alcohol makes useat faster at a meal and spend more time eating (Jéquier 1999).Alcohol has 7 calories per gram. That is almost twice as much as sugar, starch,or protein has, and almost as much as the 9 calories per gram that fat has. Thebody cannot store alcohol like it can store glucose or fat, so it has to burnthe alcohol immediately to get rid of it. Any other calories you consume in themeantime go straight to your waistline.At some point in alcohol overconsumption, the amount of alcohol the liver canburn through exceeds its capacity, and the toxin must be removed in other ways,such as converting it to the fatty acid acetate. By this time, however, you aredefinitely drunk. And while you may excrete some amount of the fatty acid inyour urine, your body can absorb acetate and keep those calories as fuel. Inalcoholics and other chronic drinkers, a separate pathway to detoxification iseventually triggered in order to get rid of the alcohol, and some part of it isdirectly oxidized, producing only heat. This occurs only when the liver cannotburn the incoming alcohol fast enough, so most of the calories have alreadydisplaced food calories, which went into fat instead of being burned (Lieber1987).Alcohol inhibits fat burning. The fat that is not burned is preferentiallydeposited in the abdomen (Suter and Tremblay 2008).Heavy drinkers add anywhere from 1,000 to 3,000 extra calories to their dietevery day. Compare that to a normal day’s calories of 2,000 to 2,500. Heavydrinking also makes it difficult to get exercise. When it is difficult to walk,you are unlikely to be playing a lot of tennis.Alcohol negatively affects sleep and growth hormone levels (Prinz et al. 2009).Disturbed sleep causes stress, which causes obesity. Human growth hormone (HGH)increases muscle mass and decreases fat mass. When it is in low supply, fat massrises, at the expense of muscle.About 15 percent of the calories in alcohol go into thermogenesis—creating bodyheat. This compares with 25 percent for protein calories, 8 percent forcarbohydrate calories, and 3 percent for fat calories (Jéquier 1999). Theremaining 85 percent of the calories from alcohol are available to the body asenergy and are used before energy from food sources, leaving that for fatstorage.DIETARY FIBERFiber in the diet has many effects relevant to weight control. It is filling,yet has no calories. It absorbs and retains water, aiding satiety. It slows theemptying of the stomach. It decreases hunger without adding calories.An additional 14 grams of fiber per day is associated with a 10 percent decreasein energy intake and a weight loss of over a pound a month (Howarth, Saltzman,and Roberts 2001). Moreover, these effects are greater in obese individuals thanin lean ones. Since the average American’s fiber intake is only 15 grams perday, this is effectively doubling the average intake, to reach theAMA-recommended 25 to 30 grams per day.Image [images/30-1.jpg]A small fragment of the fiber pectin.In a study of female nurses, those with the highest fiber intake had a 49percent lower risk of weight gain than those with the lowest intake (Liu et al.2003). Fiber intake correlates with lower body mass index (BMI) no matter howmuch fat is in the diet (Slavin 2005).Foods high in fiber take longer to eat. Consider the 250 calories in a vanillalatte compared to the same 250 calories in 10 carrots. Not only is the lattefinished in less time than a single carrot, but 10 carrots is a meal that leavesyou quite full, whereas the latte just makes you hungrier. The time it takes toeat your calories matters quite a bit. It takes time for your body to registerthat you have eaten enough. If you eat your whole meal in 20 minutes or less,you won’t have time for the satiety signals to develop or reach your brain. Youwill eat until you are stuffed, instead of eating until you are no longerhungry. The difference can be several hundred calories per meal, and that addsup to pounds.Image [images/30-2.jpg]A small fragment of the fiber inulin.Fiber reduces the rate at which the intestines absorb carbohydrates. Thisreduces the insulin response, since it is sensitive to the rate of glucoseabsorption more than to the amount of glucose.Fiber speeds the food through the small intestine. This allows the food to getto the large intestine sooner. It is in the large intestine that the satietyhormone PYY is produced, telling us to stop eating. Fiber tells us we are fullsooner, so we don’t keep eating more calories.Fiber attaches to free fatty acids, so they don’t get absorbed as easily in thesmall intestine. When they reach the large intestine, the beneficial bacteriathere chop them up into short-chain fatty acids, which act as a signal tosuppress insulin production in the pancreas. Without the fiber, more of thefatty acids remain as long-chain fatty acids, which have the opposite effect.Long-chain fatty acids increase insulin production. They also make muscle cellsless sensitive to insulin.Besides weight management, high levels of dietary fiber are associated withlower risk of heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes, and manygastrointestinal diseases. Fiber reduces cholesterol in the blood. Soluble fiberimproves insulin sensitivity and glycemia. Fiber improves immune function byfeeding beneficial bacteria in the large intestine.Image [images/31.jpg]A small fragment of the fiber beta-glucan.In a study comparing a high-fiber diet (50 grams per day) to one with 24 gramsin diabetic patients, the high-fiber diet reduced cholesterol absorption by 10percent, improved blood glucose and insulin levels, and reduced glucose levelsin the urine (Chandalia et al. 2000).Dietary fiber comes in two forms: soluble and insoluble. The soluble form iswhat makes gels and raises the viscosity of the stomach contents. Insolublefiber speeds digestion and causes some of the energy intake from the diet to endup being undigested. The soluble form is digested by gut bacteria producingshort-chain fatty acids, which are then absorbed by the gut. This leads tohigher amounts of energy being absorbed. Of course, replacing fat andcarbohydrate with fiber, even soluble fiber, results in reduced energy intake.The soluble fibers are what reduce cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood.There are two mechanisms by which soluble fiber reduces cholesterol in theblood. Fiber binds to bile acids in the intestines. Bile acids are derived fromcholesterol, so when the fiber binds to them and carries them out of the body,new bile acids must be formed from cholesterol in the blood. Bile acids areneeded in order to digest fats and fat-soluble vitamins. They act like detergentto break up fat globules into tiny bits that can be absorbed.The second way fiber helps to reduce cholesterol in the blood happens when thefiber feeds the beneficial bacteria in the large intestine. These bacteriaferment the fiber and produce short-chain fatty acids: acetate, propionate, andbutyrate. These short-chain fatty acids act like hormones in the body and changethe rate at which cholesterol is synthesized in the liver and small intestine.Acetate increases the rate of cholesterol synthesis, while propionate reducesit. Many of the butyrate-producing bacteria in the gut eat acetate as theirfuel, resulting in less acetate getting into the bloodstream.Image [images/32.jpg]Bile acid acts like a detergent to digest fats.Butyrate is the principal fuel for the cells lining the large intestine(colonocytes). Without it, they die. Lack of sufficient butyrate is implicatedin colon cancer. Butyrate is also an inflammation moderator, withanti-inflammatory effects, which are important in weight management becauseinflammation is a key aspect of obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, andcoronary heart disease."},{"pageContent":"3Image [images/conical.jpg]FATS AND PROTEINDIETARY FATFor years, the accepted medical wisdom was that eating fat made you fat. Itseemed to make sense. Dietary fat has more calories per gram than protein orcarbohydrates, the other two macronutrients. We gave up fat and replaced it withsugar, and we got fat on low-fat diets.Worse still, the kinds of fats we started to eat were the worst types. Wereplaced lard and butter with hydrogenated vegetable oils and cheap seed oilshigh in inflammatory omega-6 fatty acids and low in healthy omega-3 fatty acids.We considered saturated fats to be the worst kind, because we thought theycontained only calories, unlike unsaturated fats, which the body requires tomake important tissues and molecules.We have since learned that dietary fat is important for health and weightmanagement. Grass-fed butter has important omega-3 fatty acids. Saturated fats,especially those containing medium-chain triglycerides such as butter andcoconut oil, are important for brain function, promoting healthy gut bacteria,controlling inflammation, and raising your metabolic rate.Dietary fat relieves hunger, unlike the sugar and processed starches thatreplaced it. Consequently, we ate more, demanded larger servings at restaurants,and bought bigger dinner plates.To understand how your body processes and uses dietary fat, it helps to lookinto the chemistry of it. After all, the words we use, such as triglycerides,fatty acids, omega-3, omega-6, saturated, and unsaturated, are all wordsborrowed from chemistry.Fats and oils are made of a small molecule called glycerol, to which areattached three molecules called fatty acids. This is why we call themtriglycerides.Image [images/34-1.jpg]The glycerol molecule is shown above. The carbon atoms are gray, the oxygenatoms are red, and the hydrogen atoms are white.Fatty acids are chains of carbon atoms with an oxygen atom at one end, whichbinds to the glycerol, and hydrogen atoms are attached all around. The simplestfatty acid is formic acid, which has a single carbon atom.Image [images/34-2.jpg]Formic acidOther simple fatty acids (called short-chain fatty acids), containing two,three, and four carbon atoms, are acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid,respectively:Image [images/34-3.jpg]Image [images/34-4.jpg]Image [images/34-5.jpg]When three fatty acids are attached to a glycerol molecule, we get atriglyceride, which is what we know as an oil or a fat. The simplesttriglyceride would be glycerol triformate. It is made from three formic acidmolecules attached to the glycerol molecule (the three carbons in the center).Image [images/35-1.jpg]Glycerol triformateMost of the oils and fats you might be familiar with contain much longer fattyacids, with chains of carbon that are eight atoms long or longer, up to as manyas 38. The longer the chain, the more likely the resulting molecule is to besolid.Saturated fatty acids are those with only single bonds between the carbons. Theyare called saturated because they have as many hydrogen atoms as will fit on themolecule. Single bonds allow the molecule to rotate and bend easily, andsaturated fats can thus pack together easily, so they can cluster closely andbecome a solid. This ability to pack tightly makes them useful as a way to storecalories in an animal or in a seed.A common saturated fatty acid found in animal fats and cocoa butter is stearicacid. It has 18 carbon atoms in its chain:Image [images/35-2.jpg]Unsaturated fatty acids have at least one double bond in the chain. A doublebond has two carbon atoms that are joined by two bonds. Since each carbon atomcan have only four bonds, those two carbons can have only one hydrogen atomeach. Double bonds can’t rotate—they are like a door with two hinges and canonly swing side to side. This means unsaturated fats don’t pack as easily assaturated fats do, so they are more likely to be liquids. An example of anunsaturated fat is oleic acid, on the right.Image [images/35-3.jpg]You can see the double bond in the center. Oleic acid is a monounsaturated fattyacid. This means it has only one double bond. Fatty acids with more than onedouble bond are called polyunsaturated fatty acids.A triglyceride can have any of the fatty acid types attached to its glycerolbackbone. As an example, adding one saturated fatty acid (palmitic acid), onemonounsaturated acid (oleic acid), and one polyunsaturated acid (alphalinolenicacid) gives us 1-oleoyl-2-palmitoyl-3-a-linolenoyl-glycerol:Image [images/36.jpg]Unsaturated fatty acids are categorized by where the double bond is located onthe carbon chain. We number the carbons from the end opposite from the glycerol.We use the Greek letter omega to refer to the last carbon (omega is the lastletter in the Greek alphabet). A fatty acid that has a double bond between thethird and fourth to the last carbons is an omega-3 fatty acid. If the doublebond is between the sixth and seventh carbons from the end, it is an omega-6fatty acid. Oleic acid is an omega-9 fatty acid. Its double bond is between thecarbon atoms that are ninth and tenth from the end.The trans fatty acids are those where the hydrogen atoms attached to the doublebond carbons are on opposite sides of the carbons. If the hydrogen atoms are onthe same side, as they are in oleic acid, we say they are cis fatty acids.Converting oleic acid from the cis form to the trans form gives us elaidic acid:Image [images/37.jpg]Trans fatty acids are formed when fats are overheated, as they are when naturaloils are artificially hydrogenated (adding hydrogen to some of the double bondsto make them more saturated). This used to be a common way to make cheap seedoils into solids more like lard or butter. The result was margarine andshortening, cheaper alternatives to the animal fats.Trans fats have been found to increase the bad form of cholesterol (LDL) morethan the saturated fats they were designed to replace. Trans fats also increaseinflammation, which leads to heart disease, obesity, and diabetes. They now mustbe listed in ingredients labels so they can be avoided, and as a result, theiruse has fallen considerably.Not all trans fats are harmful, however. Several natural trans fats are actuallybeneficial. Dairy fat contains trans-palmitoleic acid, which has been found tobe protective against type 2 diabetes, and thus heart disease. Test subjectswith high blood levels of this trans fatty acid were found to be 60 percent lesslikely to develop diabetes than those with the lowest levels in their blood(Mozaffarian et al. 2010; Mozaffarian et al. 2013).While saturated fats can raise cholesterol in the short term (a few weeks),long-term studies have shown the association to be weak or nonexistent. Manysaturated fats, such as stearic acid and medium-chain triglycerides, areactually beneficial to heart health. Large studies have found that saturated fatintake has no association with heart disease, and that saturated fat is actuallybeneficial in preventing stroke (Yamagishi et al. 2010).The types of fat in the diet affect our health in many ways. Some fatty acids(arachidonic acid [AA]) cause inflammation, which causes obesity and diabetes,while others (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) reduceinflammation. Some fats (medium-chain triglycerides) increase our metabolicrate, causing us to burn more calories.Some fatty acids cannot be manufactured in the body, so we must get them fromfood, as they are important building blocks of cell membranes and otherbiological structures. These are called essential fatty acids. Humans lack theenzymes needed to insert double bonds at the omega-3 and omega-6 carbons, so theessential fatty acids are all omega-3 or omega-6 fats. The two shortestessential fatty acids are the omega-6 fat linoleic acid (LA) and the omega-3 fatalpha-linolenic acid (ALA). All the longer essential fatty acids can be madefrom these by enzymes that add carbons or add double bonds, but it is obviouslymore efficient to get them premade from the diet. The importance of DHA and EHA,and the inefficiency of creating them from ALA, make these two omega-3 fattyacids important dietary components. They are found mostly in seafood such asoily fish, but the best source is krill, a crustacean. Krill oil has the omega-3fatty acids bound to phospholipids that make them more available to the body.Krill oil also contains astaxanthin, a flavonoid that also increases thebioavailability. The astaxanthin in krill oil is one of the more potentantioxidants (better than vitamin E and beta-carotene), and can help prevent thefatty acids from oxidizing and consequently becoming rancid (Naguib 2000).Astaxanthin is 48 times better than fish oil and 34 times better than thecoenzyme Q10 as an antioxidant (Massrieh 2008).Image [images/38-1.jpg]Image [images/38-2.jpg]The two fats shown above are linoleic acid (LA) and conjugated linoleic acid(CLA). They are the same except that in the second one the double bond has movedfrom the omega-6 carbon to the omega-7 carbon (the seventh from the last insteadof the sixth from the last).Linoleic acid is an omega-6 fatty acid, but not one of the inflammatory ones. Itis benign as a dietary food source, although high insulin levels cause enzymesto convert it into inflammatory arachidonic acid. Conjugated linoleic acid hasmany health benefits: fighting cancer, obesity, atherosclerosis, asthma, highblood pressure, high cholesterol, insulin resistance, and osteoporosis, andimproving immune function (Bhattacharya et al. 2006). Pertinent to obesity, thecombination of CLA and exercise lowers fat and increases lean body mass(Bhattacharya et al. 2005).Bacteria in the gut convert linoleic acid into conjugated linoleic acid. Cowsfed on grass produce milk with substantially more CLA than grain-fed cows. Thesame goes for beef cattle—those fed on grass have more CLA.DIETARY FAT AND OBESITYPart of the obesity problem is that we stopped eating enough fat. Fat in thediet reduces hunger. We feel full. Satisfied. When we replaced fat with sugarand processed carbohydrates, we started eating more at each meal, and morebetween meals, because calorie for calorie, those foods don’t satisfy hunger aswell as fat does. Some carbohydrates, like fructose, actually make us hungrierthe more we eat them.We also were eating the wrong kinds of fat. Trans fat and cheap seed oilscontain inflammatory fatty acids that cause insulin resistance. Inflammation ofthe brain causes leptin resistance. Leptin is the hormone fat cells produce totell the brain we have had enough to eat. Too much omega-6 fat (particularlyarachidonic acid) in relation to omega-3 fats in the modern industrial dietleads to more inflammation and obesity.Omega-3 fats reduce inflammation. Medium-chain triglycerides raise our metabolicrate, so we burn calories faster, even when not exercising.Fat cells that are not completely full are healthy. They can pull glucose fromthe blood to make glycerol and pull fatty acids from the blood to attach to theglycerol to make triglycerides for storage. Stored triglycerides are not just asource of energy in lean times. They are a way of removing harmful glucose andinflammatory fatty acids from the blood. Insulin is a signal to them to do this.When the blood contains high levels of the inflammatory fatty acid known asarachidonic acid (AA), the healthy fat cells remove it from the blood.Image [images/39.jpg]Arachidonic acidBut when the levels of AA in the fat cell become too high, the body defendsitself by generating new fat cells. The signal to do this comes from breakdownproducts of arachidonic acid. The new fat cells help to remove fat from theblood so it does not get stored in muscles and other organs where it can betoxic. This is called lipotoxicity (Sears and Ricordi 2010).A problem arises when levels of arachidonic acid in the fat cell become toohigh. The AA converts into inflammatory compounds called eicosanoids, and theseinterfere with the fat cell’s ability to respond to insulin.Image [images/40.jpg]Prostaglandin is an eicosanoid formed from arachidonic acid.The flow of glucose into the fat cell is interrupted, and it can no longer takeup fatty acids from the blood. Now the fat cell cannot remove AA from the blood.Fatty acids build up in the blood and muscles, where they interfere with insulinsignaling, so the muscles don’t burn glucose. The fat cells that are too fullnow start releasing fatty acids into the blood, making the situation worse. Atsome point, the AA levels in the fat cell become so high the cell dies. Thiscauses macrophages to enter the fat tissue to clean up the debris from dead fatcells. They release inflammatory molecules that cause further inflammation inthe fat tissue, further reducing insulin sensitivity. These molecules alsomigrate to the liver, where they cause it to produce C-reactive protein. Doctorsuse levels of C-reactive protein as a marker for chronic inflammation.When the fat cells are busy creating inflammation, diseases of inflammation,such as diabetes and heart disease, start to show up.About a third of obese people have genes that make their fat cells produce moreof the hormone adiponectin than other people (adiponectin will be discussed inmore detail in the chapter on hormones, page 89 [008_Chapter05.xhtml#page_89]).These people are protected from inflammation and its consequences. For the restof us, getting high levels of the omega-3 fatty acid EPA can stimulate fat cellsto produce more protective adiponectin.Adiponectin reduces insulin resistance, so the fat cells can do their job, andit stimulates the production of new healthy (empty) fat cells that are able toremove glucose and fatty acids from the blood (Sears and Ricordi 2010).Image [images/41.jpg]The omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)PROTEINA key component of recent popular diets such as Atkins and Paleo is therelatively high consumption of protein. There are several reasons why obese andoverweight people benefit from extra protein. For children and lean individuals,extra protein may not be beneficial and may actually cause problems.High-protein diets are associated with impaired glucose tolerance, reducedinsulin sensitivity, and increased incidence of type 2 diabetes (Chen and Yang2015).Eating protein causes levels of the appetite suppressant hormone glucagon torise more than eating an equal number of calories of carbohydrate. Calorie forcalorie, protein curbs hunger better than carbohydrates (Arafat et al. 2013) andfat (Keller 2011) do. The satiety effect of a high-protein diet cannot beexplained by changes in the other appetite-regulating hormones ghrelin andleptin (Weigle et al. 2005). Protein may also increase the brain’s sensitivityto leptin.Protein targets satiety, thermogenesis (body heat production), energyefficiency, and body composition (fat ratio) (Keller 2011).When we eat anything, the rate at which we burn calories for heat(thermogenesis) goes up. But for protein it increases by 20 to 30 percent, whilefor carbohydrate it increases by 5 to 10 percent, and for fat it increases by atmost 5 percent (Keller 2011).Eating protein while losing weight preserves muscle mass as well as bone mass.In a study of subjects who had just completed a very low-calorie diet, one groupwas assigned a diet with 18 percent of calories from protein, while the othergroup got 15 percent of calories from protein. Those getting more proteinregained half as much weight as the control group, and that weight was lean bodymass, not fat. This was attributed to two factors: the higher satiety of thehigh-protein diet, and the reduced energy efficiency (Westerterp-Plantenga etal. 2004). Lean body mass recovery is important, as the weight loss from thevery low-calorie diet was 61 percent from fat and 39 percent from fat-free mass(muscle, bone, water).In another study, subjects assigned high-protein diets and low glycemic indexdiets both fared better than controls at maintaining weight loss, and thecombined group (high protein and low glycemic index) did even better (theeffects were additive). All groups were allowed to eat as much as they wishedfrom the selected foods. There is a genetic component to whether high-protein,low glycemic index diets are effective in people, but two-thirds of people havethe genotype that makes this diet effective (Astrup, Raben, and Geiker 2015).In one large-scale randomized controlled trial, the DioGenes trial, 932 obesefamilies were studied through an eight-week, 800-calorie-per-day diet, followedby six months of five different diets that allowed them to eat all they wanted,while controlling for how much protein and which kind of carbohydrate (lowglycemic index vs. high glycemic index) they ate.The group that ate a high-protein, low glycemic index diet kept the weight lossfor over a year (the period of the study), while the other groups graduallygained the weight back (Astrup, Raben, and Geiker 2015). Of the two dietcomponents, the protein was more important than the low glycemic indexcarbohydrates in keeping off the weight.In that trial, fewer of the high-protein, low glycemic index group dropped outof the trial, indicating that this diet was easier to stick to. This group alsolost 5 percent more weight than the other groups. The low glycemic index dietersalso lost 5 percent more than the high glycemic index dieters.The take-home lesson from the study was that subtle changes in diet compositioncan have a major impact on calorie intake in real-life situations. Thecombination of high protein with low glycemic index had an additive effect.Either one was good, but both together was better. That the diet was easier tostay on also had a noticeable effect.On the downside, getting too much protein eliminates one of the benefits ofweight reduction—the increase in insulin sensitivity (Smith et al. 2016). Thediets studied showed that the high-protein diet reduced the loss in lean musclemass by 45 percent—an important finding—but at the cost of no improvements ininsulin sensitivity. On a lower-protein (but still low-calorie) diet, insulinsensitivity improved. The protein content of the diets was 1.5 grams perkilogram versus 0.8 grams per kilogram. For a 150-pound woman, that would be 81grams of protein per day versus 54 grams.Further concern about extra protein, especially animal protein, centers aroundthe timing of its consumption in children. Getting too much dairy protein at theage of 1 year is associated with extra body fat at year 7, and body fatpercentage at year 7 correlates well with body fat percentage later in life.Getting too much animal protein in years 5 and 6 is associated with obesitylater in life (Günther et al. 2007). Vegetable protein did not have this effecton future weight gain.Infant formula has 50 to 80 percent more protein than breast milk, and there isa higher incidence of later obesity in formula-fed babies than in breast-fedbabies. Moreover, in transitioning from milk to solid foods, there is, in manypopulations, a rapid increase in protein intake, exceeding proteinrecommendations by up to five times as much.Cow’s milk, but not meat or vegetable protein, may stimulate insulin andinsulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), two hormones that act throughout the body tochange both body composition and how we react to foods. Specifically, these twohormones affect the differentiation and proliferation of preadipocytecells—cells that go on to become either beige or white fat cells. The timing ofthis protein intake seems to be important, with the age of 12 months beingcritical (Günther et al. 2007). Dairy protein consumption later in life had noeffect on future weight gain. There are indications that the bovine whey proteinis what stimulates insulin secretion, so presumably cheeses would have a lessereffect.The age of 12 months is when children transition from milk-only diets to thosecontaining solid food. An excess of dairy protein at this time seems to lead tolater weight gain. Other animal protein and vegetable protein don’t have anynegative associations with later obesity.In an intervention study, replacing formula containing 11.7 percent of caloriesfrom protein with formula containing only 7.1 percent of calories from proteinled to growth at age 2 more like that of breast-fed children. For comparison,human breast milk contains only 5 to 6 percent of calories from protein(Koletzko et al. 2016)."},{"pageContent":"4Image [images/conical.jpg]PHYSIOLOGY AND PSYCHOLOGYSLEEPSleep disorders and obesity go hand in hand. Sleep apnea (pauses in breathing orshallow breaths while you sleep) is caused by insulin resistance associated withabdominal fat (Vgontzas, Bixler, and Chrousos 2003). But waking up frequently inthe middle of the night from lack of oxygen is not the only obesity-relatedsleep disorder. A disorder known as “excessive daytime sleepiness” is caused bytumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6, two chemical messengers producedin excess by the abdominal fat tissue in obese people. These molecules act onthe brain in the areas where sleep and wakefulness are controlled, in additionto their many other effects throughout the body. The levels of these twochemical messengers rise with increases in body mass index (BMI). The fatter weare, the more daytime sleepiness happens.People with other symptoms of insulin resistance are more likely to have sleepdisorders than people with normal insulin sensitivity. For example, ovariancysts and diabetes are associated with sleep disorders, likely by the samemechanisms.Getting rid of abdominal fat leads to improvements in sleep. The most dramaticexamples of this happen with the most drastic interventions. Gastric bypasssurgery leading to dramatic weight loss can reduce or eliminate sleep apnea.Men, with their greater propensity to accumulate abdominal fat (beer belly) thanwomen, who tend to distribute the fat more than men, are also more likely tohave sleep apnea (Vgontzas, Bixler, and Chrousos 2003). In women, sleep apneatends to occur after menopause, when fat distribution becomes more male-like.Sleep apnea caused by obesity and insulin insensitivity causes stress due tolack of sleep. This stress causes the release of cortisol (a stress hormone),which further increases obesity and insulin resistance.Lack of sleep for any reason, such as night shift work, has a similar result. Itcauses stress, which releases stress hormones, which cause obesity and insulinresistance.Sleep is an important modulator of metabolic function (how much we eat and howfast we burn it) and endocrine function (hormone production). It also modulatesthe cardiovascular system, with effects on blood pressure. Sleep deprivationstudies have shown that 60 hours without sleep reduces insulin sensitivity(VanHelder, Symons, and Radomski 1993). In a study where healthy youngvolunteers were allowed only four hours of sleep per night for six days, glucosetolerance was significantly lowered (Spiegel, Leproult, and Cauter 1999).Self-reported “short sleepers” also had impaired glucose metabolism compared tocontrol groups that got enough sleep.Lack of sleep makes you hungry. Levels of ghrelin (the hunger-stimulatinghormone produced by the stomach) go up. Levels of leptin (the satiety hormoneproduced by fat cells) go down (Taheri et al. 2004). This double whammy causesus to eat more (Spiegel et al. 2005). Conversely, a shortage of food leads todecreased or disturbed sleep. The same molecules that cause wakefulness byacting on the brain’s hypothalamus also stimulate food intake. We get hungry. Onthe other side of the equation, as we start to sleep, the levels of the satietyhormone leptin start to rise. It is easier to sleep when we don’t feel hungry.Most mammals sleep in short bouts, whether they sleep at night or during theday. Humans, however, sleep in 7- to 9-hour consolidated periods. This meansthat there is an extended period of fasting, when a sleeping human is noteating. During sleep, blood sugar levels stay fairly level. In contrast, duringfasting while awake, glucose in the blood falls continually. The body has anumber of mechanisms for keeping blood sugar levels constant during the sleepingfast.While a person sleeps, cortisol levels fall. This would be expected, since sleepis seldom stressful. This period of low cortisol levels increases insulinsensitivity. Conversely, disturbed sleep is stressful, and leads to insulinresistance and obesity.Human growth hormone levels, especially in men, are stimulated during sleep. Inmen, 60 to 70 percent of all growth hormone secretion happens during sleep.Human growth hormone (HGH) is produced in the pituitary gland at the base of thebrain. It fuels growth and development in children but is still produced inadults, where it has some effect on reducing fat and increasing muscle mass.Obese adults have lower human growth hormone levels in the blood than leanadults do. Older adults have less HGH than younger adults. We will discuss HGHin greater detail later (page 107 [008_Chapter05.xhtml#page_107]). For now, itis sufficient to mention that most of it is secreted while a person is asleep,and that it increases muscle mass and decreases fat mass.The hormone melatonin controls the sleep-wake cycle.Melatonin levels are controlled in part by the amount and type of light we’rein. Blue light, such as daylight sky, or light from television and computerscreens, inhibits melatonin and prevents sleep. Older adults make smalleramounts of melatonin, leading to less sleep. Melatonin stimulates HGHproduction, so less melatonin means less sleep and less HGH. Seasonal affectivedisorder, where low light levels during the temperate winter cause depression,is sometimes treated with over-the-counter melatonin supplements. Melatoninsupplements are also used for night shift workers and for treating jet lag andinsomnia.Image [images/47.jpg]Melatonin controls sleep.Ghrelin (an appetite-stimulating hormone) increases from midnight to dawn inthin people but not in obese people. This indicates that obese people have aflaw in their circadian rhythms, the same rhythms that make us sleepy at night.In the past 30 years, we have seen obesity rise to epidemic levels. Over thesame time period, the average duration of nightly sleep has fallen from eight tonine hours to only seven hours per night (Bose, Oliván, and Laferrère 2009).Nowadays, 30 percent of all adults in the United States sleep less than sixhours per night. The results are increased BMI and insulin resistance.STRESSWhen there is a challenge to the natural homeostasis of an organism, we callthat “stress.” The reaction to stress is to produce a physiological reaction toregain equilibrium. This takes the form of behavioral and physical adaptations,such as increasing cognition (your brain gets sharper), increasing theproduction of glucose by the liver, through the breakdown of both muscle andfat, and inhibiting reproduction (Bose, Oliván, and Laferrère 2009).There are two systems involved in the stress response: the autonomic nervoussystem (ANS) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. They worktogether to activate one of two responses: the “fight-or-flight” reaction or the“defeat response” reaction (where the animal loses the fight). The latter is thepredominant stress response to modern life and is primarily handled by the HPAsystem. The HPA system is the stress response system associated with upper-bodyobesity, metabolic syndrome, and depression.The hypothalamus is the organ in the brain that releases corticotropin-releasinghormone (CRH) and stimulates the pituitary gland to release adrenocorticotropin(ACTH). ACTH tells the adrenal glands to release the stress hormone cortisol andother glucocorticoid hormones.Glucocorticoid hormones interact with many systems in the body, including thosegoverning hunger and satiety. They interact with insulin and the hormoneneuropeptide Y to increase hunger and food-seeking behavior. People taking theartificial glucocorticoid drug prednisone note appetite stimulation and eatmore. Long-term use of such drugs can produce Cushing’s syndrome, characterizedby substantial upper-body obesity.Image [images/49-1.jpg]Adrenocorticotropin (ACTH)Mental stress has been shown to cause an increase in blood levels ofinterleukin-6, a key inflammatory molecule (Dandona, Aljada, and Bandyopadhyay2004). Stress can induce inflammation, which induces obesity. Stress interfereswith glucose homeostasis in diabetics, exacerbating their condition.Image [images/49-2.jpg]Interleukin-6 protein structureStress hormones such as cortisol, epinephrine (adrenaline), and norepinephrinehave all been linked to obesity, and chronic stress affects insulin and glucosemetabolism through these hormones and through their receptors. Epinephrine inparticular lowers leptin levels, which increases hunger.There is a difference in the brain chemistry between acute stress and chronicstress. Acute stress is the reaction to an isolated stressful event, such as anaccident, getting a bad grade, sleep deprivation, getting fired, moving to a newhouse, etc. In acute stress, the brain sends signals to the adrenal glands,which produce hormones called glucocorticoids, which increase attention andarousal, among many other effects (Dallman et al. 2003). But then comes aninhibiting signal that quenches the glucocorticoids after about 18 hours. Thistype of negative feedback is common in most control systems, and it keeps thesystem balanced.Chronic stress switches the brain into a different mode. After about 24 hours ofstress, the negative feedback signal diminishes, and the brain enables the“chronic stress-response network.” This network is associated with a variety ofcoping mechanisms. These include salience, where attention is focused on thestressor or other environmental cues that may or may not be related (Dallman etal. 2003). Things start to stand out from the background. Things that arerewarding become much more important, often to the point of becoming compulsive.With chronic stress, the levels of glucocorticoids stay high, since the negativefeedback control is reduced. Glucocorticoids cause muscle to be broken down sothat its component amino acids can be used in the liver to make glucose. Theyinhibit growth hormone, whose normal effect is to prevent this muscle wastageand to mobilize fat stores instead. This reduces calorie efficiency.Glucocorticoids cause us to desire more sugar and fat and other rewarding foods,and at the same time shift the fat storage from under the skin (subcutaneousfat) to abdominal fat.Negative feedback is crucial to any control system. In the chronicstress-response network, the negative feedback comes from two sources that aredifferent from that in acute stress. One is the reward system in the brain. Whenwe are rewarded, glucocorticoid levels drop. This is why we call certain highlypalatable foods “comfort foods.” They actually do comfort us in situations wherethe stress levels have been high for a long time.The second feedback signal comes from abdominal fat deposits. As we compulsivelyfeed on comfort foods, and the glucocorticoids move fat from under the skin tothe central abdominal area, the abdominal (visceral) fat increases. Thisvisceral fat sends signals to the brain to reduce glucocorticoid levels. Thebody is saying that we have enough stored fat to get us through the stressfulsituation. By the time this happens, we have dangerous levels of abdominal fat,with its association with diabetes, stroke, hypertension, and other aspects ofmetabolic syndrome.The compulsions caused by elevated levels of glucocorticoids lead to eatingdisorders such as bingeing and night-eating syndrome, in which most of the day’scalories are eaten at night. People with these disorders report beingchronically stressed (Dallman et al. 2003). The foods they binge on aretypically high in sugar and fat. These people are also, not surprisingly,usually obese. The glucocorticoid levels in these people are only slightlyelevated.In people with anorexia nervosa, on the other hand, the levels of the stresshormone cortisol (a glucocorticoid) are very high and insulin levels are verylow, yet these people still have higher levels of abdominal fat thansubcutaneous fat.In both groups, rates of depression are very high. Related to this is a commonside effect of antidepressants, increasing obesity.The difference between binge eaters and anorexics is how they try to cope withthe stress. Binge eaters are trying to reduce the cortisol levels through thereward system, while anorexics are using the seeking or escape mechanisms.Glucocorticoids are what make rats run on wheels. They induce seeking (what therats are running toward) and escape (what they are running from). When we removetheir adrenal glands, the rats stop using the running wheel.Self-medicating stress-induced depression with a pint of Ben & Jerry’s ice creamis not a healthy long-term strategy. Take a tip from rats and instead go for awalk or a jog. Stress-relieving activities such as yoga, meditation, andexercise can be done for much longer periods, with much better outcomes.DEPRESSIONTen percent of the population suffers from depression, and 35 percent of thepopulation suffers from obesity, so it is to be expected that the two conditionswill be found together. However, depression can cause obesity, and obesity cancause depression, so the incidence of each is much more than merely statistical(Stunkard, Faith, and Allison 2003).Obesity can cause low self-esteem and social isolation, which are knowncontributors to depression. Obese people are also prone to inflammation, whichresults in joint pain, diabetes, and high blood pressure, all of which arelinked to depression (Luppino et al. 2010).People with depression are more likely to become obese. Depression stimulatesweight accumulation (Dandona, Aljada, and Bandyopadhyay 2004). People who aredepressed make poor food choices, are more likely to overeat and less likely toexercise, and become more sedentary. Low levels of the hormone serotonin—a majorcause of depression—cause people to self-medicate by eating rewarding comfortfoods.Image [images/52-1.jpg]SerotoninForty-three percent of adults with depression are obese, compared to only 33percent of adults without depression (Pratt and Brody 2014). People with bipolardisorder or recurrent depression with low levels of cortisol suffer frommetabolic syndrome, obesity, and high cholesterol more than other people do(Maripuu et al. 2016).Image [images/52-2.jpg]CholesterolDepression and obesity are both exacerbated by low social class and lack ofphysical activity, making the coincidence of both diseases more likely. Bipolardisorder and recurrent depression are associated with a 10- to 15-year reductionin life expectancy. Cardiovascular disease is a strong contributing factor(Maripuu et al. 2016).As obese depressed people lose weight, many also lose their depression. A yearafter bariatric surgery to lose 77 percent of body weight, patients alsoexperienced an 18 percent reduction in symptoms of depression. On the otherhand, the more severely depressed someone is, the more likely he or she is to beor become obese (Pratt and Brody 2014).The link between depression and obesity seems to be tied to sex, race, and age.Men under 60 show no association between depression and obesity, while thoseover 60 do, as do women of all ages (Pratt and Brody 2014). Non-Hispanic blackand Mexican American men and women show no association between the two diseases.In patients who were over 20 years old, being overweight was associated withdepression, but this was not the case with younger patients (Luppino et al.2010). The longer patients suffered from depression, the more likely they wereto become obese. Obese subjects had a 55 percent increased risk of depression,and depressed subjects had a 58 percent increased risk of becoming obese(Luppino et al. 2010).Inflammatory hormones called cytokines can cause both obesity and depression.Hormones associated with inflammation affect the brain, causing sadness,fatigue, altered sleep patterns, and social withdrawal. The same hormones (seethe section on inflammation, page 167 [011_Chapter08.xhtml#page_167]) also causeobesity. Treating obesity by removing inflammatory omega-6 fatty acids andstarches from the diet, and adding anti-inflammatory polyphenols (the moleculesthat give vegetables their colors), may also help to treat depression.Image [images/53.jpg]Inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)The two problems share other aspects as well. Depression and obesity can both becaused by stress. Some symptoms of depression, such as binge eating, cancontribute to obesity. People who succumb to temptations while on a diet can beunduly hard on themselves, causing further stress. Treating both problemssimultaneously, with the help of health professionals, usually works better thantreating either condition alone.AUTOMATIC EATINGAutomatic eating is eating without thinking about whether you need to eat. Youeat because the food is there.It may be that your plate is too full, and that you or your server was notpaying attention to proper serving sizes (no portion control). You clean theplate because it’s there, not because you are hungry.At dinner, you might be in a stimulating conversation with someone, and thetable still has food on it. You serve yourself more food without thinking aboutit. You could have stopped eating a while ago, but the food was just there. Toavoid this, fill the plates in the kitchen with reasonable portions and bringthe plates to the table. If diners really need a second helping, they can get upand go to the kitchen. But most second helpings aren’t something people thinkabout. They eat because the food is there, not because they are still hungry.At a movie, sitting there with a huge tub of buttered popcorn, you keep reachingin and stuffing more into your mouth, but if someone had taken the bucket awayhalf an hour ago, you would not have noticed or minded. Again, portion controlcould have helped here. Get a smaller bag of popcorn.At a party, there is food everywhere, and it is all delicious high-fat,high-sugar, high-salt goodies that feed your addiction. You can’t just eat alittle and stop. Your brain forgets that you said to stop, and the eating goeson automatically, sometimes to the point of bingeing. If you are dieting, telleveryone you have already eaten your daily allowance, and carry a glass of wateraround to sip whenever you are tempted to grab a bite. People will delight inyour misery and help you by pointing out that you said you weren’t going to eatthat cookie you have in your hand. Let them help.You pass by the refrigerator on your way out and can’t help but look inside. Youaren’t hungry; it has just become a habit. Put the carrots and celery in thefront so you see them every time you open the fridge. If you don’t feel likeeating a carrot, you aren’t really hungry. You are just looking to feed youraddiction to addictive foods.On the counter is a box of cookies or a bag of chips. Throw those away, andeither leave the counter empty or replace the addictive foods with a bowl ofapples or some nuts. Again, if the apple doesn’t look like what you want to eatright now, you aren’t really hungry. If you find that you have added raisins andM&M’s to your bowl of nuts, and now you always grab a handful when you pass by,then you have replaced something good with something addictive. Don’t do that.EATING FOR PLEASURE AND REWARDProcessed foods are designed to make us want to eat more. They are marketed inways that are designed to make us eat more. That is the job of the people whosell the stuff, and it is the job of the people who make the stuff. And they dotheir job very well.There were many good-tasting foods available to our ancestors. Look at fruitsand berries for a moment. They have sugar and delicious flavors that evolved toentice birds and mammals to help the plant sow its seeds. But evolution isfrugal. There is enough sugar and flavor to get us to eat the fruit, and nomore. If the plant put more energy into the fruit than was required, the moreparsimonious plants would have energy left over to grow taller and producedeeper roots. They would succeed, and would outcompete the more generous plants.Once we learned how to breed plants, we changed that equation. We protected theplants that produced larger, sweeter fruit. We selected them and didn’t planttheir less generous cousins. The ancestor of corn is a tiny plant calledteosinte. Its tiny fruiting body bears perhaps a dozen kernels. EarlyMesoamericans selected for larger kernels, and a few centuries later we had cornon the cob. Such selective breeding has given us big juicy grapes, apples,plums, cherries, melons, and giant pumpkins weighing over a ton.Image [images/56.jpg]Wikimedia Commons,https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Giant_Pumpkin_Festival.jpg[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Giant_Pumpkin_Festival.jpg]With very few exceptions, everything we eat has been modified to the benefit ofhumans, by humans. That includes everything on the so-called Paleo diet as well.Our early caveman ancestors did not have anything like the beef, pork, chicken,or eggs we buy in the grocery store, and nothing like the broccoli, cauliflower,squash, cabbage, lettuce, or tomatoes.We did not stop there, however. We developed wheat from a puny ancestral grassinto the profoundly productive crop we have today, with its huge stores offast-digesting starch. We found ways to distill the juice of the fibrous stalksof another grass, the sugar cane, into the pure white sucrose crystals we buy bythe 5-pound bag. We crush and press seeds and nuts to extract the pure oils.Sometimes we extract the oils with solvents to get the last tiny drops.We have a huge industry to produce salt from brines and mines. In fact, salt wasonce so precious that it was used as currency for Roman soldiers, giving us theword “salary” and the expression “worth his salt.”Think of all this energy we’ve devoted to the production of food. But now wehave more food than we can eat. Starvation still abounds, but it is not becausethere is not enough food. It is because we demand payment for the food, and noteveryone can pay. Hunger is a problem of poverty, not of agriculturalproduction.The people who make the processed foods in the grocery store carry on this longtradition of invention. But now their efforts are not aimed at producing morefood. There is plenty of food, and it is not very expensive. Potatoes are 28cents a pound as I write this. So is sugar. The corn we feed to cattle is 45cents a pound. But if we grind that corn into flour and add some sugar, we getKellogg’s Corn Pops at $4.33 per pound. People don’t crave corn. Even people whocrave sugar don’t eat a lot of it straight out of the bag. But people willconsume Corn Pops all day long if you keep a full bowl in front of them. Theyeat Corn Pops like the candy they are. They are pretty. They have a surprisingamount of salt in them, hidden by the sugar. They have added soybean oil in justthe right amount to add richness. They are light and fluffy, but crunchy. Theyare incredibly sweet. And they don’t satisfy hunger. In fact, they make youhungrier. By design.When you take something that costs 50 cents a pound and sell it for eight timesthat much, you want to sell as much as you can. You do that by learning whatpeople can’t stop eating.Why can’t we stop eating? There is the sugar, of course, which is damaging oursatiety sensors. But there is something else.Much of what we have been discussing so far has been about our body’s naturalcontrols over how much we eat—the various signaling molecules that make ushungry or tell us we have had enough. But we have found out how to make peopleeat when they aren’t hungry. We have found out how to make them eat even whenthey are so full it hurts. After that Thanksgiving meal, when the mere sight ofmore mashed potatoes makes you feel a little queasy, out comes the pie à lamode, and everyone digs in.There are two parts of the brain involved here. The homeostasis part of thebrain is telling us we don’t need to eat. But the reward side of the brain isanticipating that dopamine rush that happens when we eat the right combinationof sugar, salt, and fat. Our processed food manufacturers have learned thiscombination, and more. They talk about mouthfeel. Crunch. They engineer the foodto quickly dissolve on the tongue to get the sugar to the brain as quickly aspossible. They study aromas that enter through the nose, but also aromas thatenter the nose from the back of the mouth, where we breathe.There was a time when it was legal to add cocaine to soft drinks. That is, ofcourse, how Coca-Cola got its name. It was a drug delivery system. But now thatcompany has teams of scientists studying how to make people buy and drink moresugar water. Add a bit of salt (15 milligrams per can), hidden by 38 grams ofsugar per can, and people will drink more, since it no longer quenches thirst.But they don’t sell only cola. Grape soda has 56 milligrams of salt. Root beerhas 48. Orange soda has 45. To hide that salt, these drinks have even moresugar, with cream soda coming in at over 49 grams of sugar per can (12⅓teaspoons).When drinking doesn’t satisfy thirst, and all the calories in the drink comefrom sugar, which doesn’t let you know when to stop, it is easy to sell128-ounce Team Gulp—a full gallon of sugar water. The average stomach can holdonly 30 ounces, so you’ll be gulping those 1,489 calories of sugar for a while.But even one stomachful of soda has 350 calories. Ten of those make a pound offat. If you do it once a day, in a year you will have gained 36 pounds.When most of the processed foods that are so prevalent contain so much sugar,our tongues and brains adjust, and it takes more sugar to make something tastesweet. So things keep getting sweeter. But sugar is put into foods for more thanjust the sweet. It thickens pastes to make them extrude from chip and candyprocessing machines. It adds the crunch to those Corn Pops. It binds theingredients in crunchy granola together. It hides the taste of salt, as we sawwith soda, but also with many snack foods that actually taste salty. Without thesugar, they would taste inedibly salty. Sugar masks the sour of lemons inlemonade. It hides the bitter taste of caffeine, the drug added to soda to makeit more addictive than plain old cocaine.Adding salt to the soda doesn’t just prevent it from quenching thirst. Ourtongues have sensors for salt, and our brain’s reward system kicks in when weget that formerly rare commodity, just like it does with sugar. Having tworewarding tastes in the same package makes that product much more desirable thanif there were only one or the other. Add some fat to your sugar and salt and youget caramel corn, which is also crunchy and delivers the calories extremelyfast, furthering the reward.A chocolate chip cookie is a delivery vehicle for sugar, salt, and fat. Youmight think you like chocolate, but plain cocoa powder is no one’s favoritefood. It has the flavor but without the sugar, salt, and fat. Add some fat andyou get baking chocolate. Better, but still basically inedible. Add 10 percentsugar, and people will eat it. Add 20 percent sugar, and people will pay moneyfor it. Add the right amount of sugar, salt, and fat and you get a candy bar,which is engineered to make you want to eat pounds of them when you aren’t evenhungry.If there is a food that you will eat even when you are not hungry, you probablydon’t want to have that food close at hand when you are trying to lose weight.Throw away the cookies, ice cream, chips, sodas, etc. Just throw them away. Noone else needs them either.Sometimes it is a food you might have considered not to be a problem, or you mayeven have considered to be healthy. That wonderful sourdough bread. Toast andjam. (OK, you did know the jam was mostly sugar.) Chocolate milk. Energy bars.If you are eating it when you aren’t hungry, get rid of it. It is not on yourside in the weight-loss battle.Whenever you find that you are searching for something to eat, stop and think.The mere fact that you are still searching tells you that you are not hungry.You are looking for pleasure from food, instead of from any of the hundreds ofother things you could be doing that give you pleasure. You passed by plenty ofgood food in your quest, and any of it would have fixed a hunger problem. Youdon’t have a hunger problem. You may have an addiction.ADDICTIVE EATINGThe earlier you expose children to sweet tastes, the more they will crave themlater in life. Infant formula, which is more than 10 percent sugar, predisposeschildren to become obese adults. The more sugar a pregnant woman eats, the moreit crosses through the placenta to the unborn child. This developmental, orfetal, programming affects how the child reacts to food after birth and intoadulthood.The deliciously engineered processed foods hit all the reward notes in thebrain. We eat them and overeat them. Eventually, we become accustomed to thehigh levels of sugar, salt, and fat, and we need more to get the same reward.This is addiction.Suggest that someone give up anything that has sugar in it. Even for a day. Mostof us are addicted to sugar, and the thought of giving up sugar in our morningcoffee makes us anxious. Give up all desserts? No ice cream? No chocolate?People have told me life would not be worth living. But for millions of years,it clearly was. We have only recently invented these addictive foods.There are three signs of addiction: craving, bingeing, and withdrawal. If youcrave potato chips or cookies or ice cream, that is a sign. If you have evereaten a whole package of some food that claims to contain 4 or 5 servings, thatis a sign. If you can’t stop thinking about your favorite food when it isn’tavailable for some reason, that is a sign. You are an addict.Addicts will consume their chosen object of desire whether or not they need thecalories it contains. They will get fat. They will continue to get fatter overtime. Feeding an addiction just makes it worse. If you are an addict, you needto stop.Some of us can quit cold turkey. We are lucky enough to be born with genes thatmake us a little less prone to addictive behavior. For most people, quitting ishard. They try to taper off, and some succeed. Others need more help—a supportgroup, a retreat, or some other assistance. But it can be done. You can becomefree of your addiction to french fries or cookies or milk shakes.It would probably be difficult for a recovering alcoholic to be a bartender. Tocontrol his addiction, he might want to stay away from alcohol. The same logicapplies to a food addict. Don’t bring your addictive foods home. Don’t have themaround the house. If you think you are depriving the rest of your family, youare letting your addiction fool you. They don’t need it either, and you don’twant them to become addicted. If they have to go out to get their treats, theywill be less likely to become addicted. They will still love you, I promise.If you always associate an addictive substance with a place, an object, or aperson, then when you see the other thing, you want the addictive substance. Thecoupling is often two addictive things: alcohol and cigarettes, cigarettes andcoffee, coffee and a doughnut. Other times it is just a situation: a movie andcandy from the concession counter, television and a bag of chips. These arecalled reinforcers. Cigarette manufacturers learned long ago that constantreminders everywhere sell more cigarettes—billboards, magazines, television ads.There is always more advertising for addictive things than for any other type ofproduct, because reminding you about your addiction makes you buy more of it.Soft drink ads are everywhere, not to get you to switch from Coke to Pepsi (thatdoesn’t happen), but to make you think about the addictive substance.Just reading this book is going to make you think about food. You might read allabout why some foods are better than others, and which ones to stay away from,but your mind will dwell on your particular addictive food. If you find you haveassociated something with food, consider changing your habits. If you always eatsomething while watching television, replace the food with a glass of water youcan sip to keep your hands and mouth busy with something nonaddictive. If youalways pass that pizza restaurant on the way home, try taking a different route.Cancel your subscription to Gourmet magazine.Addictive eating may be one of the main reasons why the obesity epidemic hasaffected the high end of the BMI range even more than the rest. We defineobesity as a BMI over 30, and morbid obesity as a BMI over 40. Obesity hasdoubled since 1980, but morbid obesity has quadrupled in that time. As foodmanufacturers have learned more about how to make foods especially palatable,they have not only caused people to become addicted, but they have made itespecially hard for those people who are genetically more likely to get pleasurefrom addictive foods (Davis et al. 2009).There are two mechanisms that can make people prone to addiction. Some peoplecan have a greater tendency than others to feel reward, or they can have a lowertendency. In the first case, they become addicted because they get greatfeelings from pleasurable things. In the second case, they compensate for thelack of reward by consuming larger quantities of pleasurable things. As we haveseen in many other places in this book, there are different subtypes of obesity,and thus there will need to be different approaches to solving the problem.METABOLIC RATEHow fast we burn calories is obviously an important aspect of any weight-lossprogram.Metabolic rate is often measured as either the total energy expenditure or theresting energy expenditure. In a study of three diets (low fat, low glycemicindex, and very low carbohydrate), the low-fat diet caused a decrease in restingenergy expenditure of 205 calories per day. The low glycemic load diet caused adecrease of 166 calories per day, and the very low-carbohydrate diet caused adecrease of 138 calories per day (Ebbeling et al. 2012).Total energy expenditure was similar—423 fewer calories burned on the low-fatdiet, 297 fewer on the low glycemic index diet, and 97 fewer on the verylow-carbohydrate diet.This explains why the low-fat diet is less effective at maintaining weight lossthan the very low-carbohydrate diet. We just stop burning as many calories. Fourhundred twenty-three calories less per day is a lot. To make up for this, ofcourse, we have to eat 423 fewer calories, when our body is complaining that itis already starving. (The study involved people who had just lost 10 to 15percent of their body weight.) It is no surprise that the low-fat diets are notsustainable.If we have just lost 15 percent of our body weight on a very low-carbohydratediet, how can we stimulate our resting energy expenditure to make up for those97 fewer calories per day?Some things you can do to raise metabolic rate: * Eat enough. Once you have lost the weight, stop dieting. * Expose yourself to cold. Exercising in 60°F weather increases brown fat heat generation. Sleeping in a 66°F room also raises metabolic rate. * Eat medium-chain triglycerides. Replacing some of the fat with MCT oil improves metabolism. * Build more muscle mass. The muscle cells all need to burn calories just to survive. * Eat hot peppers (capsaicin) or rub on some capsaicin pain-relieving cream. * Drink green tea or take green tea concentrate pills. Ninety milligrams of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) can boost metabolism by 80 calories per day (Dulloo et al. 1999). Don’t consume more than 400 mg per day. * Drink or eat yerba mate (Y. Kang et al. 2012). * Do interval training—walking plus 60-second sprints. * Get 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. * Increase fiber intake. * Stand instead of sitting. Good for 50 calories per day. * Eat omega-3 fats. Reducing inflammation helps the thyroid. * Get enough sleep, but at night, not during the day. * Drink more water. * Drink caffeine (but not too much). * Reduce stress.EXERCISEExercise alone does little to reduce BMI. But a low-calorie diet withoutexercise does not reduce fat as well as a low-calorie diet with exercise. Justas people have different weight-management problems, people react differently toexercise. People vary. Some lose more weight from exercise than others. But eventhose who lose only a couple pounds due to the increased exercise benefit fromimproved aerobic capacity, improved blood pressure, reduced waist size, andimproved mood (King et al. 2012).For two-thirds of the population, exercise does not make them hungry and doesnot cause them to eat more, even though it burns more calories than theyotherwise would have burned (King et al. 2012). This was found to be true inoverweight and obese subjects but not lean subjects, who did eat more in orderto protect their already low stores of fat.Exercise makes your muscles more sensitive to insulin. When the pancreas makesinsulin to lower blood sugar, the muscles listen to the signal and burn moreglucose. This leaves less glucose to be stored as fat.Exercise reduces stress. Less cortisol is released into the blood. Cortisolmakes you hungry. Exercise reduces appetite, because there is less cortisol inthe blood. But it also improves your sensitivity to your body’s appetite controlmechanisms (Long, Hart, and Morgan 2002). Sedentary people lose the ability totell when they have already eaten enough (Walleghen et al. 2007). Exerciserestores that ability, so we don’t overeat. The hunger hormone ghrelin needs tobe activated by attaching a medium-chain fatty acid to it. If the muscles haveused up all the free fatty acid, the ghrelin is not active, and you aren’thungry. There is also an increase in the hunger-reducing hormones peptide YY,glucagon-like polypeptide-1, and pancreatic polypeptide (King et al. 2012).Exercise speeds up carbohydrate metabolism, so there is less carbohydrate in theliver to be converted into fat.Some types of exercise build muscle. Muscle is your friend when you are dieting.Muscle tissue needs to burn calories just to survive. The more muscle you have,the more calories you burn, even while you sit at the computer or watchtelevision, or even while you are sleeping. Creating new muscle is work, so beprepared to do some work. Feel good about it. Having a workout partner helps alot on those days when you feel like just skipping all that work. Make it asocial occasion.Some forms of exercise are not as much work, but they help in other ways. Take a20-minute walk. That will still reduce stress, reduce appetite, burn up liverglycogen stores, and make your muscles more sensitive to insulin. While you arewalking, you aren’t eating. You don’t need to make it a workout that you dread.A nice walk in the park, a conversation with a walking partner, some sightseeingin a new area—all these things will make the exercise fun and hopefullysomething you look forward to.You can make any errand into fun exercise. A trip to the mall can include acouple extra laps around it. (Stay away from the Cinnabon!) Park farther away.The parking is easier to find there anyway. Maybe you can bike somewhere insteadof drive.Exercise has been found to affect how people think about food. After exercise,people find it easier to restrain their appetite and retain their inhibition toeating high-energy foods (King et al. 2012). They find it easier to overcomeopportunistic eating and have more control over their eating.While the increase in lean muscle mass is the most pronounced effect of exerciseon metabolic rate, there is a hormone called irisin that is stimulated byexercise, and this hormone affects fat burning (thermogenesis) in brown fat,beige fat, and to some extent white fat. It is through this mechanism that micecan be protected from age-induced obesity.TELEVISION VIEWINGFor many people, the time for watching television or using computer screens isafter dark. The white pixels on the screen are made up of individual red, green,and blue pixels. Getting blue light is the signal that resets our inner clocks.We evolved in an environment where blue light meant it was daytime. There isvery little blue in the light of a campfire.When our circadian clocks are disrupted, we don’t sleep well. We stay up late.In the morning, we wake either to an alarm clock or to sunlight coming through awindow, complete with the light from a blue sky. We end up sleep deprived.Sleep deprivation leads to obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, hypertension,and all the other problems we lump into the category of metabolic syndrome.So, while we generally sit passively in front of screens, and therefore are notgetting any exercise, lack of exercise is only one component of thescreen-induced obesity problem. Much of the advertising on television is aboutfood. Just thinking about food causes insulin levels to rise in anticipation ofa meal. This insulin tells fat cells to lower blood sugar by storing the energyas fat. The lower blood sugar makes us hungry.PERSONALITYThe Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (see page 193[013_Chapter10.xhtml#page_193]) rates people according to three criteria, calledDisinhibition, Hunger, and Restraint.People ranking high in Disinhibition and Hunger and low on Restraint find itmore difficult to lose weight than people with the opposite tendencies (King etal. 2012). When they exercise, they tend to compensate by eating more. Thosewith the opposite tendencies compensate for exercise by eating less, which helpsthem lose more weight than others. It’s as if they don’t want to waste all thateffort, or the exercise reminds them of their determination to lose weight.Exercise actually helped people change their scores on the questionnaire,becoming better at restraint and eating inhibition and less hungry (King et al.2012). This effect depended on whether they lost weight due to the exercise ornot, with most improvement happening when most progress was seen.An interesting personality effect is that overweight and obese people tend tounderestimate how much they are eating (Vliet-Ostaptchouk et al. 2008). Not onlydoes this confound studies that ask people to remember how much they ate, but itmay actually contribute to obesity, since you might eat more if you think youare eating less.In a large study of 1,988 people that spanned 50 years, several personalitytraits were tracked against measures of adiposity (fatness) (Sutin et al. 2011).They tested for neuroticism, extroversion, conscientiousness, impulsivity, andagreeableness. People higher in neuroticism or extroversion were more likely tohave higher BMIs. People low on conscientiousness also had higher BMIs. Theseassociations carried over for body fat and waist and hip circumference. Thehighest association with BMI and body fat was with the impulsiveness scores.People scoring in the top 10 percent in impulsivity weighed on average 24 poundsmore than those in the lowest 10 percent.Those with high scores on neuroticism and low scores on conscientiousness hadthe most weight fluctuation over the 50-year span, indicating difficulty withimpulse control. Low scores on agreeableness were related to increases in BMIover time.Self-discipline is usually required to stick to an exercise regimen or to adiet, or even to a meal schedule. This is a reflection of the conscientiousnesspersonality trait tracked in the 50-year study. These people are more physicallyactive, refrain from binge eating and drinking, and are less likely to havedisordered eating habits.Neuroticism is associated both with underweight and overweight subjects. Eatingdisorders associated with neuroticism include both overeating andundereating—bingeing, bulimia, and anorexia nervosa. There are two aspects ofneuroticism that affect obesity: impulsiveness and vulnerability. The first isassociated with high BMI, and the second with lower BMI (Sutin et al. 2011).The associations with extroversion and agreeableness are less evident, andsubject to cultural differences and gender, and different studies come up withopposite results, depending on the cohorts studied. The subjects who scored highon the activity aspect of extroversion tended to weigh less, while those whoscored higher on the positive emotionality aspects weighed more.Personality does not just affect the choices of when and what to eat. Neuroticand antagonistic people have greater physiological reactivity to stress and havehigher cortisol levels, both of which are associated with higher BMI. They showhigher levels of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6, even long afterthe stressor has been removed (Sutin et al. 2011). Hostile individuals continueto eat even after they are satiated. This behavior adds up to weight gain overtime.Personality effects also occur in the reverse direction. Weight loss usuallyresults in improved mood and quality of life and lowers the incidence ofdepression.Last, personality traits do not guarantee that you will be overweight. Theymerely indicate a tendency. Personality traits lead to obesity only if theyaffect behavior, which is something we can control. While personality traits arefairly stable in any one individual, the expression of those traits can bechanged and controlled. Knowing your personality allows you to take specificactions, such as hiding the ice cream when you are feeling stressed, or makinggrocery shopping a regular habit so that you don’t eat at fast food restaurantsnight after night.EATING HABITSWe have already discussed addictive eating, automatic eating, and eating forpleasure when we aren’t hungry. But there are other eating habits that cancontribute to obesity.Before the obesity epidemic got going full force, we tended to eat differentlythan we do today. We ate three meals a day, and the meals were longer affairs.We didn’t snack between meals. Our mothers told us that would “spoil yourdinner” (i.e., we would not be hungry, and we wouldn’t eat the food she hadworked hard to prepare). Dinner was a time to eat slowly and discuss whathappened during the day. Eating slowly gives your body time to generate thesatiety signals that tell you when to stop eating.These days, we wolf down a meal in 15 minutes or less. Eating too quickly allowsus to overeat and regret it later when those signals catch up to us. We takepills to fix the heartburn caused by overeating.We also eat much more between meals. The snack food industry is huge and spendsenormous amounts of advertising money to convince us we need to eat at the firstsign of hunger, or even to eat just in case we might otherwise become hungry. Aswe will see in the section on insulin, we need a period of a few hours betweenmeals for the insulin levels to drop, or else we become insensitive to insulinand become obese and diabetic.We have also lost all sense of portion control. Advertisements for restaurantsstress the huge sizes of their burgers, burritos, or foot-long sandwiches. Weget a full day’s worth of calories on a single plate, and the restaurantscompete in a race to put more calories on the plate. Because the calories arelargely sugar and refined wheat flour, we can eat those huge portions withoutgetting the satiety signals we need to know when to stop.Many people reach for a sugary soft drink instead of water when they arethirsty. We don’t need the calories—we are thirsty, not hungry. The sugar thenmakes us hungry, and the salt in the soft drinks makes us thirsty again. Themakers of these drinks know exactly how to sell more sugared soda water.The snacks we reach for tend to be low in fiber and low in moisture. An apple issatisfying because of its fiber and water content. It slows down the emptying ofthe stomach, and that makes the satiety last longer. A cookie has almost nofiber or moisture. Both fiber and moisture make processed foods hard to storeand ship. And the snack food makers don’t want to make you satisfied, becausethen you’d stop eating.INFECTIONBeing obese raises your risk of infection by interfering with your immunesystem. The body’s reaction to infection is to cause inflammation, which isknown to increase obesity. Obesity itself lowers immune response, but theimbalanced nutrition that led to the obese condition is also a factor, sincegood nutrition is important to almost every system in the body, including theimmune system. Obesity is even a risk factor in influenza, increasing theprobability of hospitalization and death (Morgan et al. 2010).It is thus no surprise that obesity correlates with many infections. But what ifthe cause and effect also go in the opposite direction? What if there was avirus that could cause obesity?Human adenovirus 36 is a virus associated with obesity in humans (Ponterio andGnessi 2015). There are other adenoviruses that may also contribute to obesity.In animals, there are several known viruses that contribute to obesity. Dogshave canine distemper virus, which causes brain damage that then causes obesity.We have seen how much of appetite control and energy balance is tightlycontrolled in the brain, and throwing a rock into that intricate circuitry isbound to cause trouble. Other infectious agents that cause obesity in animalsare rous-associated virus (chickens) and borna disease virus (rats andchickens). These also cause brain damage, leading to obesity.Adenoviruses are the only infective agents known to cause obesity in humans (aswell as in animals). There are more than 50 types of adenovirus that can infecthumans. The human adenoviruses Adv5 and Adv37 cause obesity in animals. Thehuman adenoviruses Adv2 and Adv36 cause obesity in humans, but not in animals.Of these two, Adv36 has been more widely studied. Adv36 causes a 15 to 30percent increase in body weight in monkeys.In studies using rats, even killed virus cultures caused an increase of 25percent in visceral fat mass (Ponterio and Gnessi 2015). Something in the virusaffects preadipocytes, cells that go on to form fat cells. Those cells arestimulated to differentiate and proliferate, becoming fat cells. The virus alsocauses the concentration of lipids (fats) in the fat cells. The virus alsoreduces the burning of fatty acids and increases the creation of new fat, evenin muscle cells.A hallmark of this form of obesity is low blood cholesterol and low bloodtriglycerides, both of which are more commonly raised in other forms of obesity.The fat is also more subcutaneous fat than visceral (central) fat. Adv36 alsoimproves glucose uptake, giving infected people and animals better control ofglucose levels and better insulin sensitivity. These positive aspects of theinfection—low blood lipids and cholesterol, improved glucose management,improved insulin sensitivity, reduced risk of nonalcoholic fatty liverdisease—have led researchers to look into certain viral proteins as tools andpossible treatments for diabetes and other aspects of metabolic syndrome.Insulin levels in infected animals are reduced, but whether that is caused bybetter insulin sensitivity or some other reason is not yet clear.On the other hand, Adv36 most likely causes obesity by causing chronicinflammation. One of the inflammatory cytokines produced in response to Adv36infection is MCP-1, which causes immune cells called macrophages to infiltratefat cells, altering fat metabolism, leading to obesity, insulin resistance, andfatty liver disease, although those last two may be ameliorated by certainproteins in Adv36.Image [images/70.jpg]Inflammatory cytokine MCP-1 protein structureIn studies in the United States it was found that 30 percent of obese and 11percent of nonobese adults have been infected with Adv36. It is very easilytransmitted (Ponterio and Gnessi 2015), and there is a strong correlation withobesity. In US children, 28 percent of obese and 18 percent of nonobese havebeen infected. In Italy, the incidence of infection is 65 percent, while inBelgium and the Netherlands, the rate is only 5 percent.Adv36 infection reduces leptin levels and norepinephrine levels. This makes theinfected animals hungry, and they eat more. Since leptin is alsoanti-inflammatory, the lack of it further increases inflammation and thusobesity.A killed-virus (via ultraviolet light) vaccine against Adv36 has been tested inrats (Pasarica, Loiler, and Dhurandhar 2008). Unvaccinated rats gainedsubstantial weight after infection, while vaccinated rats were protected. Thereis no human vaccine at this time.AGEWe tend to gain weight as we age. This can be the result of a continued smallpositive energy balance, as we get just a few more calories per day than weburn, but other factors are also at work, as there are many differentinteracting systems that keep our body weight stable, and over time, these canbegin to fail. For example, as we age, the brown and beige fat in our bodiesthat burn energy to keep us warm begin to fail. Resting metabolic rate declineswith age, as does the thermic effect of food (food raising body heat), andphysical activity declines. Without these ways to get rid of excess energy, westore it as fat. Resting metabolic rate declines by 2 to 3 percent per decadeafter age 20 (Villareal et al. 2005). Most of this is due to the loss of muscle,which burns energy just to stay alive, in addition to what it burns to do work.Average body weight and BMI gradually increase with age, reaching a peak at age50 to 59 in both men and women (Villareal et al. 2005). After age 60, bodyweight on average declines, but this may be due to the fact that obese peopledon’t live as long, so they aren’t counted in the average as age goes up. TheFramingham Heart Study saw a 6- to 7-year drop in lifespan for people with a BMIover 30, compared to nonobese counterparts. The NHANES Mortality Study foundthat for adults in their 20s, men with a BMI over 45 could expect to lose 13years of life, and women 8.In addition to mortality taking its toll on these averages, the fat-free mass(bone and muscle) declines with age (up to 40 percent between ages 20 and 70),while fat mass increases continually with age. So the body weight might peak at60, but the fat never peaks. Again, this is averaged over large numbers ofsubjects. It does not mean that you personally will continue to get fatter. Itjust means that the same thing that is causing the obesity epidemic continues towork all our lives. For most of us, we can make diet and lifestyle changes thateliminate the risk. Exercise designed to increase lean body mass (muscle) cancounter this trend of losing muscle mass as we age.As we age, the distribution of body fat also tends to change. Men tend to storemore of their fat abdominally instead of under the skin, and this trendincreases with age. Postmenopausal women take on male patterns of fatdistribution, thus also tending toward dangerous visceral fat instead of themuch less risky subcutaneous (under the skin) fat.Two factors associated with aging, blood pressure and dementia, have been linkedto insulin resistance. Curing insulin resistance can thus prevent both the highblood pressure and the cognitive decline usually associated with aging. Insulinresistance also causes fat to be stored in the muscles and liver, where it cancause serious medical concerns.Hyperleptinemia (too much leptin in the blood, caused by leptin resistance) iscommon in older populations (Pérez et al. 2004). This can be fixed by dieting(caloric restriction), resulting in improved leptin sensitivity, as well asimproved insulin sensitivity. Since these effects also occur in obesity, andhave the same cure, we can think of obesity as a kind of premature aging.On the other hand, too little leptin is also common as we age. Leptin isproduced by fat cells and is a signal to the brain of how much fat we possess,so the brain can adjust hunger to the need for energy storage. As we age,however, the amount of leptin in the blood no longer keeps pace with the amountof fat we are storing (Moller, O’Brien, and Nair 1998). With these two effects,leptin resistance and lower leptin levels, we eat more. The fix for this isfasting, which increases leptin sensitivity and insulin sensitivity.Aging also changes hormone levels. Human growth hormone (HGH) declines, as doestestosterone.Image [images/73.jpg]TestosteroneWe become less sensitive to thyroid hormone, hence the decline in metabolicrate. The decrease in leptin may be due to decreases in testosterone or growthhormone (Moller, O’Brien, and Nair 1998).The age-related decline in insulin sensitivity is associated with inactivity andabdominal obesity. Physically active lean senior citizens are much less prone totype 2 diabetes as they age than those who are inactive and obese (Villareal etal. 2005)."},{"pageContent":"5Image [images/conical.jpg]HORMONESThere are numerous hormones and other molecules that affect energy homeostasis.This is to be expected, since anything as important as energy management willhave evolved a large set of regulatory mechanisms. Some of the more importantenergy-regulating molecules are discussed here.As we look at the various hormones that control metabolism, hunger, and energy,we want to remember that for every hormone there may be more than one form, andoften more than one receptor, and that the hormone and the receptors are allcoded for by genes. These genes can differ between individuals, so that in somepeople the hormones work better than in others, in ways that affect thelikelihood of obesity.Genes for hormones and their receptors are also affected by epigenetic changesto the genes, which can turn them on or off or affect how often they areexpressed. Environmental changes can affect these, and they can sometimes bepassed on to children.Environmental differences can also affect how and when hormones are produced,and how well the receptors for them work. Receptors for heat and cold willaffect hormones that control thermogenesis. Receptors for glucose will controlhormones that affect the pancreas, causing it to produce more hormones, orsometimes fewer. Exercise causes the production of hormones that affect otherbody systems and usually result in yet more hormone signals to be sent.Hormones are often antagonistic to one another, with one stimulating an effectand the other inhibiting it. There may be more than one of these co-controllingpairs, acting as backup systems and fine-tuning controls. The more important acontrol system is, the more likely it is that there will be several layers ofcontrol, so that if any part isn’t functioning properly, other parts can rescuethe organism to some extent.This redundancy protects us from serious harm, but it also allows individualswith loss-of-function mutations in a gene to still reproduce and pass thatdamaged gene on to future generations.Knowing more about your own hormone-control systems and genetics can inform dietand lifestyle choices. If you have dopamine and opioid receptors that are moresensitive than others, you may be more prone to eating addictive, rewardingfoods. If your diet doesn’t contain enough fiber, your gut bacteria may not beproducing satiety hormones that tell you to stop eating. If you eat a lot ofsweets or easily digested starches, you may be overproducing insulin, leading toa host of metabolic problems. Stress will produce hormones that have evolved tohelp you deal with the stressor but can cause problems if the stressor isconstant. Even your gender will cause hormone differences that affect how yourbody stores and uses fat.INSULINImage [images/76.jpg]Many books on weight control concentrate on insulin, as if insulin alone is thecause of obesity. Books that claim that sugar or carbohydrates are the problemfocus on the hormone insulin as the reason that these foods make us fat. Whilethe truth is actually more varied and complex, insulin is indeed an importantelement in many of the problems, which are all connected in the web of how ourmetabolism works.Insulin is produced in the pancreas in little clumps of cells called the isletsof Langerhans, named after a medical student (Paul Langerhans) who firstdiscovered them in 1869. Before the hormone was ever isolated, it was shown thatthere was an unknown substance that controlled how much glucose was produced bythe liver, and that this unidentified substance came from the islet cells. Thename given to the hormone reflects this. Insulin is the islet hormone.Insulin and obesity are closely connected. Obesity is a major risk factor fortype 2 diabetes through the mechanism of insulin resistance. Fat cells affectinsulin sensitivity and insulin levels, and insulin strongly affects fat cells.In nonobese people, fat cells and insulin are in balance. But once we start toovereat, for whatever reason, we fill up the fat cells, and they no longer workproperly. This affects insulin levels, and we get a whole range of problems,such as high blood pressure, hardening of the arteries, excess fat andcholesterol in the blood, and other conditions associated with obesity, such aspolycystic ovarian disease.Insulin acts on the ovary, causing it to produce testosterone. When a woman’sliver, muscles, and fat cells become insulin resistant, the pancreas producesmore insulin to compensate. This causes the ovaries to produce moretestosterone, causing problems with ovulation and causing cysts to form in theovaries. Testosterone also causes the growth of facial hair and the thinning ofthe hair on the scalp, effects normally found in men—beards, mustaches, and malepattern baldness. It also causes adult acne.Fat cells (adipocytes) are very sensitive to insulin. Insulin causes cellscalled preadipocytes to become new adipocytes; in other words, it causes new fatcells to form. In mature fat cells, insulin stimulates glucose transport fromthe blood into the fat cell. It also increases the conversion of that glucoseinto triglycerides (fat). At the same time, insulin tells the fat cell not tobreak down triglycerides to produce free fatty acids, and it prevents fattyacids from leaving the cell. Furthermore, insulin tells the fat cells to absorbfatty acids and lipoproteins (proteins that carry fat, such as HDL and LDL) fromthe blood, and to store the fatty acids as triglycerides (Kahn and Flier 2000).Muscle cells are strongly influenced by insulin, and they are the main tissue inwhich insulin stimulates glucose disposal by burning the glucose, making andstoring glycogen, and by making and storing triglycerides in lipid dropletsinside the cell.Insulin tells the liver to stop producing glucose from its glycogen stores, andto produce fats and store them. It tells the muscle cells and the fat cells toincrease their use of glucose from the blood.Insulin is anti-inflammatory (Dandona, Aljada, and Bandyopadhyay 2004) andreduces harmful reactive oxidation species, but we lose this effect when webecome resistant to insulin. Insulin resistance causes inflammation, whichcauses obesity, diabetes, and atherosclerosis.INSULIN INSENSITIVITYInsulin resistance has two characteristics: high levels of insulin in the bloodcoupled with high levels of glucose (blood sugar) in the blood. Since insulin issupposed to lower blood sugar, this state can be achieved only if cells areignoring the insulin signal. The long-term effects are that cells run out offuel, there are elevated levels of fats in the blood, and there is high bloodpressure.Insulin resistance predicts many diseases, such as heart attacks, stroke,ovarian cysts, macular degeneration, Alzheimer’s disease, and cancer, inaddition to diabetes and obesity (Monte and Wands 2008).When we become resistant to insulin, the cells in our muscles, liver, and fatchange how they respond to insulin.Insulin resistance affects different cells in different ways. In some cases, iteven affects the same cell in different ways. For example, fat cells(adipocytes) react to insulin by several mechanisms, and some are more sensitiveto insulin than others are. Only low levels of insulin are needed to make fatcells stop breaking down fat. But higher levels are needed to stimulate glucosetransport into the cell. Thus, even when fat cells become resistant to insulin’scalls to increase glucose uptake, they maintain their fat reserves by heedinginsulin’s instruction to hold on to the fat (Kahn and Flier 2000).Muscles become resistant to insulin when they get too much free fatty acidbuilding up. This happens, for example, when alcohol is consumed. Alcohol isdetoxified in the liver, where it is converted (by a complex process) into freefatty acids and very low density lipoproteins (VLDL, the worst type ofcholesterol). This same thing happens when we eat fructose (or table sugar,sucrose, which is 50 percent fructose). The fructose is converted into fat, freefatty acids, and VLDL by the liver. The free fatty acids in the muscles thencause the muscles to be less sensitive to insulin. When insulin tells them toburn glucose, they ignore the signal. The glucose then ends up being storedinstead of burned. The other source of free fatty acids in the muscles is excessbody fat. This causes inflammation, and the fat cells release free fatty acidsinto the blood.In the liver, metabolizing fructose also creates the inflammatory molecule JNK1.This interferes with the liver’s receptors for insulin. The liver becomesinsulin resistant. It no longer stops producing blood sugar from its storedglycogen. Blood sugar rises, prompting a rise in insulin. The insulin tells themuscles to burn glucose, but they are also insulin resistant. The high levels ofinsulin cause the fat cells to store more fat and to stop breaking down storedfat for energy.Alzheimer’s disease is an insulin-resistance disease (Tong et al. 2009). Longbefore the characteristic amyloid deposits form in the Alzheimer’s-diseasedbrain, the cognitive impairment caused by insulin resistance is evident. Insulinresistance in the brain, leading to cognitive impairment (Blázquez et al. 2014)and Alzheimer’s disease, is now often called type 3 diabetes (Monte and Wands2008). That knowledge alone is often enough to make people give up sugar andwheat flour, as Alzheimer’s disease is a death many people fear more thancancer.Sugar is not the only thing that can cause insulin resistance. When processedmeats such as bacon and hot dogs are treated with nitrites, compounds callednitrosamines are produced. Nitrosamines are also present in beer, nonfat drymilk, tobacco, and cheeses made with nitrite pickling salt. Long associated withcancer (Larsson, Bergkvist, and Wolk 2006), nitrosamines also cause insulinresistance (Tong et al. 2009). One of the drugs (streptozotocin) thatresearchers use to create diabetes in laboratory mice is a nitrosamine.Nitrosamine exposure exacerbates other insulin-resistance diseases, such as type2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, and dementia (Monte et al. 2009).Cigarette smoking, aging, and sleep problems, especially sleep apnea and nightshift work, can also cause insulin resistance.Exercise increases muscle sensitivity to insulin. Thus, to some extent, lack ofexercise contributes to insulin resistance. This is separate from the number ofcalories expended during exercise, which is seldom anything but a smallpercentage of total daily calories expended.An interesting side effect of insulin resistance is skin tags. These are smallgrowths of skin, often in areas where the skin rubs against other skin orclothing. They are a warning sign for diabetes. People who have skin tags havehigher levels of fat in the blood, higher blood sugar, higher cholesterol, andhigher levels of C-reactive protein, a marker for inflammation. Insulin promotestissue growth, and when muscle, fat, and liver cells become resistant toinsulin, the pancreas produces more of it. This excess insulin has growtheffects in tissues such as the skin (Tamega et al. 2010).GLUCAGONLike insulin, glucagon is a hormone that was named before it was actuallydiscovered. In crude pancreatic extracts of insulin, blood sugar levels could beseen to rise before the insulin took effect and caused them to fall. Thisimpurity in the insulin extracts seemed to act as a glucose agonist. (An agonistis something that causes an effect; its opposite is an antagonist.) The name“glucagon” comes from the words “glucose” and “agonist.” In the 1950s, chemistsat Eli Lilly finally succeeded in isolating glucagon from other proteins inpancreatic extracts.Image [images/80.jpg]Glucagon is a hormone that, like insulin, is produced in the pancreas. Insulinis produced by beta cells, while glucagon is produced by alpha cells. Glucagonworks in the opposite way to insulin. It raises the concentration of glucose inthe blood. During fasting, when blood sugar is low, glucagon levels are highestand insulin levels are lowest. You can think of glucagon as the acceleratorpedal, and insulin as the brake, for glucose synthesis in the liver.When blood glucose levels fall, the pancreas sends out glucagon. The liver seesthe glucagon, starts making glucose from its glycogen stores, and releases theglucose into the blood. When glycogen stores are low, glucagon makes the liverswitch to producing glucose from breakdown products of proteins and fats.Glucagon is an appetite suppressant, acting in the brain’s hypothalamus, butalso reducing levels of the appetite-stimulating hormone ghrelin, which isproduced by the stomach. In obese people, however, it no longer suppressesappetite, and they remain hungry, in contrast to lean people (Arafat et al.2013). Thus, obesity causes not only insulin resistance but glucagon resistanceas well. Because glucagon still reduces ghrelin in obese people, theappetite-suppressing power of glucagon is not solely dependent on its effects onghrelin.There is a concept called the bihormonal hypothesis, which holds that type 2diabetes may be as much a problem caused by too much glucagon as by not enoughinsulin. The two hormones act as controls on one another, and it is not alwayspossible to say that a problem lies only with one side of the argument.Eating protein raises glucagon levels more than eating carbohydrate does,regardless of insulin levels. This is one reason protein curbs appetite morethan an equivalent number of calories of carbohydrate.Image [images/82-1.jpg]PreproglucagonGlucagon is produced by splitting up a larger protein, called preproglucagon,into smaller pieces. Many of these smaller pieces are hormones themselves, suchas GLP-1, GLP-2, MPGF, IP-1, IP-2, GRPP, glicentin, and oxyntomodulin. There areenzymes that cut the larger protein at specific points, and different tissuesuse different cutting enzymes to get the hormone they need from thepreproglucagon molecule. Note that many of these hormones overlap one another orinclude parts or all of other hormones. This can allow them to bind to receptorsfor those other hormones. Several of these hormones have effects on energybalance and will be discussed later (pages 112 [008_Chapter05.xhtml#page_112]and 114 [008_Chapter05.xhtml#page_114]).LEPTINThe Jackson Laboratory sits on Mount Desert Island in Maine, in the tiny town ofBar Harbor. Established in 1929, it is a biomedical research institution thatstudies the genetic components of health and disease. It is known for manyscientific breakthroughs, but also for the more than 7,000 strains ofgenetically defined mice that they raise for scientific studies all over theworld.Image [images/82-2.jpg]As a large breeding center for laboratory mice housed within a geneticslaboratory, the lab is a perfect place for finding new mutations in genes. Themice are examined for unique differences from their parents and other mice, andunusual variants are examined by genetics scientists.In 1947, there was a disastrous fire on the island that burned more than half ofthe island over a period of 10 days. The fire destroyed most of the laboratoryand most of its mice. Donations of money from around the world, as well as largedonations of laboratory mice with known genetics, allowed the lab to resume itswork in 1948.Among those donated mice was one with a particular recessive mutation not seenuntil subsequent generations (in the summer of 1949), where deliberateinbreeding caused a mouse to be born with two copies of the gene. Such recessivegenes are often genes that have become damaged and no longer code for usefulproteins. When both copies of the gene are damaged, none of the protein isproduced, and the effects of the lack of that protein can be seen.In this case, the gene apparently coded for something important in theregulation of feeding and metabolism. When it was no longer there, the mousenever stopped eating and became quite obese (Ingalls, Dickie, and Snell 1950).The discoverers named the gene ob. Mice carrying the mutation in both sides ofthe DNA double helix were fat and sterile. Mice carrying the mutation in onlyone side were fertile and normal in weight, but a quarter of their offspringwere obese, sterile mice, as you would expect from a classic Mendelian recessivegene. Mice that carry two copies of the gene are called ob/ob mice. If only onecopy is there, the mice are called ob/+ mice. Normal mice are called +/+.In 1953, a researcher named Gordon Kennedy proposed that fat cells communicatedwith the brain to control feeding. In 1959, G. R. Hervey experimented with ratsand found he could induce obesity by making lesions in the brain’s hypothalamus(Hervey 1959). But he went further. He connected the blood system of a rat thathad been operated on to make it obese with the blood system of a normal rat. Thedamaged rat became obese, as expected. But the normal rat stopped eating.Something in the fat mouse was producing a signal to the hypothalamus, and asthe rat got fatter, more of the signal was produced. The rat with an intacthypothalamus saw the extra signal and ceased feeding. It just wasn’t hungry.In 1966, another recessive gene was discovered by Doug Coleman in mice. This oneproduced diabetes, and he named it db. Carriers are called db/db mice.When the blood system of an ob/ob mouse is connected to a +/+ mouse (i.e., anormal, or so called wild-type mouse), the obese mouse loses weight. The signalto stop eating is coming from the normal mouse, which is not affected by thechange—it continues to eat normally. When a db/db mouse is connected to a normalmouse, the normal mouse stops eating, but the db/db mouse is unaffected.Coleman proposed that the db/db mice were overproducing a signal that they couldnot respond to, and the ob/ob mice were failing to produce the same signal, yetcould respond to it when it came from another mouse. The ob gene produced thechemical signal, and the db gene produced the protein receptor for it. Thereceptor was in the hypothalamus, because lesions there caused obesity.In 1994, after an eight-year program to find the gene, Jeffrey Friedmansucceeded, and showed that the gene is expressed only in fat cells. His teammanufactured the hormone and showed that it cured obesity in ob/ob mice, andnamed it leptin (Friedman 2010). For this work, Friedman won the prestigiousLasker Award and many other prizes.Leptin is one of many hormones produced by fat cells (adipocytes). Manydifferent tissues in the body listen for the leptin signal, so it has broadreach and several functions (Kahn and Flier 2000). It has large effects onsatiety, by acting on the brain’s hypothalamus. People and animals with damagedleptin function are always hungry, and if allowed to eat at will, they becomeseverely obese. But it also has effects on energy expenditure, raising themetabolic rate so that more energy is burned (Mistry, Swick, and Romsos 1997).Leptin makes cells more sensitive to insulin. Injections of leptin intolaboratory mice lower both glucose levels and insulin levels.Conversely, insulin also affects leptin sensitivity in the body. People who havebecome insulin resistant, and thus have high insulin levels, often become leptinresistant as a result (Kahn and Flier 2000). As leptin is a signal to stopeating, leptin resistance leads to overeating. Leptin-resistant people arealways hungry. Since obesity causes insulin resistance, and insulin resistancecauses leptin resistance, once we become obese, we are always hungry. Moreover,injecting leptin into obese patients does not help them lose weight because theyare already insensitive to it.Since leptin is made by fat cells, levels of leptin go up in proportion to thetotal amount of fat, not the fat percentage. Smaller obese people have leptinlevels similar to larger, less obese people, when the fat weight is the same ineach. Thus, the larger the body, the less likely the person is to be obese,since the leptin levels will decrease hunger. However, females have higherleptin levels than males, even after correcting for differences in body fatpercentage. Male hormones appear to suppress leptin (Rosenbaum et al. 2011).Leptin works directly on the hypothalamus in the brain to depress appetite, butit also has direct effects on other tissues and organs. Leptin is produced byfat cells, but it also affects fat cells. This is called an autocrine effect.The effect is to make fat cells less responsive to insulin, in contrast to itseffects on other tissues, which is to make them more responsive to insulin(Pérez et al. 2004). When leptin levels are high, the fat cells are telling oneanother not to listen to insulin’s signals telling them to store more fat. Thisnatural control function breaks down when insulin levels get too high and causeleptin resistance. Leptin levels then start to rise in an attempt to compensate;this is called hyperleptinemia. This causes further insulin insensitivity in thefat cells. These positive feedback effects (vicious circles) are quite common inobesity. The good news is that since fat makes us fat, losing fat helps us losemore fat.The effect leptin has on fat cells by making them less sensitive to insulin isnot surprising, as obesity is the major factor in causing insulin resistance.Insulin sensitivity can be restored by surgical removal of visceral fat—fatinside the body, around the organs, not the fat under the skin that liposuctionremoves. Besides removing fat, drugs such as Metformin also work by making cellsmore sensitive to insulin.In non-leptin-resistant people (people without metabolic syndrome), cells arestill sensitive to leptin, and leptin injections cause cells to stop making newfat, to break up existing triglycerides, and to increase the burning of bothfatty acids and glucose. It also suppresses the proliferation of new white fatcells (Harris 2014). In effect, all of this is the opposite of what insulindoes.When we eat a meal, about 40 percent of the calories go to the muscles and otherperipheral tissues to be used as fuel directly. The remaining 60 percent of thecalories end up in the liver, where they are stored to be released graduallybetween meals. If we are leptin resistant, much of the first 40 percent is notabsorbed by the tissues and ends up back in the liver, where it is stored in fatdroplets, creating fatty liver disease. Leptin resistance also interferes withthe low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDL cholesterol) in the liver, allowingthe bad cholesterol to stay in the blood, where it is prone to dangerousoxidation.Fat is not just stored in fat cells. Almost all cells store lipids (fats) indroplets inside the cell (Susuki et al. 2011). Muscle cells store fats in lipiddroplets and thus have a ready source of energy when needed. Leptin affectsmuscle cells by increasing the burning of fat and decreasing the conversion offatty acids into triglycerides for storage. This is the exact opposite of whatinsulin does. By preventing the muscles from making triglycerides, leptin helpsto keep them sensitive to insulin (Pérez et al. 2004). Leptin does not inhibitinsulin-stimulated glucose metabolism in muscles (Muoio et al. 1997), so glucoseburning still goes on there.Leptin affects pancreatic beta cells, the cells that produce insulin. Like mostcells, these cells store fats in tiny lipid droplets. Leptin inhibits this fatstorage, both by increasing the rate at which fatty acids are burned and byinhibiting the formation of fat from free fatty acids. Pancreatic beta cells arethe cells that produce insulin. They become dysfunctional when they have toomuch fat stored in them (lipotoxicity) (Shimabukuro et al. 1997).Leptin affects the liver. It reduces tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), aninflammatory molecule produced by the liver that is associated with fatty liverdisease. Leptin acts on the liver to decrease fat accumulation in the liver andto reduce the liver production of larger cholesterol particles (Huynh et al.2012). Leptin’s effects on the brain lead to downstream effects that make theliver more sensitive to insulin.When we are leptin resistant (remember that we become leptin resistant due tohigh levels of insulin caused by insulin resistance, which is caused by sugarand easily digested starches), the liver has to process the calories that theinsulin-resistant muscle cells refused to burn. It does this by packing theenergy into LDL particles. If the meal was high in carbohydrates, the liverproduces the dangerous small dense form of LDL that causes heart disease andstroke. If the meal was high in fat, the liver produces the benign large fluffyLDL particles. These particles are too large to wedge themselves into the arterylinings, and instead they end up where they belong, in fat cells. Fructose inparticular makes the most of the dangerous small dense LDL that damages thearteries.Leptin is also involved in the metabolism drop that happens with weight lossfrom calorie restriction. Injections of leptin reverse that effect, as doesfasting, which improves insulin sensitivity, and thus leptin sensitivity(Ramachandrappa and Farooqi 2011). Leptin also stimulates inflammation, and isthus one of the links between obesity and inflammatory diseases.BROWN FATLeptin affects brown fat (brown adipose tissue). Brown adipose tissue is aspecial form of fat whose purpose is to generate body heat. It is most apparentin infants, since body heat is most easily lost when the ratio of skin surfaceto total body weight is high. The smaller the organism is, the higher that ratiois, since surface area grows with the square of the radius (thus square inchesof surface), while body weight grows with the cube of the radius (it is measuredin cubic inches). Adults have brown fat, but as a percentage of body weight itis much smaller than in infants.Brown fat burns fat, and to some extent glucose, but does not use the energy foranything. Instead, it just lets it turn into heat. Leptin acts on brown fat tostimulate this effect, called thermogenesis. Burning calories for heat makesthem unavailable to be stored as fat. Activating brown fat lowers bloodtriglycerides and cholesterol, reduces atherosclerosis, and makes cells moresensitive to insulin (Chondronikola et al. 2014). Brown fat activation increaseslevels of adiponectin, a hormone that regulates glucose and fatty acid burning.Eating too much (caloric excess) normally activates brown fat, as a way ofgetting rid of the extra calories. This is called diet-induced thermogenesis.Besides leptin and overeating, cold exposure is another way to activate brownfat. Exercising in cold temperatures—one study used 60°F for two hours(Lichtenbelt et al. 2009)—can raise brown fat activity fifteenfold. Brown fatactivity is lower in obese people than in lean people. But it is not knownwhether the obesity is exacerbated by low brown fat activity, or whether obesepeople have less need for thermogenesis due to the insulating nature of fat orthe smaller surface-to-volume ratio inherent in obesity. Nonetheless, there isevidence that obese people can activate their brown fat by exercising in cooltemperatures (low 60s), and that this increases the burning of glucose and fats.Brown fat is not the only mechanism involved. Muscle cells, being much morenumerous than brown fat cells, are where the most thermogenesis occurs duringexercise in the cold.One study found that when activated by cold, brown fat consumed an extra 79calories for every 15 milliliters of brown fat, for as long as the cooling wasin effect (Cypess et al. 2012). As the average test subject had more than 50milliliters of brown fat, this amounts to increasing metabolic rate by about 260calories.Mirabegron, a drug used to treat overactive bladder, has been shown to activatebrown fat (Cypess et al. 2015). It is estimated that a 200-milligram dose couldlead to an average loss of 22 pounds in three years, based on a 200 calorie perday peak energy expenditure increase.Exercise itself may help to convert the progenitors of white fat cells intobrownish fat cells (Harms and Seale 2012). These converted white fat cells areknown as beige fat. This beige fat is stimulated by the hormone melatonin, thesleep hormone. Getting a good night’s sleep is important for weight management.Exposure to blue light after the sun goes down interferes with circadianrhythms, preventing melatonin production. Television and computer screens arethe most common source of blue light exposure in the evening.The polyphenols in fruits like dark grapes and berries aid in converting whitefat into beige fat, and increase thermogenesis (S. Wang et al. 2015). One suchpolyphenol is resveratrol, found in red wine and red grapes. The best sources ofpolyphenols are blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, grapes, and apples.In some people (44 percent of Europeans, 5 percent of Africans), a geneticmutation prevents the conversion of the progenitor cells of white fat fromturning into beige fat. These people are more prone to higher BMI and obesitythan those who do not carry the mutation.A class of diabetes drugs called thiazolidinediones (TZDs) can activatethermogenesis in beige fat cells, as can cold exposure and the exercise-inducedhormone irisin. Unlike brown fat, beige fat does not burn energy until it isactivated. Without activation, the beige fat cells act like white fat cells.This ability to switch between energy storage and energy dissipation seems to beunique to beige fat cells.Another activator of beige fat cells is the immune system. Exposure to coldinduces immune cells called eosinophils to release what are called type 2cytokines, such as interleukin-4 and interleukin-13. These molecules areproduced by a class of hormones called catecholamines and are part of the“fight-or-flight” systems, generally controlled by the adrenal glands.Catecholamines include adrenaline, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Drugs thatblock these hormones, called beta blockers, can interfere with the activation ofbeige fat and contribute to obesity.ADIPONECTINImage [images/89.jpg]In 1996, only two years after the discovery that fat cells secreted the hormoneleptin, researchers in the Japanese Human Genome Project were studying geneexpression in adipose tissue (fat), looking for other hormones secretedexclusively by this tissue. This was the first truly systematic analysis done ongene expression in fat cells, and it hit pay dirt with the discovery of the geneapM1 (adipose most abundant gene transcript 1), so named because it occurredmost abundantly in adipose tissue. The researchers found it near a location onchromosome 3 that had been linked to diabetes susceptibility (Maeda andMatsuzawa 2014).The protein that apM1 codes for is the hormone adiponectin. Receptors for thehormone are found in the muscles (AdipoR1) and in the liver (AdipoR2).Adiponectin is found in forms called multimers, so named because they containmultiple copies of the protein bound together. The two receptors respond todifferent forms of the protein, with skeletal muscle binding to a globular form,and liver cells binding to the full-length form.One of the many hormones produced in fat cells, both brown and white,adiponectin is an important regulator of glucose and fatty acid metabolism. Lowlevels of adiponectin are associated with metabolic syndrome: obesity, diabetes,insulin resistance, and so on.Adiponectin acts in the liver to slow the production of blood glucose. It actsin muscle cells to increase glucose uptake from the blood. It promotes theburning of fat and clears fat from the blood. It makes cells more sensitive toinsulin, and it reduces the production of the inflammatory molecule tumornecrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha).When we have lots of fat on our bodies, we produce lots of leptin. Leptinreduces the levels of adiponectin. We have more fat cells, but they areproducing less adiponectin. Since adiponectin is needed for insulin sensitivity,getting fat makes us become insulin resistant. Moreover, it is the harmfulvisceral (central) fat that lowers adiponectin levels the most, whilesubcutaneous fat has a much lower effect (Maeda and Matsuzawa 2014). Thevisceral fat inhibits adiponectin production.When we lose fat, leptin levels fall and adiponectin levels rise. We mightbecome hungrier, since the leptin signal is down, but we are burning more bloodsugar and blood triglycerides, we are more sensitive to insulin (Yadav et al.2013), and we have less inflammation.Besides making cells more insulin sensitive by binding to the receptors AdipoR1and AdipoR2, adiponectin makes us burn fat, which reduces free fatty acids inthe muscles. The muscles thus become more insulin sensitive, since fatty acidsinterfere with the insulin signal. The insulin can then tell the muscles to burnmore glucose, and to store excess glucose in the muscle cells as glycogen foruse later.Adiponectin protects arteries from atherosclerosis, and excess leptin levelsdamage arteries by increasing inflammation. The ratio of leptin to adiponectinin the blood is thus an indication of atherosclerosis risk, and can be tested.The endothelial cells that line our arteries have adiponectin receptors, andthey release nitric oxide when there is enough adiponectin in the blood. Nitricoxide relaxes the artery walls, allowing them to open more, thereby reducingblood pressure (Maeda and Matsuzawa 2014).GHRELINThe image to the right is the precursor protein for ghrelin. The aqua-coloredpart in the center is ghrelin.Image [images/91.jpg]The discovery of the hormone ghrelin was a long time coming. It started in 1962with a program to isolate hormones that affect the hypothalamus, which includegrowth hormone–releasing hormone (GHRH), which controls the release of humangrowth hormone (HGH) (Bowers 2012). This was aided by another program that madesynthetic peptides (small proteins) designed to fit into receptors for severalother hormones, including opioids. Since opioids were known to stimulate therelease of growth hormone, these synthetic peptides were tested to see if theycould also stimulate the release of growth hormone.Between 1976 and 1980, the program created a set of growth hormone–releasingpeptides (GHRPs) that, while not naturally produced in any organism, nonethelessfit into the receptor and released growth hormone. By 1982, GHRP-6, a veryeffective synthetic hormone made up of six amino acids, had been created.Despite years of trying to find the natural hormone (GHRH) in hypothalamustissue, in that same year (1982), it was finally found in a pancreatic tumor,which was releasing abnormally large amounts of it.By 1989, it was becoming apparent that GHRP-6 and the natural hormone GHRH wereactually activating two different receptors in the brain and involved differentmechanisms.In a completely surprising discovery, it was found that GHRP-6 increased foodintake in rats when it was directly administered to the brain. Up until thispoint (1995), the work had all been related to growth hormone stimulation in thepituitary and hypothalamus. Combining GHRP-6 and the natural GHRH hormonemagnified this appetite-increasing effect.In 1999, a group of Japanese researchers, having unsuccessfully worked for yearsto find the natural peptide that fit the growth hormone receptor, noticed thatthe receptor had similarities to another receptor and concluded that whateverpeptide fit the second receptor might also fit the first. The second receptor(GPR38) was expressed in the stomach, so they looked for its hormone in stomachtissues.That is where they found the long-sought natural hormone that stimulated therelease of growth hormone. They say they named it ghrelin, not because it was agrowth hormone–releasing hormone, but from the Indo-European root “ghre,” whichmeans “grow.” Other hormones, such as insulin, adiponectin, oxytocin,oxyntomodulin, and irisin, end in “in,” so we get “ghrelin” (Kojima and Kangawa2013).The hormone ghrelin is produced in the stomach and acts in a way opposite toleptin. While leptin produced in fat cells decreases appetite, ghrelin increasesappetite. Ghrelin also decreases the rate at which we burn glucose and fat. Ittells the body it’s running out of food, so stop wasting it.When we become insulin resistant, the high levels of insulin in the bloodinterfere with ghrelin’s signals. Insulin’s job is to get rid of blood sugar, soit reduces the amount of ghrelin, and the muscles keep burning glucose and fat.Thyroid hormone, which regulates metabolism, has a similar effect, reducingghrelin so that more fuel is burned. People with overactive thyroid glands burnenergy faster.As we get fatter, ghrelin production declines. This makes sense; since we haveplenty of stored energy, we don’t need a signal to eat more. The problem is thatoften the reason we get fat is that we are eating when we aren’t hungry, notbecause ghrelin is telling us to eat. So we continue to eat when we aren’thungry, and we get fat enough to become leptin resistant, and we become hungryall the time.Ghrelin is produced in the stomach in its inactive form. It is activated by theaddition of a medium-chain fatty acid (usually octanoate) to the ghrelinmolecule. During fasting, mobilization of free fatty acids occurs, and uponfeeding, this mobilization is suppressed, and this leads to more activatedghrelin during fasting (Arafat et al. 2013). When ghrelin stimulates appetite,it stimulates a desire for fats more than for protein or carbohydrate (Beck2006). Contrast this with neuropeptide Y, the powerful appetite-stimulatinghormone that causes a preference for carbohydrate.Glucagon reduces levels of ghrelin. This happens in lean and obese individuals.However, in obese individuals, this reduction in ghrelin does not cause satiety,as it does in lean people. Obese people remain hungry. They appear to beresistant to the appetite-suppressing power of glucagon, despite the lowerghrelin levels.Ghrelin is mainly produced in the stomach but is also produced in the upperdigestive tract, the lungs, the pancreas, the gonads, the adrenal cortex, theplacenta, the brain, and the kidneys. Ghrelin receptors are found in othertissues, notably the lining of the arteries, where ghrelin protects againstatherosclerosis (X. Xu et al. 2008).Ghrelin is not just an appetite stimulant. It also manages the output side ofthe energy equation. It adjusts the amount of energy going into fat storage,glycogen storage, and into creating body heat. It also adjusts the mechanicalsensors in the stomach that tell us whether the stomach is distended or not (A.Page et al. 2007). The more ghrelin there is, the less sensitive we are to afull stomach. This is why when we eat too quickly, it is so easy to overeat. Theghrelin levels have not had a chance to fall, so we are not as sensitive to thepressure signals we are getting from the stomach.Ghrelin’s actions in the brain are not limited to appetite control in thehypothalamus. Ghrelin also affects the dopamine circuits in the brain’s rewardcenter, which control addiction (Skibicka et al. 2012). Without ghrelin, thereis no reward for alcohol or highly palatable foods (Egecioglu et al. 2010).Limiting desserts and alcohol to times when we have low ghrelin levels, such aswhen we are full, may help to reduce the addictive nature of these consumables.Ghrelin has antidepression effects, and it decreases anxiety (Lutter et al.2008).Ghrelin as an appetite stimulant increases the number of meals but not the sizeof the meals. After a fast, eating a meal slowly enough to allow ghrelin levelsto rise will thus prevent overeating.When we gain weight, ghrelin levels drop. When we lose weight, ghrelin levelsrise. This is one mechanism the body has for maintaining body fat levels(homeostasis).Ghrelin inhibits the release of insulin after a meal. If you eat only when youare hungry, the glucose will get into your system, but the insulin will take itstime. If you get carbohydrates when you aren’t feeling hungry, insulin levelsspike, causing all the problems associated with metabolic syndrome, obesity, anddiabetes.Ghrelin has anti-inflammatory effects and helps cells grow despite stress. It isbeing considered as a therapy for colitis and sepsis (Gonzalez-Rey, Chorny, andDelgado 2006). It also helps the stomach regenerate after injury to its mucosallayers.The ghrelin receptor controls a whole raft of biological functions besides thosementioned above. It releases human growth hormone (HGH), it modulates sugar andfat metabolism, it regulates gastrointestinal motility (making food move throughyour digestive system better), it protects neurons and cardiovascular cells, andit regulates the immune system (Y. Yin, Li, and Zhang 2014). All these benefitscome from feeling hungry. If you aren’t feeling hungry several times a day, youare missing out on the benefits of ghrelin.But wait, there’s more! Ghrelin acts on the brain’s hippocampus to increaselearning and memory (E. Li et al. 2013). This is important to any organism thatwants to remember where to find food or which food made it sick. If you want tolearn something, learn it while your stomach is growling. Fasting for three orfour meals makes a difference in brain function, learning, and memory. But justskipping the snacks between meals can also help, as well as lowering yourinsulin levels to prevent insulin resistance. Ghrelin actually helps you formnew brain cells, even in adulthood. It may also be that the low ghrelin levelsexperienced in obese people are what lead to the non-Alzheimer’s dementia thatis associated with obesity (E. Li et al. 2013).The next time you feel hungry, think of all the good things ghrelin is doing foryour body, and see if you can prolong the feeling for a while. Not only will yoube healthier and smarter, but you will also lose a little weight.MELANIN-CONCENTRATING HORMONE (MCH)Image [images/95.jpg]In 1983, a hormone that determined pigmentation in amphibians and fish wasisolated from salmon. The patterns of pigmentation were caused by theinteraction between two hormones, melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) andalpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH). The first one (MCH) lightensthe skin pigment cells, while the second (alpha-MSH) darkens them.In humans, these two hormones continue their antagonistic behavior but losetheir close association with pigmentation. They affect feeding (hunger), sleep,mood, and other brain functions.MCH plays a critical role in the regulation and maintenance of sleep, especiallyrapid eye movement (REM) sleep. It is produced by cells in the brain,particularly parts of the hypothalamus, and consumed by cells in all parts ofthe brain. Malfunctions in MCH production or consumption are associated withmajor depression.In addition to those functions, MCH has a role in energy homeostasis (MacNeil2013). MCH increases appetite. Mice that have had the gene for MCH removed (MCHknockout mice) are resistant to diet-induced obesity, though due tohyperactivity and increased metabolism, not less eating. Leptin lowers levels ofMCH, and injections of MCH into mouse brains raised their leptin levels by 300percent by increasing their fat mass 100 percent.Several different companies are working on drugs targeting MCH as antiobesitytreatments. So far none have finished late phase clinical trials. Given that MCHhas other important effects in the brain, such as controlling REM sleep anddepression, there might not be a lot of hope for a drug anytime soon.AGOUTI-RELATED PEPTIDE (AGRP)Image [images/96.jpg]This relationship between pigmentation, obesity, and metabolism is continued inanother hormone, named agouti-related peptide. Agouti refers to a pigmentationeffect that causes bands of color in the coats of animals by decreasing theblack pigment eumelanin, thus allowing the red pigment pheomelanin to showthrough.The agouti protein is responsible for banded coloring in mice and rabbits, andfor the patterns in bay horses (reddish coats with black manes and tails). Thischange in coloration is due to interactions with the melanin system thatprovides pigmentation. This system is closely linked with appetite and feedingcontrols, as the appetite and pigment hormones are produced from the sameprotein, called pro-opiomelanocortin, or POMC.The agouti protein is normally expressed only in the skin. Researchers workingwith obese mice found the relationship with coloration, indicating that if thisgene is expressed where it normally is not, it can lead to obesity.In 1997, two groups of researchers (Shutter et al. 1997; Ollmann et al. 1997)found a small protein (a peptide) that was very similar to the agouti protein,which was expressed eight times as much in obese mice as in normal mice. Theynamed it agouti-related peptide (AGRP).This hormone is expressed mostly in the adrenal gland and the brain, but smallamounts are produced in the lungs, kidneys, and testicles. AGRP increasesappetite. Leptin inhibits AGRP, and ghrelin activates AGRP. Both these effectsare due to the respective hormones acting in the brain on the cells that produceAGRP. Inflammatory signals also act on these cells, explaining, in part, therelationship between inflammation and obesity. In return, AGRP enhances thebody’s response to some inflammatory signaling molecules, in a feedback loop.AGRP acts on melanocortin receptors in the brain, blocking the action of theappetite-depressing hormone alpha-MSH. It not only stimulates feeding behaviorbut lowers metabolic rate.Stress interferes with AGRP in ways that can cause eating disorders andbingeing, and AGRP gene variants have been associated with the eating disorderanorexia nervosa, as well as obesity.ALPHA-MELANOCYTE-STIMULATING HORMONE (ALPHA-MSH)Image [images/97.jpg]The hormone that AGRP blocks is alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone(alpha-MSH).Alpha-MSH has several functions. It is an anti-inflammatory molecule, and itreduces fever. By itself, it is also antimicrobial, targeting both bacteria andfungi (Singh and Mukhopadhyay 2014). It protects the brain from inflammation.As a hormone, alpha-MSH has many functions. It regulates the melanin pigment inskin and hair, the secretion of sebum, temperature regulation, pain control, sexbehaviors, and learning. In energy homeostasis, it decreases appetite. Alpha-MSHacts on the melanocortin-4 receptor, the same receptor blocked by AGRP. Leptinincreases levels of alpha-MSH.High alpha-MSH levels are associated with heart disease, obesity, sepsis, HIV,and other inflammatory diseases, but also with chronic fatigue syndrome, whereit may be used as a marker for the otherwise hard-to-diagnose disease. In obesechildren, low levels of alpha-MSH were found, causing an increase in appetite(Vehapoğlu, Türkmen, and Terzioglu 2015).Alpha-MSH and the related hormones beta-MSH and gamma-MSH are produced from theprecursor protein POMC (pro-opiomelanocortin).OREXINSImage [images/98.jpg]The connection between sleep, metabolism, and energy homeostasis is deep andcomplex. Some of the main hormones linking these physiological effects are theorexins. Discovered in 1998 by two independent research groups, both workingwith rats, the hormone orexin was given two names, the other being hypocretin.The hormone comes in two forms, orexin-A (shown above) and orexin-B, both smallproteins (peptides), one with 33 amino acids and the other with 28.The orexins are produced in the brain’s hypothalamus, by cells that sendprojections throughout the brain, particularly to parts of the brain thatmodulate wakefulness. Orexins integrate metabolism, circadian rhythms, and sleepdebt signals to control whether an animal should be asleep or awake. Theyinteract with the dopamine, histamine, norepinephrine, and acetylcholineneurotransmitter systems in the brain.Orexins increase appetite. They stimulate wakefulness. They regulate energyexpenditure and control gut function. They are needed in order for cells to turninto the brown fat cells whose purpose is to generate body heat. Deficiencies inorexins lead to obesity by reducing thermogenesis. They also cause the sleepingdisorder narcolepsy, where control of sleep is disordered, along with excessivedaytime sleepiness.Orexins’ effects on energy expenditure may outweigh their effects on appetite.Orexin-deficient narcoleptic patients are obese, indicating that the lack ofenergy burning is more important than the lack of appetite.Orexins promote cravings for food but also inhibit the satiety signals thatusually accompany feeding, thus increasing meal size.Leptin, the satiety hormone produced by fat cells, lowers levels of orexins.Blood glucose also reduces orexin levels. (Hypoglycemia raises them.) Ghrelin,the hunger hormone produced in the stomach, increases orexin levels.Because sleep deprivation increases orexin levels, the body responds byincreasing energy expenditure and by increasing feeding. Sleep deprivationcauses a profound lack of energy as a result. Drugs (such as Merck’s Belsomra)that block orexin receptors cause people to fall asleep faster and sleep longer.Similar drugs also seem to block the desire for alcohol, cocaine, and nicotinein addicted laboratory rats, thus linking orexins to cravings for drugs, sweets,and rich foods.Orexin-A has a direct effect on fat cells, causing them to take up blood glucoseand make new fat, while at the same time reducing the breakdown of fat intoglycerin and fatty acids for use as fuel. It stimulates the hormone adiponectin,which turns off the production of glucose in the liver and causes cells to storeglucose.Orexins also have effects on mood, with high levels being associated withhappiness and low levels being associated with sadness. Thus, a link betweendepression, appetite, energy expenditure, obesity, and sleep owes its effect toorexins.CANNABINOIDSImage [images/99.jpg]THCIt comes as no surprise to anyone familiar with marijuana or the marijuanasubculture in popular media to know that the active componentdelta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, shown on the right), stimulates appetite.Users refer to this as “getting the munchies.” In medicine, marijuana is used toincrease body weight in patients with wasting diseases. The drug targetsreceptors in the brain that respond to molecules similar to THC, calledendogenous cannabinoids—endogenous means having an internal cause or origin;that is, they are made inside the body (Marzo and Matias 2005).Cannabinoids are under the control of leptin (Harrold and Williams 2003) andregulate energy balance, food intake, and appetite. They also act on the rewardsystem to make eating more pleasurable. They stimulate fat accumulation and theproduction of fat from blood sugar (lipogenesis). Cannabinoids also stimulateproduction of the neurotransmitter neuropeptide Y (NPY), which is a powerfulappetite stimulant, and this may be how the appetite stimulation in cannabinoidsworks (Gamber, Macarthur, and Westfall 2005).COCAINE- AND AMPHETAMINE-REGULATED TRANSCRIPT (CART)Image [images/100.jpg]The link between appetite and addiction is clear. Not only do we use terms ofdrug addiction in relation to desirable foods (“addictive chocolate,”“overdosing on sugar”), but we use appetite terms when talking about drugaddiction (“craving cocaine”). The link is more than just a language shortcut,however. The key signaling molecules and receptors for them are shared.Addictive drugs hijack the circuits in the brain that cause us to becomeaddicted to sugar and fat.Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) is a small protein(peptide) that produces behaviors in the brain similar to those of cocaine andamphetamines. It also has a role in energy homeostasis and appetite. It isregulated by the appetite-controlling hormones leptin, ghrelin, andcholecystokinin. Leptin increases levels of CART, as does cholecystokinin.Ghrelin suppresses CART (Lartigue et al. 2007).CART is an anorectic hormone (it decreases appetite). In addition to its owneffects, it seems to magnify the hunger-decreasing effect of cholecystokinin. Itinteracts with the dopamine circuits in the brain that control desire, craving,reward, and addiction. CART stimulates the synthesis of alpha-MSH, anappetite-suppressing hormone.CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING HORMONE (CRH)Image [images/101.jpg]Corticotropin-releasing hormone is a 41-amino acid peptide (small protein) thatis produced in the brain in response to stress. It is associated with majordepression and Alzheimer’s disease, and glucose metabolism and regulation. Itstimulates the release of the stress hormone cortisol.CRH decreases appetite, boosts attention, boosts energy expenditure, and causesanxiety. These are all normal reactions to stress, to make the animal ready forfight or flight. While the release of cortisol is anti-inflammatory, CRH itselfis pro-inflammatory and may be linked to multiple sclerosis. The receptor forCRH has been linked to the euphoria produced by alcohol, and drugs that blockthe receptor are being investigated as possible treatments for alcoholism.CRH has effects on energy balance beyond decreasing appetite, as it alsoincreases thermogenesis, the burning of food to produce body heat (Richard,Huang, and Timofeeva 2000).Leptin increases levels of CRH.CRH increases the production of the alpha-MSH progenitor protein POMC, fromwhich alpha- and beta-MSH, the opioids endorphins and enkephalins, and theadrenal cortex hormone ACTH, which stimulates adrenaline and norepinephrine, areformed.ESTROGENImage [images/102.jpg]Estrogen (estradiol) is the primary female sex hormone, although it is producedin both men and women and is vital to both. Estrogen affects energy balance byboth accelerating metabolism and increasing fat stores. It also suppresses bingeeating, and estrogen disorders may be involved in bulimia.Estrogen is produced primarily in the ovaries in women, but in both sexes, it isproduced by fat cells throughout the body. This is the reason obese men storefat in the breast area, as women do. It is also the reason why being overweightor obese increases a woman’s chances of developing breast cancer. Both estrogenand testosterone levels drop in women who lose weight (Campbell et al. 2012).Estrogen receptors in the brain’s hypothalamus exert control over body fatdistribution, energy expenditure, and food intake. When these receptors aredestroyed in rats, the animals eat more food, burn less energy, and gain fatmass. Estrogen is why females tend to accumulate fat under the skin, while mentend to accumulate fat abdominally, where it is associated with the harmfuleffects of metabolic syndrome. Postmenopausal women tend toward a more male-likefat distribution, due to changes in estrogen levels (Palmer and Clegg 2015).Girls in poor families gain more fat mass than their brothers despite similarpoor diets (Grantham and Henneberg 2014), a trend not seen in wealthierfamilies. In developed countries, both sexes are obese, but in less-developedcountries, obesity is more prevalent in women. This may be due to the fact thatmales in developed countries are more exposed to estrogen-like substances intheir environment and food supply.Fat cells not only produce estrogen but have receptors for estrogen as well, andthe sensitivity of these receptors varies with location in the body (Palmer andClegg 2015).Estrogen reduces the inflammation that causes obesity. Females are less pronethan males to inflammatory omega-6 fats in the diet, making them more resistantto weight gain than males when fed high omega-6 fat diets (Miller et al. 2012).Estrogen has strong effects on glucose metabolism. Both male and female micethat have the alpha receptor for estrogen knocked out have abdominal obesity,severe insulin resistance, and diabetes (Lizcano and Guzmán 2014). Estrogen alsoincreases fat burning in brown fat tissues, increasing body heat (hot flashesare not just vasodilation).Estrogen increases sensitivity to leptin (Lizcano and Guzmán 2014). Theinterplay between fat cells and estrogen is important for reproduction. Adequatefat supplies are required for fertility, and the leptin signal is how fat massis signaled to other organs and tissues. Menopausal women are three times morelikely to have metabolic syndrome and obesity as premenopausal women are, andestrogen/progestin-based hormone replacement therapy lowers visceral fat, bloodsugar, and insulin (Lizcano and Guzmán 2014).CORTISOLImage [images/103.jpg]Cortisol is the stress hormone, and stress is known to be associated withobesity. So it seems natural to suspect that cortisol might be a cause ofobesity. A disease called Cushing’s syndrome, caused by taking corticosteroidmedications such as prednisone, has many of the same symptoms as metabolicsyndrome, including obesity, insulin resistance, and hypertension. Chronicstress in primates has shown a fat distribution similar to that found inCushing’s syndrome (Fraser et al. 1999).Cortisol is in a class of hormones called glucocorticoids. These are steroidhormones that regulate glucose metabolism, in addition to their immunologiceffects. When we are fasting, cortisol stimulates several systems that maintainnormal blood sugar levels. It tells the liver to make more glucose. It mobilizesamino acids so the liver has something to convert to glucose. It inhibits theuse of glucose by muscles and fat. It stimulates fat cells to break down fats,so the glycerol can be used to make glucose. Cortisol is also important in fetaldevelopment and in regulating blood pressure.A study of a large sample of middle-aged normal subjects in Glasgow, Scotland,showed a significant association between cortisol and high BMI and highwaist-to-hip ratios (Fraser et al. 1999). Cortisol levels seemed to contributeto BMI in men but not in women. In another study, levels of cortisol in thesaliva of men taken right after they woke up in the morning showed a positivecorrelation with BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, abdominal diameter, blood glucose andinsulin levels, and blood triglycerides (Wallerius et al. 2003). However, arecent study of cortisol levels in subjects with metabolic syndrome was not ableto find a clear connection (Abraham et al. 2013).Cushing’s syndrome certainly causes weight gain. It also raises blood sugarlevels and insulin levels and can cause diabetes. But the reverse hypothesis,that weight gain is caused by cortisol, may be true only in the case ofCushing’s syndrome itself, and may not be much of a factor in everyday obesity.The association between cortisol and obesity may be the other way around, asobesity seems to cause stress. As with so many other factors relating toobesity, the cause and effect may go both ways. Stress may cause obesity, whichcauses more stress.Long-term stress with elevated cortisol levels can lead to a state calledhypocortisolism, where the body produces less cortisol than normal (Maripuu etal. 2016). The authors of that study hypothesize that long-term stress is a maincontributor to metabolic syndrome and heart disease in people with bipolardisorder or recurrent depression. A link between obesity, metabolic syndrome,heart disease, and what are called recurrent affective disorders—depression,bipolar disorder—is common. People with depression are often overweight, and thelink may be cortisol.Cortisol is produced in the cortex of the adrenal glands above the kidneys.Eating and fasting both produce cortisol, as do exercise and just waking up fromsleep. Stress also causes cortisol release.Cortisol is important in the regulation and mobilization of energy reserves inthe body. It selects which type of stored energy the body will use, whethercarbohydrate, protein, or fat. It can move fat from one place to another.Cortisol is what tells the body to move fat from under the skin and put it deepinto the abdomen. It can cause the body to make glucose from protein. It aidsnew fat cells to mature, and it can suppress the immune system so the body’senergy stores are available to fight or flee an adversary.The inactive form of cortisol is cortisone. The enzyme that converts cortisoneto the active cortisol is produced in fat cells. The gene for this enzyme ismore active in obese people than in lean people, and visceral (abdominal) fathas more of the enzyme than subcutaneous fat (fat under the skin). Visceral fathas four times the number of cortisol receptors as subcutaneous fat, and moreblood flow to mobilize the cortisol. This higher sensitivity to cortisol makesthe abdominal fat cells more responsive to cortisol’s message to increase insize. In a study of women divided into abdominal-fat and peripheral-fat groups,those with abdominal fat were more sensitive to high carbohydrate meals(Vicennati et al. 2002).Cortisol may directly affect feeding behavior by binding to receptors in thebrain’s hypothalamus, causing people to eat more foods high in sugar and fat(Epel et al. 2001). It also affects levels of leptin and neuropeptide Y, whichaffect appetite.Because cortisol is associated with both higher abdominal fat and with heartdisease, the waist-to-hip ratio has been found to be a better predictor of heartdisease than either waist circumference or BMI.Cortisol, like CRH, increases the production of the alpha-MSH progenitor proteinPOMC, from which alpha- and beta-MSH, the opioids endorphins and enkephalins,and the adrenal cortex hormone ACTH, which stimulates adrenaline andnorepinephrine, are formed. All these systems interact with consequences forenergy balance, appetite, and obesity.EPINEPHRINE (ADRENALINE) AND NOREPINEPHRINEEpinephrine is a hormone produced in the adrenal glands. It is thefight-or-flight hormone that prepares the body for dealing with life-or-deathsituations. It is the hormone that causes the shakiness, anxiety, sweating, fastheart rate, and raised blood pressure after a good scare.Image [images/106-1.jpg]EpinephrineImage [images/106-2.jpg]NorepinephrineIn less stressful times, it helps to manage blood sugar by making the musclesmore sensitive to insulin. This is particularly useful during times of dietaryexcess (Ziegler et al. 2011).Norepinephrine is a very similar molecule. It is epinephrine without the extracarbon and hydrogens (on the right side of the molecule in the illustrationabove). It is released by the nervous system as well as by the adrenal glands.It is also part of the fight-or-flight response, promoting vigilance, memory,and attention.In a study of people with metabolic syndrome, levels of norepinephrine excretedin the urine were higher than normal, while levels of epinephrine were lowerthan normal (Z. Lee et al. 2001).Epinephrine acts on visceral fat to release free fatty acids, which causeinsulin resistance in muscle tissue (Surwit et al. 2010). Muscles are theprimary way blood sugar is reduced—as insulin rises, muscles take glucose fromthe blood and both burn it and store it as glycogen in the muscle tissue. Thisis one mechanism that links obesity to diabetes.Epinephrine moves fat from deposits under the skin into the blood. In childhoodobesity, there is a decrease in the sensitivity of fat deposits to epinephrine,which may be a contributing factor, or a cause, of obesity in children studied(Bougnères et al. 1997).Epinephrine lowers levels of the satiety hormone leptin. This causes stressedanimals, and humans, to eat more (Carulli et al. 1999). Since leptin increasesthe burning of glucose and fat, lower levels help maintain body fat.HUMAN GROWTH HORMONE (HGH)Human growth hormone (HGH) is produced in the pituitary gland at the base of thebrain. In children and adolescents, it stimulates growth and development, as thename implies. In adults, it increases muscle mass and decreases fat mass. Alone,it has little effect as a treatment for obesity, but in conjunction with dietaryrestriction, it accelerates fat loss (Kim et al. 1999).Image [images/107.jpg]In the liver, human growth hormone is converted into insulin-like growth factorI (IGF-I). This hormone is highest during the growth spurts in puberty. As thename implies, it binds to the insulin receptor, but only about 1 percent as wellas insulin binds to it. Thus it reduces blood sugar levels in the same way asinsulin—just 1 percent as much.Injections of human growth hormone alone into obese adults have not shown mucheffect on obesity. Weight does not change, despite small reductions in fat massand increases in muscle mass. HGH is effective only when injected. In oral form,it is just another protein that gets quickly broken down and digested, withoutentering the bloodstream in any useful form. The easiest and cheapest way toincrease blood levels of HGH is through fasting (Ho et al. 1988). Fasting fortwo days can raise HGH levels by a factor of five (Hartman et al. 1992). Fastingfor 40 days in one case raised levels to 12½ times normal, without apparent sideeffects.HGH counters the effects of insulin. Along with cortisol and adrenaline, ittells the body to increase the availability of glucose. Thus, raising HGH willraise blood sugar, which is safe only when fasting while awake, as blood sugarlevels are low at that time. Raising HGH while not fasting can cause insulinresistance. There are also associations with enlarged hearts and increasedprostate cancer incidence, which is not surprising, since it is a growth hormoneand has higher levels in men.Another way to raise HGH levels is sustained high-intensity workouts(low-intensity workouts have been found to have no effect, and resistancetraining was better than aerobic exercise). Vitamin D3 increases circulatingIGF-I, with similar effects—5,000 to 7,000 IUs of D3 per week (Ameri et al.2013).On the other hand, abdominal fat and high insulin levels, as found with insulinresistance, reduce HGH levels (Clasey et al. 2001). So visceral fat reducesgrowth hormone leading to more visceral fat. In adults with growth hormonedeficiency disease, there is an accumulation of visceral fat (Rasmussen 2010).Likewise, high-fat, high-sugar diets decrease growth hormone levels (Cappon etal. 2009). Drinking alcohol also lowers growth hormone levels (Prinz et al.2009).As mentioned earlier, sleep deprivation reduces HGH levels.The hunger hormone ghrelin causes the release of HGH into the blood. This is whyfasting raises HGH levels, as fasting leads to high ghrelin levels.BRANCHED-CHAIN AMINO ACIDSImage [images/108-1.jpg]LeucineImage [images/108-2.jpg]IsoleucineImage [images/108-3.jpg]ValineAmino acids are the building blocks of protein, and there are three amino acidsin particular that affect muscles and appetite hormones. These are leucine,isoleucine, and valine (as shown in the images on this page). They are calledbranched-chain amino acids because they are molecules that split or branch inthe portion that does not connect to other amino acids (the all-gray parts inthe images on the previous page). Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are themost abundant of the nine essential amino acids (those we cannot make, which arethus essential to the diet). Of the three, leucine is the most abundant,accounting for over 20 percent of total protein in the human diet.These three amino acids are regulators of satiety, leptin, and glucose (She etal. 2007). They are increased in obese people, possibly due to breakdown ofmuscle tissue as a result of insulin resistance, and possibly because obesityinterferes with enzymes for digesting BCAAs. To prevent muscle breakdown,athletes supplement with these three amino acids when doing strenuous exercise.Supplementing before and after exercise reduces exercise-induced muscle damageand promotes muscle-protein building (Negro et al. 2008). Under normalcircumstances, there are enough of these amino acids in a daily diet, even acalorie restricted one, to maintain muscle mass.BCAAs are beneficial in lean animals, including humans. They promote glucosetolerance, enhance glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity, and decrease bodyfat. But in obese animals, insulin resistance cancels these effects and allowsharmful accumulation of BCAAs and their breakdown products. High-fat diets canproduce insulin resistance, but in combination with a high-fat diet,branched-chain amino acids produce insulin resistance even though weight gainand food intake drop (Newgard et al. 2009). They interfere with the insulinreceptor molecule, making it ineffective (Chen and Yang 2015).Each of the different BCAAs has a different effect in the body. The BCAA valineregulates fatty acid transport across blood vessel walls, allowing fatty acidsinto muscles, where they create insulin resistance (Jang et al. 2016). The BCAAleucine uncouples insulin signaling, also creating insulin resistance (Lynch andAdams 2014). The BCAAs leucine and isoleucine are broken down in mature fatcells and account for 30 percent of the energy used in making new fat (Green etal. 2016).Circulating levels of these three amino acids are higher in the blood of obesepeople than in lean people. There are a few possible reasons for this, and oneor all of them might be in effect (Chen and Yang 2015). Obese people eat more,so there is more protein to break down into amino acids. Fat cells break downBCAAs to make fat, and when fat cells are enlarged in obese people, thisbreakdown is impaired. Insulin resistance leads to muscle breakdown, releasingBCAAs.Part of the damage caused by insulin resistance is due to the breakdown productsof BCAAs during the abnormal metabolism of them in fat cells. These toxicmetabolites of BCAAs harm the energy processing mitochondria in cells andtrigger the stress response associated with insulin resistance (Chen and Yang2015). BCAAs interact with the pancreas, changing the levels of insulin andglucagon, and may play a role in the pancreatic damage that leads to diabetes.Higher than normal BCAA levels in the blood are one of the first indicators ofinsulin resistance. These levels are elevated in obese people, even those whoare not yet insulin resistant. In people with metabolic syndrome, they areelevated even more than in the merely obese. Blood tests for elevated BCAAs—anindicator of problems yet to come in obese patients—may soon become a usefuldiagnostic tool. Catching diabetes early, before major damage is done topancreatic cells, is important, and this diagnostic test can find problemsbefore other symptoms are evident.NEUROPEPTIDE YImage [images/110.jpg]Discovered in 1982, neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a 36-amino acid small protein(peptide) that has many functions in the brain and nervous system. It is one ofthe most potent stimulators of appetite in the brain (Beck 2006), with apreference for carbohydrate consumption. It makes us eat sooner, eat more, andeat longer. It acts as a vasoconstrictor, raising blood pressure by constrictingblood vessels. It causes the growth of fat tissue and blood vessels. It reducesstress and anxiety, reduces sensitivity to pain, and reduces desire for alcohol.It is one of the most abundant peptides in the brain (Beck 2006).NPY stimulates the release of the stress hormone corticotropin-releasing hormone(CRH), and thus controls anxiety and thermogenesis (production of body heat).NPY and CRH generally have opposite effects and act as negative feedbacks tokeep tight control over blood pressure and other functions. NPY raises CRH,which lowers NPY.High-sugar, high-fat diets stimulate the release of NPY, increasing appetite andcausing fat storage in the abdomen. Normally, levels of NPY increase when foodis restricted and decrease upon feeding.Beyond making us eat sooner, and eat longer, NPY motivates us to seek food, andmice will put up with electric shocks or go to more effort to get food than whenNPY levels are low (Beck 2006). NPY also makes us prefer carbohydrates toprotein or fat, and this effect is stronger if the carbohydrate is sugar insteadof starch. Nonnutritive sweeteners such as saccharin are also preferred. It isthe sweetness we seek, not the calories.Leptin works in part by reducing neuropeptide Y (NPY) (Mistry, Swick, and Romsos1997). Fasting for 24 to 96 hours dramatically raises NPY levels (Beck 2006),and feeding quickly brings the NPY levels back to normal. This is likely due tochanges in blood glucose levels, which the brain can directly measure, sinceinsulin injections, which lower blood sugar, raise NPY levels. When glucose andNPY are injected at the same time, there is less appetite stimulation.The interaction with leptin works the other way as well. Increases in NPY causeincreases in the release of leptin by fat cells (Sainsbury et al. 1996). The fatcells thus act as a brake on NPY production—a negative feedback loop.NPY is also regulated by time. It rises at feeding times if those times areregular (Kalra and Kalra 2003).The appetite stimulation of NPY is dependent on two opioid receptors in thebrain: the mu and kappa receptors. Opioid receptors are critical to the brain’sreward system and are a major part of why certain foods are addictive, but themolecules that trigger these receptors (called endogenous opioids), likeendorphin and dynorphin, themselves stimulate feeding behavior, apart from theirreward effects (Israel et al. 2005). NPY also interacts with other appetitecontrol systems in the brain, such as alpha-MSH and the melanocortin system(Beck 2006) and the orexins. These interactions may link feeding to thesleep/wake cycle (Willie et al. 2001).GLP-1Image [images/112.jpg]There are cells in the intestines that secrete hormones during the process ofdigestion that signal to the rest of the body what is coming. The cells areknown by letters: the K cells secrete the hormone GIP; the L cells secrete thehormones GLP-1, PYY, oxyntomodulin, and GLP-2; the I cells secrete the hormonecholecystokinin; and the G cells secrete the hormone gastrin (Gutierrez-Aguilarand Woods 2011).Glucagon-like polypeptide-1 is a small protein (peptide) that is broken out ofthe same larger protein that glucagon is cleaved from. That protein is calledpreproglucagon. Unlike glucagon, which raises blood sugar levels, GLP-1 causesthe pancreas to secrete more insulin to lower blood sugar. Hormones thatincrease insulin are called incretins. GLP-1 also reduces the levels ofglucagon, thus it has two ways to respond to sudden surges in glucose.GLP-1 responds only to rising glucose levels, and is quickly destroyed(half-life of about two minutes) by an enzyme so it does not hang around whenglucose levels are stable. It also slows acid release into the stomach, andslows the emptying of the stomach. This delays the digestion of carbohydrates,so blood sugar doesn’t spike, and contributes to the sensation of satiety. Inother words, GLP-1 decreases hunger.Besides reacting to glucose, GLP-1 is also stimulated by ingested fats. When thebody detects fat in the intestine, GLP-1 reduces intestinal motility, the speedwith which food travels in the intestines. This allows fat more time to bedigested.The K and L cells that respond to glucose in the intestines do so using the sametypes of sensors found on the tongue: sweet, sour, bitter, etc. Artificialsweeteners affect these sensors as well and can cause trouble by making the bodythink it is getting a big meal full of glucose when it isn’t. The result is aflood of insulin into the blood, which tells muscles to burn glucose, and fatcells to store it. The resulting low blood sugar makes us ravenous, and we gofind some real food. And those fat cells that sucked up the glucose stay fat.The sweet sensors on the tongue send signals to the K cells, telling them toexpect glucose. This is why the satiety effects of the incretins GLP-1 and PPcan occur within 20 minutes of eating, despite the fact that it takes longerthan that for the food to actually reach the far ends of the intestines wherethe K cells are found.Besides being secreted in the large intestine and the last third of the smallintestine, GLP-1 is secreted by cells in the brain. There, it has severaleffects. It decreases the pleasure we get from food, and decreases themotivation to eat, along with decreasing the amount we eat and how often we eat.It slows down motor activity so we can more easily digest the meal that justraised GLP-1 levels. It can also increase anxiety and the sense of nausea.GLP-1 increases insulin sensitivity (Sanz et al. 2015). It is required to getthe high-fat diet protection provided by inulin (Vrieze et al. 2013). It alsointeracts with the immune system.GLP-1 also has effects in the body that are not related to glucose metabolism.It reduces atherosclerosis by preventing the immune cells called monocytes fromadhering to artery walls. It activates the immune cells called macrophages byactivating the nuclear transcriptor STAT-3 (signal transducers and activator oftranscription 3) (Seino and Yabe 2013). GLP-1 increases the production of nitricoxide (NO), which dilates capillaries, thus increasing blood flow into tissues.It stimulates the proliferation of the cells lining the blood vessels(endothelial cells). It reduces the production of harmful reactive oxygenspecies that cause oxidative damage.GLP-1 has several cardioprotective properties. It increases glucose oxidation inheart cells, improves the amount of blood pumped, reduces hardening of thearteries, and prevents cardiac cell death. The vascular protective functions ofGLP-1 are also evident in the brain, where it helps to prevent damage and neuroncell death from stroke. GLP-1 also reduces hypertension (high blood pressure),as we would expect since it stimulates production of nitric oxide, but it alsohelps the body to excrete excess sodium (salt increases blood pressure) (Seinoand Yabe 2013).GLP-1 reduces the amount of fat in the blood by reducing the creation of fattyacids and by limiting the absorption of fat in the intestines. In the brainGLP-1 and the related hormone GIP are important in synaptic plasticity andmemory formation and have protective properties against Alzheimer’s disease.OXYNTOMODULIN (OXM)Image [images/114.jpg]Oxyntomodulin is another hormone cleaved from the preproglucagon protein. It issecreted along with GLP-1 and PYY when food is ingested, and it is secreted inproportion to the calories consumed. Like those other two hormones, it acts as asatiety signal, decreasing hunger. OXM reduces levels of the hunger hormoneghrelin.Oxyntomodulin gets its name from its function of modifying (decreasing) gastricacid secretion in the stomach by glands called oxyntic glands. Oxyntic means“acid-secreting.” These glands are also known as fundic glands, as they arefound in an area of the stomach called the fundus.OXM binds to both the GLP-1 receptor and the glucagon receptor, and because ofthat dual binding, it has greater weight-reducing power than either of those twohormones alone (Pocai 2013). It can bind to the glucagon receptor because it ispretty much glucagon plus a few more amino acids from the preproglucagonprecursor molecule. By simultaneously stimulating glucose production by bindingto the glucagon receptor, and halting glucose production by binding to the GLP-1receptor, thus triggering insulin release, it makes the body more sensitive toinsulin without raising blood sugar levels.In the liver, the glucagon receptor stimulates glucose production, while in thebrain (specifically the hypothalamus), the glucagon receptor starts a signal tothe liver to stop producing glucose. By stimulating both, and stimulatinginsulin production at the same time, OXM is a potent regulator of glucose,preventing dangerous hyperglycemia.By stimulating the glucagon receptor, OXM slows the emptying of the stomach, asglucagon does. This slows the absorption of glucose into the blood, preventingspikes in blood sugar and the resulting spikes in insulin.In the pancreas, oxyntomodulin stimulates secretion of insulin, somatostatin,and glucagon.Somatostatin is another hormone that reduces gastric acid secretion. In anothernegative feedback control function, it reduces insulin and glucagon, acting inopposition to OXM. Somatostatin also slows stomach emptying.Image [images/115.jpg]SomatostatinWhen OXM stimulates insulin, it does so in proportion to the amount of glucosedetected in the blood. This helps to closely control the rate of insulinproduction.Subcutaneous injections of oxyntomodulin cause weight loss in both humans androdents, increase core body temperature (burning calories faster), increaseheart rate, and improve glucose metabolism (Pocai 2013). Unlike GLP-1, it doesnot reduce the palatability of food, but it does reduce appetite.While surgical procedures like gastric banding and gastric bypass surgery wereoriginally done to limit the size of the stomach, and thus reduce calorieintake, it has since been shown that one of the main reasons for the success ofthese procedures is that they cause exaggerated release of the hormones OXM,glucagon, PYY, and GLP-1 after meals (Chandarana and Batterham 2012). Surgerymight be avoided if these hormones could be injected before meals. However, thebody very quickly destroys these hormones enzymatically, so they are accuratesignals of calorie intake. Making synthetic versions of these hormones that donot degrade quickly is an area of active research for drugs that control obesityand diabetes.PEPTIDE YYImage [images/116.jpg]Another hormone produced by the last parts of the intestine is a 36-amino acidpeptide called peptide YY. It is produced when L cells in the intestine detectfeeding, and it acts as an appetite suppressant (a satiety hormone). UnlikeGLP-1, it increases gut motility, speeding digestion. This gives fats less timeto be absorbed, limiting the number of calories absorbed from the food. However,countering that effect, it slows down the emptying of the stomach, which allowsfor slower and more thorough carbohydrate absorption and prevents high bloodsugar and insulin levels. It increases water absorption in the colon.Consuming protein raises levels of PYY, reducing appetite. This is part of thereason high-protein diets help weight loss. The other reason is thathigh-protein diets help in thermogenesis, the use of energy to generate bodyheat.People with low levels of PYY after a meal feel less satiated and tend to beobese.Peptide YY is similar in form and function to the similar peptides neuropeptideY (NPY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP). Unlike NPY, which stimulates appetite,PYY and PP have the opposite effect, reducing appetite and increasing satiety.Levels of PYY are low in the fasting state but rise quickly after a meal andstay high for an hour or two after eating. Like GLP-1, PYY levels rise longbefore food actually reaches the cells that produce it, indicating that sensorsin the mouth or stomach are signaling for increased PYY early in the meal.Intravenous administration of PYY has been shown to increase fat burning andincrease energy expenditure, showing that these effects also occur in normaldaily responses to meals. Like the other hormones that decrease appetite, PYYalso works in the brain to decrease the reward from eating. Thus, it acts onboth sides of the brain’s obesity circuit—the homeostasis circuit and the rewardcircuit.PANCREATIC POLYPEPTIDE (PP)Image [images/117.jpg]Pancreatic peptide is in the same family of hormones as peptide YY (PYY) andneuropeptide Y (NPY), sharing about half of the amino acids in those molecules.As the name implies, it is produced in the pancreas when we eat and remains atelevated levels for four to six hours afterward. The more we eat, the higher thelevels of PP become.PP decreases hunger (it is a satiety hormone). It is stimulated most by ingestedprotein, moderately by fat, and less so by glucose. This is one of the reasonsprotein and fat are more satisfying than carbohydrates.PP reduces insulin resistance in the liver and has some small effect on insulinlevels, increasing them slightly.The appetite-controlling nature of PP was first discovered while treatingchildren who have the genetic disease Prader-Willi syndrome. These children haveinsatiable hunger and quickly become obese. This hunger is relieved by infusionof pancreatic polypeptide. In some morbidly obese subjects without thissyndrome, low levels of PP and low secretion of PP have been seen (Koska et al.2004). After weight loss, these low levels of PP normalize. This means obesitycauses low levels of PP, and low levels of PP do not cause obesity (Reinehr etal. 2006).Pancreatic polypeptide is an antagonist of another appetite-decreasing hormone,cholecystokinin. Cholecystokinin stimulates pancreatic secretions, andpancreatic polypeptide turns off that stimulation. PP is stimulated by low bloodsugar, eating, or just chewing something without swallowing, thus showing thatthe brain is the cause of the initial release of PP. As food is digested, asecond phase of PP release is stimulated by the food swelling the stomach, andby the food reaching the duodenum. Levels are generally lowest in the morningand peak during the evening. As we age, levels of pancreatic polypeptidegradually rise, quadrupling between the ages of 30 and 70.Pancreatic peptide triggers receptors in the hypothalamus and brain stem todecrease appetite. It also slows down the emptying of the stomach, reduces gallbladder contraction and gut motility, and decreases secretions from thepancreas. It increases activity and movement and increases oxygen consumption.Besides its effects on appetite and digestion, pancreatic polypeptide reducesanxiety by slowing the release of adrenal hormones. These hormones can causeeating disorders such as bingeing and bulimia.GIPImage [images/118.jpg]Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) is secreted in the K cells inthe large intestine and the end of the small intestine. It is another incretin(insulin stimulant), like GLP-1, but it is not as powerful a stimulant ofinsulin release as GLP-1. It is, however, more sensitive to glucose than GLP-1.Like that other incretin, it is rapidly degraded by a special enzyme, so itresponds only to immediate rises in glucose (Gutierrez-Aguilar and Woods 2011).Like GLP-1, GIP is also stimulated by fats in the diet, but it is less sensitiveto fat than GLP-1 is.Mice lacking the receptor for GIP, or lacking the K cells that produce it, areprotected from diet-induced obesity, as GIP is required for fat cells to take upfatty acids and make fat (Seino and Yabe 2013). A high-fat diet causes more Kcells to grow and proliferate and produce more GIP. In turn, GIP stimulates thegrowth of the pancreatic beta cells that produce insulin (Trümper et al. 2009).This is increased when glucose is also present.In people with type 2 diabetes, GIP does not stimulate the release of insulin.Interestingly, this is also true of the relatives of people with type 2diabetes, suggesting that defective GIP signaling plays a part in that disease,and there may be genetic risk factors.Beyond stimulating the release of insulin, GIP makes fat tissues more sensitiveto insulin. In the presence of insulin, GIP causes fat cells to take up more fat(Seino and Yabe 2013). It also increases glucagon secretion when fasting or whenblood sugar is low. (Glucagon raises blood sugar levels.) Thus, it stimulatesinsulin to fix high blood sugar, and glucagon to fix low blood sugar(Christensen et al. 2011).The downside of GIP is not just related to its critical role in the accumulationof fat. It also enhances glucocorticoid hormones that promote inflammation, andthese in turn contribute to obesity. This is slightly balanced by GIP’s actionsin decreasing appetite and food intake (Seino and Yabe 2013). Unlike the similarhormone GLP-1, which reduces gastric emptying, GIP facilitates gastric emptying,allowing ingested carbohydrates to spike insulin levels. This complexinteraction of GIP with glucose and fat metabolism and fat cell regulation makesteasing out its total effect difficult. For example, GIP protects againstdiet-induced obesity and fatty liver disease.Along with GLP-1, GIP protects against Alzheimer’s disease and helps synapticplasticity and memory formation. It is also protective against bone fractures,by interacting with cells called osteoclasts, which mine the bones for calcium(Seino and Yabe 2013). It stimulates bone formation by reducing the death of thebone-building cells called osteoblasts.CHOLECYSTOKININ (CCK)Image [images/119.jpg]Cholecystokinin is another hormone that decreases appetite (Little, Horowitz,and Feinle-Bisset 2005). It is responsible for the digestion of fat and protein.It causes the release of digestive enzymes and bile from the pancreas and thegall bladder. It is released rapidly after a meal in response to fatty acids andsome amino acids in the first part of the small intestine. It is degradedquickly, so it can act as an accurate measure of ingested fat and protein.CCK slows the emptying of the stomach and decreases the amount of acid releasedby the stomach. CCK is inhibited by pancreatic polypeptide (PP), another satietyhormone triggered by protein ingestion.Cholecystokinin stimulates the vagus nerve, which, among many other functions,controls peristalsis, the movement of food through the intestines. Thestimulation of the vagus nerve can be inhibited by capsaicin, the molecule thatmakes hot peppers burn, and this is a key to how capsaicin helps in weightmanagement.Cholecystokinin is produced in the first section of the small intestine, theduodenum, and the section right after that, the jejunum. But it is also widelydistributed in the brain’s hypothalamus, and it is the most abundantneuropeptide in the entire central nervous system. There are two receptors forcholecystokinin, one in the gastrointestinal tract, known as CCKA, and one inthe brain, called CCKB. CCKA seems to be the most important receptor when itcomes to regulating food intake. Drugs that prevent this receptor from working(CCKA antagonists) increase both hunger and meal size in humans (Perry and Wang2012).OXYTOCINImage [images/120.jpg]The hormone oxytocin is usually thought of in the context of social bonding.Positive social interactions cause oxytocin release from the pituitary gland,producing feelings of contentment, calmness and security, and reduced anxiety.Stimulation of the nipples during breast-feeding causes secretion of oxytocin,which causes milk to flow and helps to promote bonding with the baby. Oxytocinis also a powerful stimulant of uterine contractions during childbirth. It hasanti-inflammatory effects and promotes wound healing. It also hascardioprotective effects—it prevents heart disease (Jankowski, Broderick, andGutkowska 2016). In obese subjects, and subjects with diabetes, it has beenfound that oxytocin levels were lower than in normal subjects (Qian et al.2014).But oxytocin has many other effects in the body, and some of them have to dowith energy balance, insulin signaling, and insulin resistance. Nasal sprayadministration of oxytocin has been found to be effective in increasing insulinsensitivity, increasing insulin production, reducing blood triglycerides andcholesterol, and reducing fat mass (H. Zhang et al. 2013). Patients with BMIsover 28 lost an average of 10 pounds in four weeks, and over 19 pounds after 8weeks, with no adverse side effects (24 units of oxytocin nasal spray 4 times aday, 20 minutes before each meal, and before sleeping). LDL cholesterol dropped,and HDL cholesterol rose—exactly what you want to see. One side effect ofoxytocin is decreased food intake. Thus, the weight loss may not be due solelyto improved blood glucose and insulin management.Oxytocin is currently in clinical trials for diseases including autism, anxietydisorder, depression, drug abuse, and schizophrenia. The links between metabolicdiseases and depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia make treatment withoxytocin for obesity and diabetes an interesting research subject.In studies of diet-induced obesity in rats, administering oxytocin reduced bodyweight gain by 50 percent, without changing food intake and without any changein meal patterns. This means the hormone caused a decrease in food efficiency(Deblon et al. 2011). Oxytocin also increased levels of glycerol in the bloodand decreased triglycerides (fat) in the blood. It did this by increasing levelsof enzymes that break fat down into glycerol and free fatty acids, and byincreasing the enzymes involved in fatty acid transport. The levels of freefatty acids in the blood did not rise, indicating they were burned orincorporated into cell membranes. Increasing the dose of oxytocin did reduce thenumber of meals, but not the size of the meals or their duration. The hormonethus increased satiety. The rats also burned fat in preference to carbohydrates,compared to rats given a placebo.Oxytocin induces its own synthesis and release. When oxytocin is injected intorat brains, the rats produce more oxytocin, releasing it into the bloodstream.Fat cells have receptors for oxytocin, and when those are triggered, the fatcells release enzymes that break down fats, and burn the free fatty acids thatresult. The body weight reduction caused by oxytocin is not due to its anorexiceffects (i.e., not from reduced food intake) but by the breakdown of fats in fatcells (Deblon et al. 2011). In the testing on rats, oxytocin increased insulinsensitivity and glucose tolerance, independent of its effects on fat mass.ACETATE, PROPIONATE, BUTYRATEImage [images/122-1.jpg]Image [images/122-2.jpg]Image [images/122-3.jpg]The fatty acids butyric acid and acetic acid have been shown to be protectiveagainst diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance (Lin et al. 2012), even whennot reducing food intake. Propionic acid, on the other hand, has been shown toreduce food intake. Butyrate and propionate, but not acetate, induce guthormones and reduce food intake. (When fatty acids combine with other molecules,they lose a proton and are no longer acids, and we refer to them by the name ofthe remaining part of the molecule.)All three of these short-chain fatty acids are produced by microbes in the humangut, mostly the large intestine, and these microbes are strongly affected bydiet.Butyrate (the four-carbon fatty acid) is the main food source for the cellslining the intestine (enterocytes). Getting enough fiber in the diet helps tostrengthen the gut barrier. This protects us from bacteria and inflammatorymolecules that can otherwise leak through the intestinal lining. But butyratealso acts as a hormone, reducing inflammation, oxidative damage, andtranscription factors that activate inflammatory cytokines. Butyrate gives afeeling of satiety (fullness) after a meal. Butyrate also promotes the formationof regulatory T-cells, immune cells that regulate immune function.Mice fed a high-sugar, high-fat diet become obese and insulin resistant. Addingbutyrate to the diet prevents and reverses insulin resistance.Butyrate increases energy expenditure by modulating the mitochondria, theorganelles inside cells that are responsible for managing energy.Acetate and propionate stimulate production of peptide YY, which speeds up thepassage of food through the intestines, thereby reducing the time it has to beabsorbed. This reduces the amount of energy the body can harvest from a meal.Acetate and propionate also induce secretion of GLP-1, the hormone thatincreases insulin sensitivity and satiety.THYROIDImage [images/123.jpg]ThyroxineThe thyroid gland regulates metabolism and has interactions with insulinresistance, adiponectin, ghrelin, and leptin. Diet restriction (low-caloriediet) reduces thyroid hormone levels, reducing metabolism. Inflammation alsoreduces thyroid levels.The thyroid gland produces three hormones, called triiodothyronine (T3),thyroxine (T4) (shown above), and calcitonin. Calcitonin regulates the levels ofcalcium in the body. T3 and T4 regulate metabolism, and thus we would expectthem to have an influence on energy balance and body composition. They influenceappetite, gut motility, and nutrient absorption.T4 has four iodine atoms, and T3 has three, hence the names. Most of the T3 inthe body is made from T4 by an enzyme that removes one of the iodine atoms. Thehypothalamus releases pulses of a hormone called thyrotropin releasing hormone(TRH), which stimulates the pituitary gland to produce thyroid stimulatinghormone (TSH), which then stimulates the thyroid to produce T3 and T4.Too much thyroid hormone produces a state called hyperthyroidism, which ischaracterized by weight loss and hunger, along with many other symptoms such asanxiety and nervousness. Thyroid hormone affects tissues throughout the body andhas many effects on homeostasis, such as the paradoxical state where theantagonists ghrelin and leptin are both reduced at the same time (Potenza, Via,and Yanagisawa 2009). When patients with hyperthyroid are treated for it, theyoften experience weight gain.Too little thyroid hormone causes the opposite condition, hypothyroidism. Thisstate is characterized by weight gain, along with tiredness and slow heart rate,among several other symptoms. Hypothyroidism can be caused by iodine deficiency(rare, now that most salt is iodized), or by autoimmune disorders, inflammation,and several other problems. It can be treated by adjusting the diet or by takingoral thyroxine pills (synthetic thyroid hormone).If we can cure obesity by taking a thyroid pill, why aren’t doctors handing themout like candy? Because hypothyroidism is only one small part of the obesityepidemic, and thyroid hormone does not cure obesity in people with normalthyroid levels. And, of course, there are side effects.However, while an underperforming thyroid can sometimes cause weight gain,obesity itself can cause thyroid problems. Fat tissue makes many hormones,including some that promote inflammation, and it also harbors immune cellscalled macrophages. When fat cells are overproducing these inflammatorymolecules and immune cells, the result can be autoimmune diseases, where thebody starts attacking itself. Autoimmune attacks on the thyroid gland causehypothyroidism. This in turn exacerbates the obesity problem—another viciouscircle.With the complex set of hormones and enzymes that control the secretion ofthyroid hormone, we would expect to find some natural variation between peoplein how well the system works. Small genetic differences should affect the amountof hormone or enzyme available, and slightly alter how much thyroid hormone isavailable, and how well the receptors for the hormone work. For the most part,these differences are smoothed out by negative feedback control systems, such asproducing more hormone if the receptors aren’t always reacting to it enough.Still, we should see some variation. And a little bit of hypothyroidism, perhapslow but still in the normal range, could add up over the years into a weightproblem (Biondi 2010).Obese people produce more leptin than lean people, and leptin stimulates TRH,which stimulates TSH, thus increasing thyroid hormone levels. TSH, in turn,stimulates leptin secretion from fat cells, in a feedback loop. Leptin alsoraises levels of the enzyme that removes iodine atoms from T4. Thus, leptin andthyroid hormones control one another. Leptin also increases susceptibility tothyroid autoimmunity by regulating immune processes (Biondi 2010).In obese people, levels of TSH are at or near the upper limits of the normalrange, and the higher the BMI, the higher the TSH levels. This may be because ofincreased leptin, but the TSH receptors in fat cells also are less expressedwhen the fat cells are overinflated, and so more hormone may be secreted to makeup for the reduced sensitivity. This last condition is reversed by weight loss,resulting in better thyroid function. With weight loss comes a reduction inleptin, and in TSH, which causes the thyroid to produce less hormone. Becausethis lowers metabolic rate and fat burning, this can make further weight lossmore difficult (Biondi 2010).DOPAMINEImage [images/125.jpg]While the reward system in the brain is very complex, and details are stillbeing worked out, the role of the neurotransmitter dopamine has come to be seenas what makes people want something. It is not the reward itself, or therewarding feeling, but rather the desire for reward that dopamine seems tocreate.Dopamine is often studied in relation to addiction. People with low levels ofdopamine may become addicted as a way of “self-medicating” to bring theirdopamine levels up (Davis et al. 2009). This same mechanism may be involved inobesity, as there are many indications that some forms of obesity are addictivebehaviors involving food and food reward.Dopamine evolved as a way of signaling to the animal that something wasimportant. When we eat something that is highly rewarding (see the section onopiates on page 127 [008_Chapter05.xhtml#page_127]), the brain produces dopamineto make us remember that stimulus. Dopamine makes us want something.At the same time, there is some evidence that high levels of dopamine makepeople more sensitive to reward, and thus more prone to eating for pleasure oreven to binge eating.Cocaine and amphetamines work on the dopamine system by increasing dopaminelevels. These are highly addictive substances. Highly palatable foods full ofsugar, fat, and salt are only a fraction less effective at stimulating dopamineas cocaine. It is easy to see how we can become addicted to these processedfoods. When people refer to their favorite cookie as their particular form ofcrack cocaine, the joke is not all that far from what is actually happening.IRISINImage [images/126.jpg]Irisin is a small protein (made of 112 amino acids) secreted by the muscle cellsduring exercise (Bostrom et al. 2012). It increases beige fat production, andthus thermogenesis (burning fat and glucose to generate body heat). Glucosetolerance is also improved, and fasting insulin levels are reduced. Irisin ispowerful: very tiny amounts have been found to increase fat burning by a factorof 50, and to protect mice from obesity induced by a high-fat diet.The genes for irisin are highly conserved, remaining 100 percent the same inboth mice and humans. Compare this to the 85 percent similarity for insulin, the90 percent similarity for glucagon, and the 83 percent similarity for leptin.This implies that the protein activates a cell surface receptor, since verysmall changes in the activating protein for such receptors result in a failureto activate them. It also speaks to the importance of the molecule in survivaland reproduction.Why should exercise stimulate beige fat thermogenesis? One theory is that sinceshivering is one way the body protects against hypothermia, shivering musclecells get assistance in generating body heat by activating the other mechanismof thermogenesis.Unfortunately, polypeptides (small proteins) like irisin are easily digestedwhen eaten, so the protein would have to be injected in order to be of anybenefit. In the meantime, we can produce our own irisin by exercising (orshivering).The statin drug simvastatin (Zocor) has been shown to increase irisin levels inthe blood. Unfortunately, this may be a side effect of one of its side effects:muscle breakdown. The drug also increases liver problems and blood sugar levels,so it is unlikely to be a popular weight-loss solution.Besides its effects on energy balance, irisin also seems to explain the effectsof exercise in improving brain function and preventing depression, epilepsy,stroke, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s disease (Wrann 2015).White fat cells and bone cells differentiate from the same precursor cells.Irisin prevents these cells from becoming fat cells, and instead promotes theformation of bone cells. This explains in part why exercise is helpful in bonegrowth and maintenance and protects against osteoporosis (Y. Zhang et al. 2016).Irisin also reduces blood cholesterol formed in the liver (Tang et al. 2016).This explains in part the role of exercise in lowering cholesterol levels.ENDOGENOUS OPIOIDSEndogenous opioids are your own brain’s source of heroin and morphine. Thosedrugs act on receptors in the brain that are, in the absence of those drugs, thetargets of natural molecules that are similar to the drugs. These endogenous(originating from within the organism) opioids (molecules similar to opium) arethe molecules that control what we like. This is why they are addicting. Theywork on the part of the brain’s reward system that makes us like something. Youmay know these molecules as endorphins. (There are four types of endorphins,named alpha, beta, gamma, and sigma. The strongest of these is beta endorphin.)Image [images/128.jpg]Beta endorphinWhen we give opioids to animals that are not hungry, they eat. The effect isselective for highly palatable foods. The activation of the brain’s opioidreceptors increases the reward we get from sweet and fatty foods (Davis et al.2009).Animals naturally choose variety in what they eat. This ensures a balance ofnutrients. When we are given one type of food, we tire of it after a while. Butfoods made of sugar, fat, and salt trigger such reward in the brain that wedon’t get tired of them. We keep trying to get that opiate reward. If we blockthe action of opiates in the brain (using drugs developed to treat opiateaddiction), the desire for this high-sugar, high-fat food goes away, since theyno longer provide the reward.It comes as no surprise that the opioid receptors are the target of much studyin the fields of alcoholism and drug addiction.Together, dopamine and opioids form the powerful reward system that processedfoods and drugs like cocaine, amphetamines, heroin, morphine, and alcohol areall produced to exploit for profit. Hijacking the reward system is a veryeffective way to sell products.Besides their reward functions, endogenous opioids also stimulate appetite(Israel et al. 2005).HYPOTHALAMUS AND HORMONESIn the brain’s hypothalamus, several of the hormones act on the appetiteregulation systems in the parts of the hypothalamus called the arcuate nucleusand the paraventricular nucleus. Leptin, insulin, and ghrelin all have receptorsin the arcuate nucleus. Leptin and insulin stimulate production of the precursorprotein POMC, from which alpha- and beta-MSH peptides are formed. The MSHhormones activate the MC4R melanocortin-4 receptor in the paraventricularnucleus, which controls appetite (Pritchard, Turnbull, and White 2002).Image [images/129.jpg]The arcuate nucleus also has receptors for leptin, insulin, and ghrelin thatproduce the antagonists to the MSH hormones. These are NPY and AGRP. While MSHdecreases appetite, NPY and AGRP increase appetite both by acting on the MC4Rreceptor itself and by reducing the expression of MSH elsewhere in the arcuatenucleus. These competing systems maintain a tightly controlled balance forenergy homeostasis, and subtle changes in the genes for any of these signalingmolecules or their receptors can influence the risk of obesity (Pritchard,Turnbull, and White 2002).Other influences on POMC production are CRH, CART, cortisol, and some of theinterleukin-6 family of cytokine messengers. Appetite is a strongly controlledbehavior modifier, and the control system is very complex, with many interactingsystems providing input from many different internal and environmental signals.This means that while there are many ways for the system to go wrong, there areredundancies that minimize the effects of any particular locus of damage.Evolution has had a long time to work on this system.POMC is broken up into a whole raft of smaller peptide hormones by severalenzymes with the help of other proteins to chaperone and ferry the parts towhere they belong. Thyroid hormone also affects how POMC is broken down. Any ofthese enzymes and proteins can have variations that make them less able toperform their function. The result is an increased risk of obesity but with verysmall effects. It is the combination of many of these problems that raises therisk of obesity to levels that express as increased BMI. Most of thesevariations have been found to relate specifically to diet-induced obesity, so anenvironment of highly palatable high-energy foods interacts with genetics toproduce a medically important result (obesity, diabetes, stoke, dementia,metabolic syndrome, etc.).Many of the products produced by breaking up the POMC protein are capable ofinteracting with the MC4R receptor. This means that if something goes wrong withthe production of alpha-MSH, beta-MSH and DA-alpha-MSH (two other breakdownproducts of POMC) can step in. And due to negative feedbacks in the controlsystem, if there is a problem making some hormone, the body detects that thedesired effect is not happening at sufficient levels, and it requests more, thusmaking up for the deficiency. The levels of AGRP can also be adjusted to get thedesired result, since it has the opposite effect as alpha-MSH. So while manythings can go wrong, there are safeguards in place to minimize the damage.NITROSAMINESImage [images/131.jpg]The nitrosamine NDEANitrosamines are small molecules formed when a protein reacts with nitrites ornitrates, either through heat, as in cigarette smoking and frying, or by acids,as when nitrate-containing processed meats are digested in the stomach. Tobaccoprocessing to create chewing tobacco and snuff also creates nitrosamines. Beer,processed meats, and cheeses processed with nitrites are all sources ofnitrosamines. Nitrosamines are also found in cosmetics and pesticides.Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) added to foods helps to prevent the formation ofnitrosamines.Most nitrosamines are carcinogenic. They damage DNA.In one study, early exposure to nitrosamines in rats led to obesity, dementia,diabetes, and metabolic syndrome (Tong, Longato, and Monte 2010) when the ratswere fed a high-fat diet. In another study (Tong et al. 2009), Alzheimer’sdisease, complete with its characteristic beta-amyloid plaques, insulinresistance, fatty liver disease, and diabetes were induced in rats with a singledose of the nitrosamine NDEA (shown above). Since nitrosamines are very commonin processed foods, chronic exposure at a young age may well predispose humansto metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease.SUMMARYThe diagram shown on the next page illustrates the complexity of the system thatregulates appetite, feeding, energy, and homeostasis. Proteins and peptides areshown in rectangular boxes. Those that increase appetite are shown in yellow,and those that decrease appetite are shown in blue. Arrows connecting boxes showwhether a substance increases (green) or decreases (red) the effect of thetarget substance, cell, or receptor.Inputs to the system, such as glucose, fructose, alcohol, vitamins, exercise,stress, fiber, oxytocin, nitrosamines, polyphenols, fatty acids, cold, andsleep, are things we have control over. We also have control over our gutmicrobiome, which produces some of the inputs. Genetic effects, which wegenerally have less control over at this time, are responsible for many of thelevels of these hormones and the effectiveness of their receptors. Knowing ourgenetic contributions to the system can help to guide any of the interventionswe make to control the system.Image [images/132.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"6Image [images/conical.jpg]GUT MICROBESMice are used a lot in science laboratories because, being mammals like us, mostof their biological functions are similar or identical to our own. Their othergreat advantage is their fast breeding rates and inexpensive maintenance costs.In many cases, it is useful to breed the mice in germ-free environments, toreduce variability and eliminate external sources of genetic material and othermolecules. One thing that stands out in germ-free mice is that they are lessprone to diet-induced obesity than normal mice. Germ-free mice given themicrobes from normal mice started to gain considerable fat within 10 to 14 daysdespite the fact that they ate less food (Turnbaugh et al. 2006).Since the mice were nearly identical genetically, and the only difference wasthat some were raised in a germ-free environment, scientists began to look atthe microbes in the guts of the animals to see if there was a link to obesity.The gut microbes were able to break down (ferment) dietary fiber that the micecould not otherwise digest. The resulting simple sugars and short-chain fattyacids were then absorbed by the intestines. Those were then processed in theliver to make fat. Moreover, it appeared that the microbes were producingsignaling molecules that made the mouse fat cells absorb more fats (Turnbaugh etal. 2006).With the discovery of ob/ob mice, scientists had another model for obesity theycould experiment with. These genetically obese mice could not make leptin andate constantly. But it wasn’t just that they ate more food; they also seemed toharvest more energy from that food than otherwise identical lean mice did.Image [images/134-1.jpg]Genetically obese mouse. Wikimedia Commons,https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bioengineered_obese_mouse,_Aberdeen,_Scotland,_1998_Wellcome_L0060083.jpg[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bioengineered_obese_mouse,_Aberdeen,_Scotland,_1998_Wellcome_L0060083.jpg]When scientists analyzed the difference between the gut microbes in obese miceand those in lean mice, it was clear that the obese mice had different gutmicrobes from the lean mice (Ley et al. 2005). Gut bacteria are dominated by twophyla, called the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes.Image [images/134-2.jpg]Taxonomic key (tree of life)The obese mice had half as many Bacteroidetes as the lean mice, and an increaseof the same amount in Firmicutes. Analyzing human gut microbes showed a similarincrease in Firmicutes at the expense of Bacteroidetes. As humans lose weight,this shift reverts back to a more normal distribution.At the time of this study, it was not known whether this difference helped tomake the mice obese, or if it was a result of obesity. But the researchers notedthat feeding antibiotics to cattle increased their growth rate, a commonpractice in the beef industry. Perhaps that growth was spurred by gut microbesthat helped to digest fiber and convert it into short-chain fatty acids, to beabsorbed into the cattle or mouse bloodstream.Another study soon determined that this was indeed the case (Turnbaugh et al.2006). When scientists transferred gut microbes from obese mice and lean miceinto germ-free mice, the mice with the microbes from the obese mice gainedsignificantly more weight than those that got the microbes from the lean mice.This was despite the fact that all the mice ate the same amount of food. Theobese mice were getting more calories out of the same amount of food. The amountcame to an extra 2 percent more calories. In humans, that amount would cause usto gain a pound every three months.That microbes in the human gut can ferment fiber to make sugars and fats thatthe intestines can absorb should not be surprising. After all, we know that incows and other ruminants, microbes break down fiber that the cow cannot digest,and the cows get a substantial portion of their calories from this fermentation.Humans lack the special stomach (rumen) where this happens in the cow, yet westill harbor a substantial colony of microbes in the lower intestine. In fact,our bodies have as many microbial cells as human cells (Sender, Fuchs, and Milo2016). Those bacteria produce vitamins that we cannot (notably vitamin K,vitamin B12, folic acid, biotin, and pantothenic acid), as well as otherimportant molecules. We are a symbiotic organism, host to 200 grams of microbes,mostly in the gut.Image [images/135.jpg]Vitamin K1 (phytomenadione)Giving germ-free mice gut microbes from normal mice causes insulin resistanceand a 60 percent increase in body fat (Bäckhed et al. 2004). Conventionallyraised (normal) mice have 42 percent more total body fat than germ-free mice do,despite the fact that the normal mice eat 29 percent less food than thegerm-free mice.Conventionally raised mice have higher metabolic rates than germ-free mice(Bäckhed et al. 2004). The metabolic rates of germ-free mice were found to be 27percent lower than those of conventionally raised mice. So the fat was beingadded despite less eating and more calorie expenditure.There is a key regulator of fatty acid release from lipoproteins in fat, muscle,and heart cells called LPL (lipoprotein lipase). When LPL levels rise, cellstake up fatty acids, and fat cells grow larger.Image [images/136-1.jpg]Lipoprotein lipase (LPL)In analyzing germ-free and normal mice, it was found that there is a proteincalled fasting-induced adipocyte factor (Fiaf), which inhibits LPL. Since thisprotein inhibits an inhibitor, increasing Fiaf causes fat cells to release theirfatty acids and grow smaller.Image [images/136-2.jpg]Fasting-induced wadipocyte factor (Fiaf)Making matters one step more complicated, the microbes in the mouse gut werefound to cause less Fiaf production, inhibiting the inhibitor of an inhibitor.Mice with microbes can grow their fat cells better than mice without microbes.The fat cells were not increasing in number; they were just getting fatter.Moreover, when fed a diet high in fat and sugars, colonized mice don’t burnfatty acids as well as germ-free mice, due to low Fiaf levels (Bäckhed et al.2004).As the previously germ-free mice gained fat, their levels of leptin roseaccordingly as expected, since fat cells produce leptin. They also becameinsulin resistant (Bäckhed et al. 2004). Their livers produced more fat inresponse to rising glucose and insulin levels. The number of capillaries intheir intestines doubled, to the same amount as normal mice have, allowing themto absorb simple sugars at twice their previous rate.Germ-free mice don’t get as fat as normal mice when fed a “Western” diet, whichis 41 percent fat, 41 percent sugar and other easily digested carbohydrates(e.g., wheat flour), and 18 percent protein. But when they are given microbesfrom normal mice, they become obese on this diet (as do normal mice). When bothgroups of mice ate the same amount of the Western diet, only those with microbesin their gut became obese.In any symbiosis, it is important for the host to control the hosted organisms.Changes in symbiosis that harm the host have a name: dysbiosis. When we eatfoods that change our gut bacteria in nonoptimal ways, the body responds withinflammation, as it would with an infection. The inflammation is at a lowerlevel than with a true infection, but if the bad diet continues, we have chroniclow-level inflammation, which causes obesity, but also worsens nonalcoholicfatty liver disease, which is caused by eating sugar. The inflammation thenencourages the growth of cancer cells, and we get liver cancer (Bourzac 2014).Fat does not dissolve in water. In order to digest and absorb fat, our bodiesproduce a type of detergent that breaks down globules of fat into tiny dropletsthat can be absorbed. This detergent is called bile acid.When the diet is low in fiber and high in fat, the Firmicutes outcompete theBacteroidetes. Among the microbes that bloom are those that digest bile acidinto toxic molecules called secondary bile acids. One of these is deoxycholicacid (DCA). There is always a small amount of DCA in the gut, and it seems tohave little effect in small doses. But it can damage DNA and cause cancer. It isnot only toxic to human cells but also toxic to many of the other microbes inthe gut, the ones that don’t produce DCA. This causes a positive feedback loop,where the increased DCA-producing microbes kill off the others and take theirplace, resulting in more DCA.Image [images/137.jpg]Deoxycholic acid (DCA)The microbes that produce DCA tend to be in the Firmicutes phylum. This explainswhy obese people (and mice) have more Firmicutes and less Bacteroidetes. But italso partially explains how putting microbes from fat mice into germ-free ornormal mice can make them fat. The new microbes are producing toxins that killoff the competition, and they take over, causing inflammation that causesobesity. At the same time, they are better at converting fiber into sugars andfatty acids, so the host gets more calories from a meal.In one study (Ridaura et al. 2013), researchers worked with human twins whereone of the twins was obese and the other was not. They took gut microbes fromeach of them and transplanted them into germ-free mice. The mice that gotmicrobes from the lean twin produced more short-chain fatty acids (fromfermenting fiber). The mice that got microbes from the obese twin had increasedmetabolism of branched-chain amino acids. Branched-chain amino acid (BCAA)metabolites are more commonly found in obese people than in lean people and arecorrelated with insulin resistance (Newgard et al. 2009) when combined with adiet high in fat.When the researchers housed the two mice groups together, all the mice ended upwith the lean-type microbes, indicating that on a normal diet they wouldoutcompete the obese-type microbes. But when fed a low-fiber, high-fat diet, theobese-type microbes won out.In the mice getting microbes from the lean twin, there was extra butyrate andpropionate production, due to the fermentation of dietary fiber, and levels ofsugars were reduced. These mice had a greater ability to break down fiber.Just as fiber can protect against the problems caused by fructose, fiber allowsus to safely eat more fat, by preventing the fat-eating microbes fromoutcompeting the fiber-eating ones.Some 6 percent of the bacteria in the gut are from a single species, Bacteroidesthetaiotaomicron (BT). BT is one of the bacteria that is good at breaking downfiber into simple sugars and short-chain fatty acids. It needs another microbe,Methanobrevibacter smithii (MS), to work most effectively. As its name implies,MS produces methane, the gas that causes embarrassment after eating legumes.This is important, because to produce methane, it consumes carbon dioxide andhydrogen. Since too much hydrogen interferes with BT’s ability to ferment fiber,the combination of the two organisms is more effective than either one alone.When germ-free mice were given just these two organisms, their levels of Fiafdropped, and they gained fat mass and weight. Given just one organism or theother, they did not gain weight (Bäckhed et al. 2004).Note that this weight gain was not obesity—the mice simply gained the sameamount of fat as normal mice. To become obese, they had to be fed the so-calledWestern diet, high in sugar, fat, and easily digested starch. The Western dietis characterized by low levels of fiber, so the contribution to obesity from BTand MS would be expected to be small. Indeed, when mice or people become obese,the Firmicutes bacteria grow in number, while the Bacteroidetes bacteria, likeBT, diminish.Microbes in the gut alter the expression of genes in the host. BT causes thehuman intestine to absorb glucose more effectively. It activates genes to breakdown fats and transport them (Zocco et al. 2007).When there is less diversity in the gut microbes, we see an increase ininflammation. In studies of human obesity, low species-richness people had moreinflammation (Cotillard et al. 2013). People with fewer species were also fatterand had more insulin resistance and higher cholesterol (Chatelier et al. 2013).It was noted that the association between microbial genes and obesity wasgreater than the association between human genes and obesity. More of ourtendency to be fat is explained by our microbe genes than our human genes. (Itwas also noted that this study failed to find an increase in Firmicutes or adecrease in Bacteroidetes in obese subjects compared to lean subjects, unlikeprevious studies.)The shift away from Bacteroidetes and toward Firmicutes was also found instudies of mice fed a diet high in animal fat. Within the Bacteroidetes phylum,the genus Bacteroides was higher in animal fat diets, and the genus Prevotellawas higher in fiber-rich diets (Wu et al. 2011). In a hospital-controlledfeeding study, a shift in diet from high fat, low fiber to low fat, high fibercaused a detectable shift from Bacteroides to Prevotella in a mere 24 hours.This was faster than the transit time of the meals through the body—two to fourdays for the high fiber, and two to seven days for the low fiber (Wu et al.2011). Nevertheless, the complete shift from Bacteroides-dominated toPrevotella-dominated regimes takes longer than 10 days.The fiber-rich diet associated with lean body types produces a gut microbiomewhere Firmicutes is reduced, Bacteroides is reduced, and Prevotella isincreased. The obesity-related Western diet creates a gut where Firmicutes andBacteroides are increased and Prevotella is reduced (Nguyen et al. 2015).Prevotella and Bacteroides are antagonistic—increases in one lead to decreasesin the other. Bacteroides is seen predominating in subjects with a diet high infat and protein. Prevotella is associated with a diet high in plant fiber(Prados 2016).Looking at the genes of gut microbes, we can see some interesting correlationswith aspects of their human hosts. For example, older people have more microbeswith genes that digest starch. As humans age, they become less able to digeststarch on their own. The starch then reaches the gut, where the microbes breakit down (Arumagam et al. 2011). Whether this explains Grandpa’s flatulence wasnot discussed in the paper. More to the point of this book, the host BMIcorrelates strongly with microbe genes that deal with energy metabolism,supporting the link between obesity and the microbiome.Diets high in fiber feed the cells of the intestinal lining. The major source offood for these cells is butyrate, the short-chain fatty acid produced whenmicrobes digest fiber. This strengthens the gut barrier against harmfulinflammatory molecules in the large intestine.When fiber is not available, and the diet contains lots of sugars and fat,harmful microbes outcompete the fiber-digesting microbes. These harmful microbestrigger an immune reaction by the host (you). In order to allow immune cellsthrough the gut barrier to fight these microbes, the host makes the gut barrierleaky. Unfortunately, this can allow the inflammatory molecules to get into thebloodstream, and thus the rest of the body. Now we have systemicinflammation—inflammation throughout the system—which leads to obesity, insulinresistance, and type 2 diabetes (Sanz et al. 2015).The dysbiosis caused by high-sugar and high-fat diets also promotes the growthof bacteria that produce toxic hydrogen sulfide (H2S), the rotten egg–scentedgas. We have enzymes that oxidize this harmful molecule before it can do seriousdamage to blood and brain cells, but they take time to work. In the gut wherethe gas is produced, it can damage beneficial microbes and immune cells, as wellas the cells of the intestinal lining (enterocytes), and help to cause a leakygut. Hydrogen sulfide is produced deliberately by some cells in the body becauseit is a signaling molecule, dilating small capillaries and having someanti-inflammatory effects. But the larger quantities produced during dysbiosisare harmful.Beneficial bacteria found in the gut of lean test subjects include thefollowing: * Bacteroides uniformis (Sanz et al. 2015) * Bacteroides caccae (Sanz et al. 2015) * Bacteroides cellulosilyticus (Sanz et al. 2015) * Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (Vrieze et al. 2013) * Akkermansia muciniphila (Dao et al. 2014) * Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (Vrieze et al. 2013) * Bifidobacterium bifidum (Sanz et al. 2015) * Alistipes finegoldii (Sanz et al. 2015) * Lactobacillus casei (Sanz et al. 2015) * Prevotella copri (Prados 2016; Ley 2016; Kovatcheva-Datchary et al. 2015) * Methanobrevibacter smithii (Goodrich et al. 2014) * Christensenella minuta (Goodrich et al. 2014)Harmful bacteria associated with obesity are: * Staphylococcus aureus (Sanz et al. 2015) * Clostridium leptum (Sanz et al. 2015) * Eubacterium hallii (Sanz et al. 2015) * Escherichia coli (Sanz et al. 2015)The idea of curing microbial diseases in the large intestine by transplantingbacteria from healthy individuals was first tried in 1958 (Eiseman et al. 1958).A disease caused by antibiotic use, pseudomembranous colitis, was a bacterialinfection of the large intestine. It was cured by fecal enemas, which restored ahealthy ecology to the patient’s gut.Recently, with the new understanding of how the gut microbiome affects obesityand diabetes, studies have been done on transplanting fecal matter from healthylean individuals into the gut of obese patients (Vrieze et al. 2012). One studyfound improved insulin resistance in the test subjects after the procedure. Thesuccess of studies like this have led to proposals to select a variety of puremicrobe cultures to encapsulate for oral administration, both to reduce the“ick” factor and to eliminate the risks involved in administering natural“cultures” that might contain unknown harmful species. However, as the ecologyof a healthy gut is quite complex, and some microbes are difficult or impossibleto grow as pure cultures, such artificial colonies may take some time todevelop.Human genetics can affect which bacteria end up colonizing the human gut(Goodrich et al. 2014). In a study of twins in the UK, comparing identical twins(monozygotic, or MZ) to fraternal twins (dizygotic, or DZ), researchers wereable to tease apart the contributions of genetics from those of a sharedenvironment and a shared mother, from whom gut bacteria are transferred atbirth.The microbiomes of the MZ subjects were more similar than those of the DZsubjects. The differences in Bacteroidetes were mostly due to environmentalfactors. This correlates with observations that Bacteroidetes responds well todiet interventions. The differences in Ruminococcaceae (Firmicutes) andLachnospiraceae had the strongest genetic component of heritability.Unsurprisingly, the types that were most affected by genetics proved to be themost stable over time—the environment can change, but genetics typically do not.The family most affected by genetics was Christensenellaceae (a Firmicutes).Forty percent of the difference in this family is due to human genetics. Thisfamily turned out to be a hub of a group of microbe types that occur together,and includes Methanobacteriaceae (an Archaea) and Dehalobacteriaceae (aFirmicutes). When this group of microbes is present, there are fewerBacteroidaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae. This is important because theChristensenellaceae group is associated with low BMI (Goodrich et al. 2014).Other groups of microbes associated with low BMI are Oscillospira andMethanobrevibacter smithii. Interestingly, Christensenellaceae is enriched inomnivorous mammals but not in herbivorous or carnivorous ones.The association of Christensenellaceae with Methanobrevibacter was important forthe association with low BMI. One without the other had less effect than the twotogether (Goodrich et al. 2014). The methanogens produced higher levels of thefatty acids propionate and butyrate than microbiomes lacking methanogens. On theother hand, methanogens were not required to reduce obesity—theChristensenellaceae alone was sufficient to reduce body fat. Merely addingcultures of Christensenella minuta to obese mice caused them to lose weight.Adding the Christensenellaceae remodeled the diversity of the mouse gutmicrobiome, causing rises in Oscillospira. Because Christensenellaceae was stillfound only in low levels, its effects on the rest of the gut microbiome mayindicate that it is a key species, able to have effects beyond its owncontributions (Goodrich et al. 2014).The diversity of the gut microbiome is important. It isn’t just a few good orbad microbe types. They all work together as an ecology. When we create obesemice by feeding them a high-fat, high-sugar, low-fiber diet, the 50 percentreduction in Bacteroidetes and compensating increase in Firmicutes happensmostly through reductions in certain species, leaving the overall diversity muchlower (Ley et al. 2005). A diet of exclusively McDonald’s fast food can cause alarge reduction in diversity, this time by raising Bacteroidetes and loweringFirmicutes, due to the high protein and fat in that diet (Spector 2015). Despitehaving the opposite ratios of the two classes of microbes, this diet also led todysbiosis, obesity, and inflammation.Antibiotics reduce gut microbe diversity, as they kill some microbes more easilythan others. In the absence of antibiotic use, our gut diversity generally growsas we age (Z. Xu and Knight 2015). The more different types of plants we eat,the more our gut diversity grows. Some microbes need food that they can get onlywhen we eat their favorite plants. Eating a wide variety of plants means thatall the microbes get to eat their preferred foods. Modest alcohol use, at thelevel of one drink per week, also raises gut microbe diversity.As we saw with Christensenellaceae, some species can change the ecology for thebetter, while remaining in low percentages themselves. BesidesChristensenellaceae, the yeast Saccharomyces boulardii also improves microbialdiversity in the gut, by providing food for beneficial bacterial species(Everard et al. 2014). There are likely to be many more of these keystonespecies found as we continue to learn more about our symbiotic gut microbes.PROBIOTICSThe human gut has evolved to enable us to be omnivores. The upper gut is almoststerile, like that of a carnivore, adapted to eating fat and meat. The lower gut(the large intestine) teams with bacteria that help us digest fiber andvegetables, similar to the gut of horses and cows. As a species, we are able toeat a diet like that of Yupiks and Inuit in the far north, who live on fat andprotein, or a diet like that of a pure vegan, eating no animal products at all.However, when we learned to farm and to cook food, our diet changed. New foodsthat require cooking, such as grains, legumes, and root vegetables, came intoour diet. These foods need to be cooked in order for us to digest them. Tryeating a dried bean or a raw potato or a mouthful of wheat kernels. Cooking andfarming were great inventions that allowed humans to access much more food andto expand to cover the planet.Unfortunately, these new foods are full of starches that can be fermented in thenormally sterile upper gut. The stomach, which is acidic to digest protein,usually kills the bacteria that are sensitive to acid. The next organ in thedigestive process, the duodenum, is alkaline, and kills bacteria that aresensitive to alkali. Bile salts are toxic to most microbes, and they are addedin this phase of digestion. Adding a lot of cooked starches and sugars allowsbacteria to colonize farther down in the small intestine, where they can causeinflammation and allergic reactions.The large intestine is where anaerobic bacteria—bacteria that die in thepresence of oxygen—such as Bacteroides can thrive. These bacteria ferment thefiber and resistant starch that the human digestive system can’t handle. Theyproduce the short-chain fatty acids that are needed by the cells in theintestinal wall, and they contribute as much as 500 extra daily calories to thediet. The fermentation also produces heat to warm our bodies.Probiotics are cultures of bacteria known to be beneficial to humans. They donot necessarily have weight loss or weight maintenance as their primaryfunction, but they aid in gut microbiome health.Many fermented foods are excellent probiotics. Yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut,pickles, natto, kombucha, kimchi, tempeh, and lassi are some examples. Yogurtthat contains sugar or fruit is not effective, as the sugar inhibits the growthof the bacteria.While natural fermented foods are great, there are drawbacks. Many of thebacteria cannot survive the trip through the digestive system. The acidicstomach and the alkaline duodenum are both detrimental to most bacteria (this isgenerally a good thing, as many bacteria are harmful). Also, the fermented foodsare limited in how many bacteria are available. Concentrated dried cultures ofprobiotic bacteria in capsule form overcome these limitations—they can contain50 or more times as many bacteria, and they come encapsulated in protectivecoatings that can survive until they reach the large intestine. The drawback isthat they generally contain only a few of the beneficial species we want tocultivate.Some typical species found in probiotic formulas: * Bifidobacterium bifidum * Bifidobacterium lactis * Bifidobacterium longum * Bifidobacterium breve (Coakley et al. 2002) * Lactobacillus plantarum (Vrieze et al. 2013) * Lactobacillus casei (Vrieze et al. 2013) * Lactobacillus acidophilus (Vrieze et al. 2013) * Lactobacillus gasseri * Lactobacillus salivarius * Lactobacillus rhamnosus * Lactobacillus bulgaricus * Lactobacillus paracasei * Saccharomyces boulardii BiocodexBifidobacterium bifidum produces acetic acid, which, as we have seen, is a fattyacid with important effects in metabolism and satiety. It also converts linoleicacid (LA) into conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) (Coakley et al. 2002), which hasmany health benefits including weight loss (see the section on dietary fat).Bifidobacterium breve and Bifidobacterium dentium have been found to be the bestat this conversion. Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum is also a good producer ofCLA (Raimondi et al. 2016).Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus curvatus have been shown to reduceweight gain in mice fed a high-sugar, high-fat diet (Yoo et al. 2013). Fataccumulation both in fat tissue and in the liver were significantly reduced,especially when both species were present. The study points out that multistrainprobiotics are more beneficial than single-strain probiotics.Lactobacillus gasseri reduced abdominal fat and subcutaneous fat by almost 5percent in adult obese human subjects in a randomized control trial (Kadooka etal. 2010). Taken in the form of milk fermented with the bacterium (yogurt), italso reduced cholesterol levels.Another plant-derived lactic acid bacterium, Pediococcus pentosaceus, was alsofound to be effective in preventing obesity in mice fed a high-fat diet (X. Zhaoet al. 2012). Fat deposits in the liver were also reduced. Similar results werefound with the bacterium Bacteroides uniformis (Cano et al. 2012).Saccharomyces boulardii is one of the few yeasts known to be a probioticassociated with reduced body fat, liver fat, and inflammation (Everard et al.2014). It may work more through changing the gut ecology and promoting the otherantiobesity microbes than through specific actions on its own. Unlike otheryeasts, it prefers body temperature, can withstand the acidic environment of thestomach, and is resistant to bile acids. These features allow oral doses tosurvive until they can colonize the large intestine. Oral dosages of S.boulardii raise Bacteroidetes by 37 percent, and decreased Firmicutes by 30percent compared to controls. No changes in food intake were seen, despite adrop in weight and total fat mass of 10 percent. Markers of inflammation droppedby 40 to 50 percent.You may have noticed that the common strains found in probiotic capsules arelimited to only Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. These are easy-to-culture,gram-positive, anaerobic bacteria. Finding a probiotic that has Bacteroides orPediococcus will probably be difficult. To increase these strains in your gut,you will want to turn to prebiotics to enhance the numbers that already existthere.PREBIOTICSA prebiotic is a fiber that feeds gut microbes. Certain types of fiber are knownto promote the growth of the kind of gut microbes that are beneficial for weightcontrol, insulin sensitivity, and reducing metabolic syndrome. They are betterat preventing obesity than at curing it, but combined with successfulweight-loss efforts, they will help prevent regaining the weight. Because theyare fiber, they are filling and kill appetite, making dieting easier.High-sugar, high-fat diets change the gut microbiome, specifically by reducingBifidobacteria (Vrieze et al. 2013). Supplementing the diet with the fiberoligofructose was found to completely restore levels of Bifidobacteria, leadingto improved glucose tolerance, increased satiety, and weight loss. The poor diethad increased the levels of bacteria that contain lipopolysaccharides, whichcause inflammation. (The name of the molecule tells us that it is a mixture offatty acids and chains of sugars.) Lipopolysaccharides form part of the cellwall of certain bacteria and are called endotoxins, toxins that are releasedonly when the bacterial wall is broken. Endotoxins provoke a strong responsefrom the human immune system, causing inflammation, fever, and diarrhea, andsometimes potentially fatal septic shock.Eating a low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet, often recommended for weight loss,has harmful effects on gut bacteria (Duncan et al. 2006), due to the lack offood for the microbes. This reduces the proportion of important Bacteroidesspecies and Roseburia, both of which are important for weight management. A dietthat includes fiber and resistant starch can keep these beneficial strains ingood health while still reducing the levels of digestible carbohydrates.Oligofructose is a molecule made up of 10 or fewer fructose molecules joinedtogether. It is not digested by humans, so the fructose does no harm.Nevertheless, it tastes somewhat sweet—a third to half as sweet as sugar—and isused in some syrups as a noncaloric sweetener. Commercially processedoligofructose powder normally contains 6 to 10 percent sugars: glucose,fructose, and sucrose. Specially purified versions with longer chains of 25 to60 fructose molecules do not taste sweet, have no sugars, and are used asfat-mimicking fiber additives to some processed food.Natural sources of inulin, the longer chain version of oligofructose, arejicama, Jerusalem artichokes (also known as sunchokes), chicory root, burdockroot, dandelion root, salsify root, and yacon root.Less concentrated sources of inulin are asparagus, leeks, onions, garlic,plantain, and bananas.If your body has not been getting lots of fiber, and you have the microbiome ofan obese person, it might take a little while to grow the lean-type microbes inyour gut. Taking in too much inulin or oligofructose before your gut microbiomehas been conditioned can cause uncomfortable gas and bloating. Slowly increasethe amounts of inulin in your diet and back off a little if you feel too gassy.Over time you will grow a new microbial garden that handles the inulinperfectly.ANTIBIOTICSAntibiotics are generally not very specific in which microbes they kill. Thismeans that in the human gut, they kill the beneficial microbes as well as anyharmful ones. As a consequence, they can alter the state of the microbialecology in the gut in ways that affect metabolism and obesity.If you have obese-type microbes, you might see improved glucose tolerance andinsulin sensitivity after a dose of antibiotics. The effect will be short livedif your diet does not change to favor lean-type microbes.Antibiotics may also help obese patients by reducing low-grade inflammation.Again, since this is caused by the microbes that thrive in a high-sugar,high-fat, low-fiber diet, the effect will not be sustained unless the dietchanges to a higher-fiber, lower-fat, low-sugar diet. Antibiotics reducelipopolysaccharides, since those are produced by harmful bacteria. This reducesinflammation and reduces the harmful metabolic effects of lipopolysaccharides.Antibiotics also reduce short-chain fatty acids in the large intestine, sincethese are produced by beneficial microbes. This can result in fewer caloriesbeing absorbed in that organ.Various microbes have different tolerances for different antibiotics. This isalmost guaranteed to cause problems in the gut by upsetting the ecology of thegut and reducing the diversity of the microbiome. As we have seen, a lessdiverse microbiome leads to obesity, and many microbes require the assistance ofother species of microbe in order to thrive.The rapid rise of the obesity epidemic since the 1970s may be caused in part byincreased use of antibiotics. The reduced diversity of the gut microbiome leadsto higher inflammation, insulin resistance, and higher blood lipids andcholesterol.If you must take antibiotics for some condition, take them along with probioticsand prebiotics that help the beneficial microbes withstand the antibiotic andrecover faster once the antibiotic is discontinued. This will help to create theproper gut ecology, one that does not promote obesity."},{"pageContent":"7Image [images/conical.jpg]GENETICSAs we have seen in the section on hormones, there are lots of “moving parts” tothe obesity problem. All those hormones and neurotransmitters, and theirreceptors, are produced according to genetic instructions in your DNA. We knowthat genes are inherently variable—without variation, there can be no evolution.Some variants of genes work better than others. If you think about what a randommutation is, you can see that it is unlikely to improve on something that hashad millions of years of selection pressure to create. It is like throwing arock at a running car engine and hoping for an improvement. Most likely, theengine won’t run quite as well afterward.We know we can’t blame genetics for the obesity crisis, because our genes didnot change all of a sudden in the late 1970s, when we all started getting fat.On the other hand, we all share the same food-rich environment, and yet some ofus are fat, while others are less so, or lean. That variation may well be due togenetic effects, since we know that obesity is heritable—fat runs in families.Somewhere between 40 and 70 percent of people’s BMI can be blamed on theirparents’ genes, although some papers claim 50 to 90 percent (Barsh, Farooqi, andO’Rahilly 2000). Adopted children have BMIs that correlate more with their birthparents than with their adoptive parents. When sets of twins are overfed, theweight gain is similar in the identical twins but differs in fraternal pairs(Ramachandrappa and Farooqi 2011).If something goes wrong genetically with the complex systems that maintain yourbody fat balance, we can sometimes see dramatic effects. Scientists studymorbidly obese people—100 pounds above ideal weight, BMI over 40, significantmedical problems due to obesity—to see if there is a genetic cause for theseoutliers. This is how we learn a lot about the genetics of obesity—by studyingthe extremes.But there are far more examples of subtle variations. These don’t automaticallymake a person destined to be 600 pounds. They just make a person more likely togain weight than someone without that variation. There are many hormones andenzymes and receptors involved in energy balance that, combined with naturalvariation in all genes, allow for thousands of tiny effects. It is these effectsas a whole that combine to give a probability of becoming overweight or obesegiven a food-rich environment and a food-obsessed social setting.HEDONIC EATINGAn example is what we call hedonic eating. Eating for pleasure. We all do it.But some people with particular variations in the genes for the brain messengermolecules dopamine and opioids get more pleasure from food than other people do.In studies of binge-eating disorders, it was found that two genes in particular(called DRD2 and OPRM1) had what is called gain-of-function variations in somepeople, and loss-of-function variations in others. The people who hadgain-of-function in both genes were prone to binge eating. The people withloss-of-function in both genes were less likely to be in the binge-eating group(Davis et al. 2009).This does not mean that these people are destined to be obese. It just meansthat they are more likely to overindulge when foods rich in sugar, salt, and fatare around. They can avoid situations like that, or fight the temptations, oncethey know what their triggers are.The OPRM1 gene codes for a receptor for opioids. Gain-of-function variations inthat gene have been tied to the reward baby monkeys get from attachment to theirmothers, to increased alcohol stimulation in humans, and to a greater tendencytoward drug use and abuse.On the other end of the spectrum, the dopamine receptor gene DRD2 leads toobesity by a different mechanism. Obese people who are not binge eaters tend tohave a loss-of-function variation in this gene. They are less able to experiencenatural reward. This is linked to alcoholism and gambling, where those with thisvariation seek more stimulation to make up for the lack of reward. Eating lotsof highly palatable foods full of sugar and fat is another way to self-medicateto get more reward.INFLAMMATIONYour genetic makeup can make you more prone to inflammation, which can lead toobesity. Mutations in genes relating to TNF-alpha and IL-6 (G-308A and C-124G)in obese patients with impaired glucose tolerance carry twice the risk of type 2diabetes (Dandona, Aljada, and Bandyopadhyay 2004).CARBOHYDRATESThe DioGenes large-scale randomized controlled test (Astrup, Raben, and Geiker2015) studied high-protein, low glycemic load diets and reported that a geneticvariant in the gene rs987237 was strongly associated with how well the diethelped. Sixty-seven percent of the subjects had the AA variant and did well onthe high-protein, low glycemic load diet. The other third of the subjects, witheither the AG or the GG variants, saw no differences in weight whether they wereon the high-protein, low glycemic load or the normal-protein, high glycemic loaddiets. The G variant is associated with obesity, and having it on one half orboth halves of the DNA strand was enough to lose the benefit of the high-proteindiet. If you are in the unlucky one-third, the Atkins and other low-carbohydratediets will have less effect on you.THE OB GENEDefects in the famous ob gene, so named because it causes obesity in mice, arerare in mice and also quite rare in humans (Carlsson et al. 1997). But if bothcopies of the gene are damaged, uncontrolled feeding occurs, since the leptinreceptor no longer works and the unfortunate animal (or person) is alwayshungry. Up to 3 percent of patients with severe obesity have loss-of-functiondefects in the LEP gene, which codes for leptin (Ramachandrappa and Farooqi2011). These leptin-deficient individuals also have impaired fat burning,further exacerbating their condition. Worse yet, leptin is needed for properthyroid function, and thyroid hormone controls metabolic rate.THE FTO GENEIn a wonderful study of the genetics of obesity (Claussnitzer et al. 2015),researchers looked into the area of the genome that harbors the strongestassociation with obesity, an area known as the FTO region. FTO stands for “FaTmass and Obesity-associated,” and the region resides on chromosome 16.It turns out there are several variations in the FTO area that have an effect onobesity and energy balance. Some affect the hypothalamus and influence snacking.But the region in this particular study, called rs1421085, determines whether ornot an adipocyte progenitor cell turns into beige fat, which burns energy tocreate body heat, or white fat, which stores triglycerides. The study looked atwhat is called a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, pronounced snip), whereone of the DNA bases is changed from a thymine (T) into a cytosine (C).This region is a regulatory gene (one that controls other genes, rather thancoding for a protein). Moreover, the gene it regulates is yet another regulatorygene, ARID5B, which in turn regulates two genes, IRX3 and IRX5, that finally docode for proteins.IRX3 and IRX5 are genes that make the adipocyte progenitor cell turn into awhite fat cell. ARID5B turns those genes on (“upregulates” them). The rs1421085SNP downregulates this enhancer. When the T is changed to a C, this inhibitingfunction is lost, and the ARID5B gene tells the progenitor cells to all turninto white fat cells instead of heat-producing beige fat cells.Without enough beige fat, less energy goes into generating heat, and there aremore white fat cells to take up that unburned fuel and store it. People with theworking form of the gene are protected from much diet-induced obesity.This SNP accounts for 1 percent of the variance in BMI in the population, and 22percent of the population-attributable risk of obesity. This means that thereare plenty of people with the mutation who are not obese or overweight, butamong people who are obese, this SNP accounts for over a fifth of thelikelihood.The rs1421085 SNP is both widespread and has strong effects on those carryingthe variation. In Europeans, 44 percent of the population carry the variant. InAfrican populations, only 5 percent carry it. This suggests that either it wasselected for (has some survival advantage) in European populations, or thatthere was a genetic bottleneck, where by chance only those with this variantsurvived. The T variant—the version that works—is strongly conserved, meaningthat it occurs in animals ranging from mice and rats to horses and cattle,indicating that it is very important for survival. In humans, it may not havebeen as important once we invented clothing and discovered fire, since itseffect is to keep us warm. The shift from energy-dissipating tissue (beige fat)to energy-storing tissue may thus reflect that energy storage was more importantfor European populations in the distant past than thermogenesis.The SNPs in the FTO region are usually coinherited, so any one person might haveseveral obesity-related SNPs that combine to make it more likely that they willbecome obese in our new environment of highly available obesogenic foods.We saw in the section on hormones that many different systems have effects onobesity. Cortisol, the stress hormone, and CRH (corticotropin-releasing hormone)link stress to obesity. MCH (melanin-concentrating hormone) and alpha-MSH(alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone) link sleep and pigmentation to obesity.Endogenous opioids (endorphins and enkephalins) link obesity to the rewardsystems in the brain.It turns out that all these hormones are produced by splitting up a singleprotein produced primarily by the pituitary gland. This protein is calledpre-pro-opiomelanocortin (pre-POMC). As the name implies, this protein controlsthe opioid, melanin, and corticotropin hormones, as well as the lipotropins,hormones that promote the release of fat from the liver into the blood. Theprotein is also produced in the brain’s hypothalamus, in the immune system, andin the skin (remember it is the source of hormones that control pigmentation)(Pritchard, Turnbull, and White 2002).It is no surprise then that defects in the gene that codes for the POMC proteincan result in obesity. In the general case of POMC deficiency, where the wholeprotein is missing or very short, not enough adrenal hormones are produced, theappetite-depressing hormone alpha-MSH is not produced, and the melanin hormonesare not produced. Babies with this defect have light skin and red hair, areravenously hungry, and experience frequent periods of low blood sugar (sometimesleading to seizures), elevated levels of toxic bilirubin in the blood, andproblems producing the bile acids that allow fats to be digested. The good newsis that only about 50 cases have ever been described. This is not surprising, asthis protein is vital to survival, and evolution would quickly weed out carriersof the defect if the defect occurs in both copies of the gene, one from themother and one from the father.People who have one working copy of the gene produce less of the POMC proteinand have an increased risk of obesity as well as other problems. About 2 percentof all severe early-onset obesity is caused by having only one working POMCgene.The POMC gene is also what is known as a quantitative trait locus (QTL) forobesity. This means that slight changes in it affect many other systems thatslightly increase the odds of being obese. Small changes in the POMC region arelinked to low leptin levels in the blood, thus decreasing the appetitesuppression that leptin provides.Other SNPs in the FTO gene, which some people call the fat gene or the fatsogene, are rs9939609 (linked to type 2 diabetes), rs7193144, rs9940128, andrs1121980 (early-onset obesity), rs9939973 (obesity), rs8050136, rs10938397, andrs2815752 (diabetes and obesity), rs7498665, rs4752856, rs17782313 (high BMI,more snacking). Note that some of these variations affect beige fat and fatburning, without appetite changes, while others (like rs17782313) affectappetite and feeding frequency (snacking).THE TUB GENEAnother gene with a cutesy name is TUB (or “tubby”). There are three SNPs inthat gene that are of interest with respect to obesity.The SNP rs1528133 is associated with diabetes and high BMI and appears to affectcarbohydrate metabolism. People with the AA type are considered “normal.” Peoplewith the AC or CC variants have higher BMI numbers than the AA people do.The SNP rs2272382 affects fat metabolism. People with the AA or AG variant getmore energy from saturated fat and monounsaturated fat than those with the GGvariant. The AA and AG types also tend to eat more sugar (Vliet-Ostaptchouk etal. 2008). The SNP rs2272383 was similar to rs2272382, but with a weaker effect.If you have any of these risk types, you are prone to eating more sugar. Knowingthat this is a risk factor for you might help you to cut down on or eliminatesugars from your diet. Of course, as we have seen, eliminating sugar isbeneficial to all genotypes, not just those genetically predisposed to overdoingit. When diets turned away from fat and toward more carbohydrate (especiallysugars) in the late 1970s, people with nonfunctional TUB genes were likely to beaffected more than others.THE MC4R GENEThe alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) produced from POMC acts onone of the five known melanocortin receptors in the brain, called MC4R(melanocortin-4 receptor). This receptor is specific for appetite and feedingbehavior. Mice with the MC4R receptor gene knocked out are constantly eating andbecome quite obese. One form of morbid human obesity has been shown to be causedby a mutation in this gene (Vaisse et al. 1998). Mutations in this one gene arethe most common obesity mutations known so far. Even people with one workingcopy (heterozygous) of the gene have increased risk of obesity. There are almost200 variations of this gene in different populations—Asian, North American,European—and it accounts for 2 to 3 percent of all genetic obesity.Mutations in the MC4R gene cause hyperphagia (eating a lot) in children, andthis decreases with age. The metabolic rate is unaffected. The receptor is alsoexpressed in bone cells, and the obesity-related mutations cause bone toaccumulate more than normal, with less bone being mined for minerals likecalcium. Thus, these mutations make the bones heavier. While the mutationsincrease appetite and obesity, they do not predispose carriers to diabetes likeother forms of obesity, and they lower blood pressure.Depending on which MC4R mutation a person has, the effect can range from aslight reduction in receptor activity to a complete lack of activity. It ispossible to have both copies of the gene nonfunctional, which always leads toearly-onset obesity, but this is rare. Also rare, but with very high risk ofobesity, is to have one reduced-function mutation from one parent and anotherfrom the other. With one functional copy and one reduced-function copy, the riskof obesity can range from slight to quite high.People with reduced MC4R activity benefit more from exercise than people who areobese for other reasons, possibly due to the exercise-produced hormone irisinand its effects on tipping progenitor cells into becoming bone instead of fat,and its effects on raising thermogenesis (production of body heat). People withthese mutations in both copies of the gene respond less well to bariatricsurgery than those with other forms of obesity or with only one damaged copy.A study where normal subjects without MC4R mutations were given twice-dailynasal spray containing the alpha-MSH hormone for six weeks showed an averageloss of body fat of 3.7 pounds, or a little over half a pound per week (Fehm etal. 2001). Insulin levels dropped by 20 percent and leptin dropped by 24percent, without increasing appetite.Another melanocortin receptor, MC3R, is also associated with obesity, butwithout increasing appetite. The effects of defects in this gene on obesity aresmall, however, and only add a little extra risk of becoming obese. Tiny effectslike this, spread throughout the genome, are what make genetic obesity sodifficult to piece out. All of us have hundreds of small differences in keyenergy-balance genes, and each one contributes just a little bit of risk.Mice with nonfunctional MC3R receptors have increased fat mass and decreasedlean mass and get more calories from their food than their normal littermates.They eat less and have normal metabolic rates, but they gain fat nonetheless.The hormone adiponectin is another obesity-related molecule. Adiponectin levelsare controlled by genes that have variants that affect obesity. Low adiponectinlevels are associated with metabolic syndrome: obesity, diabetes, etc.Loss-of-function variants in the genes that code for the hormone or itsreceptors increase the risk of high BMI and problems in glucose metabolism.Another molecule, apolipoproteins, are the proteins that bind to fat andcholesterol so they can be soluble in water and carried through the bloodstream.They act like detergents, with one side that is attracted to water and anotherside that is attracted to fats. Variations in the genes that code for themaffect heart disease risk and whether saturated fat leads to obesity. Two genes,APOA2 and APOA5, have variants that are simultaneously linked to obesity and tolower risk of cardiovascular disease.One important thing to note about genetic causes of obesity: they are not aguarantee that you will be obese. There are many carriers of each of these genesthat are not overweight or obese. And no single gene is found in more than 3 to5 percent of all people with BMI over 40. Before 1980, obesity was an unusualsight. We have changed our environment in ways that combine with preexistinggenetic variants to cause us to gain weight. While we cannot yet do much aboutour genetics, we have a lot of control over our environment.SUMMARYThe following table shows a list of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) thathave links to obesity, BMI, or diabetes. If you have the data from a geneticsscreen, such as from 23andMe, you can look up the SNP name in your data to seeif you have the normal allele or the risk allele. If you wish to know more aboutany particular SNP, you can search for the SNP name (e.g., rs17782313) on theInternet and generally get quite a lot of information, including scientificpapers that studied that SNP or gene.Image [images/160.jpg]Image [images/161.jpg]Image [images/162.jpg]Image [images/163.jpg]Image [images/164.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"8Image [images/conical.jpg]ENVIRONMENTAlthough genetics plays a role in obesity, it acts more like a multiplier ofenvironmental effects than as the main cause. In an environment that is full ofsugary, fatty, salty foods, everyone gains weight. But those with genetictendencies toward imbalance get fatter sooner. If both types of people are fed adiet that is more natural, without sugar, wheat flour, and processed foods, eventhose with obese-type genes won’t have problems.In a large study of 20,000 Scottish families, genetic factors (identified usingboth gene sequencing and pedigree) accounted for only half of traits relating toobesity and heart health (Xia et al. 2016). What the study called“recently-shared environment of couples” accounted for approximately 11 percentof the differences. It seems that whom you marry accounts for a significantproportion of your problem, or lack of one. It also means that if your spousehas a weight problem, you might be it.Environment is not just the foods you bring home or the people you live with.Dieting at a party is difficult for several reasons. First, the host wants toplease everyone, so the foods are there not to fend off hunger but to stimulateeating for pleasure and reward. They are sweet, rich, and often salty. Theytrigger the opiate receptors in our brains, and the sight of them stimulates thedopamine that makes us want the food.Second, there is usually a large variety of foods. We have evolved to desirevariety, since it helps to get all the different types of nutrients we need.Given a single type of food, we will eat it for a while and then tire of it.Given a variety, we will keep eating, trying one food after another. If thefoods are all mixtures of cheap sugar, salt, and fat, we won’t get thenutrients, but our brain doesn’t know that.Third, there are lots of other people eating. Seeing others eat makes us want toeat. It doesn’t help that there are a bunch of people at the party telling us weabsolutely must try the cheesecake, or that they brought their favorite newdessert and you will just die if you don’t get a slice.Fourth, when we are in a place where there are lots of people and lots of food,we will mindlessly keep eating, not paying any attention to whether we arehungry or stuffed to the gills. We talk, and we reach for a snack in betweenbreaths.In a restaurant, dieting is difficult for many of those reasons, but also for afew more. Restaurants know that people associate large portions with gettingtheir money’s worth. They serve a whole day’s worth of calories on one plate. Aslong as the food is there in front of us, and we are enjoying the company andthe conversation, we will mindlessly clean our plates and complain afterwardabout the bloated feeling we have in our stomachs. Instead of eating less, webuy drugs that reduce stomach acid, thinking that heartburn is just something weare prone to getting when we eat, not a signal that we have overindulged.At work, there may be pastries or doughnuts at meetings, candy at the receptiondesk, or a vending machine in the hallway. Lunches may be in the companycafeteria or at a restaurant, where variety and processed dessert foods conspireto defeat our willpower.At the supermarket, the processed foods take up nearly the whole store. Theproduce, meat, and dairy sections are all on the periphery. Inside is row afterrow of foods made of wheat starch, sugar, cheap processed vegetable oils, andsalt.On the drive home are many fast food restaurants and ministores beckoning us in.Just the sight of them stimulates our cravings and raises insulin levels. Whatsugar there was in our blood is diverted to fat. The low blood sugar thatresults makes us hungry. And it is so easy to just stop in and get a milkshakeor a box of cookies and a Big Gulp.At home, we are more in control of our environment, at least if we live alone.Living alone, we can just decide not to bring home foods we know we should notbe eating. Living with others, we are presented with whatever unhealthyprocessed addictive foods someone else may have brought in. Or they may insistthat we buy the sugared cereals, the desserts, the chips, and the snacks, andmake life miserable if we don’t.At home watching television, we are again barraged with advertising carefullydesigned to make us want food. We may have just finished dinner, but thecarefully tested commercials generate desire, and we get up and get a bowl ofice cream to watch with the show, even though we had pushed away from the tabletoo full to eat another bite just a few minutes ago.Another environmental variable is temperature. We tend to keep our buildings ata comfortable temperature and spend most of our time indoors. Exposure to cooltemperatures (60°F) triggers brown and beige fat to burn fatty acids and glucoseto keep us warm.INFLAMMATIONInflammation is a key part of the body’s innate immune system. When cells areattacked by pathogens or irritants, or when cells are damaged, the body engagesa protective response. Immune cells are mobilized, and the blood vessels in theaffected area enlarge (vasodilation). The result is reddening, warming, andswelling, usually associated with some pain. The reddening and warming are whatgive inflammation its name, from the Latin for “burning.” There are many namesfor problems involving inflammation, and we give the suffix -itis to them.Examples of inflammatory problems are arthritis, tonsillitis, urethritis,diverticulitis, vasculitis, laryngitis, and so on.Acute inflammation is easy to spot. A bee sting, a mosquito bite, or a splintercauses pain, redness, and swelling in the area affected. Chronic (prolonged)inflammation can affect blood vessels and internal organs, and can be moredifficult to notice. This chronic systemic inflammation is what is associatedwith obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. It is usually diagnosed based onblood tests for specific proteins associated with inflammation, such asC-reactive protein, interleukins, serum amyloids, and tumor necrosis factoralpha (TNF-alpha). Of particular interest to obesity are interactions withinsulin, blood glucose, and the satiety hormone leptin.Chronic systemic inflammation is what is associated with obesity and its relateddiseases (J. Kang et al. 2010). Inflammation can cause obesity, and obesitycauses inflammation, in a deadly cycle. Eliminating either obesity orinflammation can help eliminate the other.Obesity is a state of chronic inflammation (Dandona, Aljada, and Bandyopadhyay2004). We can predict future obesity and diabetes risk by looking forinflammatory mediators (TNF-alpha and interleukin-6) in a blood sample. Thesemolecules in the blood can interfere with insulin action, causing insulinresistance. This, in turn, reduces insulin’s anti-inflammatory effects,resulting in even more inflammation. The inflammatory hormone TNF-alpha isproduced by fat cells and impairs insulin signaling, causing insulin resistance(J. Kang et al. 2010). The more adipocytes (fat cells) we have, the moreTNF-alpha we produce, and the more insulin resistant we become.Fat cells, called adipocytes by doctors and scientists, are not just storagebags for energy. They are hardworking factories of over 50 different hormones(called adipokines) that affect the cells themselves, cells in the rest of thefat tissue (adipose tissue), and cells throughout the body when they aresecreted into the bloodstream. The two most studied adipokines are leptin andadiponectin (Greenberg and Obin 2006).Adiponectin increases sensitivity to insulin in muscles and the liver. Itincreases the burning of fatty acids in several tissues, such as muscle cells.This results in fewer fatty acids found in the blood. Adiponectin reduces theamount of glucose in the blood, again by burning it (compare this to insulin,which reduces glucose and fatty acids by storing them in fat cells). It burnsglucose and fatty acids by activating the enzyme AMPK. This is the same enzymeactivated by exercise, and this is why exercise increases insulin sensitivityand burns fatty acids.You would think that as people get fatter, more adiponectin would be produced,since it is produced in fat cells. But actually, the opposite happens. As arule, when we gain weight, we don’t create new fat cells. We fill up theexisting fat cells. They grow as they fill with triglycerides. As they distend,they become less effective at producing adiponectin.As we get fatter, we produce less adiponectin. This causes us to become lesssensitive to insulin and more prone to high blood sugar. These are the hallmarksof metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Low adiponectin also causesatherosclerosis through mechanisms involving adhesion molecules and thetransformation of macrophages (immune cells) into foam cells that clog arteries.Many people who are trying to lose weight are doing so to prevent heart disease.Reducing body fat percentage reduces the inflammation that causes hardening ofthe arteries.The other well-studied adipokine produced by fat cells is leptin. Unlike whathappens with adiponectin, leptin levels grow along with the fat cells. It is,after all, a signal that the fat cells are full and that we should stop eating.It normally does stop us from feeling hungry. However, many of us eat forpleasure or eat mindlessly or out of boredom, long after we are no longerhungry. The fat cells fill up and produce even more leptin, which we continue toignore. Eventually, the leptin levels are so high that the cells receiving thesignal start to ignore it. We become insensitive to leptin. When we areinsensitive to leptin, we are hungry all the time.Leptin interacts with the immune system. People with protein energymalnutrition—people who are starving—have very low leptin levels. Low leptinlevels lower the production of interferon-alpha, tumor necrosis factor alpha,and nitric oxide generated by immune cells called macrophages. These people areprone to infections, since their immune system is not functioning well (Dandona,Aljada, and Bandyopadhyay 2004). For the same reason, they are less prone toautoimmune diseases like colitis and arthritis. Women, with their higher bodyfat percentage, have more leptin than men have and are more prone to autoimmunedisorders.Waist circumference correlates with markers of inflammation. Fat cells expandwhen we overeat, and they can then start to leak glycerol and fatty acids. Themacrophages then come in to clean up, and they release inflammatory chemicals(cytokines). The fat cells themselves help by releasing their own inflammatorycytokines. Chronic systemic inflammation is associated with atherosclerosis andinsulin resistance. The former is a major cardiovascular disease, and the latteris a contributing factor in further increases in obesity by making us overeateven more.Inside fat cells are molecules called perilipins. These surround the storedtriglycerides, preventing enzymes called lipases from breaking the fats downinto free fatty acids. However, as the fat cells swell up with extra fat, theycan’t keep up the production of perilipins. The result is the breakdown of fatinto free fatty acids, and the release of those fatty acids into thebloodstream. Muscle cells detect these fatty acids and respond by lowering theirsensitivity to insulin.Macrophages live in fatty tissue, and their numbers increase as we get fatter,since one of their functions is to eat fat cells that are no longer functioningproperly. The macrophages produce the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosisfactor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and several others, which notonly cause inflammation but also reduce insulin sensitivity (Dandona, Aljada,and Bandyopadhyay 2004). The cells also start producing more coagulant proteinsthat cause blood clots. TNF-alpha is also expressed by the fat cells themselves,and the enlarged fat cells found in obese animals overexpress it (Kahn and Flier2000).TNF-alpha is part of a feedback loop against excess energy storage. It inhibitsthe storage of new fat in the adipocytes (fat cells) and it increases thebreakdown of fat in those cells into glycerol and free fatty acids. It alsomakes tissues less sensitive to insulin (Kahn and Flier 2000).Inflammation raises insulin levels. The body adjusts by becoming insulinresistant. But high levels of insulin cause leptin resistance, so an importantsatiety signal is ignored, and we feel hungry all the time. Of course, thiscauses more overeating. In a very real sense, once we become fat, it is hard tolose weight because the inflammation is making us continue to overeat. We’re fatbecause we’re fat. Worse, insulin resistance causes more inflammation, leadingto another obesity cycle.Blood tests can be done to check for C-reactive protein, an important marker forinflammation. Elevated levels indicate chronic systemic inflammation andincrease the risk of heart attacks, strokes, high blood pressure, and muscleweakness.The key inflammatory cytokine known as interleukin-6 is induced by hyperglycemia(high blood sugar). Hyperglycemia happens when sugar comes into the blood fasterthan insulin can respond and remove it. In healthy individuals, this happenswhen we get too much sugar or fast-digesting starch. The resulting inflammationcauses insulin resistance, which means that we become even more susceptible tohyperglycemia. Another deadly cycle.When we eat too much, for whatever reasons, we get fat. The fat producesinflammation. The inflammation promotes insulin resistance. Insulin resistanceeliminates the anti-inflammatory effect of insulin, leading to moreinflammation. Antidiabetes drugs such as thiazolidinedione (an insulinsensitizer) can reduce insulin insensitivity and thus reduce inflammation,reducing the risk of heart disease (Dandona, Aljada, and Bandyopadhyay 2004).The saturated fat palmitic acid, the most common saturated fat found in plantsand animals, is produced in the body when we get excess carbohydrates. Highlevels of palmitic acid in the blood lead to the production of the inflammatorycytokine interleukin-1 beta. Other saturated fats, such as medium-chaintriglyceride (MCT) oil and coconut oil, have anti-inflammatory effects. Otheranti-inflammatory fats are the omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA (found in fishoil), alpha-linolenic acid (found in walnuts, walnut oil, hemp oil, and flaxoil), and the omega-6 fatty acid DGLA. Replacing high palmitic acid fats andhigh arachidonic acid fats with MCT oil and omega-3 fats can reduceinflammation. Replacing them with fats that are neither pro-inflammatory noranti-inflammatory, such as the oleic acid in olive oil, can also help. Dairy fatcontains trans-palmitoleic acid, which is anti-inflammatory and reduces bloodlipid (triglycerides and cholesterol) levels and blood levels of C-reactiveprotein (Bernstein, Roizen, and Martinez 2014).Other foods that promote inflammation are refined carbohydrates (sugar, whitebread, pastries, etc.), fried foods (french fries), red meat, processed meat(hot dogs and sausage), margarine, shortening, and lard. Oxidized cholesterol infried foods damages white blood cells, leading to inflammation.Anti-inflammatory foods include tomatoes, olive oil, green leafy vegetables,nuts (almonds, walnuts), fatty fish (salmon, sardines), shiitake mushrooms,beets, and many fruits (blueberries, cherries, strawberries, oranges). Importantanti-inflammatory spices include turmeric, cloves, rosemary, cinnamon, allspice,oregano, marjoram, sage, thyme, peppers, onions, garlic, and ginger. Green teaalso has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Fermented foods such aspickles, olives, yogurt, and sauerkraut are anti-inflammatory. Dietary fiber isalso anti-inflammatory.FETAL PROGRAMMINGFetal programming is a stress response where effects on the mother, such asstress caused by food insecurity, cause changes in the fetus that affect how theoffspring react to food, reward, and stress. This kind of programming is notfound only in the fetus. In studies of juvenile macaque monkeys whose motherswere exposed to food insecurity when the monkeys were three to five months old,researchers found increased BMI, waist circumference, and insulin resistance inthe young (Bose, Oliván, and Laferrère 2009).In studies of the 1944 Dutch famine survivors, low birth weight due to maternalmalnutrition was associated with obesity and metabolic disease (such asdiabetes) when the children grew to adulthood (Bose, Oliván, and Laferrère2009).Animal studies of fetal dietary restriction show increased levels ofglucocorticoids in the adult animals. Prenatal exposure to these stress hormonesleads to impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in the adult animals.In humans, low birth weight is associated with smaller head circumference atbirth, short stature, and excess cortisol in middle age. Low BMI at age seven isassociated with higher cortisol levels and higher waist-to-hip ratios in adultmen and women.In studies of obesity in rats, mothers who were undernourished during pregnancygave birth to pups that were significantly smaller at birth and that ate morethan control rats did. The overeating increased as the rats aged and wasaccelerated by a high-fat diet. These rats also showed high insulin levels, highleptin levels, and high blood pressure (Vickers et al. 2000).Fetal programming does not alter the genes themselves in the fetus. Instead,what is altered is the expression of the genes, in ways that adapt the fetus tochanges in the environment during development (Breier et al. 2001). The keysystems affected are the leptin and insulin systems, leading to insensitivitiesin both. Fetal programming is not just caused by famine. Obese mothers also givebirth to children with appetite regulation problems and insulin resistance.There is a J-shaped or U-shaped distribution of birth weight to adult obesity,with low birth weights and high birth weight both being associated with adultfat mass (McMillen, Adam, and Mühlhäusler 2005). There is also an associationwith the birth weight of both the mother and the father on the birth weight ofthe child. Adjusting the BMI of the mother before or during pregnancy reducesthis association, indicating that it is fetal programming, not genetics, atwork. Heavier mothers have heavier babies, and this causes obesity later in life(McMillen, Adam, and Mühlhäusler 2005).Complications of pregnancies caused by type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes, orsimply impaired glucose tolerance are also associated with later obesity in theoffspring. Studies of diabetic mothers show that half of them had children withweights in the 90th percentile at birth and at age eight (McMillen, Adam, andMühlhäusler 2005).Small babies tend to have lower BMI in adult life, but this is due to reducedmuscle mass, not reduced fat. In fact, they have higher abdominal fat, andhigher overall fat, than adults born at normal weight. As we have seen,abdominal fat is what puts people at risk of metabolic syndrome. These babiesalso have higher leptin levels later in life.As the obesity epidemic increases, the number of obese mothers will increase,and thus the number of babies programmed to be obese in later life willincrease. This is a positive feedback that is likely to have contributed to thecurrent global obesity crisis.LOW INCOME AND LOW EDUCATIONIn the developing world, the populations with high social classes have greaterrates of obesity (Mohamed et al. 2014). The opposite seems to be the case in thedeveloped world. In the latter environment, the cheapest foods are those madefrom subsidized grains and sugar, and access to fresh whole foods in poorneighborhoods is more limited, so those with lower income often find itdifficult to afford high-protein, high-fiber, fresh, and unprocessed foods.Those with less education many also tend toward obesity in the developed world,since many of them miss out on diet and lifestyle advice that counters theadvertising from food manufacturers. It’s difficult, though, to separateeducation from income as a factor, since they’re so frequently linked.However, many dietary interventions are both available in low-income areas andaffordable. Dried beans are inexpensive, keep well, and are available in bulk.They are both high in fiber and high in protein, and low in quickly digestedcarbohydrate. The carbohydrate can be further countered by eating cooked beandishes cold, so some of the starch becomes resistant to digestion, and by usingvinegar dressings (in a cold bean salad) to reduce the digestibility of whatstarch remains. Frozen or canned vegetables are almost as good as fresh,in-season vegetables; they also keep well and are available year-round. (Freshcarrots are available year-round as well, and are often available in largequantities—for juicing—at very low prices, but these are often available only inwell-to-do neighborhoods.) It is possible to eat a healthy diet on a strictbudget. However, there are far too many people who run out of food money beforethe end of the month, no matter what foods they buy.Low income and low social status are stressors in modern life, and, as we saw inthe section on the stress response, the result is upper-body obesity,depression, and metabolic syndrome (Bose, Oliván, and Laferrère 2009). Lowincome is often associated with stressors such as job strain and sleepdeprivation. The temptation to treat the stress response with comfort food isstrong, as the alternatives such as exercise, meditation, yoga, and positivesocial interactions are less available to people with fewer means."},{"pageContent":"9Image [images/conical.jpg]WHEN WE EAT AFFECTS HOMEOSTASISFASTINGOur bodies have a set point for how much fat we carry. If we reduce our foodintake, the body reduces our metabolic rate in order to maintain the preciousfat we have stored. If we have become insulin resistant, the high insulin levelsput a priority on storing fat instead of burning it, and our set point rises.So how do we reduce insulin resistance? We undo the cause of it. We becameinsulin resistant by having constant high levels of insulin. Each of the twocomponents—the constant part, and the high levels part—can be fixed.Whenever we eat we raise our insulin levels. Some foods raise it more thanothers, but all foods raise insulin.The way to fix insulin resistance is to stop eating. Completely. Allow the bodyto have extended periods of very low insulin levels. This is how we reset theinsulin sensitivity levels. We need to feel hungry. That means no food for awhole day (24 hours), or better yet, for 36 hours.We already fast for 8 hours or more, every day. We don’t eat a lot when we’resleeping. (If you do, that is a problem we don’t cover in this book, but itsounds dangerous, and you should get some professional help.) Since we startwith a free 8 hours of fasting, all we need is another 16 hours. Just hold outuntil dinner. Or, once you have become accustomed to an occasional fast, stickit out until breakfast, giving you 32 hours of low insulin levels. Holding outuntil lunch gives you that 36 hours.Humans, and pretty much all animals, have evolved to handle periods where foodis not available. This is a normal state in the wild. Our ancestors didn’t eatwhen they were ill, when winter stores ran out, during frequent famines, andoften for religious reasons. We are built to handle fasting. It is only in themodern world, where food is everywhere, that we seem to think we have to eat allthe time. Snacking is a modern invention of the food industry. Mothers used totell their children not to eat between meals, lest it spoil their dinner. Thereason we have any fat at all is to tide us over in lean times. Now is the timeto use those fat stores.We store energy in two forms: fat (triglycerides) and glycogen. Glycogen is astarch-like carbohydrate made up of many glucose molecules bound together. It isstored in the liver, where it can be quickly converted into glucose when it isbroken down, in a process called glycogenolysis (a word that just means“breaking up glycogen”). Muscle cells also store some glycogen when prompted toby insulin.After 24 hours without eating, glycogen stores in the liver are gone. Thisleaves the liver with only one way to make glucose, which is to use lactate,glycerol, or amino acids as a base. The amino acids come from proteins. Theglycerol is the part of fat that isn’t a fatty acid. Lactate is formed whenglucose is used for energy without being burned first.Making glucose from glycogen requires energy, meaning that the net energyreceived when the glucose is finally burned is lower than when free glucose fromdigestion of food is used.It is obvious that if we stop eating, we will lose weight. The current recordfor fasting is 382 days (Stewart and Fleming 1973). A 27-year-old male whoweighed 456 pounds underwent a medically monitored fast, consuming onlynoncaloric fluids and vitamins. Every day he submitted urine samples foranalysis, and mineral supplements were added as indicated by the analysis.During this time, he felt well, had no symptoms of any illness, and walkedaround normally. He lost an average of 0.72 pounds per day. Several other longfasts have been recorded, from 210 days to 256 days, with similar results.After a day or so of fasting, the liver is creating glucose from amino acids andglycerol. Fats are broken apart into glycerin and fatty acids. The glycerin isused to make glucose, and the fatty acids are used directly by muscles andorgans. Some fatty acids are broken down into molecules called ketone bodies,which feed the brain.After about 24 hours of not eating, we switch from burning stored glucose toburning fats. Blood glucose levels remain steady, since we are producing glucosefrom the glycerin in the fat. Insulin levels drop throughout the fast, andlonger fasts allow the insulin to drop the most.This drop in insulin is very important. Unlike dieting, which only preventsincreases in insulin, fasting actually lowers insulin, which is key to gettingback your insulin sensitivity.After about three days of fasting, the body starts producing high levels ofhuman growth hormone and adrenaline (Ho et al. 1988). The HGH maintains leanbody mass, so your muscles aren’t used as food. That only happens when the lastof your fat stores are depleted, and we aren’t going anywhere near that point.Growth hormone levels can double after five days of fasting.The adrenaline maintains your metabolic rate, so we stay warm and have theenergy to go out and find food. Adrenaline levels rise after 24 hours offasting, and can rise by over 3 percent after 48 hours. This is not so much thatyou feel jittery and anxious, but it can increase your metabolic rate by 14percent after four days. Note that this is the opposite of what happens when yousimply decrease the amount of food you eat. You need to exhaust your storedglucose supplies to make this happen.But we don’t have to go anywhere near those extremes. We aren’t racing. If youfast once a week, and lose three-quarters of a pound each time, that adds up tojust under 40 pounds a year. Fast twice a week for 24 hours each, losing a pounda week, you drop 52 pounds in a year.For many people, it is much easier to fast than it is to diet. It is easier tosay no to all food than it is to try to limit meals to small portions.The important thing to note is that when we switch from burning stored glucoseto burning fat, that switch is accompanied by several hormonal changes thatbenefit weight loss. Just reducing calories, as in all the popular diet plans,does not give these benefits. Calorie reduction lowers the metabolic rate.Fasting does not, and extended fasting actually increases the metabolic rate.Calorie reduction does not correct insulin resistance. Fasting does.The longer you fast, the more your appetite decreases. Your body becomesaccustomed to the new regime and stops insisting that you eat. You will stillfeel hunger spurts, but less often.When your stomach produces ghrelin, it does so in little spurts. It is areminder, not a constant alarm. You feel a hunger spurt, but it goes away aftera few minutes, and doesn’t return for 20 minutes or more. It is easier to fastthan most overfed people think it is. When you feel hungry, drink a glass ofwater. The hunger goes away.For most obese people, after a couple days of fasting, hunger just vanishesaltogether. The body has switched to burning fat, and it knows it is holdingmonths of food.Unlike calorie restriction dieting, there is an end to intermittent fasting.Instead of making a lifestyle adjustment for the rest of your life, you can justfast periodically. Most people find that this is much easier to do. It is easierto have a short period of “won’t” power than a long period of willpower. Ofcourse, some lifestyle changes, such as changing from a high-sugar, high-fatdiet to a high-fiber, high-protein diet, or getting more exercise, have manybenefits beyond weight loss and are highly recommended. But those changes areusually easier to maintain, since they increase well-being and don’t cause asense of sacrifice.There are several other benefits to fasting than just losing weight andregaining insulin sensitivity. A 48-hour fast leads to a 50 percent reduction inreactive oxygen species generation by leukocytes in the blood (Dandona, Aljada,and Bandyopadhyay 2004). This reduces inflammation, which we have seen has largeeffects on obesity and diabetes. Nonobese test subjects given excessive levelsof carbohydrate and fat had pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory effects similar towhat obese patients have as a normal condition.During the first part of the fast, up to about five days, you lose water andsalts. This is because high insulin levels cause the kidneys to store salt andwater. As the insulin levels drop, you can lose almost two pounds a day, as youget rid of the bloating and water retention caused by high insulin levels. Thisalso can lower blood pressure. Even short fasts of 24 hours will have thiseffect until insulin levels are under control.Fasting creates a sense of well-being, almost a mild euphoria.In the section on the hunger hormone ghrelin, we discussed many desirableeffects of allowing the stomach to create the hormone: * Ghrelin protects against atherosclerosis by acting on receptors in the blood vessels. * Ghrelin is an antidepressant and reduces anxiety. * Ghrelin inhibits insulin release after a meal. * Ghrelin has anti-inflammatory effects and helps cells grow despite stress. * Ghrelin is being considered as a therapy for colitis and sepsis. * Ghrelin helps the stomach regenerate after injury to its mucosal layers. * Ghrelin releases human growth hormone (HGH). * Ghrelin modulates sugar and fat metabolism. * Ghrelin regulates gastrointestinal motility (it makes food move through your digestive system better). * Ghrelin protects neurons and cardiovascular cells. * Ghrelin regulates the immune system. * Ghrelin acts on the brain’s hippocampus to increase learning and memory. * Ghrelin helps you form new brain cells, even in adulthood.All these benefits of ghrelin come with its other effect, making you feelhungry. Allow yourself to feel hungry between meals. You will be smarter,stronger, and healthier.In the United States, about 60 percent of yearly weight gain happens during theholidays. Consider fasting once the leftovers are gone, to get back to yourpreholiday weight (or less). It can be very hard to diet when others arefeasting. Go ahead and celebrate with them. If you allow yourself theindulgence, you can undo the harm when the guests have gone home. Let the skinnyones take home that extra pie and mashed potatoes.INTERMITTENT CALORIE RESTRICTIONJust reducing daily calories by two-thirds for two days a week has been found tobe as effective for weight loss as continuous dieting. In fact, intermittentdieting has been found to produce slightly better fasting insulin levels andslightly lower insulin resistance than continuous dieting (Harvie et al. 2010).In a study of men fasting for 20 hours every other day, insulin sensitivity rose700 percent (Halberg et al. 2005). Levels of adiponectin, the fat-burninghormone that increases insulin sensitivity, rose 37 percent. In this study, thesubjects were told to eat abundantly on their nonfasting days so their bodyweight and body fat percentages would stay the same. Eating normally insteadwould cause weight loss and reduce fat.We are able to make mice live longer by reducing their calorie intakedramatically. This is obviously very hard to do with humans in today’s “foodeverywhere” environment. But one study in mice found that alternate-day fastinghad similar effects, improving glucose management and brain cell resistance tostress, even though the mice maintained their body weight by eating more onnonfasting days (Anson et al. 2002). In another study of intermittent fasting,it was found to increase learning and memory (L. Li, Wang, and Zuo 2013).Eating a single meal per day, even when the same number of daily calories isconsumed, reduces fat more than consuming three meals a day. You get thebenefits of fasting for 24 hours. Your insulin levels drop for that period, andyou get your insulin sensitivity back.Even when the same number of daily calories is consumed, eating more meals perday increases liver fat and abdominal fat more than eating three or fewer mealsper day.There are many approaches to intermittent fasting. Some of the popular ones are: * Eating one meal a day. You still want to make it a healthy meal, but it can be 2,000 calories. * Alternate between eating normally and eating only one meal every other day. Drink plenty of noncaloric liquids for two non-meals. * Fasting completely every other day. Drink noncaloric liquids and perhaps a cup of vegetable broth. * Fasting two days a week. * Fasting one day per week. This can be for 24 or 36 hours or more. * Eating only during one 8-hour period during the day (16 hours of fasting). This is basically just skipping breakfast every day. Lunch at noon, dinner before 8.Eliminating snacks is important. Allow your insulin levels to drop betweenmeals, no matter how many meals you end up eating. Make sure you are gettingenough liquids and replace the salt you lose. A lack of fluid (dehydration) canmake you feel weak or dizzy or give you headaches. It isn’t the lack of food.Get enough magnesium, either from multivitamin pills or a soak in an Epsom saltsbath.When you aren’t fasting, make sure you get plenty of fiber. Even when you arefasting, you can take pure fiber supplements: Metamucil or fiber capsules. Notonly will this fill your stomach and quell hunger spikes, but it will preventconstipation.Don’t stuff yourself when you do eat. This can cause heartburn and acid reflux.Eat slowly so your body has time to notice how much food you have eaten and cansignal you with satiety hormones. This generally takes about 20 minutes. Eatinghigh-fiber foods that take longer to chew—salads, carrots, other vegetables—is anatural way to slow down a meal. Processed foods are designed to melt in themouth and be eaten quickly, so you consume much more food before your body cantell you to stop. Eat more natural foods, not food that has been prechewed foryou in a factory or in a blender.When you do eat, eat healthy. Avoid sugars and processed foods. Fasting is not alicense to eat anything you want on nonfasting days. We are trying to becomemore insulin sensitive. Eating sugar and wheat flour when we aren’t fastingsabotages that. That’s how we got here. Don’t do that.Drink plenty of noncaloric liquids and replace any missing salt and minerals.Give yourself a month to get used to intermittent fasting. If it is difficult atfirst, stick with it, and it will get easier. Unlike dieting, studies have shownthat intermittent fasting programs have an 80 percent compliance record (Hankey,Klukowska, and Lean 2015). People find it much easier to skip meals than to dietevery day.Pick carefully whom you tell about your fasting. Some people will try tosabotage your willpower. Others will be part of a beneficial support system.Find out which of your friends and coworkers are in each group, and controltheir access to information about your diet.Stay busy. Work, hobbies, exercise, entertainment—all of these will take yourmind off food during your fast. Get away from the kitchen, and away fromtempting food sources and advertising. A walk in the park, a friendly game, evena drive in the car can take you away from temptations.Don’t binge when you aren’t fasting. Just eat normally, or even a little moreslowly than your old normal. Many people became overweight by not givingthemselves enough time to become sated. Take it easy. Take the time to enjoyyour meals.Intermittent fasting works even better when combined with exercise.A RELAXED DAY MAY HELP RAISE LEPTIN LEVELSThere is some support for the idea that getting an extra 1,000 calories per dayone day per week can raise leptin levels. Higher leptin levels mean you don’tfeel hungry all the time. To make up for the extra calories, you can have a daywith 1,000 fewer calories once a week. A day of fasting once a week more thanmakes up for this.In popular diet literature, this is often called a cheat day, but the psychologyof that term tends to make the practice fail. You aren’t cheating. You don’thave license to eat a bunch of sugar and fat. This is a period when you aregetting more calories than you do during the rest of the week.A cheat day is a day when you get to eat a cheat meal. You don’t get to bingeall day. Rather than relaxing the rules for an entire day, relaxing them for oneparticular meal per week can make a diet easier to follow. If you areentertaining, or being entertained, allowing yourself to relax the rules forthat meal and enjoy the pasta, bread, or potatoes not only gives you somethingto look forward to during the week but can actually boost your metabolism andleptin levels as well.You should find a diet where you can enjoy your meals, so you don’t feel a needto “cheat.” A high-protein, low glycemic index diet is satisfying to the 67percent of people who have the genes that make that diet successful. For theother third of humanity, there are other diets that also work, as well asinterventions such as adding vinegar when you eat starches, avoiding sugar,fasting, avoiding between-meal snacks, and so on. All these diets andinterventions allow you to eat foods you enjoy, so you can feel comfortable andnot feel the need to binge.In the scientific literature, there is support for a mild form of fasting calledtime-restricted feeding, or TRF, a form of intermittent fasting (discussed inmore detail in the preceding section, page 180 [012_Chapter09.xhtml#page_180]).This is where you eat only during a particular time window each day. This istypically an eight- or nine-hour period, but the longer the fasting period, andthus the shorter the feeding period, the more weight loss occurs. In thisregimen, adding a weekend of eating whenever you like has been shown to retainmost of the benefits of a weeklong routine, at least in mice (Chaix et al.2014).A similar protocol is the 90/10 rule. Allowing yourself a relaxed meal one timeout of 10 allows you to have something to look forward to and makes the dietless forbidding and onerous. The limit of one in 10 helps to prevent bingeingand blowing the plan.Whether cheat meals are right for you may depend on your genes (Poehlman et al.1986). Overfeeding affects people in different ways, depending on differences intheir genetic makeup. Monitor your results, and if the reward meal isn’t workingfor you, work on making every healthy meal rewarding instead.Many of the studies done on overfeeding have been done on lean animals—usuallyrats or mice—or on lean people (Dirlewanger et al. 2000). Overweight and obesepeople react differently to challenges to their insulin and glucose levels.People who are insulin resistant will not react favorably to a sudden glucosechallenge, while lean individuals react with increased energy expenditure andincreased leptin levels. Even lean people don’t benefit from overfeeding onfats. Only carbohydrate overfeeding provided any metabolic and leptin boost.If you have a diet that is working for you, you should definitely not add anycheat meals. Don’t fix it if it ain’t broken. But if you are finding yourselfunable to stick with a particularly restrictive regime, adding an incentivereward just might help."},{"pageContent":"10Image [images/conical.jpg]HOW TO TELL WHICH OF THE WEIGHT-GAIN FACTORS APPLY TO YOUSome questions to ask yourself: * Am I addicted to sugar? * Do I eat a lot of processed foods and foods made from wheat flour? * Do I get enough sleep? * Am I under a lot of stress? * Do I get enough exercise? * Do I keep mindlessly eating as long as there is food in front of me? * Do I allow three to four hours for insulin levels to drop between meals? * Do I eat so quickly that the satiety signals don’t have time to tell me to stop eating? * Am I impulsive? * Am I conscientious? * Do I get too much blue light from TV or computer screens after dark? * Do I have obesity-related genes? * Do I have the right gut bacteria? * Do I eat enough fiber? * Do I drink too much alcohol? * Do I eat for pleasure when I’m not hungry? * Do I have a low metabolic rate? * Am I depressed or on antidepressants? * Do I have chronic inflammation? * Am I constantly under a lot of stress?GENETIC TESTINGThere are many companies that will test your DNA and give you results you canscreen for obesity-related genes. One of the more well-known companies is23andMe. Once you get the results, you can browse through the data on a webpage. An example of one result, for the rs1421085 location on the FTO gene, isshown below:Image [images/186.jpg]In this case, the person was homozygous (both father and mother contributed) forthe variant where a cytosine replaced a thymine (a C replaced a T), which makesthis gene unable to function. The result is that cells that might have turnedinto beige fat cells that burn fat instead turn into white fat cells that storefat.The test results will often also include a huge list of the SNPs (singlenucleotide polymorphisms—changes in the gene where a single nucleotide [an A, C,G, or T] is changed), and which variant you have. A small portion of such a listis shown on the next page.This shows the SNP rs987237, where the AA variant means you will do well (loseweight) on a low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet. The AG and GG variants do notbenefit as much from this diet. Not surprisingly, the AG and GG variants areassociated with obesity.Image [images/187.jpg]Other genome sequencing companies besides 23andMe are FitnessGenes, Genos,Health Nucleus, Map My Gene, Nutrigenomics, GenePlanet, Gonidio, DNAFit, NewLife Genetics, Genetic Health, LifeGenetics, Labrix, Pathway Genomics, IBBiotech, and Futura Genetics—the list grows almost daily.BLOOD TESTSBlood tests are available that can lend insight into the causes, and thuspossible treatments, of obesity. Some of the more common ones are: * Hemoglobin A1c test * Fasting glucose test * Oral glucose tolerance test * Fasting lipid panel * Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) test * C-reactive protein test * Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) testThe hemoglobin A1c test is usually a test for diabetes, as it tells you whatyour average glucose levels were over the previous three months. Blood glucosereacts with many proteins, and hemoglobin is a protein. The result is glycatedhemoglobin, which this test looks for. The image on the next page shows thestructure of a glycated hemoglobin protein. You can see the iron-centeredfourring structures inside, and a few tiny glucose molecules, such as the one inthe center of the middle cluster.Image [images/188.jpg]Red blood cells live only about four months, so the average level of glycatedhemoglobin gives an estimate of the average blood sugar levels over the previousthree months or so, depending on the current rate of blood cell replacement.Blood cells are replaced faster if we need to replace blood after losing it toaccident, surgery, or blood donation, so the test will give false results inthese situations.The test results are also more sensitive to recent blood glucose levels than toolder ones, so it is more accurate if the diet or lifestyle has not changed inthe last three to four months.The hemoglobin A1c test can be used as a hint to the levels of advancedglycation end products, since they are produced by the same processes.The fasting glucose test measures sugar in the blood after a nighttime fast. Ifblood sugar levels are high after fasting, this indicates a problem in glucosemetabolism.The oral glucose tolerance test starts with a fasting glucose test, then youdrink a sugary solution, and your blood sugar levels are tested over the nexttwo hours. High blood sugar levels after two hours are an indication of diabetesand poor glucose metabolism.The fasting lipid panel tells you about your blood cholesterol and triglyceridelevels. It is used to determine the risk of cardiovascular disease. It is doneby taking blood after a nighttime fast, so that it won’t reflect the most recentmeal as much, but what you are actually interested in is the average levels offats in the blood throughout a typical day. The numbers given by the test arefor total cholesterol, high-density lipoproteins (HDL), low-density lipoproteins(LDL), very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), all non-HDL cholesterol, the ratioof total cholesterol to HDL, and the total amount of fat in the blood.Fat does not mix with water, and blood is mostly water. For fats to betransported in the blood, they must first be broken down into tiny droplets, andthese droplets must be surrounded by a membrane that keeps them from clumpingback together. The membrane is made up of proteins, cholesterol, and a moleculecalled a phospholipid, a kind of detergent, with a water-loving phosphorus atomat one end and a fat-loving oily tail at the other. This detergent surrounds thefat droplet, with the oily ends in the fat and the water-loving ends facing thewater. The proteins help keep the whole thing together and interact withreceptors on cells in the liver and other tissues. The cholesterol also has awater-loving end and a fatty end, and it fits in with the phospholipids andhelps keep the membrane flexible and strong.When we eat fats, the small intestine breaks them up and wraps them up incholesterol-phospholipid-protein packets called chylomicrons. These are largefat droplets, and they get transferred in the blood until they reach the liver.The liver repackages them as smaller VLDL droplets, which are carried to the fatcells for storage or to other tissues for burning. As the fats in the dropletsare gradually depleted by cells that cleave off fatty acids, the droplets becomedenser, since fats are less dense than the membrane around them. Theselipoprotein droplets make their way back to the liver, where they are reused tomake new VLDL droplets. Some of the LDL particles don’t make it to the liver butare eaten by immune cells called macrophages. These can turn into what arecalled foam cells and stick to artery walls, causing atherosclerosis. This iswhy we call LDL the “bad” cholesterol.The liver also makes HDL droplets that have very little fat in them. Their jobis to pick up cholesterol from tissues in the body and transport it to othertissues, where the cholesterol is needed to build cell walls. This function iswhy we call HDL the “good” cholesterol.When we eat foods containing cholesterol, the liver doesn’t need to produce asmuch cholesterol itself. The total amount of cholesterol in the body doesn’tchange much due to dietary cholesterol levels. This is why we no longer worryabout eating foods like eggs, which have more cholesterol than, say, carrots.Every cell in our body needs cholesterol to make its cell walls, and we willmake cholesterol if we don’t get enough in the diet.The alanine aminotransferase (ALT) test detects problems with the liver, such ascirrhosis or hepatitis, caused by alcohol, drugs, or viruses. In concert withthe other blood tests, it can be used to diagnose nonalcoholic fatty liverdisease, whereupon an imaging test such as ultrasound, MRI, or CAT scan is usedto confirm it.The C-reactive protein test is another test to determine risk of heart disease.The liver produces a molecule called C-reactive protein in response toinflammation. High levels of this molecule in the blood tell you and your doctorthat you have inflammation from some source. It does not tell you if that sourceis a bee sting or atherosclerosis in coronary arteries. This test is usuallymore predictive of heart problems than the lipid panel (cholesterol test),especially for women.Since one of the important causes of obesity is inflammation, this test can helpyou decide a course of action. Of course, obesity is also a cause ofinflammation, so you might want to consider anti-inflammatory diet suggestionseven without bothering to get the test. Increasing omega-3 fats, decreasinginflammatory omega-6 fats, and getting lots of anti-inflammatory colorful plantmolecules (green, orange, or red veggies; turmeric; capsaicin; etc.) is neverharmful.The thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) test tells you if you have a healthythyroid gland. An underactive thyroid can cause weight gain, fatigue, dry skin,feeling too cold, or constipation. An overactive thyroid causes weight loss,rapid heart rate, nervousness, diarrhea, and feeling too hot. While it isunlikely that your weight problem is due to an underactive thyroid, this is aneasy condition to test for and to treat.STOOL ANALYSISTesting the stool can tell us whether we have a low diversity of intestinalmicrobes (bad), and what the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes is. It canalso detect harmful organisms as well as check for colon cancer and parasites.It can detect disease of the digestive tract, liver, or pancreas. Larger samplescollected over 72 hours can be used to check for undigested fat and protein,indicating poor absorption in the digestive tract.There are several companies that will do a microbial ecology test. Below is partof one page of such a test, showing relative amounts of various intestinalmicrobes:Image [images/191.jpg]A crowd-funded program called the American Gut Project (http://americangut.org/[http://americangut.org]) will sell you a stool sample kit; after the sample issubmitted and analyzed, the results are posted on a website you can log into.Your sample results are added to a growing database of microbial data that canbe studied by scientists to learn more about our symbiotic little friends.THE POWER OF FOODThe Power of Food Scale helps us to determine the psychological impact of livingin a food-abundant environment (Cappelleri et al. 2009). The questionnaire isshown on the next page. 1. I find myself thinking about food even when I am not physically hungry 2. When I’m in a situation where delicious foods are present but I have to wait to eat them, it is very difficult for me to wait 3. I get more pleasure from eating than I do from almost anything else 4. I feel that food is to me like liquor is to an alcoholic 5. If I see or smell a food I like, I get a powerful urge to have some 6. When I’m around fattening food I love, it’s hard to stop myself from at least tasting it 7. I often think about what foods I might eat later in the day 8. It’s scary to think of the power that food has over me 9. When I taste a favorite food, I feel intense pleasure 10. When I know a delicious food is available, I can’t help myself from thinking about having some 11. I love the taste of certain foods so much that I can’t avoid eating them even if they’re bad for me 12. When I see delicious foods in advertisements or commercials, it makes me want to eat 13. I feel like food controls me rather than the other way around 14. Just before I taste a favorite food, I feel intense anticipation 15. When I eat delicious food, I focus a lot on how good it tastes 16. Sometimes, when I’m doing everyday activities, I get an urge to eat “out of the blue” (for no apparent reason) 17. I think I enjoy eating, a lot more than most other people 18. Hearing someone describe a great meal makes me really want to have something to eat 19. It seems like I have food on my mind a lot 20. It’s very important to me that the foods I eat are as delicious as possible 21. Before I eat a favorite food, my mouth tends to flood with salivaTHE THREE-FACTOR EATING QUESTIONNAIREThis is a questionnaire designed to determine scores for three categories ofpsychological or emotional components of eating behavior (FLVS Study Group2004). Those three factors are uncontrolled eating, cognitive restraint, andemotional eating. The questionnaire is shown here: 1. When I smell a sizzling steak or juicy piece of meat, I find it very difficult to keep from eating, even if I have just finished a meal. Definitely true (4) • Mostly true (3) • Mostly false (2) • Definitely false (1) 2. I deliberately take small helpings as a means of controlling my weight. Definitely true (4) • Mostly true (3) • Mostly false (2) • Definitely false (1) 3. When I feel anxious, I find myself eating. Definitely true (4) • Mostly true (3) • Mostly false (2) • Definitely false (1) 4. Sometimes when I start eating, I just can’t seem to stop. Definitely true (4) • Mostly true (3) • Mostly false (2) • Definitely false (1) 5. Being with someone who is eating often makes me hungry enough to eat also. Definitely true (4) • Mostly true (3) • Mostly false (2) • Definitely false (1) 6. When I feel blue, I often overeat. Definitely true (4) • Mostly true (3) • Mostly false (2) • Definitely false (1) 7. When I see a real delicacy, I often get so hungry that I have to eat right away. Definitely true (4) • Mostly true (3) • Mostly false (2) • Definitely false (1) 8. I get so hungry that my stomach often seems like a bottomless pit. Definitely true (4) • Mostly true (3) • Mostly false (2) • Definitely false (1) 9. I am always hungry so it is hard for me to stop eating before I finish the food on my plate. Definitely true (4) • Mostly true (3) • Mostly false (2) • Definitely false (1) 10. When I feel lonely, I console myself by eating. Definitely true (4) • Mostly true (3) • Mostly false (2) • Definitely false (1) 11. I consciously hold back at meals in order not to gain weight. Definitely true (4) • Mostly true (3) • Mostly false (2) • Definitely false (1) 12. I do not eat some foods because they make me fat. Definitely true (4) • Mostly true (3) • Mostly false (2) • Definitely false (1) 13. I am always hungry enough to eat at any time. Definitely true (4) • Mostly true (3) • Mostly false (2) • Definitely false (1) 14. How often do you feel hungry? Only at meal times (1) • Sometimes between meals (2) • Often between meals (3) • Almost always (4) 15. How frequently do you avoid “stocking up” on tempting foods? Almost never (1) • Seldom (2) • Usually (3) • Almost always (4) 16. How likely are you to consciously eat less than you want? Unlikely (1) • Slightly likely (2) • Moderately likely (3) • Very likely (4) 17. Do you go on eating binges though you are not hungry? Never (1) • Rarely (2) • Sometimes (3) • At least once a week (4) 18. On a scale of 1 to 8, where 1 means no restraint in eating (eating whatever you want, whenever you want it) and 8 means total restraint (constantly limiting food intake and never “giving in”), what number would you give yourself? 1 or 2 on the scale (1) • 3 or 4 on the scale (2) • 5 or 6 on the scale (3) • 7 or 8 on the scale (4)The cognitive restraint scale is composed of items 2, 11, 12, 15, 16, and 18.The uncontrolled eating scale is composed of items 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, and17. The emotional eating scale is composed of items 3, 6, and 10.You can answer the questionnaire and score it yourself (take the average of theanswers in each of the three categories). That will give you some idea ofwhether you have problems in any category.Knowing that you have a problem with emotional eating, for example, you mightdecide to fix the root problem (talk to a friend other than Ben & Jerry ifyou’re lonely) instead of trying to eat your way out of it.If you have an issue with restraint, you might try interventions such asweighing or photographing your food before you eat, using smaller plates, alwayseating with someone who can help monitor portions, and so on.If you score high in uncontrolled eating, you might look for tricks to help youstay in control. Fasting is one method—it is much easier to say no to everythingfor a day than to try to measure and control each bite. Fasting also helps tofix underlying metabolic problems that might be causing the uncontrolled eating(not everything is about psychology; sometimes biology is to blame).MEASURING WAIST-TO-HIP RATIOThe hip circumference is measured by using a flexible tape measure across thebuttocks where they extend the most in the back. The waist circumference ismeasured by placing the tape around the waist at the midpoint between the bonesof the ribs and the bones of the pelvis—this is about an inch above the navel,but in obese people, this may not be the narrowest place. The tape should alwaysbe parallel to the floor. The tape should not stretch, and the tension should belight (100 grams). Measure after letting out a breath.Divide the waist circumference by the hip circumference to get the waist-to-hipratio. For example, if your waist measurement is 38 and your hip measurement is42, your waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) is 0.9.Normal values for men are less than 0.9. For women, normal values are less than0.8. Overweight for men is 0.9 to 0.99, and 0.8 to 0.84 for women. Obese for menis over 1.0 and over 0.85 for women.ACTIVITY MONITORSThere are a large number of these devices on the market. Worn on the wrist, theycan measure the number of steps you have taken each day so you can be motivatedto get more exercise, or monitor movement at night, to tell you how many hoursof sleep you are getting.Many of these devices sync with your cell phone and can upload data to theInternet, where you can examine it on a large screen or share it with weightloss or exercise partners so you can motivate one another through friendlycompetition.Some have GPS, so that in addition to footsteps, they can tell how far youcycled on a bike or how far up the hill you have climbed.It is important not to lose focus on your behavior, however. Fitness trackersmay allow some people to ignore how much they eat or how much they actuallyexercise, compared to people who track their exercise by hand, say, by enteringinformation on a website. The extra effort involved in keeping an activity logby hand can help focus on the goals, and on the activities needed to reach them.Competing with friends who are also trying to get more exercise may help here,especially if the friends are close to your own performance levels, or you havea large enough number of them that you aren’t always at the bottom of the list.BODY COMPOSITIONAs with activity monitors, there are a number of companies offering bathroomscales that measure not just weight, but body fat percentage, water percentage,protein percentage, heart rate, and arterial blood flow, and calculate your BMI.They can calculate how much you have gained or lost since you last weighedyourself, or since the same time the previous day. The better ones also send thedata to your phone or to a website, so you can see long-term trends andperformance graphs.Below and on the next page are some typical graphs from the webpage of oneInternet-connected bathroom scale:Image [images/196-1.jpg]Image [images/196-2.jpg]Image [images/197-1.jpg]Image [images/197-2.jpg]Image [images/197-3.jpg]SIGNS OF INSULIN RESISTANCEInsulin resistance is usually tested by a doctor, but there are signs you canlook for yourself. You may have taken a cholesterol test at a drugstore orpurchased a blood glucose test kit there, along with your blood pressuremonitor. The signs to look for are: * Skin tags * Loud snoring * Excessive daytime sleepiness * Sleep apnea (waking up to take a breath) * Ovarian cysts (polycystic ovary syndrome, or PCOS) * High blood pressure (hypertension) * High blood cholesterol * High blood sugar * High blood triglycerides * Acanthosis nigricans (dark skin in body folds and creases)"},{"pageContent":"11Image [images/conical.jpg]REMEDIESDIET REMEDIESREDUCE OR ELIMINATE SUGAR AND FLOUROf course, the first dietary intervention should be to eliminate sucrose andfructose from the diet. No sugar. No agave nectar (made almost entirely out offructose, and thus much worse than plain sugar).Next would be eliminating wheat flour and products made from it. Wheat flour ismostly amylopectin A, the form of starch that is most rapidly digested intoglucose. It is also ground into an extremely fine powder, which allows it to bedigested very quickly, since the surface-to-volume ratio is so high.FIBERNext is increasing the amount of fiber in the diet. Green leafy vegetables,fruits, legumes (beans, peas, lentils), cruciferous vegetables such as broccoliand cauliflower, carrots, artichokes, and nuts are excellent sources. Ingeneral, the darker the produce, the more fiber is in it. Lower down on the listare sweet potatoes, and then russet and red potatoes. These are better if theyare eaten cold, after a night in the refrigerator to allow the amylose starch tocrystallize and become resistant starch, which acts like fiber.You can add oat bran to recipes to increase the fiber content, as well as konjacpowder, psyllium powder, or other pure fiber additives.When eating fiber, remember to get lots of water with it. Much of the benefit offiber is that it retains water and stays in the stomach longer, satisfyinghunger and trickling the food through the digestive tract so blood sugar doesn’tspike.WATERStaying hydrated (getting lots of water) helps in several ways. It fills thestomach, relieving hunger. But since humans have a difficult time determiningwhether they are hungry or thirsty, they will often eat when they should bedrinking. Drinking water instead of eating something when you think you arehungry is a good way to avoid getting calories when you aren’t hungry. Eatingwhen you aren’t hungry is a common route to obesity.These three diet interventions—eliminate sugar and flour, greatly increasefiber, get enough water—are the most important. The interventions that follow,while they each have measurable effects, are much less efficient at helping youlose weight. Don’t count on magic ingredients to make you thin. That said, thisbook is about all the many contributing factors, and each little bit can help.CALCIUMThere is an inverse association between dietary calcium intake and obesity.People who are deficient in calcium are more likely to be obese (Astrup 2008).Test subjects taking a gram of calcium per day were 11 percent less likely togain weight than subjects taking placebos. Dairy calcium is even better thanthat in pills. It binds to fat, so some of the ingested fat is not digested andgets flushed down the toilet. Levels of fat in the blood after a meal are lowerif there is sufficient calcium.A lack of calcium makes people hungry for calcium-rich foods. This makes itharder to stick to a reduced-calorie diet.CURCUMINImage [images/201.jpg]Curcumin, known to chemists as diferuloylmethane, is the yellow dye in the spiceturmeric. Curcumin reduces obesity-related inflammation by preventing the fatcells from producing inflammatory molecules (J. Kang et al. 2010). It is thoseinflammatory molecules that cause insulin resistance. This is how curcumin helpsin the treatment of diabetes, apart from its role in reducing fat.A problem with research involving curcumin has recently come to light (Baker2017). Many of the tests done to detect whether a drug or other molecule has abiological effect involve using fluorescent assays. These tests detect the lightemitted by fluorescent molecules used to track the chemistry going on. Butcurcumin itself is fluorescent, and this can cause false positive indicationsfrom the test. So the studies in the following paragraphs need my cautionarylanguage, since they have not yet been evaluated to see if they are affected bythis problem. Where there is no cautionary language, the effect is known to bereal.Curcumin may interact with certain specific proteins in fat cells, pancreaticcells, muscle cells, liver cells, and the immune cells called macrophages. Inthose cells, it may suppress the protein transcription factor nuclearfactor-kappa B, which controls the transcription of DNA and the production ofimmune cell signaling proteins (cytokines), and determines cell survival. It mayalso suppress STAT-3 (signal transducers and activator of transcription 3), theprotein that allows cells to respond to inflammatory cytokines like theinterferons and interleukin-5 and interleukin-6. Curcumin could suppress theWnt/beta-catenin protein that regulates step cells and determines how andwhether they become specialized cells such as fat cells (Shehzad et al. 2011).Curcumin’s effects are not limited to proteins. It may activate the peroxisomeproliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma), a receptor on the surface offat cells that controls their proliferation, their uptake of fats from theblood, and their production of new fat. This activation helps to clear the bloodof fats and glucose, reducing high blood sugar levels and high cholesterollevels.Curcumin could also activate nuclear factor-like 2 (Nrf2), a transcriptionfactor that regulates the production of antioxidant molecules and protectsagainst oxidative damage to cells caused by injury or inflammation.Curcumin reduces levels of leptin and the inflammatory adipose-derived hormoneresistin, both of which are produced by fat cells (Shehzad et al. 2011).Resistin increases levels of the bad form of cholesterol (LDL), and degradesliver receptors of LDL, making it harder for the liver to clear the blood of badcholesterol. Resistin accelerates the formation of atherosclerosis, contributingto heart disease.Curcumin increases levels of adiponectin, the hormone that slows glucoseproduction, burns fat, decreases inflammation, and increases sensitivity toinsulin.Curcumin is thus a safe and inexpensive way to help control obesity and many ofthe obesity-related metabolic diseases. Including lots of curcumin or turmericin the diet is a cheap way to protect yourself from many of these problems.CAPSAICINImage [images/202.jpg]In people with functioning beige fat, capsaicin and capsinoids have been foundto activate brown and beige fat to burn calories for heat (Saito and Yoneshiro2013). Nerves connecting the gut to the brain (the vagus nerve) control whetherfat is deposited under the skin or centrally around the organs (abdominal fat).Capsaicin stops the stimulation of the vagus nerve caused by cholecystokinin andenhances expression of adiponectin and its receptor (Leung 2014).Consumption of foods containing capsaicin is associated with reduced occurrenceof obesity. In rural Thailand, people eat a diet that contains 0.014 percentcapsaicin. When rats were fed that much, they did not eat less, but theirvisceral fat dropped by as much as 29 percent (Leung 2008). This occurs becausethe vagus nerve increases blood flow to the intestines and decreases blood flowto visceral fat deposits. This speeds digestion but inhibits fat formation.Capsaicin also improves the rate at which fat is broken down (lipolysis) afterexercise, and it increases satiety after a meal, while decreasing fat intake.After taking a capsule containing 2.56 milligrams of capsaicin per meal (1.03grams of red chili pepper, 39,050 Scoville heat units), subjects had nodiet-induced thermogenesis drop; they burned the same energy, despite getting 25percent fewer calories while dieting (Janssens et al. 2013). These subjects alsoburned more fat.Capsaicin inhibits macrophage responses to the signal from fat cells, reducingobesity-related inflammation (J. Kang et al. 2010). It also reduces inflammationin the liver, preventing fatty liver disease.You may not even need to eat capsaicin to get the benefits. Topical applicationof a capsaicin cream to mice limited fat accumulation, reduced inflammation, andincreased insulin sensitivity (G. Lee et al. 2013). Such creams are sold overthe counter for relief of arthritis pain.Sweet peppers (Capsicum annum) have a similar molecule, called capsiate, whichhas the same effects as capsaicin but without the hot pungency.Capsaicin is also good for your heart. It stimulates the blood vessels torelease nitric oxide, which makes them widen, lowering blood pressure (McCarty,DiNicolantonio, and O’Keefe 2015). It also has protective antioxidant effects inblood vessels and the liver and reduces atherosclerosis, metabolic syndrome,diabetes, fatty liver disease, cardiac hypertrophy, and stroke risk.Black pepper and ginger have different but similar molecules, and have some, butnot all, of the effects of capsaicin.GARLIC AND ONIONSGarlic contains biologically active compounds that affect both fat tissue andthe tissues in the body that burn fat for heat, such as brown fat, and cells inthe liver, muscles, and white fat (M. Lee et al. 2011). Garlic also affectsgenes associated with the storage of fat in fat cells. One study looked atsupplementing the diet of mice with 2 or 5 percent garlic (as a percentage ofthe total weight of food). For a human, a 600-gram meal would thus have to have12 to 30 grams (one ounce) of garlic. For every meal.For many people that sounds like heaven, but it might not for those in thecarpool the next morning. Fortunately for them, onions have many of the samecompounds in them, and a 5 percent onion diet is not that different from mealswe are used to eating. A study of diabetic obese rats found that a 3 to 5percent onion diet led to lower blood glucose levels, lower insulin resistance,and lower fats and cholesterol in the blood (Yoshinari, Shiojima, and Igarashi2012).Image [images/204-1.jpg]S-methyl-L-cysteineImage [images/204-2.jpg]CycloalliinThat study used two specific sulfur-containing molecules found in onions,S-methyl-L-cysteine and cycloalliin, shown above, along with six similarsulfur-containing molecules, all found in onions. The rats eating the onionextract lost weight, and in particular lost weight in the liver, where obeserats store fat, as humans with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease do. The diabeticrats improved their glucose tolerance, apparently due to reduced levels of fattyacids in the blood and muscles, and thus lowered their insulin resistance. Theeffects were dose dependent, with greater effects seen at higher dosages.Another study looked into non-sulfur-containing molecules found in onion peeltea. Most of us throw away the peel of the onion, but it contains catechins,biologically active compounds that have many health benefits. One such catechinis the flavonoid quercetin, shown below.Like the sulfur-containing compounds, quercetin regulates fat metabolism andsuppresses high blood sugar levels. Flavonoids and polyphenols are found in manyplant foods and have many health benefits, such as antioxidant effects,anti-inflammatory effects, and fat-regulating effects. Onions are one of thefoods in our diet that are richest in flavonoids.Image [images/205.jpg]The rats in the study were given 5 percent of their diet in onion peel tea. Thisamounted to between 5 and 6 milligrams per kilogram of body weight, which for a180-pound human would mean less than half a gram (408 milligrams) per day. Therats lost weight and fat mass and had lower levels of leptin as a result.GREEN TEA AND GRAPE SEEDPhenolic compounds such as epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), resveratrol,quercetin, and kaempferol inhibit pancreatic lipase (Sergent et al. 2012). Rutinand o-coumaric acid were found to be effective at reducing obesity in rats fed ahigh-fat diet (Hsu et al. 2008) in doses of 100 milligrams per kilogram of bodyweight. For a 180-pound man, that would come to 8.2 grams per day.EGCG and other catechins have been shown to reduce fat cell proliferation andfat production; reduce fat mass, body weight, and fat absorption in the gut;lower blood triglycerides, free fatty acids, and cholesterol; lower bloodglucose, insulin, and leptin levels; and increase thermogenesis, the burning offat to provide body heat (Wolfram, Wang, and Thielecke 2006). That’s quite a lotof benefit from some fairly simple molecules. The structure of EGCG is shown tothe right.Image [images/206-1.jpg]You can simply drink green tea, or you can buy it in concentrated form incapsules as a supplement, often sold as “fat burner” pills. These contain lotsof EGCG, along with a coffee cup’s worth of caffeine. Together the two moleculesreduce hunger, as well as having all the above effects, and this makes fastingeasier, should you be trying that as well.Grape seed and skin extract, as well as grape seed oil, contain catechins. Thesehave been found to have antiobesity and several cardioprotective effects,reducing inflammation, enlarged heart, and levels of C-reactive protein, amarker of inflammation (Charradi et al. 2011). The oil of Muscadine grape seedswas studied for its benefits in reducing fat production and inflammation (L.Zhao et al. 2015). It is a source of a type of vitamin E called tocotrienols. Ithas been found to reduce the expression of genes and proteins required to makefat.BERBERINEImage [images/206-2.jpg]Berberine is another yellow plant dye, like curcumin. Like caffeine, ephedrine,morphine, cocaine, nicotine, strychnine, mescaline, and dopamine, it is analkaloid (a ring molecule containing a nitrogen atom, shown in blue in thestructural formula shown above).Berberine is found in many different plants. It gives the yellow color to treeturmeric (Berberis aristata) bark and roots, and is found in other barberryspecies (e.g., Berberis vulgaris), as well as California poppies, Oregon grape,goldenseal, and yellowroot. It has a bitter taste, like most alkaloids.Berberine is antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral, and is used as a topicalanti-infective. It is rapidly digested, making it less effective for thesepurposes when eaten. However, its metabolites (breakdown products) arebiologically active and are the components that give it anti-inflammatory,antiobesity, and antidiabetes properties. It also lowers blood pressure and actsas an anticonvulsant and a mild sedative. It lowers blood triglycerides andtotal cholesterol and increases insulin sensitivity by 50 percent (J. Yin, Xing,and Ye 2008). Like most brightly colored plant extracts, it is an antioxidant;the same chemical properties that give these substances their color makes themgood antioxidants.Berberine works to control obesity and diabetes by stimulating production of, orreducing the enzymatic destruction of, the incretin glucagon-like polypeptide 1(GLP-1, see the section on hormones, page 112 [008_Chapter05.xhtml#page_112]).This hormone increases insulin levels, decreases glucagon levels, and inhibitsan enzyme that inhibits the insulin receptors in muscle and fat cells, thusincreasing insulin sensitivity. Berberine also increases the burning of fattyacids and increases the number of insulin receptors in fat and muscle cells.Because it is rapidly digested and cleared from the blood, it is given infrequent doses: 500 milligrams three times a day, preferably just after a meal.A three-month study of 36 diabetic patients comparing berberine to theantidiabetes drug metformin found that it had similar effects to that drug onfasting blood glucose levels, hemoglobin A1c, insulin sensitivity, and bloodtriglycerides (J. Yin, Xing, and Ye 2008). In the latter (blood fats andcholesterol) it worked better than metformin. Waist measurements andwaist-to-hip ratio both declined.Small studies for three months can’t tell us much about the safety of a drug orherbal supplement. There may be unknown long-term effects on bones, pancreas, orliver cells, or harmful interactions with gut microbes. There is some evidencethat berberine causes the liver to be less effective at clearing some drugs fromthe system. And, of course, herbal supplements are unregulated in the UnitedStates, so you can’t really know if you are actually getting what you paid for.Drugs like metformin, on the other hand, have been subject to extensivelong-term studies of their safety and effectiveness and are regulated.VINEGARImage [images/208.jpg]Taking vinegar with food has long been known to reduce blood sugar after a meal.In the 1820s, Lord Byron ate a fad diet of potatoes drenched in vinegar to wardoff obesity (he may have been anorexic). The active ingredient in vinegar isacetic acid, shown to the right.Fad diets aside, modern research into vinegar’s antiglycemic properties bear itout (Johnston et al. 2010). Two tablespoons of vinegar (in a glass of water)taken during a carbohydrate meal (bagel or glucose) reduced blood sugar readingsafter the meal, compared to subjects taking no vinegar. The acidic form ofvinegar (acetic acid) was required. Nonacidic sodium salts of acetic acid(sodium acetate) did not have any effect, thus showing that the effect was notsimply due to the hormonal effects of acetate ions, which we saw earlier whenlooking at gut microbe activity (page 122 [008_Chapter05.xhtml#page_122]).Reminiscent of Lord Byron’s diet of vinegar-soaked potatoes, one study on coldboiled potatoes with vinegar dressing found lower blood sugar levels and lowerinsulin levels after the meal (Leeman, Östman, and Björck 2005). Storing thepotatoes in the refrigerator overnight allowed the amylose to crystallize intoresistant starch. The vinegar slowed the digestion of the remaining starch.Vinegar has been shown to slow the emptying of the stomach. This may be one ofits mechanisms for reducing blood sugar levels, since it gives the carbohydratestime to be slowly digested and absorbed, without spiking blood sugar or insulinlevels.Vinegar also increases the satiety of a carbohydrate meal (Östman et al. 2005),in addition to reducing its effects on blood sugar and insulin. All theseeffects scaled in a linear fashion with how much vinegar was consumed with themeal: twice as much vinegar gave twice as much effect (up to the amounts tested,i.e., 30 milliliters [1 ounce] of white vinegar). Not only did vinegar increasesatiety, it prolonged satiety, more than doubling it after two hours.The effects of vinegar are similar to the effects of eating a low glycemic indexmeal compared to a high glycemic index meal. What vinegar seems to do is makethose bad starches act more like a low glycemic index meal. This also means thatif you are already eating low-carbohydrate meals, or low glycemic index meals,vinegar may not provide any benefit.If you must eat that French bread at the restaurant, soak it in balsamicvinegar. But order the salad, with a vinaigrette dressing, and take your timeenjoying the meal.Vinegar not only reduces blood sugar and insulin during a meal, it also reducesinsulin resistance (Johnston, Kim, and Buller 2004). That paper compared itseffects to the prescription antidiabetes drug metformin. Vinegar interferes withan enzyme the body uses to digest disaccharides (sugars made up of two simplesugars) that result from the breakdown of starches. It also affects glucosemetabolism in muscles, helping to reduce blood sugar levels and improvesensitivity to insulin. Similar results are found with other carbohydratesbesides wheat, such as white rice, eaten either with vinegar or vinegar-pickledcucumber (Östman et al. 2005).OTHER DIETARY CONSIDERATIONSSince overweight and obese people tend to underestimate how much they eat(Vliet-Ostaptchouk et al. 2008), just knowing this is the case and adjustingyour estimate of calories or portion size can help you diet. If I always think1,000 calories is 500, I can mentally double my estimate and think twice abouthow much I put on a plate.EXERCISEExercise alone has been shown to convert fat-storing white fat intoenergy-burning beige fat. But exercising in temperatures around 60°F activatesexisting brown fat, raising metabolic rate and burning calories to produce heat.Of course, exercising burns calories while you are doing it. Because ofhomeostasis mechanisms, this effect is tempered when the body reduces metabolicrate after the exercise to maintain body fat.Exercise that builds muscle mass increases metabolic rate because all that newmuscle needs to burn calories in order to live. Thus, building muscle raisesmetabolic rate permanently, while exercise that does not build muscle onlyincreases metabolic rate while we are exercising.Exercise relieves stress. Stress releases cortisol, which promotes fat storage.Exercise also reduces depression, which often contributes to obesity. Exercisesuppresses appetite and helps you sleep better. All these benefits help you whenyou are trying to lose weight.In one study specifically looking at chronic inflammation due to obesity, it wasfound that aerobic and resistance exercise reduces chronic inflammation in obesesubjects (You et al. 2013). Besides its many impacts on general health, chronicinflammation also worsens obesity. Muscle cells produce anti-inflammatorymolecules when they are exercised.DRUGS * Caffeine: Caffeine consumption raises adiponectin levels in the blood, reducing blood cholesterol levels and improving glucose metabolism. At the same time, it reduces leptin levels, and this reduces inflammation and blood triglycerides. It lowers the risk of type 2 diabetes and raises the levels of the good high-density lipoproteins (HDL) (Yamashita et al. 2012). * Aspirin: Taking 600 milligrams of aspirin has been shown to be effective in reducing obesity-induced colon cancer rates (Movahedi et al. 2015). Aspirin is an anti-inflammatory, and inflammation exacerbates obesity. * Metformin: The antidiabetes drug metformin has shown some mild weight-loss effects and helped some subjects keep from regaining weight. The effects were small, however. * Ephedrine: Ephedrine is a stimulant whose use in weight loss has become illegal in the United States due to concern over its side effects. It has been shown to stimulate brown fat in mice, but in humans, chronic use actually reduces brown fat activity, despite being effective at reducing levels of white fat (Carey et al. 2015). In lean men, it activates brown fat, but in obese men, it does not (Carey et al. 2013). It slows the emptying of the stomach, which reduces hunger and slows down glucose uptake from carbohydrates. It is synergistic with caffeine and aspirin, meaning that the combination works better than any of the three drugs alone. As a drug, it is related to methamphetamine and can be used in the illicit manufacture of that illegal drug. Because of this, its availability is tightly regulated in the United States. * Thiazolidinediones: These are drugs used in the treatment of diabetes. They activate brown fat, which burns calories to produce heat. They cause the body to store fatty acids in fat cells, causing a shortage of fatty acids in the blood, which causes an increase in the burning of glucose as the alternative fuel. They remove the fatty acids in the muscles that cause insulin resistance. They also reduce leptin, causing increased appetite, but they increase adiponectin, thus slowing the release of glucose from the liver. Unfortunately, most of these drugs have been removed from the market due to dangerous side effects. * Mirabegron: This is a drug used to treat overactive bladder. It has been found to activate brown fat, in a similar way to how exposure to cold does. * Orlistat: This is a prescription drug that prevents dietary fats from being absorbed during digestion. The effects are modest.HORMONE THERAPYVery few people have the rare genetic variants that disable the leptin or POMCsystems. But for those who do, daily injections of recombinant leptin (orsynthetic molecules that stimulate melanocortin-4 receptors) have effectivelycured the syndrome, much as insulin injections have kept type 1 diabetics alive.Thyroid hormones are also available for people with obesity due tohypothyroidism. But typically, changes in weight after treatment forhypothyroidism are modest. Thyroid deficiency is not often a contributing factorin obesity. Thyroid hormone levels already rise every time you eat, andhypothyroid condition is often caused by obesity (not the other way around) andgoes away when the weight is lost (Longhi and Radetti 2013).On the other hand, people being treated for hyperthyroid condition usually gainnontrivial amounts of weight. Thyroid hormone increases appetite, and peoplewith hyperthyroidism are used to being able to eat large amounts of fatteningfoods without consequence, since they burn calories at a high rate.Thyroid hormone therapy is not a safe or effective way to lose weight (Kaptein,Beale, and Chan 2009).We discussed oxytocin in the chapter on hormones (page 120[008_Chapter05.xhtml#page_120]). Oxytocin nasal spray is available for purchasein online pharmacies and on Amazon.REDUCING CHRONIC INFLAMMATIONObesity causes chronic inflammation, and inflammation causes obesity. Reducinginflammation not only provides health benefits throughout the body, but it helpsto reduce obesity.There are many anti-inflammatory foods, and we have covered many of themalready. We have also briefly mentioned aspirin as an anti-inflammatory aid, aswell as the known anti-inflammatory effects of regular exercise.Inflammation requires inflammatory molecules called eicosanoids. These are madefrom the fatty acid arachidonic acid (AA). The body makes arachidonic acid fromlinoleic acid in the diet. Up until about 50 years ago, the human diet hadlittle linoleic acid in it. Traditional fats like lard, butter, and olive oilhave less than 10 percent linoleic acid. But with the production of vegetableoils such as corn, soy, sunflower, and safflower oil, the linoleic acid contenthas risen to 50 percent and sometimes to 75 percent. These are inflammatoryfoods, and they are the cheapest source of fat, meaning that they are what goesinto almost all processed food.The other cheap source of calories is starch, particularly the high glycemicindex starches found in wheat flour, rice, and potatoes. Insulin stronglyactivates key enzymes in the conversion of linoleic acid into inflammatoryarachidonic acid. With sugar and starchy foods spiking insulin levels, and seedoils causing inflammation, our diet has evolved into one that promotes obesity.Only the genetically lucky few can eat these foods and stay lean.Fighting inflammation with anti-inflammatory omega-3 oils, polyphenols, andplant pigments and reducing inflammatory oil consumption can go a long way toreducing or eliminating chronic inflammation. The omega-3 oil eicosapentaenoicacid (EPA) competes with arachidonic acid (AA) in cell membranes, preventing AAfrom being converted into inflammatory eicosanoids. It also inhibits one of theenzymes needed for the conversion of linoleic acid into arachidonic acid. EPAand another omega-3 oil, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), activate genes that causefat burning, thus reducing inflammatory blood fats (Sears and Ricordi 2010).These omega-3 oils are cheaper and safer than anti-inflammatory drugs such asaspirin and steroids. Many anti-inflammatory drugs work by preventing theconversion of AA into eicosanoids. Reducing AA and linoleic acid in the diet canhave the same effects.The two markers of inflammation are levels of C-reactive protein and the ratioof AA to EPA in the blood. If we lower the AA/EPA ratio by reducing AA andraising EPA, we will reduce inflammation and thus reduce C-reactive proteinlevels.PSYCHOLOGICAL REMEDIESDon’t eat when you aren’t hungry.If you find yourself staring into an open refrigerator wondering what you wantto eat, consider an apple or a carrot. If those do not appeal to you, you maynot actually be hungry. You may be eating out of boredom, or looking forpleasure. Try going outside for a walk instead, or doing something else for fun,something that does not involve eating.LIFESTYLE REMEDIESGet more exercise. Find fun things to do that involve moving around, insituations away from food. Take a walk, ride a bike, play a sport, play with thedog, or do some gardening. There are lots of ways to have fun that involvemoving parts of your body besides your jaw muscles.Skip a meal. Or three or four. A day of fasting once a week can help you lose apound a week. Do that for a year and you’ve lost 50 pounds.Don’t eat between meals. Give your body a few hours of low insulin levels to getback your insulin sensitivity. If you feel hungry, drink some water, coffee,tea, or thin broth. Change your attitude toward feeling hungry. Feeling hungrymeans you are making progress on losing weight. It makes the meal that followsall the more enjoyable.Allow time for your body to realize you have eaten enough. Bolting a meal downin 15 minutes allows you to eat far more food than it takes to cure your hunger.It is what leads to a feeling of being overstuffed once your body has had timeto register the amount of food that has just been dumped into it. Foods thattake time to eat, such as most high-fiber foods (carrots, an apple, etc.), willslow you down at the table. Don’t have second helpings until at least 20 minuteshave gone by.Keep high-fiber foods available and in plain sight, such as a bowl of fruit onthe counter near the refrigerator. Get used to going to the fruit or vegetabledrawer instead of to the other parts of the refrigerator.Control portion size when you eat. Don’t bring the whole pot to the table. Servethe food on plates in the kitchen and bring the plates to the dining table. Ifthere is a big pile of food on the table, people will mindlessly eat it until itis gone. If they really need second helpings, a trip into the kitchen is not ahardship.If you do want to have a big pile of food on the table, make it the high-fibervegetables and salad. The meat, cheese, eggs, and starch are served on theplates and returned to the kitchen, and anyone who is still hungry will reachfor the veggies and salad before they get up and run to the kitchen for anotherpork chop.Don’t bring sugar into the house. Don’t allow the nondieters to bring it homeeither. They can find plenty of it elsewhere. When your sugar addiction has yourunning to the freezer for that pint of Ben & Jerry’s, you will have to decidewhether the drive to the store is really worth it.Keep a food log. Some people like to take photos of everything they eat as a wayof keeping track. Knowing how much you have eaten today, and what type of foodit was, allows you to keep yourself honest.Control inflammation by taking a baby aspirin every day (81 milligrams) and bygetting lots of colorful produce—that is how you know it containsantioxidants—and omega-3 fats, such as krill oil capsules.Reduce stress by trying meditation or yoga. Exercise is also a great stressreliever. If there are stress-inducing parts of your life that you can dowithout, get rid of them.SOCIAL REMEDIESDo you overeat in social situations, like at a party or at the movies? Partiesoften provide lots of calorie-dense foods that stimulate the reward centers ofyour brain, even when you aren’t hungry. The wide variety of foods at partiesencourages overconsumption. We might get tired of eating one type of food, butwhen there are many different tastes available, we will continue to eat, longafter we have stuffed ourselves.To counter this, consider a decision not to eat anything at all at the party.Hold a glass of water in your hand and take a sip whenever you are tempted tograb a handful of chips or candy. If the party isn’t fun without overeating, youare going to the wrong parties. Explain to people that you are planning not toeat anything, so they will help you with your willpower. If they don’t help, ortry to talk you out of it, they are not the kind of people you want to be aroundwhen you are trying to lose weight.At the movies, simply avoid the concession stand. You will save a lot of money.If your only reason for going to the movie was to gorge on popcorn and candy,perhaps a movie is not really your favorite form of entertainment.Many people think that in order to be a good host, they must feed their guests,and feed them party foods instead of healthy fare. But your guests will stillcome over if you explain to them beforehand that food will not be served. Theywill eat before they come or make plans to eat afterward. If you want to hedgeyour bets, have some nuts and bowls of fruit set around. Those who are genuinelyhungry will have something healthy to eat. If an apple doesn’t make them happy,they weren’t actually hungry.At social gatherings, people tend to eat mindlessly, simply because there isfood within easy reach everywhere. An engaging conversation or a good moviemakes people forget that they aren’t really hungry. If the food isn’t around,they won’t eat, and they won’t miss it.If the gathering is actually about food, bring the food to a table from thekitchen, where it was out of sight. When the meal is finished, remove the food,or move the gathering away from the food, so people don’t continuously grazemindlessly. Instead of having snacks placed everywhere to eat before the meal,plan to have the meal soon after people arrive, and move away from the table, ormove the food, when the meal is over. Plan to have enough food to appeasehunger, and no more, so there isn’t a lot of food lying around when people areno longer hungry.VICIOUS CIRCLESThroughout this book, I have mentioned harmful positive feedback effects, wherebeing in a particular state, such as obesity, has effects on other systems inthe body that then feed back and amplify the original problem. Here is a list ofthose “vicious circles”: * Obesity causes poor sleep and poor sleep causes obesity. * Visceral fat reduces growth hormone, leading to more visceral fat. * Since obesity causes insulin resistance, and insulin resistance causes leptin resistance, once we become obese, we are always hungry and become more obese. * Stress may cause obesity, which causes more stress. * High-sugar, high-fat diet increases Firmicutes bacteria in the gut, leading to increased energy absorption, exacerbating the weight gain from the poor diet. * Obese mothers program their fetuses to become obese, producing a new generation of obese mothers. * Fat cells cause autoimmune attacks on the thyroid gland, reducing thyroid hormones, further contributing to obesity. * A high-fat diet causes the intestinal K cells that produce the hormone GIP to grow and proliferate. GIP allows fat cells to take up fatty acids and get fatter. * Depression can lead to overeating and weight gain, and obesity can lead to depression. * Western diet increases fat-inducing bacteria that produce toxic DCA, which kills other bacteria, allowing the fat-inducing ones to take over. * Inflammation increases AGRP, which increases inflammation."},{"pageContent":"BIBLIOGRAPHYAbraham, S.
