GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 3 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 INTRODUCTION This is the story of a woman named Rene Caisse. For more than 50 years, until her death in 1978 at the age of 90, she treated t housands of cancer patients, most of them written off by doctors as terminally ill, w ith her own secret herbal formula. She called it Essiac—Caisse spelled backwards—a nd she brewed the tea herself, alone in her kitchen. Her patients swore by her. They were devoted. Men and women who believed she cured them of cancer told their friends a nd families, wrote letters to doctors and politicians, swore affidavits, testified be fore the Canadian parliament and pleaded with Rene Caisse to supply them with more Essiac when they needed it. Some husbands and wives of patients who died wrote Rene letters thanking her profoundly for making life easier—free of pain—and l onger for their loved ones. Her funeral in the village of Bracebridge, about 170 kilome ters north of Toronto, was attended by hundreds of people, including former patient s Rene had treated for terminal cancer as far back as the 1930s and who were still on their feet to bury her and tell their stories. I'm convinced that Essiac works. It ha s potent healing—and preventive—power. It is a gift from nature. I've seen a small part of the evidence with my own eyes, and I've experienced Essiac's power as a healthful tonic in my own life. I suffered from chronic bronchitis until a few years ago when I first heard of Essiac and tried it myself. Within days my cough disappeared and it hasn't returned. I still drink the Essiac. It tastes like what it is, an herbal tea. About as plain and mild as any of the other herbal teas from around the world you can buy in any supermarket. I've never felt better. All through Canada and in parts of the United States to day there are people of all ages who are absolutely convinc ed that Essiac saved their lives or the lives of friends and loved ones. But you can't buy it in any supermarket. Claims have been made—since about 1925, in fact—that Essiac is an effective treatment for cancer. So the governments of North America have classified it as a \"drug.\" The Canadian government almost legalized its use by Rene in 1939, and has gone through fits and starts ever since in deciding how to handle the situation. The policy has ranged from threatening to arrest Rene if she didn't close her clinic to promising her publicly—on the record, in the press that she wouldn't be arrested if she would agree to keep her clinic open, t hus quieting the public clamor that arose after the government threatened to shut her down. In the last decade, the Canadian gove rnment has classified Essiac as an \"experimental drug,\" and then an \"experi mental drug\" that had failed to show promise, and today—as Dr. Hendrick's letter shows—the internal battles are still going on in Canada over the future of Essiac. In the U.S., a 1978 class action suit in federal court in Detroit seeking to authorize the importation of Essiac for cancer tr eatment was defeated by the government. Other than that, the U.S. government hasn't faced much pressure about Essiac. There are probably high level officials in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration—and the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 4 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 National Cancer Institute—who make lif e and death decisions about cancer drugs who could honestly say they've never heard of Essiac. I hope they'll take the time to read this book. I don't claim that Essiac is a miraculous pa nacea, capable of curing all cancers in all people, nor do I believe that. Rene Caisse didn't even believe that. She didn't claim Essiac as a \"cure for cancer.\" Her former patients were the ones who put forward that claim, strenuously and over many d ecades. What Rene maintained was that Essiac caused regression in some cancerous tumors, the total destruction of others, prolonged life in most cases and—in virtua lly every case—significantly diminished the pain and suffering of cancer patients. If the testimonials of Rene's former pa tients, including those sworn under oath, have any credibility at all—and when I presen t them, I think you'll agree they do—then Essiac's powers as a pain reliever in cancer patients are nothing short of phenomenal. In sixty years of persona l accounts, the easing of agony and an increased sense of well-being—often to th e point of getting through the day without narcotics—is one of the predominant them es. You hear it over and over again, and always told with a deep sense of gratitude. Rene fought almost her whole adult life against overwhelming odds and under incredible pressures, some of them self imposed, to establish those simple facts as accepted wisdom. She never gave up her fight. But for one woman many years ago to persuade the medical and legal institu tions of North America that a natural treatment for cancer—based on herbs that gr ow wild—might make more sense than the accepted means of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy...she might as well have been telling them in an earlier century that the earth is round. Remember: Rene was fighting cancer with a natural treatment in an era when the conventional wisdom of the medical establis hment denied even that diet might be a factor in causing cancer. It's hard to believe, knowing what we know now—and what has become the conventional wisdom —but for generations those doctors who preached dietary causes of cancer were dismissed by most physicians as quacks. So what was the medical establishment to make of this woman—who wasn't even a licensed doctor—who preached that a cancer treatment was to be found in plants that grow wild? My goal in this book is simple: I want to tell the story of this ordinary woman's extraordinary Life and share the knowledge of Essiac so that people can make their own informed decisions about what it's futu re should be. I don't pretend to have all the answers about how and why Essiac works, or the final scientific proof that it does. There are large gaps, as I'll explai n, in my own knowledge of this story. Much of it remains a mystery to me, raising d eeply intriguing questions which I would love to see answered. But I do know that there is already enough evidence that Essiac has benefited cancer patients in the last 60 years to warrant t hose controlled clinical studies that some physicians—such as Dr. Hendrick—have advocated for decades. The risk to the public would certainly a ppear to be minimal. There seems to be universal agreement among the doctors and scientists who have done investigations of Essiac—and the patients who have used it—that Essiac is non-toxic and without harmful side effects. Rene Caisse drank it every day for half a century and some of her family and close friends always made sure they had their daily cup. Not even"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 5 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 Rene Caisse's worst enemies ever put fo rward the argument that people were hurt by drinking the tea. This nontoxic nature of Essiac is an impor tant consideration in making it a treatment worthy of serious investigation. Many of the conventionally accepted chemotherapy drugs actually come with toxic warning labels. One of the commonly administered cancer drugs is the chemical Fluorourac il {5 FU). Note this warning on the manufacturer's brochure: \"Precautions: Fluor ouracil is a highly toxic drug with a narrow margin of safety. Therefore, patien ts should be carefully supervised since therapeutic response is unlikely to occur without some evidence of toxicity...Severe hematological toxicity, gastrointestinal he morrhage and even death may result from the fluorouracil despite meticulous select ion of patients and car eful adjustment of dosage.\" As if that weren't bad enough, the offi cially accepted \"experimental drugs,\" on which the government and the drug companie s lavish huge sums of developmental funds, can be even worse. According to a 1981 Washington Post story, a major American drug company spent significant amounts of money and years of research on a weed from India they hoped would have a beneficial effect on certain forms of leukemia—even though it was known in advanc e that the weed caused severe liver damage in livestock. And sure enough, wh en the weed was synthesized into a chemical and given to cancer patients, there were reports that it was helping some people—and killing others. But there was nothing unusual in that. \"We knew from the beginning that this caused toxicity in animals,\" the Post quoted a U.S. Food and Drug Administration official as saying. \"Almost all investigational ca ncer drugs are highly toxic.\" As you read this story and wonder—as I did many, many times while I was researching it—if an herbal compound developed by one woman could possibly—even possibly—be safer and more effective than the best of what medical science is already bringing us, please keep this quote in mind from th at same 1981 series of Washington Post articles: \"Over The last decade, more than 150 exper imental drugs have been given to tens of thousands of cancer patients under the sponsorship of the US Federal Government's National Cancer Institute. Many of these dr ugs have come from a list of highly toxic industrial chemicals, including pesticides, herbicides and dyes...While all anti-cancer drugs can cause side effects among some of those who take them, the experimental drugs—along with leading to hundreds of deaths—have elicited a nightmarish list of serious adverse reacti ons, including kidney failure, liver failure, heart failure, respiratory distress, dest ruction of bone marrow so the body can no longer make blood, brain damage, para lysis, seizure, coma, and visual hallucinations. \"So little is known about many of these ch emicals that doctors have found these ironic results: In some cases the experimental drug actually stimulated tumor growth rather than stopped the cancer—and in other tests, doctors and researchers found that the experimental drug itself caused cancer.\" Rene Caisse wouldn't have been surprised to read that. Her own feelings about the use of these toxic drugs, af ter a lifetime spent fighting cancer, were blunt and nasty: \"Chemotherapy should be a criminal offense,\" she told one reporter. Though the medical establishment has not yet recognized Rene Caisse's herbal"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 6 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 treatment for cancer as legitimate, there is more than ample precedent for the approach she was taking. According to a 1987 NOVA documentary on \"The Hidden Power of Plants \", aired on the Public Broadcasting System: \"Indeed, the history of medicine has been largely the story of pl ants and the potent chemicals they produce. Around the world, traditional healers, using pl ant medications, provide health care to eighty percent of the human popul ation—over four billion people.\" Since the 1950s doctors have been using an alkaloid called vincristine—which comes from an evergreen plant known as the periwinkle—in the treatment of childhood leukemia and other cancers. Digitalis , which comes from the leaves of the foxglove plant, is an important he art medication. According to the NOVA documentary, \"Over 25 Percent of the drugs prescribed in the U.S. still contain plant materials as their principal active ingredients.\" Throughout history there are countless exam ples of people discovering the healing properties of nature before science could understand them—or even believe that they existed. South American Indians treated feve rs, especially malarial fevers, with an herbal tea made from cinchona bark. Scient ists eventually discovered that cinchona bark is nature's source of quinine. Science didn't discover that Vitamin C pr evented scurvy. English sailors discovered that without even knowing it. All they knew was that they'd better take some citrus fruits—lemons, limes along with them on long ocean voyages. That's why the English came to be called \"limeys.\" Science didn't discover Vitamin C until 1932. For centuries, American Indi ans treated various aches and pains with an herbal tea made from white willow bark. It must have seemed terribly primitive to the doctors who first heard of it. They were trusting their science; the Indians were trusting nature. But eventually science caught up. Today, synthesized and refined white willow bark is the basis for what we call aspirin. Always, in all cultures, there was what might be called \"living proof—medicinal value of plants long before there was sc ientific proof—and acceptance. Living proof, of course, is not acceptable to the scient ific community. Not even the testimony of ordinary individuals, sworn to oath, meets the rigorous standards of scientific proof. But no matter what happens in the scientific world, livi ng proof will be what passes from person to person and prevents Essi ac from dying out altogether in the modern world. Rene Caisse's files are filled with le tters from people all over North America testifying to lifesaving experiences with Essiac. Almost 404 people showed up at the Canadian Cancer Commission hearings in 1939 prepared to be sworn to oath and state that Essiac saved their lives. Today, all over Canada and in parts of th e U.S., there are thousands of people who may not know the first thing about scie ntific proof, but who know that Essiac benefited or even saved them or someone th ey love. For science to deny that there is a cause and effect relationship between E ssiac and the relief of pain and the regression of cancerous tumors is almost like saying, well, we can see aIl those great huge billowing clouds of smoke, but we ha ven't been able to determine with certainty that there is a fire. While most Americans have never heard of Essiac, the controversy it inspires has raged in Canada since the 1920s, every few years in the public glare of the press,"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 7 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 and frequently involving the highest medical , legal and political circles in Canada. But always that controversy centered on this one woman who lived, most of the time, in the tiny village of Bracebridge, Ontario, population 9,000 or so. Rene Caisse was an unlikely public figure. She was a skilled nurse who didn't crave attention or money. \"I neve r had $100 I could call my ow n,\" she used to laugh with her friends. She didn't charge a fee for her services. She accepted only voluntary contributions in the form of fruits, vegeta bles or eggs, as often as not—from those who could afford to offer them, and she didn't turn away people who couldn't make any payment at all. One man, Ted Hale, was so grateful watc hing his wife recover from cancer using Essiac that he slipped a $50 bill under a book on a shelf when he came to pick up another bottle from Rene. The next time he arrived at her front door, he says, she grabbed him by his shirt collar, pulled him inside and gave him a piece of her mind. How dare he leave her that much money? She didn't like it one bit. He apologized and asked her if she would accept it as his way of donating for the next people who needed her Essiac and couldn't afford to le ave anything at all. She finally relented on those grounds and kept the money, but Ted Hale still laughs at his own embarrassment when he tells the story ten years later. Rene Caisse lived her whole life in modest circumstances while rejecting offers of vast sums of money to reveal her formul a. She refused to reveal her formula to people who wanted to help her; she refu sed to reveal her formula to powerful institutions that demanded it before they would consider legitimizing Essiac. What Rene Caisse wanted was to heal the ill and guarantee the legalization of Essiac for all, yet her intransigent refusal to budge from secrecy about the formula cost her—and us—dearly. She refused to reveal the formula to the Canadian government, the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York—the world's largest private cancer research center—and the National Cancer Institute, just to name some of the institutions that wanted the formula at one time or another. She wouldn't give them the formula until they would admit that E ssiac had merit as a treatment for cancer. They refused to admit any merit until she gave them the formula. There were legitimate arguments made on both sides. Rene was fearful that the medical establishment would either exploit Essiac, charging exorbitant prices to make a fortune and placing it beyond the me ans of the poor, or discredit it and bury it. The doctors and politicians argued that they couldn't very well accept the legitimacy of a cancer treatment if they didn't even know what was in it. The result was a tragic standoff. We have lost decades of precious resear ch. With hindsight, it can be argued that Rene Caisse should have given the formul a to anyone, anywhere, at any time, who wanted to have it for any reason, on the grounds that the more people who have it, the better chance that the truth will out. That certainly will be the position taken in this book. I am going to release to the public, for the first time, the formula and the procedure for preparing Essiac. I will explain in de tail at the end of this book how I will do that, and how anyone who wants that information may have it. I believe that information should be in the hands of the public. People should have"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 8 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 the right to make their own decisions about whether or not they will drink the Essiac tea. People can make it themse lves, if they wish, just the way Rene did. There is no mystery about the preparation. It must be done carefully and accurately—as I will explain—but it finally comes down to: Put in so much of this herb, so much of that herb, brew it and drink the tea. The herbs themselves grow in many regions . Rene used to say that enough of the herbs grow in Ontario to supply the whol e world. But in revealing the formula, I share one of Rene's deep fear s that played an important ro le in her refusal to release the formula until after the governing bodies of medicine and law would admit that it had merit: Namely, that once the herbs ar e publicly identified, these inexpensive and widely available plants will be placed on the federal \"controlled substances\" roster—like some dangerous drug—suddenly become very difficult—and illegal—to acquire. But there's nothing I can do about that. As always, those decisions are up to the governments. But my decision is to tell the story of how I came into possession of the formula, place it before the public a nd let people make up their own minds about what they want to do with it. At least once the formula is in the public domain, the old argument that was used for so long against Rene—we can't do proper scientific studies until we know the formula—w ill no longer have any validity at all. Sloan-Kettering, for instance, was telling Rene Caisse at least as late as 1975 that they would perform more clinical studies on Essiac, if only they had the formula. Well, now they'll have it. And so will anyone who wants it. Rene Caisse was a sweet woman who gave her best and saw the worst. She was surrounded most of her life with the pain and suffering of others. She lived under siege much of the time, w ith a legion of supporters who saw her as a saint and powerful enemies who wanted her arrest ed for practicing medicine without a license. She became so fearful and paranoid about arrest that she sometimes had to turn away dying people who were pleading w ith her to help them. But more often, she found ways to help the people who came to her, even total strangers who had nothing to offer her. She said once about he r situation: \"I was always just one jump ahead of a policeman. We were right across the street from the town jail and the keeper used to joke that he was saving a cell for me.\" The blessing of Essiac brought a curse for Rene Caisse: Her life was never her own. CHAPTER ONE In 1922, Rene Caisse was a 33-year-old su rgical nurse in Haileybury, Ontario. The physicians and surgeons she assisted, by a ll accounts, held her in high esteem. She had established an excellent reputation as a nurse. Her family was prominent in the Braceb ridge area. Her parents were among the local pioneers who had first settled there in the 1870s when that remote part of Canada was opened up by the lumber and fur trapping industries. Rene's father ran the local barber shop a nd was active in civic affairs; her mother was active in church affairs. They raised their 12 children to be good Catholics, and"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 9 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 Rene—the 8 th of 12 remained faithful to the church all her life. The old, fading photographs of the Caisse's and their 12 children posed for portraits show a handsome, well-dressed family. The few photographs that survive of Rene as a young woman in her nursing uniform show he r to be trim and strikingly beautiful, dark haired with shining eyes. Those photographs come as a surprise ev en to people who knew her in the years after she discovered Essiac. At some point early on in those years, she let herself go physically and became terribly overwei ght, well over 200 pounds, and she stayed that way for the rest of her life. But when she was young, Rene Caisse was a real beauty. One day in 1922, Rene was caring for an old woman who had just come out of surgery. The woman's right breast was ba dly scarred. Rene asked the woman what had happened to her. As Rene later de scribed the scene, many times over many years and always the same way, the woman told Rene that she had come from England 30 years earlier to join her hus band, who was prospecting in northern Ontario. Not long after she arrived in Cana da, her right breast had become sore and swollen and painful. An old Indian medici ne man at the mining camp had told her that she had cancer and he could cure it wi th an Indian herbal remedy. He would be happy to give it to her. But instead her husband had taken her to doc tors in Toronto. The doctors told her that she was suffering from advanced can cer, and the breast would have to be removed at once. She didn't want the surg ery. One of her friends had recently died from the same operation, and they couldn't afford the surgery, anyway, so she decided she'd take her chances with the old Indian. When they got back to the mining camp, the Indian gave the woman an herbal tea to drink and told her the ingredients and how to prepare it so that she could make her own when she needed more. She drank the tea every day for some time and gradually her tumors diminished in si ze, then disappeared. Her breast was left scarred, but more than 20 years later, she was still free of cancer. She was nearly 80 when she told Rene her story. \"I was much interested,\" Rene said year s later, \"and wrote down the names of the herbs she had used. I knew that doctors threw up their hands when cancer was discovered in a patient; it was the same as a death sentence, just about. I decided that if I should ever develop cancer, I would use this herb tea. \"About a year later I was visiting an ag ed, retired doctor whom I knew well. We were walking slowly about his garden wh en he took his cane and lifted a weed. `Nurse Caisse,' he told me, `if people woul d use this weed there would be little or no cancer in the world.' \"He told me the name of the plant. It wa s one of the herbs my patient had named as an ingredient of the medicine man's tea.\" Rene always made it clear that she didn't immediately do anything with the inform ation. She had no way of knowing whether to believe it, and she was busy with her nursi ng, so she just filed it away in case she might ever need it in the future. The future came suddenly. A few months afte r she strolled in the garden with the doctor, Rene got word that her mother 's only sister had been operated on in"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 10 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 Brockville, Ontario. She had cancer of the stomach with a liver involvement. She was given six months to live—at most. Rene: \"I hastened to her and talked to her doctor. He was Dr. R.O. Fisher of Toronto, whom I knew well for I'd nursed pa tients for him many times. I told him about the herb tea and asked his permis sion to try it under his observation, since there apparently was nothing more medi cal science could do for my aunt. He consented quickly.\" Thinking she had nothing to lose, Rene ga thered the herbs a nd brewed the tea. According to Rene's account, her aunt dr ank the tea for two months, gradually got stronger and eventually recovered. (And liv ed for another 21 years.) Rene had her first convert in the medical community: Dr. R. O. Fisher. \"Dr. Fisher was so impressed that he asked me to use my treatment on some of his other hopeless cancer cases,\" Rene said years later. Over the next decade, it became common knowledge that Rene and Dr. Fisher were, in fact, treating patients. Those patient s showed enough improvement to convince Dr. Fisher that Rene Caisse was on to an important discovery. He became one of her strongest advocates, and, according to Rene , the person who suggested to her that they could achieve even more dramatic re sults if she would inject the substance hypodermically. Rene later recalled her firs t injection of a human patie nt. A man from Lyons, New York, a patient of Dr. Fisher's, had cancer of the throat and tongue. \"Dr. Fisher wanted me to inject Essiac into the tongue . Well, I was nearly scared to death. And there was a violent reaction. The patient de veloped a severe chill; his tongue swelled so badly the doctor had to pr ess it down with a spatula to let him breathe. That lasted about 20 minutes. Then the swelling went down, the chill subsided, and the patient was all right. The cancer stopped growing, th e patient went home, and he lived quite comfortably for almost four years.\" But it was obvious to Rene that she needed to learn a lot more about the herbs before she injected any more patients. At the same time, she still had to earn a living, so she kept her nursing job and put in long days at the hospital. Her nights and weekends she spent in her mother's basement in Toronto, which she had converted into a laboratory, injecting different combinations of the herbs into mice that had been inoculated with human cancers. Rene conc luded that one of the herbs reduced the growth of the tumors; the other herbs worked as blood purifiers, cleansing the system of destroyed tissue and infections sloughed off by the malignancies. \"I found that the ingredients which stopped the malignancy growth could be given by intramuscular injection in the forearm to destroy the mass of malignant cells, and giving the medicine orally to purify the blood, I got quicker results than when the medicine was all given orally.\" Meanwhile, word was spreading that this nurse was having success in treating cancer patients with her herbal formula. Some of Dr. Fisher's colleagues began asking Rene to treat their hopeless cases. One of those patients was an 80-year-old man whose face was so ravaged by cancer that his doctors said he couldn't live more than ten days. Rene: \"`We will not expect a miracle,' they told me. `But if your treatment can help this man in this stage of cancer, we w ill know that you have discovered something the whole world needs desperately: My tr eatment stopped the bleeding in less than"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR.

He lived for six months, with very little discomfort.\" In 1926, nine licensed Canadian physicians, who had seen the results of Rene's work, took the unusual and dramatic step of petitioning Canada s Department of Health and Welfare to allow Rene to conduc t large-scale tests of Essiac. The petition read: We, the undersigned, believe that the `Tre atment for Cancer' given by Nurse R.M. Caisse can do no harm and that it relieves pain, will reduce the enlargement and will prolong life in hopeless cases. To the best of our knowledge, she has not been given a case to treat until everything in Medical and Surgical Science had been tried without effect, and even then, she was able to show remarkably beneficial results, on these cases, at that late stage. We would be interested to see her given an opportunity to prove her work in a large way. To the best of our knowledge she has treat ed all cases free of any charge and has been carrying on this work over the period of the past two years. Signed, R.O. Fisher, R.C.P,M.R.C.S. J.X.

Rene Caisse was naive enough to believe that her work would now be recognized and advanced through official channels. In her own description, she was \"joyful beyond words at this expression of c onfidence by such outstanding doctors regarding the benefits derived from my treatment.\" But her joy was short-lived. The petition backfired. It became the opening gun in the war over Essiac. The government wasted no time pouncing on this nurse who was practicing medicine. The Department of H ealth and Welfare immediately dispatched two of their doctors to investigate Rene. Carrying official papers that authorized them to have her arrested—or restrained from practicing without a license—they showed up without warning at her front door. Rene was badly shaken, but she explained to them that she was only treating patients who had been given up—abandoned by their physicians as terminally ill, and she was accepting only voluntary contributions. She made no charge for her services. She showed them her papers, her reports, her letters from physicians. They listened to what she had to say and decided to back off. They told her they were not going to have her arrested, nor were they going to order her to stop doing what she'd been doing. Rene won that battle, but the war was on.

As the word of her cancer treatment spread—in largest part by former patients and their friends and families, as well as hundreds of newspaper articles all over Canada—Rene treated dozens, and later hundreds, of patients a month while the doctors and officials who wanted her arrest ed fought—in parliament, in the press, in the government bureaucracy—with the doctors and officials who believed in her and wanted her left alone to do her work. One of the two doctors first sent by the Department of Health and Welfare in 1926 to investigate and perhaps arrest Rene was Dr. W.C. Arnold. He was so impressed with what he saw that he made arrange ments for her to carry on her experiments with mice at the Christie Street Hospital in Toronto, under the supervision of two of the hospital's physicians. (Dr. Arnold, w ho later became chief physician of the Canadian Pension Board, corresponded with Rene for the next 15 years, writing her long letters of encouragement, giving her advice in her po litical battles, helping her round up support and—always—trying to pers uade her to release the formula to him. ) Looking back many years later on her days in the Christie Street Hospital laboratory, Rene said: \"Those mice were inoculated w ith Rous Sarcoma. I kept them alive 52 days—which was longer than anyone else had been able to do.\" Physicians continued to send cancer patients to Rene. One of the doctors who signed the petition in 1926 went even further in 1929. He put into writing at great length and in painful detail exactly what happe ned with one of the cancer patients he referred to Rene Caisse. The two—page, single-spaced letter, da ted March 22, 1929, and signed by Dr. J.A. McInnis, tells the story of a 55-year-old wo man identified only as Mrs. DeCarle. She first visited him, he wrote, in late 1928. She was suffering severe abdominal pains. He examined her and found a tumor in her upper abdomen. \"This tumor was hard and nodular to the touch. There was also another mass which could be distinctly palpated in the region of the uterus.\" Dr. McInnis then wrote: \"From the hist ory of her case, symptoms and physical examination, I had no hesitation in arriving at a diagnosis of carcinoma.\" Later he was informed by Mrs. DeCarle's family th at she had been under the care of two specialists in Brockville who believed that the condition was malignant and that Mrs. DeCarle had only several months to live. \"As this case was inoperable,\" Dr. McInni s stated, \"any treatment given her could only be of a palliative nature and we began to administer Miss Caisse s treatment for cancer on December 3 rd . The medicine was in liquid form and given orally, twice daily. After the first ten days treatment, quite an improvement was observed, both in the patient's condition generally and in connection with the two tumors I have described, in regard to size and cons istency. The abdomen was less rigid, her appetite was improved and the discomfort and pain after eating was considerably lessened.\" In his examinations of Mrs. DeCarle ove r the next several weeks, Dr. McInnis stated, he found that the tumors in he r abdomen and her pelvis were becoming smaller, and the nodular condition of the growths was disappearing. \"In addition, the general health and condition of the patie nt improved wonderfully. Each week she felt better and was able to remain up for th e greater part of the day, could eat well, pain and discomfort had disappeared a nd she began occupying herself with house"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR.

GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 13 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 work, besides which, she was gaining in weight.\" Mrs. DeCarle was treated until March 1 st , \"when her general condition of heal th appeared normal. The growth in the upper abdomen reduced, at least, by more than two thirds of its former size, the nodular condition entirely disappeared, and wh at remained would appear to be only adhesions from rolled up omentum. The tumo r in the pelvis was scarcely palpable at all.\" Dr. McInnis then described Mrs. DeCarl e as looking \"in normal health.\" She had told him she was feeling as well as sh e ever did, and she had gained 20 pounds. \"Altogether, I would say that the tr eatment has brought about a remarkable transformation. Whether the results so far obtained from Miss Caisse's treatment will be permanent, remains to be seen. I am of the opinion that these results are conclusive.\" Dr. McInnis noted that no X-ray had been taken before the treatment was begun, and no X-ray had been taken since the end of th e treatment. But: \"At the time the gastric series were made, films indicated the presence of the two masses I have described and were strongly indicative of carcinoma.\" He concluded: \"I desire to state that the results of Miss Caisse's treatment have been decidedly remarkable and I have no hes itation in making the statement that this treatment has reduced the growths to a mi nimum, has entirely relieved pain and has apparently restored the patient to normal health.\" Even physicians whose skepticism initia lly bordered on hostility were being won over by what they saw A typical example is Dr. J. Masson Smith of Beaverton, Ontario. On February 23, 1932, he addresse d a curt \"Dear Madam\" letter to Rene informing her, in the briefest possible te rms, that Mr. E Maxwell appeared to have \"malignant disease in his Pancreas.\" Dr. Smith listed the symptoms—loss of appetite, loss of 20 pounds, extreme weakness—and said that Mr. Maxwell \"w ishes to undertake your treatment.\" The doctor reluctantly offered no objections. Five weeks later, on March 30, 1932, Dr. S mith wrote a second letter to Rene. This time he couldn't have been friendlier—and it was obvious how impressed he was. \"Mr. E Maxwell came to my office Sunday last,\" Dr. Smith wrote. \"Frankly, I was delighted to see such a marked improvement in his general health. \"He has gained seven and a half pounds. His hemoglobin estimated ninety percent. He moves with a great deal more vigor and mentally he is very much brighter and alert. \"I would be interested to know somethi ng more definite of your treatment. With what particular conditions do you use it and what do you claim for it? Over what period of time do you believe it should be used? I will watch Mr. Maxwell's progress with a great deal of interest.\" (Mr. Maxwell's progress, as it turned out, was very good. In Rene Caisse's files is a letter from him, dated five y ears later, in which he says his brother is now sick and asks if Rene would please treat him. \"H e knows just as much and more than I do what you did for me,\" Mr. Maxwell wrote in 1937.) With results like that, Rene s life was going through a complete upheaval. As many"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 14 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 as 30 patients a day were showing up at her apartment for treatment. She decided she had to give up her nursing job to be able to devote full-time to her patients, and since she wasn't allowed to charge for her services, she was now dependent upon whatever voluntary contributions came her way. The neighbors in her apartment building in Toronto objected to the constant stream of people into and out of Rene's apartment at all hours, so she was forced to move to Peterborough, east of Toronto. But she used to joke with friends that she would have had to move sooner or later anyway, beca use once she quit nursing to treat patients she couldn't afford the rent in Toronto. Shortly after she moved to Peterborough, a health officer showed up at her door one morning at 8 a.m., saying that he had a wa rrant to arrest her for malpractice. As upset as she was, Rene calmly sat the official down, told him her whole story, showed him what she was doing and won him over. Instead of arresting her, he returned to his boss, Dr. R.J. Noble, registrar of the Canadian College of Physicians and Surge ons, to explain the situation to him. Once again, Rene had talked her way out of the threat of a jail cell. But she was frantic. This was already the second time she'd come within an unsympathetic ear of being arrested. So she organized her own counterattack. She took five friendly doctors and 12 of her pa tients to the office of the Minister of Health, Dr. Robb. Dr. Robb heard them out and promised Rene that she wouldn't be arrested—for the time being—if she continued to accept only patients who had a written diagnosis of cancer from their doctors—and if she made no charge. That was fine with Rene. \"The look of gratitude I saw in my pa tients' eyes when relief from pain was accomplished,\" she wrote years later, \"a nd the hope and cheerfulness that returned when they saw their malignancies reducing was pay enough for all my efforts.\" In 1932, the Toronto Star published the fi rst major newspaper article about Rene Caisse and Essiac. The headline read: \"Bracebridge Girl Makes Notable Discovery Against Cancer.\" The story was now out in front of th e public. Rene was 44 years old, badly overweight, under heavy stress carrying her pa tient load, and on her feet all day and half the night in the kitchen of her apartment cooking up Essiac. Now she was going to be facing the additi onal pressures of becoming a sought after public figure and the center of a major politi cal battle in the Canadian parliament. The battle would build in Canada for th e rest of the 1930s, and what Rene went through would have destroyed someone with less determination and stamina. But it didn't destroy Rene. In fact, she fo rced a national government to question the most cherished assumptions of its own legal and medical bureaucracies. She came very close to winning official acceptance and recognition for her treatment of cancer patients with Essiac."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 15 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 CHAPTER TWO Almost immediately after the Toronto St ar newspaper article, Rene was deluged with people who needed her help or want ed to do business with her. A Toronto businessman named Ernest H. Ashley had a contract drawn up that offered Rene her own clinic, $20,000 within the first year of signing, an annual salary of $2,000, and $100,000 in operating capital and stock in th e corporation to be formed—if she would \"assign and set over all her right, title and interest in the said formula above referred to.\" For a woman who used to laugh that she never had $100 she could call her own, the offer must have been tempting, at least for a moment. Those were big dollar figures in 1932. But Rene turned him down, stuck the unsigned contract in her files and left it there to gather dust. As Rene treated an increasing number of patients, the word about her work continued to be positive, even in some official circles. On June 17, 1933, she received a letter on official stationery from the Deputy Minister of Hospitals for Ontario. He wrote: \"Through a friend of mine here I have learned of your wonderful treatment for cancer, and I s hould greatly appreciate a letter setting forth briefly the nature of your treatment. Please state how long you have been using this treatment, approximately how many cases you have treat ed and with what results, and whether you have any testimonials or press c lippings endorsing your work. If you have copies of the latter I should be glad to re ceive them and will return same as soon as possible. This letter is purely personal, and not official, so please feel free to write me fully.\" About that same time, one of the most prominent doctors in the Bracebridge area, Dr. A. F Bastedo, agreed to let Rene trea t one of his patients who was considered to be terminally ill with bowel cancer. Wh en the patient recovered, Dr. Bastedo persuaded the Town Council of Bracebridge to turn over to Rene for $1.00 a month rent—the British Lion Hotel for her use as a \"cancer clinic,\" if she would come back to her home town to practice. The British Lion Hotel, on one of the main streets in town, within walking distance of the Municipal Building and directly ac ross the street from the jail, had been repossessed by the village for back taxes. In 1935, Rene opened the doors. Rene: \"The Mayor and Council were very en thusiastic and with their aid and the aid of friends, relatives and patients, I furnis hed an office, dispensary, reception room and five treatment rooms. Here I worked for almost eight years with a large `CANCER CLINIC' sign on the door. Doctors sent or brought their patients to me. Doctors from many parts of the United States came to watch me treat, to examine patients and observe results. Patients came from far in ambulances, but after having a few treatments, were able to walk into the clinic by themselves. They came from far and near. Here, for almost eight years, I treated thousands of patients.\" Rene's account is true. The older people in the Bracebridge area still have vivid memories of Nurse Caisse and her clinic , and all the patients coming from far and near. They still talk about friends or ne ighbors or aunts or uncles or parents who were saved or at least helped and relieve d of pain by Nurse Caisse. They speak of her with great fondness and respect—even reverence, in many cases."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 16 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 One local woman now in her 60s rememb ers when she was 12 years old watching Nurse Caisse in her white uniform chasi ng the woman's parents down the street. Her father had stomach cancer, and he'd left too much money behind after his treatment. Nurse Caisse's green eyes were flashing. She said, \"Don't you ever dare do that to me again.\" She made him take his money back. To this day the woman still remembers he r mother and father joyfully dancing together because the treatments by Nurs e Caisse had taken his pain away. Based on contemporary newspaper account s and their own interviews with eyewitnesses, Homemaker's, a Canadian national magazine, later described the scene in the 1930s: \"Dominion Street took on an atmosphere reminiscent of the famous Shrine of Lourdes, as hopeful pilg rims sought a new lease on life. Cars were parked solidly along its shoulders. People from all walks of life waited patiently to enter the red brick building. Some were ca rried. Others were pushed gently up the steps, while the rest managed on their own. Occasionally, an ambulance would shriek its arrival as it double-parked. Rene would be seen coming quickly down to it to treat a stretcher case. Always with a doctor standing by, she injected scores of patients every day.\" About the time Rene opened the clinic, he r 72-year-old mother was diagnosed with inoperable cancer of the liver. Four local doctors said she was too weak for surgery. But Rene called in one of Ontario's t op specialists, Dr. Roscoe Graham. He confirmed the diagnosis and, in Rene's account, said: \"Her liver is a nodular mass.\" One of the local doctors who didn't approve of Rene's work said to her, sarcastically: \"Why don't you do something?\" Rene replied: \"I'm certainly going to try, Doctor.\" She asked Dr. Graham, \"How long does she have to live?\" Dr. Graham said he thought it was only a matter of days. According to Rene, she didn't even tell her mother she had cancer. Instead, Rene gave her daily injections of Essi ac, saying it was a tonic prescribed by her doctor. Many years later Rene reminisced: \"To make a long story short, my mother completely recovered. She passed away quietly after her 90 th birthday—without pain, just a tired heart. This repaid me for all of my work—giving my mother 18 years of life she would not have had without Essiac. It made up for a great deal of the persecution I have endured at the hands of the medical people.\" With a nurse now openly treating large num bers of cancer patients, in her own \"cancer clinic,\" subsidized partly by th e town of Bracebridge, the political battle started to heat up. On September 14, 1935, th e Ontario Minister of Health, Dr. J.A. Faulkner, wrote to Rene saying that if sh e expected the government to take measures to see that her remedy be put into use for all cancer patients in the Province of Ontario, she would have to turn over her formula. \"It is necessary that a full statement be submitted,\" he wrote, \"indicating the exact nature of the materials suggested for use, the manner in which they are to be used including dosage and the experience which has attended their use, with such detailed reports on pathological dia gnosis, treatment and presen t condition of patients as exist.\""},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 17 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 Eleven days later, Faulkner wrote to Rene again. He said that he had \"chosen an outstanding scientist to investigate your treatment. If you will submit the information desired it will be referred to him for investigation and report.\" Rene wasn't about to turn over the formul a. She was wide open about her work; she welcomed physicians who wanted to visit her clinic and investigate for themselves what she was doing. She wanted doctors to examine her patients, talk to them, and look at the records. But until the medica l profession gave official acknowledgment that Essiac had merit, Rene was determin ed that the formula itself would remain secret. Meanwhile, public pressure was building in support of Rene. In a remarkable display of grassroots political action, the local residents of the Bracebridge area rounded up thousands of signatures on petit ions demanding government backing for her work. The petitions were presented to Dr. Faulkne r. He also received another petition with only nine signatures—but they were a ll physicians, including seven who hadn't signed the original petition back in 1926. Th is brought to 16 the number of licensed physicians who had staked their reputations on an endorsement of Rene and Essiac. By 1936, the Canadian press was paying close attention to the story. Articles—and letters to the editor—began to appear with some regularity throughout Ontario. There were many accounts written by peopl e who said they had received Nurse Caisse s treatments and had been cured of cancer. This was really the beginning of the notion that Rene Caisse wa s preaching that she could cure all cancer. She wasn't. She wa s saying that Essiac caused regression in tumors, prolonged life, relieved pain and—i n the right circumstances with patients whose organs weren't already destroye d—could cure cancer. But the heartfelt tributes from grateful patients tended to simplify the message. As far as they were concerned, she cured cancer and that was all there was to it. Typical of the letters to the editor wa s one signed by Herbert Rawson and published in the spring of 1936. Rawson said that he was a middle aged ma n who had been getting sicker and sicker and seeing various doctors, to no avail. Fi nally an X-ray showed cancer. The doctors advised an operation. \"I had seen so many ot hers that have had operations that I just refused,\" Mr. Rawson wrote. \"They sent me to Miss Caisse. That was a year ago on the 20 th of April. About three weeks ago two of the best doctors examined me well and to my great joy, they told me I was a free man from that dreaded disease, cancer. These were their words: `You will never know what you owe that girl: So I can say that I feel in the best of health and have gained weight. No doubt Miss Caisse will be surprised to see this letter. I would sin cerely ask everyone who can to help her in this great work.\" Rene's results continued to impress othe rs. One of her patients shortly after she opened her clinic was a man named John Tynan. A few years later, Tynan would testify under oath before a Canadian par liamentary commission investigating Essiac that he had been diagnosed by four differ ent doctors as having cancer of the rectum and been given, in their estimate, about thr ee weeks to live. \"I went to the operating room again,\" Tynan testified, \"and they di dn't do anything because they couldn't, and they put me to bed and they said, you may have a few days in bed and then you may"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 18 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 as well go home.\" Tynan testified that when he left the hosp ital he went to Rene's clinic and took the first of 27 regular treatments. Within 24 hour s, he began to feel relief. Within four days, he felt \"a wonderful change,\" and after the first few treatments he was able to drive himself to the clinic. Four years after the treatments, he had gained 39 pounds and felt in good health. One of the people who was familiar with the Tynan case was Dr. W. C. Arnold, the physician who had first been sent by the Mini ster of Health to arrest Rene. What he saw must have made a deep impression on him because buried in Rene's files is a long, handwritten letter to her from Dr . Arnold, dated February 5, 1936. In it, he discusses the pressures upon her to release the formula, urges her to let him begin testing Essiac, and then he says: \"If I ca n get one case to respond as John Tynan did, I'll throw in with you 100% and drop everything else.\" By now, the local politicians were gett ing involved. The mayor of Bracebridge, Wilburt Richards, visited the office of Dr. Faulkner, the Minister of Health, with a group of prominent citizens and a petiti on with 2,700 signatures asking that the government accept and officially authorize Rene's treatment of patients. Whatever Dr. Faulkner actually promised them, his actions following the meeting were not enough to satisfy Rene. On Ma y 3, 1936, she wrote to Dr. Faulkner: \"You promised the deputation who waited on you and made presentation of a petition signed by 2,700 people on my behalf that you would allow me to demonstrate my treatment before doctors, of your choosi ng, on patients, of their choosing. This you have failed to do. You simply wrote and asked me to send the formula. \"I should think the public Health Departme nt would be back of anyone who would try to help suffering humanity. Instead of this, I find you putting every obstacle in my way.\" Rene offered this challenge to the Minist er of Health: Let her send some of her patients—and their case histories, X-ra y plates, and so on—for examination by doctors. \"And then if you are not satisfied, I will give up this work. I could not be more reasonable than that, could I?\" The political pressure on Rene's behalf a ppeared to be paying off. On July 10, 1936, a headline in the Toronto Evening Telegr am stated: \"Assure Bracebridge Nurse Aid in her Cancer `Cure'. Miss Rene Ca isse, With Big Delegation and One-Time Patients, Sees Faulkner.\" The story reporte d that Dr. Faulkner had agreed to give Rene Caisse his cooperation in determining th e merits of Essiac. \"If Miss Caisse has confidence in her cure,\" the story quoted Fa ulkner as saying, \"she will have a chance to prove it. If it is proved, the govern ment will certai nly get behind it.\" Dr. Faulkner told the press that he would arrange for Rene to discuss her treatment with Sir Frederick Banting. That was per ceived to be a major breakthrough for Rene. Sir Frederick Banting was one of the medical heavyweights of the 1930s, publicly credited as the co-discoverer of insulin, and with his own research facility, The Banting Institute, at the University of Toronto. Faulkner's announcement of Banting's entry into the Essiac controve rsy made headlines in newspapers all through Canada. Later in July, 1936, Rene—accompanied by five doctors who supported her"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 19 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 work—had her meeting with Dr. Banting. He offered her the facilities of his laboratory and invited her to work ther e under his supervision performing tests on animals. \"You will not be asked to divulge any secret concerning your treatment,\" Dr. Banting wrote to Rene on July 23. \"All expe rimental results must be submitted to me for my approval before being announced to anyone, including the newspapers, or published in medical journals.\" But there was a catch in Dr. Banting's offe r. He wanted Rene to prove the merit of Essiac on the lab animals be fore she treated any more humans. She would have to give up her work at the clinic for months , or even years, while she injected mice again. Rene regretfully turned down Sir Fred erick Banting. On August 4, 1936, she wrote to Dr. Faulkner explaining her decision: \"I have just wr itten to Dr. Banting to tell him that it is impossible for me to accept his kind offer. My relatives and friends do not approve of my going back to animal research, when I have already proven the merit of my Cancer Treatment on human beings. \"Therefore they absolutely refuse to help me financially, and since I have not been able to charge my patients for treatment, I have been at my wits ends to meet the expense of the materials I use. I have never had a hundred dollars I could call my own, therefore it is utterly impossible to do what I haven't the means to do, isn't it? I will just have to go on as I have been doing, and next year I will bring more proof and more names on a petition and we'll make it a political issue. \"I appreciate the fact that you are doing what you think is best for me, and to please you I wish I were in a positi on to accept this offer, but there is a saying, that you can't get blood out of a stone, and that is my position at the present time.\" Dr. Banting wouldn't budge from his position, that Rene could only work on animals in his lab—and nothing else. On the same day she wrote Dr. Faulkner, Dr. Banting wrote the mayor of Bracebridge: \"In my opinion it would be impossible for you to adequately test Miss Caisse's cancer treatment in Bracebridge. As I explained to Miss Caisse, I would personally not take any responsibility for work done outside of the laboratory. The whole matter was previ ously discussed with the Honorable Dr. Faulkner, and we are still prepared to test Miss Caisse's treatment under the arrangements set forth in my letter to her.\" Rene wouldn't budge from her position, desp ite the advice from some of her old allies in the medical world that she might be well advised to consider the offer. Dr. W C. Arnold wrote to Rene: \"I have just read your letter from Banting, and I think it is fair enough. It is the same proposition I made to you many years ago when we put the mice into the Christie Street lab.\" While Dr. Arnold agreed that he understood Rene's objections and had some of his own, he wrote that the offer \"was, perhaps, as much as you could have expected.\" Dr. Banting tried to talk Rene out of her decision, but failed. On August 11, 1936, he wrote her one last time. Implic it in his letter is the belief that her lab tests might well have led to favorable results and his valuable endorsement: \"I think you will regret that you have not availed yourself of the offer made by this la boratory. However, if at some future time you again decide to ha ve the treatment investigated, I am sure"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 20 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 that Doctor Faulkner and myself would reconsider the matter.\" What Dr. Banting really believed about Essiac is nowhere on the record. Rene always maintained that he had told her th at what he had seen of Essiac showed more promise than any other cancer treatment he had ever encountered. She said until the end of her life that Dr. Banting had been particularly impressed by one of her cases in which the patient had cancer and diab etes. Since no one knew how Essiac would mix with insulin, the patient's doctor—Dr. J.A. McInnis—had taken the patient off of insulin while the Essiac was administer ed. The diabetes didn't worsen. According to Rene, Dr. Banting had been familiar with this case since 1926. He had examined the records and X-rays taken during the Essiac treatments and told Rene that Essiac must have somehow stimulated the pancr eatic gland into functioning properly. But only Rene's account of these conversations with Dr. Banting is available today. More than 40 years after her rejection of Dr. Banting's offer, Rene reminisced to reporters from a Canadian magazine: \"He was very kind, but he made it clear I'd have to give up my clinic if I went to work with him. I felt it was inhuman for them to ask me to give up treating patients while I showed them whether it would work on mice. I'd already done work on mice. \"There was a big uproar about it because th e patients were terrified I would leave them, but many doctors said I should jump at the chance to work with Dr. Banting. I said I'd be willing to, but I'm not going to let people di e while I do it. It was an agonizing decision, but I refused his offer.\" Two weeks after Rene turned down Dr. Banting's offer, two New York City cancer specialists arrived in Bracebridge to invest igate Rene's work. They liked what they saw, and almost immediately Canadian ne wspapers carried stories saying that Rene might take her treatment across the border. On August 27, 1936, the Montreal Monitor reported that Rene, \"who has become nationally known through her research and inte rest in the cause of cancer cure and prevention will shortly receive a very attr active offer from American physicians with regard to a position in the United States.\" On the same day, the Huntsville Forester, de crying this threat from the Americans to steal Rene Caisse away from Canada, edito rialized: \"If the work of Miss Caisse is the cure of cancer, as is claimed for it, not only should it be welcomed greedily by the medical profession, but it should interest most actively the heads of our health departments of government. \"Evidence of the effectiveness of the tr eatment given by Miss Caisse seems to be conclusive. Several known cases in Muskoka have been cited where cancer was the professional diagnosis, and where apparent cures have been effected. The patients themselves are the best evidence Miss Caisse can present. \"But instead of a serious attempt being made to capitalize on the discovery of Miss Caisse, the official and professional appro ach to this matter has been discouragingly technical, skeptical and indifferent. Now, th ere is a possibility that Bracebridge and Canada may lose Miss Caisse to the more discerning and less rigid medical profession of the United States.\" There were other offers from the U.S., and after sorting through her options, Rene finally announced to the press in Octobe r, 1936 that she was going to a Chicago"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 21 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 university to demonstrate her cancer treatment on some of their patients. On October 19, the headline in the Toront o Globe read: \"Cancer Remedy Claimed in Bracebridge Goes to U.S.A.\" The story re ported that Rene was going to be working with a former diagnostician from the Ma yo Clinic. The arrangements had been made by a University of Toronto anatomy profes sor, Dr. B. L. Guyatt, who later became an important supporter in Rene s political fights. Dr. Guyatt was one of those who visited Rene's clinic to do his own investigation. He wrote in his report: \"In most cases distorted countenances became normal and pain reduced as treatment proceeded. The re lief from pain is a notable feature, as pain in these cases is very difficult to control. \"The number of patients treated in this clinic are many hundreds and the number responding wholly or in part I do not know , but I do know that I have witnessed in this clinic a treatment which brings re storation through destroying the tumor tissue, and supplying that something which improves the mental outlook on life.\" At the news that Rene was going to the United States, there was a flood of angry mail to Premier Hepburn and the Minister of Health. The Mayor of Bracebridge wrote to Dr. Faulkner in blunt terms: \"The people in this part of the Province who have known of this work are up in arms about the way in which Miss Caisse has been treated.\" There were angry editorials in newspa pers all through Ontario. And Rene was skillful in her dealings with the press. She was always good for a juicy quote, a quick few lines that would inspire the gr owing public indignation with the way she was being treated by the Canadian government. One paper quoted her as saying: \"I have been begging the Ontario authorities for thirteen years to give me a chance. I wa nted to keep this discovery Canadian, but there seems no chance of bri nging out anything of benefit here. I am simply forced to go over to the other side to get recognition.\" But she promised that she would never ab andon Canada and her patients. She would go to the States only every other week, wh ile maintaining her work at home the rest of the time. \"I can assure you that th ere will always be a cancer clinic in Bracebridge,\" she told the reporter. For the next several months, Rene somehow managed the stress of working on both sides of the border. Under the supervision of Dr. John Wolfer, the director of the Tumor Clinic of the Northwestern Un iversity Medical School, Rene commuted almost weekly between Ch icago and Bracebridge. While keeping her clinic open, she was treating 30 terminally ill patient s in Chicago. Five Northwestern doctors were working with her on the project. In later years she told friends and reporters that the workload during that period was a nightmare. She treated her Bracebridge patients on the weekends, stopped in Toronto to treat a few patients there, then went to Chicago and back to Bracebridge to start all over. She was staying up most of the night in Bracebridge cooking and preparing new batches of Essiac. At one point she had to beg off her duties in Chicago. She'd made herself sick trying to satisfy everyone's needs. On Februa ry 26, 1937, she wrote to Dr. Wolfer: \"I am"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L.

I treated two hundred patients he re at my Clinic a week ago, went on to Toronto and treated fourteen more, then on to Walkerville to treat again more. \"When I took ill, my brother-in-law from Fe rndale, Michigan came after me in a car and took me to my sister who had her fam ily doctor see me. He said it was my heart and over-nervous strain and that I need two or three months absolute rest. \"But tomorrow I must start on my patients here again. I wanted to please you, but it was unfair of you to have me spend a bout a hundred dollars besides risking my health to go there and treat six patients, for you, as I did last time I was there. Tell me candidly if you have lost interest.\" He hadn't. He wrote Rene back on Ma rch 13, 1937, saying he was slow to respond because he'd been out of the country, a nd he was still \"in hopes that we might be able to carry along our work at the Clinic for a sufficient time to provide us with some evidence to enable us to make up our minds relative to your treatment.\" Before long, Rene was feeling well enough to return to Chicago and carry on as before. On March 25, she wrote Dr. Wolfer to say she would be back on April 4. He wrote her back immediately saying he was glad to hear the news and would make the arrangements. Rene's return was brief. She soon got si ck again and decided she'd better stay in Bracebridge. But one of the doctors in Chicago, Dr. Clifford Barbouka, had seen enough to be a believer. He offered her fa cilities at Chicago's Passavant Hospital if she wanted to move there. But she chose to stay at home in Bracebridge. When the news that she was t oo ill to travel reached her patients in Chicago, at least one of them was alarmed enough to writ e directly to Rene. On May 14, 1937, May Miller of Chicago wrote to say she hope d Rene was recovering from her latest illness and to say she hoped shed be seeing Rene again. \"The first time I came to the Northwestern University Tumor Clinic to receive your arm injections,\" Ms. Miller wrote, \"I had been for several weeks previous, suffering such acute agony in my shoulder, back of my neck, and up in the back of my head, that my doctor had given me a narcotic to enable me to rest some at night. \"So when, shortly before the fifth injection, I realized that the terrible head pain at the back had subsided and that though I still had pain, it was in such a lesser degree (I have to take anidon (sic) pain tablets fo r it) and I was starting to get some sleep at night, I was mighty thankful to God because of your coming to this Clinic here. \"Miss Case (sic); since I wa s starting to feel much bette r of my pain, wouldn't I have felt practically none pain by now, if it had not been that you were stricken with your two severe illnesses and so could not give us the benefit of your injections? \"About three weeks ago my neck swelling suddenly began to pain considerably. It makes me hope we'll be seeing you soon again, for I am sure I was being helped.\" By now, the Canadian press was making a political issue out of Rene Caisse and Essiac. At the beginning of 1937, with Re ne's work on both sides of the border getting attention, the Toronto Evening Telegram set the tone for the coming debate with an editorial comparing the governme nt's treatment of Rene with the hostility Louis Pasteur had faced in an earlier century. \"It is to be questioned whether today"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR.

GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 23 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 the medical profession has brought a suffi ciently open mind to it's fight against cancer.\" Saying that Rene was \"reported to have a ttained astonishing results,\" the Telegram knocked the medical authorities for their at titude of \"Put your formula on the table and we will tell you whether we will help you.\" Dr. Banting, the paper said, \"did not place in sulin on the table until he was satisfied with the results of his research....If it is a fact that a clinic has been provided in Chicago and refused in Ontario, it is necessa ry that there should be an explanation of the reason for the refusal here. Results ar e more important than medical etiquette.\" Angry letters from citizens began to pour into the offices of the Minister of Health and the Prime Minister of Ontario, M itchell Hepburn. Typical of the mail Hepburn was receiving was the letter he received from a nurse in Peterboro, Ontario, who was caring for one of Rene's patients and had seen the benefits of Essiac. The patient, Mrs. Oliver, had been ope rated on in November, 1936. The surgeon had found a cancerous growth on her colon, whic h he couldn't remove. \"Nothing could be done for her, just a matter of time, possibly six months,\" the nurse wrote. \"Meaning another life gone. When she came home from the hospital hardly able to walk across the floor and suffering from such severe pain that she could neither sleep nor rest was when I came to care for her.\" Mrs. Oliver's husband had heard of Nurse Caisse and as the only chance, they took Mrs. Oliver to Bracebridge. \"She has now had 4 treatments & improving all the time. Everyone marvels at the change in her. Now Hon. Premier Hepburn, does it seem fair to you to make it so that Mi ss Caisse may no longer give treatments when hundreds of outcast patients from the foremost hospitals and noted doctors are at the present depending on her treatments for lif e? Does it seem fair to you that the formula should be taken from Miss Caisse to experiment on guinea pigs when it has been tried and proven successful on hundred s of human beings? Who is foremost in this Prov. of Ont., human beings or guin ea pigs? When Drs. admit that they are unable to cure or do anything for patient s why take from someone that which is proving successful?\" Passions were running high. The government was being forced into a position where it had to do something. They had to put Rene out of business, arrest her, get her formula, or finally authorize her to practice medicine. On March 8, 1937, the Toronto Evening Te legram reported: \"Matters soon will reach a final stage in the efforts of Mi ss Rene Caisse, Bracebridge nurse, to obtain Canadian medical recognition for her cancer treatment methods.\" The story said that next week a large deputation from various locations in Ontario would be calling on Premier Hepburn and Dr. Faulkner and othe r cabinet members. They would urge that she be given the right to practice medicine, and they would be carrying a new petition—this one with 14,000 signatures. The deputation, the paper reported, would in clude several doctors, notably Dr. B.L. Guyatt of the University of Toronto, Dr. W C. Arnold, Dr. Herbert Minthorn—the associate coroner of two Ontario districts—and Dr. J.A. McInnis. A few nights before the group left for Tor onto, the mayor of Bracebridge organized a town meeting to rally support. The high school gymnasium was packed. The"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 24 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 mayor told the crowd that the vast sums of money spent on cancer research had produced no recognized cures. He said he didn't know if Rene Caisse had a cure, but he did know that people who were suffering from cancer before they went to Rene were well today. Dr. Edward Ellis told the crowd that he had seen interesting results from Rene's treatments, but that \"science creeps slowl y. We can only think so much and say little as doctors, although as private citizens we are right behind a beneficial treatment.\" Dr. Minthorn stood up and said th at he had seen Rene's wo rk three times four weeks apart. He was skeptical at first. \"But Miss Caisse is doing a good work and has ample proof.\" Rene's long-time supporter, Dr. J.A. McInni s, told of his acquaintance with Rene, dating back to when only a few people knew what she was doing. \"Personally,\" he told the crowd, \"I am absolutely convinced that Miss Caisse's methods will arrest pain, reduce cancer growth and prolong life, and I say that very guardedly.\" Some of Rene s patients told their own stories. Jack Vanclieaf walked to the platform and said: \"Here I am alive today, while I would have been dead years ago had it not been for Miss Caisse. Two good doctors told me I had only two months to live. I went to Miss Caisse and within th ree days the intense pain was relieved and with more treatments I kept on getting be tter. Hon. Dr. Faulkner told me I hadn't cancer, but all I've to say is, what is th e difference between being eaten by a wolf or eaten by a bear? The doctor said he couldn' t cure me and that I would die. Miss Caisse cured me in six treatments.\" The deputation that went to the government offices in Toronto consisted of local officials, 40 doctors and 18 of Rene s patients. They were carrying a petition that now had 17,000 signatures. Things were m oving fast. There were more front page headlines throughout Ontario when the Minist er of Health, Dr. Faulkner, and Dr. R. T Noble of the College of Physicians and Surgeons met with the group. Later in the day Sir Frederick Banting met with some of them. After the meetings, Dr. Faulkner told th e press: \"We are considering introducing legislation that will give all the people who have the idea they have a cure for cancer an opportunity to submit their cures to test and they will receive such encouragement that will put beyond doubt the nature of the treatment.\" That was the first time a public official ha d mentioned legislation to deal with the situation. Public pressure was great enough that the battle was now working its way toward the Canadian parliament. In July, 1937, with an election coming up in a few months and the letters pouring in from Rene's patients and supporters, Premier Mitchell Hepburn agreed to meet her in his Queens Park office. Rene told the press the Premier had been encouraging. Talking about Rene and her supporters, Premier Hepburn told the press: \"These people are sincere, clear-thinking people, a nd it seems to me that something must be done to make this treatment available to all people suffering from cancer. \"The onus is now on the medical profes sion. They must now either prove or disprove Miss Caisse s claims, and I do not believe they can disprove them. I am in sympathy with Miss Caisse's work, and will do all in my power to help her.\""},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 25 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 He stated publicly that if he had to, he would see that a bill licensing her to practice would be passed in the legislature. Politi cally, that put Hepburn way out in front of cautious politicians and skeptical doctors. No such bill allowing one private citizen without the proper medical credentials to pr actice medicine had ever been passed in the history of Canada. But Hepburn had seen enough mail and heard from enough of Rene's patients to know that the public was solidly behind her. He knew where the votes were. At the same time, a group of American businessmen from Buffalo, New York, had become familiar with Essiac and they drew up a contract and presented it to Rene. For the right to represent Essiac in the U. S., they promised to pay her at least $100,000 in the first year, $50,000 in all succeed ing years, plus 50% \"of all sums received\" from the use of Essiac. In a sepa rate letter to her a fe w weeks later, their lawyer, Ralph Saft, sweetened the offer by promising a $1 million \"donation\" to her work. Rene had meetings with them and ex tensive correspondence. But she gradually became convinced that they were only out to make a fast buck. She was afraid they would exploit the rich and make Essiac prohibitively expensive for the poor. She turned them down and stuck their contract in her files, alongside the one she'd been offered by the businessman from Toronto. By mid-1937, hundreds of people a week desper ate for Rene's help were flocking to her clinic. She was treating as many of th em as possible, still staying up half the night in her kitchen brewing the Essiac, but she was now beginning to face a new problem. An increasing number of patients were arriving without a signed letter from a physician stating a diagnosis of cancer. Some doctors—fearful of offending Canada's powerful College of Physicians and Surgeons—were refusing to put into writing this release Rene was required to have before treating anyone. This new obstacle caused scen es and dramatically added to Rene's stress, as she dealt with how to prod the doctors into ac tion, how to stall the frantic patients, even how to treat people without the necessary documentation and still avoid jail. But the hostility of much of the medical es tablishment didn't prevent the most solid citizens from seeking out Rene. The pr esident of the Toronto Globe and Mail newspaper sent one of his own staffers to be treated by Rene. A lawyer in Des Moines, Iowa, wrote to Rene saying that his college roommate s wife had been cured of br east cancer by Essiac and the la wyer now wanted to make arrangements for Rene to treat another frie nd of his, an Iowa Supreme Court Justice. A woman physician from Los Angeles, Dr. Emma Carson, who had heard accounts of Rene's successes, traveled from southe rn California to Bracebridge in the summer of 1937 to see for herself. She later told reporters that she had been skeptical, even though her friends who had told her about Rene were reliable people. Intending only to stay in Bracebridge for a couple of days to satisfy herself that there was nothing to the story, she ended up staying almost a month and becoming a good friend of Rene's. In Dr. Carson's first interview, with the H untsville Forester a week after her arrival, she could barely contain her enthusiasm. \"I am simply am azed at what I have found in my already brief investigation,\" she sai d. \"The farther I investigate, the stronger"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 26 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 becomes my conviction that Miss Caisse has made a cancer treatment discovery of world-wide importance.\" Dr. Carson said that she had found \"s ome amazing cases.\" She called upon the government to recognize Rene Caisse s work. \"If in view of what I have seen with my own eyes, the Ontario Medical Council remains indifferent, it will be a crime against civilization.\" She said that when she finished her investigation, she would go directly to Prime Minister Hepbur n's office and give him her report. Dr. Carson never changed her mind about Re ne Caisse and Essiac. She kept up her correspondence with Rene for years after she returned to Los Angeles, and when she had concluded her investigation she wrote a five-page report and released it to the press. Several newspapers quoted all or much of what she had to say. \"The vast majority of Miss Caisses patien ts,\" Dr. Carson wrote, \"were brought to her after surgery, radium, X-rays, emplastrums, etc., had failed to be helpful and the patients were pronounced incurable or hope less cases. The progress obtainable and the actual results from Essiac treatments, and the rapidity of repair were absolutely marvelous, and must be seen to be belie ved.\" As she reviewed case histories and interviewed patients, she wrote, \"I realized that skepticism had deserted me.\" In November, Hepburn's Liberal Party w on the elections, and Rene received a friendly note from Hepburn's secretary sayi ng that if Rene would like another meeting with the Prime Minister, please just advise them by telephone. In less than three years, Rene Caisse ha d gone from being an obscure nurse in the northwoods treating those people in the area who'd heard of her by word of mouth to a national figure in Canada, with an open door in the office of the Prime Minister of Ontario. She was the center of a major political controversy. Her thousands of backers were passionate about her cause, especially those who had been her patients. From the beginning, the people who had been treated with Essiac were the ones who spread the word, wrote the press, wrote th e politicians, sent Rene more patients, and pushed the government to legalize her practice. All through Rene's files are testimonials fr om her patients, dating from the 1920s to the 1970s. They are anecdotal and written by laymen with no medical training. But there are so many, from every level of so ciety in the U. S. and Canada, and the people who wrote them were so deeply affected and so passionate in their belief, that after reading through all of them, they become impossible to ignore. Many of these statements are so categorical that if they are even close to portraying accurately what happened, they alone shoul d be enough to prompt serious scientific curiosity about this herbal blend called Essiac. As 1937 ended, Rene's supporters were ra llying for the big push in 1938. Politically, 1938 would tell the tale. The cause had reac hed parliament, and the legislators were going to have to face the issue of Essiac, one way or the other. In the course of organizing their campaign, several of Re ne's former patients took the step of swearing their stories under oath. One of those testimonials is an af fidavit sworn on December 7, 1937, by a man named Henry J. Hneeshaw To confirm pa rt of what he said, Mr. Hneeshaw submitted a letter from the Mayo Clinic, signed by George B. Eusterman. \"At the"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR.

GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 27 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 time you were here we found you to have an inoperable gastric carcinoma,\" the letter said. \"Roentgenoscopic examination showed extensive involvement, including the upper third. Gastric analysis disclose d an anacidity and other evidence of involvement of the upper third of the stomach. We would not recommend surgical exploration.\" Mr. Hneeshaw attached to the letter what he swore as true. Here's what he said: For a year, he suffered stomach discomfort and severe loss of appetite. On May 25, 1937, he went to his doctor, who examin ed him and suspected cancer. After examination by four other doctors in a can cer clinic, Mr. Hneeshaw was told that he had cancer of the stomach. On June 4, he went into surgery. \"But after opening me they decided not to operate as the growth was right into the diaphragm and operation would be fatal. They gave me three months to live.\" He went home and was losing weight rapidl y. At the end of Jul y, he went to the Mayo Clinic after hearing that they coul d do wonderful things for cancer patients. After five days, they told him nothing could be done. Mr. Hneeshaw had heard of Miss Caisse. \"As a final effort to live I thought it could do no harm to see her. I ca nnot express my gratitude a nd appreciation at what she has done. I had my first treatment from he r on August ninth, and from that first treatment I felt a different man. I weighed then 129 pounds, now weigh 150 pounds and am better in every way. The discomfort is almost gone and I can eat and enjoy my food. I feel stronger all the time a nd am looking forward to farming out West just as good as ever.\" Every day, statements like that were arriving in the offices of legislators and the Minister of Health. and the Ontario Prime Minister. They were running in the letters to the editor columns of newspapers. The politicians knew that this was not going to be an easy matter to deal with. Rene Caisse was hopeful that 1938 would be the year that Essiac won the official acceptance and legal authorization that sheand her supporters—passionately believed it deserved. But whatever was going to happen, she was going to make one hell of a fight of it. CHAPTER THREE Probably not even Rene could have imagined the fight that she would live through in 1938. She was in the newspapers regularly all year. In small ways and large, tens of thousands of people involved themselves in her cause. At one point, Ontario Prime Minister Mitchell Hepburn received yet another petition on Rene's behalf—this one with 55,000 signatures. Hundreds of people a week were showing up at her clinic, most of them desperately ill. Her former patients were still spread ing the word about their treatments. To understand the phenomenon that Rene had be come in Canada, it's necessary to understand what her patients were going around telling people. A woman named E.A. Tarzwell from Milton, Ontario read about Rene in a newspaper that published a letter from one of Rene's patients, James Summerwill, a"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 28 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 notary public in Sprucedale, Ontario. Mr s. Tarzwell wrote directly to Mr. Summerwill to find out more. These were strangers corresponding about matters of life and death, and there was no reluct ance, no equivocation, in what Mr. Summerwill wrote back to Mrs. Tarzwell, based on his own experience. \"As we have passed through the ordeal which you are now experiencing,\" he wrote to her, \"our sincere sympathy is yours. But let me assure you that you have no cause to worry over more than the actual su ffering of your husband, providing that the trouble is not too much advanced, if he is taking Miss Caisse's treatment and follows her instructions completely.\" He told of his case. He was suffering from \"the most malignant type of cancer known.\" Dr. Faulkner, Premier Hepburris Minist er of Health in the previous cabinet, had personally told him that Dr. Faulkner had never heard of anyone being cured of Mr. Summerwill's type of cancer. Mr. Summerwill's doctors told him that surgery was the only hope. He refused the surgery a nd got his doctor to write the necessary consent letter to allow Rene to treat him. \"I took 28 treatments in all, weekly, 1 treatment until the last 2 which was 1 treatment semi-weekly. My cancer was in the left groin. From the Sth treatment I could notice a slight improvement at the end of each week, wh ich gave me a little encouragement, and I persevered and gained very slowly but surely. I took my last treatment 24 th June, 1936, and have been feeling fi ne ever since and able to look after my work from that time. But of cour se I had to take things easy for quite a while in order not to put too much stra in on the parts that had been afflicted.\" Mr. Summerwill concluded his letter: \"At th is time there is not the least sign of a return of the trouble. I ta ke the time and trouble to an swer a very large number of letters along the same line as yours fo r the reason that I would like everyone suffering that terrible affliction to receive at least relief and a 90% chance of a cure.\" He attached to his letter a carbon copy of his doctor's diagnosis: \"Lymphosarcoma.\" Try to imagine, fifty years la ter, the kind of public sens ation that was caused by all sorts of testimonials like that published in newspapers and with similar letters pouring into the offices of legislators and Premier Hepburn. The son of Ontario's Senator Marshall was telling all his friends th at this nurse in Bracebridge was curing cancer. One legislator wrote to Rene on January 22, 1938, to offer any legislative help he could give—and to ask for three bottles of Essiac. A woman named Eva Stephens wrote Prem ier Hepburn a long and articulate letter explaining how Rene Caisse had cured her when the doctors had failed. In passing, she mentioned: \"I was in Miss Caisse's clinic the other day when a lady was discharged fully cured from cancer of th e breast and even our medical doctors can find no trace of cancer. I wish you could have talked to that lady.\" Rene herself wasn't mincing any words in her correspondence with the politically powerful. On February 14, 1938, she gave Premier Hepburn a piece of her mind. After bluntly pointing out that her e ndorsement had helped his campaign the previous fall, she took him to task for denyi ng to the Toronto Daily Star that he had promised to put a bill through the legisl ature granting her a special license to practice. \"When I told you that the Medical Assoca tion was very powerful,\" she wrote, \"your"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 29 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 answer to me was, `they are not as strong as our legislature: Now, if you have found out that the Medical Profession is more powerful than you thought it was, and have found that your hands are tied and that you cannot keep your promise to me, would it not have been more manly or more kindl y to have admitted that you were unable to keep your promise, than to public ly deny having made it, making me out untruthful?\" Hepburn relented. The Toronto newspapers later reported that he had arranged for Rene's special bill to be introduced in the legislature a week later. Accompanied by a list of names of more than 200 former pa tients who swore they had benefited from Essiac, the bill, if passed, w ould grant that: \"Rene Caisse be authorized to practice medicine in the Province of Ontario in the treatment of cancer in all its forms and of human ailments and conditions resulting therefrom.\" In response, the organized medical opposition lowered the boom. After the 1937 election, Dr. Faulkner had left his post as Minister of Health and been replaced by Harold Kirby. At the beginning of March, the \"Kirby Bill\" was introduced in the legislature. The Kirby Bill was advertis ed to the public as a way of getting to the truth about Rene's treatment, and a handful of other c ontroversial cancer treatments then in use in Canada. To protect the public and discover if any of these treatments had merit, the Kirby Bill would authorize the establishment of a Royal Cancer Commission to investigate all possible cancer cures. Rene, of course, would be allowed to offer evidence to the Royal Cancer Commission, to be composed of respected members of the Canadian College of Physicians and Surgeons. If her evidence were persuasive, the Cancer Commission would legalize Essiac. But there was a catch. The formulas for all treatments investigated would have to be turned over to the Cancer Commission. Anyone refusing to divulge their formula could be fined $100 to $500 the first time th ey were caught treating a patient; and $500 to $2,500 the second time, and for each s ubsequent offense. Failure to pay the fine could result in 30 days to six months in jail. Harsh measures, indeed. According to the Kirby Bill, the memb ers of the Cancer Commission would be required to maintain the confidentiality of the formula for any cancer treatment. But there were no penalties attached to their failure to do so. Rene told friends that if the Kirby Bill pa ssed and she turned over the formula, every secretary and doctor who got hold of it could—and probably would—do whatever they pleased with it, with no fear of punishment. She was outraged at this obvious insult to her: Dismissing any possibility the Cancer Commission would keep her formula secret, Rene told the press: \"The people of Ontario w ill be paying a group of men to develop something that was developed and discovered 15 years ago. I have developed and proven a cure right here in Bracebridge, and I am running a clinic where hundreds of cancer sufferers are bei ng treated and helped. Why then should I be asked to give my formula over to a group of doctors who never did anything to earn it?\" The press reported that 28,000 signatures we re now on a petition that would soon be"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 30 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 submitted to parliament in support of Rene 's bill. \"I would certainly welcome any committee sent here by the government,\" Re ne told reporters. Bu t if the Kirby Bill passed, she threatened, she would have no choice but to leave the country. \"If the Ontario legislature can pass a law to put me in jail for six months for helping suffering people, I will close my clinic and go to the United States. I shall not buck such opposition.\" On March 10, 1938, Rene's th reat made headlines in the Toronto newspapers. Meanwhile Rene's backers we re lobbying with fever. But these were not, for the most part, powerful and we ll-connected people. One of their main weapons had to be the letters they wrote to the people who were. Within days of the introduction of the Kirby Bill, Rene's backers organized a massive campaign of letters to legislat ors and potential witnesses for Essiac. On March 11, Mrs. D.A. Heimbecker of Braceb ridge wrote that she couldn't make it to Toronto as a delegate but wanted to add her letter to the campaign. \"I had two operations about seven years ago for cancer,\" she wrote to one of the women who was organizing the lobbying ef fo rt. \"After a few years the trouble came back. My Dr. couldn't help me, so I just liv ed thinking I would have to die in a few years. So last summer I he ard of Miss Rene Caisse of Bracebridge. I came here last October 12, 1937, and after I had my third tr eatment I knew that she could help me. I am still taking treatments but I know that I am cured. But a few more treatments wouldn't hurt. I certainly feel like a new pe rson thanks to Miss Rene Caisse for my health.\" On March 14, Mrs. John Thornbury wrote her simple statement to the same organizer: An X-ray had indicated that she needed an operation, but she was too weak. \"I was so weak I was not able to walk alone. My husband had to carry me for months and I could not eat anything and c ould not even keep a drink down. I started to go up to Miss Caisse for treatments in July and now I am feeling fine and have a good appetite and can do a good lot of my ow n work and I know I have sure been benefited by Miss Caisse's treatments. A nd I think I can say I am almost cured. Yours truly.\" On March 15, a woman named Ann Mitchell from Milford Bay, Ontario wrote her \"To whom it may concern\" contribution. In a long and vivid letter, she told a horrifying story of one cancer after anot her being removed by surgery and treated with radium. But they kept coming back. Finally when the cancer returned again, she refused radium. \"I was so burned and sick from this I decided to give Miss Caisse a trial and I am only sorry I didn' t go sooner as I would have saved a good bit of suffering and expense.\" Rene treated Ann Mitchell from March to July, 1937. She gained 20 pounds and returned to normal health. Describing her experiences at Rene's clinic, she wrote: \"From week to week I've seen great cha nges in many poor sick people. If anything I could say or do to help Miss Caisse I'd certainly be glad to do it.\" Rene's supporters gathered piles of lett ers like this, from people all over Canada, many of them total strangers to each ot her who had no way of knowing what others were writing, who had nothing to gain by their statements, and who all told similar stories. Not even the most skeptical—or hostile—legislator could dismiss Rene out of hand with this kind of record compiled. In the third week of Marc h, the Private Bills committee of the Ontario legislature considered the bill that would authorize Rene Caisse to treat cancer patients with"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR.

Fifty of Rene's patients watched from the visitor's gallery. The debate was fierce. J. Frank Kelly, the MP from the Bracebridge area and an ardent backer of Rene's, argued that she had been \"hounded around the country for years like a criminal. I'm not claiming that Miss Caisse has a cancer cure. But I know people who were sick and are well today, and I know that their illness was diagnosed as cancer by the medical professi on. Even if she hasn't a cure for cancer but can prolong life, she should get some c onsideration. Even Sir Frederick Banting does not pretend to be able to cure diabet es with insulin, but he can prolong life and relieve suffering.\" \"But isn't she carrying on now?\" a committee member named L.M. Frost asked. \"Yes, she's carrying on but without fee and without recognition. I don't know whether the committee wants to go so far as to make her a doctor but she should get some sort of recognition. Give her a chance to carry on helping people.\" Rene's lawyer, John Carrick, claimed that \"patients and their relatives are reporting that doctors are refusing to give her dia gnoses of cancer, and that a cabal has been organized by the medical profession against her.\" Some MP's shouted \"Untrue\" and \"Shame.\" At that, one of Rene's patients stood up and yelled out: \"My mother was a cancer pa tient, yet three doctors refused to give her a written diagnosis for Miss Caisse, though they gave it to my mother verbally.\" The patients in the gallery cheered and applauded, prompting Speaker David Croll to threaten to have them removed. John Carrick then read the case of James Summerwill, the notary public who claimed to have been cured of lymphosarcoma, into the record and said, \"I have many patients here willing to speak to the committee if they are wanted.\" Speaker Croll declined that opportunity. \"The government is setting up a board to deal with these reported cures,\" he said, referring to the Cancer Commission to be established if the Kirby Bill passed. But another MP, William Duckworth from To ronto, said that Rene's patients should be heard. Pointing to the visitor's gallery, he said: \"We have to take their word.\" The gallery erupted in cheers. Dr. M.T Armstrong, the MP from Parry Sound, spoke in suport of the bill. \"I don't know whether it's a cure or not ,\" he said, \"but I certainly have seen people who have been helped by her. I've talked to practi cally every medical doctor in the legislature, and there isn't one who's against her.\" Another MP from Toronto, W A. Summerville , said that hed heard from all sorts of people who claimed to have been helped by Rene Caisse. \"We want to help suffering humanity. What Miss Caisse wants is protection. This committee should do something to protect her.\" Then William Duckworth added: \"She shoul d be helped. The Minister (of Health) says that the Health Department has not interfered with Miss Caisse. Well, I say that heads of the department change. They may be gone in two or three years.\" There was an argument about whether doctors were for Rene Caisse or against her, and whether this bill was a premature stam p of approval or merely a way to allow"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 32 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 her to continue without interference un til science could determine the truth about Essiac. A man named T E Stevenson, whose wife ha d been treated by Rene, was allowed to speak. He said that his wife had not been cured but her pain had been diminished. He made an impassioned plea for the bill. \"Why hold this woma n up? You worit do any harm by passing this bill and it's inhuman to stop it. Let her go for the sake of humanity, even if she can only give relief from pain. Then at least cancer sufferers can die in peace without the aid of opiates, which is all the medical profession can give them.\" Then Rene spoke. She charged that doctors were having the clamps put on them so that they would not give diagnoses to people who wanted to be treated by Rene. \"The fact that I can get any results at a ll should be accepted as a great thing,\" she said. \"When I had success, I thought the doc tors would welcome me with open arms. I didn't anticipate antagonism from the pr ofession. I expected cooperation and I have every respect for the profession.\" She declared that she would give her fo rmula to the world without any thought of gain \"if I knew that it woul d be given to humanity in the same way. I have never asked a patient for one cent. I have been glad to have donations of $1 or $2 but I have never asked a patient if they had m oney. I treated them whether they had it or not.\" She said that she would happily subm it her formula to any investigating commission, on one condition: That the medical profession would admit that Essiac had merit, based on the results she had already obtained. Then she welcomed any sort of investigation of her work. \"My clinic is wide open to any investigation at all times.\" According to newspaper accounts, when the time for a vote came, there was confusion and many voices speaking at once and a flood of motions to the chairman. Then the chairman recognized a motion that \"the bill be not reported,\" and a show of hands indicated a narrow margin in favor of rejecting the bill. The newspapers reported that Rene's bill had been defeated by three votes. Rene's hometown paper, the Bracebridge Gazette, gave this account on March 31, 1938: \"Miss Rene Caisse got kind of tu rned down by a Parliamentary Committee last week. They put it off on the grounds that a bill covering all such cases is to be introduced, but they did promise that she would not be molested while working as she has been. \"It is difficult to understand the tyrannical treatment Miss Caisse has received. She has been treating people with cancerous growth s for fifteen years. In recent years the town of Bracebridge gave her the us e of The British Lion, a good brick hotel building. \"There she has treated hundreds of cancer sufferers. Many of these came to her in such condition that there was no possible hope of restoration, but even they had their last days practically free from pain. \"Others who were not so bad, but some of them very bad, have gone away to all appearances cured. At the meeting of a Parliamentary Committee many of these cured persons were present. So enthusiastic was their demonstration in favor of Miss"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L.

It is common knowledge that cancers have been cured, at least temporarily, by radium and the knife but those have failed in many times the proportion in which they have succeeded. \"When therefore it is an undisputed fact that Miss Caisse's treatment has never done harm and has so often done good, even to the saving of life, it is difficult to realize the mentality of those who would put obstacles in her way. \"Miss Caisse is not strong and has worked very hard under a very great strain. She will be away from her clinic for a mont h for absolute rest, leaving no address.\" Within days the legislature passed the Kir by Bill into law, and thus began one of the strangest—even bizarre—phases of Rene's battles with the Canadian government. Reduced to its simplest terms, Rene woul d announce to the press that, because of the Kirby Bill, she was closing her clinic. The press and the public would flock to Kirby's door. Kirby would say no, the law wasn't being enforced, she should open her clinic. Rene would open the clinic. Then someone would frighten her that Kirby was coming after her. Shed close the cl inic. The press and the public would...And so it went for the better part of the next two years. Rene fired first at the end of March. Af ter a few weeks of rest and under heavy pressure from patients and suppor ters, she announced—to front page headlines—that she would reopen on April 30. Four weeks later, days before the Kirby Bill went into effect, she announced she was closing again. The Bracebridge Gazette reported that he r announcement caused \"widespread regret in Muskoka and elsewhere....The general opi nion in Muskoka is that this statute is arbitrary and unfair. The general feeling here is that the sole test of her treatment should be `Does it cure?' and that if it cures it should be nobody's business `how' or `why' it cures....The probable re sult of the new legislation will be that Miss Caisse's treatment will be given in the United St ates and not in Ontario. How do Muskoka cancer sufferers like this prospect?\" Harold Kirby felt enough heat from those pe ople that he called in the press. \"KIRBY DENIES NURSE FORCED TO SHUT CLINIC,\" said the front page headline in the Toronto Globe and Mail. \"Replies to Protest.\" Then he gave reporters a copy of the lette r he had written to Rene's lawyer. The Cancer Commission, he said in the letter, will have the authority, after imishing its investigation, to compel Rene to turn ove r her formula. In the meantime: \"It should be made clear to everyone that nothing in this Act prevents Miss Caisse from carrying on with her clinic as she has been doing in the past.\" Rene was in the same position now, he said, that she was before the passing of the bill. Nonsense, snapped Rene. Dr. Noble of the College of Physicians and Surgeons, she told reporters, had informed her that they were going to demand her formula if she kept the clinic open. \"I regret with all my heart closing my cancer clinic here at Bracebridge. I have battled with the medical profession but when it comes to fighting the law of the Province it is too much for me.\""},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 34 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 The Huntsville Forester later described the scene when the patients at Rene's clinic were notified of the closing: \"Tears be gan to flow down the cheeks of dozens of cancer victims, who had been receiving be nefit from their treatment with Miss Caisse, and whose last hope apparently vanished with the announcement of the closing of the clinic. One patient is reported to have fainted, while others, in complete dejection, had to be assisted to their motor cars. Miss Caisse herself was so overcome that she had to leave the scene.\" The story quoted three of Rene's patients saying they had been given up for dead by their doctors before Rene s Caisse's trea tments had saved their lives. One man told the paper that his wife had been making en couraging progress until the clinic closed. Then she gave up hope and said he \"might as well take her home to die.\" The story reported that a contingent of th ese patients and their friends and families went straight to the offices of the area s mayors, who in turn fired off angry telegrams to Premier Hepburn. The angry letters poured into Kirby's and Hepburn's offices. Typical of what Kirby heard from the public was this, dated May 30,1938, from Mr. J.M. Andercheck of Timmons, Ontario: \"It has been a very severe blow to me as well as to many of the suf ferers to hear that Miss Caisse was for ced to close her clinic. I think it is a great injustice to the hundreds of sufferers from the dreadful disease whom Miss Caisse has so greatly benefited. \"My wife was one of her patients for the la st 3 months and has gained in health and confidence and was looking forward to regaining her health again. \"She is only 34 years of age and a mother of a 3-year-old child. It seems such a pity to take away the opportunity from a pers on her age to regain her health and happiness to which every person is entitled to. And leave nothing but despair.\" Those who were devastated by the closing of the clinic poured out their feelings in letters to Rene. In one that conveys beau tifully the feelings of those who had been treated with Essiac, William Giles wrote: \"Your tragic message received. As I sit here, I am picturing the crowds of sad, pathetic faces whose only hope in life was through Miss Caisse. \"What a Godsend you were to us all. Whatev er will we do without you girls. Just sit back to brood and die in despair. You were helping us so much & now there seems to be no other way out of our difficulties. However, where jeal ous, covetous doctors have made this Rich Blessing impossible for Canadians, we trust & hope that your wonderful services will continue on to hel p, encourage & cure our sister nation, the Americans. We often wonder at it a ll but I doubt if we shall ever quite understand....You made things so nice & ea sy for us. We can never forget you. Goodbye with love and every good wish.\" Rene's supporters were quickly organizi ng their counterattack. On May 30, one of them sent out a mass mailing to all of Re ne s patients: \"We may find it necessary to take a delegation to Queen's Park, in whic h case we would have to have as large a crowd as possible. We are depending on you to join us.\" That same day Premier Hepburn sent a telegr am to the mayor of Huntsville, Ontario: \"This government has taken no action what soever to interfere in any way with operation of Miss Caisse's clinic.... Would suggest that representations be made to"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 35 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 her urging her to continue treatment of t hose who have confidence in her formula.\" Three days later, on June 2, Hepburn wrote di rectly to Rene. In a two-page letter he gently encouraged her to keep the clinic open and urged her to turn over the formula, if the Cancer Commission requested it. \"You have read the statement which was issued to the press,\" the Premier wrote. \"It should be clear to you that no action has been taken by the Government to close your clinic.\" The next day's headlines said that Re ne was \"reassured\" by Premier Hepburn's statements and that the clinic would reopen. But Rene denied the accuracy of those repor ts. She said that th e clinic would remain closed. On June 3, 1938, the Toronto Eveni ng Telegram reported that \"she could not possibly see her way clear to continue treating her many patients while the law of the province places her in such a position that she cannot be free to carry on her work.\" There was a flood of telegrams to Hepburn and Kirby. More petitions were circulated and signed. Angry Ontario news papers editorialized on Rene's behalf. Typical of the editorials was this in the Orangeville Banner: \"Miss Caisse is liable to a penalty if she refuses to disclose her formula. On the other hand members of the Commission and their clerks are protected by the Act, ev en if they disclose the formula inadvertently or deliberately. It is a piece of unfair, one-sided legislation, quite unworthy of a deliberative body representing the people of Ontario. \"It is difficult to re tain one's respect for a Legislatur e that placed such an unfair and one-sided Act on the statute books of this province. Under the circumstances it is not surprising that Miss Caisse has decided to close her clinic a nd seek in the United States the freedom that is denied her in her own province.\" On June 16, the Toronto Evening Telegr am reported that Hepburn and Kirby had been \"besieged with letters from patie nts who have beeen deprived of their treatments.\" That same day there was another announcem ent that the clinic would reopen. Then on June 20, the Toronto newspapers re ported that Kirby had repudiated his negotiations with Rene's lawyers and the clinic would remain closed. There was another public outcry. On J une 23, the Toronto Evening Telegram reported the story of \"a Toronto woman wi th fear in her eyes\" who \"begs\" the Telegram: \"Please do what you can to get th e clinic re-opened. It means my life.\" According to the Evening Telegram, the woman had a medical diagnosis of inoperable cancer of the stomach. She told the paper that two months earlier, out of desperation, she had gone to the Caisse clinic. \"Three treatments, one a week, improved me tremendously,\" the paper quoted her as saying. \"I felt like a dif ferent person, and my doctor expressed amazement a nd said he wouldn't have believed it possible.\" She told the paper that she was \"terribl y, terribly anxious to continue these treatments.\" But when she phoned Bracebri dge for an appointment, \"Miss Caisse said she was afraid to re-open. I cannot understand for the life of me—and it means my lifewhy the government cannot let docto rs diagnose cancer cases, have Miss Caisse treat them, and judge her discove ry by cures. That should be proof enough."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 36 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 While they're making a political football out of this what is going to happen to people like me? Our time is—limited.\" The Evening Telegram described this unna med woman as the \"wife of a man in a responsible business position, of comfortable means. When she finished telling her own story, she described for the paper her encounters with some of Rene s other patients: \"A little old lady had a bunch of violets in her hand. She said she had picked them hers elf for Miss Caisse—she who had cancer of the stomach and could not walk when she fi rst went to her for treatments. There was another woman of 28, from Capreol, moth er of three small children. She had been twice operated on for cancer of the throat a nd her vocal chords had been cut, so that she could speak only in a whisper. She whispered to me: `I've gained 13 pounds since coming here, and the pain has gone fr om my throat.' I wonder what that poor thing is doing with her treatments cut off.\" The paper said that this woman did not bl ame Rene Caisse for closing her clinic. \"She should get credit for it, and should be allowed herself to prove its value,\" the woman was quoted as saying. \"She treats poor and rich alike without question. Some are so poor that they can pay nothing. I saw a countryman with a dozen eggs in payment for a treatment. Everybody gi ves her what they can afford.\" The woman's grown son was quoted speaking bitterly of the Kirby Bill: \"Kirby says if they disprove her formula in the medi cal laboratory, they still can't prevent her operating a clinic,\" the son said. \"What it amounts to, then, is that somebody wants the formula. It's not for the protection of the public, because, a ccording to his own statement, she can run a clinic anywa y. If you had seen my mother before the treatments Miss Caisse gave her, you would know there was something in her discovery. Somebody's trying to get it—and get the credit for it.\" The story ended by noting: \"At Queeri s Pa rk, warm denial is reiterated that Miss Caisse has any reason `to be afraid' to cont inue her clinic. `If Miss Caisse were half as humane as she claims to be, her clinic would be open today,' Mr. Kirby declared.\" On June 28, the Toronto Daily Star reporte d that the Minister of Health had been visited by a delegation of 80 to 90 of Rene's patients and had agreed to join in with them to seek an interpretation of the Kirby Bill from the Attorney General. After those meetings with Kirby, the lead er of the deputation, EF Stevenson, wrote Rene a colorful letter telling her what it was like negotiating with the government. With refreshing insight, he described th e deputation's experiences: \"It seems as though the medical association have the government hog-tied. From Monday to Friday we never missed a day at Queeri s Park and I thought we were getting places with Kirby and Conant until Hepburn came into the argument, and just try to get him to put anything in writing. Al l we could get was Kirby's statement in the press that he would frown on a Commission that would ask for a formula before they investigated the past and present treatments. \"Honestly I believe we can make them carry on the investigation your way by keeping Kirby's memory refreshed with hi s own statements on the subject. It is a cinch we have them worried and with th e Docs hammering at them also, I doubt if the Commission is named for some time, ma ybe not this year. I would like to see them named right away, then we would know how they intended to carry on their"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L.

Even Kirby seemed disgusted with the way he acted, as when Hepburn walked out on us, Kirby sa id he would get in touch with you. But still insisted he couldn't, w ithout Hepburn's consent, give us in writing any assurance that the Commission would carry on their du ties in a certain way or that you would not be fined if you did not turn over your formula, if they should ask for it before they investigated your past treatments. \"But verbally they both were very emphatic that the government would see to it that you would be fairly dealt with. Their whol e argument has always been that the Bill was there and they did not have the authorit y to change it but they would assure us that they had no intention of letting a ny medical association run the government. Hepburn nearly went through the roof when I said that the Docs were all powerful. \"Again I would ask you to open your clin ic and let the opposition come to you, even if you do get fined once. We can surely ra ise a hundred for the fi rst one, but again I say I believe the government are ready to play ball with you. All I can ask is that you be a good Canuck and open your clinic so we can have them coming to you instead of you appealing to them. And dori t let them worry you, everything is going to be O.K.\" But Rene wasrit reassured. Her attitude wa s that the law was the law and if the government wanted her to open her clinic, they should change the law. The clinic remained closed. On July 14, the Bracebri dge Gazette editorialized: \"We predict that if some sufferer who desires Miss Caisse's aid should die while the clinic is closed, there will be a veritable roar of bitter condemnation by the general public in these parts and the target of that condemnation will not be Miss Caisse.\" Two weeks later, newspapers throughout Ontario reported that Rene had finally yielded to the please of her patients and would reopen on August S. She and the government had fought each other to a draw in the first round. The Kirby Bill was still the law; but the government had promis ed publicly not to enforce it for the time being. Both sides were now gearing up for the next round of the battle: The investigation by the newly formed Royal Cancer Commission. CHAPTER FOUR In late August, 1938, six physicians with expertise in diagnostics, surgery and radiology were named as the members of the Royal Cancer Commission. The chairman was Mr. J.G. Gillanders, an On tario Supreme Court Justice. They were charged with investigating several diff erent unorthodox cancer treatments in use in Canada in the late 30s, but the focus was clearly on Rene Caisse and Essiac. For the last few months of 1938, Rene was busy treating patients at her clinic, while skirmishing with the Commission as it got underway. On October 27, she wrote them a letter declining to turn over her formula before they acknowledged the proof of her work. \"I wish to know,\" she wrote, \"whether or not I am to continue my clinic. If you wish me to close, I wish you would notify me to that effect. I do not wish to continue, if I am subject to the penalties of the Kirby Act.\""},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 38 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 The Commission declined her invitation to close her down. They didn't want to get into that routine again. Instead, Dr. B. L. Guyatt, a professor of anatomy at the University of Toronto and an early supporte r of Rene's, was informally enlisted as a mediator. He had good relations on both sides. On December 30, 1938, when the Commission wa s ready to begin its investigation of Rene and Essiac, Dr. Guyatt wrote Rene a long letter saying that she should be confident and cooperate fully in presen ting her cases, especially those with \"a pathological diagnosis and shown clinical progress with a disappearance in part or wholly of signs and symptoms.\" Rene wholeheartedly took Dr. Guyatt's advice . That was what she'd really wanted to do all along, anyway: Get those doctors into her clinic and show them what she d been doing. When the Commission announced to the press that two of it's members—Dr. W C. Wallace of Queens University and Dr. T H. Callahan of Toronto—would be going to Bracebridge in February, 1939, to interview Renes patients, Rene told reporters she was \"delighted with the arrangement.\" Accompanied by Dr. Guyatt, the Commissi on members spent two days conducting the sworn—and secret—testimony of severa l people who had been treated by Rene. Afterwards, some of the patients told repor ters that they had traveled long distances at their own expense to tell their stories under oath. One of them, Mr. George Bruce of Hastings County, was quoted in the Toronto Globe and Mail as saying that he owed his life to Rene Caisse. \"I came here all burned up from radium treatment s. I was nothing but a wither ed rat, expecting to die any day. Miss Caisse treated me for six weeks, and now I am 100 percent better.\" Mrs. J.C. Forsythe, of Utters ton, told reporters that she testified that Miss Caisse had initially refused to treat her because she didn't have a copy of her doctor's diagnosis. \"Finally Miss Caisse agreed to give me treatments. I was a cripple when I came here, and was at death's door. Now I cook for a big family, do all my own housework and all the other chores that a fa rm wife has to do. I owe my life to Miss Caisse.\" Since the hearings were held in secret, Rene refused comment to the press, except to say she was pleased with the Commission's thoroughness and fairness. Privately she told friends that the doctors had examined some of her former patients and admitted to her—and them—that they were now free of cancer. Rene was thrilled at this latest turn of events. But the main event was scheduled for early in March, 1939. Public hearings before the full Commission were to be held at th e Royal York Hotel in Toronto. This was what Rene and her patients had been waiting for, and when it came they were ready. So many of her supporters showed up that Rene had to rent one of the hotel's ballrooms as a gathering place. Among thos e present were 387 former patients, from all over Canada, prepared to wait their turn to be sworn to oath and tell their stories. The Commission wasn't interested in h earing from 387 witnesses. \"She's got an army of people here,\" Commissioner Ualin complained. Ultimately, pleading the pressures of time, the Commission allowed only 49 to testify."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 39 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 The hundreds of pages of tr anscript of those 49 swor n witnesses is filled with heart-rending testimony. To a person they we re convinced that Essiac had helped them to regain their health. Some of them told of partial and continuing recoveries when all else had failed; others describe d complete, almost miraculous, recoveries after they had been near death. A man named George Mahon testified: \"She he lped me. If it was not for her, I would be buried.\" A woman named Elizabeth Stew art testified that her doctor sent her home from the hospital almost two years ago to make out her will. \"It won't shorten your days,\" she said the doctor told her, \"and it won't lengthen them.\" Now, after treatment by Nurse Caisse: \"I'm working every day. I milk five cows, night and morning. I'm right off the farm a nd have boarders and all in the house, and I have to do it all myself. I owe my life to Miss Caisse and I hope you will do something for her.\" A woman named Augusta Douglas had a di agnosis by a pathologist, dated August 5, 1938: Cancer of the cervix. She was told she needed radium treatments. She told the doctor shed rather die. \"With my boots on,\" she said. \"Thank God I had enough will power. I fought the doctors and I am still.\" She recalled arriving in Bracebridge for he r first treatment by Re ne Caisse. \"I went on a bed made in the back of the car on a mattress with a feather tick folded on it, and I could stand no jolting of the car or I w ould get this terrible pain in my back.\" She spent six weeks flat on her back in be d in Bracebridge, having treatments. \"As I lay in my bed I could see the clinic on the hill and it reminded me of the Cross on the hill of Calvary. I know you men do not care anything about this but just the same it was the only ray of hope I had in the world.\" Gradually she improved. She started taking wa lks. After eight w eeks she was able to make the 220-mile round-trip drive to Brace bridge every Saturday. She testified that her doctor told her: \"If that is what she has done with a few, keep on taking her treatments. They are marvelous. They are worth a million.\" Clara Thornbury weighed 72 pounds when her husband carried her into Rene's clinic. Now she weighed 107 pounds and did her own housework. Annie Bonar's cancer spread after radium treatments. Weighing 90 pounds the night before she was to check into the hospita l to have her arm—swollen to twice its natural size—amputated, she decided to see Rene Caisse instead. Four months later, she was back to her normal weight of 150 and her arm was Ok. One witness after another to ld stories like that. But pe rhaps the most dramatic—and moving—testimony was offered, in vivid and often horrifying detail, by a woman named May Henderson. After 30 years of chronic ill health, she wa s told by her doctors that her whole body was riddled with cancer. They would have to remove both her breasts and most of her insides. She wasn't up to the torture of that, she decided, and basically gave up on living. \"My eyes just looked like stones,\" she testif ied, \"and I simply hadn't any life in me.

I didrit know ju st what was ahead of me, but someone told me about Miss Caisse.\" That was in March, 1937. May Henderson went to see Rene, but Rene couldn't treat her without a written diagnosis. So May Henderson dragged herself to a doctor for another torturous examination. \"He said that my condition was such that I was simply full of cancer, and that it was usel ess for the nurse to treat me because I would not last long anyway.\" But the doctor gave May Henderson the si gned paper she needed. She began the Essiac treatment. \"Right away I noticed a wonderful change. I felt more steady and I slept better and I ate better, and altogether I have had about 65 treatments from the nurse. Shortly after I started with her I wa s able to have temporary work and I might say I never have been inconvenienced by the treatments.\" Did she regard herself as cured? \"Well, pretty nearly.\" She explained that she still had a small lu mp on her right side. \"It is about the size of a hen's egg, but it is softer than it used to be, and in the left side there is still some of this hard growth, but it is pretty nearly all gone.\" Commissioner Valin asked if she still had lumps in her breasts. \"No,\" she answered. \"They are completely cleared up....The breasts are quite clear now When I first started with the nurse I looked as if I were pregnant, my body was so full of it, and it had pushed everything else out of its position, and now I think anyone would agree my figure just looks about normal. I feel as if it is normal.\" (In Rene's files are several friendly letters from May Henderson, dated all the way into the 1970s, and always thanking Rene and encouraging her in her good work. ) The commissioners repeatedly questioned the accuracy of the diagnoses related by the witnesses. They said that some of the doctors involved had later denied diagnosing these people as having cancer . Rene's lawyer, Edward Murphy, at one point ridiculed that argument, saying that not even the most careless doctor sent people home from the hospital with two weeks to live without being reasonably certain of his diagnosis. Hinting at pressures on doctors to disavow their original diagnoses, Murphy said: \"If this matter is done so sloppily, there s hould probably be a commission to investigate that.\" These people were told they ha d cancer, he argued, no matter what some of the doctors were now trying to say. Near the end of the hearings, Dr. B.L. Guyatt—the anatomist from the University of Toronto—was allowed to testify about what he had seen at Rene's clinic. \"I first became interested three years ago this fall, \" he said. \"It was brought to my attention by a doctor who was a friend of mine, a prominent man.\" Since then Dr. Guyatt had made periodic vis its to Bracebridge. \"I have not had the time or the apparatus to make a check such as I would like to have made, but I saw patients come in, in very bad shape, and the next time I went along I found improvement in a number of those cases.\" That happened on at least three of his visits to the clinic, Dr.Guyatt testified. \"I was"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR.

That's how impressed I was.\" Continuing to follow the progress of a num ber of Rene's patients suffering from what he believed was cancer, Dr. Guyatt sa id they had definitely improved. \"I would not say they are cured. I would not use th at statement, becaus e a cure of cancer means 5 years, and even then you are not su re. But certainly there has been a great benefit in those cases.\" When Dr. Guyatt finished his testimony, Ch airman Gillanders told Rene's lawyer that it was time to get on the record with Rene s position about revealing her formula to the Commission. \"We have heard more case histories from Miss Caisse than from any other sponsor,\" he said. \"She is th e only sponsor, I think now, who has not been willing to disclose her formula.\" Murphy said her position was the same as it had always been. \"She would like the Commission, having heard this evidence, to pass upon it, and she will quite willingly abide by that decision.\" \"In other words,\" the chairman responded, \"she is not prepared to give her formula?\" \"No.\" Then the chairman su mmarized his own position: \"What she is asking us to do is to pass on the case histories she ha s given us, without the Board having any knowledge of what the substance contai ns, or the theory of its operation or administration.\" \"Exactly,\" Murphy said. After a long debate between Murphy and th e commissioners about Rene's refusal to reveal the formula, Commissioner Ualin sa id: \"You are seriously, I think, prejudicial to your cause in not revealing the form ula. We may be favorably impressed. We don't know As far as we have gone, we cannot tell. There may be something in it, as Dr. Guyatt says. He thinks it is something which should be investigated further. That is what he suggested, to have some independent investigator go ahead, and he appeals to the Ontario Medical Society to have it investigated. \"That is his impression, and he is a disinter ested party. He is not biased. We feel we should like to pursue our observations furt her, and that is the reason why we want the formula.\" Then the chairman said: \"I think Mr. Murphy knows the attitude of the Commission.\" \"Yes, I do,\" Murphy said. \"We will advise you when the next meeting is to be held,\" the chairman said. \"That is the best thing to be done,\" Murphy responded. \"It is understood we are through hearing Miss Caisse's cases?\" Commissioner Young asked. \"Oh, yes, that is closed,\" Murphy said. \"Definitely,\" the chairman agreed. And with that, the testimony of Rene's witnesses was concluded."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 42 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 A few weeks later, near the end of Ma rch, came the testimony from the other side, the doctors. A Dr. Richards and Dr. R.T. Noble, the registrar of the College of Physicians and Surgeons, presented signe d documents from several doctors saying that former patients of theirs had not be nefited from Rene Caisse's treatments and had since died. Rene was present as Dr. Richards and Dr . Noble damned her with all the evidence they could find. One of her patients who had died was named William Allen. After listening to the doctors proclaim that Mr. Allen had not benefited from Essiac, Rene responded: \"Mr. Allen came to me with a tube in his bladder, and in a very bad condition, and they had no hope for him at all. A great number of these cases are hopeless cases, who came to me perhaps fo r treatment, and I tell the family—I did not tell the patient—but I tell the family th at it is hopeless, and I cannot hope to do anything other than possibly give them comfor t. If they care to take a few treatments they do so, and if they go away and die, then these records go against me.\" Commissioner Valin challenged Rene: \"Apparently you say you cannot cure an advanced case.\" \"No, I did not say that. If the organs are destroyed, yes. I cannot build new bodies.\" Dr. Richards introduced as evidence the August 10, 1937, death of a man named Richard Patterson. Rene responded: \"His docto r gave him three days to live when I took him, and he lived a year and a half.\" At one point, Dr. Richards stated that so me of Rene's patients who survived had been previously treated with radium, which was the source of the cure. \"In other words,\" Rene shot back, \"if the patient lives, you take the credit for radium, but if the patient dies, radium has nothing to do with it.\" Dr. Richards produced the case of one of his former patients who had ceased radium treatments in favor of Rene's clinic and later died. Renes answer to his accusation was: \"She was dying when she came to me. She weighed about 83 pounds. She had been burned deeply with radium. You coul d hear her breathi ng through a big hole in her chest, to the bone, and when she breathed, a whistling came through the outside, and she was given up by Dr. Richards. They could not give her any more radium. \"She had no other treatment, and I took her out of pity, and she lived for two or three years, in fair comfort. The burn healed, and she gained weight. I think she weighed about 118 pounds. She was fairly comfortable, to the end, and I feel quite proud of my treatment.\" A few of the reports from physicians actua lly admitted that their former patients claimed to have received benefit from Essiac , most notably pain relief. Even in this hostile accumulation of reports, the theme of pain relief was heard again. But in these post-mortem reports from doctors, it was usually mentioned briefly and in passing, as if a patient's relief of pain was not the point; the point was discrediting Rene Caisse. It was a brutal experience for Rene, listeni ng to these doctors lay waste to any notion of possible benefit coming out of Essiac. Fi nally she said to the commissioners: \"Dr. Noble and Dr. Richards are both bringing up a lot of patients whom I took through pity's sake. They are not taking up my pr oven cases, which have benefited. A great"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 43 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 number of these patients came for one or tw o treatments, and never came back, and I could not save them. I did not want to ta ke them at all, b ecause I knew the cases were hopeless. Every case was given up by the medical profession before I even took it.\" At the end of this stage of the Commission hearings, the commissioners once again asked Rene for her formula. Once again, sh e told them that she did not want the formula taken from her and immediately shel ved as worthless. \"I want to know that suf fering humanity will benefit by it. When I can be given that assurance, I am willing to disclose my formula, but I ha ve got to know that it is going to get to suffering humanity.\" Chairman Gillanders said he wouldn't admit any merit before receiving the formula. Rene said they didn't have to admit it publicly ; just admit it privately. \"I feel that I am entitled to your decision on the merits of it, before I give it.\" \"In other words,\" Gillanders said, \"you are not prepared now to give the Commission the formula?\" \"No, I am not.\" \"You will, however, submit whatever comments you have on this evidence?\" \"Yes, I will be very glad to do that.\" Rene did later respond in detail to the ch arges that many of her patients had since died. But the overall burden of the hearings had taken a heavy toll on her—physically, emotionally and financially. She had taken her fight as far as any one person with such limited financial resources could have taken it. Amid publicity and pressure, the Canadian parliament had been forced to debate about Essi ac—and had come within three votes of legalizing it. She had mobilized what Commissioner Ualin complained of as \"an army of people\" to rally support. And now that the ba ttle appeared to be winding down, her exhaustion and despair—even bitterness—was apparent in a powerful letter that she fired off to Premier Hepburn on April 19, 1939, a few weeks after the testimony of Dr. Noble and Dr. Richards. \"I have submitted a large number of historie s of cancer patients to them,\" she wrote. \"They then demanded cases pathologically proven, where no other treatment had been used. I was just able to present two of these cases cured, as the majority of my cases have tried everything Medical Scien ce has to offer before coming to me. I have many proven cases cured who have had other treatment before coming to me. \"Dr. Richards maintains that though long pe riods have elapsed between the time of the radium treatments and my treatments (even though recurrences have appeared) that the radium is still working on them a nd is responsible for the cure, but if the patient dies, radium has nothing to do with it. \"Now they are demanding that I give an account of every patient I have been unfortunate enough to lose. Not taking into c onsideration the fact that these patients are dying before they ever come to me and are given up by the medical profession as hopeless. I am trying to do this to the best of my ability, but one might just as well"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L.

He will say that the case was too far advanced or that the patient had a weak heart. This is the answer I will be compelled to give in some cases. \"The Committee that came to my clinic, on examining my patients, did not hesitate to tell patients that they were cured, pa tients that I was still treating. They seemed perfectly satisfied, even enthusiastic, over what they saw I gave them the pathological proof of one case that had not been treated elsewher e, and is absolutely clear of cancer. \"I gave a copy of this pathological proof to the court stenographer to give copies to each one of the Royal Cancer Commission, a nd at the last sitting of the committee none of them had copies of this pat hological report, and Dr. Callahan did not remember seeing it. I have since sent regist ered copies to the secretary of two such cases. \"Now, I do not mind trying to comply with th eir request. It is putting me to a lot of expense which I cannot afford, for though I am accused in some of the letters Dr. Noble presented against me of taking all the money I could get from people, I have had so little given me that it has been a gr eat struggle to carry on. I asked for a report of the last meeting and they charged me fi ftyseven dollars for it. When I tell you that my bank account is not one hundred dollars , you will understand why it is difficult for me to supply all the material the R oyal Cancer Commission are asking for, and keep my clinic going. \"I am considering seriously closing, G od knows I have done my best for these cancer sufferers, but if you had heard Dr. Noble and Dr. Richards pull my work to pieces you would believe me to be a crimin al. I had an operation eight weeks ago for bursitis on my arm, which instead of help ing me, made my condition worse, and the surgeons cannot account for that. I have had to work at my clinic with my arm in a sling, spending the rest of my time in bed tr ying to get back the use of my right arm. \"If you can in any way shorte n this investigation, I will appreciate it very much. I feel they have enough material to make a decision one way or the other. I have gotten beyond the stage where I care which way they decide. If you could read the testimonials sent to Dr. Noble by members of the profession, their denial of their own diagnoses, and their suggestions on how to convict me of illegal practice, you would see that they have no intention of be ing fair. If Dr. Rich ards had to give an account of the number of pa tients who die under radium and deep X-ray treatments he would have work to do for the rest of his life. \"Dr. Noble put in a list of patients who signed a peti tion to you in 1937, with two hundred and ten names of patients who clai med to have benefited by my treatment. He handed this to the Royal Cancer Co mmission saying that most of these were dead. There are thirty-two of these dead, one of these was killed in an automobile accident, several went back for radium treat ment when I closed my clinic last May, two had amputations after leaving me a nd died, one hundred and seventy-eight are living. I do not think this is a bad percentage. \"I am sorry to trouble you about this, but I am going down to see Dr. Lewis today, and with my arm in the condition it is, I may be ordered to bed for an indefinite period and I want you to know that I have complied with every demand of the Royal Cancer Commission.\""},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 45 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 But the Commission's investigations dra gged on for months. Rene kept her clinic open, but she was dogged with problems a nd feeling as though she was being left hanging, not knowing what was coming. On November 2, 1939, she fmally made a plea directly to the Minister of Health, Harold Kirby. \"I am writing to ask if there isn't some way that you can speed up the report from the Royal Cancer Commission on my cancer discovery,\" she wrote to him. \"It seems to me th at they have had ample time to decide for or against my treatment. I have put before them more evidence than any other sponsor. They ad mitted this in my presence at the last meeting on July 4 th . If they have decided against it I have other plans and am anxious that they should make their decision one way or the other. \"The doctors have in a body refused to give any diagnosis of a case coming to me. I have people visiting my clinic begging fo r treatment and as you know I cannot take them without their doctor's diagnosis. Would it be possible for you to give me permission to treat any patient who came to me stating that his or her doctor told them that they had cancer, and to have th em sign a statement to that effect? I would appreciate your opinion on this matter.\" In December, 1939, the Commission delivered its Interim Report to parliament. Limiting itself to ruling on the cases of the people who had testified in support of Rene and Essiac, the Commission dismissed several of the diagnoses of cancer as incorrector had letters from doctors di savowing the diagnosis. Other cases were ruled cured by previous treatme nts with radium or X-ray. \"In the 49 cases presented there were onl y 4 in which the diagnosis was accepted and in which recovery occurred apparently from Miss Caisse s treatment,\" the report stated. But even in those four cases, the report went on, the Commission later received signed statements call ing into question the validity of the cure. In one, for instance, the report stated: \"The Commiss ion now has a signed statement from the surgeon to the effect that the growth he removed was not cancer.\" It was a tortuously written report designed to deny any credit at all to Rene and Essiac. Implicit in it—though not stated—w as that all 49 witnesses were somehow mistaken about their own cases. The report implied that \"out of this large practice\" of Rene's, only these 49 people stepped fo rward—completely ignoring the fact that another 3 3 8 people waiting in the ballroom were denied the opportunity to testify. The report concluded: \"After a careful ex amination of all the evidence submitted, and analysed herewith, and not forgetting th e fact that the patients, or a number of them, who came before the Commission felt that they had been benefited by the treatment which they received, the Commis sion is of the opinion that the evidence adduced does not justify any favourable conclu sion as to the merits of `Essiac' as a remedy for cancer, and would so report.\" Having dismissed Rene and Essiac, the Commission made one final attempt to persuade her to turn over the formula. In the last paragraph, the report said: \"If, however, Miss Caisse is desirous of havi ng her treatment further investigated, and wishes to submit thereon further eviden ce, and is prepared to furnish the Commission with the formula of `Essiac, ' together with sa mples thereof, the Commission will be glad to make such i nvestigation, in such manner as is deemed desirable and warranted.\" From the beginning, the commissioners had often said that they only wanted to investigate remedies that might hold some promise. They were physicians"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 46 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 themselves and they didn't mind saying on the record that they had better things to do with their time—and the Commissi on's budget—than to pursue worthless remedies. And yet, at the end, in the paragraph after they tried to write off Essiac for once and for all, there it was again: We want the formula. But why? The contradiction would seem to be readily apparent. On January 11, 1940, after the report had b een approved in parliament, it was released to the Canadian press, which gave it heavy coverage. It was front page news. One newspaper quoted Rene: \"The Commission would not consider any recovery due to Essiac unless there had b een no other treatment previously taken. I have been obliged to treat so many cases sent to me by doctors after everything in medical science had been used ineffectively I have not been allowed to take a cancer case without a doctor's diagnosis, and in the majority of cases, a doctor will not give me a diagnosis unless he considers the patient beyond the help of medical science.\" Four days later Rene wrote an angry lette r to Premier Hepburn. \"I received a copy of the Royal Cancer Commission's report on my work. In spite of the fact that they slashed my evidence, I am still the only one of the eighteen applicants who has so much as one cure to their credit. They adm it four cures, but they say that in two of these cases they have received sworn statements from the doctors denying their own diagnosis. I think I am entitled to copies of these sworn stat ements, and I would appreciate it very much if you will personally see that I get them.\" She concluded: \"For the sake of suffering humanity, I am begging you to support my work and again put my bill before the Legislature.\" Hepburn let Rene's request go by. Two months later, Rene wrote a long letter to one of the local newspapers detailing her cr iticisms of the Commission's report. The letter filled almost one full page of th e newspaper, showing how the Commission had belittled the results she had accomplished. In the case of a man named Peter Hanon, fo r instance, who had testified for Rene, the Commission concluded that an accurat e diagnosis would have been \"spastic colon,\" not cancer. After outlining his case at length, Rene concluded: \"He was sent home to die and in such a bad condition and the end was so near that he was advised to go to a hospital where he would require special medical care. Nothing could be done for him. \"I succeeded in stopping the hemorrhaging, his evacuation became normal, the pain ceased, he increased in weight and is now a healthy man.\" The newspaper accompanied Rene's letter with a full page editorial supporting Rene's arguments and mentioning all the area residents who knew with certainty from personal experience that Rene's treatment worked. \"Scores of patients volunteered their evidence,\" the editorial said. \"Insistence was made that Miss Caisse disclose her formula. Her refusal to do so was apparently based on the belief that if she did so, the finding would be th at it was valueless a nd then later on the medical profession would discover a treatme nt for cancer that would be very much like hers. In this way she would lose the credit for all her work and effort and her patients would not be benefited. The re port of the Commission on cancer seems to justify the fear that appeared to be in Miss Caisse's mind.\""},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 47 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 And with that farewell, Rene Caisse pretty much disappeared from public view—and public controversy—for almost 20 years. She was now 52 years old. She had fought a battle, lived through turmoil—treating desperately ill people one day, sitting in a roomful of doctors listening to them savage her work the next daythat would have worn down the strongest human being. The Kirby Bill was in force and with the Commission's ruling that Essiac had no merit, there was reason to believe that the government might begin enforcing it against Rene. Nonetheless she kept her clinic open for the time being. She continue d to treat patients. A year after the Cancer Commission report, May Henderson dr opped her a short note to say that the Essiac still \"has magic in it for me.\" On January 19, 1940, Dr. R.A. White, in a \"Dear Madam\" note to Rene, wrote: \"For your own information and if it is of interest to you, Mrs. Otto Latondress has been suffering from a Squamous celled Carcinoma of the Cervix for about the past year. Yours truly.\" (Fifteen months later, Otto Latondress swor e an affidavit stating that after his wife's treatments by Dr. White, \"she weighed ni nety-four pounds, and could hardly walk.\" After forty treatments by Rene Caisse, his wife was fine. \"She was examined by Dr. White last Friday, and he found that there was no trace of cancer. \") On April 3, 1940, a few months after war broke out when Hitler invaded Poland, Rene wrote an interesting letter to th e general manager of Parke Davis, a huge American pharmaceutical corporation. She wrote: \"I have a solution that I us e effectively to stop hemorrhaging and have been using this as long as I have been treating cancer. It was brought to my notice how valuable this would be in time of wa r to treat the soldiers. It will stop any bleeding almost instantly. I have affidavits from many patients to this effect, and if you will read the enclosed circular you w ill notice that Dr. B.L. Guyatt specially mentions this in regard to my treat ment. I wonder if your company would be interested in this, and if you could suggest any way that this could be made available for use in the hospitals overseas, first aid stations, soldiers' kits, etc. \"I never thought of this as a separate discovery; it was just a part of my treatment of cancer cases, but now I feel that I should make every effort to make this available to all those who need it.\" Rene still wanted to help people in a ny way that she could. During her political battles of the 1930s, she hadn't boasted of, or even claimed, any special solution she had developed to stop hemorrhaging. To her, it was just part of the treatment. But with World War II being fought, her first in stinct was that this might have value to wounded soldiers—and she wanted them to have it. It was a touching gesture. But apparently Parke Davis ignored it. There is no record of any response, and Rene never said that she received one. So any value her solution might have had to those wounded soldiers was lost forever. At the same time that she was volunteering he r help to the war effort, she was being threatened with arrest for violating the Kirby Act. It was becoming nearly impossible for her to get written diagnoses from doctors, and finally Rene gave up. In 1942, paranoid about being imprisoned and, as she later described it, \"in a state bordering on collapse,\" she officially, and permanently, closed her clinic and left"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR.

It was the end of that era of her life. A vastly different one was about to begin and almost certainly the farthest thing from Rene Caisse's mind was that the new era would end with herand her work with Essiac—once again back in the news. CHAPTER FIVE I know very little about Rene Caisse's life from 1942 until 1959. Sometime probably during the 1930s, she had married. Her husband's name was Charles McGaughey. He was a barrister, then a district magistrate, then a juvenile court judge. From the few newspaper acc ounts about his career, he seems to have been a widely respected member of th e community. There are a few pieces of correspondence between Mr. McGaughey and the Canadian government, indicating that he supported Rene's activities and wa s prepared to write strong letters on her behalf when he felt she was wronged. The old newspaper photographs of Mr. McGaughey show a handsome man with a full head of hair and a nice smile, holdi ng a pipe and wearing a three-piece suit. He and Rene didrit have any children, but he had four by a previous marriage. Mr. McGaughey was from North Bay, which probably influenced him and Rene to move back there when they decided to leave Bracebridge. Sometime after they moved, Rene apparently suffered what she herself later described as a nervous breakdown. After what she d been thr ough, it's not hard to understand why. The breakdown, I've heard, didn't last long. One of Rene's best friends told me that Rene didn't even check herself into a hospital fo r treatment. She just stayed at home and did whatever she did until she recovered. That's the sum total of what I know about Rene's breakdown. Even her friends don't seem to know much about that chapter of Rene's life. For all practical purposes, she just disappeared for a few years. I wish I knew more. But I don't. One of the eeriest sensations I experienced in researching her story was near the end of reading through her files. Rene kept everything that dealt with E ssiac, and also with cancer. Thousands of pages of correspondence, newspaper clippings, doctors' diagnoses—seemingly every shred of paper dealing with cancer—and wh en those files came to me, they came in large suitcases, all the papers and all the years thrown in together. After I had spent days reading and organi zing this massive history Rene kept, it suddenly dawned on me that from 1942 un til 1959 there was almost not a single sheet of paper. No letters, no newspapers . Nothing. It sent chills up my spine. To this day, I don't know if she kept files for those years and they were misplaced, or if there was never a file. In an ironic twist, the last sheet of paper before the 17 year gap in her files, dated January 9, 1942, is a letter from the chief of the Proprietary or Patent Medicine Division of the Canadian department of Pensions and National Health."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 49 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 Addressed to Rene at her North Bay addres s, it states in its entirety: \"Dear Sir: Enclosed you will find license authorizing sale of the following preparation under THE PROPRIETARY OR PATENT MEDICI NE ACT for the calendar year 1942: R.M.C. Kidney Pills, Reg. No. 20027. Please fo rward copies of labels, wrappers and all other literature used in connection with the above-named product.\" After all the sweat and blood and tears she lived through to treat cancer patients with Essiac, at the moment she was retreating into her own private life, the government sent her a \"Dear Sir\" letter issuing he r a patent for...kidney pills. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. But I had heard about those kidney pills in Bracebridge. They were sold in the drugstore. Rene gave them out. People said they helped. Some of the locals still remember them. I dorit know what was in th em, or what they did, but in the middle of all her life and death battles over the treatment of cancer, Rene somehow managed to develop kidney pills—and get a patent on them. Rene herself, as far as I've been able to find out, didn't write much or speak out much on the pills. She knew they were eff ective and she used them. But she seemed to take it for granted, and they weren't a part of any crusad e. Her attitude was as if to say, doesn't everybody develop patentable kidney pills in their spare time? What Rene did with the patent, what ha ppened with the formula for those kidney pills, I have no idea. I haven't been ab le to find much information about the pills—except that some people in Bracebridge remember the drug store selling them many years ago—after that 1942 letter from the Canadian government. In 1943, Rene's husband Charles McGaughey died of pneumonia at the age of 57. Rene's best friend told me that Rene t ook his death very hard. Despite her paranoia about arrest, she had very quietly and ve ry privately—only her closest friends knew anything about it—continued to treat certa in desperately ill cancer patients with Essiac. The hours were long, she was apparently aw ay from home traveling when necessary to treat people, and the secrecy crea ted stress. When her husband died of complications from the pneumonia, Rene bl amed herself. Her friend told me that Rene felt guilty for not devoting hersel f to nursing her husband's illness. Torn between her patients and her husband, she felt she had failed her husband. According to her friend, Rene became even more reclusive after her husband's death. Many old friends and patients didn't see her at all for years. But it is known that she traveled a lot. She took frequent trips— especially during the winters—to Florida, where she stayed with a sister. Another sister was married to a wealthy man in the state of Washington, and Rene apparently visited them as often as possibl e. What little portrait of Rene I have in those years is one of a lonely woman, re stless and searching, and alienated from any hope of ever seeing the world recognize and appreciate what she had accomplished with Essiac. Listening to her old friends —and her own statements made later—I got a strong sense that she had reconciled hersel f to a tragic defeat. It had to be a very painful reconciliation. Sometime in the late 1940s or early 1950s, Rene moved back home to Bracebridge. She was in her 60s by then, and still badly ove rweight. At that stage of her life, and"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 50 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 after what she d been through, it would ha ve been easy to slip into complete retirement and give up altogether. But Rene remained active. \"Now, like Gra ndma Moses, I paint pictures,\" she wrote. From all accounts, she was a prolific artis t, who loved to sp end hours doing her oil paintings of natureflowers, countrysides— and still life of all kinds. The paintings are quite lovely. Not the work of a prof essional artist; but a talented and skilled amateur. She gave the paintings away, to friends and family members. There are people all around the Bracebridge area who are quick to pull out a Rene Caisse painting and show it proudly to a visitor. She passed some of her time writing about cancer and Essiac. She was a good writer, with an intimate knowledge of disease and medicine, based on a lifetime of medical experience. Everything she had learned a nd witnessed after treating thousands of cancer patients convinced her that cancer is a systemic disease, not a localized one, spread through the body via the blood stream, and that surgery, radium or X-rays targeted specifically at the area of a tumor is attack ing the symptom and not the cause. In other words, a healthy system purif ied by healthy blood will not sustain a cancerous tumor. In a diseased system, if the tumor is surgically removed or destroyed with radium or X-rays, the can cer will eventually reappear elsewhere if the system isn't cleaned out and purified. Some of the herbs in Essiac, she wrote many times, acted as blood purifiers, attacki ng the cause of cancer rather than the symptoms. In one of her essays, written sometime during the 1950s, Rene wrote: \"There are those of us who feel that ca ncer is more than a local disturbance in some distant organ of the body. This was impressed on me very deeply when, after making the rounds of a cancer ward in one of our best treatment centers, the surgeon in charge said to me: `This is not the answer.\"' By the late 1950s—with the same pres cience as Rachel Carson who won international fame for her book, Silent Sp ring—Rene wrote in her personal essays a warning about agricultural pesticides and food preservatives, about all the chemicals we were spraying into our environment. Five years before scientific fear of Strontium 90 in radioactive fallout pers uaded President Kennedy to sign the treaty against atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons, Rene wa s writing essays warning of the dangers we were facing from nuclear testing. But no one who knew her ever accused Rene Ca isse of being all business, of having no time for play. All her ol d friends are quick to men tion her sense of humor. She used to say it was the only thing that kept her sane and allowed her to survive all the heartbreak she lived through. Her friends say that to some degree, she wa s a romantic at heart. They say that she liked men, loved to joke with them, do a little harmless flirting with them, all her life. In her younger years, she wrote some beautiful love poems. Later she wrote a sweet, charming poem about younger women. Fo r the wry glimpse it provides into how Rene saw the personal side of ordina ry life, here is her poem entitled \"An Honest Fact\":"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR.

The girls of to-day Do not demand respect they say They encourage the man In a very wrong way. They study \"vamp\" glances And do \"toddle\" dances Nor wait for the men To make the advances. Oh! Girls of today 'Tis a very wrong way. If you want your whole life To be happy and gay Create a modest style And a good old-fashioned smile. It is surely up to you to wear blushes that are true Then you'll find, the gentlemen Will show respect for you. In 1958, Rene was 70 years old. In addition to her writing and painting, she was still whipping up meals and holding court in he r living room with nephews and nieces and old friends. They all say that she was remarkably energetic for a woman of her years and weight. And though the walls around her use of E ssiac were high, indeed—very few people were allowed to know what, if anyt hing, she was doing with it—she was still treating some unknown number of cancer patients. After a gap of almost 17 years in her files, one of the first papers from this later era of her life is dated September 10, 1958. It is a letter to the new Premier of Ontario, Leslie Frost, and it is a stern protest against recent governmental threats made to Rene. \"Some time ago I wrote a letter to you,\" she wrote, \"asking if it would be possible to put my Bill before the legisl ature in order to legalize my `Essiac' treatment of cancer. \"You replied, saying that you had sent my letter on to the Cancer Commission. Well, they sent an officer here to arrest me but when I explained to him what I was doing for sick people, he did not ar rest me but ordered me not to treat my patients. He told me to write to the College of Physicians and Surgeons and ask for an interview with Dr. McPhedran, which I did and was shocked to get such a rude reply.\" After 25 years, the government was still se nding people to arrest Rene and she was still talking them out of it. Rene closed he r letter to the premier: \"The patients who were improving under my treatments are frant ic and come begging for treatment. It is the hardest thing I have ever had to do, to turn them away. Is there anything that can be done to remedy this situation? I would appreciate a reply.\" Premier Frost replied that Rene should get in touch directly with the Deputy Minister of Health, Dr. W G. Brown. In October, 1958, Rene wrote Dr. Brown a long letter, outlining her position and saying, in part: \"I had a man, a Mr. Schwartz, from Oshawa, call on me last Sunday. He sa id that since I treated him eight years ago for cancer of the spine, he has been, and is now, in perfect health. \"I have a case now, a woman from Nort h Bay with cancer of the breast, with secondaries under the arm. She was losing the use of her arm. Now it is localized in the breast, and she can us e her arm quite freely, and has no pain. The primary is beginning to reduce. She is frantic because I have been ordered to stop treating. \"I"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L.

I clos ed my clinic years ago, but patients came begging for treatment at my home, and I c ould not turn them away. Now the onus is on the medical profession. I have to turn th em away. Do not feel sorry for me, Dr. Brown; feel sorry for the ma ny who cannot have the benefi t of this Essiac treatment for cancer.' In January, 1959, Dr. Matthew B. Dymond, the Minister of Health—and a doctor who would in the future play a critical role in the story of Rene Caisse and Essiac—assured the Bracebridge representativ e to parliament that the College of Physicians and Surgeons would not pros ecute Rene without notifying the Minister or his Deputy. \"I gathered,\" Dr. Dymond wr ote, \"that it is their hope that Miss Caisse's activities might be controlled by means of surveillance, and that no prosecution would ever be necessary. So I do know that Rene remained acti ve—and combative when necessary—even in those reclusive years from 1942 until 1959 when she stayed out of the spotlight as much as possible—and the letter from Dr. Dymond indicates that her fears about the government spying on her were not merely paranoia. The government was spying on her. But at the age of 70, her life was about to change dramatically again. After years of living quietly and without attention from the outside world, she was going to be under close scrutiny, with lots of questions being asked, and serious medical people paying close attention to Rene Caisse and Essiac. CHAPTER SIX In February, 1959, a Canadian named Rola nd Davidson visited the New York City office of Ralph Daigh, the Editorial Dir ector and Vice President of Fawcett Publications. Fawcett published magazines—including the most popular men's adventure magazine of the era, True Magazine-and paperback books. It was a prominent American publishing company. That meeting led to Rene Caisse's return to public life, at the age of 70. Ralph Daigh later wrote a 3 3-page, typewr itten private memo about the events that began with that meeting. One of the most fascinating documents of the whole Rene Caisse story, Daigh's memo describes-in sometimes chilling detail-what happened the day he met Gordon Davidson and what followed in Daigh's own personal search for the truth about Essiac. Daigh wrote that Gordon Da vidson was a complete stranger who showed up at his office urging True Magazine to publish a st ory about this nurse in Canada who had been treating and curing cancer patients fo r more than 30 years. Davidson himself had been treated by the nurse for a seve re case of ulcerated hemorrhoids and believed that he had been cured. Davidson had with him a large envelope filled with documents. \"Mr. Davidson stated,\" Daigh wrote in his memo, \"that in his opinion the material in the envelope could be used to produce the most impor tant story ever published by True, The"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 53 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 Mari's Magazine. It was Mr. Davidsori s rather naive opinion that a detailed story of Nurse Caisse's thirty-five years' experien ce in allegedly curing cancer, alleviating and eliminating pain for cancer patie nts, would bring her the world-wide acknowledgment to which he felt she is entitled.\" As a veteran editor, sophis ticated in the ways of po litics and the media, Daigh understood how naive Davidson was to beli eve that one magazine article could accomplish anything like that. It was going to take a lot more than a magazine article to win medical acclaim for Rene Caisse. As it turned out, the documents in Davi dson's envelope weighed more than ten pounds. At first glance, Daigh wrote, they were \"a great hodge podge of newspaper clippings, personal correspondence, case hist ories of persons suffering from various forms of claimed malignancies.\" Daigh appr oached them \"with the skepticism that any editor might be expected to exhibit in connection with the efficacy of a so-called cancer cure.\" Daigh spent four or five hours studying th e material. There were case histories of 120 patients. \"Very few of these cases we re properly validated with pathological reports from laboratories, but some were,\" Daigh wrote. \"In addition to claims of curing these malignancies, the case history reports very frequently mentioned that severe pains suffered by these people were almost without exception alleviated by Nurse Caisse's remedy.\" There it was again, the theme of pain relie f associated with Essiac. Since this was Daigh's first exposure to the subject, he had no way of knowing how common that theme had been. \"In many of the instances ,\" he wrote, \"the pain was reported alleviated after only one, two or very few treatments.\" A few of the case histories reported cures for illnesses other than cancer, including stomach ulcers, goiter, hemorrhoids and subsequent bowel stoppage. The package of documents contained the early petition signed by physicians, Dr. Emma Carson s testimonial to what she had seen at the clinic, Dr. B.L. Guyatt's endorsement, Rene's correspondence with Premier I~epburn and with many of her patients, as well as the newspaper accounts of the parliamentary battles of 1938 and 1939. After reading the material, Daigh took it to the Editor of True, Douglas Kennedy, and discussed it with him in detail. Taki ng himself out of the story and writing in third-person, a common journalistic practi ce, here is how Daigh described that conversation: \"Both editors thought that indications we re present supporting the assumption that Essiac was a substance of importance to the medical world and to humanity. Both editors were impressed by the repeated assurance that patients were taken off narcotics shortly after treatment with Essiac started, and found no necessity for further use of narcotics. Both edito rs were impressed also by the numerous evidences of proof that skin cancer had b een eliminated in many patients, and that such cures were subject to visible proof.\" But Daigh and Kennedy-as responsible editors -reluctantly agreed that no story could be written without new proof based \"on additional patients under absolute clinical and pathological conditions. It was obvious from the material inspected that Nurse Caisse had treated many thousands of patie nts in a rather helter skelter manner and had been more interested in curing suffering humanity than in establishing"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 54 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 pathological proof that cancer existe d, although there was some pathological evidence in the names of many doctors who had allegedly certified malignancy in the patients treated.\" Just as reluctantly, Daigh and Kennedy conc luded that True Magazine did not have the time or the money it woul d take to conduct such studies. True was, after all, a magazine, not a medical research institu tion. They decided they would have to return the material w ithout writing a story. In early March, 1959, Daigh sent back the package with a note saying that it would be impossible for Fawcett to conduct such \"a long and expensive re-evaluation.\" But Daigh couldn't shake off his doubts. He found himself \"plagued with the possibility that this nurse in a remote se ction of Canada might have a remedy for which the whole world was looking.\" Later in March, he requested the material back. He studied it again, carefully, and reached the conclusion that he would be \"derelict as an editor and a member of the human race\" if he didn't do all he could to find out the truth about Essiac. He contacted a friend, Paul Murphy, at the Science Research Institute and asked him to read the documents and give an opini on. \"After a week,\" Daigh wrote in his memo, \"Mr. Murphy returned, convinced by the possibility that Essiac, if not a complete cure for cancer, was at least a palliative, and impressed, too, with the possibility that even though the remedy might not be as effici ent against cancer as claimed, an examination by the proper medical authorities and scientific personnel, with laboratory testing, might prove Essiac beneficial as a remedy in the area of ulcers, goiter, hemorrhoids or skin lesions.\" Daigh decided to take Paul Murphy with him to Bracebridge to conduct \"an on the ground examination\" and interview Rene Caisse before making any decisions. He called Rene and arranged an appomtment. In early April, 1959, Daigh and Murphy arrive d at Rene's home. \"Nurse Caisse was found to be a most personable woman in he r late 60s,\" Daigh wrote in his memo. \"A devout Roman Catholic and possessed of the calm assurance and patient good humor characteristic of a superior individual.\" Their first interview with Rene lasted se ven hours. She told them her story, going all the way back to the fateful day in the early 1920s when she encountered the woman patient with the badly scarred breast. After hearing Rene s account of her political struggles in the 1930s, Daigh concluded that the College of Physicians and Surgeons had become \"stiff necked\" in their demands for her formula, but th at Rene probably hadn't understood how to wage the kind of public relations campa ign that would have won the College's cooperation. In a touching passage that helps to explai n Rene's withdrawal from the world after the 1939 Cancer Commission Report, Dai gh quoted her describing how she'd felt: \"This was the end. I had fought so long, and I was tired, and I was older. I felt I had done everything in my power to assure giving my remedy to the public, and I couldn't do any more.\""},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 55 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 Daigh quoted Rene explaining her belief about how Essiac worked: \"Occasionally nature makes an error in cell construction, a nd when this cell attempts to fit into the pattern to which it is assigned, it is repell ed by the healthy cells with a violence only nature is capable of producing. \"The natural tendency of the normal cells is to throw out, destroy or consume the unnatural cell, and if the body is strong enough, this fact is accomplished. \"If, however, the abnormal cell is str ong enough to get a foothold in the human body, and the normal cells cannot throw it out or surround it and thus inhibit it, the cells in that particular area go wild and the body destroys itself in that area with a cancerous growth. \"My remedy, in some way I do not understand and am unable to explain, strengthens the natural defense mechanisms of the body and enables the normal cells to destroy the abnormal cell as nature might expect a strong body to do. \"There also seems a possibility that my preparation weakens abnormal cells, because I am able to observe sloughing off of great masses of di seased tissue from cancer of the breast, cancer of the rectum or even internal cancer. \"I am forced to look upon Essiac as a great tonic and giver of strength to the body so that nature is aided in removing the a bnormalities of growth which are deimed as stomach ulcers, goiter, hemorrhoids-and cancer.\" At the end of their seven-hour interview, Daigh told Rene that he and Paul Murphy planned to do more investigation. If they concluded in favor of Essiac, they would invite her to the United States to work with a reputable medical center. Rene said that would interest her, but sh e was reluctant to ta ke up residence in a strange city at her age. She didn't want to leave her brother. He was not well and she was taking care of him. And she didn't want to indulge, Daigh wrote, \"in the opening of an old war which she had already dismissed as lost.\" But Daigh had learned that three of the doctors who had signed her petitions many years earlier were still alive and living in Bracebridge. He told Rene that he would like to interview them before he left town. Early the next morning, a Sunday, Daigh and Murphy went looking for the doctors. What they found shocked them both and pers uaded Daigh that there was more of a mystery here than he'd realized. The first doctor they located was Dr. A.E Bastedo-the physician who had persuaded the Bracebridge City Council in 1935 to tu rn over to Rene the old British Lion Hotel. \"Dr. Bastedo proved extremely uncooperative, and even rude,\" Daigh wrote in his memo. \"When informed that Mr. Daigh a nd Mr. Murphy would li ke to ask him a few questions about Nurse Caisse, his repl y was: `I will not discuss her in any manner:\" When Daigh persisted and said that he ha d come a long distance to find out what he could, Bastedo said: \"You will get no help from me or any other doctor, I don't think.\""},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 56 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 \"With that he walked from the porch of his home, turning his back,\" Daigh wrote, \"to a garage where he kept his car, acro ss the street, and apparently drove off to church.\" Then Daigh and Murphy tracked down Dr. E. G. Ellis. Daigh desc ribed him: \"In his late 70s, a very handsome and distinguished looking individual, who lives in a small house on the main street of Bracebridge, and is still practicing. Dr. Ellis was planting sweet peas when we approached. He graciously invited us into his house.\" But when they explained why they were there, Dr. Ellis seemed disturbed. Even though he finally consented to answer thei r questions, \"it was obvious that he was using an extreme economy of words, although he was at all times studiously courteous.\" They asked Dr. Ellis if he had ever signed a petition for Rene Caisse. He denied that he had. Daigh was carrying the original in hi s briefcase. He chose not to confront the doctor with it. He wanted to keep the conversation going. They asked Dr. Ellis if he had ever sent cancer patients to Rene Caisse. He denied that he had. Daigh had the case histories in his briefcase revealing \"that a number of patients were sent from Dr. Ellis or with Dr. Ellis' permission to Rene Caisse.\" Daigh said nothing about it. \"As the discussion continued,\" Daigh wrote in his memo, \"Dr. Ellis intimated very strongly it was not a good thing for a doctor in Canada to discuss Nurse Caisse in any way, and it would certainly be very ba d for any doctor who admitted any faith in her treatment or admitted sending her patients. \"Dr. Ellis' attitude in this respect remi nded us of Nurse Caisse's statement, that doctors had been forbidden to treat pati ents treated by Nurse Caisse after 1939 or 1940, and had been forbidden to discuss her or her work.\" In one of the most chilling passages in all the documents that exist about Rene Caisse, Daigh described at length what happened next: In answer to a direct question, Dr. Elli s would not deny that the situation was as Nurse Caisse stated. Dr. Ellis stated flatly that he knew of no cases of cancer that had been cured by Nurse Caisse. Neither did he know of any cases of goiter, stomach ulcers or hemorrhoids that had been cured by Nurse Caisse. Thereupon Mr. Daigh asked Dr. Ellis the following three-part question: 1. Do you think that Nurse Caisse is a charlatan, a fraud? Dr. Ellis' answer: \"No.\" 2. Do you think Nurse Caisse was only afte r money? Dr. Ellis' answer: \"No, I don't think she made very much money.\""},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 57 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 3. Now, Dr. Ellis, you have stated that you do not believe Nurse Caisse is a charlatan or a fraud and that you do not believe she was motivated only for mercenary reasons. If I understand your answers correctl y, it would seem to me that the only possible definition left for Miss Caisse is that she is a psychotic. Do you believe this to be true? Answer by Dr. Ellis: \"No, she is not a psychotic. She is a sincere, well-balanced person.\" Dr. Ellis was probed for other definitions of Nurse Caisse that would shed light on her operation as a practitioner offering a cu re for cancer, and Dr. Ellis' answers were always reserved and courteous. He was completely unwilling to condemn her as a person, or in connection with the administration of her treatment. Thereupon Mr. Murphy asked the following ques tion: \"In view of the efforts being made by medicine today to find an effe ctive treatment or cure for cancer, do you think Nurse Caisse's preparation and treatme nt should be evaluated scientifically and clinically to determine whether or not there is any merit to the remedy?\" Dr. Ellis paused briefly, and then an emphatic \"Yes.\" The third doctor Daigh and Murphy in terviewed was Dr. EM. Grieg. Daigh described Dr. Grieg in his memo as \"a b achelor in his late 70s and for many years one of the leading doctors in the community.\" Greeting them at his front door, Dr. Grieg \"e videnced extreme reluctance to discuss Nurse Caisse or her remedy,\" Daigh wrote. They had to persuade Dr. Grieg to invite them into his living room. \"In the beginning his attitude was somewh at antagonistic, but as the meeting progressed, he became more cordial and finally he answered questions freely, although tersely.\" Dr. Grieg denied much knowledge of Rene Caisse's activities and refused to admit that he had ever sent her patients or signed a petition in her behalf-although Daigh had proof of both in his br iefcase. Once again, Daigh chose not to confront the doctor with the evidence. Grieg denied any knowledge of cancer cases cured or in any way helped by Rene Caisse. \"He somewhat surprisingly admitte d, however, that he knew of a case of stomach ulcers that had been cured by Nurs e Caisse,\" Daigh wrote. \"This was a man Dr. Grieg admitted had been his patient.\" Daigh asked the doctor what he regarded as a cure in this case? The doctor replied: \"The man couldn't keep anything in his stom ach. He lost weight. He had severe ulcer pains. He couldn't sleep. After a few tr eatments from Nurse Caisse, the pains disappeared, and he was able to eat anyt hing. I kept track of him for a number of years, and there was never any reappearan ce of the trouble. I am certain he had ulcers.\" Immediately following this admission, Dr. Gr ieg \"resentfully attempted to end the interview,\" Daigh wrote. Daigh asked a few quick questions before leaving:"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 58 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 Is it not healthy for doctors in Canada to discuss Nurse Caisse? Grieg refused to answer the question. Is Nurse Caisse a charlatan or a fraud? \"No.\" Was she only after money? \"I don't know how much she made. She used to take a little black bag to the bank every week, but she didn't make a regular charge and I understand the contributions weren't very large. If she had been after money, she would have charged.\" Is Nurse Caisse a psychotic? \"No.\" If she isn't any of the above, what is she? \"She was a well-intentioned woman, who thought she had a cure.\" But if she didn't have a cure and still pers isted in using it over the years, doesn't it follow that she is a charlatan, after money, or psychotic? \"No, she is a good woman. She is not mental ly unbalanced, and she certainly wasn't out to take anyone's money. She may have done some good for some people, but I don't know about it.\" Should a qualified laboratory investigate Essiac? \"I think it would be a good thing to test it once and for all \", Dr. Grieg replied. The reactions of the local doctors were enough to persuade Daigh and Murphy to ask Rene Caisse to come to the U. S. to make a scientific evaluation of Essiac. But when they returned to her home, she greeted them by saying: \"I'm rather sorry that you have come back.\" She told them that she had decided against going, although the challenge was intriguing. Her brother needed her. She ha d had a heart attack a few years ago and her health was not good. She was overweight and afraid that starting all over in a strange city would be too hard on her. But Daigh was ready for Rene's reluctance. Before traveling to Bracebridge, he had prepared a formal agreement-just in case. He read it aloud to her: She would be guaranteed all expenses in Boston to use Essiac on humans with cancer and animals inoculated with cancer. All tests and e xperiments would be under the direction of Dr. Charles Brusch at the Brusch Medical Center in Cambridge, Mass. Dr. Charles Brusch was-and still is-a respected physician. In 1955, he administered the iirst polio vaccine in Cambridge. Fo r many years, John F. Kennedy was one of his patients-and friends. Dr. Brusch was one of the physicians who treated Kennedy for Addison's disease. Kennedy laid the cornerstone to Dr. Brusch's medical clinic. Among Dr. Brusch's other patients have be en many of the most prominent names in Massachusetts, including former House Speaker John McCormack and his wife. The Brusch Medical Center was-and still is-one of the largest medical clinics in the state. Daigh told Rene that the agreement include d the stipulation that if the tests proved satisfactory to Dr. Brusch, then a cor poration would be formed and a means found"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 59 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 for commercially developing and marketing Essiac. After she had heard the entir e agreement, Rene Caisse said that this was exactly what she had wanted for more than thirty years. It was an emotional moment for all of them. She said she would go to Cambridge. They signed the agreement. Rene arrived at the Brusch Medical Center on May 22, 1959. And thus began one of the most exciti ng and hopeful periods of her life-at the age of 70. CHAPTER SEVEN In May, 1959, Rene flew to Boston and wa s met by Ralph Daigh. She was given a comfortable apartment in the Commander Hotel in Cambridge, not far from the Brusch Medical Center. At the clinic, th ree rooms-a waiting room, a dispensary and a treatment room-were made available for Rene's use. Her treatments were to be supervised by Dr. Brusch's director of re search, Dr. Charles McClure. Dr. McClure would personally maintain the case history files. One of the first patients treated was a 40 year old woman named Lena Burcell. Four years after surgery to remove a cancerous breast, the cancer had reoccurred in her lung. X-rays showed her to be terminally ill. She received her first treatment from Rene Caisse on May 26, 1959. Almost immedi ately, her ability to breathe improved markedly. Prior to treatment with Essiac, Mrs. Burcell had complained of severe joint pains. These pains lessened noticeabl y, she told the doctors. She lived for three months. Exploratory surgery-followed by biopsy- on a 37-year-old man named John Cronin confirmed that he was terminally ill wi th inoperable cancer of the right lung. An alcoholic, Cronin was known as a difficult and unreliable patient. When he started treatments with Rene Caisse , he was too weak to climb one flight of stairs comfortably. He was suffering severe pains in the area of his chest incision and was being given narcotic painkillers. Cronin had seven weekly treatments, each consisting of one ounce of Essiac orally and one ounce by intramuscular injection. He to ld doctors that the pain in his chest had disappeared, and he was not as short of breath. He could climb several flights of stairs without discomfort and ha d taken up his old hobby of swimming. A drinking binge landed him in the V A. Hospital, where he was threatened with loss of his veteran's medical benefits if he continued non-V A. treatment. When he got out of the V A. hospital, Cronin went back to the Br usch Medical Center saying he would gladly sacrifice his veteran's me dical care in favor of the relief he was receiving from Essiac. The file merely notes that under the circ umstances, no further treatment was given by Rene Caisse. A 58-year-old man named Wilbur Dymond was suffering from prostate cancer. After two months of treatments, all hardness in the prostate had vanished, except for"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 60 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 one small nodule. He reported to doctors th at he no longer suffered excruciating pain during urination. Russell McCassey was suffering from a ba sal cell carcinoma of the right cheek, proven by biopsy. The open lesion had been present for months. He had not had X-ray or radiation treatments. After four treatments-both orally and intramuscular injections-in two weeks, the color of the lesion changed from red to pale pink. The lesion reduced in size. The central ulcer crater was disappearing. After three more weeks of treatments, the lesion was h ealed, leaving only a small white mark where the biopsy incision was made. The file notes that this case appeared to be cured. Those are typical examples. The superv isor, Dr. McClure, wrote about his experiences with Rene and Essiac: \"After having personally observed Miss Caisse administer her remedy' for cancer on know n cases of malignancy for about three months, and the results of such admini stration, I am certain the remedy is ef ficacious. It is to be regretted that the pa tient sample is so small, although small as the sample was, her gratifying results on all cases are indisputable. \"The sense of well-being engendered in th e patients is heartening and easily noticed. The return of strength and will to do, obvious . The relief from pain is possibly the most dramatic change. In those cases of cutaneous cancer the evidence of quick healing and regeneration visible and positive.\" To supplement her treatment of patients, Rene agreed-at Dr. Brusch's urging-to perform experiments on mice inoculated with human cancer. Initially the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Institute in New York agreed to provide the mice. The first group of mice treated with Essiac was returned to Sloan-Kettering in mid June, 1959. According to Dr. Brusch's records, Dr. Philip C. Merker of Sloan-Kettering called to say that Sloan-Kette ring was very interested in what it was seeing: namely, a physiological change in the cancer growth characterized as \"a tendency of the cancer cells to amalgamate and localize.\" But then Sloan-Kettering said that it w ould have to have the formula in order to continue any further studies. Dr. Brusch and others seriously considered that possibility, but Rene remained adamant that she would not release the formula until she had some guarantee that it would not be \"bottled up in the laboratory\" or permanently shelved as worthless. It was the same old Catch-22: Admit its meri t and I'll release the formula; we can't admit merit until we know what's in it. The experiments would have to continue without the cooperation of Sloan-Kettering. A prominent Boston surgeon who was fami liar with the work being done at the Brusch Medical Center suggested that the National Cancer Institute might be helpful in future animal experimentation. Ralph Daigh contacted the NCI. They were interested, but placed the same demand as Sloan-Kettering: the formula first. So the experiments on mice continued wit hout the involvement of the huge cancer research centers. Here is what Dr. Char les McClure and Dr. Charles Brusch later wrote of those experiments: \"On mice it (E ssiac) has been shown to cause a decided recession of the mass, and a definite change in cell formation.\""},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR.

The doctors do not say that Essiac is a cure, but they do sa y it is of benefit. It is non-toxic, and is administered both orally a nd by intramuscular injection.\" During the time Rene spent at the Brus ch Medical Center, Dr. Charles McClure mailed questionnaires to some of Rene's fo rmer patients. He received back several testimonials from people treated as long as 31 years earlier, includi ng some who had testified for Rene at the 1939 Royal Cancer Commission hearings: Clara Thornbury-treated 22 years previousl y. Alive and well at 75. (She eventually died in 1975 at the age of 91.) Nellie McVittie-treated 23 years previously. Alive and well and still in touch with Rene in 1959. Wilson Hammell-treated 31 years previous ly. Eliza Veitch-treated in 1938. Age 76 in 1959. After about a year, with only a limite d number of patients available for treatment-due to American Medical As sociation restrictions on remedies of unknown substances-and laboratories increasingly reluctant to supply mice inoculated with human cancer, Rene returned home to Bracebridge. She was convinced that the labs were under pres sure to stop cooperating with her. Once again, she was pessimistic about Essiac ever gaining recognition and acceptance. But she had made a friend and believer out of Dr. Charles Brusch. They remained on good terms, in communication and cooperating with each other about the future of Essiac for the rest of Rene's life. To this day, as I write this, almost 30 years after Rene's work in Cambridge, Dr. Brusch re mains an outspoken advocate of Essiac as a valuable treatment for cancer patlents. CHAPTER EIGHT As the 1960s began, Rene remained active. She was supplying Essiac to Dr. Brusch. She was secretly treating patients out of her home in Bracebridge. But now she was also trying to interest large institutions in the idea of exploring Essiac's capabilities. In March, 1960, she wrote to the Biochemical Institute at the University of Texas, telling them what she had. She received back a polite note, dated March 22, 1960, from a Research Scientist named Alfred Taylor: \"We are interested in checking various plant products for their effects on cancer growth from the standpoint of"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 62 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 laboratory tests with animals bearing can cers. ... We are always glad to check materials which can be used in our testing programs.\" But nothing came of it. She tried to inte rest Merck & Co., the huge pharmaceutical manufacturer. Merck's Office of General Counsel responded in legalese saying basically that they would have to have the formula, and then they would make up their own minds in their own way in their own time. It was not a response designed to encourage Rene to put her hopes in themor to indicate that they knew of or had any interest in this opportunity to get to the truth about Essiac. A physician in Arcadia, California came to believe in Essiac. In October, 1960, he wrote a long letter to Rene offering his st rategy for a new crusade for Essiac: Find a \"few trusted physicians\" to run \"pilot studies .\" Then offer the results of these new pilot studies to the profession. \"It seems a dvantageous to offer the results of a new testing program which has not already be en assigned a `thumbs down' position by a legislative body,\" he wrote. And then they should present \"an improved, tested chemotherapy called Essiac.\" But he counseled great patience. The tes ting program \"would take a minimum of one and one fourth years before the date of product availability. This may be much too short a time because of the nature of th e disease. The diagnosis of a Cure is arbitrarily based on a five year period.\" There was a lot of wishful thinking of that sort going on all through the 1960s. But there wasn't the organization or the money or the political clout to bring any of it together into a major political movement or to persuade the big institutions to negotiate a research arrangement with Re ne. And with Rene well into her 70s by now, she was no longer strong enough to fight the same kind of publicized political fight she had waged three decades earlier. Essiac remained alive through word of mouth. People from all over North America found Rene when they needed it. Shed get phone calls in the middle of the night from people in Europe who wanted to get some. In her spare time, Rene produced a pamphlet: \"I was Canada s Cancer Nurse. \" She wrote more warnings about our food and our environment. In one, she raile d against poisoned additives, chemical processing of flours, oils and fats, and chemical aging of such foods as cheese. She urged people to take four steps: \"1. Do NOT eat these foods if alternatives are available. 2. Urge our governments to take action against these conditions. 3. Read the labels (especially the small print) on everything you buy to eat or drink. 4. Patronize the manufacturers who produce foods without added colors and other additives, and who are growi ng foods in soil not contamin ated with chemicals and where they do not use poisonous sprays.\" Even now some of her former patients from as far back as the 1930s stayed in touch with her, offering encouragements. May Henderson, who had testified so powerfully at the Royal Cancer Commission hearings in 1939, was still alive and well and corresponding with Rene."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 63 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 In 1971, when President Richard Nixon d eclared his \"War On Cancer,\" May Henderson wrote to Rene: \"I guess you read the headlines in our papers recently. `Nixon prepared to spend billions to find a cu re: I guess that and the fact that a dear old friend had to undergo surgery and have a breast removed recently has kept me wondering what is going on-if anything-w ith your wonderful work and formula.\" May Henderson noted that she was now 75 years old and experiencing \"usually good health.\" A year later she sent a copy of Rene's \"I Was Canada s Cancer Nurse\" brochure to her Member of Parliament, as king him to get involved in a new crusade. She received back a polite thanks, but no thanks note. In 1973, when she was 85 years old, Rene d ecided to make one last try with the medical establishment. She contacted Sl oan-Kettering and asked them if they wanted to renew the encouraging tests they had done in 1959. Dr. Chester Stock, a vice president and associate director for administrative and academic affairs, said they would be willing to run tests on mice if Rene would send them some Essiac. Rene agreed. Sloan-Kettering was interest ed in tumor regression, so she began supplying them with one of the Essiac herbs. In her experiments with mice at the Christie Street Hospital in Toronto in th e early 1930s, she had determined that this was the herb that caused the regressions. (The others acted as blood purifiers.) She gave Sloan-Kettering detailed instructi ons on how to prepare the herb as an injectible solution. It will probably never be known outside of Sloan-Kettering what actually happened in their experiments with the Essiac her b. But the tests do seem to have gone on for an extended period and there is at leas t one piece of documentary evidence that Sloan-Kettering was getting some positive results. On June 10, 1975, on the letterhead of the Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research in Rye, New Yor k, Dr. Chester Stock wrote to Rene: \"Enclosed are test data in two experiments indi cating some regressions in sarcoma 180 of mice treated with Essiac. With these results we will wi sh to test enough more that I should ask if you can send more material. If you have questions about the data, please don't hestitate to ask them.\" \"Two experiments indicating some regressi ons in sarcoma 180 of mice treated zvith Essiac. \" That one sentence alone writte n by a top Sloan-Kettering official in 1975 should be cause for even the most skeptical to agree that Essiac should be taken seriously by today's medical and scientific communities. (Sarcoma 180, incidentally, is a type of cancerous tumor often used in medical research.) But unfortunately-despite those encouragi ng test results in 1975-the Sloan-Kettering tests came to a halt the next year. Other test results were coming out negative, so Rene looked into the situation. On A ugust 22, 1975, Dr. Stock wrote her: \"I will check to determine whether our laborator y group is not adequately informed on making up the Essiac from the material you s upplied. I will see that the next test is above reproach.\" But when Rene received an explanation of how Sloan-Kettering was preparing the injectible solution, she was horrified. Th ey had ignored her instructions. They weren't boiling the herb. They were freezing it, then thawing it. As far as she was concerned, they were making one mistake af ter another. In an angry scrawl, she wrote on Sloan-Kettering's explanation: \"All wrong. Rene M. Caisse.\""},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 64 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 Her reaction was cold fury. She terminated the agreement with Sloan-Kettering and stopped providing them with the material . (Two years later, in 1978, a group in Detroit filed a class action suit against the U. S. government, seeking to legalize the importation of Essiac for cancer treatment. In his sworn affidavit in that case, Dr. Stock stated: \"We have tested Essiac in a very limited way against sarcoma 180 in the mouse. We have not seen any consiste nt activity.\" But he admitted: \"After our testing was done we were informed that we should have had two preparations for test and also that we made improperly th e injection solution from the dried material supplied to us. We were never provided full information about the nature of Essiac. \") But even with Sloan-Kettering out of the picture and Rene almost 90 years old, Rene and Essiac were about to burst, once again, into the public spotlight. CHAPTER NINE In 1977, the editors of Homemaker's, a na tionally distributed Canadian magazine based in Toronto, heard an awesome story: An 88-year-old nurse from Bracebridge had been successfully treating terminally ill cancer patients for 50 years with her secret herbal formula. By its own account, the magazine assigned a team of very skeptical reporters to investigate. What those reporters discove red over the next six months caused a profound transformation in their attitude. In the Summer, 1977 issue of Homemaker's, the magazine reported: \"Essentially, Rene's story was true. She had been getti ng remarkable results against many kinds of cancer with Essiac, and she had been pr evented from carrying on treatment unless she revealed the formula. Whether it w ould have been swept under the rug by a jealous medical hierarchy, as she feare d, or hailed by a grateful profession that heaped honors at her door, is a question th at no one can answer, since Essiac never stood the test of controlled clinical studies.\" Until the last moment, the editor of Ho memaker's wrote, the staff had \"real reservations about publishing a story that w ould give false hope to cancer patients. The knowledge that our decision would possibl y cause traffic jams in Bracebridge as the public beat a pathway to an old lady's door didn't help, either. But the consequences of the alternative-not to publish-were too ghastly to contemplate. There were too many if's: What if Essi ac works? Even if Essiac only relieves suffering, it must be tested. Clearly, th e possibility for good far outweighed the negatives.\" The editor mentioned their initial skepticism about Essiac and wrote that the staff members had asked each other when it ha d crumbled. \"When asked this question individually, we all had the same answer. Shearer (the magazine s executive vice president) was the last person I queried: `It wa s the day I realized that if I was told I had cancer, I would visit Rene. It wouldn' t be the only thing I'd do. Hell, I'd try anything-the works, conventional and otherw ise-but I'd go see Rene first: That's a pretty strong indication of our feelings.\""},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 65 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 The Homemaker's article then outlined at great length the entire saga of Rene Caisse and Essiac, going all the way back to the day in the 1920s when Rene was told by the old woman with the scarred breast a bout the Indian who gave her the herbal formula that cured her breast cancer. The article described the political battle of the 1930s \"that reached right to the floor of the Ontario legislature, and made headlines all over the continent.\" Rene was vividly described by the journa lists who had come to know her: \"Though Rene was wary, extremely sensitive to doubt, and frightened that at any moment `they' (the arm of the medical profession th at she felt had squelched her in the past) would stifle or subvert us, she had a brillia ntly sharp mind and almost total recall of names, events and personalities. \"Each time we visited her over the next few months, she would be sitting in her favorite easy chair, resplendent in a vivid flowered dress, the winter sun glinting off masses of costume jewelry, her hair hidden under a jaunty sable wig. She was always ready to produce more documents, newspaper clippings, letters from supportive doctors, and case histories as well as before-and-after photographs of cancer patients plucked from drawers or cardboard boxes stashed under her bed. And when we allayed her suspicions by se tting up her own tape recorder as backup, she talked into our recorder about her experiences. She had lived many years with the possibility of fines and arrest hanging over her, and trust did not come easily. \"She resented our insistence on the need to verify every fact. Insomniac, discouraged and impatient, she often expressed the fear that she would not live to see Essiac recognized. In modest circumstances, she s eemed genuinely disinterested in reaping any financial rewards, and was determined that Essiac should never fall into hands that would exploit it for unseemly profit.\" The Homemaker's reporters wrote of interv iews they conducted with some of Rene's former patients who had testified at the Royal Cancer Commission hearings in 1939 and were still alive in 1977. One of the witnesses in 1939 was a railro ad engine watchman named Tony Baziuk. His lip cancer was so severe that it disfigured his whol e face and forced him to give up his job. Six months after he started Essi ac treatments, he was working again and could, as he told Homemaker's almost 40 years later: \"Eat for one man, work for three, and sleep like a little baby.\" The magazine quoted May Henderson at 81 re miniscing about Rene's clinic in the 1930s: \"We liked to get an early start,\" Mrs. Henderson told Homemaker's, \"because the clinic was always fllled. We tried to get our treatment befo re lunch, have a bite to eat in Bracebridge, and then drive back. It only took a minute to get the injection and drink the tea, and the patients used to exchange progress reports while we waited.\" May Henderson said that she was still he althy in 1977 and had never suffered any recurrence of her cancer. The Homemaker's reporters interviewed Dr . Chester Stock at Sloan-Kettering. He claimed that their tests with Essiac were not encouraging, but he \"doesrit rule out the possibility that Essiac could be effective against human cancer.\""},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 66 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 About their interview with Dr. Stock, Ho memaker's reported: \"The material Rene sent him was 25 years old, and only one he rb-the injectable one-was used on the mice. Rene never did send him either the complete formula or all the materials.\" According to Homemaker's, Dr. Stock told them that he would agree to conduct further tests if Rene would give him the formula for Essiac so that Sloan-Kettering could administer both the injections and the oral treatment. Attempting to play the role of mediator, Homemaker's passed that offer on to Rene. \"Her refusal was instantaneous, and failed to yield over the next weeks in spite of our urging. She felt it was futile to go on testing on animal cancer; she wanted Essiac used on patients, or at the ve ry least, on human cancer in animals. Furthermore, she did not believe that Sl oan-Kettering would prepare the material properly. \"`Last time, they froze it,' she claimed. `T hey might as well have been injecting distilled water:\" The magazine also talked to Dr. Charles Brusch. He praised Essiac and told them about his recent treatment of a man name d Patrick McGrail for cancer of the esophagus with herbs supplied by Rene Caisse. The article went to press only 14 weeks afte r McGrail's treatment with Essiac began. McGrail was reported to have gained 11 pounds and was \"feeling a heck of a lot better.\" (When Dr. Brusch chose McGrail as an example, he had no way of knowing that McGrail would still be alive and well ten years later.) At the end of their research, the mana gement of Homemaker's believed enough in what they had learned that they made an of ficial proposal to Rene. As it was described in the magazine: \"In the hope that we might speed Essiac on its way through the bureaucratic maze with no more lo ss of time, we offered to set up a trust to represent her in any dealings she might have with the government, Cancer Institute or any interested pharmaceutical companies.\" Much to their disappointment, Rene turned them down. At the end of their story, Homemaker's concluded: \"There s a tragic and shameful irony in the Essiac tale. In the beginning, a simple herbal recipe was freely shared by an Indian who understood that the blessings of the Creator belong to all. \"In the hands of more sophisticated (and a llegedly more `civilized') healers, it was made the focus of an ugly struggle for ownership and power. \"Perhaps our cure for cancer lies back in the past, with our discarded humility and innocence. Perhaps the Indians will some da y revive an old man's wisdom, and share it once again. Perhaps this story will be the catalyst; if so, our efforts will not have been in vain.\" The Homemaker's article caused an immedi ate sensation in the Canadian media. Newspapers picked up the story. Televisi on crews arrived in Bracebridge-one of them to prepare an hourlong documentary a bout Rene and the history of Essiac that was later aired on Canadian television. Rene Caisse's two phones were ringing practically around the clock. People besieged her home, pleading for treatment. She r eceived threats from people saying they"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 67 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 would take action if she didn't turn the formula over to them. She finally had to unlist her phone and-for a while-accept police protection. Rene received a flood of letters after th e article appeared. \"My husband, Yves, has been doing just wonderfully well, with your blessed Essiac,\" one woman wrote. \"Your formula has been a miracle for Yv es and God willing-we so want him to continue with it.\" \"I thought of you many times over the year s,\" a woman named Annie Goynt wrote. \"I hope you remember me. I came to you for treatment thirty years ago and I have seen many pass away with cancer and al ways thought of you and what a shame you could do nothing. But at last fr om what I have read in the paper and an exclusive report in the Homemaker's Magazine your cu re has at long last been accepted. I only hope it is used as it should be used.\" \"We read of your treatment `Essiac' in the Homemaker's Magazine,\" another woman wrote. \"I would like to tell you how pleased we are with the progress of my brother who has been on your treatment for a few weeks.\" The Essiac was acquired with the help of their family physician, she wrote. \"There was improvement from the start. Now, a bout 8 weeks later he is certainly much better.\" He had gone from too weak to do anything for himself to driving his own car and looking after his show hor ses. \"His case was considered terminal with only a short time to carry on. Please accept our tha nks and wishes for continued recognition of this great discovery and also for better health for you.\" One physician from Coldwater, Ontario had the courage to write to Rene saying that one of his patients had improved over the la st three weeks on Essiac. \"Both appetite and strength are better,\" he wr ote under his official letterhea d. \"She is anxious to get home and is being discharged from the hospital on Monday Thanks once again for your help.\" Rene wasn't surprised. She took all the fuss in stride, and even continued to treat certain patients who were able by one mean s or another to work their way through all the defenses she had built up around herself. But the most significant breakthrough of Rene's defenses-perhaps in her whole life-was made by Dr. David Fingard. A handsome and well-dressed man of about 70 who could really turn on the charm when he wanted to, Fingard was a vice president of the Resperin Corporation, a Canadian company that had interests in the pharmaceutical field. Resperin had physicians on its board of directors, including Dr. Matthew Dymond, who had once been the Ontario Minister of Health-the official Rene had complained to about government harassment in the late 1950s. Fingard himself was a research chemist who was credited with involvement in the discovery of a drug that was effective in treating tuberculosis. After reading the Homemaker's article, Dr. Fingard met with Rene and did his own research and came out of it wildly enthusiastic about Essiac. He shared that enthusiasm with Rene. Finally, in the fall of 1977, Rene was persuade d to turn over to Resperin the formula for Essiac. Her contract with Resp erin granted her $1.00 upon signing, and $250 a"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 68 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 week for the six months Resperin agreed to conduct tests of Essiac. At 89, Rene had tired of battling the me dical establishment. She believed that Resperin was big enough and powerful enough to prove Essiac's legitimacy. Once again the story was alive in the Ca nadian press. Resperin's top executives began giving enthusiastic interviews. Af ter the Canadian Federal Department of Health and Welfare approved Resperin's pl an to test Essiac on humans, Dr. P B. Rynard-the Resperin chairman and a Cana dian M.P -was quoted in one newspaper as saying: \"They looked carefully at all th e facts and reviewed case histories which were very helpful. And one thing they di scovered is that it wa sn't toxic in any way....There is no doubt that it (Essiac) is effective for some types of cancer.\" David Fingard went so far as to tell one reporter that Essiac was \"one of the greatest discoveries in modern science.\" He to ld the Orillia Journal: \"We have found certified cases of cancer ranging over a pe riod of 25 to 30 years which have been cured by Essiac.\" He quoted the 1975 memo from Dr. Chester Stock at Sloan-Kettering saying that they had seen regressions in tumors in mice. On November 25, 1977, the Ottowa Journa l reported on two cancer patients who said they were feeling better after treatment with Essiac. Their doctors claimed there was no improvement in the condition of their tumors. But one of the patients-a 22-yearold Toronto Star employee who wa s not identified, at her request-was suffering from cancer in her pelvic bone that had spread to her lungs. She was quoted: \"I received radiation and chemothe rapy, and I swore I would die before I would go back for any more chemothera py. I'm taking Essiac now and I feel all right. I come and go just as any normal person and do a day's work.\" The paper also quoted a surgeon named Dr . John Barker who said he hadn't seen evidence of tumor regression in patien ts using Essiac. But their appetites had improved and they experienced less pain. In Dr. Barker's own words: \"It's quite possible that there is someth ing in the Essiac formula which stimulates appetite and decreases nausea and also relieves pain.\" There it was again: The theme of Essiac as a pain reliever in cancer patients. Spoken over several decades, by patients and doctors alike. In 1978, it looked at long last as though Essiac were finally going to receive the controlled scientific scrutiny it had so long deserved. In the spring there were several newspaper stories reporting that Resperin, with the approval of the Federal Department of He alth and Welfare in Ottowa, was launching its tests of Essiac on human cancer patients. Resperin's chairman, Dr. P B. Rynard, cautioned readers that it would be some time before the results would be known. \"The complexity involved in a study of this kind is mind-boggling,\" he said. Resperin left no doubt about their own optimism. One of the physicians working with Resperin, Dr. H. D. Wilson, was quoted as saying: \"We know it's going to be scientifically proven by the best minds in the country.\" But somehow Resperin's study went awry. Within months, Rene Caisse complained publicly: \"I think I was able to accomplish more myself.\" She charged Resperin with carelessness in their studies. Resperin denied that, but the study dragged on. On August 11, 1978, Rene Caisse celebrated her 90 th birthday The Mayor of"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 69 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 Bracebridge, Jim Lang, an old friend of Rene 's, personally organized a party for her. Friends and former patients came-some of them by the bus load-from all over Canada and the U. S. to share the day with Rene. One newspaper reporter described the scene as the guests arrived: \"They lined up to greet the guest of honor, who sat beaming in an easy chair. Miss Caisse is short, somewhat overweight, and looks years younge r than her age. Her faculties are very much intact. She instantly recognized pa tients she hadri t seen for 35 years-and remembered their names.\" There were speeches. Rene spent the day laughing and crying as she listened to the heartfelt tributes from men and women who credited her with lit erally saving their lives, some of them more than forty ye ars earlier. The newspaper reporter wrote: \"Scores of those present told the Muskoka Free Press that their only claim to life had been the administration of Essiac, when all other treatments had failed.\" A couple of months after her birthday part y, Rene was asleep in her den when the phone rang in her bedroom. In a hurry to reach the phone, she slipped and fell and broke her hip. In excruciating pain, she managed to drag herself to the phone and call her old friend Mary McPherson. Even in that moment she didn't lose her sense of humor. She made a smart crack at her own expense about how clumsy she was and asked Mary to please hurry over. When she arrived, Mary couldn't get in. Re ne had the screen door latched shut from inside. Mary could hear Rene moaning in pain. The ambulance arrived and the attendants had to tear the screen door off its hinges. Rene was so heavy that they had a terr ible time lifting her onto a stretcher and negotiating their way through the house and out the door. They took Rene all the way to a hospital in Toronto for surgery. Some days after the operation on her hip, Rene was brought home. But her friends sa y that the medication had left her weak and groggy and that she was never hers elf again. She died on December 26, 1978, at the age of 90. She was buried in a cemetery near Braceb ridge. Several hundred people attended her funeral on a cold day in the snow At her memorial service, they listened quietly as Father James Grennan eulogized Rene as a person who \"manifested love and concern for humanity,\" and who wanted only to \"further the wellbeing and health of her fellow man.\" He added: \"History may have further to say about her work someday.\" CHAPTER TEN I don't know all the details of what ha ppened with the tests by the Resperin Corporation. But what was initially supposed to be a six-month study dragged on for a few years. As late as 1981, David Finga rd was quoted in the Kitchener-Waterloo Record as saying, \"Speaking loosely, we al ready have evidence of (Essiac) cures, but the evidence is not sufficient to convinc e the scientific world. But we are getting"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 70 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 excellent results.\" That same newspaper story announced that the results of the government-approved test were expected to be re leased shortly. \"Fingard says he is confident that Essiac does cure, or at least control, cancer in patients, depending on how early in the diagnosis it is given,\" the newspaper repor ted. \"He also has confidence in it as a preventive. He and his wife have been taking weekly two-ounce doses (twice as much as usually recommended) for the past two years.\" An accompanying article told the story of a cancer patient, Murray Braun of Kitchener, who was convinced that \"he is alive and well today because he refused conventional follow-up cancer treatment th ree years ago in favor of Essiac, an Indian herbal remedy.\" After surgery for testicle cancer in 1978, test s revealed \"cancer markers\" in Braun's blood. He was told at Princess Margaret Hosp ital in Toronto that he would have to have four weeks of radiat ion treatments. \"If I had gone through all that, could you imagine what would be left of me now?\" Braun told the newspaper. \"I'd probably be dead by now \" Instead he got accepted into the Essiac te st program. After ten days of Essiac, he said, the color returned to his face. After three weeks, the warmth returned to his body. \"On Essiac I started feeling really good,\" Braun said. So good that he took up skiing again. But despite cases like Murray Braun, in 1982 the Canadian government shut down Resperin's tests, calling them \"flawe d,\" and accusing Resperin of poor quality control in its experiments. The director of the Canadian Health and Welfare Department's bureau of prescription drugs admitted that there was no concern about Essiac's safety. It was safe, all right. Bu t he was quoted as saying that they \"cannot say this is an effective treatment.\" Patients who were already usi ng Essiac would be allowed to continue using it, in the government's words, \"purely on humanita rian grounds.\" On those same grounds, future patients who could fight their way through the bureaucracy might also be allowed to use Essiac legally. On December 8, 1982, a man named Ed Zales ky of Surrey, B.C., one of the cancer patients who had been treated with Es siac provided by Resperin, expressed his outrage at all the obstacles placed in the way of people who needed Essiac. In a letter to the editor of an Orillia newspa per, he wrote: \"My life expectancy in 1977 was from six months to two years maximum. The fact that I'm `clean' (according to our over-worked staff at the Vancouver cancer clinic) and still very much alive I owe in great part to Essiac. I was fortuna te enough to be one of the people involved in an Essiac test program conducted by Resperin Corporation.\" He went on: \"I had a terrible time convi ncing my doctor to submit the short reports required by Resperin to compile test resu lts, let alone to make any commitments. It seems that many doctors refuse to complete the forms, or conveniently `forget' or make them so vague as to be useless. \"That Essiac gives relief from suffering in many cases and prolongs life there is no doubt.

When the government was criticizing Resperin 's tests, David Fingard told the press that Resperin could even sell Essiac as an herbal tea if they didn't make any claims for its curative powers. But Resperin, he said, wanted Essiac to be officially accepted as a cure. \"We don't want to sell it as a tea through stores,\" he was quoted as saying. \"The only way we want to sell it is as a cure.\" Resperin didn't give up after the governme nt shut down their tests-and apparently Sloan-Kettering remained interested. On May 12, 1983, David Fingard sent a telegram to Dr. Charles Young at Sloan-Ke ttering, thanking him \"for your interest in ascertaining the possibility of Essiac cu ring cancer. We naturally feel optimistic based on present results. Also delighted w ith your offer to come to Toronto for a meeting.\" Five months later, on October 5, 1983, E. Bruce Hendrick, the chief of neurosurgery at The University of Toronto's Hospital Fo r Sick Children, wrote his letter to the Canadian Minister of Health-quoted as the epigraph to this book-saying that Essiac appeared to have benefited children under his care sufficiently to warrant serious scientific testing. Once again, after the latest round of cont roversy over Essiac, this time sparked by the Homemaker's article in 1977, the author ities did everything in their power to discredit and dismiss Essiac-and yet Essiac just would not disappear and die. Cancer patients continued to speak out in its support. Some physicians who had worked with it were willing to risk censure to push for more research. That's been the story of Essiac for more than sixty years now, ever since those eight physicians signed that first petition to the Canadian government in the 1920s. Rene Caisse could never have dreamed when t hose first doctors showed up at her front door to arrest her, and then refused to do it after they heard what she had to say, that she had just experienced the perfect metaphor for the next sixty years of Essiac. And so the battle continues. In my case, I had never even heard of Essiac until 1985. When I did first hear of it, I certainly wasn't looking to commit my life to an uphill struggle, any more than Rene Caisse was when she casually asked that woman what had happened to her breast. In 1985, I was devoting all my attention to my thriving chiropractic practice in Los Angeles, where I treat a la rge roster of patients w ho include some of the most successful professional athletes in th e world. Among my patients are track stars, worldclass weight lifters, both men and women, and members of NFL teams. Previously I had spent five years developi ng a new technique that offers my patients important benefits in the healing of inju red muscles and the re lief of pain. I was contracted, for instance, by the Baptist Hosp ital in Nashville, Tennessee, one of the largest orthopedic hospitals in southern America, to instruct them in how to implement that technique into the programs of their pain control unit.

I feel that I am a success in my chosen career, respected in my field, with a long list of present and former pa tients who will vouch for my integrity and sincerity in anything I undertake. One day in 1985 a friend of mine introdu ced me to a woman who was striking in how private she was about herself. My memories of this woman are fresh. Ce rtain phrases and words remain indelibly with me, along with her tones and expressions. She gave the impression of great fragility. Small and raw-boned, she had obvious ly lost weight. Her appearance was one of delicate survival, a balance between life and disappearance from life. As we got to know each other and she came to trust me and respond to my curiosity, she began to tell me the story of Rene Caisse and Essiac. She had met Rene many years earlier when she had gone to Rene fo r treatment of her cancer. She had been in remission ever since. She regarded it as a miracle. She and Rene had become close friends. She told me of the life and death struggles Rene had lived through for so long. She talk ed easily and willingly of Rene Caisse, but of the formula for Essiac, she spoke sparingly and with difficulty. Always, a silent dialog within her seemed to be in progress. Eventually she admitted to me that Rene had left her a copy of the formula. As gently as possible I began trying to persuade her to trust me with it. Rene had freely given it to this woman, who had guarded it w ith complete inflexibility for years, and now here was someone else, once again, asking that the formula for Essiac be released. I realized that for this woma n to pass on the formula was an ultimate act of trust, and also her acknowledgment that she had, in some way, finally made her choice and passed on her role in what would happen to Essiac. It was an agonizing time for all concerned as doubts, suspicions and fears came and went and came again. Our conversations, interrupted by days or weeks of withdrawal and silence by this woman, stretched over almost a year. It was a humbling experience. I learned patience. I learned how to wait. The break came during one of those difficult periods of hi atus. This was the third or fourth time I had been put on hold, and I was braced for the wo rst. But when the break came, there was no ceremony. Merely an indistinct message on the tape of my answering machine saying: \"Come now \" I flew to the city where she lives, then anxiously waited in my hotel room for se veral hours. I had a contract drawn up that defined our responsibilities to each other, and to Rene and her formula, in great detail. But none of that turned out to be wanted or necessary. When I arrived at her home, there was a soft silence for some time. She stirred in her chair and said, \"Well, all in God's good tim e.\" Then another long silence. Then her eyes, normally a faded blue, were burning. She said, \"Gary, there are things better learned by you only when they happen to you.\" And she handed me a sheet of paper with a list of herbs, typed out, and the instructions for brewing the tea. She didn't feel like visiting, so I rose and le ft and returned to Los Angeles, with a formula and my belief that what this woman had told me was true. But I had no proof."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 73 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 The first thing I did was brew a batch of Essiac for myself. This woman had told me that its preventive powers were awesome; that Rene had drunk the tea every day of her life. And sure enough, within two days I felt fitter than I had felt before. I had been suffering from chronic bronchitis. The bronchitis disappeared. I have been taking the Essiac ever since. It has done me nothing but good. But that still wouldn't be proof to anyone else. To begin finding that proof, I had only one solid lead: the name of Rene's closest friend, a woman who lived and worked alongside Rene off and on for many years, ever since Rene had cured this woman's mother of cancer in the 1930s. Rene's friend's name was Mary McPherson and she was a native of northern Ontario. That was all I knew I finally tracked down her phone number, and when I did it was in-why was I surprised? -Bracebridge. I called and told her about my conversati ons with Rene's other friend-though not that I had the formula-and asked if I could meet with Mary in Bracebridge. I could tell that she was suspicious, wary of this stranger, but she agreed to see me. I flew to Toronto and drove the 170 kilome ters to Bracebridge in a blizzard. The snow was so thick and heavy that I could ba rely see the road in front of me. I don't recall seeing another vehicle for the whole journey. As I pulled into Bracebridge for the first time, it was hard to believe that this little country town, surrounded by wooded hills and carpeted in snow, had been the center of such controversy for so many decades . Built near the banks of the Muskoka River, it's a lovely town, clean and well -tended, with rows of victorian houses and big front yards. The population is about 9, 300-with thousands more who visit in the summer to enjoy the area s water sports and outdoors life. The rustic buildings on the main street ar e occupied with shops and stores. There is one movie theater that shows the latest rele ases. Bracebridge has the appearance of a solid community that is thriving economically. I drove down Dominion Street, and there was the red brick building, the old British Lion Hotel, where sick people could line up for treatment only if they had a written statement from a doctor stating that they were sure to di e-and so were now free to do as they wished. I knew that here in this town were Rene's records, in Mary's care, long secured in boxes and waiting for someone to come fo r them once more. I knew that Rene had kept every piece of paper-the dia gnoses from doctors, correspondence with Sloan-Kettering, with Premier Hepburn, with her thousands of patients, all the newspaper clippings, the parliamentary te stimony. Everything. There were said to be records of everyone she had treated, wr itten in copperplate scrawls on yellowed paper. I desperately wanted to see it all. I was consumed with the idea that I wanted the whole truth from Mary. I had to \"know it a ll.\" At the beginning of our first meeting on that bright, crisp, snowy morning, Mary seemed disillusioned and cynical. She had the same guarded manner I had encountered with Rene's other friend. If I had known then what hell Rene and they had lived through for most of their lives, I would have expected her to turn me away at the door."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 74 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 Mary later told me that there had been so many doctors, lawyers and corporations pursuing the formula that she couldn't take much more of the pressure. She said that she had made a promise to Rene-when Re ne was on her death bed-that she would never reveal the formula to anyone, and she said she would never break that promise. I think that was probably Mary's polite way of saying that if getting the formula was what I had in mind, I might as well forget it, just pack up and go home and leave her alone. I promised her that I would not ask her to give me the formula, and she seemed to relax a little. As we talked she told me he r own story: At different times in the twenty years or so after Rene cured Mary 's mother of cancer, Mary and her husband Cliff had each had cancer, a nd Rene had cured them bot h with Essiac. With what she'd seen, there was absolutely no doubt in Mary's mind about the value of Essiac. After Mary became Rene's best friend, she watched Rene go through the hell of threatened arrests, promises of millions of dollars, even death threats from desperate people she had to turn away for lack of proper documentation-and all because Rene wanted to cure a deadly disease and not charge for doing it. We talked for eight hours. I think Mary could see how sincere my interest was. As she reminisced about Rene, she seemed to enjoy herself. Her spirits picked up. \"She saw it all,\" Mary said. \"She even had quite a joke with the ja iler right across the street from the clinic. Because she was so big, he used to say, `Don't worry, Rene, I'll reenforce the floor. I know you're going to be with me one of these days.\" Once when some official s howed up with a warrant to arrest her, Rene went and put her coat on, then asked him what the ch arge was. He told her it was giving unauthorized medicine for cancer. \"Rene said, `Well, if it's an offense in our great land of Canada to save live s, then I guess I'm guilty and I'm ready to go: And the official tore up the warrant and le ft. They never did arrest her.\" The years of the clinic were Rene's ha ppiest years, Mary said. \"She was a happy person when she had the clinic. She helped a lot of people and that was always her aim in life: to help people. A lot of our local doctors thought the world of her. They'd drive their own patients in their ow n cars to be treated by Rene. Dr. Bastedo drove his patients to the clinic. But he got too loud about it, I guess, and the medical association stepped on him. They told hi m he couldn't do that any more. What was the man to do, eh? That was his life. So he stopped.\" Mary told me a story about Rene when she was a young nurse that sort of summed it all up for me. \"She was attending an expect ant mother who was going to give birth in her home. The doctors came and made their examination and left. They said they'd be back at a certain time. This was before most people had telephones. They left Rene in charge and before they cam e back, the mother's labor quickened. Rene saw that the baby was in the wrong position. The baby had to be turned to save the mother's life. So Rene did it. \"Mother and child were resting comfortabl y when the doctors returned. The doctors were horrified at what she'd done. On e of them said, `D on't you know you could have been sued if things had not turned out well?' Rene said, `Yes, but if I hadn't done anything, the girl would ha ve died. Then what?' That's just the way Rene was"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 75 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 all her life. She used to laugh about that story and say that everything had a funny side. She said the expressions on t hose doctors faces were priceless.\" That night I took Mary to dinner, and I w ill never forget the look on her face when I recited to her the list of herbs that make up Essiac. She was shocked. Her eyes went the size of silver dollars. For a moment I thought she was going to be outraged. \"How did you get that?\" she snapped at me. But then she collected herself and sighed, a deep sigh, as if she were relieved, glad that someone she trusted finally had it without her breaking any promises. Later that evening she opened up complete ly, smiled a lot, confirmed the accuracy of the formula, and finally she said: \"I don't know why I'm going to do this, but I trust you and I'm going to let you have the documents that no one has seen since Rene gave them to me.\" Mary was as good as her word. Over the ne xt few months, I made two more trips to Bracebridge, becoming closer to Mary each time, hearing more of the story, and returning with large suitcases filled with papers. It took me two weeks just to read all those papers. By the time I was finished reading, I knew I had more research to do, but I was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that Essiac was effective-at the very least for its pain relief qualities-as a treatment for cancer. I was certain that my initial faith was backed up with cold, hard fact. Reading those papers the first time wa s, for instance, how I learned of Rene's work with Dr. Charles Brusch. CHAPTER ELEVEN When I first lear ned of Rene Caisse's work with Dr. Charles Brusch three decades ago, I thought it would be too good to be true that I might be able to locate him and persuade him to talk with a stranger about his use of a cancer remedy that was not accepted by the American Medi cal Association-and that might make him a source of controversy. How wrong I was. The Brusch Medical Cent er is still in ope ration and still one of the largest medical clinics in Massachusetts . It has a staff of about 40, most of them specialists, and Dr. Brusch-now in his late 70s-is still involved on a part-time basis. Dr. Brusch took my first long-distance phone call. When he was actually on the other end of the line and I began to explai n who I was and what I wanted to ask him about, I was expecting the same kind of guarded-even fearful-response that Ralph Daigh and Paul Murphy had gotten from the three doctors in Bracebridge. But the moment I mentioned Rene Caisse, Dr. Brusch reacted with enthusiasm. It was as if I'd said the magic word. He was thrilled that after all these years someone was finally going to tell her story-and present to the public the available information about Essiac. In my first phone call to him, we talked for an hour and a half. He was happy to"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 76 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 reminisce about Rene Caisse. \"She was just a young women when she started and she died at 90,\" he said. \"That three-stor y clinic of hers was jammed. In this little town, she picked up 55,000 signatures. People raised such a fuss that they had to give her permission to treat cancer.\" I asked what she was like as a person. \"S he was a kind, gentle, stocky woman,\" he said. \"She was remarkable, a real saint.\" When she arrived in Cambridge, he said, she was still relying primarily on intramuscular inje ctions of Essiac in her treatment. But he worked with her to refine the form ula so that the injections would no longer be necessary. They could rely on the oral treatment, merely drinking the tea. \"We worked it out,\" Dr. Brusch said, \"and found out that there was too much by injection. You couldn't give it as often as you should, so we changed it over to sticking mostly with the liquid form.\" I couldn't believe how outspoken he was on the subject of Essiac. At one point, he said to me without any hesitation in his voice: \"I know Essiac has curing potential. It can lessen the condition of the individual, control it, and it can cure it.\" As far as Dr. Brusch is concerned, afte r being involved with Essiac since 1959, that is a well-established matter of fact. That the cancer establishment has ignored Essiac and still does not include it on their list of accepted cancer treatments doesn't change that fact one bit for Dr. Brusch. I asked him about the tests on mice conducted by Sloan-Kettering in 1959. He remembered them, quoting from their memo that he had received: \"Enclosed are test data in two experiments indi cating some regressions in 180 sarcoma of mice treated with Essiac. With these results, we will wish to test enough more that I should ask if you can send more material.\" But Sloan-Kettering, Dr. Brusch said, wanted the formula as part of the deal. \"They said to her, `You'd better send us more material and the formula:\" I asked Dr. Brusch: Why, after all thes e years and all these cases, have the governments and pharmaceutical corporations and cancer research institutions failed to give Essiac the serious research-and application-it so obviously deserves? Dr. Brusch was reluctant to draw conc lusions. It was the one moment in our 90-minute talk when he hesitated, when I got the feeling that he was holding back. I could tell Dr. Brusch was wrestling with hi mself as he spoke, his cryptic remarks an attempt to communicate without really saying what he believed. But even with his best attempt to be po lite and avoid criticizing anyone, here is what Dr. Brusch had to say: \"The trouble is ....all these centers that have gotten a tremendous amount of grants and done tremendous amounts of work, you don't seem to see much difference....These ot her companies, I can't understand.... Sloan-Kettering, they tell you there's a recessi on in the growth of the carcinoma and keep wanting medicine, well, there's some merit to it. \"You've got to wonder. Is it for mercenar y acts? A lot of reports have been written about cancer and all and al ways a hope of getting close to it, but....we don't get anywhere. \"The medications you can buy now-well, the action of that medication, a lot of it, isn't good....But they're making a great penny on it. Why should they go ahead and-I"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 77 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 don't know It surprises me....But now-I don't know. A lot of people are getting large sums.\" But as soon as the conversation returned to the blessing of Essiac, Dr. Brusch's enthusiasm and openness returned. \"I know: the stuff works,\" he said to me. \"I t's very inexpensive. You can get a gallon of the stuff for about $40, tr ansportation and all. Just try and get radiation and chemotherapy-and see what it'll cost you. \"And it (Essiac) works! If it doesn't cure them, it will help them. There are no side effects. They're just herbs. There's no a ddition of preservatives or anything at all. You can continue using your other medi cations-heart, blood pressure, anything you want. There doesn't seem to be any reaction at all. \"If they (the patients) can go 11 or 12 year s when they're told they're going to get two years, and the lymphs clear up and th ey do fine and gain weight-why don't they give it a try? \"Rene's the one who carried the tradition ove r from the Indians to us, and it's worked better than all the (other) traditions that ha ve been handed over. It helps. It helps.\" Dr. Brusch encouraged me to continue my research and said that whenever I could get to Boston, he would be happy to meet with me and share some of the case histories of people he has tr eated with Essiac over the ye ars. There were a few, in particular, that he was proud of and who had given him permission to discuss their cases publicly. They, too, wanted to do wh at they could to help by waiving the confidentiality of their medical records. Then he mentioned that he included hims elf in that group. In 1973, Dr. Brusch said, he had had cancer. He had three operations . \"I had the Essiac,\" he said, \"and so I was able to take it and I'm still taking it now. And I had a te st done a few months ago, and I've been negative.\" He said he was convinced that Essiac had played an important role in keeping him free of cancer. Not long after our phone conversation, I calle d Dr. Brusch and asked if this would be a good time for me to see him in Cambridge. He said yes, and invited me to spend a Saturday afternoon with him at his home. He would have his files ready for me. I think he was as excited about the opportunity to tell his story as I was about the opportunity to hear it. On a lovely New England autumn day, I dr ove along the Charles River, then through Harvard Square, which was bustling with acti vity, as always, and past the colonial homes with their rich history. A plaque in front of one identif ied it as the home of the poet Longfellow. A few blocks away, on a quiet, tree-lined street of two- story houses that date from the l9 th century was Dr. Brusch's home of the last many years. Dr. Brusch and his wife, Jane, greeted me at the front door. They're a handsome couple. Jane is probably in her 40s, a warm and gracious woman. Dr. Brusch is distinguished looking, with a full head of gray hair, a warm smile and an alert twinkle in his eyes. On a Saturday afte rnoon he was wearing a well-tailored dark suit and tie. I smiled at that. I was charme d that the doctor would dress formally to"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 78 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 greet someone who'd just arrived from southern California. But the formality was only in his clothes. I was quickly made to feel at home, a welcome guest. Dr. Brusch gave me a tour of his home and told me a bit of its history. Hanging on the wall in a hallway was a photograph of Jack and Jackie Kennedy with Dr. Brusch. The dining room table was covered with files and papers that Dr. Brusch had collected from the Medical Ce nter to go over with me. We sat at the table and Dr. Brusch told me a bit of his own history as a doctor. As a practicing MD for more than 50 years, he had long been interested in nature's ways of healing the ill. Many years ago, as a supplement to standa rd medical techniques, Dr. Brusch had studied the curative powers of sea kelp and various herbs. He had also studied the value of nutrition in preventing and treating illness. So he was not inherently hostile in 1959 wh en he first heard about Rene Caisse's cancer treatment that was based on an herbal formula. After seeing the results on the patients she treated, he knew that Essiac had value. No question about it. After Rene returned to Bracebridge, Dr. Brus ch continued to receive Essiac from her and give it to patients who had no other hope. He found that Essiac worked better on people who hadn't had radiation treatment s. It did work on people who'd had radiation. Not as fast and not as well-but it helped. Then we got into the spec ific case histories. Knowi ng that many in the medical establishment-of which Dr. Brusch himsel f is a respected member-scoff at personal testimonials, no matter how impassione d, and accounts of cures that can be dismissed as anecdotal, Dr. Brusch made it an important point that he wanted to read some of his own carefully documented cases into the record. He had with him the medical papers-the lab reports and such-that supported every statement he made. There were two cases in particular that he regarded as difficult, if not impossible, to deny. The first was the 1975 case of a man name d Patrick \"Sonny\" McGrail-who had been mentioned in the Homemaker's article in 1977. Dr. Brusch had known him for years. \"One day he called me up,\" Dr. Brusch sa id, \"and he told me, `I've got something wrong with my stomach: I said, `Well, co me on over, Sonny.' I found out he had a swelling and a lump in the lower part of the esophagus. I said, `Sonny, you're going to have to have a little surgical treatment here.\"' McGrail was operated on at New England Ba ptist Hospital. The surgeon told Dr. Brusch that the diagnosis was esophageal cancer. After the operation, McGrail was given radi ation treatments. Reading from his case file, Dr. Brusch said that McGrail's weight dropped to 109 pounds. \"He called me up and said, `Will you please see me? I'm going to die. I can't eat. I can't sleep. I'm losing weight. I've got severe pain. I'll be dead in two years.\"' Dr. Brusch told him to come on over. \"I ha d the material all there, the Essiac, the powder and liquid we used to make it up. I kept giving him that, and I loaded him up with the vitamins and nutrition. He improved right along, went up to 125 pounds.\""},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 79 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 Years later, McGrail's surgeon wrote in his hospital report: \"Mr. McGrail is doing well and essentially asymptomatic and looks better than he has over the past couple of years. He saw Dr. Brusch one week ago and everything was fine with his checkup. On examination, head and neck are negative. Lumps are nice and clear. Heart sounds are fine. Abdominal examinat ion is unremarkable... We are delighted with his progress.\" On February 15, 1979, Patrick McGrail wrote to Dr. Brusch: \"This is a note to let you know what Essiac has done for me . I was operated on on February 2 nd , 1975, for esophageal cancer. After about two w eeks my doctor that operated on me put me on radium treatments. I had 11 treatments in 11 days and I lost 12 1/2 pounds. I kept losing weight after that from 156 to 109. Lo st my appetite, could not sleep and was very weak. \"Dr. Brusch gave me a bottle of Essiac to see what it would do for me. I was just using it one week when I started to impr ove and put on weight . I went from 109 to 130 pounds in six months, and the pain ease d. That will be two years ago, February l9 th . \"I used to take one ounce of it every night before going to bed. Last November the doctor could not get it, so when I stopped taking it, I started losing weight again. No energy. If Dr. Brusch did not give it to me , I would not be alive today. I do hope that it will soon be available for cancer patients.\" That note had been written eight years ear lier. I asked Dr. Brusch what happened to Patrick McGrail after that. Dr. Brusch pul led out a letter McGrail had written to him just a few months earlier, on May 11, 1987: \"I am still being treated by Dr. Brusch for my cancer of 11 years and am doing good. When I was operated on, they said I would not live two years. The Essiac worked wonders.\" I asked Dr. Brusch for his own personal comments about the McGrail case. He said simply: \"It was the Essiac that does the trick. That's one case.\" The second case was much more recent-and even more dramatic. This one involved a man named Ross Nimchick. Along with Nimc hick's case file-which contained all the supporting medical records-Dr. Brusch had a written account from Nimchick detailing every step of the way in his own words: \"June 15, 1986. I, Ross Nimchick, came dow n with a cold and loss of voice. My glands were swollen and I noticed a lump near my left collarbone and in the groin area. \"June 23 rd : Appointment with Dr. Clinton. He examined the lump and gave me a prescription and had me go for blood tests. \"June 25 th : Blood tests taken at Holyoke Hospital. \"July 7 th : Dr. Clinton recommends a biopsy \"July 2lst: Biopsy completed at Holyoke Hospital. \"July 30 th : I called Dr. Clinton's office for the bi opsy report.

I look forward to talking to you soon after my next report. Sincerely, Ross Nimchick.\" With cases like that in his files after almost 30 years of personal experience with Essiac, Dr. Brusch is frustrated and unhappy at the lack of attention it has received from medical authorities. But he has no plans to give up his public praise of Essiac. Why? Because he's convinced that Essiac ha s too much value to humanity to allow it to disappear. \"I don't say it cures everythi ng,\" Dr. Brusch told me. \"But it's the only thing I know so far that can do the work as well as this. That's why I feel so good about this stuff. I know: The stuff works!\" The day after my meeting with Dr. Brusch, I left to visit Bracebridge again. Mary wanted to introduce me to some of the people in town who had known Rene and had their own personal experiences with Essiac. I'll always be grateful for what those good and generous people in Bracebridge shared with me on that trip. CHAPTER TWELVE In the transcript of the 1939 Royal Cancer Commission hearings is the testimony of a woman named Eliza Veitch. Sworn to oath almost 50 years ago, she told her own story under interrogation by doctors and lawyers. She'd been operated on in 1935 for cancer of the bladder. \"So then I went home and months went on and I began to get wors e, gradually going down and getting off my feet. I could not stand on my feet. That wa s where my pain was. When I would stand I would have this terrible pain.\" She went for an examination. The doctor told her that one spot had started to grow again. \"So I didn't know what to do. I didn' t think there was any use going back. I had my mind made up. I was going to die with it. Ther e is no use going back and being tortured again.\" She got worse. She lost weight. She coul dn't sleep. When she'd finally given up all hope, she went to Nurse Caisse. That was in May, 1938. \"I began to see the neighbors around. My next neighbor was gett ing cured, and one here and one over there, and I talked to them . People came to see me and told me and this one and that one told me and I thought, `Well, there is something in it. I'll go in: I didn't have"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 82 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 faith at first.\" For eight treatments she didn't notice any change. Then she had a bad reaction. \"I thought I was done for sure then but that was the turning point. Then I began to improve and I improved fast.\" When she testified, Eliza Veitch said sh e was at her normal weight of 143 pounds. \"I am not saying I am cured yet, but I can te ll you in percentage that I am 75% better today. I have cabins on Three Mile Lake, and I look after my cabins and my guests, and last year, I could not hardly walk to the place.\" She finished: \"I owe my life to Miss Ca isse. I would have been dead and in my grave months ago.\" Months before my trip to Bracebridge in October, 1987, I had read the hundreds of pages of transcript from those hearings . I'd read Eliza Veitch's testimony and been moved by it. But most of the names of Rene 's witnesses had long since faded to the back of my mind. They were voices from the past, people who were all probably dead now, their stories-except for the passag es in this obscure transcript-buried with them. On my second day in town, I went to th e Bracebridge City Hall to ask for an interview with the municipal clerk, a man, Ma ry told me, who dabbled in the history of Bracebridge and knew something about Rene's story. Mary believed he had accumulated some of the documents from Rene's era. When she mentioned him, I thought I heard his name as Ken Beech. The best I was hoping for was that he might be willing to share his documents and tell me a little bit about what he knew Bu t knowing the skepticism-even nervousness and paranoia-of the locals who were familia r with Rene Caisse, and guessing that a public official would dodge controversy about her, especially with a stranger who just showed up at his office without an introduction, I was ready to be turned away. The Bracebridge City Hall is a large, two-story building just down the street from Rene's old clinic. Inside, it is clean and well cared for, with a large open area where a dozen or so men and women keep the ta x roles and manage the business of the city. I waited in a short line until it was my turn. The woman behind the counter seemed surprised to hear that I was from Los A ngeles, had no appointment, and wanted to speak to Ken about someone named Rene Ca isse. But she said just a moment and walked to the rear of the building and went into an office with a closed door. A few moments later, she came out and as ked if 2:00-right after lunch-would be okay I think I was as surprised as she was by the answer, and I told her I'd see her then. When I returned at 2:00, Ken came out imme diately to greet me. He looked to be in his 40s, a nice-looking man wearing a well-ta ilored suit, someone who appeared as though he would be just as co mfortable doing the same job in a much larger city. I was impressed and glad that he seemed happy to see me. But I was surprised. His reaction didn't fit my image of how a city of ficial woul d react to an outsider asking about Rene Caisse. He escorted me into the office and we sat down at a large conference table that sat in front of a desk."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 83 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 Ken showed none of the reserve I expected to encounter. All I had to say was that I was writing a book about Rene Caisse and that I believed in her work, and he was all smiles and enthusiasm. He opened up instan tly. He said he d already been to his home at lunch and brought back some of th e old documents-newspaper stories, the town ordinance granting her use of the hot el for her clinic, and so on-and he was passionate, he said, that the truth be known about Rene Caisse. \"She treated a lot of people,\" he said. \"I can't tell you who was cured or who wasn't cured, but my family had faith in it. I don't know what she had, but she had something that made people feel better. She had something that saved a lot of suffering. There are people using it today.\" Ken told me one recent story around town that he'd seen with his own eyes. \"A fellow I know had cancer and was on his de athbed, and I know this because I saw him. He was skin and bones and had termin al cancer and he was on his way out. He started taking Essiac and, I kid you not, I saw him a few weeks later and he was driving his car. Now, he still died. He was just too far gone. But when I saw him driving his car, he didn't look bad. He looke d sort of full in the face. I couldn't believe it. I just couldn't believe it. But he felt all right. I heard that from his daughter. She told me he really felt good.\" Growing up in Bracebridge, Ken said, he heard the stories about Rene Caisse. He wasn't paying much attention at the time . But what he heard did convince him that Rene Caisse's treatment was for real. \"She had something,\" he said. \"There are people of high witness for that. It eased their suffering, and by God, what the hell's wrong with that? If you meet my uncle, he'll tell you all that, where he saw people come into her clinic in desperate shape, ja ws exposed, just awful stuff, hideous stuff. A few months later, they'd walk away happy and healthy. I could go on for hours.\" The whole history, he admitted, had left him with \"a hatred for a system that causes this. But I don't know what to do about it. It's pretty hopeless. It boggles my mind.\" After we'd been talking about a half hour, I happened to mention the 1939 Cancer Commission hearings. \"I think I've read th em,\" Ken said. \"I can't say I read every word of them, but I know that it all took place. My grandmother was one of themEliza Veitch. She had cancer of the uterus. She was 89 when she died in 1966 or 1967.\" Chills went up my spine. Suddenly I unde rstood why this city official was so friendly to a stranger asking questions a bout Rene Caisse. He was the grandson of the woman whose words I had read and be en moved by. I felt a personal connection to Eliza Veitch that I hadn't felt before. I told Ken that I'd read his grandmother's testimony and hadn't expected to meet someone in her family. \"My dad and my uncle can really tell you the first-hand account of the whole thing,\" he said. \"I tell you, I'd love for you to meet them. You can put into words what they can only in their own modest way try to tell you. They're not particularly educated people, but their sincerity will blow you away.\" What did Ken personally remember about what his grandmother said about Rene Caisse? \"Well, Rene was like a hero worship to my grandmother, because she knew she was"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 84 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 cured. A few of the little things she told me , I can still recall. In every case, she said that after taking it for a certain period of tim e, there was a sickne ss, a sort of a weak spell, and my grandmother told me she co llapsed out in one of our parks here. My father or my uncle was with her, and they took her right straight back to the clinic. It was after one of her treatments, and Rene Caisse said to her that it was a good sign. That was an indication that something wa s working, that the treatment was taking effect, and from that time on she started to revive. What else did his grandmother tell him about Rene? \"Well, there was frustration, a little bit of distrust of the doctors because they fought her so hard. One of the doctors that opposed her so vociferously in those years in the 30s died himself of cancer, and the story goes-I wasrit there to hear it, but my grandmother told me-that he pleaded with Rene to treat him for cancer and she wouldn't do it.\" He laughed. \"I don't know whether it's true of not. That's the story. But Rene was always very kind, very nice. She had vis itors galore. People traveled from all over the country to plead with he r to treat their husband or wife. I guess a lot of the cancer treatment is the hope that peopl e feel when they get on the cure. Psychologically, I think that's a factor. Bu t there's no doubt in my mind either that these herbs somehow purify the blood. So if it' s not a cure for cancer, then why isn't it a tonic, an herbal tonic, available for $ 1.00 to everyone in the country? \"I think maybe one of the problems was that it was called a drug. I don't think it's a drug. It's a tonic. You buy vitamins ever y day in the health food stores and drugstores all across the world. What's wrong with it being used as a tonic? Perhaps that's the approach. \"It's confusing, to say the least, how these things happen. I don't know what the process is where people can get some things on the shelves-here, take this. It's a puzzle. But an herbal recipe, how wrong can it be? What harm can it cause? Why should an association that wants it proven firs t that it's a cure hold back that kind of relief from people who are dying every year of cancer? What's wrong with making them feel better? I don't understand that. \"My grandmother told me, and I believe this , that Rene Caisse would never have had any problem saving people's lives, saving thei r suffering, if the local doctors had left her alone. And I have to believe that. My grandmother was a god-fearing woman. The doctors harassed Rene about her busin ess and it was they who took her to task as she was treating people and she wasn't a doctor. God forbid. I expect Rene was taking some of their customers away. If they'd kept their mouths shut...it was awful.\" By now, we'd been talking for almost an hour. I was concerned that I might be taking too much time out of Ken's af ternoon schedule. When I suggested that perhaps I should let him go, he sai d, no way. Anybody who came all the way to Bracebridge from Los Angeles to learn about Rene Caisse was welcome to as much of his time as was needed. He said he had a videotape of a Canadian television show he wanted me to see-the one that aired after the Homemaker's artic le appeared-and he wanted rne to meet Mayor Lang. \"The mayor, he knew Rene, and he believes, too, that she had something. He knows it helped ease people's suffering and made them feel good, and he'll tell you his own story be cause he was a personal friend of Rene's, even though"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 85 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 he's my age.\" Ken took me upstairs to a conference room with a television and went to get the tape. A few minutes after he returned, the mayor walked in. Jim Lang is a tall, lanky man with the hearty look of an outdoorsman. He was dressed casually and wearing cowboy boots. He gave me a friendly greeting, said he was happy that someone was looking into the story of Rene Caisse, and got to the point as quickly as Ken had: \"A fellow who used to be a neighbor of mine, he died a couple of years ago, I guess he was 77 y ears old. But his mother used to run a boarding house here in town. He didn't marr y until his 50s, so he was living at home at the time Rene had her clinic going. He used to tell me of dozens and dozens of people who came and stayed at his mo ther's boarding house while they took treatments. They were from all over the place, from Timmons and Sault. Ste. Marie and down in the states -just all over the place-and they'd stay there maybe two, three, four months, depending on the length of treatments required. \"He used to tell me of so me of them. When they firs t came in there, you'd wonder how they could even get around, they were in such terrible shape with either tumors exposed on their face or because they were so thin and weak, and he said that when they left his mother's place they were cured, they were just like new persons, you wouldn't recognize them as the same people, when they came and when they left.\" The mayor had organized Rene's 90 th birthday party, a few months before she died. More than 600 people were there, from a ll over Canada-and some from the U.S. \"A lot of people,\" the mayor sa id, \"just voluntarily wanted to say something because they had been treated by her for cancer. That sort of thing went on for hours. If you'd been here and heard some of the tributes that were paid by her former patients, it would bring tears to your eyes. \"You know, I often wonder if the treatments that have been performed by research doctors when they test the stuff were done in the same manner that Rene did it. That's the other thing nobody knows, becaus e she certainly had results. She cured people that were given up on by doctors-t otally given up on. They said, `You're going to die and there's nothing we can do a bout it: And they went to Rene and 20 years later they were still walking. I know that for a fact because I knew Rene for probably 25 years.\" As a young man, Jim Lang had helped Rene out doing odd jobs around her house. \"I can remember working in her home in the 50s and 60s. I used to look after all of Rene's stuff. And people were coming into her home for treatment then. Her patient load was down because she had to be car eful about what she did, but there were people that she knew and for some reason, she looked after them. They'd come to her house.\" I mentioned that the worst thing I'd ev er heard about Rene was that she was stubborn. The mayor laughed. \"I wouldn't have cast her as being stubborn. She was certainly set in her ways, but I would sa y more determined than stubborn. She was very determined. If you were having a discussion with Rene, you'd certainly know that you were in an argument before you were finished, and most times you'd probably be convinced that she was right . No, I wouldn't say she was stubborn. She was a very kindly person, very compassi onate and very dedicated. She really believed in what she was doing, really belie ved it. I think if the truth were known, there are probably a good number of treatments that she never got paid for.\""},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 86 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 After a few more minutes, the mayor said he had to leave. He offered any help he could give, and said: \"The stupid part is th at we've got nothing to lose (by giving it a try) and everything to gain. But how do we get the right people to listen? It's a shame, you know, every year that goes by, Rene 's story is getting buried deeper and deeper. Pretty soon there wori t be any of these old people left to tell it.\" Ken said that he was going to make certain that I had the opportunity to hear it from his uncle Elmer, Eliza Veitch's son. Ken wa nted to make sure that I heard about Essiac from three generations of the same family. \"My uncle had personal experience going to Rene Caisse's clinic for months while he took my grandmother in for treatment. To hear his story with the sights he saw and the people he saw come at one stage and leave walking a nd happy months later is just absolutely phenomenal. He's not going to kid you. Thes e aren't people who are going to lie to you. They're going to tell you the truth. My uncle has a very good memory. He's a great memorizer of poems and stuff like that.\" The next day at 10 a.m., I pulled up to park on the street not far from the city hall, and just as I was turning off my engine , I saw an old man struggling up the front steps. He was carrying a cane and he wa s having difficulty making the short climb to the front door. One leg was completely bowe d, as if from severe arthritis. He was slightly hunched over. He was wearing old work clothes. I learned later that he is 75 years old. A nice-looking, gray-haired woman, dressed up as if on her way to church, had him by one arm and was helping him. I thought: I' ll bet that's Ken's uncle Elmer and his aunt Edra, and I was touched that so meone who knew Rene so many years ago would take the time and trouble to come to to wn and climb those stairs to talk to a stranger about her. I waited until they were through the front door and had enough time to get settled, and then I entered the building. The lady at the front desk told me to go right on in. Once in the office, it turned out I was right. The old man struggling up the stairs was Ken's Uncle Elmer. But up close and comfortably seated, Elme r appeared differently, not a vulnerable, crippled-up old man at all. He had thic k, muscular arms and strong hands and a powerful grip. As he greeted me with a bi g smile, I felt the warmth of his personality His eyes sparkled, and he was handsome in the craggy way of those old ranchers and woodsmen. He was totally alert, with a quick wit and a booming voice and a loud and hearty laugh that came from deep within. His wife Edra was a formidable presen ce in her own right, obviously a woman of radiant good health. The thought actually cr ossed my mind that even though she was in her late 60s, she looked like one of thos e people who'd never had a sick day in her life. After a few minutes of getting to know each other, I turned on my tape recorder and asked Elmer to tell me a bout his mother, Eliza Veitch, and Rene Caisse. In that strong, deep voice, and every once in a while pounding the table for emphasis, Elmer spoke without interruptions or quest ions for several minutes. Like everyone I met in northern Canada, he has the endear ing habit of occasionally punctuating his sentences with an \"eh?\" Pronounced like a long \"A\" with a question mark. Before I got out of town, I heard myself starting to do it, too. It's catchy. What follows in the"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 87 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 next few pages is a verbatim transcript of Elmer's impassioned opening account. This man can speak for himself: Elmer Veitch: This is getting on 50 years ago, and my mother had been diagnosed as having cancer. So she got wise to Miss Caisse's clinic here. Of course, it was going all over in those days, it was quite famous. So ever y week that was Miss Caisse's wish-that you come every week for treatments. At that time, she administered the treatment by hypodermic needle. As a result, I took my mother down and we started these treatments every week. I had an old Model A Ford and I was a young fellow in those days. But I'll never regret it-and I'll never forget it either, because some of the sights I saw over here on this corner. . . horrible. The people were from all over North America. A lot of people from your country came over here. My mother had the statement saying she ha d cancer, otherwise they wouldn't allow Miss Caisse to treat her. So every w eek I brought her down and Miss Caisse told her, \"Now sooner or later, and probabl y sooner, you'll have a reaction with this stuff.\" It didn't happen for a couple of weeks, but then it happened right here in the clinic. She sort of went into a kind of a feve r and chills, you know, but it didn't last long, not long enough to worry too much about. I took her home. She was all right. So these treatments went on for, well, as I remember, must have been six months, I guess. She kept taking these treatments and feeling better all the time. So at the end of about six months, Miss Caisse t hought she'd had enough, which was probably right. Now mother lived to be 83. That's 30 year s after this happened, eh? Mother lived to be 83 and died a natural death, as natural as anybody would, and the cancer evidently was blocked tight-it never got nowhere. But yours truly was coming down here every we ek to this clinic. You'd have to wait a couple of hours to get your turn. It was a big building and the bottom floor was all taken out and seats put all around the big room, and every time I'd come in there, it was on a Saturday, they'd be all sitti ng around there. Heavens, you thought they'd been there all week. So having nothing better to do, I went ar ound and I talked to these people. They were very nice people and some of them had half a face, you could see their teeth. Some of them, you could see their ribs. Si ghts like this haunted me for a long time, you know, and I talked to these people. They talked to me, a good many of them. The pain they went through was something awful. They'd suf fered, and I could see that, you know, but they said since we've b een taking Miss Caisse s treatment, thank her and the Lord, we've got no pain. No pain after suffering for months with desperate pains. She stopped the pain. Now, I don't know, I don't know Mind you, she couldn't put back flesh that was gone off your ribs or jaws that are gone off your face, and so me of them-oh, God, it was horrible, I'll tell you. I can still remember this . It used to haunt me for quite a while."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 88 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 But that impressed me very much when th ey told me what they were suffering, and now they had no pain. \"Oh, Miss Caisse is an angel,\" they'd say. I guess she seemed like that to them. I don't know about a lot of the terminal cases, they probably...but a lot of them got better. Now I couldn't tell you their names. Never did know their names. But I talked to them every week and invariably they al l told me the same story: We have no more pain. And they were quite emphatic about that. You can well understand it, too. My mother, oh, she was a great friend of Miss Caisse. Now about this time there was a neighbor of ours just across the lake from us. His name was Wilson Hammell. He was one of the old-timers in this country here, one of the old pioneers, if you will, and then up towards Bracebridge a little further was another fellow, Burt Rossen. He was born and raised in Muskoka, so I knew these guys all my life, both of them, eh? They both had trouble and they went to To ronto, to the big hospitals, and they both had cancer of the rectum. They stayed dow n there for a while and the powers that be told them that they might as well go home. Same thing happened to both of them. They're only going to live a month-you can't possibly live more than a month. Now those guys were up in years, th ey were grown, maybe 50 years old or thereabouts. The doctors sent them hom e, go to your homes, boys, you're only going to live a month, it's impossible for you to live any longer because of what you have, eh? I remember all this quite vividly. They each came home with the f act that they could only live a month. So, you know, a drowning man will grasp at a straw, and then Miss Caisse was treating `em, boy. They just went for her like that, eh? They started out with these needles in the arm, eh? With the Essiac. I can't remember how long they took the treatment, but it was for quite a length of time, maybe six months, eh? Or thereabouts. I'll tell you what happened. Now this wa s common knowledge all over. They passed that big black cancer that was in the rect um, both of them, it came away, and those men lived for 35 years after that, both of th em, and died a natural death as old men. Now I'll lay this on a stack of Bibles, a nd I'm not given to lying, I hate anybody that does, but that is actually what happened. Now, well, everybody around here was completely sold on this deal, eh? So she tried to get the medical profession to recognize he r, and I'll have to tell you there was a couple of doctors in this town, they're dead and gone long ago, but they would a killed her if they could of. They said sh e's only a quack, and the one fella said, I wouldn't take that stuff, I'd die first-and die he did, with cancer. Now this was the general feeling of the medical profession all over the country I don't know why. I can't imagine why a nybody that could help anybody, God, I don't know why it knocked em, eh? There was people from your country, all over the states. They came to this clinic, and I'll tell you, I witnessed quite a few of them. They were there every day. I only came on Sa turdays, but when they told me about their suffering and the fact that after the treatment started their pain vanished-could you blame them for standing up on their hind legs and screaming about it? I didn't."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L.

She died an old lady in the hospital here in Bracebridge. That was the end of Elmer's uninterrupted story. When he was imished with what he had to say, I asked him if hi s mother had gone for surgery or other treatment besides Essiac. \"No,\" he said. \"She wouldn't go for the surgery.\" Then the conversation wandered for a few mi nutes. Edra hadn't said a word since I'd turned on the tape recorder. Finally, out of nowhere, she said: \"I had cancer, too.\" \"You did?\" I blurted out. I'm sure the surprise showed on my face. \"Three years ago,\" she said. And Edra, the pi cture of health, told her own story. She had gone into the hospital in Perry Sound for a simple hysterectomy. But they found a malignant growth on her left ovary. \"T hey took the uterus, they took everything, and they sent it away and found that it wa s fairly aggressive—that was the term they used. They said I'd have to have further treatment. I said, what does this entail? The surgeon said radiation, and I said, oh, Lor d. I felt as if my whole world had fallen apart. \"When he said radiation, I thought, well, Lo rd, this is the end, or the beginning of the end, and I think I'd better come to te rms with it. I had so much experience with the rest of my family, on my mother's si de. She had seven sisters and five of them died of cancer. \"I nursed my aunt, my mother's younger si ster, for a year. She had cancer of the bone. Her arms broke off here, her legs broke off between her hips. She was just like a rag doll, and there was not hing left of her but a hank of hair and these broken bones. She didn't weigh 35 pounds when she died, and she was only 32 years old. \"It started out a little, wee growth in her left breast no bigger than a peanut, but it was on the breast bone, and she had suf fered w ith a lame hip. She ha d a little girl who was less than two years old, and after she had that little girl she could hardly walk, you know, for a long, long time, and then she noticed this little lump in her breast, so she went and they did a total mastectomy, ju st cleaned her right out down to the rib cage, you know \"It was dreadful, and a ll the nodes under her arm and everything, and then it came back in her hip, that's wh ere it came first, and her ribs let go from her spine-they were crosse d over each other. You never saw such a pathetic and heartbreaking sight in your life, and I will never forget her. \"In those days, they had nothing to treat he r. She came to Miss Caisse, but she was so ill she couldn't stand the car ride. So she had to give it up. She was too far gone. Had they got her when they found this little lump, if Miss Caisse had got her then, she would maybe still be living today.\" \"It was a horrible death. I witnessed it,\" Elmer said. \"And my mother had cancer-both her ova ries. She had a four pound tumor on one and five or six pounds on the other, and she swelled up like a woman in the last stages of pregnancy That was in 1948. But at that time, Nurse Caisse's treatment wasn't available.\" \"You couldn't get it,\" Elmer said. \"N o way. They banned the whole works.\" \"We couldn't get it for mother,\" Edra said. \"It was no longer available.\""},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L.

I asked Edra how she felt about that in 1948. \"Oh, I was very bitter about that. I was very angry with the doctors in this town, in particular, for blackballing her the way they did. They really did blackball her. I am not so familiar with it as my husband and my mother-in-law, but my mother-in-law was the closest thing to a saint.\" Elmer perked up. \"That's why I'm so good!\" We all laughed. I asked Edra how she had felt after her radiation treatments. \"Oh, sick!,\" she said. \"Nauseous, diarrhea, shaky. I would sit and my stomach would go like that-you could see it jumping. It di dn't just quiver inside. You could see it jumping with the nerves, you know Oh, burn, oh! They don't prepare you, you know, for what that radiation is like. \"I had one every morning at 9:30. Well, I was so sick I could hardly get to the hospital. That's the dread I had. After a bout 17 or 18 treatments, I couldn't even go to the dining room because of the smell of food. I was like someone in the first stages of pregnancy. I couldn't stand the smell of the dining room.\" I asked her what kept her going. \"Well, I knew I had 30 treatments to go a nd I just thought, well, that's one less. Tomorrow I'll have another one and that w ill be one less, and I took it one day at a time. It was the only hope I ha d at that point. The last th ree weeks, I was just too ill to drive the 125 miles to get home and back. I was too ill to even come home. \"In the meantime, he's got this in motion to get me the Essiac. This is what I was looking forward to. I thought if I could ju st get that, I'm going to get better.\" I asked Elmer how he went about getting th e Essiac. He explained about getting a doctor to provide a certificate, then ge tting it cleared through somebody's office in Ottowa, then getting the Resperin Co rporation to send the Essiac. A lot of paperwork and red tape, was what it was. \"Then the Resperin Corporation sends it to you, eh?\" he said. \"For about six months they never charged us a cent. Miss Caisse left a legacy for people, and how much funding I don't know, but we got it for six m onths and it never cost a penny. Now we pay what for three or four bottles-$40? That's $ 10 a bottle. You can't measure money against Essiac.\" But the first step in the process was written documentation that Edra did have cancer. \"I can't really say what kind it was,\" she said. Some medical term she doesn't recall. \"But it was carcinoma.\" Weeks had gone by after Elmer wrote the h ealth officials in Ottowa asking for approval to get the Essiac. Nothing happe ned. So he contacted their member of parliament. \"Boy, Elmer rattled their chai n,\" Edra laughed. \"I'll tell you, he went right after them.\" And, she says, the MP's secretary went after Dr. Sproul, the Minister of Health, and before long, they received their Essiac."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 91 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 Edra had been home from the hospital for about a month. She was totally beaten. \"I would lay awake all night, my nerves were so bad,\" she said. \"It was just like this.\" She shook her hands, imitating someone who' s intensely jittery. \"I couldn't sleep. You know, oh, it was dreadful, and then I'd get up and cry at the least little thing. My nerves were just-I was just shot. I hadn't taken the Essiac 10 days until I started to pick up.\" She was emphatic about it. \"I was so so re from the radiation, you know, my bowels, my bladder, everything. I wa s so badly burned from the radiation. But I hadn't taken Essiac 10 days when I got up one mo rning and I said, `Gosh, I'm hungry for breakfast: Elmer looked at me, you know, be cause I hadn't said I was hungry for a long time. But I was really hungry for breakfas t. I started to eat again and lose the nausea and the diarrhea and my genera l well-being-my outlook on life-seemed to improve. I seemed to feel better every day. I've never missed a meal since. I've never had a sick stomach. Mind you, my nerves we re hot. I guess-poor father here-I was pretty hard to live with for a while.\" She looked over at Elmer and laughed. \"That' s when I took to drink,\" Elmer said. \"I'll tell you,\" Edra said, \"I've been taki ng it for two and a ha lf years now, and quite truthfully I don't think I'd be here today if it weren't for Essiac. I feel sure. I think this Essiac is my insurance. That's the wa y I look at it. It's my insurance. I do all my own work. I help Dad whenever I can.\" \"Dad don't do a hell of a lot, either,\" Elmer laughed. \"And I'm involved with my church work a lot,\" Edra went on. \"I keep busy. For an old lady of 67, I think I'm doing pretty good. I think I'm very, very lucky, you know My own doctor has taken blood test a nd blood test, bone marrow, liver, chest X-rays, bladder sample, you name it, he's taken it, blood sugar-everything is A-1. So praise God, I have a lot to be thankful for. \"I think it was about the 6 th of September when I had a checkup. The doctor says, `You know, you're incredible: I said, `No, I'm not. You know what's doing it, don't you?' He says, `Edra, I really believe it. I'm really beginning to have faith in this medication. You just keep it up: He's beginning to see that it has done me some good. You see, they're skeptical. They have to be. Whenever there's something new, you're skeptical until it's proven. Areri t you? Well, he sees me on a regular basis and he's beginning to believe that this is really working for me. The last time I was down there, they couldn't find anything. I feel fine.\" At this point Edra was finished telling her own story. So I asked Elmer to tell me more about the years of Rene's clinic. What was the mood in the clinic? \"Well, it was subdued, to say the least. Bu t these people knew they were going to get help. Having nothing to do and being a little snoopy, I went around and talked to some of the bad cases, and by God, I'm telling you, there was some god-awful looking sights, to put it mildl y, and those people told me that they'd suffered the tortures of hell, for years some of them , eh? That's almost the identical words to what they told me. \"But since they'd been coming here, oh, were they pleased. `We have no pain anymore, no pain,' they'd say. In big cap ital letters!

They were so powerful that Miss Caisse was on the verge of being arrested, eh?\" \"Heavens, she was an angel of mercy,\" Edra said. \"People reacted when they closed her down,\" Elmer sai d. \"But they were more or less powerless. They couldn't battle the power s that be that were against her. It was like beating your head against the wall. But everybody was pretty mad at the time. Those people that were afflicted, they were pretty damn badly provoked to think that nobody else was going to get help, eh?\" We talked for a few minutes about the ol d days in Bracebridge and some of the people Elmer had known who were helped by Rene's injections. Then I asked Edra how she takes the Essiac today. \"I take one ounce in two ounces of hot wa ter each night, preferably on an empty stomach. Take it on an empty stomach and it goes through all the organs, you know By itself. It's not mixed in with anything else and you get the full benefit of it. I don't mind taking it. I've rather acquired a taste for it. At first it was kind of, yech. But I hadn't taken it long before I got to like the herbal taste. It's all herbs, that's all it is.\" \"The Indians knew all the herbs and the value of them,\" Elmer said. \"Today we know nothing about most of them.\" \"I'd like to see this made available to ev eryone that needs it \", Edra said. \"For the medical profession to accept it and dispense it to thei r patients. If they have the authority to ban it, then they also have the authority to oka y it and put it on the market. If they want to charge people $10 a bottle for it-if they've got to make money out of it, fine-but for God's sake give it to people and give them a chance at life! It's not synthetic. It's pure stuff.\" \"Those Indians, they knew something,\" Elmer said. \"I'll tell you, those herbs can help you. You know if you take the burdoc k root and black cherry bark, it'll straighten up any skin eruption. It's so damn powerful. You wouldn't believe it.\" I'd never heard of that, so I asked Elmer to tell me about it. \"Just peel the black cherry bark off and boil it up and grind up the burdock roots and drink it,\" he said. \"It's sure bitter,\" Edra said. \"Well, they're basic elements in a lot of medicines, pate nt medicines today. It's used in cough medicines to a great extent. But you combine the two-burdock and black cherry bark-and it's the greatest thing th ere is for any skin eruption. Poison ivy.

All th e doctor could do was prescribe pain pills. \"Well, that poor child couldn't sleep for the pain. So Elmer said, `Well, I'll get something fixed up for her before you come home. I'll get some black cherry bark and some burdock: Sure enough, she took it fo r two or three days and the pain was gone and her leg was clearing up.\" \"Don't doubt it, for Christ sake,\" Elmer said. \"Because it's authentic.\" I asked Elmer how he brewed up his homemad e herbal shingles cure. \"It's very, very simple,\" he said. \"You peel the bark off the black cherry tree, preferably the young trees with the softer and more aromatic bar k. Some of those trees get so big that the bark is hard and tough, something like an old man, like myself. So you get the younger trees. Peel the limbs and you end up with a bunch of shavings. The inner part is green, very green. Get about five or six handfuls. \"The burdock blood roots you can get at any h ealth food store. They're cheap as hell, eh? And you put about a handful in the pot a nd boil it all. Don't hesitate to boil it plenty. It just looks like a very strong tea when it's made, but you taste it, it's great. But you've got to boil it good to get the esse nce out of the bark, and then like she says, drink a wine glass every day \" \"You have to strain it well,\" Edra said. At this point Mayor Lang came in to sa y hello to everyone. Elmer was calling him \"young fella,\" and teasing him about this and that, and af ter a while as everyone was starting to leave, I thanked Elmer and Edra for coming to town to talk to me. \"What we've told you is to the best of our ability,\" Elmer said. \"And it's all true. There's no fabrication-none whatsoever. I've witnessed these people that were cured, and I'll tell you, it means something when you witness it yourself. There's one sure way of selling anything. As they say, the proof of the pudding is eating the damn stuff.\" CHAPTER THIRTEEN The day after my meeting with Elmer and Edra Veitch, Mary took me to visit her friends, Ted and Iona Hale. Ordinarily they don't talk to people they don't know well about their experience with Essiac. I learne d later that they haven't even told the oncologist who treated Iona Hale. But w ith Mary providing the entree, they had agreed to tell me their story. On a crisp autumn afternoon, Mary and I left Bracebridge and drove about 20 minutes into the country, through the beau tiful Canadian plain country and past small farms. Just outside a village even smaller than Bracebridge, we turned onto a quiet street and parked in front of Ted and Iona's home, next to their big RV. The Hales came out to greet us. Ted's a mu scular man in his 60s, a retired truck driver, with a square jaw and a thinning wh ite head of hair. He s from a clan of pioneer types, one of those guys who's sp ent his life proudly he lping to build the communities of the Canadian northwoods. Wh en we visited, he was recovering from a stroke."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 94 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 Iona had worked hard taking care of him as he'd gradually gotten better and back on his feet again. She's a trim, nice-looki ng woman in her 60s, but she looks younger than her years. We went into their living room, a large, co mfortable room with a spectacular view of the countryside. Ted sat in his lounge chair, Iona sat across the room from him, then she nodded to Ted and asked him to just go ahead and tell the story, his own way, in his own words. Ted had known about Rene Caisse and Essiac ever since he was a young man. He was working with a crew building a highway, for wages of $1.00 a day, and boarding at his sister's. \"There was this Mrs. Graham, she used to like you to come in and play cards,\" Ted said. \"She was sic k. Dr. Bastedo of Bracebridge said that she had cancer, and if she didn't have an opera tion right away, she'd die within a couple of months time. She could only be up about an hour a day and she spent most of that hour laying on a couch.\" Ted and a friend of his named Tom told her that she should go down and try Nurse Caisse. They talked to her for quite a while trying to convince her, \"Finally, she said, `Well, I can't drive a car. I can't go down th ere: \"Tom said, `You don't need to drive a car. We'II drive you down, and we'11 help you in and back to the car and bring you home again and help you into the house: And she said, All right, I'll try it: \"So we took her down. Her first treatment was around the first of March. We were finishing up the job on the road there about the end of March, and I saw her car go driving down the road. When she went inside again, I ran in and said, `You know we're going to Bracebridge tonight, right af ter supper.' And she said, `You boys don't have to take me down. I can drive myse lf down.' So she did. She drove herself down, got her treatments by her self. And that fall, she was out playing ball with the rest of us. She was out running around the bases and everything.\" Mary smiled in recognition at the story. \"I think her name was Elsie Graham,\" she said. I asked Ted how long Elsie Graham lived. \"Oh, for years after,\" he said. \"She lived a long time after that,\" Mary said. \"I don't know how long, but a long time.\" (A few months after this conversa tion, I was rummaging through Rene's files and came across a letter written in 1938 by Elsie Graham. \"It gives me the greatest of pleasure to write this testimonial in fa vor of Miss Rene Caisse \", she began. Then she said that four doctors had told her sh e had cancer of the cervix. \"I had to keep lying down most of the time & could not work. I could hardly sit in a car to go and get treatments,\" she wrote. But after four or five treatments by Rene, \"I was able to drive my own car.\" She added: \"I feel just fine. I haven't any pain, and as far as I know, I am cured. I have talked with hundr eds of her patients at the clinic in Bracebridge who all claim to be helped by her treatments, many claiming to be cured. I feel sure Miss Caisse has got a cu re for cancer. \") Ted knew of others from those days when Rene had her clinic, he said, and he mentioned some names: John McNee, Wilson Hammell, Jack Clinton. But then many years later, in 1977, Iona was diagnosed at Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto as having cancer of the bowel. The doctors told Ted that Iona was going to die-and soon. \"The specialist at Princess Margaret explained to me how sick my wife was. I told him, `You don't have to explain to me how sick my wife is."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 95 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 I know how sick she is.' He said, `She can 't live only a couple of days. You realize she's not eating anything.' And I said, `Yes, I know that: He said, `She's just starving to death. She's got nothing left. She can't ea t because she's full of cancer from the bottom of her stomach to the top.' \"So I sa id, `Well, I'd like to know something. I've heard they're trying out this Essiac on a hundred patients here in Toronto, to test and see how well it works. This is the most likely place to have a hundred patients with cancer, so are they testing it in this hospital?' \"He said, `What do you mean?' \"I said, `Ess iac. Nurse Caisse in Bracebridge, she got this treatment from some lady up north. I'd just like to know where they're testing that:\" He said, `What do you call that?' \"I said, `Essiac. Miss Caisse's treatment for cancer, in Bracebridge: \"Oh, his face just went livid red. I never seen anybody tu rn red so quick. He started down the hall swearing something awful. He said, `That damned Essiac, that damned laetrile in Mexico, it's nothing but a fraud, there' s nothing to it. It's nothing but quack medicine. She's just another one of thos e quacks: \"I said, `What do you do for cancer patients here in this place?' \"He said, `If you're so damned smart, you tell me.' \"I said, All you're doing here is keeping cancer in suspension: And he left and I never saw him again. They gave Iona five radiat ion treatments and se nt her home to die. They said that was all they could do fo r her. They couldn't do anything for her.\" \"They just gave me the radium treatments, \" Iona said, \"hoping it would take the pain out of this cancerous stone I had.\" I asked them what happened next. \"Well, I came home. You tell him,\" Iona said to Ted. Ted said that the ambulance brought Iona hom e and two or three days later his sister called with the phone number of a doctor in Bracebridge who could help them get in touch with Rene Caisse. So Ted made an a ppointment to see the doctor. \"I told him what she was like and how she'd had an ope ration and had a tumor taken out of her stomach, that they'd found she had a type of cancer that would scatter fast, that she wouldn't live long at all. \"After sitting there nearly an hour talking, why he pushed himself back in the chair and said, `There s no use of you getting Essi ac for your wife. It won't help her.' He said, `I know a girl in north Bracebridge who just died of cancer. Essiac didn't help her one bit: \"I said, `Listen, I don't want your advice. I just want to know where I can find Miss Caisse. You kept me sitting here for nearly an hour telling you all about my wife, and then you tell me it won't work. I didn't ask you if it would work. I asked you where Miss Caisse is living. I wa nt to see her: \"He said, `Well, I don't believe in it, but I'll take you to anothe r doctor here who does believe. Come on with me:\" So they went down the hall and Ted was in troduced to another doctor. He told Ted that he couldn't put Iona on Essiac until after hed given her a thorough examination. Those were Miss Caisse's orders. And she ha d to have a written description of Iona s illness-type of cancer, what the surgery was, everything that had been done. Ted got their doctor to write up the descri ption, had Iona taken by ambulance for the examination, and the doctor called Rene Ca isse and told her that Ted was coming over with a prescription for Essiac."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR.

She read everything over and said, `What did you ha ve your wife operated on for?' I said, `They said she had a tumor of the stom ach. They operated and took it out. My wife couldn't eat. She hadn't eaten for a month.' She said, `Oh, well.' And she just went and got the bottle of Essiac. She said, `Now hide this under your clothes. I don't want people to see you taking it out of here. Everybody around's watching me. I'm under threat of spending the last day of my life in jail if I'm caught giving this to anybody: \"She told me how to give it to Iona: One ounce of the Essiac , measured out in an ounce shot glass, then pour it into another cup, then boil either distilled water or pure spring water-bring it right up to boil-then pour the boiling water in with the Essiac. She said that would cool it down pretty near to where Iona could drink it, and have her drink that the last thing before she's going to sleep at night. Don't have her eat anything for two hours before she takes it. Don't give her even a cup of coffee for two hours after she takes it.\" \"I couldn't eat anything, anyway,\" Iona said. \"So on the seventh day about 11:00, I sai d, `Iona, you haven't had any pain pills. Should I get you some?' She said, `No, I don' t want the pain pills. I don't need them anymore. I have no pain: And I said, Are you sure?' And she said, `Yes. I have no pain. I don't want any more pain pills. Ju st throw them away: She'd been taking so many of them that the doctor refused to increase her amount.\" \"The next morning,\" Iona said, \"I woke you up about four o'clock in the morning and said, `I'm so hungry:\" They both laughed, enjoying their memory of that wonderful moment. \"In the evening,\" Ted said, \"you asked for a small bowl of cornflakes. Then I got her a cup of coffee and she kept it down. Before that, everything she'd eat, it'd just fly right back on her. And then she went to th e bathroom all by herself. Then her bowels kept moving freely after that.\" \"I was down to 75 pounds when I got to where I could get on the scales,\" Iona said. I asked her what she had weighed initially. \"A hundred and fifty.\" \"So about a month after they operated on her,\" Ted said, \"her incision broke open and this cancer stone started to go soft a nd it drained out. It just kept draining out and draining out.\" \"All that day,\" Iona said, \"I didn't want to do anything but walk. I just kept walking. I felt as though I wanted to keep going.

Finally, that thing moved and it was just the worst stuff you ever saw It drained out.\" \"A cup full came out that night,\" Ted said. \"The doctor came down the next morning,\" Iona said, \"and called it a miracle.

Correct? \"Yeah.\" I asked her if they'd made that fact absolutely clear to her. \"The nurse came in one day and said, `You know you're going to die, don't you?' I said, `No, I never even thought a bout it. I was so burned on anyway, I guess it didn't matter to me, but she often told me I was going to die.\" I asked her if she'd had a pathe report when she was diagnosed that came back saying malignancy. \"Yeah,\" Iona said in barely a whisper. \"It was a tumor on the bowel.\" Then after the surgery, she had radiation tr eatments. Correct? \"Just to numb the pain where this lump was,\" Ted said. \"They sa id there was nothing more they could do for me,\" Iona said. I asked specifically how long they gave her to live when she left the hospital. \"They said about two days,\" Ted responded. I asked if they thought there was any hope at all. \"No,\" Ted said, trying to control his emot ions. He was on the verge of tears. \"We didn't think there was any hope.\" \"Nobody else around did either,\" Iona said. \"I went in to see my doctor afterwards and he stood there and looked at me and sa id, `Well, here's my miracle woman: He couldn't believe it.

Iona took a moment to ease herself. She thought it over before she answered. \"Because I was scared,\" she said. Then she tensed again: \"I thought if I told him I was on Essiac, they might give me a needle , or do something to me that would bring it all back again.\" There was real fear in her voice.

I didn't go down for all my checkups.\" I asked Iona when she had her last checkup. \"I guess I went down, what? Three times, eh?\" she said, looking over at Ted. \"Three times,\" Ted said. \"Last time we we nt down there I parked the car and ten minutes later, we were getting in and dr iving away My wife said, `No way I'm coming down here:\" They both laughed again. \"The doctor last time,\" Iona said, \"he just looked at my stomach and said, humm, if you keep on in the sun, you're going to be as black as I am: Because I tan quick. That's all he said to me and I got dressed.\" \"They kept sending her appointments, t hough,\" Ted said. \"Oh, yes, oh, yes,\" Iona laughed. I asked Iona if she'd had any prior experience with Essiac. \"Just what I'd heard Ted talking about. Even myself, I couldn't believe in it.\" Was there a shadow of doubt in her mind, I asked, that it was Essiac that caused the cancer to pass from her system? \"I wasn't on anything, only the pain pills,\" she said. \"That's all they were giving me. So it had to be the Essiac that brought me back, eh?\" I asked her if she felt as good as she looked. \"Certainly,\" she said. No hesitation. Did she ever talk to Rene Caisse? \"I never met her.\" If Rene were alive today and Iona could talk to her, what would she say? \"I'd be down on my knees, that's for sure,\" Iona responded instantly. \"I didn't get to meet her because they didn't want too many people going into her house.\" Rene's friend Mary agreed. \"Rene was pre tty scared at that time,\" Mary said. \"Everybody kept threatening her and phoning her. Imagine the pain she must have went through. She had one phone call where th ey said if she wouldn't tell them the formula, they'd beat it out of her. She said, `If you do that, you'll never find a thing. Just remember, it's not written down: So metimes she'd call me and say, `What are"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR.

I've had a call and there s somebody coming. I don't know who they are: I'd drop whatever I was doing and go. \"I'd stay in her kitchen, rattling the pans like there might be f our or five people out there.\" Mary laughed, remembering their little trick. \"And she'd talk to whoever was there. Afterwards, she'd say, `I'm ashamed to call you, but I'm scar ed to death. If it's a person in need and wants to talk to me, I can't turn them away: She was that kind to people.\" The conversation wandered for a few mi nutes through reminiscences of the treacheries Rene faced from various docto rs and researchers-and the ever-present threat of jail. Ted was fighting back tear s again, as we talked of how fearful Rene must have been. He mentioned that on his third visit to her, she was so frightened that she initially refused to give him any Essiac. \"She said, `I'm afraid to give you any. Th e police are watching my house: So I said, `Why be afraid to let me have a bottle to take home?' She said, `Because if they find that bottle on you, they'll take it off you and that'll be their proof to put me away:\" But Ted was a desperate man at that point. He promised to hide the bottle in his clothes. Then he promised hed never tell anybody. Then he finally pulled his German Lugar out of his belt and said he 'd use it if necessary. \"She said, `You wouldn't use that: I said, `I would so: She got pretty scared then.\" She gave him the bottle and he hid it under his jacket, but nobody stopped him on the way home. As we joked with Ted about his excessive enthusiasm for protecting Rene, he mentioned that he got himself in to hot water with her once. She was mad as hell at him. It was over money. \"She wouldn't take any money for a bottle, \" Ted said. \"She wouldrit take anybody's money. She wouldn't let you pay for it. So once when she went into the kitchen to get a bottle, I got out my purse and all I had in it was a $ 10 bill. I stuck it under a book on the desk and she brought the bottle out and gave it to me. \"When I went for the second bottle, she sat in her chair talki ng to me for about te n minutes, wanting to know how Iona was and everything, and then she went into the kitchen for the bottle. I got my purse out again and t ook a $50 bill and slipped it under the book and put the book over it. \"When I went for the third bottle, oh, boy, was she ever mad. Oh! I knocked on the door and she opened it and reached out and grabbed me by the front of the coat and yanked me right into the house. Slammed th e door right after me. She said, `I've got a bone to pick with you.' I said, `What'd I do wrong? I haven't been talking to anybody.' She said, `No, you haven't done that . But you left a $50 bill here the last time you were in my house. That`s an insu lt. I don't take money for my Essiac: She said, `You've got to take it back: So sh e reached down alongside her big chair and got her purse. \"I said, `Put it away. I won' t take it: She said, `You've got to take it: I said, `No, I don't have to take it. You keep that. Th e next fellow who comes to the door, maybe he can't afford to pay for a bottle, so ta ke some of that $50 and pay for his: She tucked it in her purse and put it on the fl oor and said, `Well, you put it that way, you can leave anything you like after this.\"' We all laughed.

She got more from the poor people than the rich.\" CHAPTER FOURTEEN Rene Caisse's family-dozens of nieces and nephews and cousins-is scattered all over Canada and the United States. Some of th em barely knew her or what she was doing. Others were close to her. One of her ni eces, Valleen Taylor, helped manage the clinic in the '30s. But even those who were supportive of Re ne have tended to play down the family connection, to shy away from publicity of any kind. They saw the crushing pressures Rene lived under, and they haven't been keen on the outside world intruding into their own lives. Cracking through the walls the family ha s built around itself over the decades is not an easy task. I was thrilled when one of Rene's close relations who knew her best-and is said by other family members to be extremely knowledgeable about the history of Essiac-agreed to see me after I' d been in town a few days and talking to people who'd lived there all their lives. In hi s eighties, but healthy and alert, he was polite, even warm, when the conversation was about the natural beauties of the Canadian northwoods and his own past adve ntures on several different continents. But he refused to let me turn on my tape recorder and when we began to discuss Rene, he pleaded ignorance and a failed memory-which was clearly not something he suffered from and quickly shifted into the role of questioner. Why was I there? What was I doing? We stood in my motel room and fenced lik e that for about fifteen minutes, and then he was giving me a friendly goodbye and sh aking my hand, then walking down the hallway He hadn't told me anything about Rene, and he hadn't been rude by refusing to see me. I was impressed. To this day I don't know for sure why he agreed to the meeting. I think he was just curious to meet this stranger who was going around town asking all the questions about Rene. He was willing to spend a few minutes to size up the situation, but he wasn't about ready to open himself up to an outsider, even one sympathetic to Rene. I had the strong feeli ng that I'd seen more evidence of the paranoia among the people who surrounded her during her life. But one of her relatives did open up to me. When I contacted him, he said he'd been wanting to tell his story for a long time. He was dying to talk to someone. For years he hadn't shared what he knew even w ith his own friends. It caused too many problems. He was afraid for his family. He was afraid for his business. He was afraid of the authorities. Hearing that someone was, after all these years, writing a book about Rene was enough to prompt him to talk. He wa nted to talk. Would I be able to guarantee-absolutely guarantee-his anonymity? I said yes, and meant it. He said he couldn't wait to see me. That night he drove to my motel, the Muskoka Riverside Inn in Bracebridge, and spent two hours reminisci ng in front of my tape recorder about"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 101 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 his relative Rene Caisse and his personal experience with Essiac. In his own words, here's his story: I can remember when she ran the clinic. I can remember going in the clinic and what it was like, and I can remember seeing people waiting there. I knew people who were in the clinic. She wore a nurse's uniform. She was very good, very accommodating to everybody. She was looked highly upon by the whole municipality and the surrounding area. She was always very professional, quite an astute lady in the re spect that she could be very hard and she could be very tender, and really quite business-like. Being very heavy and very much out of shape, and in not the best of health, I was amazed at what she accomplished. One of my aunts had cancer of the breast, I think. I didn' t delve into it, but someone had to actually carry her into Rene's clin ic. That was back in the 30s, I guess, and apparently the doctors had given up on her. She's still alive today. After the clinic closed, it was kind of a mystery to me. I knew she had people coming to her house, and it was pretty well all on the QT because it was against the law for her to give this medicine out. So the family never talked about it very much, but we were all very supportive and proud of her. I can remember asking: If this is such an important thing and it was so vi able, why wasri t she able to accomplish something legally with it? I would go and visit her quite often. She r eally liked to have visits from everybody. She quite openly talked about it, and many times I would ask her: Why is it that you can't do something? Well, she would explain that she could ha ve sold the formula for money, but the people were going to experiment with it on animals without giving it to human beings, and all of her life she had been experimenting with animals. She had gone to clinics in the states and in Montreal and all over, and as far as she was concerned, she had done all the experimenting that was necessary. All she wanted to do was cure humanity with the thi ng. But she was astute enough to realize that she wasn't going to give it to just anybody. She didn't wa nt to make a million dollars on it; that wasn't her goal. But she really wanted to make sure it didn't get into the wrong hands. She was dreadfully afraid. She was afraid that people would use it to their advantage to make a lot of money without helping humanity. That was really wh at she was afraid of. She was afraid of exploitation. She didn't mind the rich getti ng hold of it, if they would use it for humanity, but she was afraid that would ju st use it to make money for themselves. But really, I never did have it explained to my satisfaction why something couldn't be done to promote this thing and accommoda te her needs at the same time. I never could get it through my head. I never did ha ve it explained to th is very day why it couldri t have been done. She felt that the medical association was her mortal enemy, and the Cancer Society was her mortal enemy. The Cancer Society to her was bureaucratic, evil. They were hoodwinking the public, the money wasn't be ing spent where it should have been spent, and she told me of many instances. Right from the day I met her until the day she died, the medical association and the Cancer Society were her very deep foes."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 102 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 She felt very strongly that the Cancer Soci ety did not want to find a cure. She said that over and over again. \"T hey do not want to find a cure.\" There are too many people making too much money out of funds and grants for cancer. She claimed that it was bureaucratic larceny. It was a public fraud to beat all public frauds. She was in a total state of frustration for most of her later life because her phone would be continuously ringing from peopl e wanting help, and she very seldom turned anybody down. But she was so scar ed of the Mounties coming and putting her in jail. She would say that over and over again. I would go for medicine. I would go for a little-the whole family got medicine from her-but she would never let me watch her make the Essiac. She might have let some of the family in, but I don't think so. Sh e made the formula in the evenings by herself-other than Mary helped her. She would always wrap the bottles in news paper and she would put it in a brown paper bag and say, \"Now you carry that out as though it's Christmas cake or something.\" I'm sure she did this with everybody. I've gone to her home many times and people would be there. She'd tell me, Oh, that person's from such and such and that person's from Saskatoon, and this person came up from Albuquerque. People would phone her and beg her for medi cine. I don't think she really charged. I really don't. I know that she got a lot of gifts from peopl e. She would point out gifts that she got from somebody shed cured. If she got money, she didn't get a lot of money. I don't think she asked for money Sh e might have asked for a donation, but I know that she gave a lot of it away for sure. Oh, I know she had a hard tim e getting the herbs. The amazing thing I really can't get through my head is: You take the supposed cures they have for cancer now A lot of the cures have a very ill-effect on the human body. These herbs never hurt anybody. As a matter of fact, she insist ed that they were a tremendous blood purifier. When I was 18, I quit school and got a j ob prospecting with a mining company. They'd found uranium. I was out for about six months, I guess, and when I came back, I was out drinking beer with the fellas and I started bringing up blood. They took me to the hospital and I had a duodena l ulcer, a very bad ulcer. The doctor gave me a long list of things that I had to eat and a bunch of milk. He said you keep taking it and by the look of that ulcer, it's going to take about six months to cure. When I got home, my mother phoned Rene and sent me over. I got a couple of bottles of her Essiac and I took it for about a month. You take it before you go to bed every night, the way she tells you to take it in a glass of warm water, and it's super stuff. Like, you feel good. Mentally it does you a hell of a lot of good. It's like taking a tonic. It's no big deal . It's just a bunch of herbs. I went for a regular X-ray and the ulcer was completely cured. The doctor couldn't figure it out. There wasri t even a trace of an ulcer. The doctor couldn't believe it. He showed me. I can remember him showing me the two X-rays. The one showed a huge ulcer. The other was clean. But I didn't tell him I'd been taking Essiac. Under oath I couldn't tell him about the Essiac. It was something you never talked about. I never talked to my friends about it. She would go to jail if anyone talked about it. Just to show you how deep it is, the whole family took Essiac, a nd only one person in the family ever died"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 103 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 of cancer. And she was the one who didn't take it. Rene was death against the knife, and sh e was death against radium, and she was death against this chemotherapy. She said it was just like water and oil, Essiac and this chemotherapy. People who knew I was re lated to Rene Caisse would come to me and say, \"Listen, how do I get hold of Essiac?\" If I knew them well enough, I'd say, \"Well, I'll try and get you a bottle, or two bottles, or whatever.\" Rene would ask me two or three questions. Shed say, \"Is your friend taking chemotherapy? If they're ta king chemotherapy, then I don't even want to give it to you. It's just a waste. Have they had surgery? Are they taking radium treatments?\" If they had chemotherapy, she wouldn't give it. If they'd had a knife or radium treatments, she would give them the medici ne, but she said once they have the knife, the knife seemed to produce mo re cancer. When they trie d to cut the cancer out, it seemed to inflame the cancer and spread it. That was her theory. The radium-she felt it did more harm than good. She said it killed a lot of cancer, but it also killed a lot of people. But she felt her medicine could still help and could still take away the pain. She said it would definitely relieve pain. Just that, if it did nothing else, it would relieve the pain, and if it did nothing else, it would pur ify the blood. She also stated that it was good for the prostate, obviously good for ulcers, and it was just a complete cleansing. That's why I've been taking it on and off all my life. I can remember in the 50s-or maybe the late 40s-going to visit her quite a bit. She really liked to have us come. She was a heavy woman and found it hard to get around. It was an effort for her to go to the front door, but she baked for everybody, she gave everybody presents for Christmas, even the little kids and the nephews. She was always cheery. She had a good sens e of humor, and she was always strong. I remember one time she broke a hip, and you could tell that she was in great pain, but she would never let on. She also painte d. She was extremely prolific. She would do maybe four or five paintings a week, or more, and she was always giving away her paintings. Like you couldrit go there without getting something because she always wanted to give you something. My impression was that she was a very strong person, an extremely strong person, not only strong-willed, but strong physically. I was actually surprised that she lasted as long as she did, and I think the reason was that she had a goal in life. Her goal was to let the world know about Essiac so that people could get better by it. If she hadn't had that goal, I think she would have died years ago. The worst thing that could be said about Rene was that she was stubborn. She was a strong person who would say her piece, a nd she was able to stand up on her hind heels and talk in front of an audience. Bu t they could never say that she wasn't fair or a humanitarian. I would be safe in saying that anybody who knocked on her door would be let in, and under duress for Rene. Like anybody w ho phoned her long distance and said, \"If I come to your door, can you help me?\" I can remember her saying to me that she had to say no to these people, but I also know that she relented under pressure from these people, saying, okay, come on."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"CALLING OF AN ANGEL by DR. GARY L. GLUM http://garyglum.hotbox.ru/callingofanangel.htm 104 of 105 02/11/2005 15:21 You know what's funny is that a lot of doc tors-and I could never figure this out-felt that she was helping people. But the doc tors wouldri t admit it. In this little community, as an example, she knew a coupl e of doctors who really believed in her. She also knew quite a few docto rs who were dead against it, and she kind of felt that the doctors who believed in her were scared to say anything. She felt that the doctors had a bit of occ upational loyalty to the medical association, and she felt that the medical associat ion held a wand over these doctors. I know there were doctors who came to her to ge t Essiac for patients, and yet they didn't help her. They didn't help her! It's kind of a mystery to me, it really is. I know just lately there are doctors in this community who will give out Essiac. I have talked to one doctor and told him that I'd heard that he would give out Essiac if his patients have cancer. He said, \"Who told you that?\" I said, \"Well, I just heard it, and I happen to be one of Rene Caisse's relatives. I just want you to know that I admire you for doing it.\" He said, \"Well, you don't have to tell anybody.\" She felt that money was the big thing behind it all. She felt that the Cancer Society was a farce. She felt it was a moneymaki ng scheme that would be an everlasting money-making scheme as long as a cure for cancer was never found. As far as the medical associ ation was concerned, she felt that they were so powerful that the doctors daren't breathe a word. It wasn't so much money with the medical association. The doctors were afraid of losing their credibility, losing everything. But she insisted it was strictly money with the Cancer Society. I think the reason she finally released th e formula to Resperin was because they promised her that they would actually us e it on human beings. They would give it out to people who actually had cancer. I' m not sure she lived long enough to realize that Resperin wasn't getting very far. I feel really bad about that. I felt good at first when that article came out in Homemaker's. I thought, oh, gee, at last she's going to get recognition and it's going to start going. Now that she's dead and the Resperin Corporation doesn't seem to be doing anything with it and Mary's on her last legs, you know, it doesn't look good at all. I've often wondered, is this formula ju st going to evaporate? Is nothing going to happen with it? I feel very bad about it, ve ry sad. We need to be able to give to humanity what's there, what is available right in front of us, and nobody is doing it. The very fact that this thing may die, it's just making me sick. Just making me sick. My perception is that she helped thousands of people. She used to help all kinds of people that I knew I'm talking about peopl e who significantly benefited. She always used to say that she only got the people that the doctors gave up on. She never got the people before they were either treated or the doctors gave up on them. She had a cure for cancer. She has got a cure for cancer. We all knew A lot of the family were cured. I think even maybe Va lleen has been cured. We knew that she could cure cancer, and I think something that we were always afraid of-every single one of us-was the fact that we knew so mebody in the family who could cure cancer and that this cancer cure was going to die with Rene.

The frustration of having the cure, but not be ing able to talk about it was terrible. Terrible. What can we do to help her? How can we help? Even today, the whole thing has connotations of a mystery type of thing. Unfortunately, people are forgetting about Rene. She was a legend, especially when she had the clinic, but even in her later y ears just before she died. But I would say now that most people younger than 60 real ly aren't aware that something very special was going on here in Bracebridge. @pochta.ru @pochta.ru »»» <name>"}]
