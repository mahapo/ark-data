[{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 1 CANCER IS CURABLE ! This book is written for you, Carolyne!   anti - cancer.weebly.com "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 2 Dear friend, You are reading this because you want to know how to cure cancer. It is curable! The first thing you need to understand : cancer is just a disease ( let’s say, some kind of disbalane in your body) , the same like rhinitis (cold). Cold was considered to be a huge problem in the past, but today most of the people know how to cure it. It’s not a big deal. The same is applicable to cancer! You see, there are no incurable diseases, there are only people who do not know how to cure them! Read this book and you will know “how”. I decided to write this book because I’ve felt there is a need for it. Looking back at my life I can say that most of my family members and relatives that have passed away died from cancer, cardio- vascular diseases or alcohol. I know that it happens in all families. But as I figured out , people die from cancer not because there is no cure, but just because they do not have enough qualitative information plus they are not ready to perceive new information, believing they already know everything about life. The information I collected in this book is the most valuable knowledge on this subject, I’ve bee n accumulat ing during my life ( when there is first -person narration in the text , it’s always the words of those authors who actually wrote this book). The information was collected from different sources: books and articles, most of the things I tried myse lf, found them very practical and share them with you. Why? Because t hat’s what works in my life. Biologically we are practically identical. If it works in my life, I’m sure it will work the same way in your life too! What is good, there is no need to believe in my words. There’s no need to believe me at all! It will be even better if you doubt everything written here and investigate the subject for yourself. But for now, all you’ll need while reading the book is to use your logics and good sense. Just prepare your opened mind, put the sets of your belie fs aside for a few hours, it won’t hurt you, and be ready to investigate the information presented here. In our society we are taught to believe there are three main ways to cure cancer: 1) To take chemic als (a huge amount of poison) into a sick body, hoping that the poison will kill the disease earlier than the person. 2) To fry the body with rays , hoping the disease will be burnt out and destroyed before the rest of the person’s health. 3) To cut a part of the body . As we can see, a ll three approaches follow the same patterns: a) destruction as the main principle for healing b) playing the “ Russian roulette”: Who is the first one to quit - the patient or cancer? c) fighting the symptoms , rather than the real root of the disease. "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 3 Our conventional medicine’s successful rate to cure cancer is approximately 2% . Would you call it a success? If the rate is so low why than most people still believe in the se approaches and trust in them? And again, it’s lack of information + FEAR . But there are other less destructive and more efficient approaches too. One of the main mistakes made by people who face cancer - they rely upon only one or two approaches only. Why so? Out of fear. In most cases the choice of the treatment is made out of fear. Where there is fear , there can be no freedom of making a good choice . And if it turns out that the chosen approach is not effective, the person simply doesn’t know that there are other options and loses her/his hope. And it’s the worst thing that can happen. So, all I ask you to do is to put your fear aside for a few hours (while reading) and to give yourself a chance to investigate other approaches. And once you are well informed you will have more options to defeat ca ncer fast and effectively.  , @ P.S. I also set up a site : www.anti-cancer.weebly.com There I uploaded a few e -books and videos that may also be very useful for you. It’s all yours! Check it! Vitally important information should be available for everyone and be shared for FREE !  "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 4 BRIEFLY ABOUT BASIC PRINCIPLES TO DEFEAT CANCER A human is a complicated system. Besides my body I have my consciousness (mind, psychic, subconsciousness , intuition e.t.c.). The body and consciousness are interdependent, like two sides of a piece of paper. I cannot hit one side without influencing the opposite. So, influencing positively both, body and my mind, I’ll regain good heath much faster. For that I’ll need: BODY MIND 1) CLEANSING In case of cancer, immune system is weak and hormone system does not work properly. When the body is helped to get rid of toxins, parasites, weak and damaged cells, the immune and hormone systems start working properly, thus the body gets a chance to cure itself maximum effectively. When I start understanding that mind has a bad habit of switching to negative destructive thoughts or repeating them over and over again, I need cleanse my mind, replace destruct ive thoughts, switch my attention (thoughts and activity) to something more constructive, bringing more joy and harmony . 2) APPROPRIATE FUEL (FOOD) Body works properly when it’s given appropriate fuel: raw, not cooked fruits and vegetables is the best food. Fresh air and water + physical activity are very important too. As well as the body, my mind also needs appropriate food - positive, inspirational information and experiences (thoughts, books, films, music, activities, communication) 3) EL IMINATION OF NEGATIVE FACTORS Cooked food, meat, alcohol, smoking, drugs, negative destructive thoughts, stressful situations, communication with people adding stress or negativity. All this will be further discussed in the book. AND REMEMBER, YOU DON’T HAVE TO BE ALONE! IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT STEPS TO TAKE FIRST, YOU CAN ALWAYS FIND GOOD SPECIALISTS WHO ARE EXPERIENCED IN HELPING PEOPLE TO DEFEAT CANCER! "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 5 1 ELIMINATE NEGATIVE FACTORS TOXINS The main sources of toxins: our food and air . M ost o f the toxins come through our digestive system, the rest of them we receive through lungs and skin. How does our body deal with an excessive amount of toxins ? A human body is a wonderful mechanism that protects the most important organs from toxins (first of all it protects brain and heart). Our body is smart and takes the excess of toxins out of the “city” to a “city’s junkyards”. In other words, when the body can not remove toxins, it moves them into peripheric tissues, that are less important for l ife sustenance . When a person becomes older (30 -40 years old ) the “junkyards ” of toxic deposits in the tissues and ligaments are full to the limits. That’s when the body has to start storing these toxic deposits in the life sustaining organs and systems - that’s when the pathological changes start. The first example: atherosclerosis of blood vessels belongs to cardio- vascular diseases. It causes heart and brain diseases, to name: stenocardia, ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular accident (stroke). All of the are the main killers in the world. They take the first place in death rate. One of two people on earth dies from cardio - vascular diseases . It is 50% of all deaths in the world ! The second main “killer ” in the world is cancer . The main cause o f cancer is intoxication. There are different theories of cancer origin , but let ’s not forget that 100 years ago cancer was a very rare disease. The statistics we have shows that approximate number of death from cancer was less than 3%. What do we see now ? Every third person on earth dies from cancer . And it’s more than 30% ! I’ll tell you about the third main killer later, but let’s continue for now. So, now we know that at least 80% of all deaths in the world are caused by cardio- vascular diseases and ca ncer. And now let’s see what we can learn on this subject from our Mother Nature:"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 6 If we take wild life, we’ll figure out that no animals, no other creatures suffer from cardio- vascular diseases. Why so? But what about cancer? For many years scientists could not find any cancer in wild nature as well. Only recently there are a few reports stating that very rarely it can be found. Only a few very old animals out of millions, living in a polluted environment might have cancer. So, as we can see, the main two killers among humans are not known in wild nature! Cardio -vascular diseases and cancer are the diseases of civilization! What is so different between us and the animals living in wild? We breathe the same air. Even if it’s polluted, they are healthy, but we are sick. Maybe it is lack of motion? But latest studies in Oxford and other research institutes show that the contemporary person moves not less than his/ her ancestors who lived 100 years ago. Moreover , they compared our activity to the one of the animals in wild nature and figured out that the amount of energy we spend is identical. So, it turned out that hypodynamia (lack of motion) is just another myth. What about our food? It seems that it ’s the only difference. Human is the only creature that takes the food from nature and destroys it before eating. Even the animals that live with man start catching the same diseases! Human is the only creature that thinks he is smarter than Nature, that is why he/she thinks it is smart enough to eat inappropr iate food, to eat inedible, to eat destroyed food and mix it as he/she wishes. And still he/she hopes to keep his/her body strong and healthy. As we can see, 80% of all deaths in the world are caused directly by our “god” that we call COOKING. We worship it everyday in all thinkable forms. Can you imagine? During the course of the human history, COOKING has killed more people than all the wars, all the catastrophes, all the disasters, accidents and the diseases combined together!!!! COOKING is the most destructive invention in the whole human history, it is even more destructive than nuclear weapons. Eliminate from your life all the main toxic sources – dead food, alcohol, smoking, drugs, medication, destructive drinks (cola, coffe e...) , destructive thoughts , destructive contacts and you will be able to restore the purity of your body and return to your good health. Don’ t think you are smarter than Nature. Take her gifts in the same form"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 7 as she gives them, and you will be as healthy as the rest of the ani mals that live in the wild according to natural laws and do not cook. * The most valuable research on toxins was published in a book of an American doctor John H. Tilden “Toxemia explained” (1926 ) . We will continue exploring h ow to cleans e the body fr om all the toxins in more details in the next chapters. Now , let’s investigate and understand what powerful tools we already have for our healing. "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 8 2 POWERING OUR BODY \"You know that what you eat you are \" (George Harrison, 1968 ) We alread y k now that toxins in our body are one of the main sources of all the illnesses, including incurable, such as cancer. If you want to change your life, change your diet! Here we’ll explore what to eat and why. Shortly and simply, considering it mechanically, energetically and chemically, it can be said that man's body is being powered simultaneously by at least four systems : digestive , breathing, skin and direct (pineal). If I was to draw a picture describing percentage quotas of the systems powering the body of a statistical inhabitant of Earth (if at all it is possible to define this), I would write the following amounts: •about 20% digestive system; •about 45% breathing system; •about 35% skin system; •about 1% direct system. The sum is 101% because the amounts are approximate. Also this depends on an individual person — the proportions may differ quite much. You may consider the above quotas as estimates, graphical presentation of the relation between the body powering systems. Rather do not consider it to be scientific data. Beside this, the proportions are changing, they depend on the life style a person follows. For example, i n case of persons living on a very small amount of food, who regularly do breathing exercises and expose the skin to the sunsh ine, these proportions will be different, something like: skin 40 %, breathing 4 5%, eating 15 % . You probably have experienced such changes of the proportions. When you spent more time doing spiritual (mental) exercises, you wanted to eat less. Similar thing happen when you are doing energizing exercises or you spend much time on a sunny beach. During sunny summer human wants to eat less than he/she does during cloudy winter. I'm going to describe in short the human body powering systems. "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 9 DIGESTIVE SYSTEM Some people wonder why different people, although they consume food which differs a lot by the composition and amount, are quite similar in their stature and weight. This happens even if the daily lives (environment, work, physical activity) of these pers ons are very similar. Another real example: A man who weighs 120 kg ( 264.6 lb) eats two slices of bread and drinks two cups of coffee a day only, but he does not lose any weight. In the same day his peer eats six loafs, two sausages, half liter (0.53 qt.) of milk, three glasses of tea, biscuits, fruits and something else, and he remains slim. They are of the same stature and have similar amount of physical activity. You probably could give more examples like these, if not then it would be enough to look around and compare people regarding this matter. Such examples make it clear that there is no absolute connection between the amount of eaten food, it is composition and the body appearance or how much life energy man has. Why does it happen like this? If bigger quantity of eaten food would give more life energy, than people who eat more should feel more energized. There is even so called “energetic value” of food (efficient tool for manipulating people). An amount of grease has this many calories, of milk h as less and of saccharose has more calories, and so on. But why eating bigger amount of sugar with fat causes man to feel worse than when he drinks the same quantity of fruit juice or just water? Why after a big and satiating meal man, instead of radiating with energy, is lazy and weakened? Since our childhood we have been under this suggestion: “Eat more to be stronger.” It is a pity how the children are being cheated by the use of the suggestion, which later in their life results with so much suffering: diseases, aging and earlier body death. Eaten food does not give much energy to the body. All eaten food causes the opposite reaction, it forces the body to spend energy for decomposing, neutralizing and excreting it all. Exactly, the body uses its own energy for transforming and excreting what man inserted in the digestive track. Also the other answer can be astonishing. Eaten food does not build human body cells. It has an impact on how they are built and how they function but it does not build them. The body does not directly build its cells from eaten food. Surprised? What does the body do with eaten food? The body removes the food wholly , if it works properly. The body removes the superfluous, poisoning substances with feces, urine, sweat, saliva, seb um, blood, breath, hair, nails and epidermis. But if there is something wrong with the body work (in the present civilization this is normal, in other words, there are almost no ideally healthy people) , then , it deals differently with part of the eaten foo d. Part of it is stored (e.g as fat, glycogen), other part is put aside for later removal (those substances which need more energy, e.g. heavy metals , toxins ). It seems that human body is a machine producing and removing waste, polluting the environment. With this action it follows the law of changes in nature. The more man eats, the less life energy man has, the faster ages and earlier wears out (kills) the body. Every machine wears out, the human body is no exception to this . "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 10 BREATHING SYSTEM This is , of course, about the lungs which provide the body with air and remove gaseous substances, mainly carbon dioxide, that are products of matter transformation. Breathing, without question, is the most important physical practice for maintaining physical life. Without breathing life ceases within a few minutes. By contrast, most any human body might survive for months without consuming solid food and a week or more without taking liquid. Of course, many individuals might die more quickly if they do not have food and water due to their bad health, toxins, and, which is even more important, due to their fear and mistaken belief. Analysis of the human body shows that it consists of 65% oxygen, 18% carbon, 10% hydrogen, and 3% nitrogen. A total of 96% of the hu man body is made from these four elements, all of which are available in the air we breathe. One can also say that the body is about 70% water, since most of the hydrogen and oxygen atoms are combined in this form of molecule. The other 4% of body mass consists of 37 trace minerals, all present in ocean water. If one felt it necessary he/she could take a sip each day or immerse themselves in ocean water where the minerals could be absorbed through the semi - permeable membrane called skin. The lungs have another important task, it has been proven scientifically they produce proteins out of nitrogen we breathe in with air. A human breathes in 15-25 kilograms (33 -55 lb.) of air daily (compare it to 2- 3 kg (4.4 -6.6 lb.) of food). Besides other gases, the air t hat we breathe contains nitrogen, which can be transformed into protein. But a few people know the fact that the body has a system of digestion of nitrogen from air, transforming it into protein. In the first part of the 20 th century academician I.M. Sechenov noticed that arterial blood carried high level of nitrogen. That led to an assumption that it could be used by body for building itself. Later, M.I. Volskiy made a discovery proving that nitrogen from air transforms into protein of human body by means of bacteria that exist in upper air passages and large intestine. His computation shows that due to the difference in amount of nitrogen in arterial (1,6%) and venous blood (1,34%), the human body receives approximately 14,5 liters (3,83 gal.) of nitroge n, which is equal to 18 grams. This amount of nitrogen is enough to produce 112 grams of protein. American scientists E. Franzblau and K. Coppa also proved the fact that the body can absorb and transform the nitrogen directly for the air. Breathing exerc ises are beneficial for our health. P roper breathing is to charge the body with more life energy. These exercises, if properly done, have the power to heal the psych e and the body. Deep breathing produces real and sustained energy enhancement. Athletes, such as runners, swimmers, and bicyclists breathe deeply for sustenance; they do not eat while performing. Chronically insufficient oxygen intake, whether from shallow breathing, polluted air, or physical impairment reduces vitality, stresses the human body, weakens defense mechanisms, and ultimately shortens life span. The average human utilizes perhaps 25% of his/her potential lung capacity, thus robbing the body of vital oxygen. The oxygen, collected by the lungs passes through membranes into the miraculous blood system of veins and capillaries, to be distributed to every cell in the body. This same system removes the waste of depleted, replaced cells and carries it to the eliminative system. Human skin performs a similar function of respiration."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 11 A human ca n benefit from the daily practice of deep breathing clean air, especially when combined with physical exercise. If possible, it is good to expose the body and the eyes to sunlight, daily. One hour of these practices seems reasonable. Drink clean rain water , filtered water, of distilled water. Avoid drugs, medicines, pollutants, and any other powerful substances, if possible. SKIN SYSTEM The skin is the largest organ of human body. The skin, as the lungs, breathe s and perform s the same tasks as the lungs d o. Beside this the skin absorbs the radiation coming from the sun, so it is this part of the body where photosynthesis takes place. The skin synthesizes some substances for the body, for example vitamin D. The skin is also a detector of, among others, temp erature, humidity, consistency and radiation. Through this organ many gaseous and liquid substances can enter the body. Performing this function the skin acts in similar way as the intestines. Thanks to the skin the body can remove many superfluous substances, so it is also an excreting organ. Gases, perspiration, mucus and sebum, which make the body to smell in specific way, are substances containing toxins being excreted. From the above one can conjecture that putting cosmetics (creams, shampoos, lipsti cks, powders) on the skin makes them to be absorbed by the body. Then they circulate with the blood and poison the body, giving the cleaning system more work to do. Often they also set in the body which later, after a few, a dozen or more years, results in form of illnesses. So , before you put on your body any cosmetic s, think about it. For example, if a shampoo that you want to use, you can drink without later suffering any body problems, then most probably it is suitable for washing the hair. Similarly is with a cream, if it is not digestible then it also is not suitable for the skin. DIRECT SYSTEM (pineal) The pineal body is an internal secretion (endocrine) gland which is placed approximately in the center of the head. This gland, fully active since bir th, begins to slowly atrophy reaching the dimension of a pea in an adult. The common opinion is that then it is role is quite limited. Let me add as a curiosity that the pineal is the only human body part which does not become ill. The natural size of the pineal (which have not atrophied) in case of an adult is comparable to the dimension of a ping -pong ball. In such a state it is fully active thus enabling human to use many abiliti es commonly thought as fantasy . So called psychical exercises make the pineal more active and physically enlarge it. Tests made using computer tomography on some people who practice long periods of non- eat ing and fastings proved that their pineal bodies were approximately twice as big as in case of a statistical Earth human. Th e more active is the pineal the less powering for the body is needed from the other sources. "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 12 OUR FOOD Most people that eat less , compared to people eating “normally”, feel much more life energy in themselves . It lets them keep higher physical and psychi cal activity for many hours a day without even feeling tired, like it happens to an artist under inspiration. Higher level of life energy in intellectual sphere often manifests by higher creativity. In this state it is much easier for the human to create, invent, teach, learn and work. High level of life energy in those who eat less is not an extraordinary phenomena. The body uses up to 90% of its energy for digesting and eliminating . The body of a person who eats less does not need so much energy for dige stion and elimination of wastes , this is where the surplus of usable energy comes from. If a person has not experienced this difference on their own body, it is difficult for him/her to believe and comprehend it. What has happened to the divine being calle d the human, who has made his/her body a digesting and eliminating machine? It is easy to experience the fact that there more the human eats, the weaker he/she becomes. Having eaten a large meal, are you willing to work? Do you feel energized or weaker? M any people notice that there more they eat, the weaker and more lazy they become. This common saying: “eat to be strong” is actually opposite to what people experience. It happens like this because the more food falls into the stomach, the more work the body has to do which means there more life energy is used for digestion and elimination. Eating something may take just a few minutes but digesting and eliminating it takes a few dozen of hours. When the body cannot stand the overload, the body starts to fu nction unwell that is, it becomes fat, gets ill, ages and finally dies. This is why fasting is one of most efficient healing methods widely known on the Earth. This is a new, true saying: Eat less in order to have more life energy, more creativity and cle aner body, then most of common illnesses making people suffer will not harm you. Of course, limiting food intake below the certain level also is harming because it weakens and deprives the human of energy. Body and mind function best when the rational balance is followed. COMMON SENSE SEPARATES TRUTH FROM FICTION If you want to destroy something, set fire to it! If you want to destroy the vital elements within any food, cook it! The more heat - the more destruction! • Temperatures of 118 degrees Fahrenheit or more destroy critical enzymes within food. The result: Digestion can suffer and food can travel, undigested, into your small intestine, where it putrefies, poisoning your blood. Enzymes are critical to life and need to be present within food for opti mal digestion. • Cooking leaches minerals out of food. Nobody has studied the effect of minerals as extensively as Dr. Joel Wallach. He has performed 17500 autopsies on 454"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 13 species and on 3000 humans and has proved they all died of some sort of mineral defi ciency. He was nominated in 1991 for the Nobel Prize in Medicine. • Cooking also destroys vitamins, which are needed to control the absorption and use of minerals. • Whenever fat is cooked, transfatty acids are produced. Transfatty acids are one of the most destructive elements of any cooked food diet. They decrease testosterone, and interfere with pregnant animals. They are a major source of damaging free radicals and research shows that chefs who spend time wok or pan- frying have a higher incidence of lung cancer. Cooked food is cancerigenic. • When you eat cooked food, your body has to release copious amounts of enzymes in order to break down the food. Without enzymes, your food would never digest. According to Dr Edward Howell, your enzyme supply is limited and cooked food eventually runs it down to dangerously low levels. Are you shocked? Do you immediately want to eliminate ALL cooked food from your diet? This chapter is a wake- up call designed to open your mind and get you thinking in new directions. All you need to do for now is begin considering the importance of raw 'living' foods. You'll soon learn, if they don't form the foundation of your diet, you'll have no foundation at all. HUMANITY'S MOST IMPORTANT BATTLE: RAW FOOD VERSUS COOKED FOOD In their book, Goldot, Lewis E. Cook Jr. and Junko Yasui recount a very powerful study. The study was performed on three groups of rats and the results were fascinating. Take a look for yourself before you come to the same conclusions as the researchers. GROUP O NE From birth, the first group of rats were fed a raw diet of fruits, vegetables, nuts, and whole grains. As they grew they experienced every sign of good health. They grew fast. They had strong bodies. They were free from disease. They were also free from excess fat. They reproduced with vigour and enthusiasm and paved the way for their healthy offspring. They were vivacious, spirited, and very affectionate to one another. As soon as they reached the equivalent of 80 human years they were put to sleep and autopsied. Researchers found that every organ, every gland, and every tissue was in perfect condition. A diet of raw food prevented them from experiencing the 'normal' signs of ageing and degeneration. GROUP TWO From birth, this unlucky group of rats was fed a diet of cooked foods: Milk, meat, white bread, soda, sweets, cakes, vitamins and medicines. As they grew they experienced many of the same diseases that afflict people in present day society such as colds, fevers, pneumonia, poor eyesight, cataracts, heart disease, arthritis, cancer, etc. But it wasn't just their biological health that was on the line. Their emotional health was also very unstable as they constantly attacked each other. They gave birth to offspring that were constantly ill and aggress ive. Death came prematurely to this group from diseases or various epidemics that swept through the entire colony. Autopsies revealed extensive"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 14 degeneration to every organ, every gland, and every tissue of their bodies. The researchers had found a very impressive way to accelerate the speed in which the rats aged - by feeding them a diet similar to what most humans eat. The rats paid the ultimate price - early death from disease. GROUP THREE From birth, this group was fed the same foods as Group Two until they reached an equivalent human age of 40. They displayed behavioural characteristics identical to those in the previous group and had the same poor quality of health. At the end of this 'equivalent 40 year period' the rats were placed on a strict water f ast for a number of days before being introduced to a 100% raw food diet, coupled with periods of fasting. The changes were dramatic. Within one month they began showing signs of exceptional health. They became affectionate, playful and more resilient to i nfection, showing no signs of illness or disease. At the end of an 'equivalent 80 year period', autopsies revealed that this group had completely reversed all biological signs of ageing. Every organ, every gland, and every tissue was in perfect condition. WARNING: IF THE FOUNDATION OF YOUR DIET ISN'T BUILT ON RAW LIVING FOODS - THERE IS NO FOUNDATION THE POWER OF ENZYME RICH RAW FOOD AND THE PERILS OF ENZYME -LESS COOKED FOOD In the 1930s, Dr Paul Kouchakoff demonstrated that after eating cooked food, there is an increase m the mobilisation of white blood cells in the body, a phenomenon called 'digestive leukocytosis'. When faced with too much enzyme- less cooked food, your body will recruit white blood cells (leukocytes) to transport a large quantity of enzymes, for the task of breaking down food particles. In other words, when your body is unable to properly digest food, white blood cells will attack the food, in an effort to reduce it to usable components or eliminate it from the body. Until Kouchakof f's work, this was considered normal but Kouchakoff found that when foods are consumed in their raw state, digestive leukocytosis does not occur. Raw foods have just the right amount of natural enzymes/nutrients within them to allow them to perfectly self -digest within your digestive system. This leads to better digestion and assimilation. The message is simple: • Processed food and cooked food reliably triggers off leukocyte mobilisation. • Raw 'living' foods have no such effect. • When you add raw 'living' foods to your meal , you reduce leukocyte mobilisation dramatically. "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 15 WARNING: COOKED FOOD CAUSES YOUR ORGANS TO WORK FIVE TIMES THEIR NORMAL CAPACITY AND EXHAUST PREMATURELY It's about time more and more people questioned the use of cooked food in their diet, including you. The foundation of your health can be built only on raw food . Once you've experienced the true power of raw food you'll look at cooked food differently. You'll still want to eat certain foods, because they'll be critical in completing your own personal fuel mixture. When you do select these foods, you'll be doing so CONSCIOUSLY - not just because you are a victim of the sales and marketing tactics orchestrated to suck you in and part with your hard earned cash. The researches performed by G. Shatalova show that an average person with traditional eating habits in the state of rest has power inputs 5 times l arger, than the people who keep to her recommendations and eat less. An average person breaths 4- 5 times more frequent and consumes the amount of food 5 times larger than necessary. It means that the body of an average person wears out much faster. PROTEIN There is an erroneous view the body’s main source of protein is meat and dairy produce. But in fact, meat, when it’s cooked has no protein at all. At 117 Fahrenheit protein is totally destroyed. All you’ll get out of meat is just fat, calories and huge amount of toxic matter. The same with milk : the human digestive system does not have enzymes for dairy products digestion. We are not calves. Cow milk is totally different in it’s structure and does not suit for humans. The best what the body can do with dairy products is to expel them from the body. Moreover, dairy products cause osteoporosis . When you hear about living bifidus bac teria in yogurt, and how healthy they are to eat, you should acknowledge that it is just another marketing trick. Even if these fabulous living bacteria are alive and you eat them, they go into your stomach where they will be killed by gastric juice which mainly is a hydrochloric acid. Only babies are able to consume and digest their mothers’ milk (not cow’s!). The scientific studies show that a baby’s daily milk consumption is 100 grams. This milk contains approximately 2 grams of protein. Yet the baby is able to double his/her weight within the first 6 months. If a baby’s initial weight is 4 kilograms (8.8 lb.) , this means that each kilogram (2.2 lb.) of the body receives only 0,5 grams of protein. Half of that amount is spent for metabolic processes and energy exchange processes, the other half is spent for growth. This means that an average person needs only 15- 18 grams of protein a day. Why a medical norm, which has been set without any reasons, is set at a level of 100 grams of protein per day then? When diet articles or medical people talk about norms for food consumption and calories, they address the norms that have never been scientifically substantiated. For you to know, these “norms” were elaborated by German scientists in the 19 th century and were based on an average consumption of food by an average German person of the 19 th century. After that, no one even tried to check if the norms were accurate or not. "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 16 We already know that the protein in our body can be produced in lungs directly from nitrogen which can be found in air we breath e. Another powerful factory producing minerals, vitamins and protein is located right in our large intestine. There we have up to 2- 3 kg (4.4- 6.6 lb.) of friendly bacteria that are part of our digestive system, they consume raw foods (only raw plant foods!) and produce most of the protein for our body. That is why vegans can be good athletes too and never face emaciation – their protein comes directly from raw fruits, nuts and vegetables. In the middle of the 20 th century there existed a common erroneous opinion that there are indispensable amino acids that we get only if we consume dairy products and meat. It was believed that a few amino acids can not be found in vegetable food. That assumption was proven wrong . There is no such thing as indispensable amino acid s, there is only lack of knowledge. Look at nature: take a bull, or an elephant, or a gorilla, or a hippopotamus , or a giraffe – all of them eat only raw vegan food, yet it seems they are perfectly well and have no problems with their protein. Their bodies are among the strongest on the earth. There are thousands of similar examples that you can find yourself. WHAT TEMPERATURE S DESTROY ALL THE NURTIENT S IN OUR FOOD? Let’s see at what temperatures our food becomes dangerous poisons and waste: NUTRIENT DESTR OYED AT: Protein 42C - 45C ( 108 - 113 Fahrenheit) Carbohydrates 65C (149 Fahrenheit) Enzymes 42C - 47C ( 108 – 117 Fahrenheit) Vitamins 50C - 80C ( 122 - 176 Fahrenheit) Fat s not totally destroyed , but change their chemical structure and become toxic carcinogenic substances * For your comparison: water boils at 100C ( 212 Fahrenheit) When you boil or fry somethi ng you should remember about it! WHAT IS THE BEST FOOD FO R OUR DIGESTIVE SYSTEM? What food should we eat to be healthy? Let ’s explore how our digestive system works . It will help us to clarify many things. Most of us think that the digestive system is like a tube. Food comes from one side and passes to the stomach filled with gastri c juice ( hydrochloric acid). And gastric juice dissolves this food. That is, most of us think that we throw in any food and hydrochloric acid dissolves it. This belief is erroneous and contradicts to what has been discovered by the scientists of different countries in the last century. Gastric juice’s main function is not digestive but a protective one. "},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 17 Russian academician A.M. Ugolev discovered that there are two main kinds of digestion: 1) self -digestion , or autolysis , and 2) dissolution by microflor a , that is symbiotic digestion , derived from the word “symbiosis ” (in this case it is symbiosis of microorganism living in our intestine that form our microflora). We’ve chewed and swallowed our food, now it is in our stomach. The main method of digesti on in our stomach is self -digestion (autolysis). To understand what self -digestion means let’s look at the experiment that was performed by academician A.M. Ugolev : there are two vessels, we fill both of them with gastric juice of a predator . After that, we place two frogs in them . One of the frogs is raw, the second one is a boiled one. The result will be very unexpected: the first frog will be fully dissolved, including its bones, but the second one will be changed a little bit on its surface. If gastri c juice could dissolve our food, than the result would be the same, but this did not happen. Let ’s figure out why ? Later Ugolev discovered that under the influence of gastric juice of a predator the cells in the organism of a victim launch the process of self -digestion. Why did a raw frog dissolve ? What did it have that was lacking in the organism of a boiled frog? It turned out that the process of self -digestion was launched by the cells of a victim! It was the organism ’s own enzymes that disassembled th e whole body into simple particles. The process of self - digestion starts with a help of tiny ions of hydrogen that can be found in gastric juice. Living food , that is raw food, dissolves itself in a gastric juice with a help of the food’s own enzymes. All that a predator has to do is to absorb these nutrients in a liquid form. Do we know if the same process of self -digestion is applicable to raw plant foods ? Yes , definitely . All raw vegetable food is full of enzymes that are ready to perform the work of s elf -digestion. Any fruit , seed or nut has a mechanism of processing complex matter into simple components for feeding a sprout. As soon as the seed is placed in appropriate conditions (temperature, humidity) the enzymes start performing their work. The fru it disassemble s itself providing a seed with abundant amount of nutrients for its life. The same happens with vegetable food in our stomach. But it happens much faster than in nature: we grind the food in the mouth and we have ions of hydrogen in the stomach. That is why it takes just a few hours for self -digestion of the raw vegetable food we eat. In this case, of course, it happens not for the benefits of a sprout but for our own benefits. So , now we know the first criteria: the food we eat should possess its own living enzymes, that would perform the work of self -digestion. All enzymes are destroyed by extreme temperatures (thermal treatment) : frying, grilling, boiling, stewing, baking, and so on. Everything that heats the food above 42C (107.6 Fahrenheit ) totally destroys all the enzymes. Thus, the first criteria: our food should be RAW."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 18 Now, let’s move further. After stomach the food goes into small intestine. Here the process of self -digestion continues and simultaneously the nutrients go into the blood flow being absorbed by the walls of the small intestine. All that is left after self -digestion and absorption goes into large intestine. There live our little friends – microorganisms. The microorganisms inhabiting our intestine weight 2,5 kilograms (5.5 lb.) and can be considered as an independent organ. But what is more interesting, these microorganisms are vegans! They eat only vegetable cellulose . Any other food suppresses them. In the world of bacteria it is simple: they multiply twice in their number every 15- 20 minutes. The one who has food has the priority to live. If we feed them with food that is not vegan, than our own friendly microorganisms start starving and die, but the number of putrefactive microbes grows rapidly . Putrefactive microb es eat dead food . The waste products they produce are toxins which are harmful for us. If we eat raw vegetable food , than our native microorganisms thrive. The waste products they produce are vitamins and amino- acids (even indispensable amino acids). The s eries of researches and experiments, conducted by academician A.M. Ugolev proved it. Previously it was believed that there are indispensable amino acid s that can be found only in animal products. It was disproved . There is no such thing as indispensable am ino acid s. But have you heard about it? I would like to ask a question to those scientists that invented the term “ indispensable” amino acid s: how would they explain the fact that big grass -feeding animals like rhinoceros, giraffe, elephant and others manage to gain their weight and grow in height while eating exclusively vegetable food ? A German scientist Ruben published his research explaining what exactly our body gets from animal protein. We eat animal protein. Proteins go into our stomach and then to our intestine . There they are transformed into pectins . When pectins go into our blood they break up into two parts: one that has nitrogen and the other that has no nitrogen in it. The part that carries nitrogen is useless in this particular case. It is disassembled into uriniparous substances and is removed from the body. The second part that does not carry nitrogen gives our body 52- 56% of energy. And this part that carries no nitrogen is called CARBON ! The body has to spend enormous amount of its own energy, resources and time (3 -5 hours) to decompose protein to be able to extract pure carbon. But the same carbon can be easily extracted, and with less efforts, from raw vegetable food. Thus we know there is a second criteria for our food – it should have cellulose and be vegetable. The first criteria : our food should be RAW . The second criteria: our food should be VEGETABLE . When we put them together we get our formula: RAW + VEGETABLE . The upper part of our digestive system needs RAW food, the lower part of it needs vegetable food . "},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 1 9 So, we make a conclusion : Our body needs RAW VEGETABLE food. But what does happen to people that eat cooked food which has no enzymes and no cellulose ? Well, Nature is smart and she foresaw extreme cases. Any living creature in a period of absence of appropriate food can eat unusual food: predators can eat herbs and carrion, grass -feeding animals can eat withered grass and wood. A human can eat boiled meat and preserved foods for a limited period too, but the price f or it is a disease. When animals eat inappropriate food they look weak and sick. The same is applicable to humans. We eat inappropriate food and, as a result, we carry diseases within our bodies. WHY IT IS NOT GOOD TO MIX FOOD Each product has its own unique enzymes, and they are able to process only raw material of the same product. Enzymes of an apple are not suitable for processing raw material of an orange. Enzymes of nuts are not suitable for self - digestion of seeds or cereals and so on. When we mix food the process of digestion slows down. The number of enzymes is smaller than the number of raw material for digestion. When we mix food native enzymes have difficulty to access the raw material they belong to. One more important thing: enzymes can ex ist for a limited period of time, each enzyme has its own life span. Even if they have not completed their task, they decompose and the raw material that is left without their treatment becomes food for putrefactive microbes. Having enough food they grow i n number and shift the balance of our microflora. But when we eat only one kind of food at a time, nativ e enzymes are surrounded by its own raw material and the digestive process becomes more effective. Even traditional medicine tells us that separate nut rition is very healthy. Any living food needs minimum energy of our body for its digestion. That means that the excessive energy can be used for cleansing of the organism and its rejuvenation. When people change their diet to raw vegan diet the body gets a chance to cure it. That is why those people who changed their food to raw vegan food and excluded cooked food from their menu were able to heal cure most of the diseases. So it will be easier for you to understand the work of the enzymes, I’ll give you a simple example: Let’s say you decide to repair your house (or your apartment). You go to a supermarket and buy all the building material s, a service team from the supermarket delivers them and repairs your house for free. Another situation: You go to a s upermarket and buy all the building material s, you deliver everything yourself and spend your time, money and efforts to repair your house. The same difference with raw plan foods vs. cooked food."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 20 WHAT DOES OUR APPENDIX TELL US? Let’s look at the pictur e and find appendix (7,8 y y e e l l l l o o w w). This little part of our body sometimes can cause so many problems to the humanity: 40% of all the surgeries deal with removal of appendix. I’m inviting you to explore what for we need this part of body which for many year s has been considered useless. Studies show that this little appendix is only 10 centimeters long, but it has as many nervous elements as small and large intestine altogether. But contrary to intestine it has massive lymphoid organs, thus serving as imm une and protective organ. Moreover, appendix produces hormones controlling the work of large intestine. Isn’t it too much for an organ considered to be useless ? But that is not all, besides its immune and hormonal functions appendix has one more very inte resting function. It will be more interesting for us because it will lead us to understanding what food we should eat. Appendix is an incubator for our microflora !!! The scientists from the medical school of Duke University (USA) presented results of their research where they came to the conclusion that appendix’s role in the body is to be a kind of a shelter where native microorganisms may hide from external actions in times of unfavorable conditions. What dangers our microorganisms (microflora ) have to hide from ? They hide from what suppresses them. Our native microorganisms hide from alien bacteria and microbes ( putrefactive microbes (one of them is shown on the picture to the right ). the food we eat defines the presence of our or alien microflora. I f we eat raw vegan food, our native microorganisms thrive, producing for us all the vitamins and amino acids. If we eat cooked food or food of animal origin, we enlarge the number of alien microbes that eat dead flesh and produce poisons, intoxicating our body. When it happens , most of our native microorganisms die and those of them who are lucky to survive are hiding in our appendix. We know already that appropriate human food is raw vegetable food. In the times when people could not find raw vegetable cellulose (for example, during cold times or drought times) they had to eat meat or other unnatural food. It was totally suppressing the native microflora of the large intestine. Let’s look at the picture once again: we are interested in small intestine (5 , pink ): the food from small intestine passes to the large intestine (1-4, grey ), it has a special section called blind intestine (6 , green), it is attached to appendix (7,8 , y y e e l l l l o o w w). When cooked food comes into our large intestine the sphincter (valve) b etween blind intestine and large intestine shuts and food passes directly into large intestine, bringing alien microbes and burning out our"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 21 native microorganisms. In such circumstances our native microflora can survive only in blind gut and appendix. Plea se look attentively at the picture: the location of appendix is very useful for the following diffusion of our native microorganisms along large intestine. As soon as the body starts receiving appropriate raw vegan food (after the period of cooked food or meat), the sphincter opens. And our native microorganisms that finally receive their food leave appendix, spread, start growing in number, suppress alien microbes and thrive. And we start receiving appropriate nutrients – vitamins, minerals and amino acids . Why does appendix become inflamed ? In 1902 a French scientist Chonpioneir found out that appendix becomes inflamed due to abundance of meat in the diet. Since childhood many people eat mostly cooked food and intestine treats it like poison. If you keep eating only cooked food with lots of meat, appendix’ protective functions will hypertrophy . Overstress of its lymphoid tissues leads to swelling of appendix. That is why appendix becomes inflamed. Each year 400 people in the United States die from appendic itis . If you want to be healthy be sure your food is mostly RAW VEGAN . OUR FOOD AND OUR HORMONES We have already explored what food is appropriate for humans from physiological point of view. Then we have learnt how our digestive system adjusts to cook ed food in the times when we can not have appropriate food and how it can save our native microflora during such “bad” times. And now we will explore how the food we eat influences our endocrine profile. Let ’s figure out what endocrinal profile is. Horm ones are the transporters, carrying control programs from one organ to others (those programs are like orders what to do, how and when). They were discovered in 1902 by two English scientists Starling and Bayliss. The word “hormone” taking it’s origin from greek «hormao » means to instigate, to stimulate. The organs producing them are called endocrine organs. There are the following endocrine organs in our body: Hypothalamus, Pituitary gland, Thyroid gland, Pancreas, Adrenal glands, Genital glands. Horm ones produced by endocrine organs go into bloodstream and are transported into all parts of our body, but each of them works only in one certain place with a certain organ. Such organ is called a target organ . There is a huge number of different hormones in our body helping to perform all varieties of functions (follicle -stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, testosterone, estradiol,"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 22 progesterone, prolactin and so on). These bioactive substance s participate in all life processes, regulating all processe s like growth of cells or release of gastric juice. Endocrine profile is a balance of the hormones in our body. Our general state depends on the right concentration of hormones . When there is an imbalance we can become whining , hysterical, too impulsive, have obsessive fear s e.t.c.. Imbalance of hormones in the bloodstream can lead to complications and diseases. But what is more interesting , in the 50’ s- 60’ s of the 20 th century the scientists discovered that the whole intestine is an endocrine organ. Acad emician Ugolev proved that gastrointestinal tract is the largest endocrine organ in our body! Previously it was assumed that gastrointestinal tract produced only hormones regulating its own functions (like gastrin, for example), but Ugolev proved that it produces nearly all spectrum of hormones, including steroid hormones, like growth hormone. Endocrine cells of our gastrointestinal tract produce the same hormones as hypothalamus and pituitary gland, and vice versa, the cells of pituitary gland produce g astrin, backing up each other. Thus, due to some hormonal effects we can say that gastrointestinal tract, hypothalamus and pituitary gland systems are relative to each other and interconnected. Even such hormones as endorphins and enkephalins that have been considered to be produced only by our brain, are produced in our intestine . Moreover, our intestine produces 95% of all serotonin the lack of which leads to depressions and severe headaches. Neurophysiologist s and psychologists from UK and the USA disco vered that serotonin can influence our emotions, including behavioral reaction to injustice . The results of their research show that serotonin plays a critical role in decision making, helping to control aggressive reactions. The scientists from Cambridge proved that a change in our diet and stresses make the level of serotonin go up and down, influencing the processes of decision making. The researches conducted in the University of California also proved that lack of serotonin can influence our behavior and make us more aggressive. Some very important amino acids, necessary for production of serotonin we receive only though our food, which means that if we eat inadequate inappropriate food the level of serotonin will be reduced, influencing our ability to control anger and aggression. Sir Robert McCarrison and H.M.Sinclair wrote a book called «Nutrition and Health ». There they reported about the results of their research: when rats are fed with cooked food they start killing each other after two weeks of s uch a diet. Thus , very similar to our society , any occasion can become a reason to start killing each other. The same is happening in a human society . McCarrison ’s experiments show that if people start eating natural raw food , they will stop “eating ” each other, there will be less conflicts, people will become more humane and spiritual. We are what we eat. Our mind, spirituality and health directly depend on what food we eat. The most important part : regulation of hormones’ production in our gastrointest inal tract is different from other endocrine organs. The main difference: the production of hormones depends not only on the general health state but mostly on direct interaction of the food we eat with the walls of our intestine. Some of the hormones can be received though our food only. "},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 23 I want to pay attention to the importance of this conclusion ! Endocrine profile that influences the state of our body, our mood and workability, directly depends on the food we eat. I will give you only one vivid example how our food can influence reproductive ability. Disbalance of hormones is one of the main reasons of infertility among women (up to 40% of cases) and azoospermia (low concentration of sperm cell s in sperm) among men. This example is taken from syromonoed.co m where one raw vegan shares his experience. Within 4 first months of raw vegan diet the concentration of sperm cells in his sperm increased from 4 millions up to 96 millions per 1 milliliter ( it is more than 20 times! ). After that he was able to become a happy father. I repeat it again: our body treats cooked food as poison and mobilized all its resources to neutralize it and eliminate it from our body. As soon as we start eating raw vegetable food that can be self -digest ed and possesses cellulose, our gastrointestinal tract sends corresponding signals to our body. And then , the resources that the body has been spending for protective functions can be released and be used for better purposes. Some of them are : cleansing and healing the body , restoration of a reproductive function , replacement of old tissues, restoration of initial clea rness in the blood vessels. DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAVE BRAIN IN YOUR GUT? I also would like to tell you that nervous system of our int estine has a very complicated organization, in fact it is an independent brain. Michael Gershen, a professor from Columbia University invented such a term as «Gut brain». Gut brain controls all the digestion processes . It continues to function even if it loses all connections with the brain in our head and spine. That gut brain is a highly arranged, complicated and independent system. Before you decide to put something into your mouth ask yourself a question: “Did an ancient man who lived in natural envir onment without any fire and dishes have this food in his possession?” If you do so, the food you eat will be your medicine. We have an option : If we do not eat our food as medicine, we will have to eat medicine as our food. "},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 24 * * * Let ’s sum it up. Our health directly depends on what we eat . I’d like to add that everything discussed above is just a very simplified version. In real life our body is much more complicated than that. The science still knows too little about it. There are lots of other hormones, enzymes, mechanisms of synthesis yet to be discovered. Do not rely upon medications, you need to remember that they were created by people who themselves do not fully understand how the body works. The only doctor that we can trust for sure is Nature. So, eat more fresh and ripe fruits, vegetables, berries, nuts and be healthy! BANISH ALCOHOL FROM YOUR LIFE! Many people think that moderate consumption of alcohol is harmless, and some even believe that it is even good to drink a glass of wine from time to time because it has protective functions for their heart, or they think that drinking a cup of bear is not more harmless than drinking a glass of water. IT’S A LIE! Do you remember that in the sixties it was assumed that smoking 20 cigarettes a day could prevent you from lung cancer? It is not a joke! People were really made to believe it was so! Now it is obvious for everyone that smoking kills. But what about alcohol? For some time it was also believed that in small amounts it is harmless. But updated meta -analysis (54 research works conducted by independent research institutes and laboratories during 1998- 2007) proved that it is wrong! Alcohol kills! The statistics show that alcohol has NO any cardio protective effect, moreover, it is one of the main reasons for cardio- vascular diseases and stenocardia. Alcohol is poison and the statistics show that it also raises the risks of cancer. Even small dosages destroy brain, liver, kidneys, stomach, pancreas, blood, nervous system and other organs of our body. For example, the data received from that meta- analysis shows that even 25 grams of alcohol (ethanol) increase probability of cancer 3 times! Some may still object that alcohol has flavonoids that are healthy for our body. Yes, flavonoids are good for our health, but would you drink a cup of mercury if I would tell you there are a few drops of vitamin C in it? (If you do not know, some centuries ago mercury was considered to be a good remedy to cure diseases!) The same with alcohol and flavonoids. Well, if you are so obsessed with flavonoids, eat fresh grapes, citruses, other fruits, berries – they are abundant in them. And there will be no need for poisoning your precious body. "},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 25 Now I’ll tell you what happens in your body when you make a s ip of an alcohol drink (any alcohol drink!). When you drink alcohol and it enters your body, it goes directly into your blood stream. Do you know that alcohol (ethanol) has an ability to dissolve lipids (fats)? Let’s see what happens in our blood vessel s. Our blood is red due to red blood cells that carry oxygen to all parts of our body. They are tiny little cells and around each red blood cell there is a lipid membrane covering the whole cell, thus a cell can be electrically charged and be separated from other cells. When alcohol enters the bloodstream it instantly dissolves lipid covers of our red blood cells and they begin conglutinat ing (like with a glue). Right away our blood becomes a mess of plaques of these red blood cells glued together (look at the picture to the right!) . And first of all it affects our brain (that’s why when people drink alcohol they feel it their head). And that’s what happens there: The brain is the most complicated organ in our body made of brain cells. The body utilized nearly half of its energy to maintain the proper function of our brain. Every cell of the brain is fed by very thin blood vessels called microcapilla ries. They are so thin and narrow that only one or two red blood cells delivering oxygen to a brain cell can go through and supply it. But what happens when such plaques come to the brain’s micro capilla ries? They block them and hundred thousands of your brain cells die in a few minutes due to the lack of oxygen. They rot and decompose. To remove this graveyard f rom your brain the body pumps in liquids into it and washes the dead brain cells away. Later they are removed with your urine. So, next time you’ll have an opportunity to make a sip of alcohol you will remember what I have told you. Otherwise you’ll have t o flush your poor brain cells into your toilet bowel each time you drink alcohol. There is another important thing you should know about red blood cells glued together. When such a plaque comes to a place of connections of different blood vessels it gets stuck there and the blood can not go through the vessels freely. In this case the pressure within the vessel raises, it bulges and can burst. Of course it is not all that makes alcohol so dangerous and poisonous. There are a few people who know that alcohol also has another very destructive substance called tetrahydroisoquinoline. It is more strong than morphine. It is the same substance that is produced during consumption of heroine and that is why it also addictive. As opposed to ethanol, it has a v ery unpleasant property: it is nearly impossible to eliminate it from the body. Each time you make a tiny sip of alcohol, be sure this destructive substance is accumulating in the brain and the amount of it is increasing gradually during one’s lifespan. The laboratory tests proved that even after 7 years of taking no alcohol at all, the amount of tetrahydroisoquinoline in the brain was nearly the same and even after 25 years of taking no alcohol at all, the traces of that destructive substance were still there. "},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 26 Besides, ethanol and tetrahydroisoquinoline alcohol includes other poisonous substances like fusel oil s and other chemical impurity substances that are of no use of improving your health. There are other very scary complications caused by alcohol, but I’m not going to write about them here right now. There is a very small amount of alcohol produced by our body (less than 1- 2 mg. a day) for its own metabolic needs. This alcohol is called endogenous and it is not destructive because it works exactly i n those places where it is needed. When the work is done the body produces another substance alcohol dehydrogenase that neutralizes our endogenous alcohol. The body can not produce enough alcohol dehydrogenase to neutralize even a small amount of alcohol o ne may drink. So, as you can see, there is no need to poison your own body with alcohol drinks. Alcohol is a violent poison! Eliminate alcohol from your life and you will be able to restore your health! HOW MUCH FOOD DO WE ACTUALLY NEED? Here I’ ll briefly tell you about a series of experiments performed by Galina Shatalova (her name has been already mentioned earlier). This is an excerpt from her book: “Super marathoners ran 500 kilometers (311 miles) during 7 days, covering 70- 72 kilometers (14.5 -15 miles) per day. In average, super marathoners spend 6000 calories a day. The essence of the experiment was the following: The group of 40 super marathoners consisted of two different groups. The first one were ordinary super marathoners, the second one included the people who were trained according to my method. The first group consumed the food according to the diet prescriptions made for them by the specialists of sports medicine. Each day they consumed approximately 190 grams of protein, 200 gram s of fat and 900 grams of carbohydrates. In terms of calories it was 6000 calories. Their set of food corresponded to traditional views of “theorists” from medicine and included the following: meat, pasta, cookies, sweets. The athletes from my group (the second group) were receiving 28 grams of protein, 25 grams of fat, 180 grams of carbohydrates that corresponded to 1200 calories. The set of food included raw natural fresh organic vegan food: herbs, fruits, vegetables, whole seeds. Physical load and day regimen were the same for both groups. After the experiment a comparative analysis conducted by the specialists from the Physical Culture Academy showed that my group showed better results, their level of endurance was higher, they did not loose any body weight, in opposite, they gained weight. "},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 27 The next time there was a following experiment: It was a four day run from Academgorodok to Barnaul. There were 13 participants, all of them were not professionals but amateurs of running from Siberian Academy of Science. They were running 50 kilometers (31 miles) a day. Each day, before and after the distance all the participants were weighted on scales with an accuracy of 50 grams. At the end three participants had the same weight, four participants gained 0,7 to 2 kilograms (1.55 – 4.4 lb.) of weight. For comparison, marathoners, who eat tra ditionally, lo se 3 -4 kilograms (6.6 – 8.8 lb.) of weight during a competition. Even more shocking results were received after four other experiments that I arranged. It was hikes across Central Asiatic deserts. I myself and the participants who followed me were consuming not more than 600 calories a day. Yet, while crossing the desert we were covering the distance of 30- 35 kilometers (18.6 – 21.8 miles) a day. There is an erroneous opinion that perspiration moistens the surface of skin causing it to cool off upon evaporation. But I’m a doctor myself and I know that when water comes into our organism, it does not go directly to the pores of our skin, instead, it has to go though a very complicated process of transformation, which also takes a huge amount of the body energy. That is why excessive water intake makes the body weaker and what is even worse, it overheats it. There we 11 participants in that experiment. All of them had been trained according to my system of natural health improvement and totally changed their diet to raw vegan. Our group had to hike from Aralsk to Karateren. The distance between those two settlements is 125 kilometers (78 miles). We were planning to cover this distance in 7 days, but we were able to cover it in 5 days. My age was 70 years old at that time. During the experiment we were able to minimize the water intake up to 10 times. That is, while crossing the desert we were drinking only 1 liter (0.26 gal.) a day. First of all, it was possible because the participants consumed food with exceptionally low content of protein, low in calories, and strictly vegan (if you have not known, for any food made out of living creatures it takes 42 grams of water to digest 1 gram of their protein). Secondly, we were drinking structured (spring) water only. We just added a little bit of herbs in it. Those herbs were needed to help the body to lower its temperature. When you are in a desert, don’t drink regular cold water. After that the organism will be very thirsty. We figured out, that it is enough to put a small pebble or a raisin into your mouth to eliminate thirst. When you put them into your mouth, there starts the process of salivation. And your saliv a is a structured water that helps the body to cool off and eliminate thirst. The same effect gives you warm water with herbs. All these little tricks let us lower the water intake to 1 liter (0.26 gal) a day without any harm to our health. In opposite, it helped to make the process of thermoregulation more effective. The results of my experiments spread widely across the borders of this country. Very soon I received an offer from Czechoslovakia, they asked me to conduct similar experiments with their tea m of athletes. So, in 1988 we arranged another expedition. There were 12 people: five of my disciples that live according to the system of natural health improvement, me myself, five well trained athletes from Czechoslovakia and their"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 28 interpreter. Our group, in comparison to theirs was less prepared, yet no one from our team left the distance during the experiment. But three athletes from another team left their group already after 2 days of our hike. The rest of them, including the interpreter were able t o cover 134 kilometers (83.3 miles) together with our team and after that they were totally exhausted. And it was of no surprise: they kept to a high- calorie diet with lots of animal protein and had to drink not less than 10 liters (2.65 gal) a day. Their appearance was extremely emaciated. The members of our team looked wonderfully; their mood and their health were so good that they decided to cover the rest of the path. After taking our exhausted international friends back to civilization we continued t he hike and covered another 272 kilometers (169 miles). After that I made a summary report to the Physical Culture Research Institute, reporting about all the conducted experiments and studies performed in 1983- 1989. The results impressed them so much that I received a grant to arrange the final large- scale experiment. Due to the funding I could involve seven of my patients to participate in that final experiment. All of them had been my patients; all of them had been healed after changing their lives according to the principles of my system of natural health improvement. Before they were healed they had the following diseases: insulin- dependent diabetes, chronic hypertension, duodenal ulcer, acute pyelonephritis, liver cirrhosis, impaired cardial funct ion. And there also was one lady who defeated her breast cancer. Prior to the experiment all of the candidates’ health was thoroughly examined in the Physical Culture Research Institute and after that they were approved to participate in a 500 kilometers ( 311 miles) hike across the sands of the Central Kara- Kum desert. Our itinerary was: Baharden - Kurtamysh Natural Reserve. We began our hike after 10 days of preparations. There were no roads, so we had to walk across the deser t, stepping on red- hot sand, its temperature was up to 50° С (122 Fahrenheit). Nevertheless, it was an easy hike and we enjoyed the beauty of nature. We ate once a day, we drank green tea, sometimes adding honey or raisins into it – they have a peculiarity to cool off the skin. The water intake was the same, as us ual – not more than 1 liter (0.26 gal) a day. First of all we planned to cover the distance in 20 days, but it was so easy for us that we covered it within 16 days. At finish we felt just wonderful. We managed to maintain our bodies’ weight and even gain some. All those results were achieved with minimum amount of water and food intake.

It has been proven by the life experience that active healthy way of life, raw food diet and a minimum food intake (that are essential in my system that I’ve been practicing myself for more than 50 years), work perfectly well. The people who follow my recommendations can reduce the load and st ress for their bodies and organs up to 5- 15 times. This will miraculously improve their health! I’ve seen it many times in many cases in my life while practicing the system of natural health improvement. I bet you’ll agree with me that it is quite a hard t ask to walk 500 kilometers (311 miles) across the roasting sands of a desert. It would be hard even for men who are young healthy and strong. And I already was 74 years old when I crossed that desert!” For reference: Galina Shatalova , born 1916, is a neur osurgeon, MD, PhD; clinical researcher and Burdenko Award prize winner. She was head of the medical selection- committee in charge of screening soviet cosmonauts. In 1960 she began developing her system of natural health improvement. To prove her theories she and her patients undertook many hikes through desert in 1983- 1990. She is an author of many books. Her book “The choice of the way” (1996), describes her system. She claims that the requirements of food are around 250 to 400 kcal, assuming a natural r aw diet rather than processed diet. The four elements of her system of natural health improvement are: - Correct breathing - Healthy motion - Hardening of the organism (cold showers, walking on snow barefooted e.t.c.) - Appropriate nutrition Her personal site: www.shatalova.ru The source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galina_Shatalova BEGINNING THE ULTIMATE BALANCING ACT If raw plant foods are going to take pride of place in your diet, you're probably wondering where to start, how to keep variety in your diet and how to make it easy.

And why actually people need to cook and what do they cook ? They cook meat , cereals, vegetables to improve the taste. Why does it happen? In wild nature we will never see something like that? All leaving creatures living in natural environment eat what the nat ure gives them, not trying to improve their food. They simply have no need to improve something that is already good and tasty. Carnivoras eat raw flesh , herbivorous animal s eat fresh grass , frugivorous creatures eat ripe fruits. There are no living creat ures that could not eat the food destined for them in natural form. When a human initially takes the food that is not suitable for her/him, she/he has nothing to do but to make it edible and eatable somehow. If she/he takes the food that is suitable, ther e is no need to cook it. In both cases the food we eat is taken from nature. But a human is not at all happy with the food she/he takes from nature . Maybe we just take something inappropriate ? Lets take pigs for example, they will eat natural raw potatoes with pleasure. But wolfs are not interested in potatoes at all. Nature has taken care about each creature in a proper way. For each creature there is appropriate, ready to eat food. And all that food is alive . But a human does not notice it. She /he’ d rather take living food, cook it, converting living food into the dead one. Thus, he/ she performs two very strange actions: he cooks what is already ready for consumption and he/she transforms living food into dead food. It is not clear how it is poss ible to make already good for eating food better while killing it with cooking, or mixing different kinds of food together. For each creature food serves better when consumed separately. That’s what we do: we take a vegetable marrow , cut it in slices, cl eanse from inside, rub its pulp with salt, add some cream or cheese, sprinkle with slices of mushrooms, put all this stuff into oven for 40 minutes and only after that we would eat it. It is hard to understand how something dead can nourish a living body and supply it with necessary life power. We put into oven some tasteless food and after some time we open the oven and expect to take out something tasty. And if we do not like the taste of it, we’ll try to add something else. And we never even bother to think what huge transformations happen with this food in the oven. But we need to figure out what actually happens to this food after cooking. Let ’s look at nature : when a ripe fruit stays under sun rays, it starts decomposing very fast."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 31 If its decompo sition under the sun goes relatively slow, we can not say the same about cooking. During the cooking process the temperature is much higher and any living food is destroyed in an instance. All enzymes , vitamins , protein etc . are totally destroyed during cooking. The minerals, even if they are not destroyed can not be digested without vital vitamins and enzymes. Fat transforms into carcinogen substance and our body has to deal with all these dangerous waste products. The longer the food is exposed to extreme temperatures (heat or frost), the less edible and more poisonous it becomes. Thus , with fire, hot and boiling water or frost everything what is alive becomes dead. So far, we have been discussing what is edible and not edible. Let’s focus on what is healthy. Not everything that is edible is equally beneficial and healthy . Healthy food is the food suitable for the body. All creatures in nature have different bodies. How do all these creatures know what nature gives them for food? If nature gives something, she also provides creatures with every tool, so they would be able to take what the nature gives. A wolf and a tiger have sharp canine teeth and claws that help them to get their food. A pig has a snout and hooves to get its food . Let’s imagine we put a piece of meat and a few potatoes in front of a fox. What would the fox prefer to choose? Of course it depends on a fox. But let’s agree we consider a normal healthy fox, living in wild. For sure the fox will choose meat: its look, smell and taste are mor e attractive for it . But what if we would give that animal an intellect , would keep it in not natural conditions and would feed it with potatoes instead of meat? Probably the animal would be confused if we would offer it to choose between meat and potatoes . Potatoes would look more familiar, even the smell and the taste would be more familiar. But if this fox would try to eat meat and potatoes, the taste would suggest it what is preferable. A human , who used to living separately from nature is placed in the similar position like that confused fox. But a human has its own tools that help her/him to choose the appropriate food. It is: nose, eyes, hands and mouth with a tongue . By means of these tools a human is able to recognize the food that the nature has designed and destined for her/him . For that a human has to start using her/his senses properly. WHAT FOODS DO WE LIKE IN A NATURAL FORM ? Maybe it is meat ? Try to bite off a piece of flesh from a pig or a cow . Even if you will succeed it will be pretty hard to chew it, but it will be even harder to find pleasure in this activity. The smell, the look of flesh is disgusting for humans, yet can be very attractive for predators. Though it does not mean that we are not capable of eating meat. It is possi ble , but is it healthy? "},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 32 It is very uncomfortable and complicated for a human to eat meat in a natural form, like in nature . For all predators meat is attractive in a natural form . It is not a coincidence . For each creature there is its own food . And its r eady for consumption in a natural (raw) form . That is why we will hardly find so many diseases among wild creatures, that are so common among civilized society where people not only cook and destroy their food, but consume even the food inappropriate for humans. What does an ordinary person thinks when she/he hears the word “meat”? Probably she /he hardly thinks of raw meat . It takes long to cook meet , and most of the nutrients are killed by the temperature higher than 38- 45C. So , finally , after cooking we have dead meat with a modified structure. And even after that its taste is not attractive to us. That is why we use taste boosters such as salt, spice s and others supplements. Due to the lack of taste we start mixing one kind of food with others. Now we know that meat in its natural form is not pleasant for humans, it means that it is not destined to be consumed by humans. Let’s look at cereals . This food is very popular in our society too. Wheat ripens in an ear of wheat. Each granule is covered wi th a coating. It is hard for a human to take granules out of the ear of wheat and peel them, releasing from the coating. The size of the granules is very small, that’s why the human will have to collect, take out and peel a huge number of granules. Otherwi se she/ he will stay hungry. It is doubtful that after hours of such work she/he will be satisfied with the taste of this meal. The granules have pretty insipid taste . Consider a bird . It is, in opposite can perform this work pretty easy and fast because it has all the tools: a handy beak, small body and stomach. The taste of the granules is very attractive to it. We see , that in natural form small granules of wheat or other cereals can not be attractive for humans. What about vegetables? A human can dig out potatoes , but very soon it will be obvious that the look , the smell and the taste of it is not very attractive too. But a pig can perform this work better . The pig ’s body is more suited to extract , digest and enjoy the taste of potatoes. Though the vegetables are not very suitable for humans too, it is obvious, there are some of them that are more or less suitable. For example, cabbages , carrots or cucumbers can be eatable. But anyway, in most cases we add them to our salads and rarely eat them in natural raw form. The less food is suitable for eating, the harder it is to eat it without mixing or cooking. So far we have not found our human food, but at least we know what I S NOT our food. Right from birth nature gives us wonderful tools so we will b e able to define food which is suitable for us. We can taste , smell , see the color and sense the form ."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 33 It is enough to understand whether the food is suitable for us or not. We can easily find such food if we keep in mind only one rule: we should not change the food taken from nature. . REAL FRUITS Ripe real fruits are very attractive for a human from any perspective: their aroma, form, color and taste. Our senses can recognize whether they like it or not without doubt. Our senses help us to find the foo d suitable for us. The food suitable for all senses is suitable for the body too. Simple as that . What about good tomatoes ? They are real fruits . The taste of ripe tomatoes is very rich, the color as attractive, the form and the smell are pleasant too. Cucumbers can be considered vegetables, their taste is slightly noticeable, moreover , the cucumbers that we eat are unripe. If you saw ripe cucumbers you know that they are sour and their taste is unpleasant. TASTE Nature gives us wonderful tools to le ad a life of full value. But not every human has learnt how to use them wisely. One of the most important tools is our taste. To use our taste wisely means to be attentive to it. The fruits of different plants are different in their taste. Even one kind of fruits suitable for humans that has been grown in good conditions (organic, enough sun, water, fresh air, good soil etc) is enough to saturate one’s own taste. This kind of fruit is of full value because it has a variety of shades of taste in itself. It can be compared to a good song . If we are playing two or more songs simultaneously we can enjoy none of them. If a fruit grew in bad conditions we have a natural desire to improve its taste, mix it with something else to meet a lack of good taste – to salt it, add sugar or pepper or mix it with other fruits. Though the food will not be killed if we mix it, nevertheless it will not be fully digested because for each kind of living food our body creates individual conditions in our digestive system. And w hen we eat several foods at one at the same time our digestive system is puzzled and has no idea what ferments to produce to digest this mix. The body will have to work at its highest capacity, which is not very healthy. Moreover , if we eat several kinds o f food at once they will conflict each other in our digestive system, which will make the process of digestion very complicated, ineffective and sometimes even impossible. For example, if we mix tomatoes with pineapples, it’s very probable that we will ha ve gastric indigestion. If we will mix tomatoes with cucumbers we will face gastric indigestion as well, but not so noticeable. Anyway, gastric indigestion of any kind has nothing in common with our good health."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 34 When we play two songs simultaneously, all we will hear will be disharmony and cacophony . The more life there is in our food, the better the food is for living humans. Only a living food can nourish and protect a living body. SUITABLE FOOD Suitable food is living food s. Because living foods give life. Dead food is an inappropriate food, it is an obstacle for life in our bodies. Nature produces suitable food not only for other creatures, but for humans as well. Suitable natural raw food tunes our human bodies to live in harmony with nature. Less suitable food varies in quality: - vegetables , mushrooms, nuts, herbs – they are also living food and can be useful for the body. The choice of food depends on our consciousness. Our consciousness is based on our knowledge about the world around us . The more accurate the knowledge is, the better consciousness can serve us. Until our consciousness receives inappropriate food, the body will have to eat inappropriate food and suffer. The body is fed with food, the consciousness is fed by thoughts. The right healthy thoughts for our consciousness is the same as suitable food for our body. Nature is wise and generous. We can take her gifts wisely or can refuse taking them. Any choice influences human’s inner nature. And after that is reflected outsid e. The hospitals that exist in our cities and the disposal tips that exist outside our cities are manifestations of one and the same misunderstanding and lack of knowledge. It is enough to look at how widely is spread our medicine and how far the quality of our food fell behind.

There is no healing without elimination of toxins from your body. In this chapter we’ll explore in details how to effectively get rid of them. IS YOUR BODY A FILTER FOR WASTE, POLLUTION AND TOXICITY? LEARN HOW TO STOP THE ROT “Health is as infectious as disease, given the right conditions for its spread” (Dr. George Scott Williamson, 1943) Whenever waste m atter passes out of your body via your skin, bowels, urine, breath etc. you are ridding your body of waste. This is the natural process of detoxification and it is happening every minute of every day, by embracing it, you'll begin to eliminate waste faster and set the stage for exuberant health. Every natural process in your body is designed to preserve life. If you don't assist the detoxification process on a regular basis, you'll never eliminate the obstructions that can eventually lead to your demise. BEGIN RESTRUCTURING YOUR BODY TODAY! Today you have the opportunity to make a very important decision. Over the course of the next two years, 98% of the atoms in your body will be completely replaced. Over the course of the next seven years, 100% of your body will be replaced. What does this mean? With a powerful vision and the love of creation, you can literally rebuild a new you. You are constantly recreating yourself out of the food you eat, the air you breathe and the water you drink. If you make the decision to embrace detoxification and completely clear your body of ALL unwanted waste, it'll be one of the most rewarding journeys you'll ever take. Ultimately you'll have the joy of knowing that every cell and atom in your body is crackling with energy and built from something alive and vibrant. Whether you're in your teens or about to reach 100, it's never too late to regenerate."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 36 THE TUBES OF DETOXIFICATION The best way to think of detoxification, intoxication and digestion is to imagine that your body consists of three layers of 'tubes'. 1. The first tube is your digestive system or alimentary canal. It runs from your mouth to your anus and consists of the mouth, oesophagus, stomach, intestines, and colon. Each of these organs help to break down and assimilate foods. As you'll soon discover, when this tube is obstructed by a substance called mucoid plaque it can lead to a whole host of problems. 2. The second tube is your circulatory system and it draws in whatever is present in the first tube. If you've just ingested hemp seeds for example, the chlorophyll, enzymes, amino acids, vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals and trace elements will enter your bloodstream ready to create amazing health. If you've eaten a meal of cooked meat and pasteurised milk, your bloodstream will draw in those elements and your blood will thicken and slow down. This second tube consists of arteries, veins, capillaries, and the heart. 3. The third tube is the lymphatic system. It's the lymph fluid that bathes every cell, orga n, muscle and tissue drawing nutrients (and waste) from the bloodstream before delivering them to the cells. If the bloodstream is full of powerful nutrients, the cells will get a good feed. If the bloodstream is full of the waste, the cells will be poorly nourished. The lymphatic system also returns the waste products of cell metabolism back to the blood and back to the intestines. Did you know that you have four times as much lymph in your body as you do blood? The lymphatics also hold 80% of your body's antioxidant capacity, necessary for the fight against free radicals. The liver is also filled with lymphatics, highlighting the importance of keeping this tube flowing freely and unobstructed. When you create a free flowing bloodstream, the lymph fluid can mobilize any waste that may have built up around the cells and eliminate it. Now that you are aware of the three tubes of detoxification, you need to know what can be done to bring each 'tube' back to perfect functioning. Let's begin with the Tube 1 - Yo ur digestive system or alimentary canal .  "},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 37 TUBE 1 – YOUR DIGESTIVE SYSTEM A PICTURE OF IMPERFECT HEALTH EMERGES FROM INSIDE Take a look at the following picture. If you knew that deep within your body, coating your alimentary canal (f rom your tongue to your anus) there was a thick, rubbery, slimy mucus layer that was preventing you from getting the MAXIMUM nutrition from food — would you want to get it out? What if this foul smelling layer was harbouring parasites, preventing nutrient absorption and basically robbing you of life - would you be motivated to rid your body of this hazardous material? SO WHAT IS THIS THICK RUBBERY MUCUS AND WHY IS IT SO DANGEROUS TO OPTIMAL HEALTH? If you've spent a lifetime eating an acidifying diet, full of meat, dairy, sugar, bread, wheat, fried food, fizzy drink etc. with very little nutrient rich food, your body will have responded by creating an internal shield to help prevent the devastating effect of the excess acidity. This shield consists of muc in, a glycoprotein mucus secreted by your intestinal glands. It lines the intestines in an effort to protect you from acids and other irritants. If this situation persists, layers of mucus build up until they form mucoid plaque. This plaque is so insidious it prevents normal digestion and assimilation NO MATTER HOW GOOD YOUR DIET IS! It harbours toxicity, causes your bowels to lose efficiency and destroys the balance of healthy bacteria in your gut, opening the door to bowel disease, the forerunner to almos t ALL diseases of modern civilization . "},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 38 TAKING A STRANGLE HOLD ON YOUR HEALTH Mucin, mucoid, glycoprotein or mucoprotein - call it what you will, is strangling the health out of millions of people, and maybe you are one of them. You may not notice it now, but once you expel it from your body, the mere experience of not having it will be so powerful; you'll want to shout it from the rooftops. In his book Tissue cleansing through bowel management, Dr Bernard Jensen D.C., N.D., Ph.D. shares a powerful exam ple of how insidious mucoid plaque can be, \"One autopsy revealed a colon to be 9 inches in diameter with a passage through it no larger than a pencil. The rest was caked up layer upon layer of encrusted faecal material. This accumulation can have the cons istency of truck -tire rubber. It's that hard and black. Another autopsy revealed a stagnant colon to weigh in at an incredible 40 pounds. Imagine carrying around all that morbid accumulated waste.\" If you are highly motivated to improve your health, focus on eliminating the mucoid plaque. A healthy colon should only weigh between 4 and 6 pounds -not 40! ONLY WHEN YOU EXPEL THIS THICK RUBBERY, FOUL SMELLING MUCUS FROM YOUR BODY CAN YOU EXPERIENCE THE JOY OF AGGRESSIVE HEALTH Do you know what happens to m ucoid plaque if it isn't dealt with? It gets thicker, harder and more toxic. Before long it becomes the home for a whole host of pathogenic micro organisms and parasites. How can any attempt be made to regain health if this filth isn't removed? AGGRESSIVE HEALTH CANNOT BE ACHIEVED UNLESS YOU RID YOUR BODY OF MUCOID PLAQUE Whether you're reading this because you feel sick and are worried about your future or if you consider yourself in good health - until you rid your body of mucoid plaque your attempts to accelerate down the path to explosive health may be compromised. Don't get me wrong, you can still make incredible progress, but talking from personal experience, the difference before and after doing the cleanse is like night and day. Every disease know n to man can be traced to a foul putrefying internal state. Clean tube No. 1 and you march towards AGGRESSIVE HEALTH with CERTAINTY! RIDDING YOURSELF OF MUCOID PLAQUE ONCE AND FOR ALL THE BIG QUESTION : How do you eliminate mucoid plaque? ANSWER : By embr acing a 9 day cleanse program designed specifically to soften the plaque and expel it from your body. Even after years of eating a high raw diet I still managed to expel length after length of foul smelling, rubbery mucoid during this cleanse. Take a look at those pictures again. I took these pictures 2,5 weeks into the cleanse once the mucoid plaque started to exit my body. Let me tell you - it had an odour like burn t rubber mixed with the smell of an old peoples home. Get it out! "},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 39 After seeing this it beg s the question. How can ANY diet be truly successful if mucoid plaque remains stuck to the alimentary canal preventing the maximum absorption of nutrients? Many experts have suggested that nothing is able to get this rid of this foul smelling waste other t han a highly sophisticated program designed to soften the plaque and expel it.

When you clean the first tube via a herbal cleanse and eliminate mucoid plaque you set the stage for perpetual health. CREATE A HARMONIOUS ENVIRONMENT WHERE PARASITES DON'T WANT TO LIVE There is a lot of talk about parasites in today's society, but without mucoid plaque to 'get their teeth into' they can't even get a foot hold in a strong powerful body. Imagine layers of sticky, slimy faeces attaching itself to your intestinal tract, building up into a tough, rubbery foul smelling substance. In the same way that mosquitoes love a stagnant pond environment, parasites love a stagnant mucoid covered environment to live and feed on. Again, it's not a parasite problem as much as it is a problem with the internal terrain and internal pollution. Parasites protect themselves by burying inside or under the layers of filth and remain there until the mucoid plaque is eliminated. Once it has, you can then focus on restoring optimal bowel pH and create a healthy environment for the good bacteria. Simple. Anyone who disagrees hasn't had the experience of this 'stuff being eliminated. "},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 40 WASHING YOUR INTESTINE Another way to cleanse intestine is to irrigate it. There are two ways to wash intestine. The first one is with enemas (irrigation of the colon), the second one is called Shankh Prakshalana (irrigation o f the whole gastrointestinal tract ). If you are not experienced in it, find more information about it, here I’ll cover just the basics. It is really worth to wash with water the large intestine during fasting. Also during dry fasting the intestine can be washed, although this makes the fasting less efficient, because water is delivered to the body. The large intestine is the place, from which different substances are being absorbed into the body, including all toxins oozed by putrefying mixtures. Everything is directly absorbed by the blood and then circulates through the whole body. Some people think with disgust about the enema. If you belong to them, know that when it is not washed it contains putrefying matter. The poisoning toxins produced by the putrefying intestine content are entering the blood. Then they circulate throughout the whole body, causing unpleasant reactions and additionally overloading the excreting system. Not excreted matter of the large intestine remains in it as fecalith, which m ay be the cause of diseases including intestine cancer (one of the most often death reasons in Europe and America). So it is up to you to decide, what you prefer, to see the dirt flowing out of your body or you prefer to putrefy inside. The large intestine is a tube 60 to 80 cm long (2-2.6 ft.) , with many nooks, so it needs many deep washings in order to be well cleaned. It is enough to use clean water for washing the large intestine. On the internal side of the large intestine something similar to gum lik e mucus is being accumulated for years. It may be difficult to wholly remove it. In some case fasting for a few weeks, with enemas, is needed. Then it gradually tears off and flows out. If you are plan ning complete dry fasting, wash the intestine well bef ore starting. During complete dry fasting no enema is done in order not to give any water to the body. Therefore, in order not to suffer, it is worth to do water fasting for a week (doing deep enema every day) and then start the dry fasting. Wash the intes tine once a day during the first week of fasting, every second day during the second week of fasting and later twice a week. When only clean water will be flowing from the intestine even thou you wash it deeply, you can decrease the incidence to only one enema a week. The large intestine washing by itself (even without any fasting) is an efficient cure, which in many cases removes the cause of illnesses. Most people have no idea what can be accumulated in the intestine. Remains of eaten food may stay in th e intestine for tens of years, in form of fecalith and gum like mucus glued to the sides. These remains are one of main causes forming intestine tumors. The internal side of the large intestine is covered with villi, thanks to which the absorbing process can run smoothly enough. During the passing years of life mucus -and -gum like substance precipitate on the villi. Other substances of difficult to assay composition stick to it. Gradually something looking like gum -insulation is being formed, which makes th e proper absorbing of the nutrients into the blood difficult or impossible."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 41 Besides, this layer is a friendly environment for many bad bacteria, fungus, mold and other parasites. Proliferating colonies of these parasites and their excrements damage the bacterial flora (necessary for the intestine proper work), poison the blood and, as a result, the whole body. This is how originate a favorable basis for many illnesses of which suffer more and more representatives of the terrestrial civilization, and which grows like an epidemic (e.g. cancer, allergy, diabetes). The doctors applying hydrocolonotherapy say that a matter can be washed out from the large intestine, which is a residue from what the person ate years ago. This happens because the layer of mucus a nd fecalith grows thicker with the course of time, if the diet is not right. This layer constrict the diameter of the large intestine and gradually makes it impossible for the body to absorb anything except products of the putrefying matter. Then the liver becomes intoxicated so much that it is unable to neutralize all of toxins. Such a person is under the influence of poisons all the time. This can be clearly seen on the face and the whole skin. Illnesses happening often, feeling of tiredness, headaches, faster aging of the skin, dim or even yellow eyes are all symptoms clearly indicating poisoned body, with the origin coming from the large intestine. Cleaning the internal side of the intestine brings back its proper functions, which in turn makes the body healthy. When one stops eating the intestine first slows down and then stops working. Remains of the digested food remain in intestine, it also is the case with the mucus -and -gum like substance on the side and the fecalith. New matter does not flow into the intestine, so the old one is not moved out. The matter remaining in the large intestine changes into hard lumps, which presence in there isn't beneficial for the body, for sure. It may be a nest of parasites. The remaining matter and the mucus gluing the villi in the large intestine can be washed out with water — a simple and efficient method. This in many cases brings back health or even saves the life of a person (whose body had toxins, tumor, parasites). That's why flushing the intestine with water may be so important. For sure it can be said, enema is life saving. In case of many illnesses deep, well done washing of the large intestine is enough to remove the cause of the illness and heal the person. From the day that you stop eating (during fasti ng) , wash the large intestine at least once a week (it depends on how you feel during the fasting) . Every person decides for him/herself about the frequency of the enemas, which suits him/her. A good procedure is to rinse the intestine once a day in the fi rst week of fasting, once in two days in the second week, and twice a week later. The intestine is washed with water until it is completely clean inside. This may take from a week to a few weeks , depending on the skill of the particular person. Especially the gum -like mucus needs a lot of work because it tears slowly and resistantly (we have already discussed a more natural way to remove the mucoid plaque with herbs) . Usually many rinses are needed in order to fully clean the internal side of the large inte stine. Complete purity of the intestine, from the anus until the point where the large intestine connects with the appendix, needs exercising and enemas repeated many times. "},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 42 WASHING YOUR COLON People constructed apparatuses which helps to wash the whole large intestine. There are efficient and usable ones among them. However if you want to be independent from any apparatuses, you can learn to do ordinary enemas . Doing frequent washing of the intestine will work out the best method for you. You can modify and apply in any way that suits you the advices written here. At the beginning you can imagine that the large intestine is a pleated and very curved tube, like the one of a vacuum cleaner, and has the form of the U letter put upside- down. So ask y ourself: What should I do to wash out the contents of this tube? What to do with the water and the body? What kind of movements and positions of the body to do in order to wash out, with water, the whole tube from the beginning to the end? The large intest ine is washed with water at the temperature from about 59 Fahrenheit to 113 Fahrenheit , although some specialists advice even hotter. Try first hot and then cold enema in one sitting, do it alternatively. The water is poured in from a few to more than a dozen times. Pour in as much water as you can hold, but do not exaggerate. The slower you pour in the water, with breaks, the more can hold inside. More water poured in washes better and deeper. Of course, do not exaggerate because the intestine is not a balloon. From a half to two liters (0.53 gal.) of water can go in (some people can hold more) in one enema. When the water is inside, do some movements. When you keep in mind that the large intestine is like a U- tube put upside- down, you can easily work out helpful positions and movements. For example, you can pull the belly in and out, shake it to the sides or down and up, massage it. You can also raise your heels and immediately let them down hitting the floor (shaking the belly). After the time from a few seconds to a few minutes of these movements and positions, push all the contents out. Your imagination can help also in case of this activity. For example, in order to pull out all the water from the ascending part of the intestine (on the right), you can put the feet on the wall and then rise the belly up, even up to the vertical position. In this position pull the belly in and out a few times. Then turn on the left site and move the feet down. From this lying position (on the left), at the same time rise the buttocks and pull in the belly, but keep the head down. Then squat and throw out the intestine contents as much as possible. Repeat the procedure as many times as needed, so that all the water will flow out (2 to 5 times). Then you can, again, pour in water and repeat it all. To master the described method of intestine flushing, one needs to exercise. This is an efficient method for cleaning the intestine's sides, removing the fecalith and bringing back the right functions of the intestine. Some people wash the intestine with herbal infusions, coffee, water with lemon juice or other liquids. This may be a good idea in some cases, especially when you want to give the body a painkiller (caffeine), a medicine (herbs), a substance softening the gum -like mucus. In the past a soap solution was used, but this is not a good idea as it irritates the"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 43 intestine and pois ons the body. According the principle, that the simplest solutions are the most efficient ones, most often the ordinary water is enough. If you intend to make a dry fast, first carefully wash the intestine. Start the washing at least a week before you stop drinking — this period is a fast on water only. Before you stop drinking, the large intestine must be clean inside. Thanks to this it is much e asier to live without water, because the body needs it much less, comparing with the time when the body is removing toxins (which entered the body from the intestine). On the second or third day of fasting you may want to cause diarrhea. For this purpose one eats herbal or non- toxic chemical laxative. One of them is magnesium sulphate (Epsom salts, about 25 grams) (but read carefully about its side effects!) . Also 100% pear juice (about 1 liter (0.26 gal.) bought in a store or produced by yourself) works well. It is worth to remember that many people have abdominal pain after drinking large amount of a pear juice. This can be quite painful, depends on how long the person has been fasting before drinking the juice and what is remaining in the intestine. Af ter drinking the juice, strong spasms and peristaltic movements occur in the intestine. If the intestine was not clogged too much, the diarrhea will come within several minutes. You can warm up about one liter (0.26 gal.) of pear juice. Then drink it all within or less than five minutes, but not too fast so that you do not cause vomiting. Pear juice used in this way is effective for a few hours. This may be unpleasant, the person may feel bad all the time (could be most of afternoon) because of abdominal pain, headache, “hits of energy”, etc, depending how sensitive he or she is. Pear juice works quite suddenly, therefore one to three days before using it, you better wash the intestine with water (so that it is not clogged because if it is, the pain and the spasms are stronger). Of course, this does not happen in such a way in case of every person. There are people who, with full intestine, if they drink one liter (0.26 gal.) of pear juice, feel not more than just a little rumble in the belly (which indicat es that the intestine is so large). There are also people who have nausea and feel very strong pain having drunk only two glasses of the juice — this method is not for them. I have described this method for those who would like to try it and experience, how it works in their case. If you are not sure, how it will work on you, you may start from just one glass of the juice and see, what will happen. In the next try you may increase the juice amount if one glass works too week. WASHING THE WHOLE GASTROINTE STINAL TRACT There are other methods for cleaning the intestine, not only the large one, also the small one. Simultaneously the whole digestive track and the gall bladder are cleaned. The most known and efficient method origins from vedic culture. Describi ng it very briefly : Make about 1% solution of salt in warm water. It should taste like a soup with too much salt. Totally you will need approximately four liters (1 gal.) (12 -15 glasses). Drink salted water in glasses of 250ml (0.26 qt.) . After each glas s make the following 4 exercises: "},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 44 1) in an upright position, bend your torso towards right and left alternately, holding your hands up coupling fingers in a lock 2) .in an upright position, twist your torso. Feet stand firmly on the floor. And you try to twist the way to see what’s behind your back. You may lead your right arm behind your back when you twist towards right, and lead your left arm behind the back when you twist towards left. 3) in a position of “resting on elbows, lying on a belly” twist your torso to see your heels, twist it towards right and left alternately. 4) squt down with your legs straddling wide. Put your left knee down on the floor and press your belly with your right leg (with its inner side), helping yourself with the right hand. Simultaneously, try to twist your torso towards right. The back should be straight. Repeat the same symmetrically. These exercises will push the solution until the anus. The first and the second exercises empty the stomach out of water, thus the nex t time you will drink a glass of water, it will go in as easy as the first one. Make sure the water is salty enough. It is important because if you drink pure not salty water, it’ll stay in the stomach. It’s different with salty water: when it penetrates into stomach, the stomach opens its sphincter and gets rid of all salty water as soon as possible, passing it into the intestine. After every four glasses of salty water (or earlier, it depends on a person) you’ll feel you want to go to the bathroom. You need to continue drinking until the solution begins to flow from the anus. First it looks like a diarrhea, then brown water and at the end it will be clear. As a rule, 3-4 liters (0.8 -1 gal.) of water will be enough. Then, to finish, you drink two glasses of clean water only. If the water still goes into intestine and goes out the same way as the previous glasses of water, it means that the sphincter of your stomach is still open. You need to close it. It is simple. Drink a glass of pure water and provoke vomiting (put two fingers on the back of tongue). It will return the digestive system into operation condition. This method in yoga is called Shank Prakshalana . In case of most people this works well even if the proper exercises are not done. Instead of the exercises you can make some abdomen movements and pressing. Think that you are moving the solution from the stomach, through the intestines, until the anus. There are two youtube videos where you can watch how to do Shank h Prakshalana : Part 1: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aQ6zdWQcyw Part 2: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM3hf8aaiwI "},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 45 TUBE 2 - THE BLOODSTREAM ALLOWING THE RIV ER OF LIFE TO FLOW As Dr. William Wong so eloquently puts it, \"The bloodstream is the river of life, but is also the river of trash.\" Cleansing your bloodstream and bringing it back to an optimal state is critical for AGGRESSIVE HEALTH. He re are two pictures. One of them is of healthy blood and one is taken from the excellent book 'How You Rot And Rust' which can be ordered from www.biomedx.com. It is from a patient diagnosed with inoperable cancer and given 30 days to live by her doctor. The picture shows deterioration on the slide after 30 mins. Which picture would you want for your blood? As you can see, the bloodstream is a powerful mirror image of your current state of health. In the healthy blood, red cells are of a s imilar size and shape, reside freely in their own space and gently bounce off each other. The goal of AGGRESSIVE HEALTH is to get your blood looking like this. Remember the simple formula - when your blood looks great, you feel great! In the other picture t he blood stream looks like a war zone. If you are interested in live blood analysis contact me at www.aggressivehealth.co.uk where we discuss these principles in more depth. COOKED WASTE CLOGS THE BLOODSTREAM To illustrate the power of food on the bloodstream, watch the video by Dr. Michael Klaper, entitled 'A Diet For All Reasons'. Dr. Klaper shows you the effects of a typical cooked meat and pasteurised milk diet. After only a few hours of ingesting this waste, the blood becomes very thick and heavy! D id you know that there are more heart attacks in the United States on Thanksgiving Day than any other day of the year? Is there a connection here? SURGEONS KNOW THIS - WHY DON'T YOU? Did you know that surgeons refuse to operate on a patient unless they'v e fasted on water for at least 8 hours? They know from first hand experience the dangers involved when the bloodstream isn't flowing freely enough. Cooked foods insulate and dampen your body's electrical nervous system. Senses become dulled and life becomes grey rather than colourful. Enough. What can you do about this situation today? "},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 46 STEPS TO PERFECT HEALTH THROUGH FOCUSING ON THE BLOOD Many of the principles discussed so far, namely a high raw diet , plenty of chlorophyll rich foods (wheatgrass juice, E3Live, green superfoods and juiced greens), a high volume of sprouted foods (pulses, seeds, nuts and grains), along with healthy fats can make all the difference to the look of your blood and the way you feel. One critical reason why all of these principl es work so well is their direct effect on supplying alkalising minerals to the body. CANCER: OXYGEN DEFICIENCY AT ITS WORST 1 in 3 people now die from cancer, but does it have to be this way? Even whilst the struggle continues, a German biochemist, Dr O tto Warburg, won a Nobel Prize for his research into cancer and oxygen. He discovered that cancer cells thrive in an oxygen- poor environment and concluded that cancer is nothing but the process of cell mutation caused by oxygen deprivation on the cellular level. Even though he arrived at this discovery more than fifty years ago, his theory has never been discredited. DO YOU WANT TO INCREASE THE OXYGEN CARRYING CAPACITY OF YOUR BLOOD? Wheatgrass juice is your answer! Do you remember the last time you cut yourself? Do you remember seeing red oxygen rich blood ? The reason it was red is because of the pigment Haemoglobin, but haemoglobin is more tha n just a pigment, it brings life to every part of your body. And in the same way, chlorophyll is the green oxyg en rich pigment that brings life to plants. Think of chlorophyll as 'green plant blood'! In 1930, Dr Hans Fisher and a group of associates won the Nobel Prize, after making a groundbreaking discovery. Their work was based around the mysteries of the red blood cell. To their amazement they found that on a molecular level, haemoglobin in human blood is practically identical to chlorophyll (plant blood). The ONLY difference between the two pigments is that chlorophyll has a core of magnesium, whilst haemoglobin has a core of iron. The resemblance between the two is so striking that: • When crude chlorophyll is fed to rabbits with anaemia (low serum iron count) it restores normal red blood cell counts within approximately 15 days and is completely non toxic. • A simple injection of crude chlorophyll increases red blood cell counts in healthy animals that already have normal haemoglobin levels. "},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 47 USING THE POWER OF NATURE TO CURE ANAEMIA As many as 30% of all women beyond the age of puberty in the United States may be anaemic. For men the rate of anaemia begins to increase by age 50. The major symptoms of anaemia are fatigue and loss of appetite and these symptoms usually coincide with deficiencies of various nutrients, such as B12, folic acid, iron, copper, potassium and protein. In 1936, research into the power of chlorophyll went one step further. Scientists J.H. Hughs and A.L. Latner of the University of Liverpool conducted some groundbreaking experiments. In their study, reported in the Journal of Physiology in 1936, they created a number of anaemic animals by bleeding them at regular intervals. Once the animals' haemoglobin levels were slashed in half, they were divided into ten different groups. • Five of the groups were fed various types of chlorophyll in their diet. • The other five groups of control animals were fed no chlorophyll. The animals that received raw, unrefined chlorophyll experienced a regeneration of their blood haemoglobin levels 50% above average. In less than two weeks their blood haemoglobin levels were normal! The group receiving synthetic chlorophyll made no marked improvements, highlighting that only raw, unrefined chlorophyll can be converted into haemoglobin. Synthetic versions created by decomposing natural chlorophyll and combining it with a copper ion proved to be incredibly stable, but CAUSED nausea and anaemia rather than curing it! EMBRACE AGGRESSIVE HEALTH TODAY WITHOUT WASTING MONEY ON USELESS SUPPLEMENTS When compared to many of today's expensive supplements, wheatgrass is not only far superior, but easy to grow and easy to use. Simply take a handful of wheat berries, some water, a tray filled with an inch of topsoil and a cover. Within seven days at minimal cost , you'll have enough wheatgrass to juice. Drink it daily and you'll maximize the charge of electricity around each and every one of your ten trillion cells. Wheatgrass juice is not only a superior source of chlorophyll, but also gives you a concentrated dose of high- quality water, oxygen, enzymes, phytochemicals, carotenoids, fatty acids, trace minerals, antioxidants and amino acids. If you want to stand out from the crowd, with a glint in your eye and a magic about your aura – drink wheatgrass juice. It is alive, and brings life to your body in every way. It will help you to release an unnatural build up of excess fats and mineral deposits. It will also help you to release proteins trapped in your blood, organs and bowel. Every element within wheatgrass juice rushes to revitalize your entire being! Awesome! STARTING TODAY - A NEW BEGINNING! Along with wheatgrass juice and other grass juices such as barley grass juice, eat, blend and juice as many different varieties of raw/wild organic greens as you can! Choose from herbs and big leafy green vegetables. All herbs hav e rejuvenating properties and some of the more common varieties, such as lettuce, celery, parsley, coriander (cilantro) etc. are very powerful foods. I juice a lot of spinach, kale, spring greens, parsley, cucumber and"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 48 celery. Remember there isn't a labora tory in the world that is a complex as the one found within the photosynthetic green leaf organs of plants. GO HUNTING FOR WILD GREENS AND PREPARE FOR THE ULTIMATE 'HIGH' The idea of eating and juicing more green- leafy vegetables, especially wild herbs , is to significantly alkaliz e your biochemistry and electrify your blood. But what does this REALLY mean? Most of the junk that lines the supermarket shelves (the coffees, cola, beer, spirits, pizza, chips, cake, sweets etc.) create an acidic environment. In an acidic environment, vital minerals are used up to neutralize the acid, oxygen levels are depleted and as a consequence energy plummets. At this point most people reach for another stimulant such as coffee or chocolate when all they need to do is beg in to alkali ze their body. This is where greens and vegetable juices exert their power. Use them daily and you can turn poor health into EXPLOSIVE HEALTH! If you want to feel a surge of electricity through your bloodstream and through you body, green foods are the answer. Over time, let green vegetable juices step in to provide you with (what will feel like) rocket fuel to launch you into your day. But wait! There exists another superfood that has five times more chlorophyll than wheatgrass jui ce and a potent mineral content to match. E3LIVE - NATURE'S MOST COMPLETE FOOD Unlike fruits or vegetables that lose many of their vital nutrients during packing and transit, nature has created a food that grows thousands of miles from your door, but ca n be delivered to you frozen, maintaining every vital nutrient. This food is Aphanizomenon flos - aquae (AFA). It is a blue- green algae grown/harvested in its natural state from the mineral rich waters of the Upper Klamath Lake in southern Oregon. It is genetically prepared for extreme alterations in temperature, especially in winter when parts of Klamath Lake freeze over. But when the weather warms up, the algae comes out of its frozen dormancy and resumes its active growth cycle. AFA algae is high in lipids and free fatty acids, which protect it from crysta llizing in low temperature conditions. Bee pollen works the same way, it can be frozen without losing any of its nutritional value. Marvellous! WITH FIVE TIMES MORE CHLOROPHYLL THAN WHEATGRASS - ENSURE YOU DON'T MISS OUT! E3Live has the highest concentration of bio- assimilable chlorophyll than any other food. It has five times more chlorophyll than wheatgrass, twice as much as spirulina algae, and slightly more than chlorella algae. Chlorophyll is the lif eblood of AFA algae. According to biochemist Lita Lee, Ph.D., \"Chlorophyll appears to stimulate the regeneration of damaged liver cells, and increases circulation to all organs by dilating blood vessels. In the heart, chlorophyll aids in the transmissio n of nerve impulses that control contraction. The heart rate is slowed, yet each contraction is increased in power, improving the efficiency of cardiac power.\" "},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 49 E3Live is 100% AFA (Aphanizomenon Flos -Aquae). It is 60%+ protein, containing all the amino acids, making it 100% natural brain food. AFA algae is 97% absorbable by the body, contains every B vitamin (although the B12 is said to be unavailable to the body) and every known trace mineral. AFA algae contains 10 to 50 times as many minerals as vegetables and is extremely rich in (hard to find) trace minerals, which you may be deficient in. Without trace minerals, many of your enzymic reactions can be compromised. E3Live is also abundant in enzymes, phytochemicals and essential fatty acids, especially the important Omega 3 fatty acids that you need for the formation of eicosanoids.

SPROUTS, UNLIMITED HEALTH AND CANCER PREVENTION? As far back as 1978 Dr. Charles Shaw and Dr. Chiu- Nan at the University of Texas Cancer Centre tested a variety of foods to determine whether they had any anti -cancer"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 50 properties. The chosen foods included lentil sprouts, mung bean sprouts, wheat sprouts, as well as carrots and parsley. The foods were then tested on mice inoculated with carcinogens (cancer causing substances). Although the carrots and parsley did show an inhibitory effect on the carcinogens, the true heroes of the experiment were the sprouts. They inhibited the activity of the carcinogens, even when small dosages of the sprout extracts were used. The other major benefit was that the extract wasn't toxic even in high dosages. (Most known inhibitors of carcinogens are toxic at even moderately high levels of concentration.) With this information fresh in your mind, let me introduce you to my secret for weapon for power packed workouts and life energy that is second to none... TUBE 3 - THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM DELIVERING NUTRIENTS, ELIMINATING W ASTE The importance of your lymphatic system should NEVER be understated. On a moment by moment basis, it rids your body of toxins, dead cells, cancer cells, nitrogenous wastes, trapped protein, fatty globules, pathogenic bacteria, infectious viruses, for eign substances and heavy metals. If it is congested, you need to take immediate action today to stimulate its flow. Failure to do so could result in your cells stewing in their own waste, starved of nutrients. THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO STIMULATE LYMPHAT IC FLOW – REBOUNDING As you know, you have four times as much lymph fluid as you do blood, but you don't have a pump (like the heart) to keep the lymph fluid flowing. So what can you do to stimulate your own lymph flow? Rebounding. That is, buy a mini trampoline and bounce! The lymphatic flow becomes very active during rebounding but sluggish under resting conditions,\" states Arthur C. Guyton, M.D., chairman of the department of Physiology and Biophysics at the University of Mississippi School of Medicine. \"During rebounding, the rate of lymph flow can increase as much as 15 times because of the increased activity.\" Your lymphatic system is filled with many valves allowing lymph to flow in one direction away from gravity. The rhythmical bouncing causes all of the one- way valves to open and close simultaneously increasing lymph flow. The lymph ducts expand during rebounding and the increased lymph flow flushes more toxins through your lymphatic system. Now you have no excuses! For as little as $30, you can increase your lymphatic flow by 1500%! "},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 51 SPACE REASEARCH DISCOVERS MIRACULOUS EXERCISE Researchers at N.A.S.A. found that rebounding was 68% more efficient than treadmills or other forms of exercise. One NA.S.A study called rebounding a \"miracle ex ercise\". N.A.S.A. also found rebounding to be the most effective exercise for helpful astronauts rebuild bone and muscle mass post in the non- stimulating weightlessness of space. TARGET YOUR SKIN AND ENHANCE LYMPHATIC FLOW EVEN FURTHER The largest organ of elimination is your skin. It is responsible for 1/4 of your body's daily elimination of waste, with one pound of waste being discharged through it EVERY day. If the pores of your skin become choked with dead cells, so does its ability to eliminate, but fear not! One of the most effective methods for keeping this vital organ functioning perfectly is dry skin brushing. Not only does it help maintain excellent skin tone, but it improves your digestion, stimulates lymphatic flow and strengthens your immune system. TWO MINUTES PER DAY IS ALL YOU NEED Simply buy a natural bristle brush with a long wooden handle and brush your entire body. Start with the soles of your feet (the nerve endings here affect your entire body) and brush towards your heart. Do circ ular counter -clockwise strokes on your belly and remember to avoid your face and nipples. The best time to do this is in the morning before your daily bath or shower, when your skin is completely dry. Also, never share your brush with anyone. Wash it every couple of weeks. REJUVENATE WITH SAUNA DETOXIFICATION A gentleman in America spent the best part of his working life surrounded by diesel fuel and exhaust fumes. He experienced constant migraine headaches, varying sickness, had achy joints and was so allergic to most modern buildings and appliances that he was considering moving to the desert! Fortunately a close friend told him about a sauna detoxification centre and the gentleman checked in. When the gentleman began the program, the det oxification process was so powerful, that the other people in the sauna were forced to leave. Eventually the centre built a special exhaust vent to expel the fumes out of the building! That's how powerful the detoxification process can be!

Maybe you consider yourself somewhere in between. One thing is for sure, there are no excuses. Movement is as critical as any nutrient! You are about to learn about the bare minimum, the base line standard, the level that you will always strive to stay above, whatever challenges life throws at you. If you are an athlete, the first part of this chapter isn't for you, but you might know of someone who could benefit from the following prescription. For everyone else, ask yourself the followi ng question: What is the minimum amount of exercise necessary before reaching a point of no returns, with regard to longevity? The following table was compiled through research taken from Harvard graduates. Treat this as your minimum daily requirement and success is yours.

Answer: An approximate calorie expenditure of 2000 calories per week/just under 300 calories a day. But let's forget calories! If you're female, two 20 minute sessions on your rebounder every day will reduce your risk of breast cancer by a staggering 70%. Amazing! The term 'aerobic' means, literally, 'with oxygen,' and refers to of moderate exercise you can sustain over long periods of time, rather than short intense bursts.

If you want to tap into your fat burning potential, aerobic exercise will increase your sensitivity to the hormone insulin, the importance of which will become apparent in the n ext chapter when you learn how to kick -start your fat metabolism. THE POWER OF FASTING ASK YOURSELF I suggest you think deeply over these questions, analyze them and answer them to yourself. 1. Why almost everything that human eats is later excreted as feces, urine, mucus, sebum, gases, blood etc.? Does it mean that this perfect organism is a machine for processing almost all eaten things to produce excretions? 2. Why there are no illnesses caused by non -eating or by fasting, but there are so many diseases caused by eating? 3. Why so many diseases (often bothering a person for years) completely disappear during long enough fasting? 4. Why fasting statistics show the highest efficiency rate among physical healing methods among available on Earth? 5. When treated for drug addiction (either alcohol or nicotine, narcotics, caffeine, sugar etc.), the body shows some unpleasant reaction (called clinical symptoms). When stopping to eat people show the same clinical symptoms. Why the symptoms in both cases are the same? When a recovered addict returns to his/her addiction, the reactions in his/her body are the same as appear in a person who restarts eating after a long period of fasting. Again, why the reactions are the same in both cases? 6. Researches sh ow that some people can live without food for months or years, but others die just after a dozen of days. Why? 7. People and animals, when they are ill, have no appetite. In such cases animals stop eating when they feel ill and resume eating when they feel healthy. If an ill human fasts, he/she also becomes healthy much faster. Why does the body react like this? Do you have any other question related to this subject?"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 54 Human body has a sophisticated cleansing system. Removing the redundant and poisoning su bstances is done with the feces, urine, exhalation, mucus, sebum, perspiration, blood, lymph, tears, hears, nails and epidermis (flaking off). The human body can be compared to a machine excreting waste, which is produced mostly from what the human consumes. The functioning of the machine called the human body depends on efficiency of its cleansing system. If the body is being fully cleansed as it is going and it does not store anything for later time, then the body is working properly. But if the body (this happens most often) is unable to transform and remove substances inserted in its interior in too big amounts, then the body accumulates them. It accumulates them in form of, for example, glycogen in the liver, fat under the skin or between the muscle ti ssues, a gunge of unknown composition in a cyst, heavy metal chemical compounds in the bones, bone marrow or brain. The body of a person eating a lot of food (especially if it is full of toxins), breathing poisonous gases contained in the air, drinking poisoned water has a serious trouble because the body is unable to sufficiently cleanse itself. In this case the body is accumulating everything that it isn't able to remove at once, so that the cleansing and excreting system is not stopped. Then if from tim e to time you let the body to rest, in other words, you breath clean air and fast long enough, the body removes the harmful toxins. These accumulated substances (in other words: toxins) are one of the most often causes or diseases. This is why fasting, esp ecially dry, is the most effective human body physical curing method known on Earth. Fasting made in the right way “produces miracles” because it removes “incurable” diseases. This is so simple information that even elementary school children are able to understand it; but why so many doctors do not know about it? When they do not know how to cure an ill person they say it is an incurable disease, but the fact is that incurable diseases do not exist. There are people who do not know how to cure an ill pers on . If these people form a majority, if they create a strong suggestion group and if instead of admitting their inexperience they talk about incurable disease, then the myth about incurable diseases is created. One does not have to be a scientist, doctor or philosopher in order to understand a simple fact that a contaminated body needs some resting from eating and from continues contaminating in order to remove from itself the poisoning substances. Giving the contaminated body some chemical compounds called “medicines” is one of most often errors made by humans because of their insufficient knowledge. Eating these chemicals poisons the body even more. How does it work, the body cleansing system of a statistical inhabitant of the “Western World”, where people do not starve because there is too much food? Let's compare this to a car engine. If the engine's rpm is from two to three thousands, the car will serve you for years without engine problems. But if the engine constantly is forced to work at seven thous and or more rpm, it will break down in a short time. The body cleansing system of an average inhabitant of the “Western World” can be compared to this engine which howls at maximum rpm. It is a real wonder how strong is the human body cleansing system. Non human build machine would be able to stand such a treatment. "},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 55 The cleansing system consists mainly of the liver, kidneys, skin, lungs and large intestine. These are the organs which are overloaded with work caused by too much eating. This is why large int estine cancer, liver cancer, skin tumors belong to most often occurring diseases these days. An organ being forced to overwork will break down earlier, after a few, a dozen or even after a few tens of years. The human organs mentioned above perform the wor k at 100% but in order to keep the body clean they should not exceed 70% of their performance. The best would be not more than half of the performance. Results of many researches about the impact of food on humans unequivocally prove the same thing that the more a human eats the worse health he/she has, the more often becomes ill, the faster ages and the earlier dies. Statistically, decreasing the food intake by half extends the biological life time by at least 20%. If the statistical inhabitant of the “Wes tern World” would decrease the amount of eaten food by four fold (some people would have to eat even ten times less) the body life time of 120 years would be a statistical normality. “What is in too big quantity, that is unhealthy” (a Polish saying) — it is a fact, but “What is in too little quantity, that is harming.” it is also a fact. For every person there is a quantity which is proper. In this concern you better look with less seriousness at all those charts and tables which present a relation between the body weight, amount and calories of food. It is more beneficial to use the conscious eating method in order to find for yourself the three factors: what, how much and when the body should eat so that it will function properly. In this concern generali zation may bring more harms than benefits. If mind activity is not considered then it can be said that the main causes of human body biological aging are contamination by toxins, fat excess and low energy level. Many people practicing sufficiently long fasting feel like their bodies rejuvenate. The process of biological age reversion caused by fasting or inedia is a known phenomenon, which is proven not only by body appearance but also by results of clinical research. NOT EATING and LONG FASTING - IS IT POSSIBLE? Ask yourself: What does an electron eat so that it has lots of energy and it can live forever if nothing destroys it? How about the atoms of the human body? A person who sufficiently understands physics knows that the matter and energy are derived from a common source and that they can be influenced by the mind and also that the result of an experiment depends on the experimenter 's expectation. So energy and the matter depend on the mind. Therefore the creation and behavior of energy and the matter depends on the mind (which is a set of programs). The human body is the most sophisticated integrated and self -controlling program - energetic -electronic -chemical -mechanical system known to man. Just the human body itself remains a largely unknown st ructure controlled by the mind. Studding physics, sacred geometry, chemistry, electronics and informatics allows a person to better understand the human mind and body. On the other hand, the more an open minded scientist is engaged in this research, the mo re he/she is willing to acknowledge “I know that I know nothing”. "},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 56 Please read this inspiring part written by Jack Davis: “I have resisted sharing publicly my unusual life experience until now. Having survived in excellent health for 22 years on perhaps 5% of average American caloric intake and perhaps 1% of food variety must have proven something of potential value to share with others. A typical question I often encounter is, “ How do you get your protein?\" It seems that most people believe that consum ption of flesh and other high protein substances provide tiny building blocks of some sort from which the human frame is constructed. I believe that food consumption only releases qualities of stored energy which stimulates hormones and organs to initiate and sustain life processes. The body produces and maintains itself through the wisdom and vitality and memory of living cells. The vital blood system, with its miles of veins and microscopic capillaries distributes vitality via gasses and liquids, not solids. This marvelous blood system also collects and disposes of wastes generated from constant cell growth and replacement. The lungs and the skin feed and clean the blood through the process of respiration. The large intestine carries away most of the solid waste. Chemically speaking, the hydrogen atom, with one proton and one electron orbiting a nucleus is no different from the other 100 plus chemical elements except that the other elements have more protons and electrons orbiting each nucleus. These 100 plus atomic elements comprise the physicality of all substances of earth and cosmos: rocks, trees, animals, buildings, airplanes, etc. Atoms do not eat nor do molecules eat . I believe that food does not supply basic building blocks nor is it necessary for supplying the life force which animates human cells. The human body is capable of transmuting one element from another and of absorbing life force from air and light. Consuming food is not the optimum method for supplying polarized energy to sustain life. Often, the energy required for processing physical food through the digestive system, to say nothing of processing drugs, medicines, toxins, and pollutants is more than energy potentially available in the food source consumed. After a big meal what the body wants most is sleep. Over -consumption of physical food also signals the body that the entity involved is desirous of storing extra energy for some possible future deficit of intake. This extra fuel, or stimulant, is converted to a substance called fat a nd is integrated into body bulk. The heavier frame then requires yet more energy to transport itself from place to place. It has less flexibility and less desire to exercise and breathe fully, so the degeneration process accelerates toward pain, disease, a nd death. The amazing human body with its programmed bio system is a blessed gift. Trillions of complex, interrelated, interdependent processes are functioning in cooperation and in harmony every second. I believe that the optimum way to provide what is r equired to maintain this marvelous bio-machine is through deep breathing of pure air, by ingesting pure water, by absorbing cosmic rays through the skin and retinas of the"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 57 eyes. It has been demonstrated that wearing eyeglasses, especially sunglasses, block s essential solar rays from contacting the retinas, with degenerating consequences for the body. Doctor John Ott explains this phenomenon in his book, Light and Health. Currently, I gaze at or toward the sun during the first 30 minutes of sunrise. I do t his while swimming in the ocean each morning. During this 30 minute period of solar ray absorption plus another 30 minutes of vigorous crawl stroke swimming I am breathing deeply and rapidly. This hour of sun- gazing, deep breathing, physical exercise, and ocean water immersion provides more than enough cosmic energy to maintain this body and to sustain it through 8 or more hours of strenuous physical activity, like clearing the jungle growth where I live” . HEALING FAST Statistically, fasting is the most effective physical method to heal man. It is the cheapest and fastest way to: – get rid of the most serious illnesses (cancer, diabetes, coronary diseases, high blood pressure, eczema, asthma, and so on); – permanently better the health; – rejuvenate the body; – slim the body; – get rid of the collected toxins and parasites; – rise body's life energy level; – better the psyche mood. WHAT HAPPENS DURING FASTING? After 2 -4 days of not eating, the body switches to endogenous nourishment. This means the body starts utiliz ing other sources of energy. During the first days of fasting the person may experience hunger, but once the body switches to endogenous nourishment (after 2 -4 days, it depends), the hunger disappears and the thoughts of food does not bother the fasting person anymore. Do not be afraid, when the body switches to endogenous nourishment, it is very smart and it will never start eating the main life sustaining systems like heart or brain, etc.. First of all it starts “eating out” its own weak, ill or damag ed cells. The main principle that body follows during the fasting: everything that is not necessary for life, or damaging the proper body functioning should be eliminated. That’s why fasting is so effective especially in the cases of any cancer: during t wo -three weeks the body destroys the cells with damaged DNA, and has enough time to produce up to 5- 8 generations of healthy cells, bearing proper DNA code, that has been duplicated up to 5- 8 times, thus building a very solid foundation for the person’s perfect health. During initial two to three weeks of fasting your disposition can be quite changing. There is no need to be concerned (within limits of reason, of course) about your body weakness, pain, dizziness, nausea or other symptoms occurring during this time. These are body"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 58 cleansing or self -healing signs. However, later, when the body approaches its natural state, which usually takes two to three weeks (can be much longer in case of obese person), your disposition becomes perfect. Only then (maybe for the first time in life) you understand what it means to feel well and to be truly healthy. You have so much energy, will to live, work and to be physically active and also big creativity manifests. WHY LONG FASTING IS SO BENEFICIAL? High concentrat ions of toxins in the organs and tissues interfere their proper functioning. But it is even more dangerous that they actively destroy the organs and tissues - the longer they stay there, the more damage and destruction they cause. The most radical and the most effective way to get rid of these deposits of toxins is to start a healing fasting (hunger cure). It is not possible to get rid of all the toxins during one fasting, since you’ ve been accumulating them for decades . And I’m going to tell you right away that the first fasting is the hardest. You should be ready for it psychologically . During your first fasting your general condition may worsen gradually. This happens due to the increase of amount of toxins that are being released from the deposits into your blood flow. Scientifically it is called toxemia. But it’s not as bad as the disease itself. Actually, the first two days of fasting is not fasting at all. And I will explain you why: the body has enough of its reserves. If you feel hunger, you sh ould know that it is not physical hunger but only psychological. The body has got accustomed to the fact that you feed it every few hours, and when you stop eating it is very surprised and acts like a little spoiled child. But very soon it will understand that you are not going to be under its thumb, and the hunger will go away. Those people who practice fastings regularly do not feel hunger right from the first day. Their bodies are well disciplined and do not whimper like a child. Biological explanation: the organism has a reserve in the form of glucose (it is stored in the form of glycogen in our liver). This reserve is enough to feed the body for 48 hours (2 days ) of fasting. Glucose goes directly into our blood and supplies the body with energy in the most digestive and easy form. Thus , the first 48 hours of not eating is not fasting for our body at all, it is just a period of “unloading” when your digestive system may have some rest (more or less, comparing to habitual eating). Glucose is the main source of energy for our body, and especially for our brain (do not confuse it with sugar that we buy in the stores - it is chemically produced sucrose which is very unhealthy for our body). What is the main source of energy for our heart? It is not glucose at all, it is unsaturated fatty acids . They are produced out of fat of our body. That is why fastings are so beneficial for our heart . During fastings our body produces a huge amount of fatty acids and uses them for metabolic processes, transforming these acids into pure energy. As you can see, during the fasting our heart does not starve at all, it has a great time of f EA sting, and not fasting! As for our brain, the brain does not receive as much glucose as usual, that’s why it may seem that the thoughts slow down. It does not make any harm, instead, it is only"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 59 beneficial for the brain. The brain calms down, it is good time for it to relax. Many stressful thoughts, worries and destructive thoughts just go away. That is why the fasting is so powerful not only for the body rejuvenation, but for your psyche (mind) as well – the body and mind are interconnected . IMPORTANT: As for cancer, cancer cells use glucose to live and grow. They require 8 times more glucose than a normal cell. Therefore, it is important to avoid high levels of glucose in your blood. As you can see, during fastings the body’s main source of energy is fat acids and not glucose, that is why fastings are so effective in case of any cancer . And once again: the fasting that is less than three days can not be considered as healing fasting, it’s just a good time for your digestive system to relax. That is why when you have been fasting for a week , in fact it is only 5 days, when you have been fasting for 10 days, in fact it is only 8 days and so on. If you do not eat for less than three days the body temporarily loses weight due to the loss of water, salts and glycogen. All this comes back in a couple of days of eating. The true fasting starts only on the third day . Bad taste in your mouth is a sign of release of toxins. And it is good . The toxins go out though our breathing system, kidneys, digestive system, skin and mouth cavity. The body uses all means and ways to eliminate the toxins. Wash your mouth with clean water as often as you need, cleanse your tongue. The thicker the layer of coat on your tongue, the more toxins you have in your body. This kind of thin coat covers not only your tongue but the whole digestive system. Weakness is caused by toxemia, that is, by toxins circulating from their deposits to the liver and kidneys though your blood . The second reason for weakness is switching of your metabolism to a different fuel : the body switches from glucose to fatty acids that require a longer process of decomposition after which they ca n be turned into pyruvic acid – the final simple substance that powers our body. Those people who have diabetes (in which the mechanism of digestion of glucose is broken) should make a conclusion, that fasting is the most natural physiological method to cure diabetes. Firstly , fasting gives a chance to cells producing insulin to recover. Secondly, the body learns to use alternative source of energy, fatty acids, that is. Thirdly , the body of a diabetic learns to overcome hypoglycemia (a state in which there is a low level of glucose in the blood) . Why fasting is so effective in case of diabetes? During fasting the body switches from carbohydrate metabolism (on which the whole structure of diabetes is built up) to fatty acids. During a fasting your body gets energy from fatty acids and all these measurements of sugar level in your blood become meaningless and useless. During a long fasting your pancreatic gland that produces insulin gets a chance to fully recover. The human body can function without eating very long time. It depends on many factors, mainly: Conscience sphere of the person, fat and muscle reserves, psyche state, environment temperature, physical acti vity. Longest fasts documented by medical research lasted over fifteen months. The fasting person drunk up to two glasses of water"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 60 per day and felt very well during the whole time. Fasts lasting up to three months are nothing extraordinary or dangerous for the body of overweight person. When the human stops inserting food and drink into their body, the body first removes (during the period of initial few days to a few weeks) substances constituting the biggest obstacles in its functioning. Water, as a solvent, is needed by the body so that it can remove redundant and toxic substances. This is why the body needs water during initial few days to few weeks of fasting. How much? Usually not much, one liter (1 qt) or one glass per day; it depends, among others, on the individual, climate and physical activity. Having sufficiently cleansed itself the body decreases its water requirement to the level of a few to a dozen cubic centimeters per day. Drinking may become unnecessary in favorable environmental conditions when the body needs no water. Drinking impacts body weight. If a fasting person drinks only as much as their body demands, his/her body weight goes down until the best level for this person is reached. Right body weight for a given person may considerably differ from what is defined by so called common sense and (dependences between height and weight) data published in tables. The right body weight is when the body has no excess and no deficiency, not when its shape most appeals to other people. Most people do not believe that body of the proper weight looks almost like a skeleton covered wit h skin. Short fasting (from a few days up to 7- 10 days) are not so effective because the body does not have enough time to get rid of all the illnesses and regenerate the body. Optimal fasting period for any average person with normal body weight is at least three weeks (or 21 days). Why 21 days? It will be explained a bit later. There are a few main methods of healing a person via fasting: 1) Dry fasting — nothing is taken into the mouth, even not a drop of a liquid. 2) Ordinary or water fasting —only water is consumed. 3) With herbs — the only consumed thing are liquid herb infusions (usually for a short time). 4) With juices — (the proper name for this is: juice diet or liquidarian diet) fruit or vegetable juices are drunk. In case of most people s uffering because of so called civilization diseases, which are commonly considered incurable, healing fast is a way to restore full health. Individually, depending on the person, the fasting can take from a single day till ... sometimes even a few months or even over a year. But in case of an ordinary, not overweight person, an inhabitant of, so called, western civilization the maximum fasting time is about 6 weeks. Most often fasting takes from 7 to 28 days. 3 weeks of water fasting (21 days) in most cas es is the an optimal period. During 21 days of fasting the body has enough time to eliminate most of the toxins, get rid of its diseases and update itself in a more healthy state. Of course it is not always possible to eliminate all of the toxins and cure all the diseases – if you’ve been intoxicating your body for a few decades, do not expect to restore full 100% health just in three weeks. For sure, even after the first water fasting you will feel much much better, but if you need to gain perfect health, stick to raw food diet and perform further fastings (dry of water) once you feel you are ready to continue. Each new time it will be much easier: the body will have less toxins,"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 61 it’s more healthy and you do not have fears to fast, because you already know through your own experience that it is not so scary. As for fears, almost every psychically healthy person can fast if he/she is not afraid and not forced to do it. Emotions (not lack of food) awaken by the fear during fasting can kill the body. DRY FAS TING According to the principle: “the simplest solutions are the most efficient ones”, dry fasting, during which nothing is taken into the mouth, even not a drop of water, produces the deepest cleanup and cure of the body. Actually, to make it most efficient, one does not even (literally) touch any water. The body should remain without any liquid during the whole fasting period. It can be said, that a week of dry fasting is as efficient as two to three weeks of fasting on just water. Fasting without any w ater can last from 1 to 14 days. It depends on some factors. The drier and the hotter the air, the shorter time a person can stay without drinking. The more physical activity causing perspiring is involved, the shorter the body can stand without water. Whe n the conditions (temperature, air humidity, physical activity of the person) are normal, an ordinary inhabitant of the mild climate region can dry fast for 7 days. The body can slightly dehydrate during dry fasting. It is allowed to let the body to dehydr ate a little, but it is important, during the whole time of dry fasting, to regularly check the body. When the dehydration of the body crosses a critical level, this process cannot be normally reversed (restore the proper hydration of the body) and then the body stops working (dies). Ordinarily the first 4 days without drinking (and eating) do not require any special care, but later the hydration level of the body should be monitored, for example, by observing the skin. Another important factor, which determine the period of time the body can dry fast without any harm, is the amount of substances to be excreted from the body. For example; if a person have eaten a lot of salty food, what caused more salt to be accumulated in the body, it wouldn't be wise to start dry fasting without first removing the excess salt. You can draw a conclusion from this, that before starting a dry fast it is worth to do water fasting for a few days. A good procedure can be this one. You start with water fasting. From the day eig ht do not take water any more. In this way you start dry fasting when the body has get rid of the excess salt and other substances, which need water in order to be removed. Usually after only two, three days of fasting the body's thirst for water becomes q uite small, so giving up water after a week of fasting is not a real challenge. WATER FASTING Water is the only substance allowed to be consumed. The water should be clean, the best is rain or snow water (collected far from polluted air) or distiled water. If you use distiled water, first cool it till ice starts to appear, then put it back as ready for drinking. Drink room temperature water or warm it. Nothing is added to the water, no sugar, not even a drop of lemon juice, no honey, no coffee or tea. Dr inking water with added substances disturbs the digesting process and"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 62 does not allow the body to switch on the internal nourishing (and to switch off the digestive tract). Fasting, when the internal nourishing is not working, wears the body away faster. This manifests, among others, via faster weight losing and worse mood, and may cause accelerated depletion of minerals. This process is called starvation; if it is being extended, it can bring death to the body. Water fast can take from one day to a few ( in extreme cases even more than a dozen) months. The length depends on, among others, the total weight of the accumulated excess matter (mainly fat) and the physical activity of the fasting person. In average, it can be assumed, to “burn” 1 kg (2.2 lb.) of body fat, 2 to 4 days are needed. For example, a person having 20 kg (44 lb.) of excess fat can add 40 to 80 days to the main fasting time. The main fasting usually takes from 1 to 40 days; in most cases the longer the more advantages for the body. Every short fasting is good for the body, but more advantageous is a fast lasting for at least 14 days — the minimum time needed by the body to manifest lasting health changes. 21 days even better! If you have never fasted, it is worth to first exercise it. The first fast can last for only 1 day. After a few days you can fast for 2 or 3 days and nights. Make a break for a week and then fast for 3- 5 days. You can repeat such 3- 5 days fasting for a few times, till you will feel that they are nothing extraordinary for you and you can easily fast longer. Then try 5 or even 7 days fasting. Extend the next fasts, e.g. 7, 9, 10, 12 days and nights or differently, according to your own feeling, till you reach 14 days. Once you reach 2 weeks (or earlier) most probably you will feel that you are able fast for a few weeks. Fasting for 7 weeks (also shorter) may cause “miracles” for heath. Biologically rejuvenates the body — a fact experienced clinically, visually and via the mood. It removes almost all illnesses (some, for example, neglected cancer may need more than one fast), smooths out wrinkled skin, restores the natural color and strength to the hair and stops hair losing (hair may start to grow anew), beautifies the body. People who fasted for health talk with convict ion to the others about many advantageous mental and psychical health changes they've experienced. “I never imagined that I could feel so good.” “If you have not experienced this, you do not know, what the true good health is, even if you have been feeling very well.” — These and similar opinions may be heard. There is one serious danger, which may make the body to stop working (die) — fear. The social suggestion (in which most people on Earth live) inculcated in the mind a belief (program) that man has to eat and that fasting harms the body. Well, if you believe this, do not start 40 days fasting right away, because if you do, the body may stop working earlier, just because of the belief. You better first exercise fasting in order to see (experience) for yourself that such beliefs result from insufficient basic knowledge about how human body works. FASTING WITH JUICES (JUICE DIET) As for fasting with juices, the healing process goes not so fast and effectiv e as during the dry and water fasting, but one of the advantages of juice diet with raw fresh made juices is that its duration can be unlimited . Even the people with not enough body weight can perform fasting with juices for very long time and not be afraid to face emaciation. "},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 63 A COMMENTARY ON WATER FAST ING Brief review : There are TREE main PHASES for cleansing your body from toxins during water fasting: 1) The period of not eating (you drink only water) – during this phase the body is releasing toxins from the damaged cells and tissues and is preparing t o remove them. 2) The period of drinking fruit juices ( THIS IS THE MAIN PHASE which is more important than the pervious one!) – during this period the body is removing all the toxins that has been released. 3) The period of recovery (you drink any juices and start eating raw fruits, vegetables) – during this period the body builds a better, healthier version of itself. All this will be explained in more details. PHASE 1: WATER FASTING FOR HEALING How to fast ? It looks simple – you just stop eating, and star t drinking pure water (as Paul Bragg recommends, and he is absolutely right on this !). It is better to drink living water. Living water comes out from the ground (it is water from wells and springs. If you live in the city and the access to clean pure water is hindered, you can use a little bit of mineral water adding it to distilled water. Distilled water is pure and mineral water adds some living properties into it ). What to expect during the fasting process? During the whole process of fasting the per son drinks distilled water and after three weeks of fasting she/ he will have a feeling of lightness, liveliness and good mood. This will be the signs meaning that the body is clean and it is the right time to finish fasting. The feelings of lightness, l iveliness and a good mood are good signs of a clean body, but they are subjective. Objective signs are the following: absence of a thin coat on your tongue and clean clear eyes. What diseases can be cured by fasting? The answer is simple – all of them! All of the existing diseases and all of the diseases that are yet to come . Why? Because in the case of fasting we give our body a chance to become its own surgeon and remove all the weak and damaged cells and tissues delicately , with precise accuracy, n ot harming other parts of the body ."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 64 You should be aware that most of the diseases that appear during aging are result of constant intoxication. In each case the symptoms will be different : one person gets asthma , the other one heart problems, the third one cancer or something else, and so on. During fasting the body decomposes all pathogenic tissues and cells, dissolves them and removes them together with toxins. The body possesses the supreme wisdom to be able to recognize pathogenic cells and tissues and to destroy them. All we need is to give it a chance to perform this job. THE TYPES OF TOXINS There are two types of toxins: 1) water -soluble and 2) fat- soluble So, the ways of their elimination from the body are also different. Kidneys , salivary gland s, lungs and gastrointestinal tract remove water -soluble poisons (that is why you have a bad taste in your mouth while fasting and a feeling of slight nause a. It is more complicated to remove fat- soluble poisons. Liver, its bile and your skin are respons ible for it. Now we can make some practical conclusions: - Take warm showers at least once in 2- 3 days to wash away fat -soluble toxins from your skin. Fat -soluble poisons being eliminated by bile from liver go right into intestine. That is why during fasting there is a large amount of “dirty bile” (dark bile), even if you do not eat and there is no food in your duodenum . In that period large amounts of dark bile go directly into intestine constantly . So, those fat -soluble toxins, being removed by the liver, go directly into your intestine. There is no need for you to store them there while fasting. Do not wait until they will be absorbed by your intestine walls and will go back to your tissues. This is one of the main reasons to wash the intestine whi le fasting. Some people advise to do enemas every day. Though, you can make them not so often, for example, once in 4- 5 days. It depends on your general state. If you can not bear them at all, do enemas at least 1 time a week. WARNING! It is highly important to wash the large intestine right before you resume eating!!!! If you start eating without washing the intestine, all the toxins that are mobilized in the intestine and are ready to be removed will be absorbed by the walls of your intestine together with the food you eat and will go back to the tissues and cells. "},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 65 *** In 1926 George Osler Johnson decided to hike from Chicago to New York with no food, consuming only water. He started his hike on June 1, 1926. He was walking all the way long accompanie d by a car with his personal physician. Besides that , many doctors were examining his health condition a long the way. Johnson was slim (his height - 178 cm (5.85 ft.), weight - 72 kg (159 lb.). I n 1926 the weather was pretty hot but he managed to cover a di stance of 25 -70 kilometers (15.5- 43.5 miles) a day. He walked the distance of 578 miles for 20 days of his hike. His physician stated that during that time he was consum ing no food at all. At finish his weight was 54 kilograms (119 lb.), thus he lost 18 kilograms (39.7 lb.) of weight. After the hike his health state was better than before. This officially registered hike is one of the most documented one. It was a serious test for a patient during the healing fasting. WHY 21 DAYS? As a course of treatm ent it is optimal to fast 21 - 28 days . Why ? People who practice fastings agreed to call fastings that are less than 10 days as short fastings; and those fastings that are longer than 10 days are called long fastings. But taking into consideration physiological processes in the body this division is conventional and does not reflect anything. How long does it take the body to heal any injury ? For example, someone breaks his leg . For how long the person will stay with a plaster ? At least three weeks . Usually the body needs three weeks to heal . Three weeks or 21 days is an optimal period for healing fastings too . Within 3 weeks of fasting a human organism has enough time to cleanse the body and to launch regenerative processes. Why is it so? Because we have special cells in our blood called phagocyte s – they need exactly this period of time to do their job. Thus, it would be more correct to consider those fastings that are less than 21 days as short, and those fastings, longer than 21 days as long. So , fastin gs longer than 21 days are truly healing fastings . What if it’s less than 21 days ? For sure, even 1 day fast is good . The difference is in its effect . In most cases , after three weeks of fasting the body destroys the very CAUSE of the disease, about which our medicine has no notion. This is the difference, and this difference is fundamental. But I do not recommend you to fast longer than 21 days, if it’s your first time! E ven to the people who are not old yet . The fastings that are less than 21 days will not give you the maximum effect, but if you fast longer it can be risky. If it’s your first time and you do not have experience in fastings, do not fast longer than 21 days! One more argument in favor of long fastings: the hardest thing is to start. Once you’ve started it is easier to fast for the whole period of 21 days, than make 3 different fastings for 7 days. The effect of these 3 short fastings will be smaller than the effect of one 21 day fasting . But , if you are more than 45 years old or if you are seriously ill, I DO NOT RECOMMEND YOU to fast longer than 10- 14 days. It will be an excessive toxic load for your eliminative organs. "},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 66 Be sure, no matter how much toxins there is in your body , they will never be released in your blood in a huge amount simultaneously. It will be happening gradually . The body tries to maintain the average concentration of toxins in the blood, not to harm itself. It will release the next portion of toxins as soon as the previous one has been eliminated. That is why for f ull elimination of toxins you will need months or even a couple of years. Juicing and raw vegan diet is the best choice in this case. GENERAL REMARK S: long water fasting (or in combination with dry fasting) is suitable for relatively healthy people. As f or those whos e body is emaciated, it is better to improve their health first: - eliminate all cooked food, all animal food (meats, dairy products ) and all food rich in starch from your diet . - eliminate bad habits, like smoking, drinking alcohol and other popular drinks. Eat fresh fruits and fresh self -made fruit juices. It is better not to mix different kinds of food (why? it will be explained below). If you wish you can add herbal juices to your diet. - cleanse your intestine with enema (do not forget that your intestine is THE LARGEST endocrine and immune organ in your body. When it’s clean and works properly your immune system and the balance of hormon es will improve drastically). As for fastings, even a weak and emaciated person can fast for 36 hour s 1 or 2 times a week. These short fastings are pretty safe and will be beneficial anyway. Evening time is the best time to start a 36 hours fasting. You just need to skip your supper and wash the large intestine. The fasting will go fast. PHASE 2 and 3: RESUMING EATING After fasting it is important to know the proper way to resume eating. Even if the first fasting you did not reach the desired health state, do not worry. Next time, with yet bigger experience, with more clean body and its power it will go better , easier and faster . Resumption of eating again is quite a risky process, it should be done carefully. The process of rebuilding the body after starving can be compared to accelerated growth of a baby body. First of all this means that the body builds itself mainly on what it eats. So if the person eats other substances than the body needs, his/her body material structure will be weaker (worse) than the ideal one. A body build in this way is weaker, gets ill easier, wears and ages faster. Resu ming eating has 2 phases : 1) PHASE 2: cleansing your blood from toxins (fruit juices ) 2) PHASE 3: rejuvenation ( all kinds of juices plus fruits) "},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 67 PHASE 2: FRUIT JUICES So , you have already finished your 21 – 28 day fasting , now it’s time to terminate it and res ume “eating ”. It does not matter if you have achieved the desired result or not . You need to remember one thing : the way you resume eating will define the whole result of your fasting. In this regards, I can say that PHASE 2 of your cleansing process (when you terminate fasting and resume eating) IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE FASTING ITSELF . If you can not provide yourself with proper conditions for termination of your fasting, then do not start fasting at all! Water fasting is a too serious method to be treated irresponsibly. If you do not have fresh fruits for juicing, then find them, even if it will take you a couple of days. Have you noticed that I’m not mentioning any food at all? The period of termination of fasting and resuming eating categorically excludes any food it a traditional understanding of the word “food”. Right after the 7 th day of fasting your blood carries a huge amount of toxins. Besides, there is a huge amount of toxins in the tissues that are ready to be removed, they are in a mobiliz ed state. These are the toxins that the body has already mobilized but has not had enough time to eliminate. So, the main task of PHASE 2 is to eliminate these mobilized poisons and not let them go back to the tissues and cells. If you do not pay attenti on to the second phase and start eating, all the toxins circulating in the blood will return back to the deposits and you will not achieve the maximum effect of your fasting. So, do not spoil your own healing process and be consistent . But anyway, you do not have to worry about the toxins that have been released and removed from the body during the fasting. We are not talking about them right now. You already have achieved some positive results of fasting . Now you should take care of those toxins that are still in your blood, they are large in number , maybe their amount is even larger than the amount of toxins that has been removed already . So, in this part we will discuss how to get rid of these toxins from your blood. How to terminate fasting After 21-28 days of not eating any hard food can cause closed- loop obstruction and a need of a surgery. Why so? After 14 days of not eating your intestine enters a relaxation mode and stops producing so called peristaltic waves (contractions) that serve to move down portions of food along the intestine. So , after 14 days the intestine is “immobile” . It will need some time to launch its peristaltic function. If it was a long fasting (more than 14 days) it can take a week for the intestine to go back to full functi oning. I’m sure that now, when the main job has been done, you do not need any complications. "},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 68 Then listen and remember: SELF -MADE FRESH FRUIT JUICES IS ALL THAT YOU CAN CONSUME WHILE RESUMING EATING!!! The number of days you drink juices sho uld be defined by the number of days of your fasting. So, if it was a 7-10 days fasting , you can start eating fresh raw fruits right away (no vegetables, no cooked food!) If it was a 14 days fasting, then you should drink fruit juices and fruit juices only for 7 -10 days. If it was 4 weeks, than you should drink fresh fruit juices for 2 weeks, at least – 4 weeks is even better. An American writer Arnold De Vries who wrote one of the best books about fasting ( “Therapeutic Fasting ”, 1949) gave a little bit different time frames for the fruit juices’ period. De Vries shrinks this period to minimum, but my wide experience tells me that if you spare time for this juicing period you will minimize the effect of cleansing drastically. You have already performed suc h a huge work, it is better to pay more attention to the quality and not to the time spent. Do not rush. Moreover , drinking fresh juices is absolutely safe and pleasant. My own experience shows that you should multiply the terms mentioned by De Vries by tw o, at least. This way you will get the maximum results . When you start drinking fruit juices you will still have a bad taste in your mouth. It is common because the elimination of the toxins is in process. Approximately, after 7 days of drinking juices y ou will start feeling much better and stronger. This will mean that your blood became cleaner and has less toxins in it. What are the other vivid signs if you perform termination process correctly? If you drink only fruit juices you won ’t have problems with voracious appetite which can be a big problem in cases when people terminate fasting not correctly and resume eating hard food right away, and especially cooked food. I warn you — do not fall into voracious appetite — drink only fresh fruit juices . And you will see that after fasting, you will feel full even after drinking just a half of a glass of juice. Avoid juices that contain lots of starch (like bananas , melons, water melons). Food or juices full of starch stop the cleansing process and all the toxins circulating in blood go back to the tissues where they’ve been before. The products with high concentration of starch effectively block the cleansing process. BUT! A molecule of a cooked starch stops the cleansing process at all. So, drink only those fresh fruit juices that have a small amount of starch. After 7-14 days of drinking fresh juices you will feel how your life energy slightly returns back. "},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 69 What kind of juices and fruits are better during this period? The champions among the frui ts are lemon and pineapple. You can also drink all citrus juices (orange, tangerine, pomelo, grapefruit. It is simple to make fresh citrus juices . You cut them in two and squeeze using the most simple manual (hand) juicer. It’s better not to use rotary jui cers for citruses. When you squeeze citruses with a rotary juicer the juicer will produce tiny fibres that you will drink together with juice. And these fibres are useless for your intestine right now (especially if your fasting was longer than 14 days and your intestine is “immobile”). You can also drink apple juices. But try to avoid American apples, please. They are of a very bad quality . Besides chemicals, used for their storage, the producers use radiation. Did you know about it? Grape juice is good too , but not preferable (there is more glucose in it). In Russia , if it’s summer, you can use berries, there are lots of them. But as for The USA, forget about them if they are not organic. All the fruits and vegetables I have been eating in the United St ates just have a form without a content (or their content is full of pesticides). And that is sad. It is very favorable to make pineapple juices. They have proteolytic enzymes that help to eliminate toxins from the body. One pineapple a day is optimal dur ing this period of cleansing. As for papaya , it is less effective . Once again, to be more definite: during the PHASE 2, when you are removing toxins from your blood and body, you should drink only fruit juices with lack of starch . The juices made of carrots or beets , or celery you will be able to add to your menu later, during the PHASE 3 . Roots (juices made of roots) have a high concentration of starch. Starch is very similar to human glycogen – it is a source of glucose. Glucose is a powerful substa nce that starts the processes of synthesis . For us right now it means that all the toxins from the blood will be returned back to the tissues and cells and with a help of glucose will be built back into our body. And we are trying to avoid it right now - so that is why DO NOT DRINK juices rich in starch. The juices made of roots you will add later so they would help you to rejuvenate your body after the cleansing process. One more fact about starch : it raises appetite and can provoke voracious appetite - and this is not what you need right now too. Fruit juices low in starch do not provoke voracious appetite, thus you can drink only one glass of juice and feel wonderful (well, of course you can drink as much and as often as you need, but probably you won’t need much : -) ). "},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 70 Herbal juices . Herbs are abundant in chlorophyll, which is the champion among all the substances with a property of synthesis. The same , as glucose , chlorophyll launches the processes of synthesis in our body . You do not need it right now , that is why you put the herbs aside, leaving them for the third phase. Fresh herbal and root juices are very healthy and effective, you’ll drink them later, when you will finish cleansing your blood from toxins. Right now , during the PHASE 2 you shou ld drink only those juices that possess cleansing abilities to remove the toxins. And again, if you start drinking green juices that are good for synthesis and rejuvenation, you will return part of the toxins back to the tissues and cells. The body will try to resist it and you may feel not very good after drinking herbal or root juices during this period. As for drinking mineral water , it depends on a person. It’s good to drink enough water. As I’ve already mentioned, you may drink distilled water mixed with some mineral water. As for milk , yogurts , porridges, potatoes, other cooked food – FORGET ABOUT IT! It is a serious matter , do not turn it into a silly and dangerous parody. Never drink any juices you can buy in the stores or supermarkets. Do not fool yourself, it is not juices, it is chemical poisons. They are that kind of juices that are good enough to wash your toilet bowel. Yes, if you pour them out into your toilet sink it will be more beneficial for your health than to drink them. PHASE 3: HURRAH! ALL KINDS OF JUICES PLUS FRUITS ! Now when you have been drinking only fruit juices for some certain number of days it is time to include other kinds of fruit, vegetable and herbal juices to your diet. It is time to recreate your body in a new grander version of itself! Start juicing your favorite fruits, herbs and vegetables: carrots, beets, celery, dill, wheatgrass e.t.c. . (well, if you like them, of course). Moreover , in this PHASE you can start eating them ! After a period of drinking only fruit juices for 7-10 days you can start eating fruits and try some vegetables . Now the functions of your intestine are at full capacity. In the beginning you may experience discomfort in gums while eating hard vegetables, if so, drink juices and eat mostly sof t fruits – your gums need time to readjust. And yes, now you can eat melons, water melons and bananas that are rich in starch. And once again I want to remind you that the main part of healing fasting is not the fasting itself, when you drink only water (it is just a preparatory period for mobilization of"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 71 your toxins), but the second part of it, the period of fruit juicing! That ’s when the miracles happen! During the period of juicing and eating fruits and vegetables you have removed toxins from your tissues, cells and blood. Besides that, you have also normalized water balance in the tissues of your body. During the first PHASE it was moved towards dehydration. Within a few days of juicing the body gains 5- 7 lb. of weight due to the replacement of liquids in the organism. Now when you have started drinking vegetable juices (probably carrot juice is the most delicious one among vegetable juices) I would recommend you, if it is possible, to find black radish ! There is no need to juice it, just r ub it with a rubbing board and eat. It can produce a miraculous effect. And I will explain you why : during the whole period of water fasting your body has a strong acidosis (meaning that the balance in your body is moved towards acids (they help to dissolve salts and toxins deposited in the tissues of your body). During the period of fruit juicing , especially if you were drinking mostly citrus juices and pineapple juices, this acidosis continued. What is good about black radish, it is the most alkaline vege table you’ll be able to find. It is one of the most effective natural neutralizers of acids. That is why black radish is very popular for curing rhinitis , bronchitis, quinsy and so on. You may prolong this third PHASE of your raw vegan diet for as long as you wish. Raw vegan diet is ideal human food of a full value. Many people make it a part of thei r lifestyle . And I wish you to do the same. In this case you will be a raw vegan or a fruitarian (if your food will be mostly fresh fruits). There are millions of such people all over the world. And it is not only healthy for your own health, it is very humane and ethical - it is healthy for our planet. 90% of all the problems of our civilization we face today would be solved by only one change – a change for our true diet. For more information you can visit social network fruitarians.net . There you ’ll find lots of valuable information and meet new wonderful people who chose to eat food destined for humans. I’m sure they will be glad to share their own experiences. "},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 72 A FEW WORDS ABOUT FOOD QUALITY IN THE USA I’m sorry to say that, but in the United States I faced a huge problem with raw veganism. The problem is that all of the fruits and vegetables, and even those that are considered to be raw and fresh, undergo radiation treatment in radiation cameras. They do it to ki ll all the bacteria and “prevent” fast spoiling of the products. That is why fruits and vegetables in the USA can not be called living food, even if they look so. Let’s take an avocado as an example. We think it is raw and natural. But let ’s look at what happens to it before we buy it. First of all our avocado is exposed to radiation treatment , after that it is exposed to deep freezing and only after that it is delivered to the customer. When it is placed on a shelf of your supermarket it starts unfreezing slowly. Would you call this avocado a living food after all that? Of course not! In the world where the money is the ultimate value there is so called «science » that serves advertising and sales . Health of people in this kind of system is the last thing that matters , if matters at all. In the USA all of the fruits and vegetables are exposed to radiation treatment. All the potatoes are radioactive. All the fruits and berries have one and the same taste, a taste of wet paper, and we think that we eat real f ruits and vegetables - that is what they tell us from TV. That is why when I have a rare chance to visit Russia I go to their markets, buy and eat as much as I can. The food loses life power and its properties after being exposed to radioactive treatment . But what is even more dangerous , such food accumulates free radical s and pathological fragments of molecules that lead to diseases. Here I’m talking about radiation only. And I’m not even talking about negative influence of chemical treatment, pesticides and GMO (genetically modified organism s). The USA is the leader for producing and consumption of GMO products. To sum it up : PHASE 2 ( a period of fresh fruit juices) is more important and more productive for removal of toxins than the water fasting itsel f, which in its essence is just a preparatory phase for mobilization of toxins from their deposits. And again: there are three main phases for elimination of toxins during water fasting : 1) PHASE 1: MOBILIZATION. Water fasting (healing fasting). Dura tion period: 1-4 weeks. 2) PHASE 2: ELIMINATION. Fresh fruit juices that have no starch in them . Duration period: the same number of days or weeks as in your previous phase. 3) PHASE 3: REJUVENATION. All kinds of juices plus RAW fruits , vegetables , berr ies , herbs . Duration period: At lest 1 -4 weeks. But it will be even better for you to make it a part of your lifestyle. Thus , as you can see , one week of a water fasting turns into a 3 week process after which you will become a new person! : -) "},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 73 THE OTHER HELPFUL TOOLS THAT ARE BENEFICIAL DURING FASTING MUSCLE MOVEMENTS Many people, who are fasting or adapting the body for living without food, complain about considerable weakness of the body, which may be accompanied by muscle pain. These people feel very weak, therefore doing any physical work tires them more than before . Doing such a simple act as moving a heavy object, becomes a big effort, causing a short breath and leg trembling to these people. Such weakness of the muscles requires exercising. When the muscles have too little movement, they atrophy. When a person is fasting or forcible adapting the body for living without food, the atrophy is much faster, if the person do es not exercise the muscles regularly. The body, cons idering the muscles less needed, “eats” them as a source of protein. Therefore, if you want the muscle mass to remain, know that this needs regular exercising. It is more advantageous when the exercises do not tire the body too much, so no forcing. Let the muscle exercises to be moderate and regular in time. Instead of bending the knees a hundred times and pressing -up thirty times at once, stagger them to five sessions in one day. Jogging and moderate swimming are also very beneficial for the muscles. When the body knows that you need your muscles and you use them often, it will adjust itself to the other sources of energy and building matter (air, water etc.). Besides this, w hen you are active during fasting, all the metabolic processes in the body, including it’s cleansing will go faster. So it’s more than beneficial to exercise during fasting. Energizing exercises mentioned earlier are very beneficial for the muscles and the whole body . I have mentioned that the energizing exercises do not tire the body, they just make the muscles to work gently, and this clearly makes them stronger. It is worth to know some techniques and even try them, but you do not have to become a student of yoga or any school. You can exercise alone (even with a manual) or rely on your feeling of the body and the energy flow, which induce the muscles to move (I mentioned it earlier). In this case the most important is the movement of the muscles, which will not allow them to atrophy, which will strengthen them and give the body more energy. To do the exercises esthetically perfect is much less important in this concern. ALTERNATE SHOWER The alternate shower is started with warm water. After a moment the temperature of the water is gradually raised to the hottest that you can stand (of course, do not exaggerate). Then quickly decrease the water temperature to the coldest you can stand — let it fall on all your body for more than ten second. Next, quickly change the water temperature again,"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 74 to hottest that you can easily stand, and let it flaw on the b ody for a few tens of seconds. And again, quickly make the water coldest you can easily stand. Repeat a few times the quick change of the water temperature. The last one is the cold water which should fall on the body, in order to close the skin pores and activate the energy flaw from the inside to the outside (it makes you feel warm). The alternate shower cleans (unstop) the capillary blood veins and the skin. Because of the big and quick changes in water temperature the capillary blood veins alternately expand and shrink quickly. This causes the excess minerals and other substances, covering the internal side of the blood veins, to peel. The same quick water temperature changes make the skin pores expand and shrink alternately. Such movements eject the excess of the sebum with the dirt. Thanks to this there is no need to use soap or other skin washing substances (you do not poison the body and nature). Ending the alternate shower with hot water is practiced in cases, when the person goes to bed (even wit hout drying the skin) directly from the shower, in order to make the body perspire a lot. A person feels cold when exiting from a shower finished with cold water. But very soon the cold causes higher energetic activity in the body. Just a few moments after drying the skin one can feel the energy warming the body. This can be felt especially well if after the shower you do energizing exercising or just some gymnastic. In this case it is even better if you do not dry the skin but start the exercising right after finishing the shower. Instead of a shower one can use two bath tubs. One contains cold and the other hot water. You enter the tubes alternately, submerge once in the cold and once in the hot water, for a few tens of seconds. Finish this in the cold w ater. If hot water is not available, have the courage sometimes to take a cold shower or a bath in ice -cold water. It may very favorably influence the body especially when you are tired or have a cold. This is a good method for strengthening the immune sy stem. However, for some people, who almost always feel cold, this may be not the best idea. VISUALIZATION A POWERFUL TOOL FOR REPROGRAMMING YOUR INSTINCTS DURING HUNGER CURE Visualization is one of the simplest and most efficient methods used for reprog ramming the instinct. It is a conscious action which brings planned changes in the work of the body and in the life circumstances. If you want to make the body ill or healthy, make yourself rich or poor, develop certain ability in yourself etc., you can use this visualization. If this visualization was compared to programming and you were compared to the programmer, then life is a game which you are writing according to your preferences. For the visualiz ation to be effective (that is, the result of the reprogramming is noticeable), the right picture (film) has to be created and saturated with energy. The following five conditions, which need to be fulfilled, describe the details: "},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 75 1.A clear, realistic and vivid picture or film, in which details are perceived by all the senses. 2.The achieved result, in the present time. 3.Feeling the state of the result being achieved. 4.Knowing that this is the reality. 5.The energy accompanying Love. Re . 1: First an d foremost, know what you want, that is what is the final result that you have decided. See all the detail of the thing that you have decided and which is going to be produced as the result of the visualization. Create a picture in which also the senses work. The more senses take part in the picture, the more realistic and vivid is the picture — the easier it is to accomplish the visualization. For example, if the result of the visualization is to have your own house, imagine yourself living in this house with your family. See all of you speaking (the sense of hearing) near the house and how you invite friends to visit it etc. Let the smell of the freshly painted walls, flowers of the garden, be around there (the sense of smell). You can also taste a freshl y prepared drink in the kitchen (the sense of taste). Outside the house you feel the nice warmth of the afternoon Sun. Such a picture becomes a film in your imagination. Create only those details in the picture, which are important for you. The rest of the details will be created accordingly, so you do not need to care. For example, if the location and the shape of the house are important to you, then clearly create these details in the picture. But if the number of the windows and the colors of the walls are not so important to you, do not create them at all in the picture. Do not include the way of achieving the final result (unless it is the way that interests you most or even is the final result) in the picture that you are creating. The picture itself , that is the final result of the visualization, is important, not the way of achieving it. If you are creating in the picture a way of achieving the final result, you are limiting yourself by this way. There are other ways that you are not aware of, which are more efficient, easier and advantageous etc. So you would be better off creating the final result in your imagination and not thinking about the ways of achieving it. For example, if you have decided to heal your body, then see yourself happy and com pletely healthy. Do not imagine any method to heal yourself. IAM has much more efficient methods, compared to what the intellect is able to imagine. Re. 2: The result presented in the picture created in your imagination has to exist in the present time. I f in the imagination you say, for instance, “will” have, become, receive, buy, become or other “will” (using the future tense) — it will become a fact. Therefore, today it “will” be to be attained, tomorrow it “will” be to be attained, after a year it stil l “will” be to be attained, after twenty years nothing will be changed because it still “will” be to be attained ... So till when “will it”, “will be”? The visualization gives you what you have created. Since you have created “it will” (future happening), you will always have the thing in the future, never “having done” it. In other"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 76 words, the result of the visualization will never be attained in the present time. Since you are living in the present, always, you will never receive what you visualize to be r ealized in the future. Re.3 The picture created in the imagination has to present the result already realized, the goal already attained. For you it is already the present reality. As for the above example — you see and feel yourself in the house as reali stically as if you were living in it. You are living, sleeping, working, resting in the house — you treat everything as really existing, occurring in the present time. The instinct is not very good at dealing with the illusion of the intellect called “time”, it does not know what the time is. It understands and reacts as a small child. If you tell the child “today”, “tomorrow”, “after one week”, he/she will not distinguish the significant difference, because his/her intellect has not learned to create the t ime. This is one of the main reasons why the picture has to present the desired state as already materialized. You are already now seeing and feeling it as the real state of the matter. Re.4 Do you know what is the difference between “to know” (knowledge) and “to believe” (belief)? I have already mentioned this. Well, when you know something, you do not believe it. When you believe something, you also doubt it, because you just do not know it. Not clear? Let me ask you. Do you know or do you believe that y ou are reading this book? What is your answer? “I know that I am reading.” or “I believe that I am reading.” Do you now comprehend the difference? Looking for advices about how to do visualization, one can find information that says “you have to strongly believe”, because “the believing moves mountains”. Well, no matter how strong you believe something, at the same time you are also doubting it. But when you know, you have no doubts. Another example. If somebody now called you and asked what you were doing . You, according to the fact, may answer that you are reading a book. You know it, but the other party may only believe you. He/she can believe what you said 99.99%, not 100%. If the other party could see you now, he/she would be able to say: “know”. The visualization requires you to know that the picture in your imagination presents the already materialized reality in the present time. You may doubt if you are able to know. In such a case you think that you are able to only believe strongly. Well, then believe it. It is more advantageous than to do nothing or to move it to the future. Re.5 Without sufficient amount of energy the visualization will not give the result. The amount of the required energy is not as big as results from the e=mc2 formula, because the thing does not concern this formula. Therefore, when I talk about the energy here I relate less to the known definition stating that the energy is a potential capable of performing work. What I mean by “energy” is the thing that a person feels under the influence of an emotion. An emotion is a reaction of the instinct (so it is a program), occurring when energy is suddenly released or blocked (e-motion = energy in motion) . Do you recall any past moment, when you were “hair -raising” frightened and your heart almost “jumped out”? Then recall the energy which captured you in that moment. Also recall the energy which stirred you, when you were feeling the strongest love affection of"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 77 your life. Now you probably know what I am referring to, when I say that the visualization needs “energy”. So you have the picture ready, which is totally real and exists in the present time. You also know that the picture represents your present reality. Now you only need the energy, in order to manifest the picture in the ( material) world. So now allow yourself to feel the most powerful energy, the one appearing when emotions accompanying Love arise. First allow Love to manifests itself through you. Just let this happen by itself. You need to do nothing except allowing, beca use you are the source of Love. In the visualization the picture can be compared to a seed put in the soil. The energy arising with the emotions is compared to the Sun and water. The seed without water and Sun would never grow into the plant. How to do i t practically? First concentrate on yourself, relax. Allow Love to manifest itself through you (the mind and body). When you are feeling the rising energy accompanying Love, bring the picture (with all the attributes as described above) into your imaginati on (mind). In this moment the more Love manifests itself through you, the more efficient (earlier, easier) the visualization gives the result. SYMPTOMS When referring to a symptom here I mean a usually unpleasant reaction of the body or psyche caused by the changes in nourishment. When you are changing the diet or fasting, some symptoms may appear, especially if this is done quickly. Maybe this part is not interesting very much, but I should write about too, so you would have mor e complete info. Writing about symptoms herewith, by mentioning the word “fast” I refer to either or all of the following situat ions: diet change, heal fasting, living long terms without food etc. . The following descriptions are quite general and they have exceptions, because every person is a different world. General description, recommendations and procedures are not completely suited for most people, thus it is advisable to consider them as frames only. Treating every person individually gives the best results, conclusions and indications. The intuition is the best adviser. If you can hear it well, you need no advices. If you cannot yet, then judgment is your best adviser. Descriptions below may have a bunch of valuable information. First of all, do not fight against the body. Fighting results in casualties. When you fight against the body, who is the casualty? Instead, Love your body and keep it in discipline. I will not describe all the symptoms here, only those experienced most often. Many things may occur because every person reacts in a different manner. If you are not afraid, there is very small probability that something endangering your life will happen. Properly conducted fasting never causes any illness. If you have any doubts during fasting, stay in touch with a c ompetent person. The best is to be in touch with a doctor, who is experienced enough in healing by fasting. It results from my observation that no more than one percent of doctors have sufficient knowledge"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 78 about heal fasting. Even among those doctors who prescribe fasting for healing there are some who some times give harmful recommendations. Of course, it is better to find such doctor instead of falling into hands of another one, who would know nothing or too little about this most efficient physical heal ing method known on Earth. The symptoms listed below are temporary, they last from a few seconds to a few weeks maximum; they may manifest constantly or in bouts, changing intensity. Some people almost do not notice them, so they have no relating problems . However there are persons who feel so overwhelmed that it seems to them they may be dying. But with most people, who are generally regarded as having “normal heath”, only some symptoms appear for a short time. The observed regularity makes for a general rule that the more ill is the person, the more symptoms may appear, they will last longer and be more ailing .

When fasting (or in other life situations) there is nothing more frightening than the fear itself, which also becomes the biggest danger for the fasting person. If you are afraid to f ast — either do not do i t or do it with a person whom you trust so much that you lose your fear. There are so many people who having been suddenly deprived of food, died just after a few days, when the real fasting process had not even started. Forcing a person to fast, when he/she is afraid of fasting, is dangerous for the body life, not because of the lack of food, but solely because of their fear. If you start to feel fear during your fast, then the more you fear for your health and life because of the fast, the sooner you should stop fasting. Fear about other things also has the power to damage. The human is more sensitive when fasting, so any fear may cause more damage. Fear is the state of complete absence of Love (the power creating Life). This state causes Life to vanish. Therefore, the less Love manifests itself through a being, the more the being feels the lack of energy creating Life, thus the being feels more fear. So if you feel"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 79 fear, it means that you inhibiting / suppressing Love, the only s ource of life for your mind and body. If you allow Love, of which precisely your are the source, to manifests itself more, then fear will vanish. Fear and Love never co -exist. If you decide to get rid of the approaching fear, you may use this exercise, whi ch frees Love from within you. Sit or lay down in a relaxed position and make yourself silent. Breathing freely and calmly concentrate on feeling Love, of which you are the source and which naturally emanates from you. Feel that in the center of the being that you are, the source of your life is present. This source always emanates as intensively as your mind allows it. So now let it manifest itself fully. Let it shine like a sun, warming the whole of you and the surrounding. Allow completely, and feel L ove. Feel, feel ... how Love overwhelms you and everything around you. Do not create Love, do not create something of which you are the source – Love manifests itself if you just allow it. WEAKNESS A feeling of physical weakness is one of the most common symptoms. One can even say that to feel weak is normal. Some people strongly bounded to eating (addicts) feel weakness after just a few hours of fasting. This feeling of weakness indicates that the body began to feel the difference in delivery of nourishment in form of food. The rhythm is disturbed so the body starts to react. In one group of people the weakness may never happen (this is rare), in another group it happens once or just a few times during the whole fast, for the third group the weakness is a full time companion. Regardless of the cause and duration, the weakness indicates low level of life energy of the person in question. How to deal with this? Well, it depends on the situation and the person. If somebody is too active physically, it is better for him/her to rest or even to lie down. Also the opposite may happen, that somebody is resting, sitting, not moving all day — then he/she should go for a walk, cycle a little, swim, exercise. During fasting time mild physical and energizing exercise s are highly recommended. The movement and better energy flow allows the body to clean itself deeper and faster. Doing energetic and exhausting exercises is not recommended. Moderate gymnastics and exercises, during which the mind is concentrated on feeling the energy instead of making the muscles tired, have much better influence on the body. Isometric exercises, yoga, q i- gong and t aj-ji influence humans very beneficially and are even salutary. It is worthwhile to do them every day except the times when the body clearly needs rest through sleeping. During fasting there may be hours or even entire days when the body feels so weak that the person does not have the strength to walk and he/she feels like doing nothing but resting. These are the times when the body requires rest, preferably sleep. It may be caused by a toxin induced disease. It is good to be able to feel whether the body requires rest or grew lazy and needs exercising. It would be wrong to sleep when the body needs exercising. Exercising would be too big a load when the body needs rest. Judgment and ability to distinguish are valuable qualities of a fasting person. When the real need for resting arises, it is worth to go to bed and sleep. "},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 80 However if this state lasts for too long (say, for over three days) and you do not find any illness in you, it is worth to discipline yourself and do some energizing exercises. Too much of laying down and sleeping makes the body weaker instead of giving it energy, which the person needs so much at this time. The blood pressure goes down, the blood circulates slower, the metabolism slows down. This makes both the eliminations of toxins from the body and the self -healing process slower. In such situation the energizing exercises help a lot and make the person fe el better. If the weakness lasts too long, especially after the first three weeks of fasting are passed (for a person with normal weight), this indicates that the time to resume eating is approaching. But not always, because there may be other reasons, for example, serious illness, lack of fresh air, too high air temperature, too much physical work or weakening agents. So to take the decision whether to stop the fasting or to continue it, depends individually on the cause and the health state of the person . Another major reason for weakness is the release of toxins from cells, tissues and bones during the cleansing period. The toxins go into intestine and if not removed, circulate in the body, causing weakness. Simply wash the large intestine with water to eliminate the toxins, as it’s been described in this section. Mild physical activities help to eliminate toxins too. Exercises or any physical activity helps to overcome weakness. If you walk for 20- 40 minutes, probably you will notice that you are les s weak and tired. DEHYDRATION When you decide to give up drinking, you begin dry fasting or dry non- eating. Statistically the human body can live without water for over a dozen days. For how long you can stay without water, depends on several factors, th e main one being reaction of the instinct, but also air humidity, temperature, physical activity, amount of minerals (that is salt and other substances to be washed out) and fat reserve. The safe period in optimal conditions is about four days. During dry fasting in optimal conditions the body uses between 0,1 and 1 kg of fat to produce water. This is the approximate daily loss of weight. An overweight person can survive longer without any drinks than a thin person, assuming that their bodies are in roughl y similar condition, have similar quantities of minerals to be removed and the persons have same amount of life energy. The body of an overweight person has more fat tissue, which is used to produce water during dry fasting. If a person is not prepared for dry fasting or does it for too long, he/she may dehydrate the body too much. Excessive dehydration causes many abnormalities in the body functions, which may result in its death. Therefore, when dry fasting one needs to check often, whether the body show s signs of too much dehydration. Dehydration level of as little as 2% is clearly felt as strong thirst. When dehydration exceeds 10%, it becomes life threatening and should therefore be warded off. Visions, hallucinations, faltering caused by dehydration c learly indicate that the person is balancing on life edge. In such case one immediately needs to thoroughly hydrate the body as soon as possible. "},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 81 If life threatening occurs, one must immediately drink water, take a bath, pour water into the large intestin e and consult a doctor. Dehydration that went beyond a critical point is irreversible. This means that attempt to hydrate the body does not rectify the situation and the body is incapable of absorbing enough water. This leads to the arrest of bodily funct ions. If you do not have enough experience to ascertain the level of body hydration, you won't know when dehydration becomes dangerous. In this case it is more secure to stay in touch with an expert in this area during your dry fast. DIZZINESS AND FAINTI NG These are frequently experienced symptoms; only a few of those fasting for a long time can say that they had not experienced them. Especially persons with low blood pressure may experience unpleasant situations. These persons need to take special care n ot to allow the blood pressure to fall too much, because it may be hazardous for the proper work of the body. If you are one of these persons, you better start with some fasting training consisting of a series of gradually extended fasts. In this way the body will partly cleanse itself and learn to react with lesser drop in blood pressure. Another solution (not really a good one) is to drink herbs during the fast — in much smaller doses and only when the real need arises. A lot better solution is doing energizing exercises, acupressure, acupuncture, massage and similar treatments that increase the blood pressure. Many people give up fasting because of dizziness and fainting. These symptoms look grave enough to shaken even a self -confident faster and make him/her apprehensive about the state of their body. Dizziness or fainting are not as dangerous as the consequences they entail, so this is where attention must be directed. The most important is to make sure that the person suffering dizziness or fainting do es not fall down because they may wound them selves. Dizziness, ranging from slight to loss of consciousness, is most often caused by too low blood pressure and/or too low blood sugar level. When fasting the body undergoes many truly revolutionary changes . One of the symptoms of these changes is fluctuation of the blood pressure (especially dropping). The lowered blood pressure is mostly felt between the first and the fifth weeks of fasting, with changing intensity. Later, with self -cleaning of the body and its adaptation to living without food, the blood pressure stabilizes at the optimal level for the fasting person. Fluctuating blood pressure episodes may also come later. For each individual it will happen differently and will depend on the amount and t ype of consumed liquids, temperature, atmospheric pressure, among others. Changes in blood pressure per se are not as dangerous as the movements done by the person. For the sake of personal safety, it is very important that the person avoids sudden positi on changes from lying or sitting to standing. When rising, lean against something or support yourself by placing your hands on chair, table etc. and slowly erect the body to the standing position. When you feel dizziness coming, stop rising or sit back. Do not move to fast to avoid blackouts. It is a good idea to learn how to behave at the times of experiencing dizziness with blackouts. Blackout is a symptom of a sudden blood outflow from the brain, causing"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 82 fainting. In this case adopt the low bending posi tion, that is, the head lower than the trunk and the hands put down in front of the head. If you feel worse, squatting will help in most cases, so put your hands firmly on the floor (lean on them) and lower the head down freely between the shoulders. If t he dizziness persists, rest for a while. Lie down and the rise the legs leaning against the wall or a chair. If the fluctuations of the blood pressure persist, cause frequent fainting or last for too long, consider carefully whether you want to continue t he fast and consult a competent doctor. It is also very advisable to check your blood sugar level. NAUSEA AND VOMITING These are common symptoms of the body undergoing self -cleansing process. The body of fasting person does not use energy for digesting, t herefore it can use the energy for self - cleansing. In the process of dissolving and eliminating old concretions, accumulated toxins and excess fat, the body releases different substances into the blood. The blood, circulating through the whole body, passes also through the brain center, which controls nausea and vomiting reactions. So the toxins circulating in the blood cause the unpleasant symptoms, like pain, nausea or even vomiting. Other reasons of such acute reactions may include ulcer, abscess, cyst, improperly healed wound, accumulated and crusted (glued with mucus) substance, tumor — about which the fasting person might even have no knowledge. The body opens all such things and tries to get rid of them in different possible ways. This is the reason why it is better to help the body with fasting in such situations. Starting to eat when such situation arise means stopping the cleansing and hence the healing. As an example let me tell you of the case of a man, about 40 years of age, who in his childhoo d was treated with “medicines” containing mercury compounds. On his 9th day of fasting he suddenly felt so bad, that he fell down and started vomiting. Immediately after this he felt much better. In the vomit he collected a quarter of glass of mercury. The conclusion from this story is that the body accumulated and stored the mercury in his childhood and decades later, during the fast, the body opened the box in order to throw the contents out. Usually there is no big need to be concerned about nausea and vomiting, because waiting from a few hours to a few days (in rare cases) solves the problem. It is helpful to walk in the woods, near a lake or to do some energizing exercises, because movement helps the body to detoxify faster. Also, if you prefer, you c an drink warm water to induce vomiting. If you feel nausea, and your intestine has not been cleaned with water, enema will probably help a lot. If vomiting happens often or if it contains gall or blood, consulting a competent doctor could be useful. It is worth remembering that such vomiting indicates that the body needs longer fasting. After vomiting one feels relief because the body got rid of poison. Then sensible inflow of energy occurs and one feels much better (cleaner inside). WEIGHT LOSS"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 83 Also the process of weight loss, being one of the symptoms, should be considered individually. When an obese person is loses weight, it is a very beneficial process of getting rid of the excess and restoring the proper weight to the body. However, when a person who is already thin is still slimming down, emaciation maybe occurring. In the former to continue the fast is more beneficial for the person. For the latter it is better to start eating again. Also the rate at which weight loss is occurring, is an individual matter. It usually stabilizes after the few first days of fasting. The decreasing weight, occurring in the first fasting days, is primarily caused by the body emptying the intestine and removing the excess water, which is even more noticeable during dry fasting. If, for example, the body loses two pounds a day in the first week of fasting, in the next weeks it may lose only two pounds a week. In some extreme cases the weight loss may be as big as thirty pounds a day — I know of two persons whose bodies res ponded in this way. There are also people whose bodies lost only a few pounds during the whole long fast. So, as you can conclude, there are no strict rules about how and how much body weight has to change during fasting. During dry fasting the daily weight loss of an obese person may amount to two pounds (or more) because excess fat is used faster by the body to produce water. Such rapid loss of weight in a slim or underweight pers on may be hazardous for the body . Experiencing weight loss as well as other symptoms accompanying fasting, first of all one should be guided by reason. Typically a person of normal constitution is able to keep the power of life in the body for up to two months without any food. If the body weight is constantly going down during this time, it clearly shows that the instinct is not yet able to run the body properly without food. A person who constantly sees his/her body as too fat despite it being too thin already, is considered anorexic. Fasting is not for anorexics. These people s hould first address and cure their mental disorders (which are main disease factors causing anorexia). EMACIATION Emaciation can be caused by forcing the body to fast for too long — in such case emaciation is caused by too big loss of the body weight and building material deficiency. Then also the life energy level is too low for the human to function normally. Statistically, in case of a “normally” nourished, not too thin and not too overweight person, fasting for the period of up to seven weeks does no t cause any damage to the body. But after this period the deficiency of the building material may become too big for the body to continue to function well. So, if more than a month has passed and your body is still very weak, you have “no strength” for phy sical activity, you cannot get up from the bed in the morning, you are not emanating happiness and optimism — this is a clear indication that you should end the fast. In the future , after some period of healthy eating you can continue fasting again, and ac hieve even better results. Each next time you fast it will be much easier physically and emotionally. PAIN"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 84 You may feel pain in any area of the body, although it usually does not happen all at the same time. Headache is most frequent, usually appears fi rst. Other aches, in the region of the heart, stomach, liver, kidneys joints, spine, intestine and muscle, may occur at any time and may last from a second to a few days (longer lasting pain is quite rare). Pain during fasting indicates that the body is el iminating the cause of disease in the organ concerned, that is, it repairs it (restores the organ's perfect state and function). So, this is a reason to be happy rather than to be afraid. The bigger the organ's problem, the more it can ache and the longer last the repair. It happens quite often that an organ aches although the fasting person considered it healthy. Until the pain appeared the person was unaware of the organ's disease. The longer the person is fasting, the fewer aches appear — this is the result of the self cleansing and self repairing processes in the body. Other frequent pain causes which happen during fast are physical movements of body organs. During fasting some organs shrink and fat tissues are eliminated. This causes changes in the m uscle tone and the relative position of the body organs. This may be clearly felt especially in the abdomen. Another strong pain may suddenly appear. In such case you may need to consult a doctor. As an example let me relate you another experience of mine . In the fourth month of non- eating I suddenly started to feel a strong, piercing to the point of fainting pain, in the right part of the abdomen and the dorsum. I went to a hospital begging for an imme diate strong analgetic. A fter a few hours of examinati on, the doctor said that it was caused by something which clogged the ureter. My conclusion was that only after four months of non- eating, the stone that I had in my kidney had fallen into the ureter. Because it was larger in size, it caused so much pain w hen moving down. Sometimes you may experience muscle pain (usually it happens during the first week of first fasting), mainly in legs when you walk. The pain resembles the one one might have after excessive exercising in gym . Some people start worrying ab out this pain, thinking their muscles begin to atrophy. There is nothing to worry about, everything is alright with your muscles, the cause of this pain is salt deposits in your body. The tissues start to release these deposits and this is the cause of mus cle pain. Usually, if you’ll make your muscles work (for example, you walk for 5- 15 minutes, when the pain is in legs) you’ll notice that the pain has disappear ed. So as you can see, this or other kind of pain surprises are entirely possible. In some rare situations an unexpected thing may happen that may be dangerous for the health of the body, to which the body will react with a strong pain. In this case it is advisable to consult a doctor. But most often it is not a reason to resume eating. PSYCHIC AL INSTABILITY Among fasting people there are persons who ask me: why so much anger, hatred, irritability etc. manifest itself during fasting? The fasting person wonders where does this huge flaw of negative emotions come from and why. On the other hand f amily members agree that it is difficult to bear such a person. That is plausible because a fasting person going through such a process may be unpredictable. For example, he/she can “without any reason” throw a jam jar against a wall, explode with shouting at another person, burst into tears. The mood of this person may change in an instant. "},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 85 Other fasting persons feel psychical reactions manifesting itself through sadness, resignation, lack of interest in anything. To these people the feeling of “meaninglessness of everything” becomes familiar. On the one hand the person feels like doing nothing, on the other hand the person feels remorse because of his/her laziness, and also sees “the meaninglessness of life”. Some of these people say that they have had en ough of this life, they see it without purpose and they do not want to live any longer or they prefer not to exist at all. The described reactions come to pass because the psyche is being cleansed. Fasting cleanses not only the physical body, it does the same to all other human bodies. Therefore also the mind is cleansed, its toxins come to the surface and blockages get released. By the way, this mind cleansing makes the person to perceive things as they truly are. That's why the person can realize the tr ue sense of life, that is ... that it is just a game, that it has no sense unless you create it in your mind. What can feel a person who just discovered the true sense of life? Another reason for different emotional reactions is increasing sensitivity to stimuli. The fasting person will gradually cleanse his/her bodies and their senses. When the purity of the physical and non- physical senses increases, the level of stimulus required for perception to happen, decreases. Clearer senses are more sensitive for stimuli and they function in a larger spectrum of perception. The person may not be prepared for this, so the usual intensity of stimuli may be too strong. Too strong stimuli may irritate the person. For example, what was perceived as conversation of ordinary/normal loudness until now, during fasting may be perceived as clamor or even shouting; this may irritate. Besides these emotions, the fasting person may experience also the opposite e.g. sudden appearance (i. e. as if without any reason) of happines s, feeling of ease (no- problem - ness) of life, Love emanating from the inside. During fasting different pleasant and unpleasant emotions, accompanied by certain reactions, may appear. It happens differently with each individual. In every case it is benefic ial cleansing process, so it is one more reason to be happy rather than to be worried. If during fasting you experience emotions accompanied by reactions, which you want to get rid of, you can practice the contemplation of Light and Love. It is, in fact, the contemplation of passiveness, in which you prepare yourself for feeling and manifesting Light and Love (of which you are the source in your essence). The more you allow Light and Love to manifest itself through your mind and body, the earlier so called negative emotions will stop tormenting you and the sooner your mind and body will be healed. DIFFERENT REALITY After a few weeks of fasting (or earlier) you may notice that the way you see and understand the world has changed. Also your thinking and acti ng in this world has changed. Some matters, objects and actions have changed their values (in your opinion, of course). "},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 86 There are many possible ways of experiencing this new perception. You look at people and at what they do as if you were watching them i n a theater, because you feel yourself as if you were not present here, as if you were not partaking in the existence of this world. Some things that you used to do and some subjects that you were interested in became unimportant or even worthless, althoug h they used to be valuable and useful to you before. You have the impression that some things you are again learning from the beginning, so activities like driving a car, ironing, typing may be felt as a new experience. Things which used to be done automat ically may now demand special attention — as if you had forgotten how to do them. Other things, which used to require concentration, you can now do easier, they become more natural. You take notice of and pay attention to sights, sounds and smells which did not draw your attention before. You can notice many more psychical changes. You may get the impression that this state is similar to being under drug influence. Generally speaking, the perception and understanding of the reality of the world have chang ed. You may even suspect that something is wrong with your psyche. Your family members and friends may also notice your other “strange” reactions. So what has happened? Many changes have occurred. The parts making up your mind have changed their activities, for example, the intellect became calmer. Also the endocrine glands work differently, for example, more endorphins and less adrenaline are excreted. This state may last for some time, the length of which depends on an individual. It is a good time for observing yourself and learning from it. There is no reason to worry, if the body is not in the state of emaciation or exhaustion. So you can enjoy the new experience. CHANGES ON SKIN The skin is the place where the cleansing and eliminative functions of t he body can be observed. The sebum and sweat contain substances unwanted by the body, which are harmful to it and are therefore eliminated (this is where different odors come from). To put is simply, the skin is linked with the intestine through the liver. There is even a saying that the skin of a person reflects the state of the large intestine and the liver. Of course, the full picture of skin condition consists of more factors. When the body expels a poison, it can do so through the skin, which then reacts with reddening, rash, eczema etc. If a person has skin problems, it is quite likely that they will re-appear when the person is fasting, because the body is getting rid of the toxins which cause the problem. Changes on the skin during fasting may also be caused by an activation of an old disease. However a new disease coinciding in time with the fast may also cause skin changes. In the majority of such cases the best solution will be to continue the fast, so that the disease will leave sooner. Summing up, allergy, rash or other skin problems appearing during the fast are not a reason to stop, but rather to continue f asting . FEELING COLD If you or your relatives have ever fasted, you probably know what it means to feel cold during fasting. Although it is warm outside, the fasting person has cold hands, feet, nose and even ears. The person may even be sniffing as if he/she had a cold. All this happen despite the person being warmly dressed."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 87 The human feels cold not because of insufficient clothes or low temperature. Of course, the society suggestion has formed some human reactions which result in the body feeling “cold” or “warm” depending on the temperature. The main factor in feeling the temperature is the amount and the way of using energy in the hum an body. To put it simply, if there is enough energy the person does not feel cold even if it is frosty outside and, similarly, does not feel hot in the heat. The person will feel well in a much larger range of temperatures. But if energy is lacking, or the person does not know how to use it to control temperature perception, then he/she feels too cold or too hot. You can conclude from this that if during fasting you are suffering because of feeling cold, you can help yourself by concentrating on releasing the internal energy. To make it happen, things like energizing exercises, visualization and alternate shower (with cold and hot water, described below) are useful. Doing them regularly will make the person free from susceptibility to cold. Drinking a lot of hot drinks, is not a good solution. At the time of drinking and shortly afterwards you feel warm, but at the same time the body is loaded with too much water, which overloads the eliminative system. The flow of energy (and resulting susceptibility to temperature) causes what we call feeling cold or warm. You can easily learn that feeling cold or warm is subjective and depends on managing your internal energy. If you concentrate on releasing warmth, after a while you can feel a difference. So when you practice the contemplation of the warmth, this will allow you to reprogram the instinct in the way that will enable you to always feel comfortable regardless of the temperature. The physical factors most affecting your feeling of external temperature are m ainly the functions of the intestine, liver and spleen. So if these organs do not function perfectly, they block the circulation of energy. By simply cleaning the large intestine, which will clean the liver automatically, makes the person feel the energy better, not feel so cold in the winter and perspire less in hot summer. FEVER The body increases its temperature when it is coping (killing, removing) with parasites – this is one of its self defensive functions. As happens during fasting, the body eliminates disease causing loci by opening a concentration of, for example, bacterias. They consequently circulate in the bloodstream through the entire body, causing the fever. So a natural healing process of the human body is taking place. If fever occurs during fasting, usually the best solution is to wait until it is gone. Drink more warm water (no tea, no coffee, no juice), go to bed, rest, sleep more. Usually the body will get well within between a few hours and a few days. To take a drug lowering the body temperature is almost always a mistake, because it harms the body's natural mechanism of temperature control and poisons the body with chemicals. However, when having acute and very high fever, it is advisable to call a doctor with sufficient knowledge about heal fasting. "},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 88 HAIR FALLING OUT This happens more often to women than to men. The concern is about losing more than 50 to 100 individual hairs a day (depending on person). If in the first 40 days of fasting hair falls out more the \"normally\", there is no need to worry unless the body is emaciated. Even if a lot of hair falls out, later you may notice that they have grown back stronger and maybe even thicker. If body is thin and hair starts to fall out after 6th week of fasting, it can very well mean t hat the body is in the process of emaciation. If a gaunt person is fasting and notices losing a lot of hair, it may be a clear indication that the fast does not well benefit the person. For an obese body there is no danger of emaciation until the perfect b ody weight is restored. During this time losing a lot of hair is a temporary phenomenon. Later new hair will grow in place of the lost one. SWELLING JOINTS This occurs during the first or second month of fasting. Joints are swelling up but there is no pai n. This mainly happens to the knees and tarsal joints. You can also feel pain if the joint was ill before, because now it is being cleaned and repaired as much as the body can do it. Swelling of joints may also be caused by drinking water containing salt or even by drinking too much water during fasting. When joints are swelling even though the person drinks very little or is dry fasting, it means that the body is cleansing the joints from accumulated salt deposits. So there is nothing that needs to be done, just wait, because the swelling will dissipate after a few to over a dozen days. To take in chemicals (called medicines) against swelling in such a situation most often is a mistake. HIGH PULSE AND HEART RATE If you experience this symptom, there is nothing to worry about. Your heart is perfectly well. During the cleansing process the body will never damage the main life sustaining systems, like heart or brain. This symptom appears due to excessive amount of toxins in your intestine that go directly into the blood flow. Usually this symptom may come along with weakness or headache, but not necessarily (with each person it may be different). Trying t o get rid of toxins faster the heart and blood system starts work ing faster too. The second possible explanation: not receiving food from digestive system, the body starts consuming more oxygen and it is resulted in a higher heart rate. This symptom should tell you that you would better wash your intestine. After a good intestine wash , the symptom will disappear or will become weaker . OTHER Every person goes through fasting in different ways. There are many possible symptoms in the spheres of psyche and body which may manifest during fasting. It is more important and beneficial for the fasting person to keep in mind a favorable picture, in which perfect well -being and health dominates (right visualization). Concentrating thoughts on a symptom may exaggerate it in the mind, that is, create visualization damaging the person. "},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 89 In case of most symptoms you may just wait until they pass, because they are caused by the self -cleansing of the body. The body needs time to eliminate the toxic material that had been retained in it. But all the time you should “keep your eyes open\", act with reason and do not allow any fear to prevail. WHAT TO PAY MOST ATTENTION TO SECLUSION Seclusion (being away from people) proves to be very advisable, in case of many people even necessary, during f irst few months of non- eating or fasting. Seclusion concerns not only people but also things and daily activities (e.g. work, contact with mass media, household). It is better to find a place which is not connected to home. It is good to go into the open n ature, to a place far from towns, roads, people, and not contact family or friends (except in emergency situations). If you decide to stay in partial seclusion, that is close to or in another part of the house (so that you are there to act “in case”), you will probably want to make a break every day in order to meet a person who can advice you if needed. This person can be your link to the “external” world if you are in need of something (a book, cloths), that is, be there to take care of you. If you both decide to do this, first establish the rules about the details of the contacts and help etc. It is more advantageous if this person has experience in the area of non- eating and fasting, so that he/she can advice you when you feel such a need, because different situations, doubts, questions, needs may arise. Many people decide to stay in complete seclusion, without meeting anybody and not receiving any help. From safety perspective this is less advantageous. Seek advice and consider it carefully before you decide to do so. If you are thinking of what to do, feel the answer from within you. If you still have doubts, first got for the adviser option. Why seclusion is important? It is mainly about silencing yourself and turning the attention of the intellect to your inner part, to the spiritual side of life. Apart from being in silence, the person in seclusion, far from unnecessarily absorbing occupations (mass media, noise of the street, chatter etc.), has more chances and time to concentrate on processes occurring in his/her psyche. During the seclusion performing exercises beneficial for humans, like contemplation, meditation, visualization and also energizing exercises, becomes easier. It is worth to use this time to do the exercises because of all the benefits they provide. WITHOUT FORCING It is better not to fight against the body because it is “the temple of the spirit” (in fact, the body is inside the spirit). The body is an integral part of the being called a human. Fighting causes wounds, psychical harms and even casualties. If you fight against your body, who will be harmed? How does develop the body of a person who often forces it to do something, fights against it and harms it? Alternatively, how develops the body of a person who surrounds it wi th Love? "},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 90 The body is administered by the instinct, which needs educating in the same way in which a wise loving parent educates his/her child. The body informs you about its needs if you are tuned to feeling it. To be tuned to feeling what is best for t he body is more important than just thinking about this. Each body is different and best communicates with its owner though the feeling. So when people stop fighting against the body and deal with it as would a wise loving parent, the body responds proper ly. Advices concerning nourishing, proceeding principles, methods of adaption, and so on are less important than the needs that you feel come from your body. When you perceive them well and allow the body to feel your love, it develops in the best way poss ible. Using discipline with the body you make sure that it will give you most of what it can do. What is discipline? It is systematic activity full of reason and love, with the aim of achieving something. The discipline does not know forcing because it onl y has good in mind. Thanks to discipline one can adapt the body to many things which are considered impossible. It is an important skill to be able to distinguish between discipline and forcing, because the line between them is not clear. When you rely on feeling the body and you have the right knowledge, you know what still is an act of the discipline and what already is forcing. This skill is very useful when you are keeping the body in discipline, especially when you are eliminating addictions (eating to o much is one of them). LIMITED BELIEF IN INFORMATION In a subject area that you have not explored enough and where information is not readily available, misunderstandings can arise. This is also true for fast ing s. For your own security, if information is unproven by you, it is worth to consider whether and how you will use it? In this case a good solution is to be in touch with a person having enough knowledge about the matter. Also it pays to remember what I have emphasized before, that any information has one of the attributes, it is partially or wholly true or false. What is written in books (even those considered great or holy) and what other persons say (even those considered authoritative or holy) still has one of these attributes. This is why, when you do not have proven information, you better rely more on your feeling of the intuition rather than on things said or written by others. Even if something is true for a one person, it does not have to be so for other people. In other words, what is t rue in the world of one person, does not have to work in the same way in the world of another person. Every person is different, the world of every person is different, thus same data may have different attributes. Something can be true and false at the same time. ALONE OR NOT Consider, whether during the time of long fasting (if you are plann ing to do this) you will be in touch with a protector (caregiver). A protector is a person that you trust, who has a big experience, who can visit and advice you eve n when you are in a seclusion. If you do not meet the protector, you can speak with him/her on the phone. "},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 91 Such meetings with the protector are done in order to check if everything (with you) is right or if you need something (help, advice, object, pass a message). If you feel the need to be in a full seclusion, at least tell your relatives and intimates where you will stay, for how long and what you will be doing. Even if you have decided to be completely alone, make sure that, just in case, you will be able to contact an experienced person, because you may suddenly feel that somehow you need this. BODY TEMPERATURE Living in a not tropical climate, while intensively adapting the body for living without food, it is worth to pay more attention to a common s ymptom — feeling cold. Most often the hands and feet are cold, almost icy, even when the air temperature is comparatively high, say 77 Fahrenheit . At this or higher temperature the person feels cold. If feeling cold bothers you too much, better turn your attention to the body temperature, because it is one of indicators of person's life energy. When the body temperature falls below 95 Fahrenheit , it is sufficient reason for taking an action, because forcing the body to work at too low body temperature is dangerous. If you feel cold and you do not want to start eating, wear warmer cloths and perform frequently energizing exercising. Also add proper visualization in which, for example, you see and feel yourself as a source of warmth, the body is emanating warmth as a fire does. If too much cold is felt for too long (comparing to other fasting people) it is worth to check the liver and spleen, because there is a high chance that they do not work efficiently enough. If the extremities remain too cold and blue, you can warm them somehow. It is worth to make the extremities warm during the sleep even if it means to put thick gloves and socks on when going to bed. However, wearing thicker cloths and warming the extremities are not the proper solutions for a longer time, because such actions do not stimulate a human to free sufficient amount of life energy for the body. The most proper solution is the one which causes enough energy to be released from self. The most important thing is, when talking about feeling cold, to know what is the cause — insufficient amount or inefficient circulation of life energy in the person. Until the person gave up eating, he/she had been releasing the energy under the effect of the eaten food. Now, when the person does not eat any m ore, his/her task consists in teaching the instinct to release the energy in sufficient amount also without receiving any food. DRINKING WHEN NOT EATING A mistake often done by fasting persons is that they force themselves to drink too much or too littl e water. Drink water or other liquids in quantity which is demanded by your body. If you drink more or less than your body really needs, you are harming it. When you drink too much, you force the digestive system, especially the kidneys, to deal with the overload. "},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 92 The excess of water in body may cause leg or face swelling. It also may cause excessive mucus which the body removes through a rash, catarrh or cough. Water is the best solvent and energy source but in excess it increases body energy requirement. People who drink a lot during fasting think that by doing this they can better flush out toxins from the body. The body is not a toilet so one cannot clean it by flushing it with more water; on the contrary, it may result in less toxins being removed. The best solution is to drink the amount of water that the body demands for. Drink when you are thirsty, not when hungry. Drink slowly, sipping and mixing with the saliva before swallowing it. WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT VITAMINS FROM DRUGSTORES? Vitami ns from the drugstores are not alive because they are not in “activated” state and can not be digested by our body . There are many scientific works proving that synthetically manufactured vitamins do not participate in metabolic process within our body, they are useless, and moreover, they are harmful for our body. Saying “harmful” I do not mean that they are poisonous, I mean that the body will have to spend its own resources and energy to eliminate this waste from the organism . All you need to remember about vitamins is the word “ V ITA”, meaning LIFE. Life is found only in living things . But the results of these researches are concealed from people because they are not beneficial for the owners of pharmaceutical corporations. There are 10 main pharmaceuti cal corporations in the world. Their net income per year is 5 trillion US dollars! Bill Gates is a little dwarf if we compare him to these monsters. Each year they benefit tens of billion dollars from selling synthetic vitamins just in the USA alone. It is a huge industry . Do you still believe that our health and our well being is their primary objective? They have enough money to reconcile any legal actions and to lobby any legislations in their favor. One more fact to think about : In 1980, according to the International classification of diseases there were 10 000 diseases. Now we have 25 000 diseases . Each year we acquire a thousand of new incurable diseases. This is just an example to demonstrate how successful our advanced medicine is. Can the indust ry acknowledge that synthetic vitamins are useless? It would be the same as to acknowledge their own defeat (and lose tremendous profits). Can you imagine a situation when an American doctor who takes $1000 for a visit would prescribe his patient"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 93 a lemon? But it looks totally different when he writes something mysterious on a Latin language. And the patient thinks : “ Oh , doctor writes a prescription in Latin” – it is a reverence for the mystery and for the priest of medicine! That is when he is ready to pay his $ 1000 for nothing. If he would spend this $1000 for fresh fruits and vegetables if would be more beneficial foe him and his family . It would really help him and his family to improve their health and prevent development of diseases. Medical industry is a huge deception. Well, it can be helpful in very rare cases , but in most cases it is just a huge deception that serves the interests of corporations. Only in the USA this medical deception costs us 2 trillion dollars a year! It is half of this county’s budget! What does this number mean? It means that all the people in the United Stated work half a year only to pay their medical bills !!! OK. You know that #1 and #2 killers in the world are cardio -vascular diseases and cancer . And I ’ve promised to tell you about the third main cause of deaths. Do you want to know what cause takes the third place ? According to the statistics, deaths caused by iatrogenic occasions take the third place among main killers. I will explain: a veiled word “ iatrogenic ” means “deaths caused by the doctors’ actions, medications and medicine”. 10% of all deaths are caused by so called iatrogenic occasions. The medicine itself is THE THIRD CAUSE of all deaths. Can you imagine anything that could be more absurd ??? Here is the official report : “225 thousand deaths per year in the USA are caused by iatrogenic occasions, which makes the public health service the third leading cause of all deaths after cardio- vascular diseases and cancer”. Have you ever seen a better oxymoron? «Public healt h is the third main cause of all deaths in the USA !» What is more , it is a very expensive cause of death, very expensive! Do not be caught in the web of medicine! And remember: i t’s never too late to become healthy ! And now you know how. Eat fresh, natur al, organic , raw ripe fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, berries, herbs and be healthy!  "},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 94 SUMMARY If you want to eliminate the cause of any disease you should fast for not less than 21 days, but I would even recommend you to fast even longer than 28 days. You should keep in mind that the first stage of fasting when you do not eat is not the main phase, it is just a preparatory period for mobilization of toxins. THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF FASTING is the consequent process of eliminati on of the toxins during the second phase – when one drinks fresh fruit juices ! N.B. I recommend this kind of long fastings only for those people who are younger than 45- 50 years old and have relatively stable health condition. In all the rest cases I would consider 7- 10- days fastings to be more optimal: one week of water fasting  an enema  one week of drinking fresh fruit juices (starches)  one week of drinking of all kinds of juices + eating raw fresh fruits and vegetables + sauna  transition t o natural raw food lifestyle. I call it a “lifestyle” and not a “diet ”, because raw food is not a diet but the best fuel for our body and mind. Our bodies were designed to work properly if we keep eating raw natural food. That is why raw food is not a di et, but a lifestyle. Paul Bragg also thought that it is good to fast 3- 4 times a year and he came up with this formula intuitively, by experience. But Arnold Ehret made the same conclusion even earlier, in the beginning of the 20 th century. Fasting cur e is not easy, as it is not easy for a woman to give birth to a child. Yet it is possible. You will feel a great relief right after the first sip of a fresh fruit juice diluted with pure water. In speleology (it is when people explore caverns) there is a s pecial word “flayers” – it is a place where a person has to squeeze himself through a very narrow passage, flaying his skin to survive. All the information written here is for those of you who choose to survive. "},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 95 4 OUR MIND No healing is possible without help of our mind. And in fact, your mind, your intentions and your attitude play the major role in the process of healing. Our body and mind are interdependent and interconnected. It’s your mind that controls any movement you make. Even now, when you are reading this line your eyes are moving. Your thoughts or, it’s better to say, your intention makes your eyes move. And it happens in an instant. Your thoughts control your body, your life and your health including. THE POWER OF PRAYER... SOMETHING TO TH INK ABOUT A botanist by the name of Dr Robert Jerome, at the University of Mexico, found that by intentionally sending out loving thoughts to his plants, he was able to make them grow much faster. He also discovered that by sending out hateful thoughts, he was able to cause plants to wither and die in five weeks (even when receiving proper care of soil, water and sunlight). It makes you wonder doesn't it? Prayed over seeds grow faster than ones that are left to their own devices. Minister Franklin Loehr and his researchers have performed experiments with 20,000 seeds and have satisfactorily demonstrated that prayer affects germination and growth if it is done repeatedly. When you send out loving thoughts to help them grow and ingest them, you are eating 'l ove consciousness'. Sounds very airy -fairy - but every living thing has a consciousness. I suggest you develop a relationship with your sprouts because they are going give you more than you could ever wish for. Eliminate bad, destructive, inappropriate, r epeating depressive thoughts from your mind. Replace them with positive, constructive, creative thoughts and you will change everything. Feed your mind with appropriate food too. It’s food is inspiration! Find it! Start dreaming about somethi ng! Something that can bring true joy and happiness into your life. Maybe you’ve always dream t about tak ing a bi cycle and going around the world to see it with our own eyes? It is possible! Lots of people travel this way. Take some time to heal your body and just do it! Why not! : -) Take a piece of paper, start making plans, write them down, put the exact dates when you plan to fulfill them ! I’m not go ing to write much here. There are a lot of inspirational books and film s that you can find yourself. I will give you jus t a few ideas . Here are the links to the best books tha t can change your life forever!"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 96 First of all , I insist that you buy and read all three parts of “Reality Transurfing” books by Vadim Zeland.

Just the fact of reading them can change your life! http://www.amazon. com/Vadim- Zeland/e/B0034NNQ1K/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_1 Secondly , there is a good book called “ When Everything Changes, Change Everything ” by Neale Donald Walsch.

They are awesome! Thirdly, find and read “The Power of Now” by Eckhart Tolle Sinc e childhood we learn how to use our hands (to eat, to hold, to play a guitar..). We learn how to use our voice, our muscles , we learn to memorize , to behave. But we are never taught to use the most important tool that directly creates all our life – our mi nd!

Many people who learn about the most natural way of eating (raw mono eating) that allows to get rid of most of the diseases and optimize their health, body appearance and mental condition are exited and try to switch to the lifestyle of a raw mono vegan . But unfortunately , many of their attempts fail. There are two types of failure s: 1) the person returns back to tradition al poisonous food because she /he can not resist the temptations of our civilization or the pressure of the society; or 2) Suddenly she/he faces some physical or mental disorders, that is, the effect that has been expected turns out to be absolutely oppos ite. Maybe there is something wrong with our theory and it is better for people to eat cooked food? Each of us should find the answer to this question herself/himself. I just want to present you both points of view regarding this question. Let’s imagine a dialogue between a raw vegan and a follower of traditional eating: Traditionalist (T): - Why to limit yourself? Raw Mono Vegan (V): - It helps to be healthy and live a long life. T: - But I read that vegans get ill too. V: - Our health depends on many factors, food is only one of them, that is why it is not a surprise. But you should also know there is a huge number of testimonials about people who changed their diet to raw mono eating and were “miraculously” healed from so called incurable diseases. T: - How can it be explained? V: - You see , nature designed our bodies in a certain way and they work properly only when we fuel them with appropriate food, destined exactly for us. This appropriate fuel is able to maintain the body in an optimal conditi on. The food that is not natural and is not appropriate poisons our organism and provokes many diseases. T: - Why do you think that cooked food is not natural? V: - Because it cannot be found in nature. Т : - But humans have been cooking food for centur ies already! V: - And can we assert that after all those centuries humanity were becoming healthier and happier? T: - Yes! My favorite food brings me lots of pleasures! And I’m ready to get ill from time to time and even die for it, as most of us do, in my 60 -70 years old!"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 98 V: - Well , my favorite food also brings me lots of pleasures , but I do not have to sacrifice my health and life for it. Like you , I also liked cooked and unnatural food . But we can always change our habits . T: - What about pesticides and chemicals in fruits and vegetables? V: - I know it is a problem now. But do you know that animal products have 8- 10 more pesticides that fruits and vegetables? Besides that have antibiotics and hormones. If you are so concerned about pesticides and che micals, it is more beneficial to eat fruits, nuts, berries, vegetables – they have less pesticides and also, you can always find organic plant foods, or even grow some yourself! T: - And what about the scientists and their opinion? You know, in every box or package I buy it is written: “Cook it for this or that long” ! V: - The scientists and the doctors are ordinary people they get ill too and live not longer than the rest of humans. That is why those who want to be healthy should take responsibility for their health themselves. There are two ways to change you r diet : gradual (when you gradually increase the amount of raw food , removing cooked food from your diet) and instant (when you instantly start eating only raw food and deny any cooked food. You make a firm decision to start a new life with your raw vegan lifestyle). Both of them can be effective . But I would rather prefer the second method. But my opinion is just my opinion, investigate for yourself this subject , think and make your own decision . Hav en’t we already discussed that you need to take responsibility for your life and your health into your own hands? And it’s the most important decision for those who are willing to be healthy. I would like to mark out two main difficulties that faces the person who wants to become a raw vegan: Psychological – old habits , relationships with people, vague goals and absence of well - defined plans to fulfill them ; And the second difficulty is lack of own experience – when you do not have enough experience you just do not know what is appropriate to eat , what is not . That is why , sometimes , due to the lack of knowledge people might buy fried nuts (thinking that they are raw ), or dried fruits (most of dried fruits we find in the stores and markets were exposed t o heat treatment or even chemical treatment, you should be aware of it!). Moreover , due to the lack of knowledge these people add salt to their food, start mixing different kinds of food with each other. All this slows down the transition process and very often leads to uncheerful results mentioned above. Let’s start with the main thing, psychological part , that is. There is one thing I want you to understand: food cult is the BIGGEST cult of our society. It is even more powerful than all the religions, se cts, political parties combined together. It ’s in people’ s nature to receive pleasure from everything associated with food: from a wide variety of tastes , from a sense of satiety, from all these meal ceremonies, from communications with friends while shari ng a meal, from all these talks about food, from a process of cooking , from reading about someone’s meal in a book, from culinary scenes on TV, from visiting a café or a restaurant, and so on and so on and so on... During your transition period most of the se little sweet killing pleasures will be only in your reminiscences. It is similar to the state of an ex -smoker, or a ex -alcoholic, who have only reminiscence s of those times and “pleasures” when they were poisoning their bodies. "},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 99 It is hard to eliminate these “pleasures” from one’s life when they are so common. And you know, most of people are ready to die for them ... But , I hope it is not about you, moreover, I have promised to give some advices so that your transition period would pass smoothly. Her e is the set of my advices for the beginners: 1. Estimate your emotional strength. How hard is it for you to refuse your habits? Do you have an experience to cope with them? Maybe you would like to start with something smaller? To give up smoking or give up drinking popular drinks (besides alcohol drinks there are many other poisonous drinks, like cola, for example) , to give up eating meat, to stop consuming junk food and fried food - just a few ideas to think. Ask yourself : what can you sacrifice for your ow n good health and clear mind ? 2. Make a firm decision. Many people try to change their diet without any firm decision. This leaves them more room for doubts, they suffer each time when they start thinking about their favorite poisons that are so habitual. T o make a firm decision means to leave your doubts behind the door and accept the thought that you refuse to consume all your lovely poisons. 3. And remember – all sufferings come from your own thoughts. As soon as you notice a thought about your usual destr uctive foods, kick it out! When you kick it out a hundred of times , it will forget the road leading to your mind. But most of the beginners do the opposite – they relish all these tiny sweet y thoughts about their lovely poisons: they imagine their tastes, all the smells... I tell you, this is the straight road to schizophrenia and other not very pleasant diseases. TAKE A FULL CONTROL OVER YOUR THOUGHTS! 4. As a variant , you may substitute one kind of thoughts to other . As soon as you notice a treacherous though t about your lovely meal, replace it with a thought about your health for which you have started all this transition to raw eating. I would recommend you to write down all your goals on a piece of paper. It is very important to know and remember why and wh at for you do all this. 5. Keep away from traditional meals as far as you can! Avoid restaurants, birthday parties and other celebrations in companies. Of course I’m talking about those meetings that are not so vitally important to you. A good question to re member : “does this meeting lead me closer to my goals?” If you decide that you should go to that meeting (party, celebration, whatever) think of what you are going to eat there and take with you something that you will be able to eat there. 6. Be sure you have enough different kinds of raw food in your home. Buy the food that can be kept for pretty long time (the list of the food will be presented below). 7. Avoid a large diversity of food. Choose 3-5 kinds of fruits you can eat with great pleasure . And eat only them for some time . After a couple of days (or as soon as you feel you want something different and cannot eat these 2- 5 kinds of fruits anymore) change some of them to some other fruits or vegetables that seems more pleasant. This will help you to avo id voracious appetite which is common for the beginners. The body that got used to consuming poisons that are contained in cooked food demands to give it another dose – that is the main reason for voracious appetite. Give it healthy raw vegan food instead – there is a wide variety"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 100 of delicious fruits, vegetables and nuts. Do not expect to achieve the results very fast . The body needs time to restore its functions . Each case is individual - sometimes it takes months , sometimes it can take a year or more (to detox and restore your health back to normal). 8. Take it as the main rule: eat only one kind of food during one meal. The quantity of this food does not matter, eat as much as you want (with reasonable limits, of course) - for the initial stage it is ok. Try not to hurry , eat slowly , feel the taste deeply, enjoy the process. Make a pause between the meals. At least 30 minutes ! This period depends on the kind of food you eat . For fruits it can be 30 minutes (they are digested best of all). If you eat legume s or nuts then the pause you make should not be less than 1-2 hours (it’s the time your body needs to digest them) . If you break this rule , watch carefully your body reactions and what you feel. Very soon you’ll be able to regulate the order of the food you eat, just be attentive, listen to your body, and you will learn. Usually, those who decide to change their diet to raw veganism become obsessed with food for some time : -) But after some time (after a few months probably), your life will return back to n ormal – you’ll have new habits and food preferences. 9. Do not let yourself make any salads or other \"raw vegan dishes” – it is just an attempt to compensate the lack of usual cooked food. Yes, when you mix different kids of food you can get new tastes, but will it help your body to digest this \"mishmash \" properly and effectively ? 10. Do not forget that the main idea of raw veganism is to receive the most natural nourishment in its natural form. What for do we need a tongue and a sense of taste? Firstly, they help us to distinguish between a good fruit and a bad one. If you taste a tomato that begins to rot , you will spit it out . But if you take the same tomato, cut it, add it to other tomatoes in a plate, you’ll hardly notice the spoiled one. And if you add t here some cucumbers, add salt and oil... You see ? That ’s where it starts all over again! I do not recommend you to follow this path. You risk to finish you journey at the same point where you’ve started. The second function of our sense of taste is to prepar e your digestive system for effective digestion of the food you eat, that is, to digest a certain kind of food, already known to our body. If we will keep changing one kind of food to another constantly , our body will never have a chance to become aquatint ed with the food we eat, in this case we just use our sense of taste only for our own satisfaction. And we all know it is not always a good thing to do. 11. The tongue tells us that such products as onion, garlic , pepper are not the best choice of food for us . At least they can be used as medicine. And if you a raw vegan, you won’t need them very often ; -) 12. Forget about calories, vitamins and microelements. Trust your body and the food designed especially for it by our wise N ature. Do not consume salt, there i s enough salt in raw vegan food. If you have choice, prefer rain water or snow water. This water (if not polluted) is better than water from springs. Very often springs’ waters contain different minerals and salts that will accumulate in your body, leading to vascular diseases, stones e.t.c.. But of course you can drink spring water, it is much better than ordinary tap water or water you buy in supermarkets. But usually raw vegans do not h ave a need to drink much water (there is enough of pure structured water in all the living fruits). More information about water you can find in"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 101 the book “Water, The Shocking Truth” written by Paul Bragg. It is very hard to find water of a good quality in the cities, buy a good filter and start thinking about a place where you’d prefer to live in the future : -) 13. Start exercising , take cold showers or baths. Your active way of live and hardening of your organism are of the same importance to your health as your food. Do you remember the initial thought why you decide to ch ange your diet? It ’s your desire to become healthier by means of changing your diet to more natural. Now, answer the following questions: - what is more natural for your body: to move or to sit in front of a computer screen? What temperature extremes it can endure? Maybe it’s time to give your body a chance to show its talents? My own experience and experience of many other people prove that bathing in cold water are very beneficial for our physical and mental health. Cold water is a blessing ! Moreover , hardening accelerates the metabolic process in your body which is a positive factor that helps you during the transition period. 14. Exclude honey from your diet. Honey is food for bees and not for humans. It can destroy your teeth very fast . You can find lot s of literature about valuable features of honey , but you should remember that bee- farming is another part of a huge food industry. I bet, with the same success you will find books about valuable features of bars of chocolate. But of course, in some rare c ases honey can be used as medicine, the same as onion or garlic. 15. Dairy products may lead to diseases , including very serious ones , like diabetes . Animal milk is destined for feeding their small babies. There are no mature animals in wild nature that drink milk. Well, it’s up to you . But since you ’ve made a decision to follow this path, it will be a very strange decision to consume dairy products just because you want them so badly. :) 16. I need to say a few words about mushrooms. There are all kinds of mushrooms and raw vegans also eat them. But I would not recommend you to eat them. You never know , sometimes even among good mushrooms there can be found poisonous ones . Probably , after eating such a mushroom you ’ll get a stomach upset , I doubt that you will enjoy it. But again, it’s up to you. And I have warned you :-) 17. Be sure to wash your mouth after each meal with pure water. If you don’ t do it, you risk getting dental calculus which destroys enamel . And I’m more than sure, that’s not in your best int erests. Now I’ll try to describe what a raw vegan diet should look like. This will help you to go through the transition period smoothly. "},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 102 First of all I’ll divide our menu according to 3 major periods: winter, spring and the first part of summer, the sec ond part of summer and autumn (it is actual for all the people living beyond the tropical or subtropical zones) . There is a plenty of food for a raw vegan during these seasons. Many problems of the beginners (psychological, physiological) arise due to the lack of knowledge – people just do not know what they can eat and what else can be included in their diet. Any season will do to start changing your diet from traditional to a raw food diet. And of course, psychologically, it is easier to do in the per iod of abundance of ripe fruits. But do not forget that your transition period may take you a year, so it does not actually matter. You have advices described here, so in any season you’ll able to find enough food. I’m not going to describe what to eat in the season of abundance (summer -autumn), but rather tell you about two other seasons: So, there is snow outside and our fruits become expensive. Well it is high time to make supplies . Or we ’ll have to accept the fact that we’ll have to buy expensive food from those who have made the supplies. But in this case we risk to buy chemically treated and temperature treated food. We need to learn how to use our sense of smell to detect them. So, what does a raw mono vegan eat in winter ? 1. Fruits : a. Apples (some kinds of apples can be stored in cool places up till May) b. Pears (some kinds of pears can be stored till the end of winter ) c. Grapes (some kind of them can be stored for a few months ) d. Other fruits like oranges, tangerines, pomelo, bananas, kiwi, pineapples, tomatoes e.t.c.... ( avocado... is it a fruit or a vegetable? : -) e. Dried fruits can be good too if you make them yourself . Don’t buy those from the stores and markets – most of them were treated chemically or thermally. 2. Vegetables : a. Potatoes (try unusual raw foods at least once a month – your habits and your taste change fast and the body will tell you whether this food is good for you or not. Some people actually like to eat raw potatoes from time to time, who knows ) b. Pumpkin – there are different kinds of it w ith different tastes. They are easy to grow and easy to store. c. Carrots . d. Cabbage – try different kinds , I’m sure some of them you will like more than the others . e. Cucumbers . In winter they grow in greenhouses. Try to find organic . 3. Legumes. This food is very saturating. But you need to soak it into the water for 3- 12 hours before you eat it. It is: a. Peas . b. Lentils c. Mung beans d. Chick -pea"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 103 e. Peanuts – this one you can eat even without soaking it into the water . Very often the peanuts they sell are roasted . One general rule – buy only that food about which you don’t have any doubts. The best way to figure out if the legumes are raw and living: soak them into the water, give them enough time to sprout, if they do, you will know for sure that they are living food. I f not, throw this dead food away. This principle is also applicable to all seeds, cereals, nuts. Be inquisitive , try to figure out what you eat, it’s fun! We are what we eat. 4. Cereals. If there is nothing to eat, it’s not a very bad food too (if you do not have fresh tasty fruits). Most of the cereals should be soaked into the water and sprouted before eating. Sprouts have 3-5 times more nutrients than dry grains, when a seed sprouts, it wakes up and synthesizes all the building materials for its growth. When it becomes alive, its taste and energy are different. a. Wheat b. Rye c. Buckwheat d. Corn e. Oats f. Sunflower seeds g. Pumpkin seeds h. Nuts . Buy only the nuts in shell . They should not be cracked. Very often the manufactures dry the nuts in ovens, though these nuts don’t not look like roasted, they are dead. Remember , everything heated above 42C (107.6 Fahrenheit) is dead (enzymes, amino acids and DNA are destroyed at the temperature above 107.6 Fahrenheit). And again , the rule is simple : do not buy it if you are not sure! :- ) i. Walnut j. Cedar nut k. Hazelnut l. Almond m. Apricot cores n. Do not buy cashew nuts! All of them are roasted right after picking with no exclusions. I’ve enumerated just the main kinds of food. You can always find more information at raw vegan sites and forums or through google search . One of the best sites for raw mono eating is www.fruitarians.net Now a few words about “cooking ” :-). I mean I’m going to explain how to soak the grains, seeds and nuts for sprouting. Any seeds (including nuts) are ready to eat in a dry form. But it will be much better if you sprout them (or at least soften them with water). After soaking them in water they change their taste and other properties. Thus you can achieve even larger spectrum of tastes. To sprout seeds/ grains is very simple. You need to soak them in pure water and pour it out after 6 -12 hours. Thus, the seeds will have access to air and will be able to breathe. Leave your plate (or a container) with seeds in a warm place and within a couple of days"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"anti -cancer.weebly.com 104 (in most cases, because some seeds need less time, some other seeds more) you will see small sprouts. And of course you ’ll have a desire to plant them :-) Some seeds require more special conditions, like keeping them wet w ith free access to air at the same time. In this case you can sprout them using a wet cheesecloth or a piece of thin fabric, folded several times. What does a raw mono vegan eat in spring -summer period ? In spring there are lots of fresh herbs, you can al so add them to your diet. Some of them : lettuce, celery , parsley , dill, radish , sorrel and others (in fact, you can make your own garden at home on your windowsill). In the beginning of summer the berries show up (wild strawberries, cherry e.t.c.) . As you can see, your menu can be pretty broad. So, get rid of your fears ! Make your firm decision , buy your favorite raw fruits, write an explanatory note to your relatives :-) and start improving your health! Be ready to lose some weight, don’t panic, the weight will be stabilized and will become normal within a year. Do not forget that such a change in your lifestyle is a serious challenge for your mind. That is why start exploring your own soul – you should keep it in harmony to be strong. And there is no dou bt the body and your soul will adjust to the changes.
