This is not a medical document and is only presented in this form for ease ofunderstanding the material. The author is merely sharing non-professionalexperience in self treating an uncommon condition in the interest of making theinsights available to interested parties. ___________________________________________________________AbstractThe purpose of this paper is to share my own successful experiences inself-treating the condition that has come to be known as “Morgellons,” utilizingSSKI (saturated solution of potassium iodide) . While describing my ownobservations of the condition as it presented in myself. I will discuss thediscrepancies in the concentration of KI as described in the known medicalprotocol for using SSKI in treating sporotrichosis. In comparison to my ownexperiences in attempting to follow that protocol . I will suggest that thecondition is an as-yet unidentified human pathogen in the dimorphic fungusfamily.This document should not be confused with, or as being, any sort of medicaldocumentation, as it is written well outside of any professional circles and ismerely the observations of a layman in the process of self-treatment afterfinding professional medical help unavailable. ___________________________________________________________IntroductionThe following is based in my own experience and observations in examining andself-treating the condition referred to as “Morgellons” between the years 2000to 2017. During the time of this illness, the condition had reached chroniclevels before I realized the parallels of the symptoms I was experiencing to thecondition(s) known as sporotrichosis. I then successfully followed the protocolfor using SSKI in treating sporotrichosis commonly found in medical literature.___________________________________________________________Case Report / Patient history Caucasian male, born in 1963, raised in western Washington State, in a woodedenvironment until teen years. Relocated to central Oklahoma at age 16. Thecondition initially presented during a trip to western Washington at age 39.This subject has resided in central Oklahoma since that time and during thecourse of the illness and treatment.My condition became noticeable around the year 2000 when pimple-like soresbecame present in the skin of my torso . I found no relief from treating withcalamine lotion or other common home remedies. In the following few years, thecondition had become primarily present on my ankles, shins, hands, and forearms. After first appearing as the small pimple-type sores , they became larg eround lesions with a raised edges that would eventually create a “faux healing”by covering with what appeared to be a callous. Excessive scratching of newlyaffected areas could cause large patches of epidermis to break free from thedermis and peel away, revealing what appeared to be white fungal growths in thepores of the dermis. I treated topically with an antifungal cream withnoticeable improvement, but limited success. I visited a General Practitioner,and later , a Dermatologist who only performed cursory examinations of mysymptoms, and then, only prescribed psychiatric drugs, which were of no use inaddressing the condition. In 2006, I turned to the internet to search for fungalconditions that paralleled my symptoms and immediately became distracted fromthat area of study by the “Morgellons” phenomenon that was blossoming online.Finding parallels in symptoms and similar unhe lpful experience with doctors inthat online community of sufferers, I joined them in hoping for answers from theCDC or the medical community. I broke contact with those communities in 2008after the study performed by Kaiser Permanente produced no helpful results.In the years leading up to 2015 , my health was greatly deteriorating as Iexperimented on myself in a race to find answers before potentially losing thefight to the ailment. I had tried every topical treatment conceivable, tolimited affect. Eventually, I made the drastic decision to use a wart removalproduct to freeze every affected location in order to determine whether thecondition was topical or systemic. The condition did not , and apparently couldnot , return to areas of skin that had been frozen, but did return in otherareas. I took this as evidence of a systemic condition and proceeded tocarefully experiment with various internal treatments, including a trip toMexico for a full run of powerful , injectable antibiotics , ultimately to noavail. By Fall of 2015, I had resigned to succumbing to the condition and waspreparing to lie down , to finish being consumed by it, in full knowledge thatit was an unknown systemic condition. During these years , I had been writing onmy private FaceBook page o f my illness and experiences and an adult-age niececontacted me. She had been reading th e information I was posting and, afterresearch, found parallels in what I was describing and a fungal infection knownas sporotrichosis. I leapt at the opportunity for hope and dug in quickly tostudy the information available online. I saw enough parallels in the symptomsto believe in a possible connection . Si nce a medically recognized treatmentoption was within my grasp in following the protocol for using a saturatedsolution of potassium iodide, (SSKI), I had nothing to lose in trying it, andsourced the materials immediately. Important to note at this time : During the treatment, I learned that there isdiscrepancy in the SSKI protocol described in medical literature and in reality.(1) Medical literature apparently assumes a .50ml drop of SSKI contains .50mg ofpotassium iodide, (KI,) while the reality is that a .50ml drop of SSKI contains.70mg of KI. This discrepancy makes the higher dosage amounts described inmedical literature of as much as 50 to 55 drops, three times per day, inaccurateand entirely too much. I was not aware of this at the time, but was determinedto follow the protocol . F or as many as 10 weeks, I did use 50 drops, threetimes per day, to a very miserable effect as to how I felt, but that onlyculminated in the medical result of an increased heart rate during that use anda possible sensitivity to potassium iodide that faded over a few weeks. Iremained dedicated to the protocol because the positive effects on my well beingwere almost immediate and in time, I learned of the discrepancy regarding theprotocol. After 15 years of an untreated systemic fungal infection, my entirebody was involved and even normal movement was restricted and painful. Thefatigue was intense, and I had the feeling of a weight around my neck thatforced me to hunch forward. While the effects of the SSKI were quickly noticedin the reduced activity/fungal growth of the lesions, the positive effect on thefatigue and related aching symptoms was nearly immediate. With these effectscombined, I was convinced that I had stumbled onto the answer which drove meforward in consuming the massive amounts of KI described in the medicalliterature, despite the discomfort of doing so. I would later learn that thereare described amounts of KI used for these purposes measured in grams. It is asimple matter of basic math to figure the number of .07g drops appropriate fortreatment to achieve 2g to 3g per day, dependent on the patient’s tolerance, asis the recognized range for effective treatment. (2)According to my own condition, and from discussions with other sufferers, theMorgellons condition initially presents as a variety of unusual complaints.These complaints range from numerous black specks emerging from the skin, totiny white fibers that resemble cotton strands emerging from the skin,(sometimes with noticeable movement of the white fibers). In later stages,complaints include weeping lesions that contain unidentified “yeast-like”growths that are usually described as resembling worms or nematodes whenforcibly removed from the lesion. Internal complaints include fatigue, jointpain, and gastric pain and discomfort. Diarrhea or constipation is common. Also present in my own lesions were a variety of fiber types which ranged fromthe fine white “cotton strands” that could be present in singular form or assnarled masses, to coarse off-white fibers. Black fibers that resembled insectlegs were common, as were coarse black fibers that some morgellons sufferershave described as resembling “carbon nano tubes.” Additionally present in mycondition were “tunneling fibers” that were very painful to extract. These wereusually a transparent off-white, “yellowish” color that resembled the nylonmaterial of fishing line. Less commonly, red-colored “tunneling” fibers weredeeper within the lesions. It was not uncommon for any of these fibers toeventually reach the surface of a lesion as it aged and become covered over withwhat has been described as a “callous” among Morgellons sufferers. In my ownchronic case, the non-tunneling fibers described above eventually became presentin my ears, nose, and sinuses as well. The Eustachian tubes became blocked byyeast-like growths. My lymph glands were in a constant swollen state, as was mythyroid, to the point of being easily visible through my throat. The combinationof the swollen glands and thyroid created an uncomfortable restriction of thethroat, but not to the point of restricting breathing. The yeast-like growthhardened as it exited the Eustachian tubes and created irritation by rubbing inthe swollen throat.As my condition improved over the course of following the SSKI protocol fortreating sporotrichosis, my navel became involved, and expelled a large mass ofapparent fungal “yeast-like” growth with a “horsetail” of coarse fibers growingfrom it . I found that as the infection was being treated internally with theSSKI, I had greater numbers of eruptions on the skin surface, but the materialshowed no activity and appeared to be dead or drying out.The lesions seemed tohave healed in the reverse order of which they appeared, ending on my arms andshins.Despite the length and chronic level of my infection, there was apparently nopermanent damage after treatment, aside from scarring relating to freezing thelesions. There was no apparent involvement of major organs, to include thelungs. ___________________________________________________________DiscussionIn the approximately two and a half years since learning of SSKI and followingthe protocol for treatment of sprotrichosis, I am now in good health. I am now a55 year old white male, clear of symptoms of the “Morgellons” condition, withthe rare exception of the occasional fiber exiting the skin as an artifact thatcannot be absorbed by the body. After what has amounted to over 17 years ofexamining the physical properties of the condition from the early stages tochronic, and ultimately learning that it responds to SSKI as treatment, Ibelieve my journey and insights are valid and worthy of your consideration inorder to help others who suffer from this much misunderstood condition.I posit that the condition that has come to be known as “Morgellons” couldlikely be an infection from a member of the dimorphic fungal family, eitheruncommon enough that the symptoms are not recognizable in the western medicalcommunity, or perhaps even one that has only recently made the evolutionary leapto human pathogen to the same medical result. The condition apparently entersthrough a break in the skin and eventually affects the hair follicles as thesource for creating the growth environment in the skin. I believe that thecondition can have no noticeable effect on the body for years , or even decades,as the final location to heal on my own body was the scar of a minor injury fromchildhood, which I remember as very troublesome at the time and at the end of mycurrent healing, broke open and ejected a few fibers and dead “ yeast-like ”growths.According to Mold and Bacteria Consulting Laboratories, “dimorphic fungus” isdefined as: (3)Dimorphic Fungi: What Are They?Dimorphic fungi are those fungi that exist either in yeast form or as mold(mycelial form) depending on environmental conditions, physiological conditionsof the fungus or the genetic characteristics.As yeasts, dimorphic fungi exist as single cells and multiply by old cellsproducing daughter cells. Dimorphism is common with some members of the majordivisions of the fungal kingdom, i.e., Zygomycota, Ascomycota, Basidiomycota,and mitosporic fungi.Some dimorphic fungi will switch to yeast or mold form depending on theprevailing temperature. These fungi are referred to as thermally dimorphic.Others will switch to yeast if they grow inside host tissues.I have witnessed these exact behaviors in my own chronic condition and suggestthat the parallels are obvious enough , in the later stages of the infection ,that a first year mycology student could recognize it as a fungal infection; alesion with a raised circumference that exhibits unusual fiber and growthactivity . It eventually covers itself with a secondary mold growth as theinfection changes according to host temperature, from the fibers and yeast-likegrowths of the internal infection of the dermis and epidermis, to a hard moldgrowth as the infection adjusts to the lower temperatures of the outer skin.While the condition initially, as reported by morgellons sufferers, presentsitself in varying ways, be it black specks expelled from the skin,or tiny whitefibers, or the small pimple-like eruptions on the surface of the skin, theinfection ultimately seems to culminate in various types of fiber growths insideof a yeast growth environment within a lesion in the skin and then covers with atough “callous” growth above the skin. From my own examinations, I recognizedthe pattern of the growths to be what is described in mycology as the “pilotwheel” formation of smaller yeast growths forming around one larger growth inthe center, in this case, varying in overall diameter from 1/4 inch to as muchas 3/8 inch overall. Over the course of successfully treating my own condition with SSKI, I came tothink of the condition as being “three-pronged,” with the internal infectionbeing number one, the lesions being number two, and the surface mold or“callous” on those lesions being number three. The SSKI effectively stopped theinternal infection and related internal complaints within the typical 8 to 10week period described in the medical literature for treating sporotrichosis withSSKI . I could tell this simply by the fact that my internal complaints wereeither gone or substantially decreased and apparently mending. In the medicalliterature, however, it is discussed that the high dosages should be continueduntil external symptoms are gone. I did not find this a good choice as mylesions were so severely infected with fibers and yeast growths that healingexternally lingered well beyond the time that my internal symptoms were gone,and in some cases, took as long as two years from the date of beginning the SSKIprotocol to fully heal. Due to the fact that effects of long term use of highdosage SSKI is undetermined, I stopped taking the very high doses of fiftydrops, 3 times per day, after approximately six months. I found that, after theinternal infection was eliminated, a reduced dosage of 2 to 5 drops of SSKI perday still affected the existing lesions to eventually end them. As the lesions healed, the topical mold or “callous” became very aggressive andbegan growing many of the fine white fibers that I believe to be reproductivehypha. The transitional growths between the soft,yeast-like growths and the outer mold tend to be in the shape of “hard spikes”that are embedded in the skin, and the callous seems to grow from them. These“spikes” have come to be known in Morgellons sufferers’ jargon as “cat’s claw.”When a callous is forcefully removed, these spikes will be present and visibleon its bottom side. Typical fungicides prescribed for conditions such asringworm are ineffective against this mold and the most effective agent I foundfor use on it was a simple paste made of organic turmeric and water, althougheven that is not effective enough to kill it outright. Using SSKI topically doesaffect the growths, but stings substantially as it is literally a case ofputting salt in a wound and the amount of discomfort makes it not recommended,in my opinion.Absolute healing in my case was only found over time, taking 2 to 5 drops perday of SSKI after following the protocol for sporotrichosis to eliminate theinternal infection. As noted in the cited document, (2) reinfection is possible,and I believe I may have dealt with that occurrence. I found that limitingsweets and alcohol in my diet aided in speeding my recovery, while working toregain mobility and allowing my immune system to eventually reject all of theforeign material as it died out. I strongly believe that the external infectionis reliant on the internal infection for survival and that the externalinfection is not opportunistic. During my time of infection, I had suffered afew injuries and did not find that the condition had migrated to those woundsfrom injury. ___________________________________________________________SummaryMy best argument for considering the “Morgellons” condition as a dimorphicfungal pathogen is simply the apparent parallels in the conditions and the factthat the known SSKI treatment for those infections has been effective in myselfand many others known to me. I suggest that the commonly described protocol forusing SSKI as treatment for sporotrichosis is apparently effective in theMorgellons condition. The known treatment for use of SSKI for sporotrichosis isdescribed as beginning with 5 drops of SSKI, 3 times per day, and graduallyincreasing the drop count to as many as 12 to 15 drops three times per day, asthe patient becomes accustomed to it, to a total 2g to 3g of SSKI per day. Idon’t believe it is necessary to try to take the high dosages for any more thanapproximately 10 weeks. Following up with 2 to 5 drops, once per day wassatisfactory for keeping the potassium iodide in the system to continueaffecting the existing lesions as they continued to heal. Treating topicallywith the antifungal component of your choice to keep the topical condition incheck until the condition dies away and the immune system rejects any remainingmaterial would be at your discretion. It is important to be certain that anyoneconsidering following this protocol does not have any of the conditions thatpreclude SSKI use to include, but not limited to high blood pressure medicationscontaining potassium, Hashimoto’s disease or other medically known issuescontraindicated for the use of SSKI.I suggest that for whatever the reason, the medical communities inEnglish-speaking countries are not equipped to recognize these fungalconditions. Even a cursory look into the subject of human pathogen dimorphicfungi online suggests that these conditions are already epidemic in Brazil,Peru, and other South American countries, and that the medical communities thereare at the forefront in utilizing solutions of potassium iodide as an effectiveand economical way to confront the problem. I believe that the specific answersto exactly what strain of fungal pathogen has become epidemic in The US, if notpandemic around the world, will not be answered until it is adequately addressedby the medical mycology community, to bring it to the attention of mainstreammedical practitioners.References1.) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3754371/[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3754371/]2.)
