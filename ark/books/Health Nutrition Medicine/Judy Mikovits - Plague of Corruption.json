Kennedy, Jr.“And yet, it moves!” Galileo whispered those defiant words in 1615 as he leftthe Roman Inquisition tribunal before which he repudiated his theory that theEarth—the immovable center of the Universe according to contemporaryorthodoxy—revolves around the sun. Had he not recanted, his life would beforfeit. We like to think of Galileo’s struggles as the quaint artifact of adark, ignorant, and tyrannical era where individuals challengedgovernment-anointed superstitions only at grave personal risk. Dr. JudyMikovits’ story shows that stubborn orthodoxies anointed by pharmaceuticalcompanies and corrupt government regulators to protect power and profits remaina dominant force in science and politics.By any standard, Dr. Judy Mikovits was among the most skilled scientists of hergeneration. She entered professional science from the University of Virginiawith a BA degree in chemistry on June 10, 1980, as a protein chemist for theNational Cancer Institute (NCI) working on a life-saving project to purifyinterferon. The quality of her work and her reliable flashes of genius soonpropelled her to the apex of the male-dominated world of scientific research. AtNCI, Mikovits began what would become a twenty-year collaboration with Dr. FrankRuscetti, a pioneer in the field of human retrovirology. While heading up thelab of Robert Gallo in 1977, Ruscetti made scientific history by codiscoveringwith Bernie Poiesz the first human retrovirus, HTLV-1 (human T-cell leukemiavirus). A retrovirus is a “stealth virus” that, like HIV, enters the hostwithout alerting the immune systems. It may then lie dormant for years withoutcausing harm. Before killing a person, a retrovirus will usually destroy theirimmune system. As a result, many retroviruses cause cancer. With an escalatingunderstanding of retrovirus behavior, the Ruscetti/ Mikovits collaboration andMikovits’s award-winning PhD thesis from George Washington University in 1991changed the paradigm of HIV-AIDS treatment, turning the disease from a deathsentence into a manageable condition.From the outset, the most daunting obstacle to Mikovits’ career advancement washer scientific integrity. She always placed it ahead of personal ambition. JudyMikovits never meant to wade into a public health brawl. She never consideredherself a renegade or revolutionary. Judy’s relatives mainly worked ingovernment or law enforcement. They believed in the bedrock American principlesof hard work, respect for authority, and, above all, telling the truth. Thatbackdrop made it impossible for her to abandon her high natal standards ofhonesty and integrity even when they became a hindrance.After leaving NIH, she worked a stint for Upjohn—leading a project to prove thesafety of the company’s blockbuster Bovine Growth Hormone. When Mikovitsdiscovered the company’s formula could cause precancerous changes in human cellcultures, she refused direct orders from her boss to hide her discoveries.Mikovits’ revelation suggested that the ubiquitous presence of the hormone inmilk could lead to breast cancer in women who drank it. Her refusal to back downprecipitated her departure from Upjohn and her return to NIH and graduateschool. Judy’s war on BGH eventually led to Upjohn abandoning the product.In 2009, now in academia, Mikovits and Ruscetti, who was still at NCI, led ateam that discovered a strong association between a previously unknownretrovirus and myalgic encephalomyelitis, commonly known as chronic fatiguesyndrome (ME/CFS). Predictably, the retrovirus was also linked to certain bloodcancers. Collaborators had named it Xenotropic Murine Leukemia Related Virus(XMRV), when they first detected in DNA sequences in prostate cancer a few yearsearlier.The medical community had dealt with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, which strikesmostly women, in bad faith since its appearance in the mid-1980s. The medicalestablishment derided ME/CFS as “yuppie flu” and attributed it to the inherentpsychological fragility of career women pursuing professions in high-pressurecorporate ecosystems. Mikovits found evidence for the retrovirus inapproximately 67 percent of women afflicted with ME/CFS, and in a little lessthan 4 percent of the healthy population.On October 8, 2009, Mikovits and Ruscetti published their explosive findings inthe journal Science, describing the first-ever isolation of the recentlydiscovered retrovirus XMRV, and its association to ME/CFS. Her revelation aboutME/CFS immediately triggered angry reactions from jealous cancer power centers,stubbornly resistant to science that attributed cancer and neuroimmune diseasesto viruses.The blowback grew even grimmer when Mikovits’ subsequent research suggested thatthe new retrovirus, originally found in mice, had somehow jumped into humans viacontaminated vaccines.Even more troubling to the medical establishment, Dr. Mikovits’ researchrevealed that many of the female patients afflicted with XMRV had children withautism. Suspecting XMRV might be passed from mother to child, as with HIV,Mikovits tested seventeen of the children. Fourteen showed evidence of thevirus. Those findings dovetailed with parental reports of autistic regressionfollowing vaccination. Subsequent studies linked XMRV to epidemics in leukemia,prostate cancer, autoimmune disease, and the explosion of Alzheimer’s disease.Worse yet, research also found widespread XMRV contamination in the blood supplyand blood products. Based on her research and the findings of others, it seemedthat anywhere from 3 to 8 percent of the population now carry the virus—XMRV hasbecome part of human ecology, passed from mother to child in vitro or throughbreast milk. Mikovits’ data suggest that more than ten million Americans areharboring this virus like a ticking time bomb—a potential threat far greaterthan the HIV-AIDS epidemic.In January of 2011, HIV-AIDS expert Ben Berkhout published these explosiverevelations in the journal Frontiers in Microbiology. He included Mikovits’evidence that mouse tissue used in vaccine production was the likely vector forhuman contamination. Unbeknownst to Judy, her co-author on this book, KentHeckenlively, had already independently discovered published medical researchshowing that the first recorded outbreak of ME/CFS was among 198 doctors andnurses at the Los Angeles County Hospital in 1934–1935, following theirinjection with an experimental polio vaccine grown in mouse brain tissue.Mikovits’ evidence threatened financial catastrophe for the world’spharmaceutical companies because of their negligent use of animal cell culturesto produce vaccines and other pharmaceutical products. Her findings put at riskbillions of dollars of revenues from an entire branch of medicine called“biologics,” which depends on animal tissue and products.Pharmaceutical companies and their captive regulators unleashed a furiousbroadside against Mikovits and Ruscetti, besieging them from every stronghold.The journal Science feverishly pressed Mikovits to retract her October 2009article. In September of 2011, the Whittemore Peterson Institute at theUniversity of Nevada, Reno, fired Judy from her faculty job. Judy and her familynoticed menacing-looking men following her in pickup trucks and other incidentsindicating she was under surveillance. In one incident, burley thugs surroundedher home and forced her to flee in a boat. After she escaped, they barged intoher home, claiming to work for the government. In November, Ventura Policearrested Judy without a warrant and held her in jail for five days without bail.The police searched her house from top to bottom, strewing her paperseverywhere. That same day, cops raided the home of her friend, Lilly, and forcedher to sit in a chair for several hours while they ransacked the building. NIHofficials told Nevada police that Dr. Mikovits had illegally taken her researchnotebooks from their lab. This was a fabricated charge. As the principalinvestigator on two government grants, it was Dr. Mikovits’ obligation to retainall of her research papers . . . Furthermore, Judy had left all of the notebooksin her university office on September 29. That same day, someone illegallyburglarized Judy’s office, removed her notebooks, and then somehow planted themin a closet of her home, apparently to incriminate her. Weeks later, as Judylanguished in a cell, her husband, David, found the journals neatly packed in alinen beach bag in an obscure closet in her Southern California home. Davidfrantically took them to the jail after midnight and then handed them over toVentura Police.While she was in jail, Judy’s former boss told her husband and Dr. Ruscetti thatif she just signed an apology admitting her paper was wrong, the police wouldrelease her from confinement and she could salvage her science career. Judyrefused. No prosecutor has ever filed charges against her, but thepharmaceutical cartel and its captive scientific journals launched a campaign ofvilification against her. Less than two years earlier, the journal Science hadcelebrated her. Now, the same journal published her mug shot and retracted herpaper.Judy lost federal grants for which she was the principal investigator. She hasgone bankrupt trying to find work and restore her good name. The scientificjournals, admittedly all now controlled by Big Pharma, have refused to publishher papers. The NIH medical libraries have locked her out. Despite spendinghundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees, she has not been able to get herday in court. The US Attorney in Nevada has kept the case “under seal” foryears. Fraudulent acts of public health officials at the highest levels ofHealth and Human Services (HHS) have effectively rendered her unemployable.The persecution of scientists and doctors who dare to challenge contemporaryorthodoxies did not take a rest after Galileo: it has always been, and remainstoday, an occupational hazard. Henrik Ibsen’s 1882 play An Enemy of the Peopleis a parable for the pitfall of scientific integrity. Ibsen tells the story of adoctor in southern Norway who discovers that his town’s popular and lucrativepublic baths were actually sickening the visitors who flocked to them forrejuvenation. Discharges from local tanneries had infected the spas with lethalbacteria. When the doctor goes public with the information, local merchants,joined by government officials, their allies in the “liberal-minded independentpress,” and other financially interested parties move to muzzle him. The medicalestablishment pulls his medical license, the townsfolk vilify and brand him “anenemy of the people.”Ibsen’s fictional doctor experienced what social scientists call the “Semmelweisreflex.” This term describes the knee-jerk revulsion with which the press, themedical and scientific community, and allied financial interests greet newscientific evidence that contradicts an established scientific paradigm. Thereflex can be particularly fierce in cases where new scientific informationsuggests that established medical practices are actually harming public health.The real-life plight of Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician, inspired theterm and Ibsen’s play. In 1847, Dr. Semmelweis was an assistant professor atVienna’s General Hospital maternity clinic, where around 10 percent of womendied from puerperal “birth bed” fever. Based on his pet theory that cleanlinesscould mitigate transmission of disease-causing “particles,” Semmelweisintroduced the practice of mandatory hand washing for interns between performingautopsies and delivering babies. The rate of fatal puerperal fever immediatelydropped to around 1 percent. Semmelweis published these findings.Rather than building a statue to Semmelweis, the medical community, unwilling toadmit culpability in the injury of so many patients, expelled the doctor fromthe medical profession. His former colleagues tricked Dr. Semmelweis intovisiting a mental institution in 1865, then committed him against his will.Semmelweis died mysteriously two weeks later. A decade afterward, LouisPasteur’s germ theory and Joseph Lister’s work on hospital sanitation vindicatedSemmelweis’s ideas.Modern analogs abound. Herbert Needleman of the University of Pittsburgh enduredthe Semmelweis reflex when he revealed the brain-killing toxicity of lead in the1980s. Needleman published a groundbreaking study in 1979 in the New EnglandJournal of Medicine showing that children with high levels of lead in theirteeth scored significantly lower than their peers on intelligence tests, onauditory and speech processing, and on attention measurements. Beginning in theearly 1980s, the lead and oil industries (leaded gasoline was a lucrativepetroleum product) mobilized public relations firms and scientific and medicalconsultants to lambast Needleman’s research and his credibility. Industrypressured the Environmental Protection Agency, the Office of ScientificIntegrity at the National Institutes of Health, and the University of Pittsburghto launch investigations against Needleman. Ultimately the federal governmentand the University vindicated Needleman. But the impact of the industry’sscathing assault ruined Needleman’s academic career and stagnated the field oflead research. The episode offered an enduring demonstration of industry powerto disrupt the lives of researchers who dare to question their products’ safety.Rachel Carson ran the same gauntlet in the early 1960s when she exposed thedangers of Monsanto’s DDT pesticide, which the medical community then promotedas prophylactic against body lice and malaria. Government officials and medicalprofessionals led by the American Medical Association joined Monsanto and otherchemical manufacturers, attacking Carson viciously. Trade journals and thepopular media disparaged her as a “hysterical woman.” Industry talking pointsderided Carson as a “spinster,” the contemporary euphemism for lesbian, and forbeing unscientific. Vicious criticisms of her book appeared in editorial pagesin Time, Life, Newsweek, the Saturday Evening Post, US News and World Report,and even Sports Illustrated. I am immensely proud that my uncle, President JohnF. Kennedy, played a critical role in vindicating Carson. In 1962, he defied hisown USDA, a captive agency in league with Monsanto, and appointed a panel ofindependent scientists who validated every material assertion in Carson’s bookSilent Spring.The experience of British physician and epidemiologist Alice Stewart offers anear-perfect analogy to the Medical cartel’s lynching of Judy Mikovits. In the1940s, Stewart was one of the rare women in her profession and the youngestfellow ever elected at the time to the Royal College of Physicians. She beganinvestigating the high occurrences of childhood cancers in well-to-do families,a puzzling phenomenon given that disease often correlated with poverty, andseldom with affluence. Stewart published a paper in The Lancet in 1956 offeringstrong evidence that the common practice of giving X-rays to pregnant women wasthe culprit in carcinomas that would later afflict their children. According toMargaret Heffernan, author of Willful Blindness, Stewart’s finding “flew in theface of conventional wisdom”—the medical profession’s enthusiasm for the newtechnology of X-rays—as well as “doctors’ idea of themselves, which was aspeople who helped patients.” A coalition of government regulators, nuclearpromoters, and the nuclear industry joined the US and British medicalestablishments in launching a brutal attack on Stewart. Stewart, who died in2002 at the age of ninety-five, never again received another major researchgrant in England. It took twenty-five years after the publication of Stewart’spaper for the medical establishment to finally acknowledge her findings andabandon the practice of X-raying expectant mothers.Judy Mikovits is heir to these martyrs and, more directly, to a long line ofscientists, whom public health officials have punished, exiled, and ruinedspecifically for committing heresy against reigning vaccine orthodoxies.Dr. Bernice Eddy was an award-winning virologist, and one of the highest-rankingfemale scientists in NIH history. She and her research partner Elizabeth Stewartwere the first researchers to isolate the Polyomavirus— the first virus provento cause cancer. In 1954, NIH asked Eddy to direct testing of the Salk poliovaccine. She discovered, while testing eighteen macaques, that Salk’s vaccinecontained residual live polio virus that was paralyzing the monkeys. Dr. Eddywarned her NIH bosses that the vaccine was virulent, but they dismissed herconcerns. The distribution of that vaccine by Cutter Labs in California causedthe worst polio outbreak in history. Health officials infected 200,000 peoplewith live polio; 70,000 became sick, leaving 200 children paralyzed and tendead.In 1961, Eddy discovered that a cancer-causing monkey virus, SV40, hadcontaminated ninety-eight million Salk polio vaccines. When she injected theSV40 virus into newborn hamsters, the rodents sprouted tumors. Eddy’s discoveryproved an embarrassment to many scientists working on the vaccine. Instead ofrewarding her for her visionary work, NIH officials banned her from polioresearch and assigned her to other duties. The NIH buried the alarminginformation and continued using the vaccines.In the autumn of 1960, the New York Cancer Society invited Eddy to address itsannual conference. Eddy chose the subject of tumors induced by the polyomavirus. However, she also described tumors induced by the SV40 viral agent inmonkey kidney cells. Her NIH supervisor angrily reprimanded Eddy for mentioningthe discovery publicly and banned her from public health crisis statements. Eddyargued for publication of her work on the virus, casting the contaminatedvaccine supply on an urgent public health crisis. Agency bigwigs stonewalledpublication, allowing Merck and Parke-Davis to continue marketing the oncogenicvaccine to millions of American adults and children.On July 26, 1961, the New York Times reported that Merck and Parke-Davis werewithdrawing their Salk vaccines. The article said nothing about cancer. TheTimes ran the story next to an account about overdue library fines on page 33.While two drug companies, Merck and Parke-Davis, recalled their polio vaccine in1961, NIH officials refused to pursue a total recall of the rest of the supply,fearing reputational injury to the vaccine program if Americans learned that PHShad infected them with a cancer-producing virus. As a result, millions ofunsuspecting Americans received carcinogenic vaccines between 1961 and 1963. ThePublic Health Service then concealed that “secret” for forty years.In total, ninety-eight million Americans received shots potentially containingthe cancer-producing virus, which is now part of the human genome. In 1996,government researchers identified SV-40 in 23 percent of the blood specimens and45 percent of the sperm specimens collected from healthy adults. Six percent ofthe children born between 1980 and 1995 are infected. Public health officialsgave millions of people the vaccine for years after they knew it was infected.They contaminated humanity with a monkey virus and refused to admit what they’ddone.Today, SV-40 is used in research laboratories throughout the world because it isso reliably carcinogenic. Researchers use it to produce a wide variety of boneand soft-tissue cancers including mesothelioma and brain tumors in animals.These cancers have exploded in the baby boom generation, which received the Salkand Sabin polio vaccines between 1955 and 1963. Skin cancers are up by 70percent, lymphoma and prostate by 66 percent, and brain cancer by 34 percent.Prior to 1950, mesothelioma was rare in humans. Today, doctors diagnose nearly3,000 Americans with mesotheliomas every year; 60 percent of the tumors thatwere tested contained SV-40. Today, scientists find SV-40 in a wide range ofdeadly tumors, including between 33 percent and 90 percent of brain tumors,eight of eight ependymomas, and nearly half of the bone tumors tested.In successive measures, NIH forbade Bernice Eddy from speaking publicly orattending scholarly conferences, held up her papers, removed her from vaccineresearch altogether, and eventually destroyed her animals and took away accessto her labs. Her treatment continues to mark an enduring scandal with thescientific community, yet NIH’s Bernice Eddy playbook has become a standardizedtemplate for Federal vaccine regulators in their treatment of dissident vaccinescientists who seek to tell the truth about vaccines.Dr. John Anthony Morris was a bacteriologist and virologist who worked forthirty-six years at NIH and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), beginning in1940. Morris served as the chief vaccine officer for the Bureau of BiologicalStandards (BBS) at the National Institute of Health and later with the FDA whenthe BBS transferred to that agency in the 1970s. Dr. Morris irked his superiorsby arguing that the research carried out by his unit demonstrated there was noreliable proof that flu vaccines were effective in preventing influenza; inparticular, he accused his supervisor of basing HHS’s mass vaccination programfor the swine flu primarily on a scientifically baseless fear campaign and onfalse claims made by pharmaceutical manufacturers. He warned that the vaccinewas dangerous and could induce neurological injuries. His CDC superior warnedDr. Morris, “I would advise you not to talk about this.”When vaccine recipients began reporting adverse reactions, includingGuillain-Barré, Dr. Morris disobeyed that order and went public. He declaredthat the flu vaccine was ineffective and potentially dangerous and said that hecould find no evidence that this swine flu was dangerous or that it would spreadfrom human to human.In retaliation, FDA officials confiscated his research materials, changed thelocks on his laboratory, reassigned his laboratory staff, and blocked hisefforts to publish his findings. The FDA assigned Dr. Morris to a small roomwith no telephone. Anyone who wished to see him had to secure permission fromthe chief of the lab. In 1976, HHS fired Dr. Morris on the pretext that hefailed to return library books on time.Subsequent events supported Dr. Morris’s skepticism about the swine flu shot.The 1976 swine flu vaccination program was so fraught with problems that thegovernment discontinued inoculations after forty-nine million people hadreceived the vaccine. Among the vaccine’s victims were 500 cases ofGuillain-Barré, including 200 people paralyzed and thirty-three dead.Furthermore, the incidence of swine flu among vaccinated was seven times greaterthan among those who were unvaccinated, according to news reports.According to his New York Times obituary, Dr. Morris said, “The producers ofthese (influenza) vaccines know they are worthless, but they go on selling themanyway.” He told the Washington Post in 1979, “It’s a medical ripoff. . . . Ibelieve the public should have truthful information on the basis of which theycan determine whether or not to take the vaccine,” adding, “I believe that givenfull information, they won’t take the vaccine.”FDA used the same playbook in 2002 to isolate, silence, and drive fromgovernment service its star epidemiologist, Dr. Bart Classen, when his massiveepidemiologic studies, the largest ever performed, linked Hib vaccines to thejuvenile diabetes epidemic. FDA ordered Dr. Classen to refrain from publishingthe government-funded studies, forbade him from talking publicly about thealarming outbreak, and eventually forced him out of government service.In 1995, the CDC hired a PhD computer analytics expert, Dr. Gary Goldman, toperform the largest-ever CDC-funded study of the chickenpox vaccine. Goldman’sresults on an isolated population of 300,000 residents of Antelope Valley,California, showed that the vaccine waned, leading to dangerous outbreaks ofchickenpox in adults and that ten-year-old children who received the vaccinewere getting shingles at over three times the rate of unvaccinated children.Shingles has twenty times the death rate of chickenpox and causes blindness. CDCordered Goldman to hide his findings and forbade him from publishing his data.In 2002, Goldman resigned in protest. He sent a letter to his bosses saying thathe was resigning because “I refuse to participate in research fraud.”Recent medical history overflows with other examples of the brutal suppressionof any science that exposes vaccines’ risks; its casualties include brilliantand compassionate doctors and scientists like Dr. Waney Squier, the railroadedBritish gastroenterologist Andy Wakefield, the steadfast father/son researchteam David and Dr. Mark Geier, Italian biochemist Antionetta Gatti, and Danishepidimiologist Peter Goetzsche. Any just society would have built statues tothese visionaries and honored them with laurels and leadership. Our corruptmedical officials have systematically disgraced and silenced them.In England a neuropathologist, Dr. Waney Squier of the Radcliffe Hospital inOxford, testified in a series of cases on behalf of defendants accused ofinflicting shaken baby syndrome. Squier believed that, in these cases, vaccinesand not physical trauma had caused the infants’ brain injuries. In March 2016,the Medical Practitioner’s Tribunal Service (MPTS) charged her with falsifyingevidence and lying and struck her from the medical register. Squier appealed thetribunal’s decision in November 2016. The High Court of England reversed theMPTS’s decision, concluding, “The determination of the MPTS is in manysignificant ways flawed.”Professor Peter Gøtzsche cofounded the Cochrane Collaboration in 1993 to remedythe overwhelming corruption of published science and scientists bypharmaceutical companies. Over 30,000 of the world’s leading scientists joinedCochrane as volunteer reviewers hoping to restore independence and integrity topublished science. Gøtzsche was responsible for making Cochrane the world’sleading independent research institute. He also founded the Nordic CochraneCenter in 2003. On October 29, 2018, pharmaceutical interests, led by BillGates, finally succeeded in ousting Professor Gøtzsche. A stacked boardcontrolled by Gates fired Gøtzsche from the Cochrane Collaboration after hepublished a well-founded criticism of the HPV vaccine. In 2018, the Danishgovernment, under pressure from pharma, fired Peter Gøtzsche from Rigshospitaletin Copenhagen. His findings about the HPV vaccine threatened the pharmaceuticalindustry’s earnings.Science, at its best, is a search for existential truth. Sometimes, however,those truths threaten powerful economic paradigms. Both science and democracyrely on the free flow of accurate information. Greedy corporations and captivegovernment regulators have consistently shown themselves willing to twist,distort, falsify, and corrupt science, hide information, and censor open debateto protect personal power and corporate profits. Censorship is the fatal enemyof both democracy and public health. Dr. Frank Ruscetti often quotes ValeryLegasov, the courageous Russian physicist who braved censor, torture, andthreats on his life by the KGB to reveal to the world the true cause of theChernobyl disaster. “To be a scientist is to be naïve. We are so focused on oursearch for the truth, we fail to consider how few actually want us to find it.But it is always there, whether we can see it or not, whether we choose to ornot. The truth doesn’t care about our needs or our wants. It doesn’t care aboutour governments, our ideologies, our religions. It will lie in wait for alltime.”This account by Judy Mikovits and Kent Heckenlively is vitally important both tothe health of our children and the vitality of our democracy. My father believedmoral courage to be the rarest species of bravery. Rarer even than the physicalcourage of soldiers in battle or great intelligence. He thought it the one vitalquality required to salvage the world.If we are to continue to enjoy democracy and protect our children from theforces that seek to commoditize humanity, then we need courageous scientistslike Judy Mikovits who are willing to speak truth to power, even at terriblepersonal cost."},{"pageContent":"Introductionimages [../Images/line.jpg]by Dr. Judy MikovitsI never imagined I’d become one of the most controversial figures intwenty-first century science.For me it was always about following the data and listening to the patients. Asscientists we’re supposed to solve problems and help humanity. That’s ourmission, the very purpose to which we’ve dedicated our lives.How is it that conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), autism,neurological diseases, and even cancer have become so controversial that many inmedicine turn away from looking at the possible root causes of these diseases?I don’t know why we can’t all just put our heads together and figure this out.Maybe some of my ideas are right and maybe some are wrong. Let’s put all theideas under the microscope and see what happens.When I was in a lab, making breakthrough discoveries, such as how to developAIDS drugs to solve our world’s greatest modern plague, the HIV-AIDS epidemic,it was never about glory or reputation.It was about changing people’s lives.That’s where I derive my greatest satisfaction.I don’t consider myself one who seeks the limelight. When I worked in a lab, Iwas usually in by five in the morning, often not leaving until six that night(unless there was a baseball game at Camden Yards). I read a lot of scientificarticles, trying to understand what the best minds in the field are finding.When I relax, I like to watch baseball, which explains why I often wear abaseball cap. It’s just more comfortable to me. I like other sports as well,basketball and football, and for many years I’ve belonged to what we jokinglycall the “Poor Boys Yacht Club” (actually, it’s the Pierpont Bay Yacht Club, butwe prefer PBYC) and enjoyed sailing on the Pacific Ocean with my husband and ourfriends. I participate in cancer support groups, using my knowledge as aresearcher to help people going through therapy by explaining options theirdoctors suggest.None of that explains why the police raided my house on a mid-November morningin 2011 and held me in jail without bail for five days. I didn’t murder anybody.I’m not the agent of a foreign power. In fact, I was never even tried for acrime, the allegation vanishing like an early morning California fog.What do I think was my real crime?Following the data and listening to the patients.We think the key to solving these questions really starts in 1934 in sunny LosAngeles, the City of Angels.image [../Images/common.jpg]Most experts agree that the first appearance of CFS in the United Statesoccurred in Los Angeles between 1934 and 1935. The outbreak affected 198doctors, nurses, medical technicians, and other workers at the Los AngelesCounty Hospital during a polio outbreak.Oddly enough, only hospital staff contracted CFS, and the patients managed toavoid it.Doesn’t that sound like a clue to you?The signs and symptoms were puzzling. The patients were easily fatigued upon theslightest exertion, had nausea, light sensitivity, loss of balance, episodes ofparalysis followed by difficulty in lifting their limbs, breathing problems,headaches, shooting pains, and insomnia, in addition to difficulties withconcentration and memory. The victims suffered from crushing depression followedby euphoria, spells of weeping for no apparent reason, and often showed violentmanifestations of dislike for people or things they had previously liked.1[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn101_1] It was as if their bodies and brains hadbetrayed them.I entered the picture in May of 2006, when I heard a lecture from a researcherwho noted that long-time sufferers of CFS had elevated rates of very rare typesof cancer. It smelled like a virus to me, the same way HIV (humanimmunodeficiency virus) often kills its victims through the accompanying AIDS(acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) and the various cancers and other problemsthat their immune system could no longer handle.The HIV-AIDS epidemic, which ravaged the planet in the 1980s and 1990s, killingmore than thirty-five million people by the latest count, serves as an importantcounterpoint to the CFS epidemic. CFS seemed to explode in the 1980s, startingwith an outbreak in Lake Tahoe on the California/Nevada border from 1984 to1985, striking first the teachers at a local high school, then moving into themore urban areas of San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York. From theselocations it spread across the country. At that time, the dogma was HIV-AIDSonly affected men, so CFS was often called non-HIV-AIDS.HIV-AIDS killed its patients over the course of several years. CFS kept itsvictims alive, but in a state akin to hibernation. Friends and family memberswould often tell the patients they “looked great” and maybe just “needed to getout more” and try to “reduce their stress.” Many of the same immune markers wereabnormal in both groups, but the outcomes were very different.Those with CFS remained alive but often longed for the release of death.image [../Images/common.jpg]In science the first outbreak of a disease is usually closely examined forpossible clues.The researcher asks, what factors do those with the disease share? I’m sureyou’ve seen that same protocol followed in countless books, movies, andtelevision shows.The same thing happened, at least initially, with that first outbreak of CFSamong the hospital staff in Los Angeles in 1934–1935. The investigators whohappened to be on hand when this new disease first appeared were Dr. John R.Paul, a Yale Medical School professor, and Dr. Leslie Webster, a physician withthe Rockefeller Institute of New York.In a book published in 1971 about the history of polio, Dr. Paul devoted anentire chapter to this new disease, which came to be known as CFS but earlierwas called myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME). ME literally means inflammation ofthe brain and spinal cord. Many people refer to this disease as chronic fatiguesyndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis or CFS/ME. Others think that it should bemore accurately referred to as ME/CFS. Fatigue is a symptom of many diseases,and I think the use of this term has hindered the science and marginalized thepatients for four decades. The community of patients prefers the term ME/CFS,and I will use it in this book.Even decades later, Dr. Paul seemed to be haunted by what he had seen duringthis first outbreak of ME/CFS and its possible origin. Had they missed somethingof critical importance? Paul wrote:Nonetheless the Los Angeles episode is a reminder that even those who believethemselves to be experts occasionally ride for a fall, although they may beextremely loathe to admit it, especially to their patients. It is sometimes thebitterest pill they have to swallow. The members of our team of investigatorshad somehow failed to recognize the treachery of the situation and had notemphasized sufficiently the possibility of a hysterical element or the intrusionof a polio-like illness on the scene. As a weak excuse, it may be said that wehad our hearts so set on isolating poliovirus that we could think of littleelse.2 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn101_2]I often find myself longing for the honesty and self-reflection of researcherslike Dr. Paul, although I suspect he was also keeping a few secrets of his own.As I reflect on the controversy our work has generated, I wonder what Paul meantby “the treachery of the situation.” How could the search for the truth about adisease involve treachery?Surely a virus does not care what scientists discover about it.The question remains, what could science possibly be hiding?image [../Images/common.jpg]Kent Heckenlively, the coauthor of my previous book, PLAGUE, and with whom Iworked again on this book, found a possible answer.Kent discovered published medical research indicating that the entire medicalstaff at the Los Angeles County General Hospital had received an early poliovaccine developed by Dr. Maurice Brodie, in collaboration with the RockefellerInstitute of New York.3 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn101_3] The polio virus waspassaged multiple times through mouse brain tissue. The use of mouse tissue togrow viruses was new in the 1930s, only previously having been used in thedevelopment of a Yellow Fever vaccine.4 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn101_4] Inaddition, the medical staff was given an accompanying immune system booster,preserved with thimerosal, a mercury derivative.5[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn101_5]Kent also uncovered the transcript of a lecture given by Dr. G. Stuart aboutproblems with the Yellow Fever vaccine and its mouse components to a gatheringof the World Health Organization in 1953 in Uganda:[T]wo main objections to this vaccine have been voiced, because of thepossibility that: (i) the mouse brains employed in its preparations may becontaminated with a virus pathogenic for man although latent in mice . . . ormay be the cause of demyelinating encephalomyelitis; (ii) the use, as antigen,of a virus with enhanced neurotropic properties may be followed by seriousreactions involving the central nervous system.6[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn101_6]I remind you that the scientific name for CFS is myalgic encephalomyelitis. A“virus with enhanced neurotropic properties” that could cause “serious reactionsinvolving the central nervous system”? Sounds like the plot of a terrifyingscience-fiction movie.But this was a presentation made to the World Health Organization!“Is this how it could have happened?” Kent asked. “By using animal tissue togrow viruses they were picking up other viruses from those animals and injectingthem into human beings as passengers in vaccines?”I could only reply that it was a good question. I consider it acknowledgedscience that the passage of human viruses through different animal species, suchas mice, rabbits, dogs, or monkeys, often results in a less pathogenic virus,which might be used in a vaccine. However, the question of whether other animalviruses were hitching a ride in that biological material was less clear.I asked my long-time collaborator and mentor, Dr. Frank Ruscetti, what hethought of this question. He replied he’d asked the same question as a youngresearcher and been told that the human immune system was superior to any animalviruses that might hitch a ride along with the vaccine. He was also told by JohnCoffin, a few years older than Frank, in the tone of a know-it-all olderbrother, “Don’t bother to look for human retroviruses. They don’t exist.”Frank said his first reaction was “that’s preposterous.” Even from the start,John Coffin was a fountain of bad ideas and misguided advice. I would have myown fights with Coffin and share Frank’s opinion.Frank went on to discover the first-known disease-causing human retrovirus,HTLV-1, (human T-cell leukemia virus), along with Robert Gallo and BerniePoiesz, and the field of human retrovirology was born. Like most engineers ofdisaster throughout history, Coffin was “often wrong, but never in doubt.”image [../Images/common.jpg]Did researchers in the 1930s understand what they might have done?In her book Osler’s Web, detailing the course of the ME/CFS outbreak starting inthe mid-1980s, journalist Hillary Johnson recounted how she had been told by aCanadian researcher that the 198 victims of the initial outbreak in Los Angelesof 1934–1935 had received a settlement of approximately six million dollars.This settlement was supposedly made somewhere around 1939.7[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn101_7]Kent did some investigation as to who might have made such a payment in 1939,which in today’s dollars would amount to more than a hundred million dollars.Who had that kind of money during the Great Depression? Kent suspected theRockefeller Institute, since they had partially funded the first use of mousetissue for vaccines. He also found a curious pattern from their public financialreports. In 1935, the Rockefeller Foundation reported assets of over a hundredand fifty-three million dollars. But after 1939 it had shrunk to just over ahundred and forty-six million dollars, a loss of more than seven milliondollars.8 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn101_8] Variations in the years before andafter this period tended to be less than fifty thousand dollars.This is circumstantial evidence, but it could potentially explain why there wasso little scientific follow-up in the medical literature for the initial victimsof the Los Angeles outbreak.image [../Images/common.jpg]We knew none of this when, on October 8, 2009, we published explosive findingsin the journal Science, describing the first-ever isolation of a recentlydiscovered retrovirus, XMRV (Xenotropic Murine Leukemia Virus-Related Virus) andits association to ME/CFS.9 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn101_9] We found evidencefor the retrovirus in approximately 67 percent of those afflicted with ME/CFS,and in a little less than 4 percent of the healthy population.While this was welcome news to those suffering from ME/CFS, it also meant thatmore than ten million Americans were harboring this virus like a ticking timebomb. What might awaken this virus in human beings and cause disease?We suspected immune activation, since retroviruses like to hide out in themonocytes, B and T cells of the immune system. Because of our previous researchin HIV-AIDS, we knew that the standard of care for children born to HIV-infectedmothers was that their babies be immediately put on antiretroviral drugs priorto any vaccination. The very act of immune stimulation by a vaccine was likelyto cause the HIV virus to replicate out of the control of the immune system andcause the fatal consequence of AIDS.There’s one important point I need to make about HIV among retroviruses. Forthose who were diagnosed with HIV in the 1980s, it meant a death sentence. Thosewho survived had a unique genetic profile, which we came to call “elitecontrollers.” Most retroviruses do not kill in the rampant fashion of HIV. Theycause immune disruption and lead to a vast array of diseases, including cancer.That is the challenge of this struggle. We need to stop the viruses that aredisabling our population, robbing people of the quality of their lives and, onlyafter years of torture, mercifully ending their existence.We were interested in the pattern of disease among the families of those withME/CFS. If XMRV was a virus that behaved similarly to HIV, it would tend to getpassed down from mother to child. Early in our research we’d noted severalchildren with autism born to the affected mothers and tested seventeen of thesechildren for XMRV. Was autism nothing more than ME/CFS in the young, when theirdevelopment requires massive amounts of energy to develop the neurologicalconnections necessary for speech, social interaction, and organized thinking?Fourteen of the seventeen children with autism tested positive for evidence ofXMRV.The findings dovetailed with parental reports of autistic regression after avaccination, and we felt it should be publicly discussed, especially with thelessons learned from Ryan White, a child who contracted HIV from a bloodtransfusion. At the time, we had not considered the possibility that XMRV mighthave originally come from animal tissue used in the vaccines.But the simple act of providing support to the autism community and theirconcerns about vaccinations was akin to treason for many of my scientificcolleagues. Honestly, we tried to downplay that implication of our research.But we weren’t going to hide from it. Frank and I had seen firsthand the carnagethat resulted from the dogma surrounding HIV-AIDS. We were not going to let theband play merrily along again while millions suffered and died.That’s never been our style, and it’s decidedly not good science.image [../Images/common.jpg]An article in the journal Frontiers in Microbiology published in January of 2011placed the issue in stark terms:One of the most widely distributed biological products that frequently involvedmice or mouse tissue, at least up to recent years, are vaccines, especiallyvaccines against viruses . . . It is possible that XMRV particles were presentin virus stocks cultured in mice or mouse cells for vaccine production, and thatthe virus was transferred to the human population by vaccination.10[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn101_10]Does it make sense now why we weren’t the most popular folks in the scientificcommunity? Was it possible that scientists in the lab had made terrible mistakesdecades earlier, putting the health of humanity at risk? Our research seemed tosuggest that possibility.When it became clear that our research was opening old wounds and the asking ofinconvenient questions, a campaign of unprecedented ferocity was launchedagainst us. Most of that story is covered in our previous book, PLAGUE. By theend of 2012, our work had been thoroughly discredited in the scientificcommunity. I’d been arrested and jailed for five days and rendered unemployableby the fraudulent acts of those at the highest levels of Health and HumanServices (HHS).If you read the Wikipedia version of my life, you will find that our work hasbeen discredited, that what we believed to be an infection was simply labcontamination, and for good measure you might also find the mug shot of me thatwas published in the journal Science when I was arrested, but curiously, notcharged for supposedly “stealing” my own research journals, a requirement as theprincipal investigator on two large government grants and required by federallaw. The principal investigator on a government grant is responsible for thesecurity of all materials on the project. As of this date, more than seven yearslater, I have not been provided copies of a single page of my notebooks or thoseof my research team.If I am a criminal, why were no charges ever brought against me? My record isclean. And in the years since my false arrest and imprisonment, why have I beenunable to have a single day in court for a judge and jury to hear my claims,even though I have never given up the effort to receive process?image [../Images/common.jpg]In September of 2013, Dr. Ian Lipkin, the man who the previous year hadsupposedly debunked our findings of a retroviral connection to ME/CFS, held anunusual public conference call. He had done further research with Dr. JoseMontoya of Stanford University. Using a cohort of patients very similar to theone we used for the Science paper (and the very cohort excluded from the 2012study by Tony Fauci, head of the National Institute for Allergy and InfectiousDiseases), Lipkin said:We found retroviruses in 85 percent of the sample pools. Again, it is verydifficult at this point to know whether or not this is clinically significant.And given the previous experience with retroviruses in chronic fatigue, I amgoing to be very clear in telling you, although I am reporting this as presentin Professor Montoya’s samples, neither he nor we have concluded that there is arelationship to disease.11 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn101_11]Got it? Even though he found retroviruses in 85 percent of the samples of thesick patients, and in only 6 percent of the controls, he can’t figure out if itmeans anything. And more shockingly, they’re not going to do any furtherinvestigation.This is the nightmare of censored and “dangerous” science today. There are nodata because the appropriate studies are forbidden and censored.image [../Images/common.jpg]Before I get too far into this story, I need to spend a little time talkingabout my longtime colleague, Frank Ruscetti. Everything I am as a scientist Iowe to him.I often compare our two personalities to Thomas Jefferson and AlexanderHamilton. These two men have often been likened to the twin strands of DNA forthe American character. Jefferson believed in a decentralized government toguarantee liberty, while Hamilton believed in a strong central government toprevent chaos. Jefferson didn’t care about criticism. Hamilton had ahair-trigger temper regarding criticism, which explains why he died in a duel todefend his honor with Aaron Burr, Jefferson’s vice-president, in 1804.I find myself identifying more with Jefferson, seeing the need for multiplecenters of inquiry, loving vigorous debate, and not caring if somebodycriticizes me or my ideas. Frank is more like Hamilton, believing science needsto speak with a unified voice, and bristling with indignation if he feels he’sbeen unfairly criticized.Maybe it’s because I’m a woman who feels she’s always been dismissed by the goodol’ boys of science, but most of them don’t impress me very much. For example,Frank will care about what John Coffin thinks about him, even though Frank’sbeen proving Coffin wrong for nearly forty years, in things as important aswhether human retroviruses exist. (Hello, HIV-AIDS, killer of more thanthirty-five million people!) I look at John Coffin and see an arrogantmisogynist.Even though Jefferson and Hamilton were often on different sides of an issue,Jefferson respected Hamilton. At Monticello, Jefferson placed busts of himselfand Hamilton staring at each other, as if realizing their two points of viewwould constitute the essential dialogue of this new country for centuries tocome. Jefferson would later speak of Hamilton as a “singular character” who waspossessed of “acute understanding” and was “disinterested, honest, andhonorable.” I could say all of this about Frank and more.It’s probably not a surprise that Hamilton is Frank’s favorite musical and he’sfond of quoting the lyrics, “Who lives? Who dies? Who tells your story?”As I’ve said, I’m more of a Jeffersonian, and it’s not simply because I did myundergraduate work at the University of Virginia, founded by Jefferson. Thethree accomplishments Jefferson wanted to be remembered for and listed on histombstone were: “Author of the Declaration of American Independence, Of theStatute of Virginia for religious freedom & Father of the University ofVirginia.” Independence, freedom, and the pursuit of knowledge. That about sumsme up.I think it’s probably accurate to call me more of a revolutionary and Frank moreof a conservative. But the reality is more complex than those labels. I may be arevolutionary, but I understand the need for stability. And while Frank may bemore conservative, he understands the need for change. We may often start fromdifferent perspectives, but after a good debate, we can usually settle on areasonable course of action.But in this current dark age of science, both the revolutionary and theconservative are exiled. The revolutionary is shouted down for their new ideas,and when the conservative asks for the evidence to support an existing policy,they’re told the issue has already been settled. Stop with the questions! Inplace of the revolutionaries and conservatives in science, we now have theliars, the mercenaries, and the cowards.Science can weather honest disagreements between researchers of integrity andintelligence, but it cannot survive this current plague of corruption.image [../Images/common.jpg]None of my former colleagues call to ask me to join in their research. Nocollege or university will offer me a teaching position. Instead, I’m blessed towork and often bicker about these issues with my longtime collaborator, Frank,in a small consulting practice, doing what we’ve done for the past thirty-fiveyears, namely, trying to understand the process of disease, and how to end theneedless suffering of so many.In Bernard Malamud’s classic baseball novel, The Natural, the hero is told, “Wehave two lives, Roy, the life we learn with and the life we live after that.”One might say the life I learned with is the story Kent and I told in PLAGUE.This book you are now reading is about the life I lived after that, when wediscovered corruption in many areas of science was widespread but realized therewas also great reason for hope.What seems like an ending is almost always a new beginning in some way.I entered professional science on June 10, 1980, as a protein chemist workingfor the National Cancer Institute to purify Interferon, at the time arevolutionary cancer treatment. My eventual mentor at the National CancerInstitute, Frank, had been part of the team that discovered the first humanretrovirus, HTLV-1 (human T-cell leukemia virus). We were well poised to fightthe HIV-AIDS epidemic, which was looming in the future. I remember working atthe National Cancer Institute in the mid-1980s and walking through crowds ofangry AIDS activists who were shouting we weren’t doing enough to cure theirdisease.In 1991, when I defended my doctoral thesis, it was about how HIV hides from theimmune system like a Trojan horse and how targeting drugs to this Trojan horsecould turn this fatal disease into a manageable one. One week before my doctoraldefense, the professional basketball player Magic Johnson tested positive forthe HIV virus.I was asked by my thesis committee members whether Magic Johnson would die ofAIDS. My lengthy molecular biology response was simply that not only would henot die of AIDS, he would never develop AIDS, given that his infection wasrecently acquired, and the new drugs would silence the activity of the virus inorder to avoid damage to his immune system. This was totally against the dogmaof the time that these drugs were too dangerous and should only be given in thelater stages of the disease. By that time, I argued, Magic would have no immunesystem with which to respond to the drugs.More than twenty-five years later, Magic has not developed AIDS and lives well.As have millions of others who would have otherwise died. And we are doing evenmore. We have learned not only how to silence the virus but are discovering howto flush it out of its hiding places and eradicate it, so there can be an actualcure.In an optimal setting, that’s what science does.It tells the truth and finds answers.Even when that truth is a dark one, we must find a way to bring it into thelight.I’ve been asked why I’m writing this book. After all, hasn’t my tale alreadybeen told? Our work was celebrated for a moment, then I was eliminated. End ofstory.But just because science isn’t paying attention to Frank and I doesn’t mean wehaven’t been paying attention to the science. We understand so much better theinflammatory storm raging in the bodies of millions and how we might use thingslike cannabis, suramin, energy therapies, diet, and other natural products toquell this tempest.We can put the ghosts of the past to rest and move forward into an unimaginablybright future of health for all."},{"pageContent":"images [../Images/line.jpg]CHAPTER ONEA Scientist at Seaimages [../Images/line.jpg]It was late October of 2011, halfway between getting fired from the neuroimmuneinstitute I cofounded and finding myself in jail, when I was riding my bike downHarbor Boulevard through the sand dunes of McGrath State Park in Oxnard,California.Think of every fantasy you have of Southern California—the blue Pacific Oceanwith whitecaps, a late fall breeze, the beach, parks where parents with theirchildren were flying kites—and you have a pretty good picture of why I liked totake this route. That day I was biking from our boat-dock home located on asmall canal to the PBYC where I was part of a group planning an annual sailingcompetition to benefit Caregivers, an organization that helps the elderly remainin their homes.And what did I look like as I rode through some of the less-traveled areas nearMcGrath State Park? I was in my midfifties, stood five foot four, weighed aroundone hundred and forty pounds. I imagined I was probably indistinguishable from agreat number of people as I pedaled along on my blue bike wearing an orangehelmet and bright biking clothes.Although I’d recently lost my job and was in the middle of a heated scientificcontroversy, I wasn’t unduly worried. I was the principal investigator onfederal grants worth approximately 1.5 to 2 million dollars a year for anyuniversity that hired me. I had interviews lined up at the University ofCalifornia, Los Angeles (UCLA), the University of California, Santa Barbara,California State University, Channel Islands, as well as an opportunity in NewYork City at Mount Sinai Medical Center with Dr. Derek Enlander. We owned threehomes, several cars, and a boat, had money in the bank, and my husband had agenerous pension from the years he worked as the human resources manager for amajor hospital.The research institute I’d cofounded was housed at the University of Nevada,Reno. The man who’d hired me, Harvey Whittemore, was generally considered themost powerful person in the state. He would eventually spend eighteen months infederal prison for campaign finance violations involving Senator Harry Reid, atthat time the majority leader of the United States Senate. These people who hadonce been my close friends had betrayed me and millions of others. I had refusedtheir directive to be part of what I considered to be unethical and illegalactions. And I had not gone quietly into that good night. I had raged againstthe dying light of hope that had been so briefly kindled by our work, on behalfof a forgotten group of terribly sick people.A white pickup truck with Nevada plates pulled ahead of me, parking in the bikelane. As I pedaled by the parked vehicle, I saw the driver holding up his cellphone, as if he were taking pictures of me. He was a large man with a beard,brown hair underneath a baseball cap, sunglasses, a tan, and he gave off anunmistakably creepy vibe. I couldn’t help but notice he had a rifle mounted inhis back window. This dance of following behind me, pulling ahead and parking tolet me pass, then pulling out again happened several times before I crossed thestreet and rode opposite traffic and he drove off.When I made it to the yacht club, I told the story to a friend. “It was reallypretty strange,” I said. “He just kept following me.”“You fool,” said my friend. “You could disappear. All he has to do is make sureit’s you, grab you, throw your bike in the dunes, throw your cell phone in thewater, then when they find your body someday, people will say you killedyourself because things weren’t working out in the XMRV study. So help me, God,if you ever ride that bike again, I will personally kill you. I’m driving youhome. And from now on, you are never in a place alone where people like that canfind you.”She was adamant, and I complied, realizing that one of my blind spots is notbeing able to see when people intend me harm. I was often referred to as a “labrat,” the designation given to those scientists who prefer to spend their timeat the bench doing experiments rather than glad-handing politicians and donorsor haranguing graduate students on the work for which the senior scientist willtake credit. I preferred to be in the lab, hands-on, shoulder to shoulder withFrank, research assistants, and students, guiding them and challenging them, asthey do the same, making sure the explanations I gave them and the conclusionswe made were sound.This is where I have spent most of my professional life with Frank, challengingthe reigning dogma when the lens of a microscope tells a different story.However, I was about to get an education in the dark arts of humanity, thelandscape of fear and lies. I did not fully appreciate the power of those whowield these skills. I am not sure I have found my way back to the light.I think more of us are under this spell than we realize.image [../Images/common.jpg]How do you commit the perfect crime in science?We’re handicapped from the start because it’s a question we never ask. For morethan thirty years, Frank taught me and many others to record our dataaccurately, compare them with collaborators around the world, discard theoutliers, and come to a consensus. We understand there are variations, but ifthe bulk of the evidence goes in a certain direction, we are confident we have abetter understanding of human biological processes.If only that were what happened in the real world.In the real world there are corporations, be they pharmaceutical, agricultural,petroleum, or chemical companies, that have billions of dollars at stake in thework of scientists. If one has billions of dollars, he can use the dark arts ofpersuasion to hire public relations firms to tout your products, sow the seedsof doubt about those who question your products, buy advertising on newsnetworks so they don’t publicize negative stories unless they have no otherchoice, and donate to politicians of all ideologies. Then, once thosepoliticians have been elected, they can write laws for the benefit of theirgenerous donors. As it was put so eloquently in the seventeenth century by aprominent member of Queen Elizabeth’s court, “If it prospers, none dare call ittreason.”Against this financial and corporate juggernaut is the naive and inquisitivescientist. We are not taught to be fierce. We take no graduate courses incourage. We are encouraged to believe the raw data as long as all theexperimental controls are used, and we report ALL of the data, even if we do notunderstand them.I’ve often thought we in science would do well to follow the example of lawyers.In my conversations with attorneys, it’s clear they relish intellectual combat.They will stand and defend the most hated individual in society, because theybelieve that person is genuinely innocent, or that a certain process must befollowed before we can pronounce judgment. Frank taught me a love of suchintellectual combat. In Frank’s eyes, if you’d followed the scientific method,you had a duty to fiercely defend those data. And with Frank, you checked,rechecked, and triple-checked your data before he’d let you show them.Once a colleague told us, “the most important data in a scientific paper isthose data you don’t show.” That statement enraged Frank. He’d often say, “thebest papers leave the readers asking more questions than they answer.” We leftin all the data in our October 8, 2009, Science paper, even those parts we didnot understand at the time. Even though that paper ended my career, it speaksthe truth to this day.Those in the legal profession are taught to be fierce. I am thankful that Franktaught me to be as fierce as any lawyer.The best scientists in history have been those who have similarly gone againstthe grain of traditional thought. Think of Galileo claiming the Sun did notrevolve around the Earth, or Darwin challenging the Biblical idea that allcreation, plants and animals, land and sea, were created in six days, and Godrested on the seventh.One day, as I was whining about the negative papers being published supposedlyrefuting the XMRV association with ME/CFS, Frank took me into his office andpointed to a file cabinet in the corner. He opened the drawers containingpublished papers saying he was wrong about T-cell growth factor (interleukin-2),or HTLV-1, causing Adult T-Cell Leukemia. One paper was published that verymonth! He said, “If you can’t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen. Now, let’sget back to work.”I encourage you to consider the scientific questions raised in this book thesame way you would follow one of the high-profile criminal cases that from timeto time consume so much of our national attention. You understand a claim willbe made. This person is accused of killing another person. You will hear theevidence presented, watch it be challenged by the other side, then come to yourown determination as to which pieces of evidence are credible and which are not.It is a methodical process. After each side has introduced their evidence anddealt with the challenges to its credibility by the opposing side, you arrive atyour conclusion.Let me make the claim that underlies everything that follows.Science is being corrupted by the influence of corporate money. This corruptionis leading directly to our poor health, whether it be the epidemic of obesity;neurological diseases like autism, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and multiplesclerosis; the explosion of cancers; or mental problems among the young,including school shooters. There are some who claim this is leading to aculling, if not the mass extinction, of humanity.Based upon all we have experienced, I find it difficult to counter thistroubling narrative.I entered all of this as naive as a first-year graduate student.I did not believe science to be as fundamentally corrupt regarding our health asI have now come to believe. I want you to consider me as the young boy in HansChristian Anderson’s tale, The Emperor’s New Clothes. In the story, the Emperoris told by the crooks that they were creating a set of clothes for him thatcould be seen by only the finest people. All the people around the Emperorclaimed they saw the beautiful clothes because they wanted everybody to believethey were the finest people. Only a young boy, unconcerned by what othersthought of him, pointed out that the Emperor was naked.If you are continuing to read this book, you are effectively impaneled as thejury on a claim that science has chosen a misguided path. You’ve taken animplicit pledge to listen to what we and others say with an open mind. We didnot come to our conclusions easily.I do not expect you to, either.But let us begin this journey together.I did not know if I could write this book. Many of the incidents are sotroubling to recount that I worry about suffering from post-traumatic stressdisorder, the condition so often found in soldiers, police, or firefighters, whoserve on the very front lines of conflict. This is the story of a battle beingfought by a few brave scientists against an enemy with almost limitlessresources.Science may be agnostic in this struggle, but I am not.I’m a person of faith and believe God wants humanity to enjoy good health, notsuffer.Sometimes people ask me how I’m still alive, and I reply, “God has a sense ofhumor.” I do not know my ultimate fate or how I will be judged by this world. Itdoesn’t matter.However, I know one day I will stand before God, who will ask if I was obedientand served as He requires. What I share in the pages that follow is the accountI would give the Almighty on Judgment Day.image [../Images/common.jpg]The pounding on the door of our boat-dock home located on Jamestown Way inOxnard began at about 5:00 a.m. on November 9, 2011.I was in the shower, and my husband, David, waking and finding me not next tohim, figured I was already on my way to work, as I was most mornings. I like toget an early start.Always have. Even though David wears hearing aids, he does not wear them atnight, and he stumbled out of bed to walk downstairs, not realizing I was in thebathroom.A man was at the door, wearing a badge and claiming he had a legal document toserve to Judy Mikovits.“She’s not here,” David replied, wearily, wearing only his boxers and a t-shirt.“She’s long gone. She’ll be back here at about eight o’clock. You’re welcome tocome back tomorrow or wait.”The man declined the offer to return and waited out in front of his car.That morning I was supposed to have a meeting at UCLA, accompanied by my goodfriend, Ken, with whom I had previously worked at EpiGenX Pharmaceuticals inSanta Barbara. UCLA was sixty miles away, and that distance in Los Angeles rushhour traffic is not a treat. There was also the possibility that Ken and I wouldmeet up later in the day with Patrick Soon-Shiong, the Chinese billionaire whowould eventually purchase the Los Angeles Times, to discuss a potential jobworking for one of his companies. Prior to amassing great wealth, Soon-Shionghad been a transplant surgeon and founded a successful biotechnology company.Ken thought the three of us would speak a similar language.David walked up the stairs as I came out of the bathroom, just about ready toleave. I asked, “What was that about?”David nearly jumped out of his skin. I’d like to say these things happen becausemy husband is twenty years older than I, but I’ve known enough couples torealize this is a relatively common experience for many.After he calmed down, he explained to me what had happened.“That’s odd,” I said, recalling I’d been threatened with a lawsuit by my formeremployers on November 2. The letter had given me only forty-eight hours torespond, and I’d complied, using my friend Lois, an attorney who suffers fromME/CFS. We’d faxed the reply on November 4 from my friend Lilly’s house, wellwithin the deadline.After the incident with the creepy man in the white pickup truck with Nevadaplates, I started to become suspicious of other events. Our boat-dock home wasan end unit in a row with other houses. Just across from us was a smallgreenbelt and next to it, another end-unit home that had been unoccupied for along time. In October, it was suddenly occupied, and the new residents installedbright lights that appeared to be focused on our house. Residents often put suchlights on their houses to illuminate the water of the harbor, but these seemedoddly angled. I’ve always enjoyed natural sunlight, so I don’t have any shadesor curtains on my windows, so it was as if I were living under a spotlight.Mike Hugo, my attorney, was later able to get through discovery an admissionthat during this time I was under surveillance by police from Nevada andCalifornia and local law enforcement.I quickly gave a call to Ken, telling him what had happened and explaining Iprobably couldn’t make the interview with UCLA that day.Ken was immediately on high alert. If anybody understood the high stakes ofwhere my research was leading, it was Ken. He was a money guy who knew ourdiscovery was worth billions, and it was clear to him what this cover-up wasabout. The intellectual property! Not only had we discovered a new retrovirusfamily, but our colleagues were saying it had probably been spread through thepopulation via vaccinations and had likely infected more than ten millionAmericans.Could I be in any more trouble?“Get rid of your cell phone,” he said. “Take the battery out of it and throw itin the water. Do not use that phone again. They can track you with it.”Neither Ken nor I was a secret agent. I was a scientist, and he was a money guywith a background in public health.“Okay,” I answered.“I’ll make an excuse for you. But you need to get out now.”We talked for a few more seconds, then I quickly hung up and took the batteryout of the phone.My mind immediately flashed to a padded 5 x 7 manila envelope that a ME/CFSpatient and autism mother from one of the family studies had sent me in thesummer of 2011.We’d been focused on the possible connection between ME/CFS and autism, but thetruth is our work was casting a much broader net.Infection by a retrovirus can cause a myriad of diseases, depending upon eachperson’s unique genetic vulnerabilities.The bulk of my twenty years spent in government science had been at the NationalCancer Institute. It was a pattern of unusual cancers among long-term sufferersof ME/CFS that first caused me to become interested in the condition. As withHIV-AIDS, mothers with XMRV could pass the virus directly to their children.Transmission to the spouses, although possible, was less likely.In the padded 5 x 7 manila envelope, the mother had sent me several onehundred-dollar bills, a portable camping potty, a fake pen with a recordingdevice and camera, a go-phone with minutes on a card, and a note that read, “Youreally don’t understand, but you’re going to need these.”At the time I’d received it, I’d fretted with David about it. “We have plenty ofmoney in the bank. Why do I need ten one hundred-dollar bills? We must send backthis money to that sweet mom.” I’d called up the mother and offered to send itback, but she refused. My husband often needs to use the bathroom on long trips,so I thought I’d at least keep the portable camping potty. Practical Judy.I put the card in the go-phone, got it working, then called Frank, who I knewwould be at his desk in Frederick, MD, early in the morning. Before he wasforced to retire in 2013, Frank would spend a total of thirty-nine years at theNational Cancer Institute. I quickly explained what had taken place and askedhis advice.“You dummy,” he said. “You’ve got a boat and you live on the water. They can’ttake somebody off the water. You can escape from your house.”It was a great idea, and I quickly put a plan into action.My stepdaughter, Elizabeth, was staying in our second bedroom at the time.Depending on the time of year, she’s either six or seven years younger than I,and we have a similar build and hair color. It was her birthday, and we wereplanning to take her to lunch that day. David went into her room and roused herand asked her to come downstairs.I laid out the plan to David and Elizabeth. “The two of you will leave the houseand go for a walk in the neighborhood. Let’s figure out what’s going on.”“I don’t want to go for a walk!” David complained.“I don’t want to go, either,” Elizabeth joined in.“Look, it’s going to be fine. They’re just trying to serve me with something.Let’s figure out what’s going on.”The two of them got ready and left the house. After getting a short distanceaway, three men approached them, and one of them was the same who had knocked onour door. “Judy Mikovits, we are serving you with a lawsuit,” he said, producinga piece of paper.“I’m not Judy Mikovits,” said Elizabeth, pulling out her driver’s license andshowing it to them. “He’s my daddy and it’s my birthday,” she said with a laugh,throwing them off their game. After briefly examining her driver’s license, theylet them go.When they returned to the house, it was clear to me that I was surrounded. Thewater was the only way out. “Elizabeth, I want you to go out on the deck. Letthem see you. David, I want you to get the Baby Jonah ready for a boat ride.”“I don’t want to go for a boat ride!” David protested.“You’re going to take your daughter for a boat ride because it’s her birthdayand we promised to take her for lunch.” He complied, and I waited inside, takingcare to stay away from any of the windows where I could be observed. I wentupstairs and packed a backpack. By this time, it was about eleven in themorning. (Noon would be low tide.)When David came back saying the boat was ready, I asked him what Elizabeth waswearing.“I don’t know,” he replied.This was killing me. In light of what I’d experienced over the past few weeks,I’d imagined the situation would be clearer to them.David left and returned, saying she was wearing black yoga pants and a darkt-shirt. I found some clothes that approximately matched those, along with adark blue t-shirt given to me by one of the patients that read, “CSI: Can’tStand Idiots.” Nothing like a little humor when you’re surrounded, right?I had two identical baseball caps bearing the sail number of my friend’s boatand gave one to David for Elizabeth to wear, since it was windy that day.“Here’s what I want you to do. Give her the cap, go to the boat for a fewminutes, and start the engine. Call out to Elizabeth that you want to take herto lunch. She’ll say it’s cold and she doesn’t want to go. You just tell her togo in and get a jacket and come back. That’s when we’ll make the switch.”David seemed to get the idea, though he thought it silly. Within five minutes,all of this had taken place and Elizabeth walked into the house. I looked atwhat she was wearing, the jacket I’d put on, and we were a close match. I waitedfor a few moments, then, clutching the backpack, walked out the back door to thedock. I jumped on the boat, David cast off the line, and we started moving downthe channel, hugging the left seawall.When we got to the main channel, David floored the accelerator. He loved to gofast on that thirteen-foot Boston Whaler. He looked at me and, in the fakeRussian accent he often likes to adopt, said, “Katarina, vee have escaped! Butvee don’t know where to go. What shall vee do?”“I’ve got an idea.”I called my dear friend Robin, who owns a thirty-eight-foot sailboat docked inthe Channel Islands Harbor. The boat sleeps five people and David and I had beensailing on it often with Robin and her husband, Steve. I told her we had anissue and asked if I could stay on it for a few days. She said sure, and I thenasked if she could bring some food.“And one other thing. Is there vodka on board?”“There’s always vodka on board,” she replied.Even though it was still morning, I knew I’d have a tough time sleeping thatnight.David knew the route to the Channel Islands Harbor (located on the coast ofCalifornia) and Robin’s boat. Within about fifteen minutes, he’d pulled up toher boat. I gave him a few of the hundred-dollar bills from my envelope so hewouldn’t need to use a credit card. At this time, I figured I was simply dealingwith some Harvey Whittemore goons from the University of Nevada, Reno, and acouple local rent-a-cops determined to intimidate me. We simply needed to findan attorney who could practice in both California and Nevada. Then I would besafe. I told David he needed to avoid Robin’s boat until he had found anattorney.After getting onto the boat, I headed down into one of the cabins and pulled outmy go-phone. I called ME/CFS patient and friend, Jeanette. She and her husband,Ed, are both attorneys in San Francisco. After I explained what had transpired,she said she’d start looking for a local attorney who could handle my case.When I finished my call with Jeannette, I paused for a moment to catch mybreath. It was a very windy day, the rigging on the mast was clanging, the boatwas slowly rocking, and I was completely terrified. This is not how a PhDscientist, with more than fifty peer-reviewed publications to her name, expectsto find herself, especially when she recently led the team that produced aground-breaking publication in the world’s most prestigious journal of originalresearch.Fighting down my rising sense of panic, I called Frank to let him know I wassafe. He was happy to hear the news but had another pressing issue on his mind.The journal Science had called and was pressing him to retract our entirearticle published in October 2009, which showed isolation of a new family ofhuman retroviruses and an association with ME/CFS. We had known this fight wascoming, for many of the reasons I have previously mentioned.If our data were allowed to stand, the inevitable result would be a massivefinancial catastrophe for the world’s pharmaceutical companies because of theirnegligent use of animal cell cultures to produce vaccines and otherpharmaceutical products. As any criminal lawyer will tell you, the fight isalways about motive and opportunity.I have just given you the motive.Let me tell you about the unique opportunity created by XMRV.In March of 2006, Dr. Robert Silverman of the highly regarded Cleveland Clinicand his team published detection of nucleic acid sequences related to murineleukemia viruses in samples of tissues from men who had prostate cancer. Theynamed the virus XMRV. The idea that viruses may predispose to cancer has beenwidely upheld and is one of the most active areas of research in medicine.There was only one problem with Silverman’s report of a new human retroviruscausing aggressive prostate cancer. They never isolated the virus and showed itto be infectious and transmissible. They had only detected a few hundredbase-pairs of XMRV, and from that they cloned the remaining eight thousand basepairs in the laboratory using only those few hundred base pairs of the DNA theyobtained from the biopsies.Because the tissue biopsies contained only a tiny amount of DNA, Silverman andhis colleagues had to piece together the virus from several biopsies fromdifferent patients in order to get enough DNA to put together a completesequence and generate an infectious molecular clone.An additional level of complexity is what we consider genetic stability.For example, between humans and chimpanzees, there is a 99 percent similarity ingenes, but they are dramatically different creatures. However, the reversetranscriptase enzyme of retroviruses is error-prone. This causes wide geneticdifference in the virus.Retroviruses with up to 10 percent variance in their genetic codes will still beclassified in the same retrovirus family, perhaps simply a different strain orclade, just as with the HIV or HTLV families of viruses.What Silverman’s colleagues did was to take DNA from three different patientbiopsies and splice them together in a Frankenstein fashion to create aninfectious molecular clone that he referred to as XMRV. In fact, we were thefirst to isolate the natural XMRV from humans, as we reported in Science.Silverman’s stitched-together Frankenstein monster clone XMRV, which had neverexisted in nature, was given the designation VP62.Silverman did not tell us he created that infectious molecular clone from threedifferent biopsies until June of 2011. He only admitted his mea culpa to Frankwhen the inescapable conclusion of all the data we did not understand, butstaunchly refused to take out of the Science paper, eventually revealed hisdeceit.I consider Silverman’s failure to tell the world what he did in 2006 a crime ofthe greatest magnitude and should have resulted in his being driven out ofscience.It was not a mistake.He concealed a material fact.VP62 had dramatically different sequence and growth characteristics than ournaturally occurring XMRV isolates, which we obtained from ME/CFS patients,cancer patients, and children with autism. The deceit was clear, as the serologytest for VP62 developed by Abbott, which funded millions to the Silverman lab,never detected a single positive. Yet, the serology test we published in Sciencedetected most of the variant strains.Another example was that VP62 replicated at a rate at least twenty-five timesfaster than natural isolates of XMRV, many of which were defective, as with mostretroviruses, including HIV. That meant that if VP62 was anywhere near arepresentative of a natural XMRV infection, it would soon overrun it like aninvasive species.In 2011, we discovered that both VP62 and XMRV had the capacity to becomeaerosolized, meaning they could simply drift through the air, going wherever theslightest breeze might blow them. The guardians of corrupt science realized theyhad unleashed VP62 like an assassin and it could destroy evidence of naturalXMRV if the two samples were housed in the same facility.My greatest concern was that well-meaning efforts to create weakened viruses forvaccines had created new problems. Had science properly considered the questionof whether any mixing of human and animal tissue brought with it the inevitablerisk of transferring animal viruses to humans? Or that these animal viruseswould combine with human viruses to create new pathogens?Frank was keenly aware of that simple fact, as through the summer of 2011 we hadbeen working feverishly going over our samples to show they contained XMRVs andnot Silverman’s VP62 molecular clone. We proved that repeatedly. I’d had ascientific debate with staunch supporter turned fiercest critic, John Coffin, onSeptember 22, 2011, in Ottawa, Canada, on the issue and had come away the clearvictor. In my conclusion, I asked him, “How many XMRVs have we created, John?How many?” This debate in a session of the IACFS biannual meeting was supposedto be about whether the scientific community had a diagnostic screening test forXMRV in the blood supply. Why had Science rushed this fraudulent paper thattargeted the patient community? It was NOT an association study. There were onlyfifteen patients. And besides, how can you have an association study with aFrankenstein virus constructed in a lab that had nothing to do with the naturalstrain of XMRVs we isolated?If these fears were true, was science standing up and admitting the mistake? Myworry was that researchers like Coffin didn’t want to rock the boat. They didn’twant to be the ones to stand up and say science had made a terrible mistake andpossibly injured millions of people.This injustice surely could not be allowed to stand.Who was I, a middle-aged female scientist at an upstart institute out of Nevada,to tell the old boys network of science that they and their predecessors hadmade a terrible mistake?And I was demanding it had to be stopped. I refused to retract the paper, forthe data proved all I had said, and to this day it remains right and true.By Sunday, November 13, David found an attorney, and I felt safe enough to comeout of hiding, return to my home, and go to church services that afternoon.The following Friday afternoon as we returned from a beach walk, three policecars descended on my house. I was arrested, taken away to jail, and held withoutbail for five days. The police searched my house from top to bottom, leavingpapers strewn everywhere, claiming I had taken notebooks that were obligation toretain as the principal investigator on two government grants.They did not find the notebooks during that search.That same day, police raided the home of my friend Lilly and forced her to sitin a chair for several hours while they conducted a search of her house. Theonly explanation I have for this action is that I faxed my response to theircivil claim from her house. No notebooks were found. They were not there. Neverwere. I left them in my office the day of September 29, 2011. I believe theWhittemores knew it and fabricated the events of that day in order to covertheir crimes. The crimes as detailed in my scientific debate with John Coffinwere memorialized in an article published by Science on September 30, 2011, theday after I was fired. The article, written by Jon Cohen, ended with “she hopesto have full sequences of her new viruses in a couple of weeks.”1[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn1_1] That was why I needed to be fired, and when Iwouldn’t stop my investigations, they carried out the threat to destroy mycareer.During my time in jail, the people who engineered my arrest and harassment, thepowerful Whittemore family of Nevada, had David running all over the placetrying to release the hold on my bail. Despite a thorough police search of myresidence, the notebooks in question suddenly appeared at my house on Mondayevening, placed in a bag from my residence in Reno when I was fired in lateSeptember of 2011. Now I think I fully appreciate the desperation of my formeremployers, the Whittemores. Fire me on the 29th. Immediately lock down my laband two offices. I had shown Harvey Whittemore what I believed to be theaccurate sequences of XMRV in late August of 2011. Frank had that information,as well. Preventing me from accessing my notebooks, as has been done since I wasfired, keeps me from having the information I need to defend myself.There are only two possibilities.The first possibility is I’m lying, and the police were incompetent when theysearched my house during my arrest.The second is I’m telling the truth.Here are some facts I want you to consider.Charges were never brought against me in any court nor was any trial ever held.I’m not like one of those mobsters who say they’ve never been convicted, butthey’ve sat through several trials where government lawyers did their best toconvict the defendant. In fact, no prosecutor ever looked at the facts of thecase at all. David was called by Harvey Whittemore and told if I did not findthe notebooks I would remain in that jail throughout the Thanksgiving holiday.When David found them neatly packed in that linen beach bag and frantically tookthem to the jail well after midnight, no one had any idea what he was talkingabout. They sent him back to the arresting officers.This is how the chain of events were described in the False Claims/RICO law suitI filed against Harvey Whittemore and others on July 27, 2015 (originally onNovember 17, 2014):On November 21, 2011, the plaintiff’s husband received a phone call from arepresentative of HW [Harvey Whittemore], AW [Annette Whittemore], Kinne [CarliWest Kinne], Lombardi [Vince Lombardi] and Hillerby [Mike Hillerby], to discussthe fact that plaintiff would likely remain in jail through the Thanksgivingholiday, which was in two days, unless he returned the notebooks.Having nearly completed the entire task of reorganizing all the materials,clothing, books, papers, and other possessions that had been strewn about thehouse by the UNRPD [University of Reno, Police Department] officers in thewarrantless and illegal search, the plaintiff’s husband assured therepresentative of HW, AW, Kinne, Lombardi, and Hillerby, that he had beenthrough the entire house and that the notebooks were not there. He assured therepresentative that if the plaintiff had the notebooks, neither she nor he wereaware of it, and that they were not in the house.At that time, the representative of HW, AW, Kinne, Lombardi, and Hillerby toldthe plaintiff’s husband, “David, listen very closely to me. You DO have them. Iam telling you. Now go and find them and return them to get Judy out of jail.The men hung up the phone and the plaintiff’s husband sat in complete perplexityat the entire conversation, knowing he had scoured the entire house as hereplaced items in drawers, closets, shelves and table tops.The following morning, the plaintiff’s husband awoke and reinitiated his search,looking for places that the plaintiff may have secreted the notebooks, all thewhile replaying the conversation with the representative of HW, AW, Kinne,Lombardi, and Hillerby, in his mind.As the plaintiff’s husband began to look through cabinets, book shelves anddrawers for the notebooks that the representative of HW, AW, Lombardi andHillerby insisted were in the house, he came up empty. Repeatedly doubting hissanity as he continued the same search that he and the police had eachpreviously conducted, somehow expecting or hoping for a different outcome, hewas rapidly becoming disheartened as he began to dread— Thanksgiving—which heknew would be the loneliest day of his life.While searching through one of the guest room closets, the plaintiff’s husbanddiscovered a canvas beach bag with JAM embroidered on the side, that he had notseen previously, and that was not inventoried as part of the search. Even moresuspicious was the fact that the bag was sitting in the front and center of thecloset as if it were the last item placed therein. Inside the bag were theplaintiff’s notebooks.The notebooks were planted in the closet by the representative of HW, AW, Kinne,Lombardi and Hillerby, or by other agents of HW, AW, Lombardi and Hillerby.2[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn1_2]I did not have those notebooks, and I did not have that canvas beach bag. Thosenotebooks were secured on September 29, 2011, by my research associate, MaxPfost, who suspected the Whittemores would try to sell a non-validated test andthat canvas beach bag was in my place in Reno, Nevada. I believe Max was forcedto give those notebooks to Harvey Whittemore, who then decided to use them in anattempt to frame me by claiming I’d stolen them and planting them in my housewhile I was in jail and my husband was racing all over the place trying to finda lawyer. Harvey or somebody associated with him must have gone into my place inReno and taken that bag so they could put the notebooks inside and plant them inthat closet.I appeared before the Ventura County judge late Tuesday afternoon, when JonCohen of Science was waiting, petitioning the court for a picture of me in myorange jumpsuit with my hands and feet shackled. Thankfully, the judge refused.But that would not deter Jon Cohen from sending the message to all scientists oftheir fate if they went down the same ME/CFS retrovirus road.I was forced to return to Nevada under the threat of arrest, where a mug shotwas taken and published in a scandalous article in Science by Jon Cohen,designed to discredit me in the eyes of the scientific community and the greaterworld beyond. Science had achieved its goal and had the ammunition to force theretraction of the paper. My scientific career was destroyed.My life savings in the bank?Gone.Our homes?Gone.We spent it on lawyers trying to bring cases for the violation of my civilrights, the false claims, and to end this plague that reaches into every townand city in this country.Despite spending all that money without obtaining justice, I was forced todeclare bankruptcy. Not because I didn’t have the money. My attorneys believedthat if I appeared, “new” evidence would be found against me and I would end upin jail in Nevada, and possibly die under mysterious circumstances.“I don’t need to file bankruptcy,” I said. “I have a perfect credit score. I’llsell my houses and take my ninety-seven witnesses to Reno to the damages hearingof that fraudulent case. I’ll not only prove the science was right, but thatcrimes were committed against this patient population.”Dennis Jones, my civil attorney, was firm. “Let me tell you what will happen ifyou do that. When you step on the Reno courthouse steps, you will be immediatelyarrested by the district attorney, who will claim they have new evidence againstyou.”“That’s ridiculous,” I replied. “There’s no new evidence.”Dennis leaned forward and coldly said, “There was no evidence the first time,was there?”Tears welled up in my eyes. It was the only time I’d cried during the wholeordeal. I knew it almost killed my husband the first time I’d been jailed. Thistime, it certainly would.I declared bankruptcy. I believe I saved the life of my husband by this action.It was a strategic loss. I did not want to do it. However, sometimes you mustlose a battle to win a war.I have continued to fight.Have I spent many hours with FBI agents telling them about the corruption ofscience that I believe existed at the University of Nevada, Reno, NIH, CDC, FDA,and among our National Academy of Science leaders? Yes, I have. In fall 2018, Iwas notified that the false claims whistleblower case, which had been under sealfor three years, was no longer under seal, and I could serve the defendants.I filed a motion for clarification. Which defendants do I serve? On April 11,2019, I filed a criminal affidavit for extortion and obstruction of justice.As of this writing, I have not received an answer to either. I doubt justicewill ever be served on this Earth. The United States has abandoned anyallegiance to either Jeffersonian or Hamiltonian principles. I often think ofClint Eastwood’s line in the movie Unforgiven as the sheriff begs for his life,saying he doesn’t deserve this. Eastwood responds, “deserving’s got nothing todo with it.”Kent tells me that the freedom to publish a book and lay out your side of thestory may be the last actual freedom we have left in this country. Maybe he’sright. The courts are corrupt, the media, politicians, scientists, andphysicians are bought off or bullied into silence.It’s almost enough to turn an honest scientist into an outlaw."},{"pageContent":"images [../Images/line.jpg]CHAPTER TWOA Rebel from the Startimages [../Images/line.jpg]I was in the office of my boss, Russ, for one of our regular meetings. As Istood in front of his desk, clutching my lab book, he said something I’ve neverforgotten. “You have a moral, legal, and ethical responsibility to do exactly asI tell you.”It was the summer of 1987, I was twenty-nine years old, and I was at UpjohnPharmaceuticals, located in Kalamazoo, Michigan. The previous year I’d taken ajob at Upjohn as a lab technician in their Quality Control Department afterleaving my job at Fort Detrick, Maryland, as the Biological Response Modifiershad been dissolved. I didn’t know it when Russ made that statement, but I wasalready nearing the end of my career at Upjohn.Where is the good place in science?I asked that question many times during my decades in research. Was it ingovernment-sponsored science, which is supposed to be free of bias or politics?Or was it in industry, supported by the profit motive, which puts serious moneybehind advances that have the potential to change people’s lives? I have come tobelieve that both government-sponsored science and industry have the potentialfor enormous good. But both can also easily go awry if those in charge lackintegrity, which seems to be increasingly rare as one goes up the ladder ineither government-sponsored science or industry.I write this book in the hope that science can be guided back to its foundingprinciples.I wanted to be a doctor ever since I was a ten-year-old girl and watchedhelplessly as my beloved grandfather wasted away from lung cancer. I used tolisten to baseball games with him, and he kindled my lifelong love of sports.When I was a senior at the University of Virginia in 1980, I read a Timemagazine cover story on interferon, which at the time was being promoted as apotential breakthrough in cancer treatment. I got a job later that year as a labtechnician at the National Cancer Institute in Frederick, Maryland, and mycareer in science was launched. And what was my job? Purifying interferon-alpha.The program I loved the most at the National Cancer Institute was the BiologicalResponse Modifiers program, an interdisciplinary team of PhDs, MDs, nursepractitioners, and lab techs like me at Fort Detrick. During that time, we wereworking on adoptive transfers for AIDS patients, trying to understand howinterferon-alpha might help, or whether the immune markers like IL-2 and othercytokines might provide the clues we needed in order to save their lives.It was also a tumultuous time, as a controversy erupted over whether Dr. RobertGallo, the most quoted scientist of the 1980s and 1990s, had tried to claimcredit for the discovery of the HIV virus from French scientist Luc Montagnier.Was it an attempted theft or just an honest mistake?Montagnier would eventually win the Nobel Prize in 2008 for the discovery of theHIV virus, and Gallo’s name would be conspicuously absent. I developed strongopinions about Gallo and what scientists like him were doing to the profession.In 1986, the government in its infinite wisdom decided to eliminate theBiological Response Modifiers program. I would have to find a new position atthe Institute. Also, around that time, I observed a senior researcher directinga young Japanese postdoc to change data in an experiment. The postdoc wasclearly troubled by the order. Shortly after that exchange, he committed suicideby drinking sodium azide, a white solid that uncouples the electron transportchain, causing the person to suffocate and die. I went to the program director(Frank’s boss) and told him what I had witnessed. “I know why he killedhimself,” I said. My boss was uninterested. The senior researcher got results.The young Japanese postdoc was written off as suffering from emotional problems,leaving behind a wife and two small children.Later that day I got a call from one of my former coworkers, who was working forUpjohn. “Judy, we’ve got a job here for you and you’d really love it.” I wasborn in Michigan and had grown up rooting for the Detroit Tigers. Michigan washome. And the money was a lot better than working for the government.“I’m there,” I said.image [../Images/common.jpg]I was something of an oddball at Upjohn, but not for the reasons you mightthink.During most of my time at the National Cancer Institute, I worked for Frank, andwe had a natural sympathy for and common approach to science. Frank and Ithought nothing of arriving at work around four or five in the morning andsetting up our experiments, then working until six at night.Science was what we loved to do.Industry doesn’t work like that. At Upjohn researchers came in at abouteighty-thirty in the morning, worked until nine-forty-five, took afifteen-minute break, went back and worked until a little before noon, then tookoff for a thirty-minute lunch, had an afternoon break around two, then went backto work for the rest of the day. In the summertime at Upjohn, we got off atthree-thirty. The company had a number of intramural sports teams, and I playedon softball teams, ice hockey in the winter, and soccer. I laugh when I say Iplayed soccer, because I rarely ever touched the ball.Our soccer coach was a tall, handsome black man named Wayne, who oversaw humanresources. I used to run a lot and ride my bike, and I had quite a bit ofendurance. I’d never played soccer, had little coordination, but I wastenacious. Wayne saw that in me and had me shadow the other team’s bestoffensive players. I’d stick to them like superglue, and in frustration they’dcall out, “Get off of me! Get off of me!”We won games simply because I kept their best players from controlling the ball.It was Wayne who first let me know my work ethic was causing a personnelproblem. I’d come in three or four hours before my boss, Russ, arrived at nine.Nine in the morning was like the middle of the day to me. We were studying arecently marketed bovine growth hormone. Many other pharmaceutical companieswere marketing a similar product. The claim was that the hormone increased milkproduction without any side effects on the cattle. I thought it was a greatidea, but Upjohn didn’t have a biological division to study the effects of itsproducts on cell lines. They had a number of superb chemists and did excellentwork with their High-Performance Liquid Chromatography system as well as theirMass Spectrometer, but they really didn’t have researchers with a great deal ofbiological experience. That was one of the reasons I was so attractive toUpjohn. Part of what I was doing by coming in so early was designing the sametype of biological assays I’d done at the National Cancer Institute.“Why is it a problem?” I asked Wayne when he told me there was concern that Iwas coming in so early.“People don’t know what you’re doing,” he replied.“I’m working.”“You need to let people know what you’re doing,” said Wayne. He thought about itfor a moment. “How about you check in with Russ on a regular basis?”“Mr. Personality?” Russ was a little guy, I don’t think I ever saw him smile orlaugh, and he didn’t talk much. He was just a few years older than I and hadrecently received his PhD. He had a reddish beard and mustache, wore glasses,his lips often seemed clenched, and when you talked to him, he had a tendency tolook away. Yes, sir, he was a real people person.I went and asked Russ if he was okay with my coming in early to do work. He saidit was fine. I also asked if we could meet a few times a week, so I could updatehim on my work. He agreed but showed no visible emotion.However, another issue arose at Upjohn that drew me out of my work for Russ anddelayed our inevitable confrontation over bovine growth hormone.image [../Images/common.jpg]The product was called ATGAM, a drug for transplant recipients, and it wasderived from human blood. But this was 1986 and the AIDS epidemic was in fullswing, infecting hundreds of thousands of Americans every year, and creating aplague of slow death unlike anything seen in the United States for decades. HIVwas a blood-borne pathogen, and so while it had been confirmed that the viruscould pass from one individual to another through unprotected sex, the sharingof needles, as well as through blood transfusions, nobody knew if it wouldsurvive the manufacturing process for a product like ATGAM, produced from humanblood.The “official” government line was that HIV had not made it to Michigan and wasconfined to places like New York City and San Francisco.To their credit, Upjohn did not share the same sentiment.They were concerned that the possibility existed that the blood they weregetting from Michigan residents to make their product might contain HIV. Thehairdresser I started using when I arrived in Michigan told me he wasHIV-positive and would eventually die from AIDS.Since I had come from the National Cancer Institute, I had the kind ofbackground that could help answer the question of whether the manufacturingprocess would decontaminate any HIV that did make its way into the finalproduct. I quickly started interacting with a scientist named Bob, a wonderfulman, who headed up a different division at Upjohn. He had a brilliant mind, wasan opera singer, and just a delight to work with.I told him that in order to determine if their product was safe, all we neededto do was spike their raw blood product with HIV samples we could obtain fromthe National Cancer Institute, then after each stage of the production processwe would test to see if there had been at least a six-log reduction in thepresence of the virus. He thought it was a great idea and quickly agreed.I ran into trouble when I contacted the National Cancer Institute and asked ifwe could have some HIV samples sent to the Upjohn facility in Kalamazoo. SinceHIV was not officially recognized as existing in Michigan, I could not bring anysamples into the state. Did I want to be forever known as the woman who broughtHIV to Michigan?Bob came up with an ingenious, although unconventional solution. Upjohn had aLear jet that they often used to shuttle their executives and scientists toWashington, DC, to meet with officials of the Food and Drug Administration todiscuss their products.Did I want to start hopping on the Lear jet so I could perform my experiments atthe National Cancer Institute?Frank would assist me in the effort, since I was still simply a lowly labtechnician. (Poor Frank! Like a bad penny, I just kept coming back!) On Mondaymornings I would often board the Upjohn Lear jet with a backpack over myshoulder, fly to Washington (Reagan) National Airport, where I would be met onthe runway with my rental car, then drive to the National Cancer Institute inFrederick, Maryland, to perform the experiments or have meetings. Sometimes I’dfly back to Kalamazoo later that day, or sometimes I’d stay until the end of theweek, flying back on Friday night. During those times when I was able to staylonger, I could visit socially with my former coworkers, or spend time with mymother and stepfather, Ken.I also must comment on the somewhat clandestine nature of my flights toWashington.Here I was, a twenty-eight-year-old kid, jumping on a Lear jet with the topexecutives of Upjohn, and not really being able to talk to my fellow colleaguesabout what I was doing. I usually dress casual, wear jeans, and often a baseballcap, and there I was in a small Lear jet with the top executives of the company.Even at a young age I was a pretty good conversationalist, and soon I was onfriendly terms with a good number of the power players at Upjohn.It was nice to be working with Frank again. In a few weeks, we had theexperiments all set up and were in the midst of our investigation. I’m sure ithelped that our testing revealed that their manufacturing process did a good jobat removing the HIV virus from any potentially contaminated blood. I suggested afew minor changes, such as getting the temperature up for some of theirprocesses to add an extra layer of security, but it was already safe.Within my first few months at Upjohn, I’d already distinguished myself as acreative researcher, mixed with the top executives, made a lifelong friend inBob (years later in 1992, Frank and I invited Bob to speak at a conference inGenoa, Italy, that Frank was chairing, as Upjohn had done some excellent workwith HIV), and had a lot of fun playing on the intramural sports teams, allwithout having a PhD.But it was time to get back to the job they hired me for, namely, workingquality control, establishing a biological quality control division with celllines on which to test their genetically modified biological products,investigating the claims for the safety of their bovine growth hormone.image [../Images/common.jpg]At the time, I thought it was a great idea to use bovine growth hormone toincrease milk production and help cattle grow to maturity quicker.My job was to make sure it was safe.The claim was that bovine growth hormone did not affect human cells. My job asquality control was to see if it was true or not.I set up the experiments, using several different cell lines, added the bovinegrowth hormone, and waited to see what happened.The claim that bovine growth hormone didn’t affect the cells was false.One of the first things I saw in the cell cultures was the bovine growth hormonewas affecting the morphology (appearance) of the adipocytes, commonly known asthe fat cells. Simply put, the fat cells were changing their appearance and notlooking like healthy fat cells. In addition, when I tested to see whether thefat cells were producing the typical molecules of a healthy fat cell, impactingthings like communication with other cells, I found there was a significantdifference. The fat cells that had been treated with bovine growth hormone wereproducing different molecules. In all likelihood, these different molecules wereaffecting the function of other cell types.I saw several examples of cells that had a condition called blebbing, in which acell detaches its cytoskeleton from the cellular membrane, causing the membraneto swell into spherical bubbles. The proper working of the cellular membrane iscritical in communicating with other cells, so what I was observing was probablycausing a breakdown in cellular communication. I also observed some largeneurite outgrowths, stringy-looking cells that were abnormal.My research was leading me to a simple, but dangerous conclusion.Bovine growth hormone profoundly affected human cell cultures.A great deal of my work at the National Cancer Institute had centered on immunedysfunction caused by retroviral infection. I learned not only how to identifythem, but also what conditions were likely to allow for their persistence,greatly increasing the odds for immune dysfunction leading to cancer. Manyretroviruses that have affected species in the past have been assimilated intoour genetic makeup.These are known as endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), meaning that they haveessentially been disarmed, and we are now living peacefully with them. However,if conditions in the body become abnormal, these viruses can rise up and causedisease.I recall asking Frank at one point whether the abnormalities I was observing inthe cell cultures could allow for a long-dormant bovine leukemia virus (BLV) incows to start being a problem. Frank was well known in the field as he andBernie Poiesz isolated the first disease-causing human retrovirus, HTLV-1, aleukemia virus. Frank had published several papers on BLV, and I had done thetechnical studies. Robert Gallo would essentially get all the credit for HTLV-1,while Frank and Bernie not only got little recognition, but were fired forgetting “too much credit.” Frank thought my question about immune abnormalitieswaking up sleeping retroviruses was a valid concern.I spent a lot of time working on the effect of bovine growth hormone ondifferent cell cultures. It wasn’t simply a single experiment.I took pictures of the cells, showing them swollen and abnormal-looking, howthey had become multinucleated, the stringy neurite outgrowths, and how many ofthem were dying.I had the readouts of the abnormal molecules, and just as I had reported thatthe manufacturing process of one Upjohn product would decontaminate HIV, myresearch on bovine growth hormone was leading me to an opposite conclusion. Ialways figured a scientist was like an umpire in a baseball game, calling ballsand strikes as he sees them.And that’s what led me to be in Russ’s office, with the data that the bovinegrowth hormone would not pass biological quality control. And I could just feelhim getting angry, seething inside that I was making his life more difficult,because I was telling him he needed to stop the manufacture of the product,until we could determine whether it was safe. There were other companies, likeMonsanto, who were selling similar products, and if we raised the red flag, theywould eventually have to follow suit, as well.I knew it might cause problems, but that wasn’t my concern as a lab technician.The data were the data.Angry words were exchanged, I stood from my seat, turning to leave, and that’swhen Russ asked for my notebook and said the words that remain burned in mymemory thirty years later, “You have a moral, legal, and ethical responsibilityto do exactly as I tell you.”Russ wanted my notebook, and I knew that to some extent he was right. Upjohnpaid my salary. The work I had done belonged to them. But I wanted to make astatement.“You want my notebook? Well, here!”An old boyfriend of mine, Don Kent, was a Frisbee champion. So instead of simplythrowing the notebook at him, I turned it into a Frisbee and sent it sailingjust over his head. Russ ducked, moving quicker than I’d ever seen him move. Thenotebook hit a bulletin board right behind him, knocking off a couple of notesbefore it fell to the floor.I stormed out of his office and went to see Wayne, the human resources managerwhose office was nearby, and exposed him to the ruckus.His eyes silently asked the question, “What happened?”“He’s an idiot!” I said quickly.Wayne laughed. Nobody in the lab liked Russ. “A little more detail, please?”I told him about the bovine growth hormone experiments, what I thought should bedone, how I thought Russ wasn’t going to do anything about it, and finally, theFrisbee toss of my notebook at Russ.“You can’t say that, Judy,” Wayne said, in response to how I was attempting totell Upjohn what they had to do. “And you can’t throw things at your boss.”“He deserved it.”“Maybe.” Wayne was quiet for a minute, and I felt bad for putting him in such aspot.“It’s okay. It’s not your problem, Wayne,” I said. “I need to go home anyway.Let me call Frank.”The previous day I’d received a call from my mother, letting me know that mystepfather, Ken, had come down with an aggressive type of prostate cancer at theage of fifty-five. She’d wanted to know if there was any way I could come homeand help her through what was likely to be a difficult time. The problem wasthat my stepsiblings had lost their mother to breast cancer, Ken didn’t want hischildren to know about his cancer. If I was going back to Washington, DC, thatmeant I’d be back in the neighborhood of the National Cancer Institute inBethesda, Maryland, a distance of fewer than ten miles.When I reached Frank, I explained what had happened and broached a topic we hadput off-limits long ago. Early in my time with Frank, he told me about the abusehe’d suffered at the hands of Robert Gallo, and I told him about a chemistryteacher at the University of Virginia who was adamant that women should neverbecome doctors. He gave terrible grades to any woman in his class, and itdestroyed my dream of going to medical school.After we’d shared our individual traumas, I’d said that we each had our ownforbidden “G” words.I wouldn’t say Gallo, and he wouldn’t suggest graduate school. But things weredifferent now.“I’m ready to talk about graduate school,” I said to Frank. There were severallab technicians who were working at the National Cancer Institute who weregetting their graduate degrees at George Washington University. “Can you get meinto George Washington?” I asked.“I think so,” said Frank.“And can I get my old job back?”“Probably not. But I can get you some contract work here. We’ll figure it out.”Frank was always good to me. It’s why we have a consulting business togethermore than thirty-five years after we first met. Upjohn was good to me, as well.When the next company newsletter came out, they announced with great fanfarethat I’d been accepted at George Washington University for graduate school, andthey hoped I would consider returning to them in the future.As for Russ, he was assigned to take sensitivity training for his part in ourdispute.image [../Images/common.jpg]In September of 2015, researchers from the University of California at Berkeleyreleased the findings of their investigation on the presence of bovine leukemiavirus (BLV) in the breast cancer tissue of 239 women. Fifty-nine percent of thebreast cancer tissue samples showed evidence of exposure to BLV, while only 29percent of tissue samples from women who never had breast cancer showed evidenceof exposure to the virus.In a press release from UC Berkeley, the lead author, Gertrude Behring, said:Studies done in the 1970s failed to detect evidence of human infection withbovine leukemia virus. The tests we have now are more sensitive, but it wasstill hard to overturn the established dogma that bovine leukemia virus was nottransmissible to humans. As a result, there has been little incentive for thecattle industry to set up procedures to contain the spread of the virus. Thisodds ratio is higher than any of the frequently publicized risk factors forbreast cancer, such as obesity, alcohol consumption and use of post-menopausalhormones.1 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn2_1]There’s a great deal to consider in that statement. Maybe the tests in the 1970sweren’t sensitive enough to detect the presence of the virus in breast cancertissue. Another possibility is that maybe the cattle during that time weren’tplagued by bovine leukemia virus in the numbers that they are today.Could the use of bovine growth hormone introduced in the 1980s have changed theexpression of latent bovine leukemia virus that had been silenced in the geneticmakeup of cattle?Again, I don’t know.But it is a reasonable question and should be pursued with great vigor.And what do I conclude a person should do when a superior tells them, “You can’tsay that!” Well, it seems clear to me that in most instances the problem isn’tgoing to go away. I saw clear evidence in the 1980s that bovine growth hormonewas affecting cell cultures, making me wonder what effect that might have on theexpression of bovine leukemia virus in the milk from those hormone-treated cows.Today there’s a concern that BLV may be linked to breast cancer.What woman doesn’t worry about breast cancer at some point in her life?I understand that there’s a great gap between what I investigated and theresearch from UC Berkeley, but there shouldn’t be. We should understand theentire chain of cause and effect from the introduction of a new product to thepublic to its effect on human health. I realize the process can be difficult andtime-consuming, but we’re talking about people’s lives.Science is supposed to be about answering difficult, even unpopular questions.When I first interviewed with Frank, he wanted to hire me but got a thumbs-downfrom the division manager. When asked why, the woman replied, “She asks too manyquestions.” Frank thought that was exactly what was needed in science and wentover her head to hire me.If you do keep talking when people tell you to be quiet, most times there willbe good people like Wayne or Frank to watch out for you, even if you cross aline or two. I’ve generally found that in whatever situation you find yourself,there will be people who respect honesty and will act to support those who speakthe truth.However, there will still be times when you find yourself alone. There will beno safety net. And you must make the choice of whether to tell the truth,regardless of whether a single person will support you. These situations do notoccur often in a lifetime.They are rare.But they reveal character.Like a fireman who decides to run into a burning building to save a child. Orindividuals who run toward the sound of gunfire, rather than away from it. Thosewho decide to help people with deadly diseases. Or someone reporting an abusiveboss or company fraud.These are the decisions that define a person.If you can speak out about an important issue, when others tell you to be quiet,and you don’t know if anybody on the face of the planet will support you, thattoo, my friend, requires great faith.Choose wisely.And if you can avoid it, don’t throw notebooks at your boss, even if it’sFrisbee style."},{"pageContent":"images [../Images/line.jpg]CHAPTER THREEThe Dead Doctors—What Is Real?images [../Images/line.jpg]When I was an undergraduate at the University of Virginia, one of my friends,Jenny, had a t-shirt that read, What is real? It seemed like a cool,sophisticated line to this young college student. But it has taken on a deepermeaning to me over the years. I constantly find myself asking what I reallyknow. I know what people tell me, and what I see on television or read in thenewspapers. I’ll take from that information a working understanding of theworld, but I’ve learned not to hold those views too tightly.Take for example my college roommate, Teri. She told me her parents, Thomas andLucille, were career diplomats. I even rented a room in the house they bought inCharlottesville during our senior year. I felt boring compared to Tom andLucille, who were worldly, sharing stories of their travels to exotic locations.I loved them and our wide-ranging conversations. I studied my ass off innutritional biology and chemistry, got up at four in the morning to row crew,spent my days in the lab, and stayed away from marijuana because I knew it wasfat soluble, which meant it remained in your body for decades.Thirty years later I learned Thomas and Lucille weren’t diplomats, but agents ofthe Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Thomas was CIA station chief in Warsaw,Poland, from 1980 to 1982, just after Teri and I graduated. In November 1981,Thomas and Lucille smuggled Polish colonel Ryszard Kuklinski, a member of thePolish General Staff, from a remote street corner into the United StatesEmbassy, where another CIA team whisked him out of the country. Kuklinski hadbeen an American spy for nine years and carried with him Soviet plans for apossible invasion of Western Europe through Poland. He also carried with himsecret documents regarding how the trade union Solidarity would be suppressed ifit gained too much power. It was one of the greatest intelligence coups of theCold War.If you think I’m sharing national security secrets you’d be wrong, as theheroism of Thomas and Lucille Ryan was prominently featured in the 2004 book ASecret Life: The Polish Officer, His Covert Mission, and the Price He Paid toSave His Country1 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn3_1] and awarded the coveted titleof Washington Post Best Book. Famed Watergate reporter Bob Woodward called it“the epic spy story of the Cold War.”I also questioned what was real in 1993, when my stepbrother, Kevin, a UnitedStates Park Police Officer, was first to find the body of Vince Foster, theDeputy White House Counsel under President Bill Clinton, dead of an apparentself-inflicted gunshot wound in Fort Marcy Park. My stepbrother never saw a gunin Foster’s hand, as reported by later eyewitnesses, and a great deal about thescene struck my stepbrother as disturbing.The bodies of suicide victims who die by gunshot are usually contorted, butFoster was laid out rather casually on the slope of a small hill, as if he’dsimply decided to lie down and take a nap. No pieces of his blown-out skull andlittle blood were found on the small berm, and there were no flash burns fromthe shot that was supposedly fired from point-blank range at the soft palette ofhis mouth. There were other curiosities, such as the lack of dirt on his shoes,powder burn particles on other parts of his clothes, a blonde hair from somebodywho was not his wife, unidentified carpet fibers, and semen stains in hisshorts, suggesting recent sexual activity.2 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn3_2]By all accounts, Vince Foster was a straight arrow, but he’d had a longacquaintance with the Clintons. He’d known Bill Clinton since they were inkindergarten together, and he’d worked with Hillary Clinton when they were bothpartners at the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Arkansas. In what was claimed tobe a draft resignation letter found torn up in his briefcase after his death, heallegedly wrote, “I was not meant for the job or the spotlight of public life inWashington. Here ruining people is considered sport.”3[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn3_3] The inconsistencies in the story and the evidencespawned many theories, including that Foster had been conducting an affair withthe First Lady and become despondent in light of their mounting scandals andkilled himself in a secret apartment where they regularly met, or that he’dbecome a liability to the Clintons and they had him killed.My stepbrother could offer no evidence for any of these claims.But he was steadfast in his belief that the crime scene as he first observed itdiffered greatly from what was in the official report. I saw in my stepbrother’sexperience how easy it was for a person simply trying to do their job to getswept up in a storm not of their making.image [../Images/common.jpg]I was struck nearly speechless in May of 2018 as I stood on the main stage ofthe Autism One Conference in Chicago, Illinois, in front of more than a thousandpeople and was presented with the Dr. Jeff Bradstreet Courage in Medicine Award.It had been a long road, from our groundbreaking 2009 publication in theprestigious journal Science, to my firing and jailing in 2011, the forcedretraction, the years of my forced bankruptcy, and attempts to obtain a singleday in court on my legal claims. After my supposed fall from grace in science,I’ve been fortunate to meet many other wonderful renegades and rebels, who’vegiven me their love and support. There’s a common expression these days: “beingred-pilled.” It comes from the science-fiction film The Matrix, in which thehero is given the option of taking the blue pill and remaining asleep, or thered pill, which will open his eyes to the reality of what is happening in theworld.I’d been red-pilled for maybe eight years, and what a ride it had been. I’dsurvived the journey, although with a greatly reduced bank account andscientific reputation.However, Dr. Jeff Bradstreet and many others had not.image [../Images/common.jpg]I believe I first met Jeff Bradstreet at a conference in Frankfurt, Germany, in2012.Jeff was one of the premier physicians in the United States treating vaccineinjury. From the beginning, he understood our approach of looking at autism asan acquired immune deficiency associated with a retroviral infection, similar inmany ways to HIV-AIDS. Jeff was accompanied by Drs. Marco Ruggiero, an Italianresearcher, and Paul Cheney, whom I’d long known, since my research into ME/CFS.Cheney was one of the first two researchers to identify what came to be known asthe Lake Tahoe/Incline Village ME/CFS Outbreak of 1984–1985, which paralleled inmany ways the AIDS epidemic.The three of them were working on a therapy called GcMAF (or Gc protein-derivedmacrophage activating factor), a protein produced by modification of vitaminD-binding protein, which activates the body’s macrophages to fight infection. Itwas first used as a cancer and HIV therapy. Macrophages are the orchestrators ofthe immune system response, and what we’ve learned about retroviruses is thatpart of their survival strategy is to confuse the immune response. If you canget your macrophages working properly, they will attack the viruses, and healingcan begin. That’s the way nature intended humans to defend themselves.Bradstreet, Ruggiero, and Cheney were working with GcMAF and a man from Englandnamed David, whom I distrusted from the start. He drank a lot at that meetingand bragged about how much money he was making by selling GcMAF, and thatimmediately rang my alarm bells. I’m a scientist interested in ending humansuffering. I understand people need to make money, but that shouldn’t be thething you brag about.I was trying to recover my scientific career, having been promised to beincluded in future studies by Ian Lipkin and John Coffin. They both stated to methere was plenty of evidence for other retroviruses in ME/CFS, but we simplyneeded to get the validation study out of the way so we could rid ourselves ofthe VP62 issue. My civil attorney, Dennis Jones, told me that with thebankruptcy I could simply say I’d lost my grants and be free to return to myresearch on XMRV and other retroviruses associated with ME/CFS and cancer. Asyou can guess, all those promises came to nothing.Then in 2013 an invitation came from David to present at a conference in Dubaiin the United Arab Emirates. Bradstreet and Ruggiero would also be there. “I’mgoing to rescue your career,” David told me over the phone, offering to pay formy plane tickets and hotel accommodations. That was generous and welcome, as wewere confident that GcMAF could be of therapeutic value for the patients, assome of my friends in the United Kingdom had been emailing me with encouragingstories.Shortly after announcing I was going to attend the conference in Dubai, I gotcalls and emails from several people with concerns. They said, “Don’t go toDubai. Something will happen.” One caller, a friend I’d known for a long time,said, “You’re not the only person threatened. They also want to take outBradstreet and Ruggiero.”I was concerned because I’d also heard from Cheney that in the previous yearsomebody had cut a hole in his office wall and stolen his computer. Is therereally a black market for a doctor’s computer? This was sounding suspiciouslylike Watergate-style corruption.I didn’t cancel immediately.I called David, trying to learn more about the arrangements, and immediately sawsome holes in the security. I’d fly into the airport in Dubai, then be picked upby somebody I didn’t know who would drive me for about an hour to the meetinglocation. I asked David if he could have somebody I knew pick me up at theairport. He did not answer, but a staff member said that was not possible. Icalled the hotel and asked if they could have a driver pick me up but was alsoturned down.I contacted my lawyer, David Follin, and presented him with my dilemma. “Youcannot go to lawless places,” he warned. “You can’t go to Dubai. You can’t go toMexico. You can’t go to Nevada. You can’t go to India. You will disappear.”That was enough for me.I called the hotel and cancelled the reservation and emailed David. Bycoincidence, Lucille Ryan was gravely ill with a blood clot. There was nothingmore important than being with Lucille in her time of need.Yes, I avoided going to a dangerous place in the Middle East by using the excusethat I had to help an ailing CIA agent who had helped orchestrate one of thegreatest intelligence thefts from the Soviet Union. These are the absurdities ofa life spent around Washington, DC, and in government science. If there is sucha thing as the Deep State, I probably know a lot of members.If they asked for anything, I would be there to help.This is about all of us.image [../Images/common.jpg]In 2014, I was at Autism One again.I’d first attended in 2010, shortly after the publication in Science, which iswhere I first met my coauthor, Kent Heckenlively.At Autism One in 2014, there was a special Doctor’s Roundtable funded by ClaireDwoskin of the Children’s Medical Safety Research Institute and Barry Segal ofFocus for Health. We try not to discuss the plague of corruption we all know isswirling around the various chronic diseases and instead focus on the best waysof getting patients better.The meeting was set to begin in a few minutes when Bradstreet and Ruggieropulled me aside in the hallway. Ruggiero asked, “In five words or less, whydidn’t you show up at Dubai?”“Credible threat on our lives,” I said, then paused for a moment before adding,“All of us.”That seemed to send a chill through them.Bradstreet gave me a big hug and thanked me. They knew I didn’t have a dog inthis fight. I didn’t have an injured child, as Bradstreet did.Bradstreet asked, “Is there anything we can do to help you?”“Yeah,” I replied. “I’ve been kind of out of the loop on the recent scientificliterature and I can’t get to any of the journals and I’m locked out of themedical libraries. Can you help me with getting some access, so I can catch up?”Bradstreet had just given a talk at Autism One that I’d missed, and he had aflash drive with all of the data on it from recent papers and his own work. Hepulled out his flash drive. “Here, this will catch you up.”I downloaded the material to my computer and gave it back to him.Over the next year I met with Claire, Marco, and Jeff a few times at Jeff’sclinic in southern California. I visited with several families, reviewed theirprotocols with GcMAF, cold light laser therapy, antiretroviral therapies, andcannabis to help repair the damaged neurological system. I believe we also metat least once in Washington, DC, and were often on the phone comparing notes.Autism One of 2015 was filled with a sense of palpable excitement. Dr. AndrewWakefield was there with his documentary film crew including Del Bigtree andPolly Tommey. Their film VAXXED: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe was based on thedevastating revelations of Dr. William Thompson, a senior scientist at theCenters for Disease Control, who revealed that from the years 2001 to 2004 thefederal government covered up links between the MMR (measles-mumps-rubella)vaccine and autism, particularly among African American males. Thompson hadapplied for and been granted whistle-blower status in 2014 but had not testifiedbefore Congress. (Thompson still has not testified as of the date of thiswriting in 2019.)Bradstreet was very excited, giving the keynote talk, and many of us felttogether we had finally broken through to understand the underlying mechanisms,the interplay between the various systems, and how we might effectivelyintervene for hundreds of thousands of vaccine-injured children. I rememberpassing Jeff in the hallway as he was on the way to one of his talks and I wason the way to mine and giving him a high-five. We had this. There was nostopping us now.I expected we would talk again in the next few weeks.That was the last time I saw my friend Jeff Bradstreet alive.image [../Images/common.jpg]On June 17, 2015, the office of Dr. Bradstreet in Buford, Georgia, was raided byfederal agents from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the DrugEnforcement Agency (DEA). They were on the scene for several hours.Kent later conducted a long interview with Jeff’s brother, Thomas, about theraid. Thomas said, “I’m sensitive to the word ‘raid’ because it comes with somuch guilt and weight attached to it. It’s like a drug bust. They come in, armedwith M-16s, they take the money, they take the drugs, and it’s off to jail.That’s not what happened. They came into his office. They did look at financialrecords. They took some USB drives. They took some information out of hiscomputers. They didn’t lock him down. They didn’t take his passport. . . . Hewasn’t arrested. They didn’t seize bank accounts or freeze them. It was justharassment. It wasn’t some horrible thing; my life is over.”4[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn3_4] According to Thomas, his brother contacted someattorneys who told him that the worst he was looking at was a fine.Late in the afternoon of June 19, 2015, a fisherman reported a floating body ina stream that led into Lake Lure, a popular tourist destination in NorthCarolina. It was Jeff Bradstreet, dead of a single gunshot wound to the chest.If the reports are to be believed, Jeff drove to an inn at Lake Lure to meet hiswife. She was to meet him there later after dropping off her autistic son withher ex-husband. On the way up to the lake, Jeff stopped and bought groceries,but when he arrived at the inn, they informed him his room was not ready. Hesaid he’d come back in a few hours and gave the attendant his cell phone number,so he could let him know when the room was available.We’re supposed to believe Jeff then drove five miles to a stream, took out hispistol, waded into the water, then from what appeared to be a nearly impossibleangle, shot himself in the chest. In addition, the medical examiner brought inby the family commented that there were no flash burns on his clothing or skin,as would be expected if he had fired the fatal shot. Jeff had been an Air Forcepilot and an emergency room physician in a high crime area of St. Louis. He’dfought the FDA a decade earlier in court and won. He was tough.The only wrinkle in all of this is whether Jeff’s family had been threatened. Iknow that during my baptism of fire, those who were against me came after myhusband, David, trying to convince him that I was crazy and dangerous. Turnthose closest to you against you. I’m told that Jeff’s widow has been veryreluctant to help Thomas Bradstreet in the investigation of his brother’s death.I suspect she is terrified by what might happen to her children if she speaksout.When I got the call on my cell phone during a sailing race in southernCalifornia, the facts were unclear. First, I heard it was a heart attack, then adrowning, and finally a suicide. After the information came in, I tried to makesense of it, but it didn’t add up. I don’t believe for a minute that Jeff wassuicidal. He was a warrior as well as a strong Christian. If he died by his ownhand, it was a sacrifice to protect those he loved.It seemed like Vince Foster all over again, but the truth is, I didn’t have anyidea what was real.image [../Images/common.jpg]One begins to realize it’s dangerous to be a renegade against the establishment.Strange men following you on your bike and watching your house, and deaths undersuspicious circumstances. I’d sleep much better at night if I didn’t have toconsider these possibilities. But you think to yourself, well, maybe people likeme have a renegade streak. One day we’re discovering a phantom virus causing amysterious epidemic and the next we’re being raided by the federal government.Maybe there’s something to what people like me are saying, and we’ll discoverwhat it is in ten or twenty years.But there’s probably a good deal of nonsense, as well.However, I think it’s just as dangerous to be a member of the establishment andhave a conscience. Because, you see, I was a scientist with the government formore than twenty years, starting with Fort Detrick, Maryland, and the NationalCancer Institute.I understand the innate goodness of most government scientists, trying toimprove the health of humanity. It took me a long time to realize those at thevery top probably understand this darkness, the stories they don’t want thepublic to know. But I think there are many working near the top who don’t seethe darkness.image [../Images/common.jpg]During the controversy over XMRV and its relation to diseases such as ME/CFS andautism, we had no fiercer critic that Kuan Teh-Jeang, the editor in chief ofRetrovirology and second in command to Tony Fauci at the National Institute forAllergy and Infectious Diseases.At first, we were puzzled by Teh-Jeang’s violent reaction to our work.Frank Ruscetti and I had worked with Teh-Jeang in the early days of HIV researchand HTLV-1 (human T-cell leukemia virus), the first human disease-causingretrovirus. Teh-Jeang was an intelligent, charismatic little man always lookingfor ways to increase the participation of minorities in the biological sciences,which up until that time had mainly been the province of white men.Teh-Jeang was a top-notch scientist.However, on December 22, 2010, Teh-Jeang took the unusual step of allowing thesimultaneous publication of six negative articles about our XMRV research aseditor of the journal Retrovirology. I say it was unusual because Frank hadtalked to several of the reviewers of the papers who told us they hadrecommended the papers not be published because of significant flaws. Nonepassed peer review. One of the peer reviewers told Frank that in response tothese criticisms Teh-Jeang admitted the papers in and of themselves were not upto the proper scientific standard for publication, but “together they make apoint and they stand.” In a later editorial from August of 2012, Teh-Jeangseemed to take an almost ghoulish delight in the attack he launched on XMRV.In this respect, a significant example can be drawn from the six Retrovirologypapers published in December 2010 that were the first to pivotally correct thethen held belief that XMRV was an etiological cause of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(CFS). In that instance, Retrovirology’s Open Access format was particularlyinstrumental in permitting interested individuals who were not careerscientists, to freely, rapidly, and fully access those paradigm-changingpeer-reviewed publications.5 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn3_5]You’d think he was tracking down a murderer with the glee in which he attackedfindings barely a year old but that had been vetted by the highest levels of thepublic health establishment in July of 2009. As I read that section of theeditorial, what it said to me is “I can hoodwink other health professionals notfamiliar with viruses to believe this nonsense because they don’t know anybetter.”You’d be hard-pressed to find anybody to say Teh-Jeang had a habit of actinginappropriately. But that’s exactly what he did in 2011 when he stood up in ascientific meeting in Leuven, Belgium, as Frank Ruscetti was getting ready totalk and started shouting, “Stop studying this! Study a real virus! Stop wastingmoney on this! Wasting money! Wasting money!”I was in Frank’s office at the National Cancer Institute on Monday morning,January 28, 2013, when Kathy came into the room with the news that KuanTeh-Jeang was dead.At first it was said he’d died of a heart attack at his office on Sunday night.Then we heard that he’d shot himself at his desk.The last story I heard was that he killed himself by jumping off the four-storyparking garage at the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases.Really?You kill yourself by jumping thirty feet to the pavement? It might kill you, butthere’s also going to be a whole lot of pain.To this day, I have no idea how he died.image [../Images/common.jpg]I’d like to share with you a passage from Kuan Teh-Jeang’s obituary inRetrovirology.To his friends he was always known as Teh.Teh had an infectious enthusiasm and winner’s mentality both at work and play.He was a skilled tennis and chess player, a gifted writer, and a great debaterwith strong opinions on virtually all subjects of science and life in general.Additionally, he had a passion for current events and a love of travel, movies,food, and music.Teh’s death is a blow to the retrovirus research community and we will sorelymiss his scientific leadership. He has been central to so much of what we haveaccomplished together as well as being a supportive and generous friend to manyof us individually.Teh was a friend and colleague to many at BioMed Central, past and present. Hispassing at such a young age caused shock and great sadness. He wassimultaneously one of our most solid friends and supporters, while also being atireless force driving change and improvement, reminding us not to sit on ourlaurels, and always ready with forthright but constructive criticism when hethought we needed to do better.6 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn3_6]We endorse everything that was said about Teh-Jeang in his obituary. That wasconsistent with the scientist we’d known for decades. However, it was notconsistent with the man who opposed us in the XMRV debate. That person wasunhinged.Here’s the only explanation for Teh-Jeang’s death that makes sense to me.I think it’s entirely likely that in the middle of the XMRV debate, Teh-Jeangbelieved what people like Tony Fauci and John Coffin were saying, that XMRV wassimply a lab contaminant and had not infected the population in great numbers.These arguments take place on the very edge of scientific knowledge, so when awell-educated person makes a claim and seems to have some reasonable evidence,it’s easy to believe them.Teh-Jeang’s obituary talks about how he was a “tireless force driving change”and was always urging people to “do better.” Even though he’d savagely attackedXMRV, as the editor of Retrovirology he was able to see the latest research,prior to publication. He got to see all the papers. His job was to know thingsBEFORE other people knew them. Other scientists were discovering differentstrains of XMRV and how it was associated with disease, which is exactly whatone would expect with a newly discovered retrovirus family.It’s likely that XMRV is like Spleen Focus Forming Virus, which needs anotherhelper virus in order to cause damage. Viruses will combine and recombine withother viruses in the vicinity, making it a challenge to identify which virus iscausing the problem. Even in HIV, most of the viruses are defective. They’re notinfectious and transmissible. They’re doing their damage to the immune systemthrough other mechanisms.I believe Teh-Jeang was smart enough to understand this exotic biology,especially when even critics like Coffin were finding that XMRVs might need aslittle as ten days to recombine with another virus and create a new replicationcompetent retrovirus.7 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn3_7] These viruses might bebits and pieces of other viruses, which is why if you looked at the virus toonarrowly, you’d miss it. Those who really understand viruses know the bestcomparison of a virus is probably to a piece of computer code. Yes, if you havean entire computer program, like a complete virus, that’s probably a more robustsystem. But you can also have strings of computer code that can mess up yourmachine. I think in a similar way you often don’t need an entire virus, maybejust a few hundred base pairs of a viral envelope, perhaps, to affect immunefunction. We call these viral particles and act as if they’re not harmful, but Ithink that view is likely to be mistaken.I think Teh-Jeang was troubled by this. He started to figure it out. At first,he probably kept his doubts to himself. Then he’d start to discuss his concernswith a few close friends, people able to understand the science and thepolitics, like his boss, Tony Fauci. There are three people I place in whatFrank Ruscetti calls the “Unholy Trinity of Science,” and they are HaroldVarmus, Francis Collins, and Tony Fauci. Whenever you ask yourself why the truthhasn’t been told in a critical area of public health, you’ll probably find thefingerprints of these men at the crime scene.How does Fauci respond? Maybe he tries to convince Teh-Jeang that his fears areunwarranted. But Teh-Jeang would persist. He’d want facts. Fauci couldn’tprovide those, and if he did lie, Teh-Jeang would see through the lies. Thesystem depends on smart people.But in order to draw those people in, you must also make them believe in whatthey’re doing. It sets up an imbalance if you’re going to do somethingunethical.Every scientist wants to think their work has integrity. To call a scientist aliar is the worst epithet you can use. I strongly believe an impasse was reachedbetween Fauci and his second in command, Teh-Jeang. What happened after thatpoint? I can’t tell you. Was Teh-Jeang shamed by what he’d done? As a Chineseman, honor was very important to him.Did he do things of which he was ashamed?Or did Fauci, after it was clear to him that Teh-Jeang could not be turned,place a call and give an order? Was Teh-Jeang getting ready to go rogue? Faucimight not have known what exactly would happen, but he knew something wouldhappen.The rumor is that Teh-Jeang left a suicide note, which was confiscated by theNational Institutes of Health police.I wonder if it resembles the torn-up note found in Vince Foster’s briefcase.image [../Images/common.jpg]How long have suspicious deaths taken place in government science? I wish Icould say it was a new phenomenon. I suspect it is not.As I said earlier, from 1983 to 1986, I worked with Frank Ruscetti in theBiological Response Modifiers program at Fort Detrick, Maryland. It was theearly days of HIV research, and I was a technician, spending most of my time ina Bio-Safety Level 3 facility, which is probably a good thing when all thechemical and biological weapons that had been used and were stored on the basewere later revealed. The building I worked in had once been used to testweaponized anthrax. It was a charming place.I caught a senior scientist changing his data and reported it to the programdirector. I’m the one who got chewed out. That incident is what made me stopworking for the federal government and spend a brief amount of time working inthe corporate world at Upjohn.As I look back on my time at Fort Detrick, several things become clear to me.In 1985, we were in the heat of HIV-AIDS research, with everybody knowing thatNobel Prizes were on the line, billions of dollars from treatment protocols, andmillions who were angrily calling for us to find an answer to their terminaldisease. I remember going to meetings several times and having to pass thoughACT-UP protests where people were shouting at us that we didn’t care about themand were lying about what was really making them sick. I was in my midtwentiesand in my naïveté, believed we were doing everything possible.Sodium azide is a nasty chemical, which uncouples your respiratory chain, so youcan’t make oxygen. You literally drown in your own secretions. One femaletechnician took some sodium azide from the lab, went to a local park, sat on arock, and drank it, killing herself. And I’ve already mentioned the postdoctoralstudent, a Japanese man with a wife and two kids, who I was told had beeninstructed to falsify data. He also died from drinking sodium azide.They eventually banned sodium azide from the lab.I have nothing but respect for the intentions of people who want to pursue alife in science. My anger is with those who betray the search for truth. I thinkit’s very plausible that honest people stumbling upon corruption can become sodespondent that they kill themselves.But I also think it’s likely that procedures are in place to deal with those whoare not willing to go along with the program. I’m not saying there haven’t beentimes in my ordeal where I haven’t been very despondent. However, for therecord, I will never kill myself.image [../Images/common.jpg]Do these suspicious deaths of leading doctors and scientists continue to thisday?They do.In January of 2018, a writer named Baxter Dmitry published an article in whichhe claimed a senior scientist at the Centers for Disease Control told him, “Someof the patients I’ve administered the flu shot to this year have died. I don’tcare who you are, this scares the crap out of me. We have seen people dyingacross the country of the flu, and the one thing nearly all of them have incommon is they got the flu shot.”8 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn3_8]On February 12, 2018, Dr. Timothy Cunningham left his job at the Centers forDisease Control early, claiming he didn’t feel well. If we are to believe thenews accounts, after arriving home, he put on his black jogging shoes, went fora run, and disappeared.Dmitry then revealed that his anonymous CDC doctor was none other than Dr.Timothy Cunningham. When NBC News reported on the mysterious disappearance aweek later, this is what they had from Joe Carlos, a friend of Cunningham’s fromMorehouse College. The two were going to attend a gala at Morehouse:“Our last communication the week prior was about hanging out before and goingdown to the VIP reception and enjoying ourselves,” Carlos said. “I can speak formyself and so many classmates that this is very, very shocking.”Cunningham’s friends described him as opinionated, positive, and happy— and theynoted his reliability.“He has this pristine service record and background, and then he’s also the guyyou can call to help you move furniture or get together with you at a restaurantat the end of a long day,” said Calloway, who also knew Cunningham from collegeand maintained a close relationship with him over the years.9[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn3_9]In October of 2017, Dr. Cunningham had been named a “40 under 40 Award Honoree”by the Atlanta Business Chronicle and sat for an interview with them.When asked about his work he said, “I’m very fortunate to love what I do. Thatdoes not mean it is always easy, but my passion for the work helps sustain mewhen it gets hard. My advice is to do what you love. Love what you do. Do notquit. Keep going. During the bad, pick yourself up and learn from it. Finally,take time to celebrate during the good times.”10 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn3_10]Cunningham was also asked what skills and attributes a person under forty canbring to a workplace to make it grow. He replied, “Be flexible. Move beyond yourtraditional silos. Be aware of your inherent biases. Be open-minded and willingto learn. Open yourself up to get to know people different from you and let themknow you as well.” Sounds a lot like my approach to science.On April 3, 2018, more than seven weeks after he’d disappeared, some fishermenin the Chattahoochee River spotted a body tangled in debris. It was Dr. TimothyCunningham.In his final conversation with his sister, Tiana, Cunningham had told her “Youhave to figure things out for yourself.”11 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn3_11] Tianalater recalled that her brother sounded paranoid.In an extensive article for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution on June 4, 2018, anew narrative about Timothy Cunningham began to emerge:To those who knew him best, Timothy Cunningham was a well-educated, motivatedcareer man who felt it was his purpose to change lives. But in his personallife, Cunningham struggled with his sexuality, was upset he hadn’t landed apromotion, and lived with a chronic disease, family and friends told Atlantapolice.It’s now no longer a mystery how the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionepidemiologist died. Cunningham committed suicide by drowning himself, accordingto the Fulton County Medical Examiner’s office.12[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn3_12]Maybe.I just don’t buy it, though. Especially after what I lived through in 2011. Theevents were so similar it made my skin crawl. I shudder to think what might havehappened if we did not own baby Jonah, that thirteen-foot Boston Whaler. Andwhat about Bradstreet, found dead in a river, as well? Cunningham was wellliked, accomplished, had two degrees from Harvard, and was a commander in the USPublic Health Service, having responded to the Ebola and Zika outbreaks, as wellas Superstorm Sandy. I challenge you to look at a picture of this well-builtthirty-five-year-old African American man in his commander’s uniform, standingin front of an American flag and the flag of the US Public Health Service, andsee a brittle soul.Do you see how the Atlanta Journal-Constitution article muddies the waters?It’s like one of those horoscopes where they say so many things you think it’saccurate because one of them resonates with you.He didn’t know if he was gay or not! That’s why he killed himself?He didn’t get that promotion! That’s why he killed himself?He had a mysterious unnamed “chronic disease” for which he was takingmedication! That’s why he killed himself? Okay, what was that chronic disease?Psoriasis?I tend to think the answer resides in something vague reported in a WashingtonPost article a few weeks after Cunningham disappeared:Police investigators are bewildered as they work through the “extremely unusual”circumstances surrounding the missing-person case of Timothy Cunningham, aresearcher who vanished February 12, shortly after hearing why he had beenpassed over for a promotion at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC).Cunningham, 35, told colleagues he was not feeling well and left work at CDCheadquarters in Atlanta, not long after speaking with his supervisor about whyhad not been promoted, Atlanta Police Maj. Michael O’Connor told reporters.13[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn3_13]I’d like to know the reason Cunningham was passed over for that promotion.Was it because he was saying flu shots were killing people?That might get you passed over for a promotion in public health if it turns outyou’re killing members of the public and talking about it to nosey reporters.image [../Images/common.jpg]How far will our government go to attack members of what it perceives to be itsdomestic opposition? In other words, what measures will the United Statesgovernment employ against its own citizens? This isn’t a question of one partyagainst another. It’s a question of power.I tend to think that looking at the past can help us answer such questions.If somebody stepped over a line, we expect that the person will be punished.If it was part of a standard operating procedure, we can expect that theidentity of such persons will remain hidden, even if the crimes are exposed.On November 21, 1964, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) sent a letter tocivil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., urging him to kill himself, alongwith a tape recording of his alleged sexual encounters with women. King wassupposed to be traveling in a few weeks to Sweden to accept the Nobel PeacePrize for his work aimed at ending segregation.In 2014, the New York Times printed a nearly unedited copy of that letter. Theleadership of the FBI apparently wanted King to believe it came from a fellowAfrican American.KING,In view of your low grade, abnormal personal behavior I will not dignify yourname with either a Mr. or a Reverend or a Dr. And, your last name calls to mindonly the type of King such as Henry VIII and his countless acts of adultery andimmoral conduct lower than that of a beast.King, look into your heart. You know you are a complete fraud and greatliability to all of us Negroes. White people in this country have enough friendsof their own but I am sure they don’t have one at this time that is any whereyour equal. You are no clergyman and you know it. I repeat you are a colossalfraud and an evil, vicious one at that. You could not believe in God and act asyou do. Clearly, you don’t believe in any personal moral principles.The next three paragraphs spew hate and attack Dr. King’s character andChristian values, mocking his degrees and honors. Once again, this type ofdialogue is eerily similar to the kinds of things written about me. The removalof the Dr. from my name and my entire life’s work seemingly stolen as otherslike Coffin and Lipkin appeared to cash in on our discoveries by publishing ourdata and patents as their own. The FBI and other federal officials ostensiblyparticipated in all of this in an attempt to convince me to commit suicide inexchange for destroying my family and my honorable name. Am I surprised how theletter ends? Decide for yourself.King, there is only one thing left for you to do. You know what it is. You havejust 34 days in which to do (this exact number has been selected for a specificreason, it has definite practical significant.) You are done. There is but oneway out for you. You better take it before your filthy, abnormal fraudulent selfis barred to the nation.14 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn3_14]Does that letter sound as psychotic to you as it does to me? This is our FederalBureau of Investigation urging the country’s most prominent civil rights leaderto kill himself prior to accepting the Nobel Peace Prize.In fairness, it must be noted that Dr. King did not lead an exemplary personallife.Neither did President John F. Kennedy, or President Lyndon Johnson, who followedhim.But the FBI never sent letters to Kennedy or Johnson urging them to commitsuicide.I know many will see that letter from the FBI to Dr. King solely through theprism of race relations in the 1960s. I think it’s about something even larger.If the use of this tactic was an aberration, then I’d expect that the person whowrote this letter would have been identified, stripped of his job and pension,and criminally charged.Nothing like that even remotely happened.The author of this hideous letter was allowed to recede into obscurity withoutpenalty, just as to this day no one has ever paid for the crimes committedagainst me or this patient population. In fact, they are awarded with tens ofmillions of dollars in federal grants.It’s a larger question than racism or the corruption of science. It’s thequestion of who’s allowed to have a voice. Who is permitted to participate inthe conversation?Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated on April 4, 1968, in Memphis,Tennessee. I remember the day, as it was only days after my tenth birthday. Iremember wondering what it was like for King in those final months, as mygrandfather said he knew that bullet was coming for him. He’d seen the shadow ofits trajectory during his marches and rallies, as he sat in Southern jails, andwhen that letter arrived from the FBI along with the tape recording.Soon they would come for him.It was only a matter of time.And yet he persisted.We must do the same."},{"pageContent":"images [../Images/line.jpg]CHAPTER FOURThe Fate of Those Who Fight the Darknessimages [../Images/line.jpg]As my attorney, Mike Hugo, tells it, he first heard about me when he got a callfrom an attorney in Southern California with whom I’d discussed the case.The attorney said, “Hey, Mike, I’ve got this case. It’s probably the hardestyou’ve ever seen. And I don’t know if the case is hard because the client is soemotional and tortured by the factual circumstances that she has troublearticulating herself or what. She’s really brilliant. But what happened to heris so off the wall that the first person I thought of was you. Because you likeoff-the-wall stuff.”“Okay,” said Mike, finding himself intrigued by that opening. The other attorneylaid out what he knew of the case, my background, how I was arrested and jailedfor five days without an arrest warrant, then let go as if by magic when myformer boss, a wealthy political donor to US Senator Harry Reid, told the policeto let me go.Mike got all the facts he could from this lawyer and then gave me a call. Wetalked for hours. I can be like that. Sorry, Mike.Our book PLAGUE was in galleys, so I sent him a PDF copy. I also sent him a copyof the 42 USC 1983 complaint I’d filed Pro Se (on my own behalf, from the Latin)with the court. I hadn’t been able to find an attorney prior to filing thecomplaint, but a few of my friends who were attorneys gave me some generalguidance. The problem was they weren’t trial attorneys, and the facts of my casewere rather unusual.Mike found the complaint to be poorly drafted and confusing. I agreed. I was ascientist, not a lawyer. We were facing a motion to dismiss my complaint, andMike did a wonderful job in front of that judge.As Mike later explained, “A poorly drafted complaint usually has a lot of factsin it. If you write a good complaint, it should come down to three pages.”When Mike appeared in front of the judge, he simply laid it all out on the line.“I’m totally confused. I’m asking the court not to ask me any questions todayand let me redraft the complaint. I need to talk to my client and figure outwhat this case is really all about.”The judge seemed relieved by Mike’s candor and granted him the time he needed toamend my complaint.image [../Images/common.jpg]There’s probably no better attorney in the entire world to understand whathappened in my case than Mike Hugo.Mike got his undergraduate degree from Boston College in 1975, then graduatedmagna cum laude from New England Law School in 1983. His first few cases out oflaw school involved vaccines, specifically the old DPT(diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus) shot, which was eventually removed from themarket because of so many bad reactions. Within a year of doing that first case,he had more than a hundred vaccine cases and at one point was handling somewherearound five hundred DPT injury cases. At the time, he was also developing apractice based around women who were alleging health problems from theirsilicone breast implants.An attorney friend of Mike’s was doing an environmental case and suing two largecompanies, W. R. Grace and Beatrice Foods. It would come to be known as theWoburn case, eventually resulting in one of the largest environmental fines everlevied against a corporation. The companies were trying to spend that attorneyinto the ground, and Mike realized that he could use the positive cash flow hewas getting from his vaccine injury and breast implant cases to help thatattorney.That attorney was Jan Schlichtmann, portrayed in the 1998 movie A Civil Actionby John Travolta, and in the popular book of the same name. Jan has famouslysaid, “John Travolta made more money playing me than I ever did playing me.”1[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn4_1]That’s something of an understatement.At one time Schlichtmann had $114 in his bank account and a million dollars ofdebt. Mental breakdowns are common among those who try to change the world. Janwas no different, eventually fleeing Boston after the loss of the Woburn case toHawaii and living in the crater of Haleakala, where he began sellingenergy-efficient light bulbs.2 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn4_2] It was only afterJan’s loss in the Woburn case that the federal government would conduct athorough investigation of the claims, leading to the record fines.During the years Jan was preparing the Woburn case, he was able to do it becauseMike was bringing in money with his vaccine injury and breast implant cases. TheWoburn case left Mike with many financial obligations, some of which continue tothis day.image [../Images/common.jpg]The vaccine injury cases were lucrative to Mike’s practice, but exhausting.These were in the days before the passage of the 1986 National Childhood VaccineInjury Act that would change everything. Mike said there were about eightattorneys around the country who were handling these cases and they wouldregularly get together to meet and discuss strategies and tactics. Their mainexperts were Dr. Kevin Geraghty, a physician from Northern California who hadcompleted fellowships in allergy and immunology at the University of Chicago andthe University of California, San Francisco; Dr. Arthur Zahalsky, who taught atCity University of New York and was chair of the Department of BiologicalSciences at Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville; and Dr. Mark Geier, whohad been an obstetric geneticist at the National Institutes of Health.As Mike recalled, “We’d sit and compare notes about our cases, what theirexperts were saying, and prepare one another for what we were going to do. Thatevolved into analyzing one another’s cases and offering help. Expert witnesseswe had, that the other guy might not. Because we were all in it together. We allneeded to win. We couldn’t afford a loss because we needed to show how bad thisvaccine was.”The vaccine litigation was vicious and exposed Mike to a level of bad behaviorthat he hadn’t believed was possible. The worst was a cluster of eleven suddeninfant deaths in Tennessee due to the DPT vaccine manufactured by WyethLaboratories. The truth was uncovered by a state medical examiner who asked theright questions in the medical histories of the eleven infants who died.In discovery, Mike uncovered an August 27, 1979, memo from Wyeth, which was sentby the company’s head of vaccines, a Dr. Alan Bernstein. While the number ofdeaths caused by this vaccine was shocking, the number of brain-damaged childrenwas even higher. Those were the cases Mike was handling in the early 1980s.The memo started out with the acknowledgment the vaccine might kill a certainnumber of children, which was why they decided that no more than two thousanddoses of the drug would go to any metropolitan area, thus avoiding the situationwhere many children would die in a small geographic area in a short period oftime.3 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn4_3] This way you might get one or two infantsdying in Boston, one or two in New York, a few in Philadelphia, a few inNashville, but not enough in any single area to cause a panic. Babies would die,or be grievously injured, but to their parents and the local health authorities,what happened would remain a mystery.At least, that’s the way Mike Hugo interpreted it.When Mike deposed Dr. Bernstein, he went after him with a vengeance. “I ran thisguy over the rocks as hard as I possibly could. I blamed deaths on himpersonally. I said there was blood on his hands, not on Wyeth’s. I could nothave been a bigger asshole. The next morning his lawyer tells me, ‘Dr. Bernsteinwas in the hospital all night with chest pains. I hope you’re satisfied.’ Ireplied, ‘I hope Dr. Bernstein is satisfied that watching your child go fromnormal to brain-damaged or dead is more painful than a heart attack.’”The pace was exhausting. Mike would often fly out of Boston on a Sunday night toa variety of different cities—New York, Dallas, Chicago, Los Angeles—then flyback to Boston on a Friday night, rest up for a day and a half, then get readyto do it all over again. One night he found himself awake on the floor of aMarriott Hotel room in Salt Lake City where he was staying for a week for adeposition, crying because he didn’t know where he was or why. He had to crawlover to look at the address listed on the room phone to realize where he was.“What the hell am I doing in Salt Lake City?” he thought, before he realizedhe’d already been there for two days of depositions and had three more to go.Mike had all these cases going on across the country when he got a call from alawyer in Washington, DC, whose child had been brain-damaged by the DPT vaccine.He said he’d been through the litigation process and they’d won, but it had beentoo difficult.Something else needed to be done.Vaccine cases were taking about six years to judgment at that time, costingabout a hundred and fifty thousand to prepare. Mike recalled, “You get to thepoint that you know enough to make the decision yourself. You don’t need tospend twenty-five thousand dollars on a pediatric neurologist and a geneticist.If the child was born normally, everything was on target, and all the milestoneswere made and suddenly you’ve had a loss of function within twenty-four hours ofa DPT shot, I know enough to file a lawsuit. But once you file the lawsuit,you’ve got to take all the depositions. You have to analyze all the records. Youhave to know there’s something peculiar about one of the records. You have tostay in hotels where sometimes you wake up in cold sweats on the floor. And itcosts money to do that.”But often the injury wasn’t immediately apparent within twenty-four hours. Yes,there could be death, there could be paralysis where your kid was suddenly aspastic quadriplegic, but other injuries were subtler. “In some cases, the kidsare going to school and the teachers are having a conference with the parent andsay, ‘Your kid is not doing what the other kids are doing.’ And in 99 percent ofthe cases the parents break down in tears because they knew it all along butdidn’t want to face it. But now a teacher is telling them and now they have todo something. And that’s when they call a lawyer like me.”The lawyer in Washington, DC, was talking to some people in Congress about howto create a more efficient and less painful system to get compensation to theparents of vaccine-injured children and wanted to get Mike’s support. Mikethought that any change to the system would be an improvement.Mike spent hundreds of hours working with the office of Congressman Henry Waxmanand his legislative aide, Tim Westmoreland, trying to craft a worthwhile pieceof legislation. He is unsatisfied with what has happened with that law.“There has to be an out,” says Mike, speaking of the 1986 National ChildhoodVaccine Injury Act. “If parents are willing to go through the process of provingthe product was defective, you have to allow them to do that. They have to beable to get a ruling in 240 days or they can opt out. The law was supposed toget those parents a ruling in 240 days, so they could get back to taking care oftheir injured child. Now it takes three or four years and we’re back to where westarted. It’s a crazy system. It has to change.”image [../Images/common.jpg]Mike’s years as a plaintiff’s attorney have also opened his eyes to anotherunsettling development of which I venture to say most of the public is unaware:corporate surveillance.In one of his cases he was representing clients from Arkansas in an opioid case.His clients lived on a five thousand-acre farm, and their home was at theintersection of two roads. On one corner was the client’s house, mom and dadlived in a house across the street, on another corner was the barn, and on theother corner was a big garage where they kept their tractors.Imagine this rural Arkansas town, then picture a black Ford Crown Vic stationedat the intersection, just sitting there for days on end. When the client phonedMike and told him about the car, Mike immediately knew who it is was.Mike called counsel for the other side to poke fun at the surveillance. “Atleast have your guy rent a tractor and go to Sears to buy a bunch of wrenches.He could pretend to be fixing his tractor. He’d blend in a lot better than a guyin a Crown Vic.”“We can legally follow anybody we want,” the lawyer brusquely replied. “We couldeven follow you.”“Yeah, if you could catch up to me,” Mike joked back.A few days later, Mike needed to drive from Boston to Portland, Maine, for adeposition. Another one of the lawyers was handling a case where a child haddrowned in a swimming pool at a resort in Maine. He asked if Mike wouldn’t mindgoing to the resort and taking a few pictures of the pool and access points.Mike said he would go.Before leaving his house that day, Mike had filled up his BMW X-5, a sportsutility vehicle with a thirty-gallon tank that gave him about afive-hundred-mile driving range. He’d been driving along Interstate 95, a majorroad, when he noticed what he thought was a Chevy Escalade. It had an unusualarch from the cab to the bed, and he thought it looked sharp. He paid the tollon the highway to get into New Hampshire and noticed the truck is behind him,and the same thing when he paid the toll to go into Maine.Mike decided to speed up to see if the Escalade would follow, even as heapproached a hundred miles an hour on a desolate stretch of road.The Escalade followed.Then Mike decided to slow way down to about thirty miles an hour.Still, the Escalade stayed behind him.“Okay, I know what’s going on,” Mike said to himself. “Let’s have some fun.”Mike sped past Portland on his way to the resort where he needed to takepictures, and the Escalade followed. Mike took his pictures, then got back intohis car. He’d grown up in this area of Maine and had a couple hours before hisdeposition. He also knew a good fifty-mile stretch of road without any gasstations and figured the henchman must be running low on gasoline.Mike headed northwest on a desolate stretch of road, and sure enough theEscalade ran out of gas. Mike watched in delight as the driver pulled onto theshoulder of the road. Eventually Mike turned around, so he could pass thestranded driver. As he drove slowly past, he flashed the guy a big shit-eatinggrin, honked his horn, and gave the guy the middle finger.This was when cell phones were relatively uncommon. Mike had one, but he didn’tknow if the surveillance guy did. Mike called the attorney in California andsaid, “Your guy couldn’t keep up with me. He ran out of gas.” Mike gave theattorney the approximate location and said, “You might want to send a towtruck.”There were other incidents, less terrifying maybe than having a car on yourbumper as you’re barreling down a highway at a hundred miles an hour, but noless disturbing.Traveling across the country and taking depositions is a lonely life, and asattorneys are for all practical purposes warriors in the cause of their clients,there’s often a mutual respect that develops between the combatants. You mayfight during the day in a deposition with all your brains and skill, but atnight you’re just a couple guys stuck in a hotel far from family and friends.In a case against a manufacturer of Rezulin, a diabetes drug, which was causingkidney and liver failure, Mike was getting ready to do a deposition, and thelawyer for the other side asked where he was staying. Mike replied he was aMarriott guy, so he’d be staying at one of their local hotels.The attorney replied, “We’re all staying at the Chesterbrook Embassy Suites. Whydon’t you stay there? When the day’s over we can have a drink, maybe dinner, andgo over the day?”Mike thought, “What the hell? Who could be hurt by that?”One night, as he was in the middle of a week of depositions, he was talking withone of his partners about a series of studies that he planned to bring up in thenext day’s examination. However, during the next day’s deposition, the witnessseemed to be too familiar with the studies he was bringing up.Mike called for a break, then went to his hotel room. He went to the phone,unscrewed the mouthpiece, and saw that there was a listening device in thereceiver. He took pictures, replaced the mouthpiece, and checked out of thehotel.A few weeks later, Mike got a call from one of his fellow vaccine lawyers whoalso had a case against Wyeth. The attorney was asking Mike if he had a certaindocument that might help in his case.“Where are you staying?” Mike asked.“Embassy Suites,” the attorney replied.“Let me take the mystery out of it,” said Mike. “You’re staying in Room 585.”“Yeah, how did you know?”“Hang up the phone and call me from an outside pay phone and I’ll tell you.”Now, some people may think this is something that remains in the bad old days ofthe past, but Mike claims he continues to hear stories like this from attorneysworking today. One of his friends, who was pursuing a case against GeneralMotors, claims the General Motors attorneys were listening to his conversationsthrough the On-Star system.Kent is deeply disturbed by these allegations, seeing this surveillance as akinto the mafia listening in on the federal government with impunity. The public isbeing harmed because these corporations are acting in an extrajudicial fashionnever envisioned by the framers of our judicial system.Mike sees the situation differently: “I think their goal is to protect theircorporation from that first Vioxx verdict, which was $242 million dollars. Orthat first breast implant verdict, which was forty something million dollars.Because they must do everything they can to protect their investments. I’m notsure the goal of the surveillance is to undermine public health and safety. It’sto undermine the lawsuit you want to bring and taking their money. We’re talkingserious money. You can pick up the newspaper and read about the recent sixbillion-dollar settlement with Johnson and Johnson for asbestos in baby powdertalc. That’s one you can watch right now. They must defend their money. If youask them, there’s nothing wrong with what they’re doing. They’re protectingtheir investors, their investment, their board, and that’s what it’s about.”I’ll let you come to your own conclusion, but it seems like these are the twosides in a critical debate about which we all need to have an opinion.image [../Images/common.jpg]One of the most surprising things about Mike Hugo is how he can see the flaws ofhis own side, as well as those of the corporations with which he often findshimself in dispute.Probably the greatest challenge a products liability lawyer has in bringing anew case is something called the Daubert standard. In theory, it all makessense. The legal system wants to ensure good science is presented in thecourtroom. Lawyers are not scientists. However, there is much more moneyprovided by corporations to scientists wanting to show the safety of theirproducts rather than their danger. I don’t think there’s a single person who canreasonably dispute that claim.If you are making a new claim regarding the danger of a product, you need to besure you have some solid science. Because once a decision is made under theDaubert standard, it may be several years until a court will let you reopen theissue. There you are, as the attorney with these clients who believe a certainproduct harmed them, and you also believe it to be true based on the evidenceyou’ve reviewed but worry about being able to prove it in court. There are morescientists with their hands out to do research for corporations than scientistswho will dig into their own pockets to fund safety research.You need to wait until the science is extremely strong, and if you don’t, you’regoing to screw things up for other people for years to come.At one point, Mike represented eighteen hundred women who had health problemsrelated to their silicone gel breast implants. The science was strong on thedevelopment of health problems if their breast implants leaked. But Mike wasalso finding serious health problems in women whose breast implants had notleaked. There were autoimmune issues like Reynaud’s Syndrome, lupus, and seriousskin conditions where the tissue was attacked and hardened, and you might loseall the skin on your body.“I had one videotape sent to me by a woman, and they actually had her on a bedwith all these misters like you have in a garden because she literally had noskin on her body,” Mike recalled. “She didn’t have any eyelids. She had no skinon her body. And they grafted a hundred percent of her body and she survived. Itwas like a miracle. And that was from silicone.”However, there was a lawyer from Portland who wanted to bring a case that thesilicone gel breast implants were causing disease, even though they weren’tleaking. Unfortunately, the science wasn’t ready. It was close, but not thereyet. Several researchers were doing great preliminary work and were probablyabout six to eight months from being able to publish in a top journal like TheLancet. But this lawyer wouldn’t be dissuaded.He brought his action and lost, screwing up all those breast implant cases.For many years after that, if anybody wanted to win a silicone gel breastimplant case, they had to allege that there must have been a leak of thematerial, even if there was no evidence to support it.The same lawyer came to Boston a few years later to talk with Mike. He said,“I’ve got another theory on a different piece of litigation, and I need yourbuy-in on it.”“What is it?” Mike asked.“Vaccines cause autism.”“You’re not going to try to prove it in those terms, are you?”The lawyer said, “Yeah, I think it causes autism and we’re going to prove it.We’ve got this guy from England who’s going to testify, and we’ve got a ton ofinformation.”Mike knew the lawyer was talking about Dr. Andrew Wakefield and his research onthe MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine and the development of gastrointestinalproblems, as well as autism.“Yeah, you’re right. Vaccines do cause autism,” Mike replied. “But you can’t gointo court and prove that for two reasons. First, the government will neverallow that to happen. And number two, the science isn’t there yet. I know aboutWakefield. All his work describes to me is a postpertussis vaccineencephalopathy, which is compensable under the vaccine program. So, talk aboutit as an encephalopathy, which is the same fucking thing. But just don’t usethat word, ‘autism.’ Never say the A word. Never do it. Never do it.”“No, you don’t understand,” the lawyer protested.Mike’s emotions were at a fever pitch. “No, you don’t understand! You fucked upbreast implant litigation, and now you’re going to fuck this up!”But of course, the lawyer didn’t listen to Mike and the vaccine-autism caseswere lost in the Vaccine Court.I understand Mike’s point of view and even have some degree of sympathy for it.He’s trying to get the best result for his clients in a corrupt system.However, when a person stands and swears an oath in court, he promises to tell“the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.” There’s no provisionfor “I’ll tell as much of the truth as I can get you to believe.”image [../Images/common.jpg]And speaking of failure, let’s talk about my inability to get even a single dayin court for the violation of my civil rights for my false arrest, imprisonment,and how after more than seven years I still don’t have any copies of mynotebooks, or those of my research team, for the nearly five years I worked onME/CFS and retroviruses, or in fact for my entire research career.All of my work was in my two offices at the University of Nevada, Reno campusthat was locked down to me and my staff on September 29, 2011. I don’t even havea copy of my doctoral thesis on HIV!I’m an American scientist, for God’s sake! Give me my constitutional rights andmy data!Mike has a wonderful perspective on this issue, and his story leads back to FortDetrick, Maryland, and one of my early jobs in science, working as a youngprotein chemist purifying interferon in the Fermentation Chemistry lab and doingimmune therapy for cancer and AIDS at the Biological Response Modifiers programwith Frank Ruscetti in the early 1980s.The government doesn’t like to talk about the fact that in the past they’ve hada very robust development program for biological and chemical weapons. However,in November of 1969, President Nixon gave a speech in which he announced an endto the American program of offensive biological weapons and reaffirmed ano-first-use policy on chemical weapons.4 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn4_4] Theshort document, barely more than a page, is very illuminating. On biologicalweapons, the section reads:Biological weapons have massive, unpredictable, and potentially uncontrollableconsequences. They may produce global epidemics and impair the health of futuregenerations. I have therefore decided:-The United States shall renounce the use of lethal biological agents andweapons and all other methods of biological warfare.-The United States will confine its biological research to defensive measuressuch as immunization and safety measures.-The Department of Defense has been asked to make recommendations as to theexisting stocks of bacteriological weapons.5 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn4_5]On the issue of chemical weapons, the mandate was a little less clear. Were westopping our research, or just putting a little fancy window dressing on thecontroversy?You decide:As to our chemical warfare program, the United States:-Reaffirms its oft-repeated renunciation of the first use of lethal chemicalweapons.-Extends this renunciation to the first use of incapacitating chemicals.Consonant with these decisions, the Administration will submit to the Senate,for its advice and consent to ratification, the Geneva Protocol of 1925 whichprevents the first use in war of “asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases and ofbacteriological methods of warfare.” The United States has long supported theprinciples and objectives of this Protocol. We take this step toward formalratification to reinforce our continuing advocacy of international constraintson the use of these weapons.6 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn4_6]Did you catch what was really in that statement?The Geneva Protocol of 1925 banned the first use of chemical and biologicalagents in warfare. Nixon was finally submitting this protocol to the Senate in1969. That’s a span of forty-four years, taking in the Depression, World War II,the Korean War, the Kennedy assassination, and a good chunk of the Vietnam War.During the Korean War there were claims by the North Koreans that we usedbiological warfare against their troops. Did Nixon’s statement deny that theUnited States had ever used such tactics? And his statement still left open theuse of deadly herbicides like Agent Orange, of which we dropped massive amountsin Vietnam.Was Nixon declaring the United States was banning research into chemical andbiological weapons so that the world could rest easy that such threats wouldnever come from the United States? Or was there a loophole, which would allowthese programs to proceed?Neither our association with the Convention nor the limiting of our program toresearch will leave us vulnerable to surprise by an enemy who does not observethese rational restraints. Our intelligence community will continue to watchcarefully the nature and the extent of the biological programs of others.These important decisions, which have been announced today, have been taken asan initiative toward peace. Mankind already carries in its own hands too many ofthe seeds of its own destruction. By the example we set today, we hope tocontribute to an atmosphere of peace and understanding between nations and amongmen.7 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn4_7]As I read the statement, it seems to be business as usual. This publicacknowledgment, however, was important, and I genuinely believed it was a firststep to a better future.One needs to tell the truth before a solution can be found.Fort Detrick was changed from a chemical and biological weapons research lab toa cancer research lab. A decade later, Frank Ruscetti and I came on the scene.We were never hired to figure out ways to end life. We were hired to learn howto save lives. Yes, I know the same knowledge can be used in both pursuits.But Frank and I have always been about protecting life.However, Fort Detrick couldn’t quite escape its past as a chemical andbiological weapons lab. I mean, where were they supposed to store all thesebiological and chemical agents? Fort Detrick became the main storage facilityfor these programs. And in fact, the army used the area around Fort Detrick totest aerial concentrations of Agent Orange, using helicopters and airplanes.As Mike later explained, Fort Detrick had all the terrible chemicals he’dencountered in the Woburn case, as well as biological agents. It was a chemicaland biological waste dump.image [../Images/common.jpg]Mike came to learn about Fort Detrick because of a case he brought for a mannamed Randy White, a famous televangelist preacher whose congregation was called“The Church Without Walls.”8 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn4_8] Randy lived next toFort Detrick. His wife and daughter both came down with cancer and died, whichRandy blamed on toxins from the base. His website notes his founding of theKristen Renee Foundation in memory of his daughter, as well as the Fighting forFrederick project, which is “initiating effective governmental legislationsurrounding chemical contaminants and the effect on our population andwildlife.” During the Bill Clinton presidency, Randy served as an “officialcounsel” to the president and was granted top-secret clearance with the USgovernment and State Department.When Mike looked at a map documenting cancer deaths around Fort Detrick, itlooked extremely disturbing: “This map had a black dot for every house in whichthere was a cancer death. The map was almost black. There were houses where mom,dad, and all three kids died of cancer.”It was difficult bringing the suit in an area with a very promilitary mindset.But to Mike it wasn’t a question of being pro- or antimilitary.In fact, most of his clients were ex-military or military families because ofthe common practice in the South that veterans often like to settle near wherethey served and had some of the best times of their lives.There was another similar case working through the courts, in which a realestate developer found that he couldn’t build houses on land he bought becauseof the contamination.The judge hearing the case was a Republican appointee, and Mike thought it mightresult in a favorable outcome, considering that in a fight between a businessmanand the government, the conservative judge would rule in favor of thebusinessman. However, the judge ruled in favor of the government.The only additional piece of information Mike had that he thought might behelpful was Nixon’s 1969 executive order. As Mike later recalled, “The firstthing this judge asked me about the executive order was ‘How much of thisinformation you’re showing me is public information?’ I said, ‘I’ve gleaned itall from publicly available documents because I haven’t yet been allowed toconduct meaningful discovery.’ And he asked, ‘Do you have any doubt that thereis some value to chemical and biological warfare weapons?’ And I said, ‘I havenothing but doubt that there is value to chemical and biological warfare weaponsthat are deployed in such a way as to weaponize mosquitoes with things likeanthrax, which would enable them to bite children along with soldiers.’ Therewas a complete disconnect with that judge, and the case got thrown out.”Mike even called in the well-known environmental activist Erin Brockovich tolead a sit-in at the courthouse, but it did no good. Yes, that Erin Brockovich,played in the movie by Julia Roberts. Environmental activists are good roles foractors who want to get nominated for awards. But that doesn’t make the job anyeasier for the real people on the front lines.The case made it all the way to the Supreme Court in 2018, where it was alsodenied.9 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn4_9]image [../Images/common.jpg]Mike Hugo thinks the reason I haven’t been able to get my case inside acourtroom is similar to why those claimants from Fort Detrick have not been ableto get their claims heard. “Things happened in Judy’s case which suggested to methat they couldn’t be happening unless there was somebody very high up in thechain of command somewhere pulling the strings to obfuscate what this case wasreally about,” he told Kent.And what is my case about?I think it’s about the use of animal tissues to grow viruses for vaccines, or touse in the development of other biological products, transferring those animalviruses into human beings where they are causing a cascade of human diseases,from autism to ME/CFS, cancer, and the new diseases of aging like Alzheimer’sdisease when the functions of the immune system begin to falter.We thought we knew what we were doing in those labs, but we didn’t.All of humanity is at risk, especially the lab workers.image [../Images/common.jpg]Has Mike Hugo paid the price for his advocacy?The evidence suggests he has.Let’s go down the list of cases he’s handled. He’s gone after corporatepolluters, vaccine makers, pharmaceutical companies, and Fort Detrick. He’s alsosued the US government for something called Project Columbia, where ourgovernment sprayed glyphosate on opium fields in Columbia, only to have some ofthe material drift into Ecuador and destroy farms and people’s health in thatcountry.In my case, he found himself on the opposite side of former US Senate MajorityLeader Harry Reid, because my former boss, Harvey Whittemore, was his biggestdonor. (It was at least some measure of justice that Harvey Whittemore waseventually charged and convicted of federal election crimes related to SenatorReid and sentenced to fourteen months in prison.)So, it probably wasn’t just handling my case that got Mike into trouble. He’dbeen getting himself into trouble long before he’d met me.But my case probably didn’t help.In the last years of his life, Mike’s father needed money. The recession of 2008had hit, and after his mother died in 1983, he married a woman who blew throughtwo and a half million dollars of his father’s money. For the last few years ofhis life, whenever Mike’s father needed money, he’d call Mike, and Mike wouldsend him a check. By the time Mike’s father died, the amount Mike had given tohis father was about a hundred and eighty thousand dollars. The two of them hadtreated the money as a loan, and Mike’s father even signed over a few of hislife insurance policies to him.However, when Mike’s father died, there was a problem with Mike’s sister. She’dbeen estranged from their father since their mother died. She decided to sueMike and report him to the bar, claiming there’d never been any such financialagreement between Mike and their father. Yes, Mike should have had a writtennote with his father, but he didn’t.Mike hired an attorney to defend him, and the attorney thought the case wouldtake two years and probably cost a hundred and fifty thousand to defend. Andbesides, since there was no written note, they’d likely lose. The attorneythought the worst the bar would do was write and publish a letter of censure ofMike, embarrassing him in front of the legal community, or maybe a suspensionfor a year.But the bar came back saying they wanted to disbar him. Mike’s wife was in themiddle of her reelection campaign for a local office, and Mike said he’d acceptthe disbarment if it came after his wife’s election. The bar agreed, his wifewon reelection to her office, and Mike accepted disbarment. He was getting closeto retirement age, anyway.Mike had some friends high up in state government and thought he’d do a littleinvestigating as to why the bar had been so severe with him. A highly placedelected state official told Mike, “If you were writing wills or recording titlesand deeds, or defending petty larceny cases, you wouldn’t be in this trouble.But the bar knows you’re a high-profile lawyer with cases across the country,and they’re using you as an example. You’ve taken on the high and mighty. Andthey want to show people you don’t get to take on the high and mighty unlessyou’re squeaky clean.”image [../Images/common.jpg]Is that how it ends?The bad guys keep me out of a courtroom and make it so Mike can never handleanother legal case?I think life has more twists and turns of fate than we might imagine.Mike may have had to surrender his law license, but Harvard University camecalling for his expertise. He’s now giving seminars on the opioid epidemic,urging treatment rather than punishment for addicts.Mike’s wife continues her political career.And Mike’s daughter, Carly Hugo, is making quite a name for herself in the filmindustry. She recently had her tenth film premiere at the Sundance FilmFestival. Her latest film, Share, an eleven-minute short, won three awards atthe 2019 Sundance Film Festival. The screenwriter won the Waldo SaltScreenwriting Award, the actress won the US Dramatic Special Jury Award forAchievement in Acting, and Carly and her coproducer won the 2019 SundanceInstitute/Amazon Studios Producer Award for their body of work over the past tenyears.It’s currently being turned into a feature film for HBO.She’s also working on a legal drama about the explosion at an oil refinery inTexas City, Texas, hoping to make it the next A Civil Action or Erin Brockovich.What’s the fate of those who fight the darkness?Maybe it’s brighter than we think.We just need to keep fighting."},{"pageContent":"images [../Images/line.jpg]CHAPTER FIVEIs the Government a Friend or Foe?images [../Images/line.jpg]The government was alarmed by our research.And after they screwed up the last serious retrovirus, HIV, and destroyed publicconfidence, they didn’t want to make the same mistake with XMRV.And how badly did the government screw up the HIV-AIDS epidemic?At first, they said it was a disease that could only be contracted bypromiscuous gay men, prostitutes, and intravenous drug users. You know, theoriginal “deplorables.”But if you were a child or straight, you didn’t have to worry.Let those other people deal with the disease their lifestyle has brought uponthem.Then a child, Ryan White, got HIV-AIDS from a blood transfusion and suddenlyevery parent in America was thinking about that all-too-common trip to thehospital they take when their kids do something stupid like trying to jump offthe roof or skateboard down that big hill.And what about Arthur Ashe, the gentlemanly African American tennis star andWimbledon champion, who went in for heart surgery and came out with an HIVinfection, later dying of the disease?The CDC had made terrible mistakes during the HIV-AIDS epidemic, gyrating fromone extreme to the other. They say truth is the first casualty of war, and thatwas no less true in the fight against HIV-AIDS.I isolated infectious HIV from saliva at the time people were being told oralsex was “safe sex.” If my research had been published during the early days ofthe epidemic, I’m sure it would’ve been used to justify shunning those with thedisease. But I was just a lowly lab technician at a time when technicians werenot permitted to coauthor scientific papers.As it was, my thesis research was published in the later days, as many weretrying to make amends for their earlier mistakes, and it didn’t fit with thenarrative. My maddening frustration stems from the fact that my job as ascientist is to find out the truth and publish it.And once we know what the problem is, we get to work on finding an answer.How bad were things with HIV and the blood supply?Let me do a little review for you.image [../Images/common.jpg]A 2003 article in the New York Times stated it in very clear terms. Bayer hadsold millions of dollars of a blood-clotting medicine to hemophiliacs in Asiaand Latin America in the mid-1980s contaminated with the AIDS virus, whileselling a safer version in the West:“These are the most incriminating internal pharmaceutical documents I have everseen,” said Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, who as director of the Public Citizen HealthResearch Group has been investigating the industry’s practices for threedecades. . .In the United States, AIDS was passed on to thousands of hemophiliacs, many ofwhom died, in one of the worst drug-related medical disasters in history. Whileadmitting no wrongdoing, Bayer and three other companies that made theconcentrate have paid hemophiliacs about $600 million to settle more than 15years of lawsuits accusing them of making a dangerous product.1[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn5_1]Think about the timeline from the act until there had been some publicdisclosure. Nearly two decades. That is not swift justice by anybody’sreckoning.And as the article points out, there had been fifteen years of lawsuits andsomewhere around six hundred million dollars paid to victims.Having become more familiar with corporate tactics over the past few years, wecan only assume the reason we don’t have a more accurate number for the amountpaid out to victims is because of nondisclosure agreements, which are common inthese kinds of cases.In England it took more than three decades for the British government to issuean apology for failing to protect the blood supply in the mid-1980s. It was onlyin September of 2018 that the British government spoke openly about theirfailure to act and conduct a public investigation of the issue as reported bythe BBC:The government has apologized for the infected blood scandal at the publicinquiry into how thousands of people became infected with HIV and hepatitis.The government’s legal team said it was clear “things happened that should nothave happened.”It has been called the worst NHS treatment disaster.Speaking on behalf of the Department of Health and Social Care in England andits predecessor which covered the whole of the UK, Eleanor Grey QC said: “We aresorry. This happened when it should not have been done.”2[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn5_2]It didn’t have to be this way. Japan handled these cases much differently fromhow the United States or England did. They settled their HIV-tainted blood casesin 1996, as reported in the New York Times.Five drug companies and Japan’s Minister of Health and Welfare agreed today to aproposed settlement with hemophiliacs who were infected with the AIDS virusthrough contaminated blood-clotting products, setting the stage for the end ofseven years of bitter litigation.The case has roiled Japan because it seemed to show that the Government was moreinterested in shielding Japanese drug companies from foreign competition than inprotecting public health . . .Today, several top executives of the Green Cross Corporation, one of the drugmanufacturers, knelt on the floor in apology to a delegation of victims at thecompany’s Osaka headquarters. As the mother of one victim loudly berated them,the executives bowed until their heads touched the ground.3[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn5_3]I am haunted by the facts of the Japanese case. Maybe it’s only when we look atother countries that we can more clearly see the pattern of corruption in ourown.In any large-scale public health effort, it’s almost guaranteed that governmentand private industry will share responsibility. We cannot independently verifythe safety of medications. We expect there to be an extra level of protectionfrom the government.That was true in Japan, it was true in England, and it’s true in the UnitedStates.The classic book on the HIV-AIDS epidemic is Randy Shilts’s And the Band PlayedOn: People, Politics and the AIDS Epidemic, which was also turned into an EmmyAward-winning HBO film. While placing sizable portions of blame among manygroups, from politicians who didn’t want to talk about gays to leaders of thegay community who didn’t want to implement safe sex practices because theyviewed them as an infringement on their newly won sexual freedoms, Shilts alsoplaced a good deal of responsibility on those who oversaw the nation’s bloodsupply. In a review of Shilts’s book for the New York Times, the paper laid outthe issue of the blood supply catastrophe.The nation’s blood supply industry at first resisted suggestions that the AIDSvirus could be transmitted through blood transfusions, belittled the initialevidence that such transmission was occurring and refused to implement crudetesting procedures to screen out infected blood. This, Mr. Shilts says, waslargely because they did not want to shake public confidence in the bloodsupply, lose an important supply of blood from gay donors or pay for costlytesting. Only when evidence became overwhelming and a better screening test wasavailable did most blood banks take effective action.4[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn5_4]Even all these years later it’s difficult for me to read such sections withouthaving a visceral, emotional response. I was there, working for governmentscience at the time these beautiful young men were dying. I talked to them,looked into their eyes, and some were my friends. I held the hand of several asthey died and will forever miss their company.The AIDS corruption and lack of humanity on the part of so many groups wereeventually revealed for the entire world to see. It wasn’t just about thecorporations. The governments failed, as well.They did not want to be embarrassed again with XMRV.image [../Images/common.jpg]One of the biggest myths in public health is that articles submitted to journalsare “confidential” until release and the scientific establishment only learns ofthe newest findings at the same time as the public.The truth is that good ol’ boy scientists at the top gossip like a bunch of oldwomen if something interesting shows up for review at the journals. We submittedour paper on XMRV and ME/CFS on May 6, 2009, to the prestigious journal Science,and even though the paper would not be published until October 8, 2009, in thesummer of 2009 Frank and I found ourselves along with several other scientistsat an “Invitation Only” meeting to privately discuss the findings of our work.If findings are supposed to be “embargoed” until publication, how did all ofthis happen?The workshop of July 22, 2009, was titled “Public Health Implications of XMRVInfection, Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Center of Excellence in HIV/AIDS &Cancer Virology.”This is the abstract provided to the participants prior to our day-long meeting:Introduction—In 2006, the human retrovirus XMRV (xenotropic murine leukemiavirus-related virus) was identified and reported to be associated with certaincases of prostate cancer. Although the public health implications of thisfinding were not immediately clear, a series of presentations at the most recentCold Spring Harbor Laboratory meeting on retroviruses provided additionalsupport for this linkage and suggested that the number of individuals infectedwith XMRV is significant enough to be a cause for public concern. In view ofthese developments, it was deemed appropriate for NCI (National CancerInstitute) to convene a small group of intramural and extramural scientists andclinicians with expertise in this area to provide the NCI leadership withrecommendations on future directions.5 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn5_5]I just want to point out that nobody from my team presented at the Cold SpringsHarbor Laboratory meeting on retroviruses. As so often happens in science, thatmeant multiple groups, using similar new technology and new understandings, werebeing led to the same conclusion. Their work was preliminary and alarming, buthere we were showing up with a patient population, isolation of the virus,electron micrograph pictures of the virus, and multiple confirming assays. Frankand I were the most visible faces for this discovery, but only because we haddone the most work and made the most important discoveries for a quarter of acentury. Who else should have been the lead on this issue?I think it’s important to highlight the two organizers of this meeting, since itshows their involvement in this issue prior the publication of our paper to theworld. They were Dr. Stuart Le Grice, Head of the HIV Drug Resistance Program;and Dr. John Coffin, a professor at Tufts University, who also held an advisoryposition at the National Cancer Institute.Even from the start, I believe these two individuals were “stage-managing” thepotential public relations nightmare that was bearing down on the researchcommunity. It’s my opinion that these two men appointed themselves guardians ofthe issue, so that XMRV would not get out of hand and cause the people to loseconfidence, as had happened with HIV-AIDS.Also in attendance at the meeting were two researchers from Columbia University,two from the Cleveland Clinic, two from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research atthe University of Washington, and ten researchers from the National CancerInstitute.All of this was because of a paper that hadn’t even been published!One of the most important action items from the July 22, 2009, meeting was thatthe Center for Excellence for HIV/AIDS research, in collaboration with theNational Cancer Institute, authorized eight hundred thousand dollars to fund areagent study to develop a quick and economical PCR (polymerase chain reaction)test that would cost less than a dollar and could be used to test blood samplesprior to transfusion. They wanted to avoid the Ryan White and Arthur Ashescenarios, which had scandalized the scientific community during the HIV-AIDSepidemic. We were fortunate that Frank’s wife, Dr. Sandra Ruscetti, also alongtime researcher at the National Cancer Institute, was an expert on murineleukemia viruses (MLVs) and had a library of more than one hundred antibodiesshe’d developed over the years from this family of viruses.That summer of 2009 things seemed to be going well with XMRV and its detection.I received emails from Dr. Ilya Singh of the University of Utah, a participantat the July 22, 2009, meeting, indicating that she was finding the correctpositives in the blinded samples we were sending her.By the time our research was published in Science in October of 2009, thegovernment research community was hard at work on XMRV, trying to get right whatthey had gotten wrong in HIV-AIDS. In order to ensure we also had the highestlevel of political support for our general effort with this virus, my boss atthe Whittemore-Peterson Institute arranged for Frank Ruscetti to meet with themajority leader of the United States Senate, Harry Reid.After the meeting, Frank received a letter back from Senator Reid on his Senatestationery. The scientific details of what we were attempting would have beenbeyond the understanding of most politicians, and Frank recalled the senatorwanted most to know if this new discovery was “solid.” Frank assured him it was,based on his decades of work in the field of retrovirology, and it appeared toconvince the senator, because he penned what Frank and I often referred to asthe “don’t mess with us” letter.November 17, 2009Dr. Frank RuscettiHead, Leukocyte Biology SectionSenior InvestigatorNational Cancer InstituteLaboratory of Experimental immunologyThe National Cancer InstituteBuilding 567, Room 251Frederick, Maryland 21702Dear Dr. Ruscetti:Thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedule to meet with merecently.I appreciated the opportunity to learn more about the Whittemore-PetersonInstitute’s breakthrough discovery. I look forward to continuing to work withyou to ensure that work is being done at a federal level to support theadvancement of this important discovery.If I can be of any assistance to you in the future, please do not hesitate tocontact me.You have my best wishes.Sincerely,Harry ReidUnited States Senator6 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn5_6]Yes, it was a friendly little letter, but everybody knew what it meant. Themajority leader of the United States Senate supported our work, and with apresident of the same party in the Oval Office, Barack Obama, we felt confidentwe had the weight of the entire federal government behind us.Boy, were we wrong.image [../Images/common.jpg]Does our work with HIV and XMRV have any bearing on Alzheimer’s disease? Is theexplosion of Alzheimer’s disease likely to be the next big public healthscandal?Consider the following article, which was published in Medical News Today inNovember of 2018 with the intriguing title “Alzheimer’s May Soon Be Treated withHIV Drugs”:New research finds that an HIV enzyme plays a crucial role in drivingAlzheimer’s-related brain pathology by altering the APP gene. The findingswarrant “immediate clinical evaluation of HIV antiretroviral therapies in peoplewith Alzheimer’s disease,” say the authors of the study . . .Currently, 5.7 million people in the U.S. are living with the condition, and theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) predict the burden of thedisease will double by 2060 . . .The APP gene encodes a protein called amyloid precursor protein found in thebrain and spinal cord, among other tissues and organs. While the exact role ofthe APP protein is still unknown, scientists have found links between mutationsin this gene and the risk of early-onset Alzheimer’s cases . . .They found that the APP gene breeds new genetic variations within neuronsthrough a process of genetic recombination. Specifically, the process requiresreverse transcriptase, which is the same enzyme found in HIV . . .The researchers report that 100 percent of the brain samples that had theneurodegenerative condition also had a disproportionally high number ofdifferent APP genetic variations compared with healthy brains.7[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn5_7]I’m sure most of you followed that line of logic, but let me make sure it’scompletely clear. They say the best liars are those who stick close to thetruth, then at the critical moment omit a crucial detail, or change the story.In this instance, they’re keeping you from realizing an important truth.The brains of those with Alzheimer’s have a different genetic makeup from thosewho don’t have the disease. If you haven’t kept up with the field of geneticslately, you might simply think you have what you have. It’s your geneticdestiny, right?Except for the fact that retroviruses mess everything up.They are RNA viruses, so in order to integrate into a DNA-based organism (you!),they need a certain enzyme. That enzyme is called reverse transcriptase (RT).The main place we ever see RT is in the presence of a retrovirus. Approximately8 percent of the human genome is made up of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) thathave been integrated into our DNA. These ERVs can be activated to expressthemselves and cause damage, but for the most part they are kept silent bymethylation. In addition, they are usually not replication-competent ortransmissible. Thus, even if you do have many silenced ERVs in your genome,there will likely be no reverse transcriptase activity. Measuring the expressionof reverse transcriptase activity is how Frank and Bernie Poiesz succeeded inisolating the first disease-associated human retrovirus, HTLV-1. I rememberFrank telling me the story of watching the Geiger counter as they measured theincorporation of a radioactive tag showing RT activity as they tried to isolateHTLV-1. Usually the background counts are less than one hundred counts perminute (cpm). Their hearts raced one fateful night when they saw the countershot up to one thousand cpm, showing they were on the right track.But the article doesn’t tell you that the rationale for using HIV drugs inAlzheimer’s disease is that the overexpression of RT would indicate the activityof either ERVs or other retroviruses.They simply say, hey, why don’t we use those HIV drugs that inhibit RT? We mightbe able to treat Alzheimer’s disease and improve the lives of millions.Could acquired retroviruses, perhaps from animal tissues in vaccines, beexpressing RT and recombining with ERVs? They don’t want you to understand that.Because if you did, you’d start asking inconvenient questions.I wonder how long it will be until the scientists who reported these findingswill find themselves under attack."},{"pageContent":"Platesimages [../Images/p0001-01.jpg]Getting my doctorate in bio-chemistry and molecular biology from GeorgeWashington University in 1991.

It lists as itsgrantors the National Institutes of Health, the US Food and Drug Administration,and the US Army Medical Research and Material Command. It’s physically housedwithin the Blood Centers of the Pacific in San Francisco. Its collaboratorsinclude the University of California, San Francisco; Oakland Children’sHospital; the US Department of Veteran Affairs; the American Red Cross; and theSouth African National Blood Service. It also has numerous corporatecollaborations, including Cerus, Roche, and Abbott Laboratories.The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute is a little less opaque. It’ssimply the third largest division of the National Institutes of Health and issituated in Bethesda, Maryland.The plan was relatively simple to assess the threat to the blood supply and howto solve any problems we discovered. We’d do it in three phases.The first was to design primers that would detect XMRV with an accurate, fast,and inexpensive PCR test. In addition, we were to develop a serology test todetect antibodies, the kind of test that had discovered Magic Johnson’s HIVinfection two decades earlier.The second phase was to verify the accuracy of the tests we developed in naturalsamples drawn from known positive patients from the original study.The third was to do a blinded trial with the diagnostic tests to determine theirsensitivity and specificity. We did not want to misdiagnose an infected personas not infected and vice versa.The antibodies we used in our serology test as published in our Science paperwere excellent for the detection of XMRV and remain so to this day. It was theonly test that detected all XMRV family members accurately. It should have beenenough, if we were really trying to determine if there had been exposure toXMRV.By way of comparison, Magic Johnson never had infectious HIV isolated from hissystem. His blood test showed antibodies to HIV, meaning he’d been exposed tothe retrovirus and could be expected to develop AIDS and die from it.That’s why getting him started on the antiretrovirals so early was important.They silenced expression of the virus, which is how the immune system getsdamaged.But I don’t believe those in charge were simply interested in having a reliabletest. There were too many other factors in play.image [../Images/common.jpg]XMRV was poised to be much bigger than HIV.When Magic Johnson was diagnosed in 1991, it was estimated that one millionAmericans were infected with HIV. Our research showed 3.75 percent of thepopulation was carrying this virus. Columbia University professor Ian Lipkin’smulticenter study and his later study with Dr. Montoya of Stanford Universityshowed about 6 percent of the population was carrying the virus. Laskeraward-winning researcher Harvey Alter and his colleague Shyh-Ching Lo found 6.6percent of the healthy controls to be positive for XMRV and related members. Wehad been on the conservative side in estimating the size of this epidemic. Ifyou take these numbers as a range, there are somewhere between ten and twentymillion Americans carrying some variant of the XMRV family of viruses.I believe the lesson of HIV-AIDS is that when there’s a threat to a singleperson or group, it’s a threat to all of us.The mistake we made in HIV-AIDS was to look from a position of moral superiorityon the gay and drug-using population, instead of seeing the problem as one forthe entire human family. What affects one affects us all. That’s not simply aspiritual perspective, but one that is grounded in solid science. Sprayingpesticides on the plants to kill insects is also likely to harm a lot of otherliving things, including humans.Some may fault us for our approach, but it made no sense that XMRVs would besolely linked with ME/CFS and prostate cancer. That was not what the data fromthree years of family studies suggested, and it was not what we had learnedabout retroviruses. The virus had first been found in prostate cancer tissue.Last I checked, women don’t have prostates. That’s why we were so focused on thefamily studies and seeing the patterns of disease in those groups. Were wesurprised to find autism in the children of mothers affected by ME/CFS?We would not have predicted these results at the outset. But once the datasuggested it, the pathology made a good deal of sense to us.For God’s sake, for decades we’d been advising pregnant women infected with HIVto put their children immediately on antiretroviral drugs prior to anyimmunization for fear that a vaccine might trigger full-blown AIDS. The virusliked to hide out in the monocytes, the B and T cells of the immune systems,exactly those cells a vaccination would stimulate.This wasn’t rocket science.All we were saying was if this time bomb was already in a good percentage of thepopulation, we didn’t want to be setting off an explosion of neuroimmune diseaseand cancer with a vaccination.In 2010, it was estimated that the cost to test a patient for HIV was abouttwenty-two dollars. At that time, it was estimated that approximatelythirty-four million people were infected with HIV around the world. Every one ofthem required a blood test. That meant hundreds of millions of dollars forwhoever owned the right to the test.Let’s take the lower figure that approximately 4 percent of the United Stateswas infected with XMRV in 2010, shortly after the publication of our research.That’s twelve million Americans. If we looked at that in terms of the worldpopulation at that time, it meant somewhere around 275 million people around theglobe were infected with XMRV.An effective blood test for XMRV wouldn’t be worth hundreds of millions ofdollars.It would be worth billions.You probably won’t be surprised to learn that Frank and I were the soleinventors of XMRV along with our research institutions in a patent applicationdated April 6, 2010, for “Strains of Xenotropic Murine Leukemia-Related Virusand Methods for Detection Thereof,” and received the patent application number20110311484.The abstract to our application stated:Provided are novel strains of Xenotropic Murine Leukemia Virus-Related Virus(XMRV), or polynucleotides or polypeptides thereof. Identified herein arenucleic acid changes or amino acid changes identified in XMRV strains isolatedfrom subjects. Also provided are methods of detecting such XMRV strains based atleast in part on the identified nucleic acid changes or amino acid changes.1[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn6_1]A couple of things are important for you to notice. As you can tell, wedistinctly refer to there being multiple strains of XMRV, and we had isolatedthese strains from actual patients. From the beginning, our data in the 2009Science paper suggested there were multiple strains. We also isolated thevariant strains from actual patients, not like others who used VP62, a molecularviral clone as a stand-in for the actual virus.image [../Images/common.jpg]After our research was published in October of 2009, I was deluged with phonecalls.Many were from patients with ME/CFS who wanted to know what it meant for theirdisease, some were from clinicians who felt we might have finally found the lastpiece of the puzzle for many of their patients, and one was from Cerus, acompany in Concord, California.As I recall, it was one of the vice presidents of the company, Dr. Lily Lin, whospoke on the phone with me. She was impressed with the paper and said itdovetailed with some studies they’d been doing regarding decontaminatingretroviral threats to the blood supply. And more important, she believed hercompany had a technology, the INTERCEPT system, that could safely neutralize anyRNA viruses, including retroviruses, which might be in a blood sample.It was not lost on us given our experience with HIV, but if you could easily andreliably decontaminate any blood donations that came in, you probably didn’tneed a test. The value of a test might be lower if you could simply choose todecontaminate all blood.I gave Lily a presentation in a coffee shop near the company headquarters,showing the data of the viral proteins expressed and antibodies made to them andshowing we had more than simply an incomplete genetic sequence. It brought meback to what Robert Silverman of the Cleveland Clinic had told me when we firststarted sharing findings. “I hope you can get an immune response,” he said.“Because we’ve done thousands of samples and they’re all negative.” Of course,they were negative, because he was using his Frankenstein stitched-togethermolecular clone of the virus, named VP62, which has never existed in an actualhuman being.The Abbott blood test didn’t work because it was not detecting the sequencesthat had been isolated from a human being or recognize the possibility of aconformational epitope. If you have the wrong sequence, the correspondingprotein won’t fold into the shape detected by our original serology assay. (Yes,we will talk about why you never use an infectious molecular clone when you’restudying viruses in the next chapter.)So, what we did with Cerus was more or less exactly what I’d done at Upjohnthirty years earlier. We simply sent samples of blood from individuals infectedwith XMRVs. They’d use their INTERCEPT technology on it, then send it back to usto see if the blood was now free of infectious XMRV. The Cerus technology workedbeautifully.At the time I was fired from the Whittemore-Peterson Institute, my lab wasworking on a study with Cerus that was looking at patients from OaklandChildren’s Hospital who’d received multiple blood transfusions. If retroviruseswere present in the blood supply, it meant we’d find a higher rate of XMRVs inthe transfused children than in any of our control groups. I couldn’t finish thestudy because of being fired and the data removed from my office. But thepreliminary set of data from those children showed an infection rate of around 8percent. I have never seen the published results of that study and suspect itwas simply filed in a drawer to be forgotten or, worse yet, destroyed. Eightpercent was significantly higher than the 3.75 percent we’d found in ouroriginal science paper, or the 6 percent Lipkin found in his multicenter study,or the 6.6 percent that Harvey Alter and Shyh-Ching Lo found in theirconfirmation study of our work.On March 29, 2011, I presented our findings on XMRV at the New York Academy ofSciences. At the end, I noted my five main points as being:1. Data suggest there are different strains of gamma-retroviruses that caninfect humans.2. Assays that capture the variation of these viruses in the blood supply arethe best, i.e., serology and transmission.3. Cerus Technologies can inactivate strains of XMRV/HGRVs in blood components.4. New disease associations include leukemia, lymphoma, and theplatelet/megakaryocyte blood disorder ITP.5. We need more full-length sequencing.I think it’s clear that while we had little trouble discussing the public healthrisk suggested by the data, we also had little hesitation suggesting solutionsthat were supported by our collaboration. Cerus had a great product that woulddeal with the threat to the blood supply.The only problem, I realized much later, was that the government didn’t want toadmit there had been a threat to the blood supply. Our 8 percent finding ofXMRVs in children who’d received multiple transfusions through OaklandChildren’s Hospital hinted at enormous legal liability for the blood banks. Thatapplied equally to the government agencies, which had verified the safety ofthose blood banks, and the blood supply in general, to the public.image [../Images/common.jpg]“Agency heads are scared to death of how the patient population will react ifXMRV works out.” This is a direct quote from the well-known ME/CFS patientwebsite Phoenix Rising. It was alleged by a forum member to have been said onSeptember 11, 2010, by Suzanne Vernon, the scientific director of the ChronicFatigue Immune Dysfunction Syndrome Association of America (CFIDS). Thisallegedly happened in a discussion between the forum member, Suzanne Vernon, andadvocate Cort Johnson during a break at the 2010 OFFER Utah Patient EducationConference in the lobby of the Salt Lake City downtown Hilton.The forum member, identified as “CBS,” a senior member of the Phoenix Risingforum with more than 1,400 posts at the time, added, “I’ve been struggling[with] what I ought to do with this for almost six months. Suzanne Vernon saidthis during a conversation she was having with me and Cort. She just sort ofinterjected it. No real need, nor was there much of a segue. She said that itshould not be repeated. Yet I wondered why on Earth she would say something likethat to someone she had just met.”2 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn6_2]I include this account to reinforce my feelings that people with whom I had noconnection believed that our federal government did not want XMRV to work out.And why not?Well, as I’ve said before, it would be a huge liability for the United Statesgovernment.While I couldn’t personally attest to Suzanne Vernon making those comments inSeptember of 2010, less than a year after our publication in Science, I was alsoobserving some unusual behavior among government and corporate researchers.Why might Suzanne Vernon have been reporting on September 11, 2010, that agencyheads were worried about XMRV working out? Maybe because on September 7 and 8,2010, the First International Workshop on XMRV took place, and there was a gooddeal of research that supported our findings.Maureen Hanson of Cornell University submitted an abstract titled “XMRV inChronic Fatigue Syndrome: A Pilot Study,” which looked at ten subjects withsevere CFS, ten who had “recovered,” and ten controls. Dr. B. P. Danielson ofBaylor University contributed “XMRV Infection of Prostate Cancer Patients fromthe Southern United States and Analysis of Possible Correlates of Infection.”From Emory University came more evidence of XMRVs in prostate cancer, asdocumented in their abstract “Variant XMRVs in Clinical Prostate Cancer.” TheCleveland Clinic and Robert Silverman submitted two abstracts, “Presence of XMRVRNA in Urine of Prostate Cancer Patients” and “XMRV Infection Induces Host Genesthat Regulate Inflammation and Cellular Physiology.” Paul Cheney, who would goonto work with Jeff Bradstreet up until his mysterious death, submitted apositive paper titled “XMRV Detection in a National Practice Specializing inChronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS).”A troubling result came from a paper submitted that was a collaboration betweenEmory University, the Cleveland Clinic, and Abbott Laboratories. Their abstract,“XMRV Induces a Chronic Replicative Infection in Rhesus Macaques Tissue But Notin Blood,” told a horrifying tale, both for sufferers and researchers attemptingto make sense of it all. They found the virus disappeared relatively quicklyfrom the blood but would replicate to detectable levels upon any immunestimulation, such as from a vaccine.In other words, a vaccination could awaken a sleeping monster.This was the very scenario I had publicly suggested shortly after publication ofour work.Lasker Award winner for his discovery of the hepatitis C virus, Dr. HarveyAlter, was finally able to talk about his long-delayed paper that had finallybeen published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. He wrote:We found MLV-like gag gene sequences in 32 of 37 patients (86.5%) compared withonly 3 of 44 (6.8%) healthy volunteer blood donors. . . . No evidence ofcontamination with mouse DNA was detected in the PCR assay system or any of theclinical samples. Seven of 8 gag-positive patients were again positive in asample obtained nearly 15 years later.3 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn6_3]I thought the most controversial abstract would be the one I’d worked on withFrank Ruscetti with the title “Detection of Infectious XMRV in the PeripheralBlood of Children.” We wrote:[A]n understanding of XMRV infection rate in children may be particularlyhelpful, given that 1 in 100 children in the US are diagnosed with neuro-immunedisorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and that CFS and childhoodneuroimmune disorders share common clinical features including immunedysregulation, increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines andchemokines, and chronic active microbial infections.XMRV was detected in 55% of 66 cases of familial groups from 11 states.Sequencing of PCR products of gag and env confirmed XMRV. The age range of theinfected children was 2–18. 17 of the children (including the identical twins)were positive for XMRV (58%) and 20 of the 37 parents (54%) were positive forXMRV. 14 of 17 autistic children were positive for XMRV (82%).4[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn6_4]That should have been the bombshell.Not only were we saying we’d found a pathogen responsible for the cascade ofimmune dysfunction resulting in ME/CFS, but that this same retrovirus family mayhave also given birth to the autism epidemic. The terrible lesson of theHIV-AIDS epidemic is that there are no “deplorables” among us. We are allconnected, and if any one of us suffers, that pain will eventually reacheverybody.But it wasn’t children, suffering families, or autism that attracted theattention of Dr. Francis Collins, head of the National Institutes of Health.Collins cared about the blood supply.image [../Images/common.jpg]Collins attended the opening of the session, held in the Masur Auditorium in themain building of the National Institutes of Health, located in Bethesda,Maryland. He listened for a short while, then left. He reappeared on the secondday to listen to my talk. We’d put together an abstract titled “Detection ofInfectious XMRV in the Peripheral Blood of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Patients inthe United Kingdom,” which attracted serious attention.England was one of the epicenters of ME/CFS, and I felt a strong sense ofresponsibility toward them for the support they’d always given our efforts. Theinvestigation we’d put together in the United Kingdom had been dramatic,involving nearly fifty patients, arranging car rides for people to blood drawcenters in churches, or even a few of the patients receiving visits fromphlebotomists at their homes to get a sample.We thought the United Kingdom study was a tour de force of scientific research,especially since the samples were not drawn or processed in a lab. They wereprocessed in churches and homes, essentially eliminating any possibility ofcontamination. Our findings were similar to what we’d previously reported amongsufferers of the disease, and the controls were also in line with previousfindings of about 4 percent in healthy controls.I felt as if everybody in the auditorium turned to look at Francis Collins whenhe raised a hand to ask a question.“Yes?” I said, my heart pounding.“Where did you get the 4 percent positive controls?” Collins asked.“The blood supply in the UK,” I explained, noting we’d also obtained fifty orsixty additional positive controls, age and sex matched to the UK ME/CFSpatients.I think that was the moment Collins decided he needed to call Dr. Tony Fauci,head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID).Finally, no longer would these suffering patients be considered crazy and deniedthe same type of therapies that had ended the threat of HIV-AIDS. But little didI know that Dr. Fauci was not about to let this happen. What did Fauci do? Hecalled in Dr. Ian Lipkin to lead that validation study.Dr. Ian Lipkin of Columbia University, the great debunker, who had participatedin a similar shameful episode against a doctor I’ve now come to know well, Dr.Andrew Wakefield. In my estimation, Dr. Wakefield is our greatest scientificmartyr, for his initial suspicions voiced in a series of case reports for TheLancet, of a connection between the MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) shot and thedevelopment of gastrointestinal problems and autism.When I met my attorney Mike Hugo, he said, “This might sound a little strange,but I’ve got an expression for what I think has happened to you.”“What’s that?” I asked.“You’ve been Wakefielded.”I laughed. “I know Andy.” We had talked at length about a study we had donelooking for an association of XMRV with ITP, in collaboration with Dr. JamesBussels of New York City. (ITP is idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, adisorder that can lead to easy and excessive bruising and is thought to resultfrom low levels of platelets that help with blood clotting. ITP is aCDC-acknowledged side effect of MMR. We found evidence of ITP in 30 percent ofthe sixty or so patient samples we tested with our serology test. Interestingly,there was no correlation with fatigue.)I thought speaking to the head of the National Institutes of Health about asolution to our biggest health crisis since the HIV-AIDS epidemic was the momentwhen science would fulfill its most important duty to the public.Instead, Collins was setting me up with Lipkin, the same man who had WakefieldedDr. Andrew Wakefield. And looking over it all would be Tony Fauci, head of theNational Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and the boss of Kuan-TehJeang, editor of the journal Retrovirology, who would also eventually die undermysterious circumstances, just like my friend, Jeff Bradstreet.I never realized scientific and medical research could be so dangerous to aperson’s health.image [../Images/common.jpg]That first meeting with Dr. Ian Lipkin of Columbia University on November 4,2010, was ostensibly to design a multicenter study to confirm our findingsregarding XMRV and ME/CFS.If that were so, why were there members of the Blood XMRV Scientific WorkingGroup (called Blood Working Group) present? People like John Coffin; SimoneGlynn of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Association; and Susanne Vernon,former veteran of the Centers for Disease Control, who only two months earlierexpressed that those same agency heads were “scared to death” of the XMRVassociation with ME/CFS. What were they doing there? The Blood XMRV SWRG AKA“Blood Working Group” had nothing to do with the association of XMRV withME/CFS!I think somebody up very high had decided that XMRV and this whole issue had togo away, and they’d assembled the team to make it happen. The assassination hadbeen planned, and I was the only one in the group who didn’t know it.If there had been no effort to control the discussion about XMRV and ME/CFS aswell as a myriad of other diseases, here’s how I think things would have gone.In October of 2009, we published our findings in the journal Science.In a meeting on November 10, 2009, Dr. Gary Owens of the University of Virginiatold us he’d confirmed XMRV-2 in cardiac tissue. Now we’ve got some heartproblems connected to that retrovirus family.In a closed meeting in Zagreb, Croatia, on May 25 and 26, 2010, Dr. Harvey Alterconfirmed our findings as reported in a Dutch health magazine. A direct quotefrom the article states:The FDA and the NIH have independently confirmed the XMRV findings as publishedin Science, October [2009]. The confirmation was issued by Dr. Harvey Alter ofthe NIH during a closed workshop on blood transfusion held on May 25–26 inZagreb . . . The association with CFS is very strong, but causality not proved.XMRV and related MLVs are in the donor supply with a prevalence of 3% and 7%. We(FDA and NIH) have independently confirmed Lombardi group findings.5[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn6_5]Pretty much sounds like game over, doesn’t it? You have an award-winningresearcher working with a team that includes scientists from the Food and DrugAdministration and the National Institutes of Health, and they confirm yourwork. In addition, they find somewhere between 3 percent and 7 percent of thepopulation infected with this virus or related family members.Time for action and getting to work solving the problem, right?No, this is where I believe the sabotage began.I think this is when they realized they had an unsafe blood supply, they’dharmed a lot of people, and there would be enormous liability for blood banksand government agencies when this information was revealed.The sabotage was done by using Robert Silverman’s synthetic infectious molecularclone as a reference for the virus and taking me out of the equation. In phasetwo of the blood working group, I’d been the one blinding the samples, so theresearchers didn’t know which samples were positive and which were negative.Remember, we were supposed to come up with a quick and inexpensive PCRdiagnostic test in the blood working group. And the truth was, as expected,Switzer and the CDC researchers weren’t getting good results from the PCR basedon the VP62 Frankenstein clone. I realized the problem was likely naturalisolates of XMRV in the infected people were usually latent/silent. Only in thesickest patients could XMRV be detected in the blood. This had been our seminalwork in HIV latency. You see, most retroviruses contain many cytosine/guaninepairs, CpGs in the promoters. This means the on/off switch of XMRVs turned offand the virus was silenced by the addition of methyl groups and would not bedetected in a 30-second PCR test. That fact that the XMRV on switch/promoter wasa highly-methylated molecule was critical. Most other viruses do not have somany CpG pairs in the on/off switch. They are easier to pull apart. This factmight be lost on the general public, but every virologist worth their degreeknew what it meant. A quick-and-dirty PCR would never reveal the secrets of thisvirus and thus would be a silent contaminator of the blood supply.When I provided this explanation at the September 22, 2011, Ottawa conferencewhere I squared off against John Coffin, I had so many people come up to me andsay, “That’s brilliant! That explains the data perfectly.”Let me say that again.XMRV is tightly bound with high levels of cytosine and guanine in aconfiguration that is difficult for a typical PCR test to detect. The typicalthirty-second denaturization procedure of a typical PCR test is not enough topull these molecules apart and reveal their secrets.We needed to find another way to test for this virus or simply use the CerusINTERCEPT technology to decontaminate the blood supply. But the simple fact wasthat the Science publication of September 22, 2011, from the Blood Working Groupwas going to be used to discount the association of XMRVs to ME/CFS, not todiscuss the contamination of the blood supply, which was in fact the ONLYmission of the Blood XMRV SWRG. These “scared-to-death public officials,” to usethe words of Suzanne Vernon, were not going to wait more than a year for theofficial Lipkin debunking show.They were going to fraudulently publish the results from the Blood Working Groupto slit my throat and hope I bled to death on the floor.image [../Images/common.jpg]How’s this for a perfect storm?My employer, the Whittemore-Peterson Institute of the University of Nevada,Reno, was funded by the real estate holdings of the Whittemore family. Therecession had devastated their finances, as it had many large landowners, andthey were hopeful we’d come up with a PCR test for the blood supply. That wouldhave done wonders for their financial picture and the people from whom they’dborrowed money. It was potentially worth billions of dollars.But there I was saying that any PCR test or serology test based on the VP62clone was worthless, including the one their company VIPDx had been selling.Abbott had licensed that clone from Silverman and expected it to be worthbillions of dollars. Was this why Silverman kept pushing VP62, even when itbecame clear that wasn’t the sequence of XMRV, or even a useful model?On the other side was a public health establishment, desperate for XMRV to bedebunked, thus absolving them of billions of dollars of potential legalliability.And instead of supporting the establishment cause, there I was, saying, no,XMRVs are real and are probably responsible for many health conditions and werein many cases likely to have been transmitted through the blood supply.I always say science doesn’t have a side. It’s just about truth. But thatdoesn’t consider our modern world and how it’s corrupted science.On one side were scientists who’d opened an area of inquiry, but they had thewrong sequence for the virus, and their tests were worthless.On the other was the public health establishment, which simply wanted it all togo away.And there was me, saying, yes, there is something here, but we don’t have it yetnailed down. But when we do figure it out, it’s going to be larger than anybodycan imagine.How bad did it get?Worse than you can imagine.image [../Images/common.jpg]I got a call from Michael Busch on August 31, 2011, telling me I had to finishfinal edits of the paper reporting the results of the Blood Working Group a weeklater (the Tuesday after Labor Day) because that was the last day if it was tobe published by Science on September 22, and it would now be titled “Failure toConfirm XMRV/MLVs in the Blood of Patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: AMulti-Laboratory Study.”I was enormously frustrated and angry.The Blood Working Group was tasked with finding whether a fast and inexpensivePCR or serology test could be developed for the blood supply. If they had wantedto write—we had failed to develop an accurate test for the blood supply—that wasfine with me. That was accurate. And I thought I could explain that failure in away that made scientific sense.The title suggested we’d done an association study, which we had not.There were only fifteen patients in the Blood Working Group sample.That was not an association study.I was being given a single day to approve the paper as written, and as writtenit was simply fraud.This was not science. It was pure politics.Here’s the email I sent back to Simone Glynn on August 31, 2011, at 8:24 p.m.,PDT, of that same day. If this was pure politics, I’m sure you’ll agree I’m nodiplomat. But I am a fighter. I wrote to Simone in response to her request toapprove the paper as written in a single day in order to have a record of whatwas being done:That’s impossible.I have IRB protected data that I cannot access until the 6th. I told that toGraham yesterday and he indicated it was fine. Given the complexities andlimitations of this study, many of which were not recognized at the time the(flawed) experimental design was agreed upon. To have one day to agree upon amanuscript, a holiday at that, is totally unacceptable. This is NOT good scienceor the appropriate process. What is the rush?Afraid of the truth??? How many of these viruses were introduced into the humanpopulation and are now threatening a lot more than the blood supply??? Because afew declared it “impossible” 40 years ago and JC [John Coffin] himself was themost vociferous??How many XMRVs??I am sending this only to Simone and Frank because I will make this rush apublic relations nightmare for the entire US govt. I have integration data andvariants of many new strains!! Did those arrogant SOBs introduce these intohumans and are now trying to cover it up??And then pedigree the negatives with a cutoff so high it would not find awilling woman in a whore house?? Wonder if anyone will listen to a pressconference from me?? Asking how many new recombinants from vaccines? From labworkers?? Doctors? The first ever contagious human retrovirus???? Spread likemycoplasma?? Are you kidding me???It happened once!!! How many xenograft lines were created??? How many vaccinescontained mouse tissue??These sick people lost their entire lives and this travesty of justice will notbe carried out at their expense. Not again.If we have to write and publish online a dissenting opinion, we will and I willnot coauthor any paper that misrepresents our findings. Nor will our data beincluded. You can simply say we all found nothing. Totally expected and we’llprove them all wrong.Our assays may not be sensitive or reproducible given the complexity and lack ofknowledge of reservoirs, etc. Nothing about these data say anything aboutLombardi et al, Lo et al. Except that there are likely many strains of XMRVs andGod only knows the impact on chronic disease. But nothing about this study saysanything about our original discoveries.And if this is rushed to print without a fair and balanced discussion of itslimitations, I will spend every minute of my life exposing the fraud that hasbeen perpetrated against this patient population.Judy Mikovits.Yes, I was heated, but I had good reason to be angry. This email generated aphone call that Labor Day from Michael Busch and Simone Glynn.Simone said, “I have Harold Varmus [Head of the National Cancer Institute at thetime] on the phone, and if you and Frank do not coauthor this paper, Frank andSandy will be fired for fraud (for our 2009 Science paper) immediately and losetheir pension. They will lose their entire retirement.”Yes, Simone Glynn, head of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute,threatened the pensions of two senior scientists, claiming to have the supportof the head of the National Cancer Institute on her side.Mike Busch and Simone said they’d change the language of the article and thetitle to language acceptable to me. But they didn’t, and it got published withthe fraudulent title and data interpretation.I think that paper is the greatest example of scientific misconduct I’ve everwitnessed in my life, and everybody who willingly put their name on it should bedriven out of science.There were only fifteen patients in the study. That’s not an association study.It was a cover-up of the contaminated blood supply.In the article written for Science about my face-off with John Coffin on thisissue at the September 22, 2011, Ottawa IACFS conference, and published onSeptember 30, 2011, Jon Cohen ended the piece by saying, “Mikovits said shehopes to have full sequences of her new viruses in a couple of weeks.”I was fired the day before that article came out because I wouldn’t say thediagnostic test my employers were using in their private company, VIPDx, wasvalidated, nor allow the director of that company to say he had worked on agovernment grant when he had not. Once again, my honesty got me in trouble.Harvey Whittemore knew exactly which of my desk drawers contained the actualsequence of the virus. How convenient for Jon Cohen to write that article,knowing I’d never see those sequences again!I had no lab, I was prevented from getting a new job with the grants, which hadbeen awarded to me as principal investigator. I was jailed, and the contents oftwo offices, the data of those of my research teams, and the work of my entirecareer were all locked down, never to be seen by me again.Is that the way we are to do science in the future?If a scientist uncovers troubling information that affects the lives ofmillions, that information will simply be locked away, while perpetrators ofscientific fraud and crimes against humanity are rewarded with millions ofdollars? It’s almost like 1934 in Los Angeles with the sick medical staff allover again.It’s almost as if I never existed.image [../Images/common.jpg]Cerus was the one who made out like a bandit.Maybe I shouldn’t be so disturbed by the behavior of Cerus. They were simplylooking to provide a service and make money, not get in the middle of what waspotentially a multibillion-dollar fight between patients and the United StatesGovernment.The INTERCEPT Blood System Technology is truly revolutionary. As described intheir 2017 Annual Report, the blood samples are:[P]laced in an illumination device, or illuminator, where the mixture is exposedto ultra-violet A or UVA light. If pathogens such as viruses, bacteria orparasites, as well as leukocytes, or white cells, are present in the platelet orplasma components, the energy from the UVA causes the amotosalen to bond withthe nucleic acid. Since platelets and plasma do not rely on nucleic acid fortherapeutic efficacy, the INTERCEPT Blood System is designed to preserve thetherapeutic function of the platelet and plasma components when used in humantransfusions.6 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn6_6]You see, science is up to the challenge of solving difficult problems. I alsothink it helps if the truth is told, but apparently, that’s not required inpublic health.In 2009, Cerus reported sales of $16.8 million against operating expenses of29.2 million dollars, noting their fourh quarter sales had gone up 51 percentover the previous year, crediting the rise to growing acceptance of theirproduct in France, Belgium, Southern Europe, and the Middle East. In Septemberof 2010, a press release from Cerus demonstrated the success we’d had with theirtechnology:The Whittemore-Peterson Institute for Neuro-Immune Disease (WPI) and CerusCorporation presented data at today’s NIH-sponsored 1st international Workshopon XMRV which demonstrates the efficacy of Cerus; INTERCEPT Blood System toinactivate XMRV and other MLV-related viruses in donated blood. Recentscientific studies have detected these human retroviruses in up to seven percentof healthy blood donor samples, indicating approximately 20 million people inthe United States could unknowingly be carrying the infection of XMRV andMLV-related viruses have been linked to prostate cancer and myalgicencephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS).“The genetic variability of XMRV and MLV-related viruses will make developmentof screening assays for the blood supply challenging,” said Dr. Judy Mikovits,director of research at WPI and lead author of the study. “The INTERCEPTtechnology demonstrates robust inactivation of these viruses and holds promiseas a potential proactive approach to mitigating the risk of XMRV/MLV-relatedvirus transmission via transfusion.”7 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn6_7]The same press release highlighted what should have been definitive confirmationof XMRV by leading government research institutions as well as the methods weused, which did NOT include VP62, the infectious molecular clone:In a paper published online on August 23, 2010 in the journal Proceedings of theNational Academy of Sciences (PNAS), scientists from the National Institutes ofHealth and U.S. Food and Drug Administration detected the presence of agenetically diverse group of MLV-related viruses in 86 percent of CFS patientsamples and in 6.8 percent of samples from healthy blood donors, leading to newconcerns about the possibility of transfusion transmission. The PNAS studyresults are consistent with data from a 2009 study published in Science, whichdetected XMRV in 67 percent of CFS patients and 3.7 percent of healthy controls.In the study conducted by WPI and Cerus, red blood cell and platelet componentswere contaminated with a natural isolate (italics mine) of XMRV and MLV-relatedviruses from an ME/CFS patient. INTERCEPT-treated and control samples wereevaluated in a validated virus culture test (italics mine), which allowssensitive detection of viral particles that are capable of reproducing. Noviable virus was detected following treatment, indicating the intercept BloodSystem is capable of inactivating high levels (>4 logs) of the virus.8[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn6_8]Just to recap what the previous paragraphs revealed: scientists from theNational Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration in 2010 foundXMRV-related viruses in 86 percent of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome andin 6.8 percent of healthy controls.This was an even more robust finding than our 2009 paper showing XMRV in 67percent of patients and in 3.7 percent of healthy controls.Our research DID NOT focus on a PCR test, but a virus culture test, whichallowed for detection of viral particles capable of reproducing and proteins andimmune response serology testing.The Cerus INTERCEPT Blood System seemed to completely eliminate the threat tothe blood supply posed by XMRV, at least to the best of our detectiontechnology.We were the ones doing good science.However, our good science would raise serious questions about the dangerouspractices of the past, and how many were today suffering as a result of thosemistakes.image [../Images/common.jpg]In a January 7, 2019, press release, Cerus announced they’d exceeded their 2018projection of fifty-eight million to sixty million in revenue, bringing in $60.9million. They expect 2019 to be an even better year, estimating sales betweenseventy and seventy-three million dollars.“The revenue growth we generated in 2018 underscores the increasing demand forsafer blood components. We finished 2018 strong with quarter-over-quarter andyear-to-date growth in disposable kits led by French national conversion andU.S. demand,” said William “Obi” Greenman, Cerus’ president and chief executiveofficer.“Over the past few months, U.S. customer orders for INTERCEPT platelets havebeen increasing. With the recent FDA publication of the draft guidance documenton bacterial risk control strategies for platelet collection and transfusion, wecould potentially experience further acceleration in customer demand in theU.S.,” continued Greenman.9 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn6_9]Perhaps it’s a little too much to expect a company making sixty to seventymillion dollars a year to point out a liability to the United States governmentof billions of dollars.But wait, I’m a little confused. The government says there’s no threat to theblood supply. So why is a company making tens of millions of dollars making theblood supply safe, when according to our leading public health authorities it’salready safe? Are they just being extracareful?I can imagine a corporate board meeting at Cerus where the executives ponderthis question. On the one hand, they say to themselves, if we go along with thegovernment’s lies, we’ll make a lot of money and be a successful company. On theother, if we tell the truth, we can expect within a short time to be raided bygovernment agents on some flimsy pretext. And even if we prevail in court, thebad publicity will cause the company to fail. Which direction would theexecutives choose?This is what the government wants you to believe. The blood supply is totallysafe. They just want to make it safer by spending tens of millions of dollars ona completely unnecessary system. Pay no attention to what may or may not havehappened in the past.Am I being too sarcastic?Let me give it to you straight, then.The blood supply was and is not safe, and Cerus and the various governmentagencies know it.As a private individual, I thought I could defend my scientific reputation byexercising my constitutional rights. I was wrong. I still haven’t had a singleday in court, and my attorney has been disbarred for giving money to his elderlyfather without having a loan agreement.Still, I can’t help but think that somebody out there somewhere in a position ofinfluence, who can tip the balance toward truth and disclosure, will somedaylisten to the voice of their conscience and act.I’d like to wish Cerus well, because I believe their technology is saving lives.However, as they are part of what I consider to be a continuing criminalenterprise to cover up the truth about lab-derived animal retroviruses andmicrobial agents infecting the public and causing many different diseases, Imust reluctantly decline."},{"pageContent":"images [../Images/line.jpg]CHAPTER SEvENVP62—The Clone Assassinimages [../Images/line.jpg]Biology does not necessarily follow technology.That may be one of the most important things I write in this book, so let meemphasize it again.Biology does not necessarily follow technology.Let me explain what I mean by that statement.Just because you come up with a new piece of technology, which lets you knowmore than you knew before, doesn’t mean you now know EVERYTHING.Scientists must have humility when approaching the unknown. The rush to judgmentis a critical error many scientists made in the XMRV debate, even regardless ofwhether there was financial pressure for them to come to a result different fromours.I love technology, but I’m also aware of its limitations. I’ll always take thenew information to deepen my understanding. But a good scientist will alsorealize the limitations and unanswered questions that remain.image [../Images/common.jpg]How did all this start?Why did people start looking at a mouse virus and its link to conditions likeprostate cancer in men, ME/CFS in an overwhelmingly female population, anddiseases like autism in children? And might this retrovirus family or anotherone much like it be linked to the new diseases of aging, like Alzheimer’s?All of that started with a new piece of technology that made an unexpecteddiscovery of mouse-related retroviral sequences in tissues from prostate cancertumors. Joe DeRisi is a professor at the University of California, SanFrancisco, with an interest in how technology might unlock biological processes,such as how viruses might be driving the development of cancer.DeRisi chose a TED Talk on January 29, 2006, to discuss his technologicalinnovation, known as the ViroChip, and what he had discovered when RobertSilverman of the Cleveland Clinic hypothesized men with a genetic defectresulting in an inability to degrade RNA viruses would be more susceptible toretroviral infection. This would lead to these men having more aggressivecancers. Silverman provided DeRisi with some tissue from prostate cancer tumors.DeRisi tested the tissue to prove or disprove that hypothesis.DeRisi opened his talk by asking questions of the assembled audience:How can we investigate this flora of viruses that surround us, and aid medicine?How can we turn our cumulative knowledge of virology into a simple, hand-held,single diagnostic assay? I want to turn everything we know right now aboutdetecting viruses and the spectrum of viruses that are out there into, let’ssay, a small chip.When we started thinking about this project—how we could make a singlediagnostic assay to screen for all pathogens simultaneously—well, there’s someproblems with this idea. First of all, viruses are pretty complex, but they’realso evolving fast . . .1 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn7_1]Everything about DeRisi’s opening was perfect. What scientist doesn’t want tostreamline what we know about viruses into a simple test that can be used toquickly identify a potential pathogen impacting health?I know I do.And DeRisi also noted that viruses are complex and evolve quickly. The majorityof DeRisi’s talk concerned the development of his chip and the complexity ofviruses, but he saved the bombshell for the end:I’m going to tell you one thing in the last two minutes that’s unpublished. It’scoming out tomorrow. And it’s an interesting case of how you might use this chipto find something new and open a new door. Prostate cancer. I don’t need to giveyou many statistics about prostate cancer. Most of you already know it: thirdleading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. Lots of risk factors, but there is agenetic predisposition to prostate cancer.For maybe about 10 percent of prostate cancer, there are folks that arepredisposed to it. And the first gene that was mapped in association studies forthis, early onset prostate cancer, was this gene called RNASE-L. What is this?It’s an anti-viral defense enzyme. So, we’re sitting around and thinking, “Whywould men who have this mutation—a defect in an antiviral defense system—getprostate cancer? It doesn’t make sense. Unless, maybe, there’s a virus?”So, we put tumors—and now we have over 100 tumors—on our array. And we knowwho’s got defects in RNASE-L and who doesn’t. And I’m showing you the signalfrom the chip here. And I’m showing you the block of retroviral oligos[oligonucleotides—short RNA or DNA molecules]. And what I’m telling you from thesignal, is that men who have a mutation in this antiviral defense enzyme, andhave a tumor, often have 40% of the time, a signature which reveals a newretrovirus . . .2 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn7_2]In my estimation, this was a tour de force of scientific investigation. Marrytechnology to knowledge of biology. This is how science is supposed to be done,an observation raises a question, an investigation is performed, and results areobtained.The observation was that the genetic defect found in men who were likely to haveearly-onset prostate cancer was a defect in a gene that created an antiviraldefense enzyme.The investigation involved putting more than a hundred of these tumors onDeRisi’s viral detection array and seeing what popped up.The results showed 40 percent of these tumors contained integrated sequences ofa mouse retrovirus.Science doesn’t get much cleaner than that.DeRisi continued:Okay, that’s pretty wild. What is it? So, we clone the whole virus. First ofall, I’ll tell you that a little automated prediction told us it was verysimilar to a mouse virus. But that doesn’t tell us too much, so we actuallycloned the whole thing. And the viral genome I’m showing you right here? It’s aclassic gamma retrovirus. But it’s totally new. No one’s ever seen it before.Its closest relative is, in fact, from mice. And so, we would call this axenotropic retrovirus because it’s infecting a species other than mice. And thisis a little phylogenetic tree to see how it’s related to other viruses. We’vedone it for many patients now, and we can say they’re all independentinfections.3 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn7_3]Silverman, DeRisi, and Gupta did not clone the whole virus in 2006 from a singlebiopsy. They actually cloned the virus from several different men’s biopsies,creating a hybrid, a Frankenstein virus, which never existed in humans.If they had told the truth in 2006, it would have been much more difficult todiscredit our work in 2011. We would never have included the PCR results in ourScience paper. The protein data, electron micrographs, and serology results fromour 2009 Science paper stand as truth to this day. Concealing the truth as theydid made the job of the bad guys so much easier.image [../Images/common.jpg]A typical retrovirus is eight thousand to ten thousand base pairs.The VP62 clone was created from tissue samples from three different patientsfrom which they had identified only about three hundred base pairs in theenvelope gene covering of the virus, and a couple hundred in the gag, or mainbody of the virus.How can a synthetic infectious molecular clone be used to characterize a newfamily of viruses when the sequence of that clone represents less than 10percent of the natural isolate?image [../Images/common.jpg]People often ask me what’s the difference between a typical virus and aretrovirus.The answer is simple.Many viruses are composed of DNA.A retrovirus is composed of RNA.But wait, you say to yourself, aren’t pretty much all living things based onDNA?The answer is, yes, they are.While nobody knows the answer, the current thinking is that RNA must have been aprecursor to DNA, used by the most primitive organisms at the very dawn of lifeon our planet. Nature, in her unparalleled efficiency, uses nucleic acidbuilding blocks RNA in DNA for essentially all organisms, but those pathogensthat are made of RNA, like retroviruses, need an enzyme to transform their RNAinto DNA and insert itself into the hosts’ DNA blueprint in order for the virusto survive. A retrovirus cannot live or replicate without using the machinery ofthe host cell.The enzyme retroviruses used to change their RNA into DNA is called reversetranscriptase. I consider the presence of reverse transcriptase in a disease tobe almost smoking-gun evidence of a retrovirus being involved.If you’re a retrovirus, there’s just one thing about reverse transcriptase.It’s an inefficient enzyme for copying your genetic code.Reverse transcriptase is prone to copying errors, causing retroviruses to easilymutate into viruses with wildly different genetic profiles. That means there canbe large variations between different strains of a single type of retrovirus.This trait of retroviruses made many scientists believe they could never causemuch harm to humans because they seemed to be, well, unstable. Since they areusually easily silenced and crippled, most have dismissed them as noninfectiousjunk DNA. That may be one reason John Coffin and Harold Varmus both told Franknot to bother looking for disease-causing human retroviruses.Retroviruses seemed like some biological relic of our far distant past,interesting in the way a platypus intrigues us with its combination of mammal,bird, and reptilian features.But HIV-AIDS was a wake-up call to the danger of retroviruses. They could bejust as dangerous as the typical virus. But HIV really was an outlier amongretroviruses. It killed its victims within a few years.HIV killed relatively quickly for a retrovirus. XMRVs disabled, keeping theirhosts alive, but in a state where they could generally not regain their health.image [../Images/common.jpg]My life has been about retroviruses since I entered Frank Ruscetti’s lab as atechnician on June 6, 1983. Frank and I always remember the date, as it was thesame date as the D-Day invasion of Europe during World War II.Teaching viruses how to thrive in cell culture has been my life since that dayin 1983. That’s thirty-seven years. And you must remember in those days beforeHIV-AIDS, Frank and Bernie Poiesz were the retrovirology super-stars sincethey’d isolated the very first cancer-causing human retrovirus, Human T-CellLeukemia Virus (HTLV-1). Bernie was an MD clinical fellow, and Frank wasBernie’s mentor. Robert Gallo was the lab chief, getting all the credit anddoing essentially none of the work.Now, HTLV-1 was endemic in Japan, so why did Frank and his team end up firstisolating the virus? It’s because Frank understood better than any person I’veever known how to use the cell lines to grow viruses and monitor that keyenzyme, reverse transcriptase. That’s where I learned how to grow viruses,because if you can’t grow these viruses, you can’t study them.The best tissue line to grow XMRVs was one called LNCaP (lymph node carcinoma ofthe prostate), which came from a sixty-two-year-old man whose prostate cancerhad spread to his lymph nodes. Why was this such a good cell line? One reason isthat it contained defective RNAse-L, the very enzyme that allowed theintegration of the sequences detected on the ViroChip.And it can’t really be said I’m somebody who’s against infectious molecularclones, since I helped construct the first infectious molecular clone of aHTLV-1 when I worked as a postdoc in the lab of Dave Derse from 1993 to 1994.Yes, that’s right, I’ve put together infectious molecular clones. I know theirstrengths and limitations.Because these viruses like to hide in tissues, they’re hard to isolate. Theyonly come out and can be found in the blood when the immune defenses of a personare near zero.You need cell lines to grow retroviruses, and you need to know what to use.I don’t want to get too technical, but I must explain something because I fearif I don’t, you’ll just think it’s beyond your understanding, and it’s not. So,Silverman and Gupta do their investigation, clipping off several geneticsequences of an XMRV, assembling something like three to four hundred base pairsof an estimated eight to ten thousand, and then they seal it up.Do you understand they’ve created something new?Something that never existed in nature?We used to call these clones Frankenstein viruses, stitched together out ofpieces and parts like that terrifying monster created by Dr. Frankenstein.Then they utilize a technology called “gene-walking,” working with enzymes,which do a much better job than reverse transcriptase has ever done in nature,and they make perfect little copies of themselves.An infectious molecular clone at best is a prototype of an actual virus, akin totaking a baseball and putting it in a copy machine and getting a two-dimensionalpicture of it. You wouldn’t take the copy of a baseball and hand it to thepitcher in the World Series.Everybody would laugh at you.But those ignorant of the biology, like critics Bridgette Huber and John Coffinof Tufts University, said it was just fine to use this inferior infectiousmolecular clone as a stand-in for natural isolates of XMRV. It’s like having ascrap from a treasure map with part of the journey, but you’re lacking the restof the map. Where’s the starting point? In a treasure map, the important part iswhere X marks the spot and you can find the hidden riches. In understanding avirus, you need the entire sequence.Natural isolates of XMRV are very slow growing. The VP62 infectious molecularclone is a nasty little beast, growing at fifteen to twenty times the rate ofnatural XMRVs, like an invasive weed.There is one way that XMRVs and VP62 are frighteningly similar.They could both become aerosolized, floating through the air like seeds from adandelion on a summer breeze. I have just described the nightmare scenario thatkeeps virologists awake at night. But there was one other problem that nobodyhad considered.If both XMRVs and VP62 could become airborne, we were also infecting our labworkers and scientists. When I began this investigation, I used the antibodytest on my blood and those of my collaborators. We were all negative.Now, I test positive for XMRV, as do many of my collaborators.image [../Images/common.jpg]In the wake of the July 22, 2009, meeting, prior to the world knowing about ourfindings in October of that year, the National Cancer Institute got down tobusiness. They wanted to get the jump on this thing. I commend them for beingproactive.There was just one problem.At that time, nobody had considered the possibility that XMRV, or its infectiousmolecular clone, VP62, could become airborne. But the data are all there. Labworkers used as controls were seropositive and contained proteins and immuneresponses. The big OMG at that meeting was this very realization that XMRVs weremore dangerous than HIV, as HIV never showed the ability to spread through theair.In building 535 of the National Cancer Institute, scientists set up twofermenters in the same room to grow cell lines generated by our team producingthe natural isolates of XMRVs and VP62. Now, I’ve told you that BOTH pathogenscan become airborne, but VP62 reproduces much more quickly.In 2009, we did not know this.In 2011, however, a team comprised of researchers led by Adi Gazdar from JohnsHopkins University, MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas, and theUniversity of Texas Southwestern Medical Center asked the question of whetherhuman tissue that had utilized mouse biological products in the culturingprocess might infect other samples, even though they’d never physically touched,in other words, whether the virus could become airborne.Six of 23 (26%) mouse DNA free xenograft cultures were strongly positive for MLVand their sequences had greater than 99% homology to known MLV strains. Four offive available supernatant fluids from these viral positive cultures werestrongly positive for RT [reverse transcriptase] activity. Three of thesesupernatant fluids were studied to confirm the infectivity of the releasedvirions for other human culture cells. Of the 78 non-xenograft derived celllines maintained in the xenograft culture containing facilities, 13 (17%) werepositive for MLV, including XMRV, a virus strain first identified in humantissues. By contrast, all 50 cultures maintained in a xenograft culture-freefacility were negative for viral sequences.4 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn7_4]In plain English, how bad were these findings? Let me break it down for you.First, if any mouse products were used in the development of a biologicalproduct, there was a 26 percent chance it was infected with a mouse leukemiavirus.Second, four out of five possible tests showed a high level of reversetranscriptase activity, meaning the virus was active.Third, if a tissue sample had never touched a mouse product, but was maintainedin a facility that did have such samples, there was a 17 percent chance thatthis mouse leukemia virus would find its way into the sample. Did it walk fromone sample to another on its little viral legs? I don’t think so. This wasevidence of airborne transmission.Fourth, if human cell lines were maintained in a facility without anymice-derived products, there was a 0 percent chance they would contain any mouseleukemia virus.And just in case we’d forgotten some of the basics, the authors were kind enoughto provide a little refresher for the casual reader:Retroviruses are enveloped viruses possessing an RNA genome and replicate via aDNA intermediate. Retroviruses rely on the enzyme reverse transcriptase toperform reverse transcriptase of its genome from RNA into DNA, which can then beintegrated into the host cell’s genome with an integrase enzyme. Retroviral DNAcan remain in a latent form in the genome (provirus) or its RNA can be expressedintermittently as infectious virions.5 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn7_5]The freak show continues. Retroviruses are made of RNA. In order to replicate inDNA organisms, they need reverse transcriptase. Once transcribed into DNA, theycan go into the genome of that organism and slumber for extended periods of timeor can, under the right circumstances, spew forth infectious particles.One would think this series of facts was worthy of a national emergency ratherthan trying to destroy our reputations and ignore the suffering of millionstoday and in the future.And my claim that we need to fear animal retroviruses jumping into the humanpopulation? Don’t take my word for it. Here’s what researchers from HarvardUniversity told the World Health Organization in a 2012 article that discussedthe risks of using animal tissue for medical purposes:Xenotransplantation is any procedure that involves the transplantation,implantation, or infusion into a human recipient of live cells, tissues, organsfrom an animal source. This definition may include human bodily fluids, cells,tissues, or organs that have had ex vivo [outside the body] contact with livenon-human animal cells, tissues, fluids, or organs. . . . As with any form oftransplantation, xenotransplantation carries the potential risk for transmissionof both known and unknown zoonotic infectious agents of animal origin into humanrecipients and into the wider human population.6 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn7_6]This is not a complicated proposition. All it says is when you mix animal andhuman tissue, there’s a risk that infectious agents present in the animals maycross over into the human cells. The viruses were likely dormant in the animal,but when put into humans, they may wake up and become active.We could also say there’s a risk that human pathogens could cross over into theanimal cells. What we’re doing is breaking down the barriers nature has erectedso that the pathogens of one species cannot be easily transferred to humanityand vice versa. We’re like children playing with matches and gasoline, hoping wedon’t burn down the planet.And as for my specific fear that retroviruses from animals will cross over intothe human population? Honestly, I don’t know why scientists like me are treatedas purveyors of panic when you can go into scientific journals and read thesethings for yourself:Concern about retroviral transmission in xenotransplantation relates to thepotential for “silent” transmission, that is, unapparent infection that maycause altered gene regulation, oncogenesis, or recombination. No exogenousviruses, equivalent to HTLV or HIV, have been found in pigs. However, endogenousretroviruses (part of the germline DNA) have been demonstrated in all mammalianspecies to date. Endogenous retroviruses that are infectious for human cells invitro have been detected in many species, including baboons (BaEV), cats(RD114), mice (murine ERV), and pigs (PERV).7 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn7_7]Does that last paragraph cause you to lose sleep? It should. In effect it saysthat retroviruses can affect you in ways that are different from those normallyassociated with your typical virus.Transmission is “silent,” meaning your body’s immune system is not alerted tofight this invader. The pathogen could be said to be “stealth” like a B-1 bomberwith radar cloaking and deflecting materials and angles. As if that’s notterrifying enough, once established in your body, our little retrovirus will getbusy changing your gene expression in unpredictable ways, promoting thedevelopment of cancer (oncogenesis) or recombining with other pathogens in yourbody to create new monsters.There you find yourself at the doctor’s office one day with some funky disease,and your physician is scratching his head as he looks over your results, saying,“Well, you’ve got something that is kind of like X and kind of like Y. Let’sjust call it idiopathic X and Y disease.” After that doctor visit, you go to thedictionary because you don’t know what “idiopathic” is and you find it means “ofunknown origin” and you think to yourself, “Maybe my doctor’s the idiot.”How can these people not know?Where’s the slightest bit of scientific curiosity?image [../Images/common.jpg]Let’s talk about Silverman’s VP62 molecular infectious clone. When Frank and Iworked with it, we estimated the VP62 infectious molecular clone grew fifteen totwenty times more quickly than natural isolates of XMRVs. Frank was terrified bythis finding, and little terrifies him. Even Ebola didn’t concern Frank as muchas Silverman’s VP62 clone.Silverman and Gupta created something that had never previously existed innature. Is it any surprise that when they told labs like Abbott to create a testbased on their VP62 plasmid, they weren’t able to find anything like it in theirpatients?And so, if you have one fermenter in a room at the National Cancer Institutewith XMRV and another with the VP62, what do you think is going to happen? Whowins that evolutionary struggle? We know that XMRVs can become airborne becauseof the Adi Gazdar paper I cited earlier. Wouldn’t the man-made XMRV called VP62do the same thing?Let’s say we have transmission going both ways. The fermenter with XMRVcontaminates the VP62 and vice versa. But since VP62 grows so much more quickly,it will easily wipe out any traces of natural XMRVs or, worse yet, recombine tocreate new Frankenstein XMRVs.image [../Images/common.jpg]We never had VP62 in our WPI labs, which is why we were able to get accurateresults, free of any VP62 contamination. Our cultures were contaminated in theNCI labs, and we proved it by single cell cloning patient samples, which Ishowed in that September 22, 2011, debate.I was always trained to keep the samples separate, in case of just such anoccurrence.I have a good deal of sympathy for those who were upset that Silverman’s VP62synthetic infectious molecular clone contaminated their lab, like itcontaminated those in building 535 of the National Cancer Institute.In Silverman’s defense, he did not know that the VP62 synthetic infectiousmolecular clone could become airborne when he created it in 2006. We onlylearned that in 2011, five years later.However, the VP62 plasmid contamination issue has nothing to do with thequestion of whether XMRVs are infecting the human population.image [../Images/common.jpg]“Joy really feels bad about all this,” Silverman said to Frank Rusectti at abreak during the 15th International Conference on Human Retrovirology, HTLV, andRelated Viruses, held in Leuven, Belgium, June 4–8, 2011. “Joy” referred to J.Das Gupta, Silverman’s research partner.What Joy felt bad about was the fact that they’d taken sequences from threedifferent patients to create their infectious molecular clone, which clearlymeant they did not have an accurate sequence of our XMRVs that they contaminatedwith their VP62. Yet they reported their sequences as “highly similar” tonatural isolates of XMRV in our Science paper. They felt bad about it? If theyfelt so bad, why did they wait to tell us until the summer of 2011? To this daythey let me take the fall, knowing full well that countless lab workers,including me, were being infected and are now developing devastating neuroimmunedisorders and cancers. I am infected, and many of my former colleagues are, aswell. All because the government was not interested in retrofitting laboratoriesto Biosafety Level-3 precautions, the same safety standard used for HIV. Animalcaretakers and student lab technicians are also being injured from thisnegligence.These cowards simply ignored the multiple lines of evidence we had from thebeginning showing our data was not the result of VP62 contamination.Foremost among that evidence was Frank’s presentation titled “Development ofXMRV Producing B Cell Lines from Lymphomas from Patients with Chronic FatigueSyndrome.” We had theorized that one of the long-term effects of viral infectionwould be an increased rate of cancer, specifically B-cell lymphoma, otherwiseknown as Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Among the general population, the rate ofnon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma was 0.02 percent, but among sufferers of ME/CFS, the ratewas close to 5 percent. Frank had written in his presentation:Additionally, development of cancer coincides with an outgrowth of gamma delta Tcells with specific clonal T-cell receptor gamma. We hypothesized that infectionwith XMRV and/or other viruses can trigger a dysregulated immune response, whichfavors the development of B-cell lymphoma.8 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn7_8]It was one thing to claim that VP62 had contaminated various research labs; itwas quite another to claim it had found its way into long-time sufferers ofME/CFS. Harvey Alter’s work, especially, disproved this idea, as his samples hadbeen collected in the mid-1980s, prior to the creation of VP62 in 2006.Similarly, John Coffin’s idea that the recombination to create XMRV had happenedin a lab at Case Western University in the 1990s also did not make any sense. Ifsimply culturing viruses could generate infectious recombinants in two weeks(reverse transcriptase was actually detected after ten days), how could Coffinproclaim in 2013 that XMRV was a freak of nature, a once-in-creation occurrenceso fantastical we might as well call it the “immaculate recombination.” If ithappened once in a culture, it could easily happen again.Silverman wanted to be done with the issue and was against letting Frank and medo the necessary testing to determine whether VP62 had somehow found its wayinto our samples. On July 7, 2011, Frank sent a scathing email to Silverman:Dear Bob:I find your answer disingenuous to say the least. The source of contamination isof interest to us, but having that answer will not change the fact that Fig. 1is erroneous. (italics added) Depending on the source of contamination, it willdetermine whether all the figures or just fig. 1 is discredited. All statementsin this field about contamination pinpoint the problem, science demands that wedo so also. We may never figure out the source of the contamination, but we needto make public aware that the interpretation of figure 1 is just plain wrong.(italics added) The reality is since the publication of the paper in 2009 nobodyhas believed fig 1 is correct so why the rush to publish before doing theexperiments we suggest. Second, we all suspect (you may already know thus thecomment you said to me in Belgium that Joy feels awful about it) the source ofcontamination is your lab . . .9 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn7_9]Is all of this becoming clear?Silverman had put together a synthetic, this VP62 molecular clone, which wasfine as a prototype to possibly help us understand things about the virus. Theproblem was he didn’t tell us he took pieces from three different viruses and itwasn’t even close to a fully sequenced eight to ten thousand base pairs of thevirus.Using that crappy clone, they developed all these crappy tests.As the programmers like to say, “Garbage in, garbage out.”When we did our initial tests, we saw that the PCR was overlapping in two keyvirus regions, but the bands were different sizes. If the bands were differentsizes, it meant there were different nucleic acids in our strains. Yes, we hadsomething close to Silverman’s virus, a different strain, or so we thought atthe time.Let me tell you a difference between Frank Ruscetti, Judy Mikovits, and RobertSilverman.Frank and I have the courage and integrity to publish all the data, even thepart that might not make sense at the time. Not only did Robert Silverman nothave the integrity or courage to admit the mistakes made in his laboratory, buthe has done nothing for nearly a decade as my career was ruined and millionshave continued to suffer and die.Figure 1 of our original Science paper was a picture of the PCR positives in ourstudy based on Silverman’s VP62 clone. These were the patient samples that weresupposedly PCR positive for the virus we isolated. It was the basis of the titlesaying it was XMRV based on Silverman’s strain. Figure 3 supports that withprotein proof detected with antibodies, e.g., 1118, clearly negative by PCR andprotein positive in figure 3.Why would the PCR variations matter when we know that HIV has more than ahundred strains? We had the antibody and proteins that showed these isolateswere the true XMRVs.Was there really anything else that mattered?I think what really mattered is that our guardians of public health simplydidn’t want to admit the terrible problem they’d created.And the unique characteristics of VP62, its ability to become airborne andquickly overgrow the XMRV virus from which it had been created, made it theperfect assassin for my career and the lives of millions who would continue tosearch for answers."},{"pageContent":"images [../Images/line.jpg]CHAPTER EIGHTMy Identity Stolen in Vaccine Courtimages [../Images/line.jpg]In George Orwell’s classic dystopian novel 1984, there’s a process by which anenemy of the state is expunged from memory. It’s called becoming an “unperson,”and Big Brother will simply wipe away all traces of your existence. Thepopulation has learned not to question the sudden disappearance of people, orradical changes of government policy, such as abrupt changes of alliance in anendless war. One day the bitter, longtime enemy will be East-Asia and the nextday it will be Eurasia, and the government authorities will pronounce East-Asiahas always been the longtime ally. There must forever be an enemy to hate, andthe vague fear that if one doesn’t behave according to written and unwrittengovernment dictates, you’ll wake to find you’ve been erased from memory.At the start of my journey in 2009, I didn’t realize I was an unconsciousfollower of the government and scientific propaganda regarding vaccines. Inretrospect, I should have questioned more. But I find that most of those who nowfind themselves on the so-called “anti-vax” side started off in much the sameway.I was simply following well-established clinical practice when I mentioned on aNevada television show in 2009 that if a retrovirus was involved in ME/CFS andautism, we should treat it with the same precautions we did an HIV infection.XMRV might not be a killer like HIV, but it certainly did a lot of damage. Anyimmune stimulation could cause the virus to replicate out of control, causing itto go from a virus that the immune system had silenced to one that was rampagingthrough the body. Children born to HIV-positive mothers immediately go onantiretroviral therapy prior to any immunizations.I did not expect the vicious response that followed that TV show.Maybe you think I should have taken a hint and stopped talking about it.Did Columbus stop talking about the Earth being round when he met opposition?Did Galileo stop talking about the Earth revolving around the sun when theclergy told him he was contradicting the Bible?Scientists aren’t worried about their popularity. They worry if their ideas aretrue.When nobody was able to give us a good explanation as to why we shouldn’t followsimilar precautions with XMRV as we did with HIV, we followed the most stringentof safety precautions and kept investigating.A scientist knows that a good question leads to other questions.As I’ve said before, that question led me to more fully understand the threatposed by using animal tissues in medical products. I also began to understandthe simple question I’d asked could also be asked of many of the products usedin vaccines and other medical products.If science had missed this problem, as we’d missed the problem with lead ingasoline and other products for many years, I wondered why the legal system hadnot taken on this challenge.I was about to get an education as to how the pharmaceutical industry hadintervened in our laws to make sure a strong case would never be made againstvaccines.Vaccines would be touted as such a shining example of scientific progress thathard questions about them could never be asked in a regular courtroom.image [../Images/common.jpg]As a scientist, I’m a big fan of data and evidence.If you pose a hypothesis, a scientist proves or disproves it with data.Honestly, that’s how some of the greatest discoveries are made. Two statementsof alleged fact are made, but they can’t be reconciled. It’s the apparentmistakes, or the two things that can’t both be true, that draw our attention.Here are two things that cannot both be true:Vaccines are as safe as sugar water.Vaccines carry such risk that nobody is liable for injury.Claims may only be brought in a special court, where the parents ofvaccine-injured children face off against Department of Justice attorneys. Thisspecial “Vaccine Court” was established by law under the 1986 National ChildhoodVaccine Injury Act.Many of you are probably learning about this court for the first time. The Actremoves liability from pharmaceutical companies for any injuries or deathscaused by their childhood vaccines. It also only allows discovery ofpharmaceutical company documents with the approval of the court. This isdramatically different from the typical products liability action in which thecompany must turn over all relevant documents. In addition, each case is unique,meaning that if a vaccine has been found to cause a certain injury in one case,that cannot be relied upon in any way in a subsequent case.In addition, parents may not seek documents on the safety of vaccines from thecompanies that produced them, unless given specific permission from the court.And if one parent is successful in making a claim of harm from a certainvaccine, that information is then hidden from others who want to make a similarclaim.If vaccines were as safe as sugar water, then there would be no need for such asystem.Is there a soda court, where claims against soft drinks are made, defended byDepartment of Justice attorneys?image [../Images/common.jpg]Kent and I have done extensive research into this so-called “Vaccine Court,” andI’ll briefly recap what we’ve found.The truth is that vaccines are so dangerous that the liability from one shot,that earlier version of the DPT shot for which my attorney Mike Hugo worked somagnificently, was so great that the pharmaceutical companies didn’t want toface such scenarios in the future.One of the experts Kent interviewed was Stanford Law professor Nora FreemanEngstrom. Professor Engstrom is one of the few academics who has examined thechain of events that led to the formation of the court in 1986 as well as howthe court has functioned in the ensuing decades.Engstrom reviewed the case of Anita Reyes, a young girl living near the Mexicoborder in the 1970s who contracted polio as a result of a dose of a WyethLaboratories polio vaccine. The case that resulted, Reyes v. Wyeth, heard in theFifth Circuit, suggested that between victims and vaccine manufacturers, themanufacturers should bear the loss.1 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn8_1]The loss in the Reyes case was followed by a series of calamities for thevaccine makers. Forty-five million Americans took a defective Swine Flu vaccinein 1976, with several hundred developing Guillain-Barré syndrome and suing fortheir injuries. The DPT vaccine that Mike Hugo had been attacking became a majorsource of liability for the vaccine makers. As Stanford Law professor Engstromdetailed in a later article:As the number of lawsuits ticked upwards, so did the manufacturers’ dismay. In1984, for example, Lederle’s President went on record declaring that “[t]hepresent dollar demand of DTP lawsuits against Lederle is 200 times greater thanour total sales of DTP vaccine in 1983.” . . . Another vaccinemanufacturer—Connaught Laboratories—faced a similar plight, as suits filedagainst it in 1985 and 1986 sought a combined billion dollars in damages.2[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn8_2]The two main justifications for creating a “Vaccine Court” were to speed theprocess along so that the parents of a vaccine-injured family could quicklyreceive their money and to remove the antagonism so often present in personalinjury cases against a large corporation.The US Government Accountability Office (GAO) looked at the program and foundthat both parents and those who administer the program had come to similarconclusions about the problems with the Vaccine Court:While [the Program] was expected to provide compensation for vaccine-relatedinjuries quickly and easily, these expectations have “often not been met.” Aleader in the parents’ lobby, instrumental in the Act’s passage, has concludedthat the VICP’s administration has constituted a “betrayal of the promise thatwas made to parents about how the compensation program would be implemented.”And the man who served for over two decades as the VICP’s chief special master,has publicly lamented: [L]itigating causation cases has proven the antithesis ofCongress’ desire for the program.”3 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn8_3]Kent and I try to cover our bases. Not only did he interview one of the fewlegal academics who has looked at the workings of the Vaccine Court, but he alsointerviewed the former chief special master of the program for more than twodecades, Gary Golkiewicz.The chief special master of the Vaccine Court is equivalent to the chief justiceof the United States Supreme Court.As of this writing, the Vaccine Court has paid out more than four billiondollars in claims to children who have been injured by vaccines.image [../Images/common.jpg]Kent found the former chief special master, Gary Golkiewicz, surprisingly opento sharing his experiences. When asked about how the program could have beenbetter, Golkiewicz had strong opinions.“We’re operating today with an Act designed to handle the DTP shortage, which weno longer even give. The original Act had I believe six vaccines, but now Ithink we’re up to eighteen or nineteen. So that original language is beingapplied to the HPV [Human Papilloma Virus] vaccine and also the flu vaccine,which is the number one source for work in the program. And it’s not effective.And that’s what’s causing all the frustration from the parents’ side, which isabsolutely correct. The argument that the program takes too long, it’s toolitigious, and it’s not quick justice is correct. There’s a tie-up in the courtsright now. They expected a hundred and fifty cases a year and last year they hadover nine hundred.”4 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn8_4]Kent brought up the challenging question of whether the alleged concealment ofvital information from the Vaccine Court, such as the Simpsonwood Conference of2000 and cover-up of Generation Zero data on mercury exposure, the allegationsof destruction of data in 2004 by CDC scientist, Dr. William Thompson regardingthe MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine and autism, and the 2009 embezzlementcharges against Dr. Paul Thorsen, one of the main authors on several studiesshowing no link between vaccines and autism. To his credit, Golkewicz did notduck the question.“I would say this in answer to your question,” said the former chief specialmaster. “The special master, like any judge, relies upon information. If thatinformation is not correct, it would obviously impact the information the judgeis considering and could potentially impact his decision. In that respect, thespecial masters are no different than any other judge. Your decision is only asgood as the information you get.”5 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn8_5]The question that is raised, but not answered, is who controls the informationgiven to the Vaccine Court.I was going to get an education on how these gatekeepers of information actedwhen qualified scientists stepped up as expert witnesses addressing vaccinesafety in the Vaccine Court.I would not be impressed with what I learned. In fact, I am outraged.image [../Images/common.jpg]It’s probably important we spend a brief amount of time explaining theSimpsonwood Conference of June 7 and 8, 2000. Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. did amasterful job explaining what happened in a June 16, 2005, article in RollingStone and Salon titled “Deadly Immunity.” My coauthor spent an entire chapter onthe conference in his fine book, INOCULATED: How Science Lost its Soul inAutism.Fifty-three individuals met at the Simpsonwood Conference Center over theweekend of June 7 and 8, 2000, to discuss troubling findings regarding mercuryand aluminum in the new vaccine schedule and the link that kept coming up in thedata that the more vaccines you gave a child, the more likely they were to havea neurological problem.In science, this is known as a “clue,” which is likely to help you betterunderstand an issue.The meeting was chaired by Dr. Walter Orenstein, who at the time was director ofthe National Immunization Program at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Ofthe fifty-three individuals present, fifteen were members of the CDC. There werefourteen individuals with academic appointments, but who also often hadoverlapping advisory roles with certain public health agencies. Twelveindividuals directly represented the National Immunization Program. Five wererepresentatives of the vaccine companies. Four were representatives of theNational Academy of Pediatrics. Three individuals were not medical doctors:Paula Ray, the project manager for the Northern California Kaiser Vaccine StudyCenter; Ned Lewis, the data manager for the Kaiser group; and Wendy Heaps, thehealth communication specialist for the National Immunization Program. Twoindividuals represented state health agencies, and two represented foreignentities, specifically the European Agency for the Evaluation of MedicinalProducts and probably the most eminent member of the group, Dr. John Clements,who represented the World Health Organization (WHO).In looking at the data they’d assembled, both for what they were able toconclude about mercury exposure and the related question of what they didn’tunderstand about the use of aluminum salts, lead study author Thomas Verstraetensummarized the findings:The bottom line to me is you can look at this data and turn it around and lookat this, and add this stratum, I can come up with risks very high. I can come upwith risks very low, depending on how you turn everything around. You make it goaway for some and then it comes back for others. If you make it go away here, itwill pop up again there. So, the bottom signal is, okay, our signal will not goaway . . .Personally, I have three hypotheses. My first hypothesis is it is parental bias.The children that are more likely to be vaccinated are more likely to be pickedup and diagnosed. Second hypothesis, I don’t know. There is a bias I have notyet recognized, and nobody has yet told me about it. Third hypothesis, it’strue, it’s thimerosal. [mercury]6 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn8_6]Let’s put the best face possible on this assessment. They were noticing aneffect and didn’t know if it was real. I think you could make the argument thatif the information wasn’t clear, they didn’t want to panic the public oversomething that might end up being false.However, at the very least, if you had the slightest concern for the safety ofthe public, you’d want to know if you were harming children, wouldn’t you? Butthat doesn’t seem to have been the consensus of public health officials andmembers of the pharmaceutical industries. The dominant view was expressed by Dr.John Clements, who, given his position at the World Health Organization, waslikely to command the most respect. In his summation, Clements said:It has been a great privilege to listen to the debate and to hear everybody workthrough with enormous detail. And I want to congratulate, as others have done,the work that has been done by the team. Then comes the BUT. I am reallyconcerned that we have taken off like a boat going down one arm of the mangroveswamp at high speed, when in fact there was no discussion early on about whichway the boat should go at all. And I really want to risk offending everybody inthis room by saying that perhaps this study should not have been done at all.Because the outcome of it could have, to some extent, been predicted. And wehave all reached this point now where we are leg hanging, even though I hear themajority of the consultants say to the board that they are not convinced thereis a causality direct link between thimerosal and various neurological outcomes.I know how we handle it from here is extremely problematic.7[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn8_7]Are you reading his summation the same way I am? That maybe this is a study thatshould not have been done? In my entire life I’ve never known a scientist toargue against obtaining knowledge.And it isn’t the harm to children he’s worried about, but how this informationcan be managed. Honestly, it seems they’ve done a pretty good job of managingthe information in the nearly two decades since that meeting was held.My coauthor, Kent, isn’t surprised at what’s happened to me over the years.“They knew somebody like you would eventually come along, Judy,” he says.“Somebody who wouldn’t be bullied, no matter what they did, and wouldn’t giveup.”Maybe that’s true, but it makes me sad.I’d grown up respecting the honesty and integrity of scientists involved inpublic health.image [../Images/common.jpg]I was asked to work as an expert witness in the vaccine court by severallongtime vaccine court attorneys. In 2015, Frank and I formed a consultingcompany, Mikovits and Ruscetti Consulting, Inc., or M.A.R.C. Inc. In one of ourinteractions with the court, Frank and I were asked to describe our background.We wrote:Drs. Mikovits and Ruscetti changed the practice of immunology and medicinearguably more than any two individuals since 1980. As pioneers in translationalmedicine, we have worked our entire careers together in teams with MDs, nurses,nurse practitioners, Ph.Ds. Our passion throughout our careers is to worktogether to translate discoveries as rapidly as possible and free from bias andconflicts of interest which is why we succeeded. It is because of this approachand our discoveries as part of these teams, we changed the paradigm oftreatments not only for HIV/AIDS but also for cancer, autoimmune disease andneuroimmune disease (Autism, ME/CFS, MS. ALS etc.) Our discoveries andtreatments based on them and developed by our teams are credited with savingmillions of lives. We have highlighted some examples as they address questions10–14 regarding the source of our knowledge of vaccine manufacturing, itscontaminants and the immune related adverse events associated with vaccinecomponents, excipients and contaminants.8 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn8_8]These are some of the accomplishments we listed for Frank, who for thirty-nineyears worked at the very center of government science investigating humanhealth:• In 1978, Dr. Ruscetti’s team discovered interleukin 2, then called T-CellGrowth factor.• Dr. Ruscetti’s team received an award from the society for immunotherapy incancer for interleukin 2. It was a team award for MDs and PhDs who collaboratedon the first clinical trials.• In 1980, Dr. Ruscetti’s team isolated the first pathogenic human retrovirusHTLV-1, which is the causative agent of adult T cell leukemia and associatedwith autoimmunity, acquired immune deficiencies, and cancer.• Dr. Ruscetti’s teams also discovered additional pathways of immunepathogenesis and the molecules that regulate these pathways including IL-5 andIL-15. These discoveries were key to the understanding of T-cell immunology,cytokine regulation of inflammation, and efficacy and toxicity of immunetherapy.• Dr. Ruscetti’s teams paper on T cell growth was awarded the AmericanAssociation of Immunologists second most important publication of the firsthundred years of publication.• In that same time frame, Dr. Ruscetti developed a cell line from a patientwith acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). This allowed the demonstration thatseveral biological agents could induce complete differentiation of APL. Retinoicacid induced differentiation became the standard of care.• Dr. Ruscetti’s teams first associated HTLV-1 with Adult T cell leukemia (ATL)in 1980. For this, we received an award for the “Development in the field ofHuman Retrovirology” from the International Retrovirology Association andrecognized as coauthor of one of the top thirty papers published in the hundredyears of the National Academy of Sciences.• In 1991 Dr. Ruscetti was awarded the NIH [National Institutes of Health]Distinguished Service Award “in recognition of fundamental co-discoveries ofinterleukin-2, the first human leukemia virus, and for the discovery ofhematopoietic regulatory activities of transforming growth factor beta.”As for me, I had a similar list of accomplishments.• Dr. Mikovits was part of the team in 1980 who purified interferon alpha. Itwas this interferon alpha which was the first immune therapy for cancer, acurative therapy for hairy cell leukemia.• In 1986 Mikovits took a job at Upjohn Pharmaceuticals in Kalamazoo, Michigan.The goal of her project was to provide experimentation demonstrating that theGMO bovine growth hormone did not harm human cells. (It did.) A second projectwith Dr. Ruscetti involved proving if Upjohn’s biological drug known as ATGAM(made with human blood) was contaminated with HIV. The manufacturing process didinactivate HIV, thus removing the risk of HIV transmission.• Mikovits was awarded graduate student of the year in 1991. This work changedthe paradigm of HIV/AIDS treatment and has saved millions. It also showed thatHIV does NOT CAUSE AIDS because a genetically resistant person can be infectedwith HIV and never develop AIDS. It was the immune response to HIV, not theinfection, that caused the damage.• In 1992 Mikovits and Ruscetti began a collaboration with Stephen B. Baylin,MD, of Johns Hopkins University to understand how retroviruses dysregulate theDNA methylation machinery. This seminal 1998 publication directly impactedtherapeutic protocols for AIDS and cancer, showing how retroviruses dysregulatecellular gene expression. Publication took four years because it went againstall known dogma. A key aspect of this work was the discovery that infectiousvirus was NOT required to dysregulate DNA methylation.• Between 1994 and 1998 we published data showing that the inflammatory pathwayNFKB was dysregulated by HIV infection. Again, this discovery made no sensegiven the dogma of the time concerning these two pathways.• In 1999, Dr. Mikovits was appointed director of the Lab of Anti-Viral DrugMechanisms in the Developmental Therapeutics program of the National CancerInstitute. The goal of the lab was to develop therapeutics for AIDS-associatedmalignancies.• Dr. Mikovits and her team worked in collaboration with Lou Staudt, MD, PhD,who pioneered the development of gene expression profiling technology to definemolecular subtypes of lymphoma for targeted therapies.• In May 2001, Dr. Mikovits left the National Cancer Institute to work atEpiGenX in Santa Barbara, CA, and direct their Cancer Biology program and wasnamed chief scientific officer in 2005. This program developed and implementedhigh throughput screening technologies for the diagnosis and treatment ofcancers caused by the dysregulation of DNA methylation machinery byenvironmental toxins and retroviruses. The company was acquired in 2006 by alarge pharmaceutical company that still uses the drugs Mikovits developed.• In 2006, Dr. Mikovits designed and developed the research program of the firstneuroimmune institute in the world at the University of Nevada (Reno), using asystems biology translational/team approach.• In 2009, Drs. Mikovits and Ruscetti were part of a team in collaboration withthe Cleveland Clinic who isolated a new family of retroviruses then called XMRVand associated then with chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis(CFS/ME). This work was published in the journal Science.Certainly, our combination of nearly sixty years’ experience in governmentscientific research should be enough to qualify us to offer a medical opinion onwhether an individual has suffered a vaccine injury. In answer to a questionposed specifically about vaccines and what might be some misconceptions amongthe general public, we explained our opinion that:Vaccines are immunotherapy and carry the same risks of immune-related adverseeffects as other biological drugs and immunotherapies. Our work changedtreatment paradigms of acquired immune deficiencies and cancer by defining atthe molecular level genetic and epigenetically susceptible populations (that is,those most likely to suffer Immune Related Adverse Events (IRAE). The lay persondoesn’t appreciate that vaccines are not single-ingredient pure (antigen only)drugs, but rather multi-ingredient preparations specifically designed tointensively challenge the immune system in the manner of an actual disease.Contaminants from the manufacturing process (called excipients, CDC Excipienttable 2 EXH5) that are not removed by the manufacturing process and remain inthe vaccine in significant amounts.9 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn8_9]My coauthor, Kent, is always telling me I need to simplify things and break itdown so that the lay reader may more clearly understand my points. But realizethat to me, the above paragraph is perfectly clear.Vaccines work by stimulating the immune system. We understand that stimulatingthe immune system is a way in which we might treat cancer. However, when weinvestigate immunotherapies for cancer, we’re carefully monitoring the responseof the immune system to our interventions.However, with vaccines we’ve been stimulating the immune systems of individualsfor the better part of a century with virtually NO monitoring of how theirimmune system is responding.Each intervention increases the likelihood of an adverse event.Increase the number of interventions/vaccines, and you dramatically raise thelikelihood of adverse reactions. That’s simple logic. Add to that complexity thefact that vaccines contain multiple ingredients, and you realize what a shakyfoundation upon which we’ve built our current medical system.Further in the document Frank and I noted:MMR, polio, and varicella are live attenuated vaccines. The contaminants andexcipients include human MRC5 cells, Human WI-38 lung cells, monkey kidneycells, guinea pig cell cultures and bovine serum. Live viral vaccines are allgrown in human and animal cells lines and these animal and human cell linescontain human and animal retroviruses (adventitious agents which can recombineto generate new infectious retroviruses during the manufacture.) In addition tothe animal and human retroviral contaminants, the carcinogen formaldehyde,antibiotics which dysregulate the GI [gastro-intestinal] and nasopharyngalmicrobiomes, glutamate, and bio-incompatible contaminants including nickel andchromium (EXH 6) can synergize in toxicity and the development ofneuroinflammatory, neurodegenerative and neuroimmune diseases and cancer whichcan become clinically apparent decades later.10 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn8_10]Let’s talk about what’s become clear to me about vaccines. The vaccines containhuman cells, specifically MRC5 and WI-38 cells, from aborted babies.My friend, the late Dr. Jeff Bradstreet, was extremely concerned that injectinghuman DNA into the bloodstream of children would eventually integrate into theDNA of those children and cause damage. Dr. Theresa Deisher, who obtained herPhD in molecular and cellular physiology from Stanford University and hastwenty-three patents to her name, also has similar concerns and has testifiedabout them.For many it is a moral issue to use aborted human fetal tissue, but also ascientific problem. The fact is we do not know the long-term consequences ofinjecting human DNA into the bloodstream of young children (or adults, for thatmatter). If the human DNA also contains or activates latent retroviruses, thesecan also generate reverse transcriptase, which will allow for geneticrearrangement, which we know promotes the development of cancer.Here is a section of testimony given by Dr. Deisher at Georgetown University inSeptember of 2008:How might the human DNA contaminated vaccines contribute to human disease?First, there is the potential for the contaminating DNA to be mixed with our owngenes by a process called homologous recombination. Homologous recombination isan established biologic phenomenon in which a segment of a cell’s DNA issubstituted by another segment of DNA that is similar. This can occur duringcell division or DNA repair.Homologous recombination occurs naturally to create genetic diversity in ouroffspring and is also conveniently harnessed by scientists to introduceexperimental DNA into cells or animals. We do not yet know if this occurs withthe contaminating human DNA found in some of our vaccines, and if so, to whatextent. Imagine the potential consequences of human DNA from a vaccine, avaccine that is given to children at an average age of 15 months, beingincorporated into a child’s developing brain. One does not need to be a rocketscientist to know that this potential has to be studied.In addition to the potential for homologous recombination, DNA is known to be apowerful immune stimulant. Diseases like graft versus host, juvenile (type I)diabetes, multiple sclerosis, lupus and some forms of arthritis are what arecalled auto-immune diseases. These are diseases driven by immune attack from ourown immune system on our own organs, a system normally responsible to attackinvading bacteria and pathogens. Targeted self-destruction, if you will.Science does not yet know, except for graft versus host disease, what triggersthe auto-immune attack. We certainly lack studies that have examined therelationship between immune responses to human DNA containing vaccines andauto-immune diseases.11 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn8_11]We’ll leave aside for the moment the moral issue of using aborted human fetaltissue. There are likely to be significant biological problems from the use ofthis tissue.When we move to the animals, the problem becomes much worse. We know withscientific certainty that one of the most destructive factors in human historyis the jumping of animal viruses into humans. The Pulitzer Prize-winning authorJared Diamond in his book Guns, Germs, and Steel makes the argument that thereason European contact with Native Americans was so devastating is that we hadbecome infected with viruses from our domesticated animals. These came from ourhorses, our cows, our goats, our dogs, and maybe the rats that bred in our urbanareas, especially combined with the fact we lived in large, concentrated citieswith poor sanitation.That’s a perfect recipe for disease creation.Therefore, we had a group of disease-carrying Europeans arriving on Americanshores with superior weaponry against a population with none of theseadvantages.I make the case that what we have done in the laboratory mimics the worst ofwhat happened in European populations and animals in the Middle Ages and thentraveled across the ocean. The sad possibility is that our children andimmune-compromised are the Native Americans in this scenario.We are mixing animal and human tissue in laboratory cultures, then injectingthem into human beings in a way that bypasses their traditional defenses, suchas stomach acid breaking down pathogens. Antibiotics, which we give withalarming regularity, are known to dysregulate the bacteria in our digestivesystem, and there’s strong evidence of harm from many of the chemicals used invaccines.I understand that to many my concerns might be the first time they’ve consideredthem. However, on consideration of what I’ve proposed, have I said anything thatseems to be unsupported by the scientific facts?Have I made a single remark that convinces you my opinion should not be heard ina courtroom and the truth or falsity of it considered?image [../Images/common.jpg]In the cases Frank and I worked on in vaccine court we reviewed injuries otherthan autism. One of them was the progression of a young child’s juvenilediabetes.In a letter to the attorney in charge this case, Frank wrote:I previously submitted a report in this case, which supported your petitionclaim that DTaP vaccination administered on February 14, 2013 “significantlyaggravated J.B.’s underlying genetic autoimmune susceptibility causing thedevelopment of T1DM [type 1 diabetes mellitus] that but for the vaccine wouldprobably never have happened.” My original report highlighted my 40 years oftranslational research expertise beginning with the discovery of severalcytokines and their signaling pathways key to the development of the adaptiveimmune response and the mechanisms of pathogenesis of dysregulation of thebalance between the innate and adaptive immune response to infection in thedevelopment of chronic inflammatory, autoimmune, and cancer.As I wrote in my original report, “we have learned the immune system is notstatic, it changes with age according to environmental toxins, infections, andvaccinations. Vaccines are immunotherapy. That is, they are designed to alterthe immune response to an antigen/infection. We have long recognized that thereasons some individuals react badly to immunotherapies, including vaccines,while the majority of people who are treated/vaccinated do not, has much to dowith the recipient’s genetics and the status of the recipient’s health andimmune system at the time of administration of the immunotherapy/vaccination.”12[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn8_12]In another case Frank and I reviewed the case of a thirteen-year-old young womanwho appeared to suffer from postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS)caused by an HPV (human papilloma virus) vaccine and a hepatitis A shot. (Sinceshe is a minor, she is simply referred to by her initials, CM.) POTS is acondition in which otherwise healthy individuals find that upon standing theysuffer from dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting, and tunnel vision. Testinggenerally shows an abnormal heart rate upon standing, showing a clear biologicalbasis for the condition. A 2012 Mayo Clinic review listed vaccines as a possiblecause of the condition.In our report we wrote:CM was a healthy 13-year-old training for a triathlon at the time she wasvaccinated with HPV and Hepatitis A vaccine simultaneously on March 20, 2013.Five weeks later CM experienced severe migraine headaches and a syncope eventwhich was distinct from the two previous events in its duration and severity.Quoting Rule 4 Document 15 at 7 “On January 9, 2014 CM reported to Dr. [nameremoved] for abdominal pain. Dr. [name removed] noted that prior to May 2013, CMhad minor syncopal episodes which became significant in May, during which timeshe had complete loss of consciousness for 20–30 minutes and became bradycardiacand hypoxic with abnormal eye movements.”At that time five weeks after the administration of the HPV and Hepatitis Avaccines CM was diagnosed with two autoimmune/inflammatory diseases: POTS andatopic dermatitis. POTS and atopic dermatitis are interrelated in that they areboth immune mediated. At the same time, she is diagnosed with sinusitis . . .In summary, while CM had risk factors as evidenced by a family history of drugsensitivities and allergies, CM was never symptomatic or diagnosed with POTS orAD prior to 5 weeks after the March 20, 2013 vaccination. The timing is wellwithin the timeframe for the development of HPV vaccination syndrome(ASIA/HANS). Thus, it is our opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certaintythat HPV vaccination caused CM’s POTS, atopic dermatitis, fatigue, joint pain,lack of sleep, severe headaches, lack of ability to concentrate, fogginess, lackof sharp memory, severe anxiety, stress, and panic attacks.13[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn8_13]This case absolutely broke my heart. Imagine being a thirteen-year-old girltraining for a triathlon. Is this a future Olympic medalist? Seriously, how manythirteen-year-olds do you know that are training for a triathlon?You are incredibly fit but then start having trouble when you stand up. Oneepisode is so bad you lose consciousness for twenty to thirty minutes. At thesame time, you develop a horrific skin condition. A beautiful teenager who mustcover her skin and face because of lesions and peeling skin! What are the mostpromising areas of research for skin conditions?Moderating the immune response.I want you to consider how unscientific the attack is on researchers like Frankand me as we are attempting to fix something that has gone terribly wrong inmedicine. Frank and I have dedicated our lives to studying the immune system andits effect on human health.We pioneered the field of modifying the function of the immune system throughimmunotherapies as a game-changing improvement to public health. However, weneed to understand what we’re doing and make sure we monitor the effects.Nobody is acknowledging that vaccines are immunotherapy on a massive scale, andwe have no idea what effect they are having on the population.Should it come as any surprise that the bureaucrats of the Vaccine Court weren’tinterested in hearing our opinion?In fact, they didn’t even want to acknowledge our academic credentials.image [../Images/common.jpg]The hammer was dropped on us by Special Master of the Vaccine Court Christian J.Moran on May 25, 2018, in the case of Dominguez v. Secretary of Health and HumanServices, No. 12-378V. The issue was the hourly pay rate Frank and I werecharging as PhD immunotherapy experts.In our letter from October of 2017 to the attorney in charge of this case, wewrote about the amount of time Frank and I spent on the case:We previously submitted a report in the case of G. D. vs. HHS. For thepreparation of that report, we each first independently read and reviewed theclinical histories, previous annual physician visits, all diagnoses andtreatments (exhibits 1–16).We next spent more than 40 hours (each) searching and reviewing literatureconcerned with the development of vasculitis and granulomatous disease includingextensive new literature regarding the innate and adaptive immune responses torecombinant vaccine antigens, attenuated viruses, vaccine excipients includingbut not limited to: aluminum, mercury, cellular debris, replication competentretroviruses, and virus-like particles and their effects on their effects on theimmune system . . .This rigorous review was accomplished because we were instructed to consider allpossible causes of the development of vasculitis and granulomatous disease.Wherever possible we quoted directly from the records in preparing the summaryof pertinent medical facts. We did not interpret any of the medical factspresented in Exhibits 1–16. We simply reported them. Wherever possible we quoteddirectly as written by the treating physician with the inclusion of thediagnostic codes used by the treating physicians.14[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn8_14]What was becoming clear to Frank and me was that the VICP judges didn’t like usin their courts. Perhaps some of this friction was inevitable, as we wereresearchers, asking difficult and sometimes provocative questions, and the courtitself was set up to be rather conservative.I experienced a great deal of frustration because it seems to me a courtroom, oranything that is supposed to vaguely resemble one, should be the vehicle for arelentless search for truth. One cannot settle for incomplete answers.Do any of us rest easy when an innocent person is sentenced to death? No, itdisturbs all of us.As I worked in the court, it appeared to me the pharmaceutical companies hadpulled off a terrible trick, getting the United States government to be theirshield against claims of consumer harm. Instead of warriors for public health,we had to settle for lazy bureaucrats simply interested in doing their timeuntil their pensions vested.In this case, we provided an invoice for $33,950.00 with a billing rate of $350an hour. Pay attention to the disrespect of Special Master Christian Moran inhis first discussion of his decision:The balance of costs comes from an invoice of $33,950.00 for expert servicesprovided by Ms. Mikovits and Mr. Ruscetti. Although both Ms. Mikovits and Mr.Rusectti signed the expert reports, Ms. Mikovits was to be the sole testifyingwitness and the analysis here thus refers solely to her.15[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn8_15]Is it possible to be any more demeaning in a few short sentences? Unless SpecialMaster Christian Moran has some new academic oversight of which I’m unaware,Frank and I should be referred to as Dr. Ruscetti and Dr. Mikovits. Last time Ichecked, we still had our PhDs.And why is it that Special Master Moran seeks to completely discount Frank’swork on the report? Isn’t one of the benefits of a report from two researchersthe idea that they check each other’s work? Fine, I understand that I’ve beenattacked, and my reputation has been dragged through the mud. But Frank’sreputation is still as pure as the driven snow. Doesn’t it mean something thathe did the work and signed the report, as well?It gets worse:An hourly rate of $350 is consistent with the range of rates provided to expertmedically-trained immunologists with extensive research experience that testifyin the Vaccine Program. . . . It is true that Ms. Mikovits has been awarded aPh.D. in biochemistry and neither Dr. Bellanti nor Dr. Shoenfeld has a Ph.D.While earning a Ph.D. is, itself, an accomplishment, an advanced degree isneither sufficient nor necessary for demonstrating the scientific expertiseexpected of expert witnesses in the Vaccine Program.16[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn8_16]I think it would probably have been a little less demeaning if he’d patted me onthe head, called me a good little girl, and sent me on my way with a lollipop.This is the final insult from Special Master Moran to the report Frank and Iwrote:Based on her reputation and bona fides, Ms. Mikovits’ credentials are simply notin the same league as experts who are paid $250 (or more) per hour. While thisdoes not mean that Ms. Mikovits is incapable of providing expert testimony onspecific topics, it does mean that she cannot expect to be paid the same hourlyrate as those with much better reputations than she. Individuals with betterreputations are, presumably, in far higher demand. Accordingly, based on therate that the undersigned found reasonable for non-medically trainedimmunologists, $250 per hour, the undersigned makes an additional deduction of40%. This deduction reflects Ms. Mikovits’ relative lack of reputability in thefield compared to comparable experts. This results in a rate of $150 per hourfor a non-medically trained immunologist of Ms. Mikovits’ reputation.17[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn8_17]Let’s make sure we understand everything Special Master Moran is saying.Apparently, my twenty years of government research experience, includingdirecting the world-renowned Lab of Anti-Viral Drug Mechanisms at the NationalCancer Institute, mean next to nothing. The same could be said of my research,which changed the treatment of HIV-AIDS, saving the lives of millions. SpecialMaster Moran also trashes the reputation of Frank, one of the greatestscientists to ever work in the field of cancer and who cofounded the disciplineof human retrovirology. What does Special Master Moran make of the fact thatFrank also signed the report in this case? Apparently nothing. Does SpecialMaster Moran believe I spiked Frank’s morning coffee as we were workingtogether, then in his dazed state I got him to sign the report?Let me tell you what Frank thinks about these shenanigans by Special MasterMoran. He thinks that destroying the messengers is an old, cheap trick used todestroy the message. His number one rule has always been honesty and integrity.After that you are careful in trying to avoid errors, eliminating bias, and youare open in sharing data, resources, criticism, and ideas. He is frustrated andalarmed for the future by what he sees happening to projects after they arecompleted in a lab. He believes scientific communication is being distorted bythe government regulatory agencies, the scientific journals, the mainstreammedia, and blogs by scientists promoting their own self-interest.Frank and I are careful readers of scientific articles because we do actualresearch. One of Frank’s favorite articles on this point was written by thelongtime editor of the British Medical Journal, Richard Smith. The provocativetitle by this longtime journal editor is “Doctors Are Not Scientists.” These arepoints Frank often shares with me:Some doctors are scientists—just as some politicians are scientists—but most arenot.As medical students they were filled with information on biochemistry, anatomy,physiology, and other sciences, but information does not a scientistmake—otherwise you could become a scientist by watching the Discovery channel. Ascientist is somebody who constantly questions, generates falsifiablehypotheses, and collects data from well-designed experiments . . .The inevitable consequence is that most readers of most medical journals don’tread the original articles. They may scan the abstract, but it’s the rarest ofbeasts who reads an article from beginning to end, critically appraising it ashe or she goes. Indeed, most doctors are incapable of critically appraising anarticle. They have never been trained to do so. Instead, they must accept thejudgment of the editorial team and its peer reviewers—until one of the rarebeasts writes in and points out that a study is scientifically nonsensical.18[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn8_18]In most research projects, several different explanations can account for theresults, equally well. Continued experimentation to reach a conclusion is theway science used to work, not through media pronouncements, government policies,and forced retractions.19 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn8_19]But it seems that the disrespect with which the Vaccine Court treats those whoclaim vaccines are causing damage is just the same as with the experts on theirown side, who when they do their own research come to the same conclusion.Witness the story of Dr. Andrew Zimmerman, the government’s own expert witnessin the Autism Omnibus Hearing before the vaccine court.image [../Images/common.jpg]Okay, so apparently even though I have a PhD in biochemistry, have publishedmore than fifty peer-reviewed articles, changed the treatment of HIV-AIDSimpacting the lives of millions, and headed up a lab at the National CancerInstitute, I’m not qualified to be paid the same as other experts in VaccineCourt.Somebody who could certainly demand more without the slightest bit ofcontroversy is Sharyl Attkisson, the Emmy Award-winning former CBS News reporterwho now has her own news show on the Sinclair Broadcasting Network called FullMeasure. Attkisson is one of the few journalists who, in my opinion, hasconsistently covered the vaccine-autism issue, including most notably aninterview with the former head of Health and Human Services, Dr. BernadineHealy, who expressed strong support for looking at vulnerable subgroups ofchildren who might have a negative reaction to a vaccination.However, in January of 2019, Attkisson revealed what was arguably her biggestscoop on the vaccine-autism controversy when she did a segment on theallegations of the government’s chief medical witness in the Autism-Omnibushearings in 2007. This is from an article Attkisson wrote for The Hill inJanuary of 2019 on the story:A world-renowned pro-vaccine medical expert is the newest voice adding to thebody of evidence suggesting that vaccines can cause autism in certainsusceptible children.Pediatric neurologist Dr. Andrew Zimmerman originally served as the expertmedical witness for the government, which defends vaccines in federal vaccinecourt. He had testified that vaccines do not cause autism in specific patients.Dr. Zimmerman has now signed a bombshell sworn affidavit. He says that, during agroup of 5,000 vaccine-autism cases being heard in court on June 15, 2007, hetook aside the Department of Justice (DOJ) lawyers he worked for defendingvaccines and told then he’d discovered “exceptions in which vaccinations couldcause autism.”“I explained that in a subset of children, vaccine-induced fever and immunestimulation did cause regressive brain disease with features of autism spectrumdisorder,” Dr. Zimmerman now states. He said his opinion was based on“scientific advances” as well as his own experience with patients.20[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn8_20]This was the government’s main scientific witness in what was the biggestcontroversy in medicine saying, “Yes, in certain circumstances, vaccines cancause autism.” How was this not the biggest headline in public health of thetwenty-first century?”Dr. Zimmerman goes on to say that once the DOJ lawyers learned of his position,they quickly fired him as an expert witness and kept his opinion secret fromother parents and the rest of the public.What’s worse, he says the DOJ went on to misrepresent his opinion in federalvaccine court to continue to debunk vaccine-autism claims.Records show that on June 18, 2007, a DOJ attorney to whom Dr. Zimmerman spoketold the vaccine court: “We know [Dr. Zimmerman’s] views on this issue . . .There is no scientific basis for a connection” between vaccines and autism.Dr. Zimmerman now calls that “highly misleading” and says he’d told them theopposite.21 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn8_21]According to Attkisson, Dr. Zimmerman knew in June of 2007 that vaccines couldcause autism in certain susceptible children, especially among those whodeveloped a fever after a vaccination. I’d like to point out that thegovernment’s own expert witness came to this conclusion a full two years beforeI even broached such a possibility. How can he call himself a doctor if heknowingly avoids the Hippocratic Oath for more than a decade, which states,“First, do no harm”?I’m really struggling to contain my anger as I write these words.Just for the sake of argument, let’s say Zimmerman attempted to do the rightthing by telling the government lawyers that vaccines could cause autism in acertain subset of children.For this act of honesty, he gets kicked out of Vaccine Court. Fine, I respectthat.And then he does nothing for the next ten years?No call to the New York Times or the Washington Post? In all those years, hecould easily have picked up the phone to dial one of these papers and said,“Hey, Mr. Reporter, I’m the director of Medical Research for Autism at theKennedy-Krieger Institute for Johns Hopkins University, and I think I know whatmight be causing at least some of the autism in the United States? Are youinterested in interviewing me?”Was he unaware of how the country and families are being ripped apart over thisquestion? Did he have any responsibility to speak up? This was a man whounderstood what was going on years before I did, yet I’m the one who spoke upand got my reputation dragged through the mud. I voiced my concerns, wasarrested in a show of force more suited for some drug lord, jailed for five dayswithout bail, had my mug shot taken and put in Science, lost my career, wentbankrupt, and now I’m insulted and refused rightful pay for hundreds of hours ofhonest work by a moronic corrupt special master in Vaccine Court?Maybe I’m doing all the talking for Dr. Andrew Zimmerman.Sharyl Attkisson offered Dr. Zimmerman the opportunity to be interviewed oncamera, but he declined, sending her instead to his signed affidavit. So, don’tlet me speak for Dr. Zimmerman, or Sharyl Attkisson, even though she’s anEmmy-winning journalist.This is Andrew Zimmerman in his own words:I, Andrew Walter Zimmerman, M. D., do hereby state under oath as follows:I am a board certified, pediatric neurologist and former director of MedicalResearch, Center for Autism and Related Disorders, Kennedy Krieger Institute,and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.I was a reviewer for the National Academy of Sciences 2004 report entitledIMMUNIZATION SAFETY REVIEW: VACCINES AND AUTISM, which was prepared by theImmunization Safety Review Committee, at the request of the Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and theInstitute of Medicine (IOM) . . .22 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn8_22]The next portion of Zimmerman’s affidavit relates to another autism case inwhich he did not believe vaccines contributed to that child’s autism. ThenZimmerman lays out in his own words exactly what he told the Department ofJustice lawyers and their response to what Zimmerman was planning to say in histestimony:On Friday, June 15th, 2007, I was present during a portion of the O.A.P.[Omnibus Autism Proceeding] to hear the testimony of the Petitioner’s expert inthe field of pediatric neurology, Dr. Marcel Kinsbourne. During a break in theproceedings, I spoke with DOJ attorneys and specifically the lead DOJ attorney,Vincent Matanoski in order to clarify my written expert opinion.I clarified that my written expert opinion regarding Michelle Cedillo was a casespecific opinion as to Michelle Cedillo. My written expert opinion regardingMichelle Cedillo was not intended to be a blanket statement as to all childrenand all medical science.I explained that I was of the opinion that there were exceptions in whichvaccinations could cause autism.23 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn8_23]My coauthor, Kent, an attorney, loves to quote from legal documents. He likes tohave the exhibits shown to you in their entirety. But I prefer to break them upinto more easily digestible pieces and summarize. Zimmerman was the government’sexpert on vaccines and gave an opinion in the case of Michelle Cedillo. Based onhis review of her records, he did not believe vaccines were responsible for herautism.However, he did not intend his opinion about Cedillo be a stand-in for allclaims of vaccine injury resulting in autism. In fact, he believed there weresituations in which vaccines COULD cause autism.Let that sink in.Imagine if the government said we’re reviewing claims of alien abduction. In thecase of one person who claimed to have been abducted, the government comes outand says we don’t believe the evidence supports that claim. But what if thegovernment came out and said, “Hey, this other guy, we believe he was abductedby aliens. And just to add a little more context, we think 30 percent of thepeople who claim abduction by aliens are telling the truth.”The entire world would change in that single moment.Vaccines are harming a certain group of children as they go for their pediatricwellness visits, the government is concealing this information from the doctors,and the children who are affected are damaged for life.And the government lawyers, and probably their superiors, knew this since atleast 2007.In his affidavit, Zimmerman further detailed the basis for his belief thatvaccines could cause autism in some children:More specifically, I explained that in a subset of children with an underlyingmitochondrial dysfunction, vaccine induced fever and immune stimulation thatexceeded metabolic energy reserves could, and in at least one of my patients,did cause regressive encephalopathy with features of autism spectrum disorder.I explained that my opinion regarding exceptions in which vaccines could causeautism was based on advances in science, medicine, and clinical research of oneof my patients in particular.For confidentiality reasons, I did not state the name of my patient. However, Ispecifically referenced and discussed with Mr. Matanoski and the other DOJattorneys that were present, the medical paper, Developmental Regression andMitochondrial Dysfunction in a Child with Autism, which was published in theJournal of Child Neurology and co-authored by Jon Poling, M.D., Ph.D., RichardFrye, M.D., Ph.D., John Shoffner, M.D., and Andrew W. Zimmerman, M.D., a copy ofwhich is attached as exhibit C.Shortly after I clarified my opinions with the DOJ attorneys, I was contacted byone of the junior DOJ attorneys and informed that I would no longer be needed asan expert witness on behalf of H.H.S. [Health and Human Services] The telephonecall in which I was informed that the DOJ would no longer need me as a witnesson behalf of H.H.S. occurred after the above referenced conversation on Friday,June 15, 2007, and before Monday, June 18, 2007.To the best of my recollection, I was scheduled to testify on behalf of H.H.S.on Monday, June 18, 2007.24 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn8_24]Zimmerman believes a vaccination and the accompanying immune stimulation mightoverwhelm a child’s energy supply and cause an encephalopathy (brain swelling)resulting in “features” of autism. I have a little trouble with Zimmerman’sphrasing of “features of autism spectrum disorder.” It means autism, and heshould’ve just said it. There is no difference between “autism” and “features ofautism spectrum disorder.”Then we come to one of the oldest stories in the world: the cover-up of anembarrassing truth.The government, in preparing its case, looked for and found one of the bestexperts in the country, Dr. Andrew Zimmerman of Johns Hopkins University.An expert like Zimmerman would tend to be more conservative in his opinions,likely to discount newly expressed and intriguing theories until a robust set ofevidence has been presented. To some this may be a drawback, but to others itwould be a benefit. If Zimmerman believes something to be true, all sides can becomfortable his view is well supported, if not invulnerable.Zimmerman gave his opinion in the Cedillo case that her autism was not caused byvaccines.But he did tell the government attorneys that his medical opinion was thatvaccines could cause autism in certain children, based on a preexisting weaknessin their energy production. He had observed at least one child who fit thisdiagnosis and published about it.Zimmerman told the DOJ attorneys of this opinion on Friday, June 15, 2007,knowing he was scheduled to testify in another case the following Monday.Sometime during that weekend, Zimmerman was called by the Department of Justiceand told his services would no longer be needed.Yes, I know, correlation does not mean causation.Just because when I walk into a crosswalk and go flying thirty feet at the sametime a car barrels through the same crosswalk doesn’t mean I was hit by thatcar.Maybe there’s some other explanation.Like aliens did it.And at the same time, they smashed up the car with their laser beam. Zimmermancontinues in his affidavit with information about the child he observed, HannahPoling, who happened to be the daughter of one of Zimmerman’s fellow neurologistcolleagues, Dr. Jon Poling:At the time of the above referenced conversation with the DOJ, I did not knowthat Hazlehurst v. HHS or Poling v. HHS were potential cases in the OAP.[Omnibus Autism Proceeding]It is my understanding that the HHS concession in Poling v. H.H.S. has becomecommon knowledge and has been published by international media. Among other newscoverage, I reviewed the CNN interview in which Dr. Julie Gerberding, the formerhead of the CDC discussed the concession by H.H.S. in Poling v. H.H.S. and theinterview with Dr. Jon Poling, the father of the child whose case was conceded.The summary language, “the vaccination . . . significantly aggravated anunderlying mitochondrial disorder, which predisposed her to deficits in cellularenergy metabolism, and manifested as a regressive encephalopathy with featuresof autism spectrum disorder” is in essence the chain of causation that Iexplained to the DOJ attorneys including Vincent Matanoski during the abovereferenced conversation on June 15, 2007.I have reviewed extensive genetic, metabolic and other medical records ofWilliam “Yates” Hazlehurst. In my opinion, and to a reasonable degree of medicalcertainty, Yates Hazlehurst suffered regressive encephalopathy with features ofautism spectrum disorder as a result of a vaccine injury in the same manner asdescribed in the DOJ concession in Poling v H.H.S., with the additional factorsthat Yates Hazlehurst was vaccinated while ill, administered antibiotics andafter previously suffering from symptoms consistent with a severe adversereaction.25 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn8_25]Those paragraphs may be the most important of the affidavit, but I’ll need toprovide a little background for you to fully understand their importance.The setup of the Omnibus Autism Proceeding was that the five test cases wouldstand in for the more than five thousand claims that had been filed. Poling wassupposed to have been the first, but it was settled prior to the start of theproceeding.Cedillo was next, and as you’ve read, the evidence in that case was not strongenough in Zimmerman’s opinion to support a finding that vaccines had causedMichelle Cedillo’s autism.(My coauthor, Kent, strongly disagrees with that conclusion, but let’s leavethat aside for the moment.)The case of William “Yates” Hazlehurst was scheduled to be the third case, butsince Poling had settled (and was subject to a nondisclosure agreement), itwould be the next case after Cedillo.In Zimmerman’s opinion, Hazlehurst’s closely resembled the Hannah Poling case,meaning that vaccines did cause his injuries, and he was prepared to testify tothat fact. This is what Dr. Zimmerman wrote in a two-page letter to the Polings’attorney on November 30, 2007, about Hannah’s case:The cause for regressive encephalopathy in Hannah at age 19 months wasunderlying mitochondrial dysfunction, exacerbated by vaccine-induced fever andimmune stimulation that exceeded metabolic energy reserves. This acuteexpenditure of metabolic reserves led to irreversible brain injury.26[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn8_26]How large of a problem would a decision in favor of Yates Hazlehurst have beento the United States government?One of Dr. Zimmerman’s colleagues in the Omnibus Autism Proceeding was Dr.Richard Kelley, a professor of pediatrics from Johns Hopkins University(Kennedy-Krieger Institute), who is acknowledged to be one of the country’sleading experts on mitochondrial dysfunction. In 2018, Dr. Zimmerman and Dr.Kelley joined a lawsuit on behalf of Yates Hazlehurst and have given depositionsas to their opinion regarding what happened to Yates and the events surroundingthe Omnibus Autism Proceeding. This is what Dr. Kelley said in his writtenaffidavit for the Hazlehurst case:I also find with a high degree of medical certainty, that the set ofimmunizations administered to Yates at age 11 months while he was ill was theimmediate cause of his autistic regression because of the effect of theseimmunizations to further impair the ability of his weakened mitochondria tosupply adequate amounts of energy for the brain, the highest energy consumingtissue in the body.27 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn8_27]Let’s use that as something of a working hypothesis for autism. For some reason,the mitochondria are not working at an optimal level. We know that retrovirusestend to lower the activity of the mitochondria, so if we had many children withactive retroviruses, the effect would be lowered energy. I think that’s areasonable hypothesis.J.B. Handley, in his excellent 2018 book, How to End the Autism Epidemic, quotesextensively from the Dr. Kelley deposition in the Hazlehurst case. Here is anexcerpt from the deposition:Lawyer: Would you say that you are an expert in mitochondrial dysfunction butnot in autism. Would that be a fair way to describe it?Dr. Kelley: I am an expert in mitochondrial disease. And I am an expert in theaspect of autism that pertain to the roughly 25, 30, 40 percent of children whohave autism based on mitochondrial dysfunction.28[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn8_28]Let’s do the math.In 2007 it was estimated there were close to a million children with autism inthe United States. Kelley believed in 2007 that roughly one-third or more of thechildren with autism have a mitochondrial dysfunction that is responsible fortheir autism. Vaccines will drain mitochondrial reserves.Let’s put that number at three hundred thousand children (30 percent of amillion children), a conservative estimate, as I’m sure Andrew Zimmerman wouldapprove.It’s been estimated that the lifetime care cost for a child with autism is threemillion dollars.What is three hundred thousand multiplied by three million?It’s nine hundred billion dollars.Nine hundred billion dollars is a conservative estimate of damages for which thefederal government would be responsible if Vincent Matanoski had allowed thegovernment’s own medical witness to testify in the Yates Hazlehurst case on June18, 2007.But it gets even worse, if such a thing were possible.It wasn’t that Department of Justice lawyer Matanoski excluded the evidenceprovided by Dr. Zimmerman; he actively misrepresented what Dr. Zimmerman hadspecifically told the Department of Justice lawyers.Zimmerman’s statement continues:I have reviewed the attached portions of the transcript, of Vincent Matanoski’sclosing argument on Hazlehurst v. H.H.S., which is attached as exhibit D. Therelevant portion of the transcript states as follows:I did want to mention one thing about an expert, who did not appear here, buthis name has been mentioned several times, and that was Dr. Zimmerman.Dr. Zimmerman actually has not appeared here, but he has given evidence on thisissue and it has appeared in the Cedillo case. I just wanted to read brieflybecause his name was mentioned several times by Petitioners in this matter. Whathis views were on these theories, and I’m going to quote from Respondent’sExhibit FF in the Cedillo case, which is part of the record in this case as Iunderstand it.“There is no scientific basis for a connection between measles, mumps andrubella MMR vaccine or mercury intoxication in autism despite well-intentionedand thoughtful hypotheses and widespread beliefs about apparent connection withautism and regression. There’s no sound evidence to support a causativerelationship with exposure to both or either MMR and/or mercury.”We know his views on this issue.In my opinion, the statement by Mr. Matanoski during his closing argumentregarding my opinion was highly misleading and not an accurate reflection of myopinion out of context. My opinion as to Michelle Cedillo was case-specific. Iwas only referring to the medical evidence I had reviewed regarding her. Myopinion regarding Michelle Cedillo was not intended to be a blanket statement asto all children and all medical science. Second, as explained above, Ispecifically explained to Mr. Matanoski and the other DOJ attorneys who werepresent that there were exceptions in which vaccinations could cause autism.In my opinion, it was highly misleading for the Department of Justice tocontinue to use my original written expert opinion, as to Michelle Cedillo, asevidence against the remaining petitions in the O.A.P. in light of the abovereferenced information which I explained to the DOJ attorneys while omitting thecaveat regarding exceptions in which vaccinations could cause autism.29[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn8_29]The mind boggles when it reads a statement such as that from Dr. Zimmerman. WhatMatanoski is alleged to have done is to misrepresent evidence that vaccineinjuries were taking place, even when verified by their own medical experts.I have come to understand why parents of vaccine-injured children view thefederal government as their enemy.image [../Images/common.jpg]In retrospect, I should perhaps feel fortunate that the Vaccine Court publisheda document in which they refused to give Frank and me our proper professionaldesignations in 2018.At least I have their disrespect crimes in writing.Zimmerman just got a phone call in 2007.We were saying the same things in 2018 that Zimmerman was saying in 2007, withthe benefit of eleven years of additional scientific research.And what was a nine-hundred-billion-dollar liability in 2007 has only grownlarger, with the estimate now of 1.8 million children in the United Stateshaving autism.My identity may have been stolen in Vaccine Court, but the corruption in thatcourt has robbed children and families in America of so much more.Justice must come for all. I pray the day of reckoning is close."},{"pageContent":"images [../Images/line.jpg]CHAPTER NINEWhat I Really Think about HIV and Ebolaimages [../Images/line.jpg]It’s my intention to make this the simplest chapter of the book to understand.The downside is I’m likely to completely destroy your faith in vaccines as wellas a big chunk of public health.When this chapter is over, I don’t think you’ll ever look at vaccines in thesame way. I apologize in advance for any problems this may cause among yourfriends and family.I strongly encourage you to check my work to see if I’ve made any errors of factor interpretation, but I feel as strongly about this claim as anything in mylife.image [../Images/common.jpg]The first concept I want you to understand is called zoonosis, or more properly,zoonotic diseases. If you think it’s a funny word and you immediately imagined apicture of a zoo, you wouldn’t be far off. Zoonosis literally means a diseasewhich can spread between animals and humans.It may surprise you given my reputation as a renegade, but I believe the Centersfor Disease Control (CDC) can occasionally provide good, basic information tothe public. Here is what they have on their website about zoonotic diseases.Every year, tens of thousands of Americans will get sick from diseases spreadbetween animals and people. These are known as zoonotic diseases. Zoonotic meansinfectious diseases that are spread between animals and people. Because thesediseases cause sickness or death in people, CDC is always tracking them.Animals provide many benefits to people. Many people interact with animals intheir daily lives, both at home and away from home. Pets offer companionship andentertainment, with millions of households having one or more pets . . .However, some animals can carry harmful genes that can be shared with people andcause illness—these are known as zoonotic diseases or zoonoses. Zoonoticdiseases are caused by harmful germs like viruses, bacteria, parasites, andfungi. These germs can cause many different types of illnesses in people andanimals ranging from mild to serious illness to death. Some animals can appearhealthy even when they are carrying germs that can make people sick.Zoonotic diseases are very common, both in the United States and around theworld. Scientists estimate that more than 6 out of every 10 known infectiousdiseases in people are spread from animals, and 3 out of every 4 new emerginginfectious diseases in people are spread from animals.1[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn9_1]That’s good solid information from the CDC and underscores the scope of theproblem. Tens of thousands of Americans at the very least will get sick everyyear from illnesses spread by some form of association with animals. Zoonoticdiseases account for more than 60 percent of known infectious diseases and atleast 75 percent of new emerging infectious diseases. This is probably one ofthe biggest challenges in public heath you’ve never heard about, even though youcan find it prominently displayed on the CDC website.What are some of these diseases, you might ask? This is a partial list: anthrax,bird flu, bovine tuberculosis, cat scratch fever, dengue fever, Ebola,encephalitis from ticks, enzootic abortion, hemorrhagic colitis, hepatitis E,listeria infection, Lyme disease, malaria, parrot fever, plague, rabies,rat-bite fever, ringworm, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, swine flu,toxoplasmosis, West Nile virus, and zoonotic diphtheria.2[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn9_2]And the biggest zoonotic disease that is not covered in that list is HIV-AIDS,which affected more than sixty million people leading to our world’s greatestmodern plague. While a good deal of ink has been dedicated to the question ofhow prejudice against the gay lifestyle delayed efforts to properly address thedisease, our job as scientists is to provide an explanation of events in thepast and how problems might be avoided in the future.Let’s make sure we understand our terms. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)is linked to the condition known as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).There was a brief time when the disease was known as gay-related immune disease(GRID), and many activists claim the name change to AIDS prompted a morebalanced examination of the disease. Perhaps this is true.But what of the genesis of the retrovirus HIV? Where did it come from?We have a clear answer.It came from a primate. The field agrees the precursor to HIV was the simianimmunodeficiency virus or SIV.To be more precise, the human virus came from a monkey or chimpanzee virus.After that, any potential areas of agreement break down.I vividly recall working as a technician at the Biological Response ModifiersProgram at Fort Detrick in the early 1980s, where it was my job to isolate HIVfrom samples and find a cell line or tissue to grow the virus. If you can’t growthe virus outside a human body, you can’t study it.What we were told at the time was that the disease probably jumped to humans asa result of Africans forgetting how to cook their food, in this casechimpanzees, often referred to as “bush meat,” and that the promiscuous sexuallifestyles of African peoples (with implications of possible bestiality withprimates) led to the cross-species jump and spread of the virus among the humanpopulation. I am now appalled that at the time we did not more closely questionthese assumptions.Since that time, there have been two competing and, in my mind, closely relatedtheories of how a chimpanzee retrovirus made the jump to humans.The first was popularized by the journalist Edward Hooper and expanded upon inhis lengthy 1999 book, The River: A Journey to the Source of HIV and AIDS, forwhich he conducted more than six hundred interviews. Of the interviewsconducted, Hooper was most impressed with evolutionary biologist Bill Hamilton,who, along with other independent researchers such as Louis Pascal, Tom Curtis,and Blaine Elswood, was proposing an idea that, before my work with XMRV, Iwould have found quite radical. They proposed that the jump from chimpanzees tohumans came as a result of vaccine trials in the Belgian Congo from 1957 to 1960in which more than five hundred common chimpanzees and bonobos (pygmychimpanzees) were killed so that their kidney cells and sera could be used togrow the oral polio vaccine. This vaccine was subsequently administered to morethan a million Africans during that time period.Hooper suggests there was great resistance to this idea, since even in the late1950s and early 1960s there was little public support for the idea of usingchimpanzees in such medical experiments. In addition, the Belgian royal familywas publicly supporting the idea of wildlife conservation, and the revelation ofthese actions would go against that image. Hooper believes another reason forresistance to his idea is that if his theory was accepted, it would shake publicconfidence in the medical establishment as well as lead to multibillion-dollarclass action lawsuits for the AIDS epidemic.This is what Edward Hooper has written on his website about the circumstancessurrounding the creation of HIV-AIDS from these experiments and why it makesmore sense than the competing bush-meat and “cut hunter” theory.By contrast, the oral polio vaccine (OPV) theory proposes that an experimentalOPV that had been locally prepared in chimpanzee cells and administered bymouth, or “fed,” to nearly one million Africans in vaccine trials staged in thethen Belgian-ruled territories of the Belgian Congo and Ruanda-Urundi between1957 and 1960, represents the origin of the AIDS pandemic. It provides ahistorically-supported background: that between 1956 and 1959 over 500 commonchimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthi and Pan troglodytes troglodytes) andbonobos or pygmy chimpanzees (Pan paniscus) were housed together at Lindi Camp(Near Stanleyville in the Belgian Congo, or DRC).3[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn9_3]Hooper goes on to explain that the use of chimpanzees was not technicallyprohibited by any conventions, but that in most countries around the world atthe time, Asian macaques were used in polio virus preparation. As for the claimof other outbreaks, Hooper believes they fit comfortably within the bounds ofhis theory:The OPV theory ascribes the minor outbreaks of AIDS caused by other variants ofHIV-1 (Group O, Group N and the more controversial “Group P”) to other poliovaccines (both oral and injected) that were prepared in the cells of chimpanzeesand administered in French Equatorial Africa (including Congo Brazzaville andGabon) in the same late fifties period. It ascribes the outbreak of AIDS fromHIV-2 (of which it maintains that only two were epidemic outbreaks) to otherpolio vaccines (both oral and injected) that were prepared in the cells of sootymangabeys (or other monkeys that had been caged with sooty mangabeys) andadministered in French West Africa in 1956–1960. All the other HIV-2 groups thatare claimed by bush-meat theorists have infected just a single person, and someOPV theory supporters argue that dead-end, non-transmissible infections such asthese are the natural fate of SIVs that infect human beings via the bushmeatroute: that unless they are introduced in an artificial manner (as via avaccine), they simply die out.4 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn9_4]I find myself in complete agreement with Hooper’s analysis. Yes, viruses canjump from one species to another, possibly by the eating of an infected animal.But the natural process of degradation by the digestive system, as well ascooking (even when poorly done) is likely to inactivate most pathogens.The second plausible theory, which has come to be known as the “bush-meat”theory, is that sometime early in the twentieth century an individual becameinfected with SIV from handling chimpanzees or chimpanzee bush-meat. It usuallyinvolves the actions of some anonymous native hunter (often called the “cuthunter” because he cut himself shortly after having killed a chimpanzee). Addedto this scenario is urbanization encroaching upon the jungle, allowing it to bespread by those newly introduced western evils of prostitution and intravenousdrug usage.This theory has recently been expanded by the science writer David Quammen inThe Chimp and the River: How AIDS Emerged from an African Forest. Based on anextrapolation of some scientific data, Quammen sets the date for this viraltransfer from chimp to human around 1908 in the area known as Leopoldville(later Kinshasa) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The description isvivid, and plausible, but I question much about it:Let’s give him due stature: not just a cut hunter but the Cut Hunter. Assuminghe lived hereabouts in the first decade of the twentieth century, he probablycaptured his chimpanzee with a snare made from a forest vine, or in some otherform of a trap, and then killed the animal with a spear. He may have been a BakaPygmy man, living independently with his extended family in the forest orfunctioning as sort of a serf under the “protection” of a Bantu village chief .. . There’s no way of establishing his identity, nor even his ethnicity, butthis remote southeastern corner of what was then Germany’s Kamerun colonyoffered plenty of candidates . . .The chimp too, tethered by a foot or a hand, would have been terrified as theman approached, but also angry and strong and dangerous. Maybe the man killed itwithout getting hurt; if so, he was lucky. Maybe there was an ugly fight; hemight even have been pummeled by the chimp, or badly bitten. But he won. Then hewould have butchered his prey, probably on the spot . . .I imagine him opening a long, sudden slice across the back of his left hand,into the muscular web between thumb and forefinger, his flesh smiling out pinkand raw almost before he saw the damage or felt it, because his blade was sosharp . . . His blood flowed out and mingled with the chimp’s, the chimp’sflowed in and mingled with his, so that he couldn’t quite tell which was which.He was up to his elbows in gore. He wiped his hand. Blood leaked again into hiscut, dribbled again into it from the chimp, and again he wiped. He had no way ofknowing, no language or words or thoughts by which to conceive, that this animalwas SIV-positive. The idea didn’t exist in 1908.5 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn9_5]It’s a possible scenario. I can’t say something like that didn’t happen. I justwonder why it hadn’t happened many centuries earlier. Africans had been huntingchimpanzees for thousands of years and cooking them. An interesting additionQuammen makes to the theory is that subsequently the virus spreads slowly amongthe population. But then starting in 1917, there were vaccination campaignsagainst sleeping sickness by European doctors who used glass syringes that werereusable. One French colonial doctor during a two-year period treated more thanfive thousand cases with only six syringes.6 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn9_6]These campaigns peaked in the early 1950s, and by that time the precursor to thedeadly strain of HIV had arisen.When you think about it, you come to the realization there’s a battle ofnarratives, with science having a definite preference for one over the other.In the first scenario, unwitting scientists release a plague of massiveproportions on the population because of their use of questionable animalexperiments, infecting more than sixty million people and causing the death ofat least thirty-nine million.In the second scenario, a chance event in a jungle encounter with an infectedchimpanzee leads to cross-species transmission, then because it’s always a goodplay to blame urbanization and prostitution, as well as maybe a littleinadvertent help from western medicine, and you have a new disease!Is it any surprise that scientists far prefer scenario number two?While I can’t come to a definitive conclusion as to which scenario is morelikely, the first one, in which chimpanzees are directly harvested for theirorgans and the growing of polio virus, makes the most sense to me. It doesn’thave as many moving parts.The virus is in a certain percentage of the five hundred chimpanzees sacrificed.They’re cut up, then used to grow polio vaccine, which is then given orally tonearly a million Africans. And there’s another part of the story that makesHooper’s account sound more plausible.After Hooper made his claim that the oral polio vaccine grown in chimpanzeetissue and given to humans was the source of the HIV-AIDS epidemic, there was an“investigation.” As I read Hooper’s account, it sounded a lot like the IanLipkin investigation into XMRV.In this great investigation, they sampled stocks of polio vaccine from the1957–1960 period for traces of chimpanzee DNA, or simian virus. Lo and behold,they found NOTHING!There’s just one problem. All of the samples they used were from the UnitedStates.They did not have any samples of polio vaccine from Africa. The samples of poliovaccine from the United States had never used chimpanzee tissues as a growthmedium or cell line.They DID NOT test African samples of the oral polio vaccine for that which usedchimpanzee tissue.This is what Hooper wrote about the supposed investigation into the use ofchimpanzee tissue in the development of the polio vaccine that was performed bythe Royal Society in September of 2000:Instead of the open and honest debate, and the even-handed investigation of theOPV theory, which had been promised, what actually took place was acarefully-planned attempt to suppress the theory by fair means or foul. Theconference became focused around the testing of samples of CHAT vaccine whichthe parent institute (The Wistar in Philadelphia) had finally released forindependent analysis. The vaccinators and the meeting organizers insisted thatthe vaccine samples were representative of the batches which had been preparedfor use in Africa. Since they tested negative for HIV, SIV, and chimpanzee DNA,they concluded that the OPV hypothesis had been disproved— and an acquiescentpress largely concurred.The reality, however, was very different. None of the tested samples had everbeen near Africa, let alone prepared for the African trials.As the weeks and months passed after the meeting, it became clear that acarefully-organized whitewash was being carried out, partly by the originalprotagonists (who had, among other things, leant on witnesses to change keyparts of their stories), and partly by well-meaning research scientists whocould not countenance the possibility that their work of the last ten yearsmight be erroneous, and who secondly were unwilling or unable to imagine thattheir peers might not be telling the truth.7 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn9_7]I’ve never met Edward Hooper, but he was writing this in 2004, years before Iever pursued a similar line of inquiry. I’m sure he must have undergone asimilar evolution, from hopeful questioner to disillusioned critic. Is it sodifficult to imagine that members of an organization will not believe the worstabout their own members? Don’t we see the same pattern among police, members ofthe clergy, and our political class? Isn’t it the rare member of an organizationwho sees the flaws of their own group?We leave scientists alone in their research and practice, expecting somehow thatthey can self-police. But we do not even allow the police to self-police. Thereare citizen review boards, internal affairs, and oversight committees.In a similar manner, we have learned through bitter experience that just becausea person is a member of the clergy doesn’t mean they are not capable of crimesagainst children. We are also beginning to understand that these crimes are notjust committed against the flock, but there are more nuns and sisters in theCatholic Church who are coming forward with stories of rape and sexual assaultcommitted by the male members of the clergy. These stories sicken us, butperhaps we have simply trusted too much in unaccountable authorities.Now, maybe Hooper is wrong about his accusation, but it sounds like a prettyserious charge to make. Given what I observed in the “official” investigationinto XMRV and the way they cavalierly rewrote basic principles of virology, I’mmore inclined to believe Hooper’s account. The scientific establishment tellstheir stories and expects we will believe them.The simian virus gets transferred into humans, and then the question becomes oneof immune activation. What happened in the gay community in the late 1970s andearly 1980s?There was a great deal of recreational drug usage, and it’s a scientific factthat anal sex, with its subsequent tearing of tissue, promotes immuneactivation. The sexual revolution for the heterosexual population, and thelesbian population as well, did not involve such risks.image [../Images/common.jpg]Are dangers to the human population limited to the use of chimpanzee tissue inthe development of medical products, or is it a more general question of anyanimal tissue? I tend to believe the latter and use as an example thecontroversy over Simian Virus-40 (SV-40) in the same antipolio campaign of the1950s and 1960s. The concern is that these viruses may lie dormant in peopleuntil some form of immune stimulation, just as we saw with HIV and the gaylifestyle that included multiple partners, sexual activity that involved analtearing, and high recreational drug usage.In her Pulitzer Prize-nominated book, The Pentagon’s Brain, detailing the workof the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), author Annie Jacobsenprovides a brief overview of this controversy. One of the DARPA scientists sheinterviewed for the book was microbiologist Stephen Block, and this is what shewrote:If the notion of a stealth virus, or silent load, sounded improbable, Blockcited a little-known controversy involving the anti-polio vaccination campaignof the late 1950s and early 1960s. According to Block, during this effortmillions of Americans risked contracting the “cryptic human infection” of monkeyvirus, without ever being told. “These vaccines,” writes Block, “were preparedusing live African green monkey kidney cells, and batches became contaminated bylow levels of a monkey virus, Simian virus 40 (SV 40), which eluded the qualitycontrol procedures of the day. As a result, large numbers of people—probablymillions in fact—were inadvertently exposed to SV 40.”8[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn9_8]The controversy over SV 40 was whether it would ultimately lead to cancers inhumans decades later. The virus would often be found in cancerous tissues,raising the question of whether it was simply a passenger or a causative agent.Again, this is the same concern raised by the finding of bovine leukemia virusin samples of breast cancer tissue and whether the use of growth hormone in thecattle was prompting the expression of this virus. It’s also worth noting thatessentially zero testing is done these days of animal viruses contaminating ourvaccines or other medical products. Our medical authorities simply assume we’reall tough enough to fight off these contaminating viruses. Jacobsen continues:Block says that two outcomes of this medical disaster remain debated. One sidesays the 98 million people vaccinated dodged a bullet. The other side believesthere is evidence the vaccine did harm. “A great deal of speculation occursabout whether [simian virus] may be responsible for some diseases” thatmanifests much later in the vaccinated person’s life, says Block, includingcancer.9 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn9_9]Let’s go to the doubters who agree that at least ninety-eight million peoplewere inoculated with a polio virus that was contaminated with SV-40. Is itreasonable to assume that if you fire ninety-eight million bullets, none willcause any harm?And this only considers the polio vaccine. Every vaccine has been grown inanimal tissue, usually of several different species, including monkey, mouse,bird, and cow. Each one of these cross-species events has the potential totransfer a pathogen to humans, or to create some new strain that can cause harm.We have fired several billion bullets of biological ammunition at the humanspecies, and it is the height of arrogance to believe we have caused zerodamage.image [../Images/common.jpg]In my discussion of Ebola, I want to highlight an idea many others have beendiscussing in recent years in one form or another, but that is likely toreconfigure how we go about promoting health.For more than a century, we’ve been promoting two different concepts, which whenyou think about it are fundamentally at odds with each other. The first conceptis that we need to ensure our food, air, and water is as free of pollutants andpathogens as possible. I have no problem saying I’m in favor of this effort ahundred percent.The second concept involves the belief that we need to prime our immune systemwith weakened or dead pathogens in order to deal with any challenges that mightcome our way over the course of a lifetime. This is the fundamental idea behindvaccinations.I think we’re committing overkill of a good idea, and it is leading to tragicunintended consequences.If we are living in a relatively clean environment, and we have propernutrition, then our immune system is going to develop naturally. I’ve heard manyactivists make the claim that vaccinations create “fake” immunity, whereas arobust immune system is more likely to be able to respond to any pathogens thatmight be encountered in the course of our regular lives in a relatively cleanenvironment. I have a great deal of sympathy for this position.Here’s one of the things that concerns me as an unintended outcome ofvaccinations. If we are taking all the possible pathogens, serious and mild,that we might conceivably encounter over the course of a lifetime, we are beingexposed to more pathogens than might otherwise be expected. That exposure is inmost cases bypassing critical immunity, such as the skin and gut. Each challengeto the immune system by a vaccination has the potential to dysregulate theimmune system. We have no idea what happens when multiple different pathogensare injected at the same time.The paper that most catalyzed my thinking in this area was published in Novemberof 2009, just around the same time I published my XMRV findings in Science. Thatpaper was published by some of my former colleagues at the National Institutesof Health. The title of it was “War and Peace Between Microbes: HIV-1Interactions with Co-infecting Viruses,” and it may be one of the most importantpapers of the last twenty-five years.From the introduction:The development of immunology in the last century led to the concept of ahealthy “germ-free” human body that repulses and eliminates invading microbes bygenerating effective immune reactions. Through the years, it became clear that ahealthy host is not germ free and does not always fight “germs” but may, rather,live in symbiotic relationships with some of them . . .Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), which has circulated in sooty mangabeys(SIVsm) and African green monkeys (SIVagm) for a long time, does not cause AIDS,despite high replication and lack of immune control (Paiardini et al., 2009).SIV began to infect chimpanzees (SIVcpz) more recently than sooty mangabeys orAfrican green monkeys, and it causes a disease, which is apparently less severethan the one that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) causes (Keele etal. 2009) . . . Its invasion greatly imbalances the body’s equilibrium withother microbes . . .The uncontrolled replication of the symbiotic and newly invading microbescontributes to the imbalance of the immune system by perpetuating itsuncoordinated activation, which, in turn, further accelerates progression towardAIDS (Figure 1B). Thus, like an orchestra that after a sudden disappearance ofthe conductor continues to play fragments of the scored melodies, inHIV-1-infected individuals, the immune system continues to play out a chaoticand ineffective attack against microbes.10 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn9_10]There’s a good deal to unpack in all of this, but it’s pretty straightforward.We’ve come to understand that it’s not enough to simply keep us away from germs,but that our immune system should be strong enough to either defeat those germsto which we’re exposed or reach a state of equilibrium with them. We are findingthat natural exposures, such as having the measles, not only provides lifelongimmunity, but also tunes the system to make it less likely you’ll have certaincancers when you’re older.I’ve already talked about the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and the factthat it can be found in chimpanzees, sooty mangabeys, and African green monkeys.Viruses and microbes have the capacity to unbalance the immune system. This canlead to activation of previously dormant viruses, or infection by others thathave now turned virulent due to decreased immune function.The image of an orchestra that has suddenly lost its conductor is one of thebest metaphors I’ve ever read for understanding this issue. Without theconductor, the orchestra can continue playing music, but it’s likely to be thewrong song.And what’s at stake is our health.image [../Images/common.jpg]And now I come to the recent emergence of Ebola and Zika.I want you to continue to hold onto that image of an immune system orchestrawithout a conductor.It may terrify you to know that I worked with the Ebola virus from 1992 to 1994at Fort Detrick in a biosafety level 4 lab, the highest level of containment.The Zaire strain was being studied at the US Army Medical Research Institute ofInfectious Diseases (USAMRIID), and it was my job to teach it how to infecthuman monocytes/macrophages without killing them. Because if you can’t grow thevirus, you can’t study it.It may surprise you to know that Ebola was never observed by Western medicineuntil 1976. Yes, that’s right, hundreds of years of African exploration anddevelopment, and we never saw Ebola. But it must have been there, right? Yes,I’m sure it was, either in the bats or certain primates, but it never made thatgreat leap from animals and into humans until after that time.Again, I go to the CDC’s own website for a brief history of Ebola:Ebola virus disease (EVD), one of the deadliest viral diseases, was discoveredin 1976 when two consecutive outbreaks of fatal hemorrhagic fever occurred indifferent parts of Central Africa. The first outbreaks occurred in theDemocratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire) in a village near the Ebola River,which gave the virus its name. The second outbreak occurred in what is now SouthSudan, approximately 500 miles (850 km) away.Initially, public health officials assumed these outbreaks were a single eventassociated with an infected person who travelled between the two locations.However, scientists later discovered that the two outbreaks were caused by twogenetically distinct viruses: Zaire ebolavirus and Sudan ebola-virus . . .Viral and epidemiological data suggest that Ebola virus existed long beforethese recorded outbreaks occurred. Factors like population growth, encroachmentinto forested areas, and direct interaction with wildlife (such as bush-meatconsumption) may have contributed to the spread of the Ebola virus . . .African fruit bats are likely involved in the spread of Ebola virus and may evenbe the source animal (reservoir host).11 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn9_11]Are we really to believe that in thousands of years of hunting, that Africansdid not contract Ebola? It really seems comical to even suggest such a scenario.I believe these pathogens have likely been living in Africans for thousands ofyears until we did something to disturb the immune system balance of the peopleof that continent. The recent emergence of pathogenic Zika in Brazil andColumbia is also supported by that hypothesis.What you do with a vaccination is you temporarily cripple a part of the immunesystem, as resources are diverted from protecting against other viruses totarget the virus from the vaccine.With multiple vaccinations, you cripple several parts of the immune system atthe same time and do nothing to restore the balance of the system.We don’t know what diseases we are spreading by rendering compromised immunesystems susceptible. It makes me angry because some of the best people in theworld, like Christian missionaries and medical aid workers, are going to thesecountries and creating the conditions for terrible outbreaks. They are sendingour very best people to unwittingly do the very worst things for the health ofhumanity.Let’s return to the CDC’s own website for a listing of outbreaks and numbers ofdeaths to see if you can’t discern a troubling pattern.The Sudan outbreak of 1976 had 284 reported cases with 151 fatalities. The CDCwebsite reports, “The outbreak is believed to have started with workers in acotton factory where 37% of workers in the cloth room were infected.”12[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn9_12] Are we really to believe that workers at a clothfactory, of all the places in Africa, were the most likely to have been out inthe bush hunting for monkeys and contracted this virus? Or is it more likelythat just prior to coming down with Ebola, there was a workplace vaccinationcampaign? The other outbreak that year in Zaire had 318 reported cases with 280deaths, although not much information is provided about the circumstances ofthat first appearance.In 1977, there was only one person who contracted Ebola in Zaire and died.We jump next to 1979, when there was another outbreak in the same area of theSudan as the 1976 outbreak. The numbers, though, were much smaller this time.There were thirty-four reported cases with only twenty-two fatalities.A full ten years pass until we see Ebola again, this time in 1989 and in twolocations, one in the Philippines and one in the United States.Both were . . . wait for it . . . facilities that housed monkeys.Of the Philippine situation, the CDC wrote, “High mortality among Cynomolgusmacaques was discovered in a primate facility responsible for exporting animalsto the United States. Three workers in the animal facility developed antibodies,but never experienced symptoms of Ebola Virus Disease . . . Ebola-Reston viruswas introduced into quarantine facilities in Virginia and Pennsylvania bymonkeys imported from the Philippines.”13 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn9_13]In 1990, this same Ebola-Reston virus was introduced to other quarantinefacilities in Virginia and Texas by monkeys imported from the Philippines.In 1992, Ebola-Reston virus was introduced into quarantine facilities in Siena,Italy, by monkeys from the Philippines.In 1994, there was high mortality reported among chimpanzees in a forest in theIvory Coast, and a scientist became ill after conducting an autopsy on a wildchimpanzee but later recovered. During that same year, an outbreak occurred inseveral gold-mining villages in the rainforest around Makakou, Gabon. There werefifty-two reported cases and thirty-one deaths.In 1995, there was an outbreak associated with a charcoal maker in the forestedarea around Kikwit, Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire). Therewere 315 reported cases and 250 deaths.In 1996, there were several small outbreaks. There was one reported case fromRussia, where a Russian laboratory worker was infected while working on anexperimental treatment for Ebola. There were two outbreaks in monkey facilitiesin the Philippines and in Texas, with monkeys imported from the Philippines.All was calm for the next four years until 2000, when in Uganda there was anoutbreak of 425 reported cases and 224 deaths.In 2001, there was an outbreak in the Republic of the Congo with fifty-ninecases and forty-three deaths and one in Gabon with sixty-five cases andfifty-three deaths.In 2002, there was another outbreak in the Republic of the Congo with 143reported cases and 128 deaths.In 2003, an outbreak in the Republic of the Congo had thirty-five reported casesand twenty-nine deaths.In 2004, a Russian laboratory worker who was working on an Ebola vaccine wasaccidentally injected with the virus and died. In the Sudan, there wereseventeen reported cases and seven deaths.In 2005, a small outbreak occurred starting with two hunters in the Republic ofthe Congo. Twelve people were affected and there were ten deaths.No cases were reported in 2006, but in 2007 a new strain appeared in Uganda,which was significantly less lethal. There were 131 cases, but only forty-twodeaths. In the Republic of the Congo there were 264 cases and 187 deaths.In 2008, there was another small outbreak in the Republic of the Congo, withthirty-two cases and fifteen deaths. In the Philippines, the Ebola virus jumpedto pigs and infected six workers at a pig farm, but they did not developsymptoms.Nothing was reported for three more years until 2011, when a single person wasinfected with Ebola in Uganda and died.In 2012, there was an outbreak in Uganda that affected six people and causedthree deaths. In the Republic of the Congo, there was an outbreak withthirty-six cases and thirteen deaths.Nothing happened in 2013, but 2014 saw the largest number of Ebola cases ever.In the Republic of the Congo, there were sixty-nine cases and forty-nine deaths.In the West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, there were28,610 and 11,308. In Italy, there was one case of an Italian healthcare workerwho’d volunteered during the epidemic, but he survived. In Mali, an infectedtraveler brought the disease, resulting in eight cases and six deaths. InNigeria, an infected traveler was responsible for twenty cases and eight deaths.In Senegal, an infected traveler was responsible for one case, but no deaths. InSpain, a healthcare worker became infected while treating a patient evacuatedfrom Sierra Leone, but he recovered. In the United States, there were fourconfirmed cases, with two being nurses who were treating an Ebola patient onAmerican soil. One person died in the United States outbreak.Next, we jump forward three years to 2017, when there were eight cases and fourdeaths in the Republic of the Congo.In 2018, there was another outbreak in the Republic of the Congo with fifty-fourcases and thirty-three deaths. The World Health Organization declared theoutbreak over on July 24, 2018. This was the ninth recorded outbreak of Ebola inthe Republic of the Congo.In just a little over two pages, I’ve provided the approximately twenty knownoutbreaks of Ebola and a brief description of the circumstances of eachoutbreak. Now, let’s really try to consider what’s happening.image [../Images/common.jpg]Let’s leave aside for a moment the question of why this disease suddenlyappeared in 1976. Instead let’s focus on the ten instances of Ebola appearing inanimal or scientific facilities.In 1989, there was an outbreak of Ebola at a primate facility in thePhilippines.In 1989, there was an outbreak of Ebola at primate facilities in Virginia andPennsylvania.In 1990, there was an Ebola outbreak at monkey quarantine facilities in Virginiaand Texas.In 1996, a Russian lab worker was infected with Ebola while working on anexperimental treatment.In 1996, there was an Ebola outbreak in monkey facilities in the Philippines.In 1996, there was an outbreak of Ebola at monkey facilities in Texas withmonkeys imported from the Philippines.In 2004, there was another laboratory worker in Russia who was accidentallyinjected with the virus and died.In 2008, the Ebola virus somehow made a jump into pigs and from there infectedsix workers, but none of them developed symptoms.Is it just my imagination, or are some of the most likely places on Earth tocontract Ebola a scientific lab or hanging around with monkeys in cages,presumably in unhealthy conditions? Not monkeys in the wild.Let’s move onto the West African outbreak.In a little bit of research, we came across an interesting account written byHong Kong-based journalist and former editor of The Japan Times in Tokyo,science writer Yoichi Shimatsu.The mystery at the heart of the Ebola outbreak is how the 1995 Zaire (ZEBOV)strain, which originated in Central Africa some 4,000 km to the east inCongolese (Zairean) provinces of Central Africa, managed to suddenly resur-facenow a decade later in Guinea, West Africa. Since no evidence of Ebola infectionsin transit has been detected at airports, ports or highways, the initialinfections must have come from either one of either two alternative routes . . .The reason for suspecting a vaccine campaign rather than an individual carrieris due to the fact that the Ebola contagion did not start at a single geographiccenter and then spread outward along the roads. Instead, simultaneous outbreaksof multiple cases occurred in widely separated parts of rural Guinea, indicatinga highly organized effort to infect residents in different locations in the sametime frame.The Ebola outbreak in Early March coincided with three separate vaccinationcampaigns countrywide: a cholera oral vaccine effort by Medicins Sans Frontieresunder the WHO; and UNICEF-funded prevention programs against meningitis andpolio.14 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn9_14]Let’s just say that these claims might not be able to be substantiated.However, it seems clear to me that there were three separate vaccinationcampaigns PRIOR to the West African Ebola outbreak. You simply have to consultnews accounts to learn about all of these vaccination campaigns.Maybe that was a coincidence. I don’t believe in coincidences.image [../Images/common.jpg]I’ve talked about how one of the major problems with multiple vaccinations isthe so-called “war and Peace of the viruses” in which each virus preoccupies adifferent part of the immune system, leading to a compromised immune system. Igive you this publication from the CDC titled “Emergence of Vaccine-DerivedPolioviruses during Ebola Virus Disease Outbreak, Guinea, 2014–2015.” Did youcatch that term “Vaccine-Derived Polioviruses”? And it happened during an Ebolaoutbreak. Not among those who came down with the disease, but simply in thecommunity. The abstract reads:During the 2014–2015 outbreak of Ebola virus disease in Guinea, 13 type 2circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs) were isolated from 6 poliopatients and 7 healthy contact. To clarify the genetic properties of cVDPVs andtheir emergence, we combined epidemiologic and virologic data for polio cases inGuinea. Deviation of public health resources to the Ebola outbreak disruptedpolio vaccination programs and surveillance activities, which fueled the spreadof neurovirulent VDPVs in an area of low vaccination coverage and immunity.15[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn9_15]There are times when my dear colleagues in science make me want to bang my headagainst a wall. Let’s take that final sentence from the abstract: “Deviation ofpublic health resources to the Ebola outbreak disrupted polio vaccinationprograms and surveillance activities, which fueled the spread of neurovirulentVDPVs in an area of low vaccination coverage and immunity.”Let’s translate that mumbo-jumbo into something understandable. Then you’llrealize how that sentence makes no sense.It should read something like this: “Because of the Ebola outbreak we couldn’tgive our polio vaccines, and that promoted the spread of polio viruses from ourvaccines.” Really, I encourage you to come up with any other translation.Here’s what it really means to me. Our vaccines are generating new viruses, andin areas with low immune function, think poor and impoverished (or they’regetting so many vaccinations that their immune system is going haywire trying tokeep up), we’re making sure these people will get some type of serious viraldiseases like HIV, Ebola, or Zika.image [../Images/common.jpg]Probably no name is more associated with the West African outbreak of Ebola thanDr. Kent Brantley, the US doctor who was working in Liberia during the outbreak,contracted Ebola, and was flown back to the United States for treatment andrecovered. I have a great deal of respect for Dr. Brantley, a strong Christianwho believes his ministry is healing people, and I found the account of hisordeal in the book Called for Life to mirror many of my own beliefs.In the prologue to the book, Brantley wrote, “For the thirty-eight years sinceEbola Virus Disease had been identified, every outbreak had been limited tosmall rural communities. This time, however, was different. This time, Ebola hadfound the perfect storm of factors, quickly spreading through three countriesand into major urban centers.”16 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn9_16] Farther on, hisaccount of the number of outbreaks is in accord with what I understand: “Therehad been fewer than twenty Ebola episodes since the virus was first identifiedin 1976. . . . The most deaths from an Ebola outbreak had been 280 in Zaire in1976.”17 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn9_17]As to what caused the outbreak to be so severe in West Africa, Brantley writesabout the main city of Monrovia in Liberia: “In the city, there was limitedaccess to clean water, so many people could not practice proper hygiene.”18[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn9_18] I would also add that West Africa has beenthrough years of instability with various wars, leaving the people in anutritionally depleted state and vulnerable to pathogens that might beactivated.When Dr. Brantley was diagnosed with Ebola, he contacted somebody he hadrecently met, Dr. Randy Schoepp, chief of diagnostics with USAMRIID. You’llforgive me, but after what I’ve learned over the years about what militaryinfectious medical researchers do from my experiences at Fort Detrick, I’m alittle wary of any individuals in that kind of a position.Schoepp went through the options with Brantley, eventually settling on acocktail of antibodies that were believed to target the Ebola virus. This iswhat Brantley wrote, and I’m sure you’ll understand immediately what concerns meso much:Because the drug had not been administered to a human, there was no way ofknowing whether it was safe. The serum was derived from a mouse antibody andgrown in tobacco plants. It is a type of monoclonal antibody. I knew thatmonoclonal antibodies were engineered in laboratories to imitate antibodiesnaturally produced as part of the body’s immune system. That type of treatmenthad been employed to treat other conditions, and as far as I knew they weregenerally considered to be safe.19 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn9_19]Yes, we’ve got our lovely little mouse again, and we don’t know what viruses aresleeping in that little rodent, ready to wake up and wreak havoc on the humanimmune system. And all of that faith in biological products that are “engineeredin laboratories” and “generally considered to be safe” is just a little out ofmy comfort zone. Still, if I’m looking at likely death from Ebola, I’ll take theoption that gives me the best chance for survival.But we need to know how the whole disaster got started. We owe that to humanity.I think the heart of this darkness lies not in the African jungles, but in ourown research labs. We play God without telling the truth about our failures.image [../Images/common.jpg]But there is little appetite for doing good science about vaccines. Instead, thescientific media simply wants to shout down anybody who asks questions. Whathappened to persuasion as the appropriate method of civil discourse in oursociety? When did we suddenly become authoritarian? When did dialogue andlistening to one another become a sign of weakness?Consider this recent article from Scientific American on March 21, 2019. Thetitle is “Opting Out of Vaccines Should Opt You Out of American Society.”20[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn9_20] The subheading reads, “People who are able totake vaccines but refuse to do so are the moral equivalent of drunk drivers.”Wow, that’s an amazing moral comparison. I guess all my years of scientificstudy and research have made me drunk with curiosity!Here’s a sad sample of what passes for discussion in what used to be one of thepremier magazines for discussion of scientific progress:There is no moral difference between a drunk driver and a willfully unvaccinatedperson. Both are selfishly, recklessly and knowingly putting the lives ofeveryone they encounter at risk. Their behavior endangers the health, safety andlivelihood of the innocent bystanders who happen to have the misfortune of beingin their path.The reasons why are simple and straightforward. Vaccines aren’t perfect (e.g.,they can wear off over time) and not everyone can be vaccinated. There is oneand only one reason to skip a vaccine: being immunocompromised. Someindividuals, because of genetic deficiencies or diseases like cancer, cannotreceive vaccines. Other people are too young. Vaccines such as MMR (measles,mumps, rubella) cannot be administered before 12 months of age.21[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn9_21]As a person trained in the skill of scientific argumentation, the two quotedparagraphs are almost painful to read. The first paragraph has nothingsubstantial in it, just fearmongering. Let’s move onto the second paragraph.Vaccines aren’t perfect. Big understatement.But what do they discuss as the only problem? They wear off over time. That’skind of like saying the only thing wrong with chocolate is that when you finisheating it, there’s nothing left. I’d like a little more discussion.Color me a curious scientist.Just to be brief about the issue, I think one of the major problems withvaccines is that they’re grown in animal tissues and we don’t know what virusesand pathogens are coming back in the needle. A recent inquiry in December 2018by the Italian lab, Corvela, on the GlaxoSmithKline vaccine Priorix Tertahighlights troubling problems that our technology can now uncover but that fewseem to have the courage to investigate. Translated from the Italian, the reportfinds:We have continued the investigation, both chemical and biological, on the PrioxTetra, quadrivalent against measles, rubella, mumps, and varicella. We havefound . . . proteobacteria and nematoda worms, 10 other viruses through ssRNA,Microviridae (bacterial or phage viruses) and numerous retroviruses includingendogenous human and avian retroviruses, avian viruses, human immunodeficiencyand immunodeficiency virus of monkeys (fragments that if inserted into thedatabase detect fragments of HIV and SIV), murine virus, horse infectious anemiavirus, lymphoproliferative disease virus, Rous sarcoma virus, alphaendornavirus,hepatitis B virus, and yeast virus.22 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn9_22]The technology exists to answer the question of how many different viruses arecontaminating our typical vaccines. Look at the problems with this singlevaccine. There are indications of viruses from humans, birds, monkeys, mice, andhorses, all animals that we use in one way or another in vaccine production. Andwhat about the worms, yeast, and other microorganisms that naturally occur inanimal tissue?If you eliminate the animal tissue, that leaves aborted human fetal tissue, andI think there are significant moral and scientific issues with what happens on agenetic level when you inject human tissue into the bloodstream. Then you get tothe issue of chemicals in the vaccines, like mercury, aluminum, formaldehyde,polysorbate 80, and a host of others, and it begins to look like a witch’s brewthat would only be given to children in some demented fairy tale.Personally, I feel like I’m one of the few sober drivers on the road when itcomes to the question of vaccines and human health."},{"pageContent":"images [../Images/line.jpg]CHAPTER TENMy Coauthor Gets Banned from Australiaimages [../Images/line.jpg]Sometimes you need a little levity, or you’ll just go crazy.I’m happy that my coauthor, Kent, even though he lives a difficult life with aseverely autistic daughter, keeps me laughing at the absurdity of much of whatis going on in science today, and specifically in the scientific press.If I didn’t know any better, I’d claim he was an undiscovered member of thesatirical English group, Monty Python, since, as in their movie Life of Brian, aparody of the Jesus Christ story, I imagine him whistling the song “Always Lookon the Bright Side of Life,” even as he’s being crucified in the media.Do you think I’m kidding?Let me tell you a story.image [../Images/common.jpg]Science is supposed to work in a certain predictable way.A hypothesis is made, then it’s investigated in an objective manner. If the datacan be replicated, it becomes an accepted fact. If not, then the hypothesis isdisproven.This isn’t always the case. Controversies and scientists with diametricallydifferent findings have erupted in many fields, such as the health effects ofsmoking, leaded gasoline, pesticides, and the possible negative reactions ofcertain pharmaceutical drugs.One might say when large amounts of money are involved, the truth is in danger.In 1998, Dr. Andrew Wakefield and eleven other authors published a blockbusterarticle in The Lancet, a well-known medical journal, alleging a possibleassociation between the MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine, the development ofautism, and a specific type of gastrointestinal problem. In other words, thevaccine was doing something that affected the gut, which in turn was affectingthe brain. Despite what you may think you know about Dr. Wakefield, if you’veever used the expression “gut-brain connection,” meaning there’s a link betweendigestive issues and mental health, you have Dr. Wakefield to thank for thatcontribution to science. As Dr. Wakefield explained to Kent:The paper described clinical findings in twelve children with an autisticspectrum disorder (ASD) occurring in association with a mild-to-moderateinflammation of the lymph glands in the intestinal lining (lymphoid nodularhyperplasia), predominantly in the last part of the small intestine (terminalileum). Contemporaneously, parents of nine children associated onset of symptomswith measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine exposure, eight of whom were reportedon the original paper.1 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn10_1]On January 28, 2010, after years of heated controversy, the General MedicalCouncil of Great Britain found Dr. Wakefield guilty of unethical behavior in hisresearch. Despite the accusations of fraud made in the media, the claim againstDr. Wakefield in the complaint was for “callous disregard” of children forsubmitting them to the standard tests for gastrointestinal problems. When Dr.Wakefield was struck off the register of physicians in May of that year, this iswhat the Daily Mail reported about the case:The panel said he behaved unethically and showed “callous disregard” for anydistress of pain the children might suffer.2 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn10_2]The children underwent typical gastro-intestinal tests, such as colonos-copies,lumbar punctures, and barium meals, in addition to urine tests. All of this isstandard practice, but to the experts of the General Medical Council it was akinto torture.The panel ruled that many of the children should never have been included in theresearch. It also found that Dr. Wakefield and his colleagues had not beengranted ethical approval to use the children in their research.Professor Terrence Stephenson, President of the Royal College of Pediatrics andChild Health, said Dr. Wakefield’s research had caused “untold damage.”3[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn10_3]Does that make any sense to you?If a physician thinks there may be problems in your gastrointestinal system,you’ll get a colonoscopy. Just ask any man over the age of fifty. That’s whenyou’re supposed to get your first one. Okay, and a urine test is among thosethings that are supposed to cause “pain and distress”?None of the tests given to the children were outside the standard of practicefor suspected gastrointestinal problems.And as a later appeal found, ethical approval had been given for those children.They were being treated for gastrointestinal problems, for God’s sake! Does onerefuse to look at data because they were obtained in the course of treatment?That’s called standard medical practice.Dr. Wakefield was not stripped of his license because of fraud. If you believethe reporting on this issue, he was stripped of his license because he orderedsome unnecessary tests.And in addition, even though it was the longest and most costly hearing in themore than 150-year history of the General Medical Council, none of the parentscould testify in support of Dr. Wakefield.In fact, the Council did not allow any of the parents to speak.How can you be a supervillain if there are no victims?image [../Images/common.jpg]One might ask what happened in the twelve-year interval between the publicationof Wakefield’s article in The Lancet and being struck off the register ofphysicians in 2010. Surely there were some high-level investigations byindependent investigators into the claim of an autism risk from the MMR vaccine?The answer would be, yes, there was a high-level investigation by the Centersfor Disease Control (CDC), published in 2004, and known as the DeStefano paper,after the lead author, Frank DeStefano. Surprisingly, the study did show anincreased risk, but below the level necessary to ring any causation alarm bells.But in November 2013, a remarkable thing took place. Dr. Brian Hooker, an autismparent and longtime critic of the CDC for what he believed to be a lack oftransparency on the issue, was contacted by Dr. William Thompson, one of theauthors of the DeStefano MMR study.Apparently, Thompson had been carrying a great secret for many years.Thompson claimed that their research uncovered an association between earlieradministration of the MMR vaccine and rates of autism, particularly amongAfrican American males. Hooker didn’t want this potential whistle-blower tovanish into the night, so Hooker contacted an attorney to see how he mightlegally record these conversations.Hooker was told that the laws of Washington State allowed one party in atelephone conversation to record what was being said, so Hooker traveled severaltimes from his home in the far north of California to a location in WashingtonState. Once Hooker had several taped conversations, he contacted Dr. AndrewWakefield, who had devoted himself to fighting for children with autism andclearing his name.This was bombshell material.Eventually, they would work with Del Bigtree, an Emmy-winning Hollywoodtelevision producer who had worked on The Dr. Phil Show as well as the medicaltalk show The Doctors. This group would go on to produce a documentary aboutthis case titled VAXXED: From Cover-Up to Conspiracy. The relationship betweenHooker and Thompson grew so close that Hooker was able to convince Thompson toapply for federal whistle-blower protection and release a statement through hisattorney to the press about his claims.Thompson had been deeply troubled over the years by what he had been forced toconceal and lamented at times to Hooker that now whenever he saw an autisticchild, he felt guilty and responsible.The trove of documents Thompson had retained was turned over to CongressmanWilliam Posey (R) Florida, who offered to make them available to any interestedjournalist. My coauthor applied for and was granted access to those documents,eventually writing a book about the Thompson case and other aspects of thevaccine issue titled INOCULATED: How Science Lost Its Soul in Autism. It’s afine book, and I suggest you read it.To me it’s more terrifying than any Stephen King novel.Thompson would eventually write a long and detailed confession for CongressmanPosey. Here is the concluding section, in Dr. Thompson’s own words, about howthe CDC actively covered up evidence of a linkage between the MMR vaccine andautism in the years between 2001 and 2004:I believe we intentionally withheld controversial findings from the final draftof the De Stefano et al (2004) Pediatrics paper. We failed to follow the finalapproved study protocol and we ran detailed in depth RACE analyses from October2001 through August 2002 attempting to understand why we were finding largevaccine effects for blacks. The fact that we found a strong statisticallysignificant finding among black males does not mean there was a true associationbetween the MMR vaccine and autism-like features in this subpopulation.This result would probably have led to designing additional better studies if wehad been willing to report the findings in the study and the manuscript at thetime we found them. The significant effect of early vaccination with the MMRmight also have been a proxy for the receipt of thimerosal vaccine early in lifebut we didn’t have the appropriate data to be able to code the level ofthimerosal exposure from the MADDSP school records.In addition to significant effects for black males, we also found significanteffects for “isolated autism cases” and for the threshold of 24 months of age.If we had reported the 24 month effects, our justification for ignoring the 36month significant effects would not have been supported. In the discussionsection of the final published manuscript, we took the position that serviceseeking was the reason we found a statistically significant effect at 36 months.This was a post-hoc hypothesis regarding the findings after we confirmed one ofour primary hypotheses.4 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn10_4]Leading scientists at the CDC charged with ensuring the safety of vaccines knewbeyond a shadow of doubt in 2004 that earlier administration of the MMR vaccinewas leading to increased rates of autism in African American males and to alesser extent among the population at large. It is difficult to imagine agreater crime against the health of the public.It seems to me that Thompson details five specific lies in his confession.The first lie is the failure to report a significant effect for African Americanmales who received an MMR vaccine at twelve months instead of thirty-six months.The second lie is the failure to report significant effects for “isolated autismcases,” meaning the sudden and unexpected development of autism in children withno previous behavioral or health problems.The third lie is the failure to report significant effects for those childrenwhom received the MMR vaccine at twenty-four months rather than twelve orthirty-six months.The fourth lie is that even with the removal of a significant number ofAfrican-American boys with autism from the study because they did not have aGeorgia birth certificate, a statistically significant effect remained, but theyclaimed this was likely because of a result of “service-seeking” and a mythicalregulation that a condition of such services was the earlier administration ofthe MMR shot.The fifth lie was that by omitting all of this information, it lowered concernabout damage caused to children of all races from the MMR vaccine. All of thistook place within the 2001–2004 time frame.Would Wakefield have been the subject of an inquiry by the General MedicalCouncil in 2010 if the CDC scientists had honestly reported their findings in2004?Probably not.Would Frank and I have been attacked so viciously from 2010 to 2012 for myconcern about the role vaccines and retroviruses might be playing in thedevelopment of autism?Probably not.Dr. Thompson continues to work at the CDC and has been waiting to be called totestify in front of Congress. Because of the stranglehold the pharmaceuticalcompanies have on our elected representatives, I doubt his story will ever beshared by the mainstream media.image [../Images/common.jpg]There are a few individuals in Congress who have tried to raise questions aboutvaccines. Even if these members of Congress hold great power in other spheres,it seems that when they start talking about vaccines, they get no coverage fromthe media. Former Congressman Dan Burton did great work, as well as Congressmanand physician Dave Weldon. Current Congressman Bill Posey continues to try andget this story out to the public.On July 29, 2015, Posey took to the floor of the House of Representatives tospeak about the active concealment of the CDC regarding this information. He wasonly given five minutes to speak, but he packed in a great deal.Mr. Speaker, I rise today on matters of research and scientific integrity.To begin with, I am absolutely, resolutely pro-vaccine. Advancements in medicalimmunization have saved countless lives and greatly benefited public health.That being said, it is troubling to me that, in a recent Senate hearing onchildhood vaccinations, it was never mentioned that our government has paid outover three billion dollars through the National Vaccine Injury CompensationProgram for children who have been injured by vaccinations.Regardless of the subject matter, parents making decisions about theirchildren’s health deserve to have the best information available to them. Theyshould be able to count on Federal agencies to tell them the truth.For these reasons, I bring the following matter to the House floor. In August2014, Dr. William Thompson, a senior scientist at the Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention, worked with a whistleblower attorney to provide myoffice with documents related to a 2004 CDC study that examined the possibilityof a relationship between the mumps, measles, and rubella vaccine and autism.In a statement released in August of 2014, Dr. Thompson stated: “I regret thatmy coauthors and I omitted statistically significant information in our 2004article published in the Journal of Pediatrics.”Mr. Speaker, also quoting Dr. Thompson:My primary job duties while working in the immunization safety branch from 2000to 2006 were to lead or co-lead three major vaccine safety studies. The MADDSPMMR-Autism Cases Control Study was being carried out in response to theWakefield Lancet study that suggested an association between the MMR vaccine andan autism-like health outcome.There were several major concerns among scientists and consumer advocatesoutside the CDC in the fall of 2000 regarding the execution of the Verstraetenstudy.One of the important goals that was determined upfront in the spring of 2001before any of these studies started was to have all three protocols vettedoutside the CDC prior to the start of the analyses so that consumer advocatescould not claim that we were presenting analyses that suited our own goals andbiases.We hypothesized that if we found statistically significant effects at either18-or 36-month thresholds, we would conclude that vaccinating children earlywith MMR vaccine could lead to autism-like characteristics or features.We all met and finalized the study protocol and analysis plan. The goal was notto deviate from the analysis plan to avoid the debacle that occurred with theVerstraeten Thimerosal study published in Pediatrics in 2003.At the September 5 meeting, we discussed in detail how to code race for both thesample and the birth certificate sample. At the bottom of table 7, it also showsthat for the nonbirth certificate sample, the adjusted race effect statisticalsignificance was huge.All the authors and I met and decided sometime between August and September 2002not to report any race effects for the paper. Sometime soon after the meeting,where we decided to exclude reporting any race effects, the coauthors scheduleda meeting to destroy documents related to the study.The remaining four co-authors all met and brought a big garbage can into themeeting room and reviewed and went through all the hard copy documents that wehad thought we should discard and put them into a huge garbage can.However, because I assumed it was illegal and would violate both FOIA and DOJrequests, I kept hard copies of all documents in my office, and I retained allassociated computer files.I believe we intentionally withheld controversial findings from the final draftof the Pediatrics paper.Mr. Speaker, I believe it is our duty to ensure that the documents Dr. Thompsonprovided are not ignored; therefore, I will provide them to Members of Congressand the House Committees upon request.Considering the nature of the whistleblower’s documents, as well as theinvolvement of the CDC, a hearing and a thorough investigation is warranted.I ask, Mr. Speaker, I beg, I implore my colleagues on the Committee onAppropriations to please, take such action.5 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn10_5]Congressman Posey might as well have been speaking in that proverbial forest inwhich no person hears the fall of a tree, for all the media coverage generatedby his remarks.Posey eventually made his documents available to any member of the press whorequested them. As far as I know, my coauthor, Kent, is the only one who everrequested them. Maybe Sharyl Attkisson asked for them as well, I don’t know.Let’s review what Thompson had to say.He had management responsibilities for three major vaccine safety studies forthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. I think that would qualify himas an expert to discuss the reliability of the government’s science.Thompson relates that the study design was created and approved with the inputof scientists and consumer advocates. Got it? Both scientists and the parents ofvaccine-injured family agreed on the study design.When they looked at earlier and later administrations of the MMR vaccine, theyfound a statistically significant race effect, which was in his words was“huge.”These five scientists at the CDC decided not to report the race effects fromearlier administration of the MMR vaccine. And let’s not forget, they were onlylooking at children who got an earlier dose of the MMR vaccine and those who gota later dose. Anybody with just a passing familiarity with science knows that inorder to have a valid study you need to have a control group.What does that mean?It means you need to have a group of children who didn’t get the MMR shot. Thestudy they did is equivalent to looking for lung cancer rates among those whosmoked one pack of cigarettes a day versus those who smoked two packs ofcigarettes a day.And just because I happen to believe that scientists should be thorough in theirinvestigations, how about a study looking at a group of fully vaccinated kidsand another group who did not get any vaccines? If you believe the CDC, the moreeducated and affluent you are, and the more you research vaccines, the morelikely you are to alter the schedule.As if it weren’t bad enough that these five CDC scientists decided to cover upthis information, they even made a Saturday afternoon date to destroyinformation.How could this possibly be any worse? Can there be any bigger news story in theworld than children being harmed when they walk into their pediatrician’soffice?When the government investigated vaccines and thimerosal in the 2000–2003 timeperiod, they found an increase in neurological problems, as the Verstraetenstudy showed. But of course, they washed that data to make the signal go away,triggering what they euphemistically called a “controversy.” It weren’t a“controversy,” it was a crime.When the government investigated the MMR vaccine and autism in the 2001–2004time period, they found an effect, but they decided to cover it up, even goingso far as to come into the CDC on a Saturday and try to throw away all theincriminating evidence into a large garbage can. We only know about this becauseof Dr. William Thompson’s revelation from 2014, more than ten years after theseincidents took place.In 2007, the government’s own medical expert in the Vaccine Court, Dr. AndrewZimmerman, told the government that vaccines were causing autism in somechildren. Less than forty-eight hours after he provided this information, thegovernment kicked him off the case. We only know this because of an affidavitZimmerman signed in 2018.Let’s just say it.Every time the government investigates vaccines, they find problems and theymake the decision to cover up the information.image [../Images/common.jpg]And now we come to the Australia part of the story.After Dr. Brian Hooker contacted Dr. Andrew Wakefield about the allegations ofDr. William Thompson, they made a documentary film about the case called VAXXED:From Cover-Up to Catastrophe, which featured several of the legally recordedconversations between Dr. Thompson and Dr. Brian Hooker. One of the producerswas an Englishwoman, Polly Tommey, the mother of an autistic child and cofounderof Autism File magazine. Kent had written several articles for Autism File, sohe had an acquaintance with Polly.The film was controversial to people who never actually sat in a theater andwatched it, most famously being accepted into the prestigious Tribeca FilmFestival, then getting disinvited when protests were made to festival founderRobert De Niro. So much for artistic freedom! It was not De Niro’s finest hour.It was revealed at the time that De Niro had an eighteen-year-old son withautism, and his wife said he changed after a vaccination. Apparently, De Nirohad been away filming and didn’t feel he could comment with any accuracy on hiswife’s claim. Way to support your wife! Perhaps it does not come as a surprisethat Mr. De Niro and his wife broke up a few years later?The VAXXED crew took their documentary to Australia, only to find themselvesharassed by the press and government, who hadn’t expected an antivaccinationfilm to land in their country. The media and government harassment were gamechangers for the tour, since before the attacks they hadn’t been selling manytickets. After the media firestorm, they sold out all the venues.The Australian government wasn’t done with the VAXXED crew. When they went toleave the country, they were detained by immigration while their materials weresearched and photographed. Since content was obviously not what they werelooking for, perhaps it was links or information on their own indigenousanti-vaxxers. At the airport, as they were finishing up with immigration, one ofthe agents told Polly Tommey, “If we’d known you were coming, we wouldn’t havelet you in the country.”When he heard about this, Kent quickly dialed Polly, reaching her in NewZealand, and conducted a quick interview for an article in Bolen Report, wherehe regularly writes. Polly told Kent, “We were in the papers every day. They’retheir own worst enemy. They promoted the fact we were in Australia and the talksthe whole time. If they had shut up, no one would have even known we were there.They did this to themselves. And the more they kept saying VAXXED is dangerousand a pack of lies, of course, the more people wanted to see it. They wereidiots to promote us like they did. We were nowhere near sold out before wearrived. But the minute we were in Australia and the press got the story, wesold out every venue. We were packed and had a waiting list of people wanting tosee VAXXED.”6 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn10_6]All of this gave Kent an idea.I learned long ago that Kent and an idea are an interesting combination.image [../Images/common.jpg]Even though Kent had no interest in traveling to Australia, he applied for avisa to travel there on a series of speaking engagements, which he dubbed the“Dangerous Science” tour. He had no speeches scheduled, venues, and hadn’t evencontacted a single person in Australia. He announced it with great fanfare inthe pages of Bolen Report, even publishing an open letter to Australian PrimeMinister Malcolm Turnbull detailing his planned visit and what he hoped toaccomplish. This is what my trouble-making coauthor wrote:Dear Prime Minister Turnbull:I am very excited to visit your country in December of 2017 on my “DangerousScience” tour in which I will be discussing my two books, PLAGUE: OneScientist’s Intrepid Search for the Truth About Retroviruses and INOCULATED: HowScience Lost its Soul in Autism. I will also be discussing my recent efforts tobring about a FIVE-YEAR MORATORIUM ON CHILDHOOD VACCINES in the United Statesthrough both a White House and FDA/CDC petition by way of the AdministrativePractices Act.If you wish to obtain more information about this effort, you can go totinyurl.com/vaccine [http://tinyurl.com/vaccine] moratorium.Since you are not an American citizen, you cannot sign either of the petitions.I wouldn’t want you to get in trouble, but perhaps it might give you some ideasfor similar legislation in Australia.I understand there is a great deal of confusion over the nomenclature among manyin our community, with some wishing to be “pro-safe vaccine” or “vaccinesafety”, but after much study in this field, I think I should simply be referredto as the “World’s #1 Anti-Vaxxer.” I understand there are others who may feelthey deserve the title, and I am happy to share it, but let’s simply use it forthe sake of convenience.I think you would find my book, INOCULATED: How Science Lost its Soul in Autism,to be especially revealing as it is based on documents provided to me by USCongressman William Posey, who in turn received these documents fromwhistle-blower, Dr. William Thompson, a vaccine safety scientist at our Centersfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Thompson is currently waiting to becalled to testify in front of the House Oversight and Government ReformCommittee in our Congress. He has been waiting for three years. I hope thingsmove quicker in Australia, especially considering Thompson’s testimony about howthe MMR vaccine is devastating our African-American population. I imagine it isalso doing the same to your aboriginal population.My intention in coming to Australia is to make both PLAGUE and INOCULATED thetwo best-selling books in Australian history, as well as to create a movementfor a similar Australian FIVE-YEAR MORATORIUM ON CHILDHOOD VACCINES.If you wish to greet me at the airport when I land, I would be amenable to suchan effort, or if you think our meeting should be at The Lodge, the primaryresidence of the Prime Minister, I would accept that as well. After all, I willbe a guest in your country.Please don’t make too much of a fuss over my efforts, but if you would like togive me an award in recognition of my work to liberate Australia from the gripof the pharmaceutical industry, I like the sound of The Order of Australia,Officer of the Order. Maybe it’s the imperialist in me, but it just sounds soregal.I’m also enclosing two articles for your review, “Australia Bans Autism Mom asan ‘ENEMY OF THE STATE’” (Bolen Report, August 10, 2017) and “KentHeckenlively—World’s #1 Anti-Vaxxer” (Bolen Report, August 8, 2017) so you willhave greater familiarity with my work.I look forward to visiting your beautiful country and meeting the brave citizensof Australia!Your humble servant,Kent HeckenlivelyP.S.—I really LOVE your new automated visa application form. I should already beapproved by the time you get this letter. Throw a shrimp on the barbie for me,mate!7 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn10_7]Kent thought it was a funny piece that would be appreciated by his fellowmembers in the health freedom community but never expected it to become aninternational story plastered in papers across the globe.image [../Images/common.jpg]The response was swift and hilarious.In the Sydney Morning Herald on August 31, 2017, there was a screaming headlinethat pronounced, “‘World’s Number 1 Anti-Vaxxer’ Kent Heckenlively Denied Entryto Australia.” The article read:The self-proclaimed “world’s number one anti-vaxxer” has been denied permissionto visit Australia.Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said on Thursday Kent Heckenlively would notbe able to tour Australia later this year as part of an international campaigncalling for a pause in childhood vaccinations.“We’re not going to allow him to come here,” Mr. Dutton told Sydney radiostation 2GB.“These people who are telling parents that their kids shouldn’t be vaccinatedare dangerous. We have been very careful in having a look right through thisparticular case and it’s clear to me that it’s not in our national interest thathe should come here.”8 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn10_8]Wow, so you can be a socialist in America, committed to the overthrow of thecapitalist system, get elected to the United States Congress, and dominate theDemocratic Party. I’m sure that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez would have no problemgetting a visa to Australia. But let somebody question a pharmaceutical productmade by a company that contributes massive amounts of money to media companiesand politicians, and even the immigration minister of the country will getinvolved.The story of Kent’s banning from Australia was covered not just in Australianpapers, but on the BBC, the English newspaper The Guardian, the InternationalBusiness Times, Buzzfeed in America, and the South China Post. There are morethan five hundred news articles you can find on Kent and Australia in Googlenews. Maybe that’s a healthy discussion, but Kent has never received a singlephone call from any of those national and international newspapers asking forhis side of the story, let alone a comment.The documents received by Kent from the Australian government were interesting,as it appeared the country had originally granted his application but then laterrescinded the approval. In a letter he received on August 31, 2017, it read:“Dear Mr. Heckenlively, I wish to advise you that your subclass 601 ElectronicTravel Authority (ETA) visa granted on 13 August 2017 was cancelled on 31 August2017 under section 128 of the Migration Act 1958 (‘the Migration Act’).”9[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn10_9]As I read the response, it seems Kent’s visa was approved on August 13, thenrescinded more than two weeks later.It may seem a little dry to quote extensively from a bureaucratic document, butit’s critical because these are the rules under which governments are decidingwhich conversations are allowed to take place. Please be aware that Kent hasnever been convicted of a crime, and everybody who meets him considers him kindand well spoken.On 14 August 2017 the Department received information from Mr. Heckenlivelystating that he intended to tour Australia in December 2017 to promote his viewson anti-vaccination and promote his anti-vaccination books.Open source information indicates that Mr. Heckenlively also plans to discussduring his tour of Australia how the pharmaceutical industry and governmententities have made human lives more dangerous. He is also quoted as saying heregards himself as the “World’s Number One Anti-Vaxxer.”Open source information from the scientific and medical fraternities inAustralia states that vaccinations are essential to ensure the health of theAustralian community is protected, and that the Australian community’s healthwould be seriously threatened without the immunization program conducted inAustralia. The Australian Government’s Immunize Australia Program funds freevaccination programs, administers the Childhood Immunization Register andprovides information to the Australian public and health professionals.The Commonwealth Department of Health’s website provides that immunization isthe safest and most effective way of protecting children against disease andwith sufficient numbers of people immunized in the Australian community helpsprevent the spread of these diseases, or is eliminated altogether.Based on this information, I am satisfied that Mr. Heckenlively’s intentions topromote his views on anti-vaccination would or might be a risk to the good orderof the Australian community.10 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn10_10]My dear coauthor, Kent, is a threat to the “good order” of a strong and thrivingdemocracy? He’s listened to me for countless hours and written books withhundreds of footnotes to support his claims. And he gets ridiculed by his familyfor driving the speed limit, uses the crosswalk when crossing the street, andflosses every night. The book he wrote about corruption in the vaccine programof the CDC was based on documents he received from the United States Congress.He is advocating for good science being applied to looking at the effects ofvaccination, an investigation that is not currently being done.Now, the Australian authorities might say Kent acted a little disrespectfully inhis letter. We know the leader of any country should be addressed as “Your MostHigh and Exalted Excellency and Ruler of All.”That’s just proper diplomacy.And he did call for a naval blockade of the country until democracy wasrestored, as well as the provision of nonlethal aid to the Australian anti-vaxxrebels. But those last two calls were issued only AFTER they banned him fromAustralia. And before issuing these calls, Kent did send them a copy of his bookINOCULATED: How Science Lost its Soul in Autism and asked them to point out anyerrors of fact that rendered him unworthy of traveling to Australia.And he did threaten in an article to secretly travel to Australia under a falsename and wearing a disguise, which in truth was a pair of phony black-rimmedglasses with a big nose and bushy eyebrows. He even published a photo of himselfin the planned disguise in front of a map of Australia but instructed all hisreaders not to let the Australian authorities know.The government did not initiate any further contact with Kent.But the final indignity was yet to come.image [../Images/common.jpg]Kent was in Florida, where his wife was going to be running a half-marathon withanother member of her family, when he got a call from his brother in California.Kent’s brother was laughing so hard over the phone that Kent could barely makeout what he was saying.“R. Kelly got banned from Australia,” Kent could finally understand what hisbrother telling him. “It’s in the Sacramento Bee.”Kent had some vague recollection that R. Kelly was a musician who’d been accusedof inappropriate behavior with young girls. “Okay, so what does that have to dowith me?”“They mention you in the article about R. Kelly!” he was eventually able to saythrough the laughter.Kent quickly went to the Internet and typed in his name along with R. Kelly andfound an article from the Hollywood Reporter:Kelly’s career has been stifled since a #MuteRKelly campaign gained momentumlast year to protest his alleged sexual abuse of women and girls, which Kellydenies. Lifetime’s documentary series Surviving R. Kelly last month drew evenmore attention to the allegations, and his record label has reportedly droppedhim.Australia has denied entry to other foreigners on character grounds, among themtroubled R&B singer Chris Brown, convicted classified document leaker ChelseaManning, anti-vaxxer Kent Heckenlively and Gavin McInnes, founder of theall-male far-right group Proud Boys.11 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn10_11]The full-blown media assault on my coauthor had reached its apparent peak. As ifit weren’t enough to claim he was a threat to the “good order” of Australia, hewas now lumped together with alleged sexual abuser R. Kelly, convicted domesticabuser Chris Brown, convicted document thief Chelsea Manning (although hersentence was commuted by President Obama), and alleged member of the far-right,Gavin McInnes.Kent thought it was ridiculously funny, penning a savage satire called I Failthe Australian Character Test with R. Kelly and Chelsea Manning, in which he’djoin in together with this group in a movie titled The Dirty Half Dozenpatterned after any countless number of cheesy World War II films in which aband of misfits gets together to complete an impossible mission.12[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn10_12] In this case, it would be liberating Australiafrom the grip of the pharmaceutical industry.But Kent took it all philosophically. “Well, at least I’m still welcome in sixof the world’s seven continents,” he told me.Kent always looks on the bright side of life."},{"pageContent":"images [../Images/line.jpg]CHAPTER ELEVENThe Way Forwardimages [../Images/line.jpg]Yes, I’ve complained a lot in this book about the sorry state of science thesedays.But it’s only because we need to have an accurate sense of the problem before wecan make significant progress toward solving it.One of my favorite books and movies is Andy Weir’s The Martian. In the story,the main character, Mark Watney, an astronaut, is stuck on Mars after his crewbelieves him to be dead during a sandstorm that threatens their base, and theyblast off without him. The actor Matt Damon did a wonderful job of bringing thischaracter to life. I loved how at the end of the movie, Watney is explaining theissue of working intelligently on a challenge to a bunch of astronaut recruits.As he paces around the room, the survivor of an incredible odyssey, he says, “Atsome point, everything’s going to go south on you. Everything’s going to gosouth. And you’re going to say, ‘This is it. This is how I end.’ Now, you caneither accept that or you can get to work. That’s all it is. You just begin. Youdo the math. You solve one problem. Then you solve the next one. And then thenext. And if you solve enough problems, you get to come home.”1[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn11_1]I think we can all agree that something has gone south in the health ofhumanity. And there have been times when I’ve felt as thoroughly abandoned, asif I were the only astronaut left on an alien world. I could’ve said, “That’sit. This is how I end.”But my faith in God and my faith in science would not allow me to do that.We simply begin. We get to work. Solve one problem, then the next.If we solve enough problems, we can enter a golden age of health.image [../Images/common.jpg]Let me tell you the reality that exists now for patients.This is a patient I’ve been advising for a few years, and his story makes me asangry as anything I’ve previously shared with you. I will give him the name Seanfor purposes of this story, but it is true that he’s currently forty-two yearsold, went to a top ten Ivy League college, and, before the difficulties I’mabout to relate, pulled down over three hundred thousand dollars a year as themanager of a group of engineers at a Silicon Valley tech company.The problem first began in 2004, when he went to the hospital complaining of afever and chest pains. Tests were unrevealing, and he was given Vicodin and senthome.In 2015, he had a fever for several days, then began experiencing massive chestpains that he likened to a “massive bowling ball” smashing him in the chest.When he went to the hospital, they immediately found his blood pressure washigh, his EKG was abnormal, and they ran a blood test for troponin, which isreleased into the blood when there’s damage to cardiac tissue. Anything overzero means there are problems, while above two means you’ve suffered a heartattack. Sean’s troponin level was over fourteen.In the intensive care unit, he was diagnosed with acute myocarditis, and inSean’s opinion the team did a heroic job saving his life.After he had stabilized, a doctor came in and asked to speak to Sean away fromhis wife.Sean said anything he had to say his wife could hear, as well.The doctor then proceeded to ask Sean if he used IV drugs, had recently had ablood transfusion, or engaged in unprotected sex with women other than his wife,such as prostitutes.Sean laughed at the question. “I’m a boring software engineer. I haven’t doneany of those things.”The doctor seemed to get a little angry with Sean. “I’m trying to have a realdiscussion with you, because I think I know what you have. I’ve seen severalcases of acute myocarditis like yours, and all of those patients have AIDS.”Sean’s mind swirled at what the doctor was telling him, but none of it madesense. Finally, Sean said, “You did a lot of blood tests. I assume one of themis an HIV-AIDS test. Do you have the results?”“No, they haven’t come back yet, but they should shortly.”“Well, come back and talk to me when you have the results.”A few hours later the doctor returned. Sean did not have HIV-AIDS. The doctorwas baffled.Sean slowly recovered and after a few months tried to return to work butsuffered premature ventricular contractions after brief amounts of activity. Thedoctors ran a series of tests and found he exceeded class-three cardiacstability standards as set by the American Heart Association.Sean utilized that same relentless drive that had landed him at an Ivy Leagueuniversity and followed him through his previous jobs at five Silicon Valleystart-ups. He eventually found an excellent transplant cardiologist who knew agreat deal about acute myocarditis, since many patients end up needing a hearttransplant.The transplant cardiologist did a thorough medical review, trying to findsomething that had been missed, when he came across a troubling finding. “Weknow the five-year survival rates for somebody who had an attack of acutemyocarditis is about fifty percent. But when I looked at your records, it seemslike you had something similar, although not as bad, happen in 2004,” he toldSean.“And you don’t have any reliable statistics on survival rates for somebody who’shad two episodes?”“Right.”“And if I have a third attack?”“Yeah, it’s a big problem.”The transplant cardiologist was focused on finding answers for Sean, suspectinghe had some sort of chronic immune problem that was making him susceptible tothese repeated cardiac events. He ran a Lyme test, and it showed five fullbands, meeting both New York State and CDC standards for a diagnosis of Lymedisease.The transplant cardiologist referred Sean to an immunologist with connections tothe National Institutes of Health. The cardiologist was interested in gettingSean tested for endogenous viral expression, innate and adaptive immunity, aswell as reverse transcriptase testing. Sean knew the immunologist had studied atColumbia University (presumably with Dr. Ian Lipkin), and this was where thingsstarted to go off the rails. For the sake of simplicity, let’s simply refer tothis immunologist as Dr. Bad-Medicine.Everything seemed to be going fine in the first part of this appointment untilDr. Bad-Medicine said he’d need to punch in some of these tests he wasrequesting into the National Institutes of Health database. Dr. Bad-Medicinesaid he’d be gone for just two minutes but didn’t return for about fifteen.Sean recalls Dr. Bad-Medicine having a little smile on his face when he returnedand looking down at the ground, before turning his attention to Sean. “Have youever heard of CFS, chronic fatigue syndrome?” he asked.“Yeah.”“I think you have CFS.”Sean replied, “Well, nobody has suggested that. And usually CFS patients havesymptoms, but not much in the way of abnormal test readings. I have multiplecardiopulmonary stress tests that show a major biological dysfunction to thepoint of exceeding long-term disability requirements. I have many blood testsfrom LabCorp and Quest that show very high immune response to multiple viruses.I have MRIs that show brain-stem inflammation consistent with significant viralactivity.”Dr. Bad-Medicine said, “You may have other health problems, but I think CFS isin the mix. Once CFS is in the mix, we don’t need to do any more tests becauseno tests make sense when someone has CFS. Unfortunately, nobody really knowsmuch about CFS.”Sean tried various approaches, such as noting his factor-eight levels for bloodclotting being low, or his TGF Beta 1 levels being so high they were consistentwith internal hemorrhaging.“No tests are relevant when somebody has CFS. If you have CFS, that’s all youhave.”Sean fell back on his math and engineering skills. This was preposterous.“You’re telling me that anything plus CFS simply equals CFS? Like an equation?”“Unfortunately, nobody really knows much about CFS,” said Dr. Bad-Medicine.“So, when did I get CFS? Was it after I was in the ICU for myocarditis? Or I hadit before, even though I was working seventy hours a week?”“It doesn’t matter when you got CFS. What matters is you have CFS now.”“That includes blood tests I got when I was eighteen?”“Once somebody has CFS, none of their past tests really matter.”Sean continued to argue with him. At one point, Dr. Bad-Medicine mentioned theremight be clinical trials at the NIH, or he might want to contact Dr. JoseMontoya at Stanford, but he wasn’t enthusiastic about any of the prospects.Sean protested. “I want to be able to enjoy my family, play with my kids, but Ican’t do that if I keep having these cardiac problems after a few minutes ofactivity.”“There are no treatments to improve your condition,” said Dr. Bad-Medicine.“Since there’s no way to get better, there’s no reason to do tests of any kind.You will not get the test you want here. You will not get the test you wantanywhere. There are no treatments available to help you here. There are notreatments available anywhere. You can see yourself out.”And with that, Dr. Bad-Medicine left the room.I cannot believe that man is allowed to be a healer.When I talk so passionately about the attack on me and the science, it’s becauseI know what Sean experienced is a direct result of the plague of corruption thatdestroyed my reputation. When you murder the truth, you murder the possibilityof an answer. We have had the answer for at least a decade! The retrovirusescontaminating the vaccines. In cardiovascular disease, the retrovirus Gary Owensdiscovered and discussed at the Cleveland Clinic meeting on November 10, 2009,XMRV-2! You see, Gary Owens’s expertise is cardiology. What did John Coffin andthe NIH do? They made certain Owens’s lab did not publish until 2013 and onlywith Coffin’s lab on the paper renaming the Virus BV2. Fraud and cover-up onceagain. There is nothing resembling truth in medicine in the developed worldtoday!We must not let this continue.image [../Images/common.jpg]The reason Frank Ruscetti went into scientific research rather than becoming amedical doctor was that he believed that discovering basic facts would helppromote human health long after this death. This is not as true in the case ofphysicians. He has always liked the idea of discovering something unknown. Ishare that passion. His love for scientific research has not changed, but heacknowledges that research has become more difficult because we have moreinformation. Scientists must bring a larger toolbox of techniques to solve theproblem.In order to fix what has gone wrong in science today, Frank has four specificrecommendations:1. Eliminate all financial prizes for scientists, as it hurts cooperation.2. Eliminate all anonymity for reviewers of grants and publications. If ascientist cannot say something publicly, then why is he saying it at all?3. Cap the amount of public grant money any individual researcher can receive.The more practicing scientists we have, the better it will be for science ingeneral.4. Establish a mandatory retirement age to unblock opportunities for the nextgeneration of scientists.2 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn11_2]I agree with Frank’s proposals to change how we are currently doing science andmedicine. I would add repeal of the Bayh-Dole Act, which allows federally fundedscientists to patent discoveries. I’ve always been offended by this act. How canI claim ownership of “intellectual property” when the taxpayers have paid for myeducation, supplies, equipment, and mentoring? When I entered the field beforeBayh-Dole, it seemed as if there were a more collaborative spirit amongresearchers. Science builds on the work of others. There was no “I” inscientific discovery, only “we.” I happily accepted lower pay for intellectualfreedom and the opportunity to advance human understanding.I’ve always believed scientists to be the best among us, in part because most,like me, didn’t go into it for the money. I always believed the mostintelligent, creative, and compassionate in research were also the humblest. Ido not believe the system is rewarding those qualities in our scientists today.We are turning those good people into outlaws.image [../Images/common.jpg]Okay, so that’s how Frank thinks we should fix science.Now, how do we help those who are currently suffering? We have a few ideas.If we’re under constant attack by viruses and retroviruses, not to mention theassault of chemicals that disrupt the proper functioning of our immune system(and don’t even get me started about the negative effects of electromagneticradiation from cell phones and cell towers), what are we to do if we want toregain our health?We’ve mentioned many times in this book how many scientific articles we’ve readin an attempt to understand what’s really going on with our health. And itstands to reason that anything we say here is the best plan I have as of 2019.Who knows what will happen in 2020 or the years beyond? However, we believe theprincipals we’re expressing are sound. We’re always ready to try something newif it seems promising and is safe. This is a work in progress, but we think atleast the outlines of it will hold up five, ten, or fifteen years from now.image [../Images/common.jpg]Among the first approaches we might try for any patient we suspect to besuffering from acquired immune dysfunction associated with retroviruses issomething called deuterium-depleted water. I am indebted to Dr. Petra Dorfsman,who introduced me to this information, as she has been a pioneer in its use inthe United States and supports my health with this amazingly simple solution.I never thought we’d start with something as simple as water. Everybody knowsthat the chemical formula for water is two hydrogens and an oxygen (H2O). Theclaim is that deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen (D2O), is clogging up ourmitochondria, lowering its output. Our cells then become loaded with deuterium.Petra really got our attention when she told us that deuterium acts as a growthand transforming factor in all microbes, including retroviruses and the cells inwhich these microbes live. Importantly, deuterium is a cancer-causingoncoisotype in any mammalian cell with mitochondria. Now, remember, we startedin science as cancer researchers, so when we investigated deuterium-depletedwater, we discovered our interest piqued when we found it was being used inmedical settings as an accompaniment to traditional chemotherapy.The main medical expert putting forth this theory is Dr. Laszlo Boros ofHungary, and this is from the abstract of a 2015 study that Dr. Boros conductedin combination with the University of California, Los Angeles, University ofArizona, and Johns Hopkins University:The naturally occurring isotope of hydrogen, deuterium, could have an importantbiological role. Deuterium depleted water delays tumor progression in mice,dogs, cats, and humans . . . A model is proposed that emphasizes the terminalcomplex of mitochondrial electron transport chain reducing molecular oxygen todeuterium depleted water (DDW); this affects glucogenesis as well as fatty acidoxidation . . . DDW is proposed her to link cancer prevention and treatmentusing natural ketogenic diets, low deuterium drinking water, as well as DDWproduction as the mitochondrial downstream mechanism of targeted anti-cancerdrugs such as Avastin and Glivec. The role of deuterium in biology is apotential missing link to the elusive cancer puzzle seemingly correlated withcancer epidemiology in western populations as a result of excessive deuteriumloading from processed carbohydrate intake in place of natural fat consumption.3[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn11_3]If there’s one thing that’s characterized my career, it’s being open to newideas and seeing how they may fit with what we already know, or think we know. Iwas taught by Frank to integrate new information so we might come to a betterunderstanding of the problem. I’d like to think this type of collaborativethinking in science is widespread, but it’s not. I can’t tell you how often I’veseen a new piece of information presented, real breakthroughs, then watched howa leading scientist who has even a moderately different approach won’t evenconsider it. In my opinion, there’s no place for ego in science.When Petra told me that deuterium acts as a growth factor for microbes includingretroviruses, it was like lightning in my brain. If we used that as a workingassumption, so many pieces of the puzzle would fall into place. Yes, the use ofanimal tissue for vaccines and other medical products was certainly a piece ofthe puzzle, but then when you add this deuterium-rich water that affects theworking of the mitochondria, a number of other interesting paths open up. Inumber myself one of those people who believes that cancer is always in us atsome level, but it’s the proper functioning of our immune system that keeps itat bay.What are some other lines of evidence to suggest deuterium-depleted water mightbe a useful weapon in our arsenal to promote health? We already know that theeating of too much processed food is linked to poor health. Petra and othersbelieve processed food is likely to contain high amounts of deuterium-heavywater. Sources of deuterium-depleted water are likely to be fresh food,especially healthy fats. That’s one of the reasons that many people withepilepsy have found success with the so-called ketogenic diet. The ketogenicdiet forces the body to take energy from healthy fats. These healthy fats arerich with deuterium-depleted water. That also may be why many find benefits fromfasting because it forces our body to burn our fat stores. This causes therelease of deuterium-depleted water from within our own fat cells, fuelinghealthy mitochondria.This likely explains the health benefits people get from healthy fats. They havethe right kind of water in them. And it turns on its head the whole campaign forlow-fat foods. We didn’t evolve by eating low-fat meals. We are puttingunnatural foods into our body in the belief that the type of things we’ve eatenfor millions of years are harming us. It’s madness. The other day I saw myhusband, David, about to pour some low-fat half and half into his coffee. Igrabbed it and tossed it down the drain, saying, “What do you think you’redoing?” The poor guy was so surprised. I said, “Look at the first ingredient:high fructose corn syrup. Honey-bear, please eat the full-fat foods. They tastebetter and they’re healthier for you.”I can also add a personal testimony to this story. Prior to my investigation ofXMRV, I was tested for exposure to HIV semiannually as I worked with it in thelab. In the XMRV investigation I was a negative control, as were other labworkers. Suddenly in 2011, Frank called me with the news that patient #2623 wastesting positive for XMRV with serology and protein assays. Patient #2623 is nota patient; it was me! I had done all my work under Bio-Safety Level 2+conditions. We wear double gloves, autoclave all trash, and bleach everything.If I had become infected with XMRV, there was only one possible way I hadcontracted it. The virus was aerosolized, meaning it could float through theair. Now, like Madame Curie, who studied radiation and eventually died fromradiation poisoning, I have become a victim of the monster I sought to study.Those with ME/CFS often complain of foggy thinking, multiple sclerosis-likeinability to walk or talk, and I have suffered such bouts as well, especiallyafter long plane flights, which have been shown to create oxidative stress. Yes,I now suffer many of the same problems of the patients I study. The answer tothe question of how to treat these conditions is no longer academic to me.It is personal.Petra suggested I try the deuterium-depleted water, and I said that soundedgreat. I’m always willing to try something new if it’s safe, and what could besafer than drinking water? For me, the results were remarkable. I was my oldself. I literally have the cognitive function I used to have before the lastdecade of working with the most transmissible of human disease-associatedretrovirus families, the XMRVs. If I were to look at my mitochondria, I imagineI’d see them generating the right amount of energy, rather than the dangersignals they would when they are under stress.I think there’s also another possible benefit to deuterium-depleted water, and Iwant to make sure I explain it correctly. If we have the water molecule with thecorrect isotope of hydrogen, the molecule will actually look different. Thiscorrect shape of water means it will be more easily able to penetrate the cellsand hydrate them. The mitochondria will then switch from sending out dangersignals to providing the energy needed by the cells to do their job of recoveryand repair. If the power plant of the body is running efficiently, all the otherorgans of the body can do their work knowing they have sufficient energy. Ifthere isn’t enough energy, the organs of the body, like the foreman of aproduction facility, must figure out shortcuts to keep things running. Maybesome parts of the plant will need to be shut down in the hope that not too muchdamage will take place until the power is restored. Deuterium-depleted water canbe found online at sites like Amazon.This may sound heretical if you’ve only studied the old-time theories of genesand how they work. But we’ve discovered there’s a literal symphony between ourenvironment and our genes.The official name of this branch of science is “Epigenetics.”Simply put, it means that your environment affects the functioning of yourgenes. DNA methylation is a primary epigenetic way to turn on and off genes. Butit is only one of many. If you’re living in a polluted environment, some geneswill switch on and others will switch off. The same has also been foundhappening when people are under high amounts of stress. Certain genes will turnon and others will turn off.It’s for these reasons, among others, that I fear what may come from geneticallymodified organisms (GMOs) in our food supply. We literally have no idea whatthese GMOs may do to our interior environment and which genes may inadvertentlybe turned on or off. I’m a big believer in science studying natural processes,then trying to follow that as much as possible.image [../Images/common.jpg]Even though I avoided recreational marijuana my entire life, I am now anenthusiastic backer of medical cannabis for chronic health conditions. Mycoauthor, Kent, laughs at how the two of us are such squares, as his first legaljob was working for the Drug Task Force of the United States Attorney’s Officein San Francisco, listening to wiretaps of Oakland drug lords. Now we are bothstrong backers of medical cannabis.I like to say we think cannabis has curative properties, meaning formulations ofcannabis can provide some assistance to those with chronic health conditions,but for the vast majority it will not be a “cure.” I compare what cannabis doesin the body to a dimmer switch on neuroinflammation. If your problem isrelatively mild, cannabis can certainly seem like a cure, but that’s because youdidn’t really have that far to go to restore immune endocannabinoid balance.It might be helpful for you to understand cannabis and what we call theendocannabinoid system. Although only discovered in 1987, I believe theendocannabinoid system is one of the most important systems in the body. Theendocannabinoid system has been called the “supercomputer that regulateshomeostasis in the body.” It consists of a group of molecules known ascannabinoids and the receptors to which they bind. We’ve learned that thesereceptors regulate a variety of functions, including appetite, pain,inflammation, thermoregulation, muscle control, metabolism, and even controlsour response to stress. Professor Raphael Mechoulam, widely acknowledged as thefather of cannabis medicine, has gone so far as to state that the“Endocannabinoid system is involved in essentially all disease states.”4[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn11_4] Cannabis has been found to have anticonvulsant,antipsychotic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antidepressant properties,among others.When our bodies are under stress, we can’t make our natural cannabinoids. Thisis certainly true of those with ME/CFS and children with autism, as well asthose with cancer. It might surprise you to discover that besides hemp andcannabis, the only other rich source of naturally occurring cannabinoids can befound in mother’s milk. Yes, that’s right, mother’s milk has cannabinoids. Howmany wonderful things can we say about what Mother Nature has provided us inmother’s milk?I believe that with the findings that cannabinoid receptors are present in thebrain and stem cells, we have an explanation for why cannabis has therapeuticbenefits for many chronic illnesses. Even small doses of plant-derivedcannabinoids can signal the body to make more of its own cannabinoids and canalso stimulate the building of more cannabinoid receptors. A functionalendocannabinoid system is essential for our health.Because of censorship and corruption in the science of cannabis, many of thestudies have been hidden or misrepresented to the public and medical community.Like any natural product made into a therapeutic, it needs the expertise andcommitment of scientists in order to translate unbiased science into usefultherapeutics.However, we think formulations of cannabis should be one of the first thingsthat a practitioner uses and can help in a wide variety of situations as alow-cost and remarkably safe intervention. Our job as translational scientistsis to quickly pursue these safe, supportive therapies free from political bias.This has not happened to date.For example, I’m sure you’ve heard about the water crisis in Flint, Michigan,where high levels of lead were allowed to be in the drinking water. When thatstory broke, I said, “Just throw the cannabis in the water. It’s a natural heavymetal detoxifying plant. Just don’t use it after that. Purify it.” I’m talkingabout an extract of the whole plant that has been purified. It’s a hugedetoxifier, and it would pull out all the heavy metals. There are very simple,cheap, and effective ways to pull these heavy metals out of people. Once we knowwhat the enemy is, we can devise strategies to fight it.The other benefit of cannabis is that the endocannabinoid system is alipid-signaling system that is critical to the function of hematopoietic stemcells and the mesenchymal stem cells, which means we’re talking about the properfunctioning of the brain, immune system, digestive system, and heart. Itprobably helps to think of your body as one gigantic signaling system. Themitochondria are at the heart of this signaling system because if you don’t havethe proper amount of energy, all the organs of the body must compensate byshutting down or running at reduced power and function. One of the things we’retrying to understand is what the biological markers of hibernating bears looklike. We expect many of them will resemble the markers of those with ME/CFS andother neuroimmune diseases.One of the truly horrifying things I’ve heard over the years related to energydepletion is how quickly children with autism who die go into rigor mortis.Think about what that really means. Their bodies are trying so desperately tostay alive that when they give up the ghost, rigor mortis sets in very quickly.I saw this same phenomenon with my aunt who died of pancreatic cancer in 2011.Chronic disease means your body is trying to stay alive. You are so close todeath that rigor mortis doesn’t take long. How horrifying.I was shocked at how quickly this happened in my aunt and didn’t reallyunderstand it until a researcher, Dr. Robert Naviaux of the University ofCalifornia, San Diego, explained it to me. “Chaos is entropy,” he said. “Nomovement.” We think of chaos as erratic movement, so it stunned me to think ofentropy as randomness or stillness. I thought not of the autism kids, but of theME/CFS patients who needed to lie in darkened rooms for most of the day and notmove. No light or sound. Any energy they expended came at the cost of terriblesuffering. What a horrible existence to be on the very edge of death, and youcan’t move in either direction. I believe there is a hell after this life, butthat certainly sounds like a living hell to me.There’s another way in which recent discoveries suggest we can healneurodegenerative diseases and brain tumors. I like to think of it as “brainwashing,” but I mean it in a good way.For decades, we’ve known of the body’s lymphatic system, which is essentially afluid superhighway, a protein-rich fluid that washes away the things your bodywants to get rid of, such as bacteria, cancer cells, dead cells, and toxins. Asimple way to explain the lymphatic system is to say it’s all the fluid in yourbody that isn’t blood. There is a network of connectors and pumps that containtrafficking molecules for immune cells, primarily macrophages (I like to imaginethem as little garbage trucks) that gobble up all the bad stuff and safelydispose of it.There’s been a widely held belief that the brain was “immune-privileged,”meaning antigens introduced could not elicit an immune response or createinflammation in the brain. Then in 2015, it was discovered that yes, the braindid have its own lymphatic system. Here’s how it was reported in the pages ofNeuroscience News:In a stunning discovery that overturns decades of textbook teaching, researchersat the University of Virginia School of Medicine have determined that the brainis directly connected to the immune system by vessels previously thought not toexist. That such vessels could have escaped detection when the lymphatic systemhas been so thoroughly mapped throughout the body is surprising on its own, butthe true significance of the discovery lies in the effects it could have on thestudy and treatment of neurological diseases ranging from autism to Alzheimer’sdisease to multiple sclerosis . . .The unexpected presence of the lymphatic vessels raises a tremendous number ofquestions that now need answers, both about the workings of the brain and thediseases that plague it.5 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn11_5]This is enormously important because while it’s been widely acknowledged thatvaccines can affect the workings of the immune system in a negative fashion, itwas believed they could not affect anything in the brain. The thought was thatthe brain was off-limits and protected. This discovery says simply that in factthe brain is connected to the immune system, so anything that causes a reactionin the immune system will also affect the workings of the brain.This is what you call a big “oops!” and a refutation of the idea that “scienceis settled” on anything.By quieting the inflammation in the nervous system, assisting in cellularsignaling, and restoring the balance of the endocannabinoid system, cannabis canplay a vital role in recovery for many individuals.image [../Images/common.jpg]In the previous section on cannabis, I mentioned the observations of Dr. RobertNaviaux, a researcher from the University of California, San Diego, whom Iconsider to be one of the best thinkers about autism and possible routes torecovery.Naviaux hypothesizes our modern world is triggering an ancient cellular defensesystem known as the “cell danger response.” He compares it to a castle in theMiddle Ages that was designed to be an impregnable fortress, used by the localsin times of emergency. When invaders came and could not be defeated by theKing’s forces, the villagers would run to the castle, the drawbridges would beraised, and the population could remain there in safety until the threat hadpassed. Naviaux believes our cells utilize a similar strategy when confronted bypathogens. However, what would happen if the threat remained persistent? Thevillagers would never come out of the castle. Normal commerce could not resume.While among humans there would be starvation, and likely cannibalism, in such ascenario, for the cell, it would need to go into a state of virtual hibernation.An article about Naviaux’s research from Science Daily on March 13, 2013,describes the main points of his theory:“When cells are exposed to classical forms of danger, such as a virus,infection, or a toxic environmental substance, a defense mechanism isactivated,” Naviaux explained. “This results in a change to metabolism and geneexpression and reduces the communication between neighboring cells. Simply put,when cells stop talking to each other, children stop talking.”6[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn11_6]That really covers a lot of ground doesn’t it? What we like about the Naviauxtheory is it frees us from the narrow question of what substance is causing theproblem to the broader question of how damage is being inflicted on the body. Weneed a clear marker so we can answer the questions of whether the body is in thecell danger response and what we might do in order to send the all-clear signalto the body.Not to get too geeky on you, but Naviaux identified seventeen inflammatorysignaling molecules that identify that one’s mitochondria is in the stressedstate of the cell danger response. They are called “mitokines,” and Naviauxmeasured them with a specially programmed mass spectrometer in his laboratory.He identified seventeen of these mitokines and had a clear target for hisintervention.Naviaux also identified a promising drug that was likely to quiet the celldanger response. It was called suramin and had been used safely for more than ahundred years to treat African Sleeping Sickness. I was familiar with suraminbecause I’d worked with it in the early cancer and AIDS drug trials, and forsome patients it produced fabulous results. At the time we couldn’t discern apattern, but I’ve since come to believe that the HIV-AIDS patients who died themost quickly were infected with both HIV and XMRV. Naviaux first induced thiscell danger in mice (using an injection that made the immune system of the micebelieve they had a viral infection), then tested them with suramin. As reportedin Science Daily:The drug restored 17 types of multi-system abnormalities including brain synapsestructure, cell to cell signaling, social behavior, motor coordination andnormalizing mitochondrial metabolism. “The striking effectiveness shown in thisstudy using APT [anti-purinergic therapy] to reprogram the cell danger responseand reduce inflammation showcases an opportunity to develop an entirely newclass of anti-inflammatory drugs to treat autism and several other disorders,”Naviaux said.7 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn11_7]Naviaux would add onto these initial mice studies mice who had a human ageequivalence of thirty years and mice with Fragile X Syndrome, often referred toas genetic autism. We think of autism as a disease of accelerated aging, so thegenetic diseases like Fragile-X and Rhett’s Syndrome molecular pathways may haverelevant similarities. (Rhett’s Syndrome is caused by a genetic defect in theDNA methyl-binding protein, MECP2.) The results were similarly successful in theother two trials, showing that even age or genetic status might not affect thesuccess of this drug intervention.Eventually, Naviaux was given permission to try this century-old AfricanSleeping Sickness drug on children with autism. In May 2015, the UCSD SuraminAutism Treatment Trial was started, and it was completed in March of 2016. Thestudy was a blind study, with five of the children receiving the drug and fivereceiving a placebo. In a clinical trial update from January 18, 2016, Naviauxwrote:Suramin produced improvements in all of the core symptoms of autism. All 5 ofthe 5 children we think received the treatment showed significant improvementsin language, social interaction, and expression of interest. Suramin appears tobe working at a fundamental level. By removing the developmental barriers causedby the cell danger response, suramin permitted children with autism to startmoving through developmental stages they had not completed before. Physiologicalabnormalities controlled by the brainstem and related to low parasympathetictone are well-known in autism. Many of these were corrected within hours of asingle dose of suramin.8 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn11_8]This is the parental report from subject number one of the UCSD Suramin trial. Iwant you to imagine how you would react if this were your child. The parents ofthis child are both physicians, so one would generally trust their observations:Can you imagine being the parent of one of the locked-in patients in the movie“Awakenings”? Our son is 11 years old. At one-and-a-half years old, he knew hiscolors, shapes and numbers in English, Spanish and Farsi. He could put puzzlestogether faster than anyone at his age. He was social and engaged others. Bythree years old all of that language and communication was lost, and he wasdiagnosed with autism.The first night, after eating all his dinner, he calmly looked up at me andsaid, “I finished my dinner.” He had never said this before. Usually he wouldsay, “I did it,” when he finished his dinner. Two days after the infusion, athis follow-up visit to the infusion center, he said clearly to the nurse, “Iwant to go to the bathroom again.” This was probably the longest sentence of hislife. Six days after the infusion, he started asking to try new and differentfoods. He ate lettuce! This was a big change because he is usually a very pickyeater.We have been working hard, trying every new treatment for autism that seemedreasonable for the past eight years. Nothing has come close to the effects wesaw from suramin. Just one dose of suramin gave us a glimpse of that child whowas locked in by his disease.So, can you imagine being the parent of that locked-in patient in the movie“Awakenings”? When the patients finally wake up and smile and dance. But thenit’s all taken away?9 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn11_9]Knowing what we do about the suffering endured by children with autism and theirparents, it’s difficult for me to read that account and not ask why the federalgovernment isn’t moving forward with all possible speed to get this drugapproved for use in autism.How difficult can it be?Suramin has already been in use for more than a century and is on the WorldHealth Organization’s (WHO) list of essential medicines. These are medicinesconsidered to be most effective and safe to meet the important needs in a healthsystem. The only reason there was a problem was that in the 1980s the cancercowboys gave such high doses to HIV-AIDS and cancer patients that there waskidney damage. The amount we’re talking about giving to these children is lessthan 5 percent of the dose that was given safely for more than seventy-fiveyears.Perhaps the real problem is suramin is off-patent, which means the company thatowns it, Bayer, needs to create a slightly different molecule so that they’ll beable to market it and make billions.Early on in his work, Naviaux was happy to consult with me, but when he foundout what had happened to me, he severed all communications. After all, suraminworked best on gamma-retroviruses and the methylation and mitochondrial defectsassociated with those most susceptible to injury. Still, I’m not sure that whenI meet God, I want to tell Him I was safe while people were suffering. If othersare suffering, I do not want God to ask me why I valued my own reputation overthe needs of others.The statement below is from an article Naviaux published in 2018. I wish thatall scientists could pursue their work without fear of persecution. But I fearthat is not the case when one comes up against powerful interests.Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is an energyconservation program—a suite of metabolic and gene expression changes— thatpermits persistence under harsh environmental conditions at the expense ofreduced functional capacity, chronic suffering and disability . . . However,several energy conservation states are known that are activated by harshenvironmental conditions. One of these is called dauer, the German word forpersistence, or to endure. When dauer is triggered by harsh conditions, the lifeexpectancy of a classical genetic model system, the 1 mm long wormCaenorhabditis elegans, is extended from 2 to 3 weeks to up to 4 months . . .The good news is that the dauer state in the worm model is completelyreversible. If dauer is a good model for ME/CFS, then there is hope that bystudying the molecular controls of the dauer phenotype, new treatments might bediscovered rationally to help stimulate the exit from the dauer-like state andbegin the process of recovery.10 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn11_10]Do you appreciate why we want to study hibernating bears and their physiology?They’re certainly a lot closer to humans than a worm. It seems that what we’remissing is a key piece of the puzzle, and perhaps suramin, a sponge that soaksup danger signals, is some way to signal to the body that things are fine. Thedrawbridge can be lowered, and recovery can begin.If we can get the mitochondria working at its proper level withdeuterium-depleted water, tamp down inflammation with cannabis, and then sendthe all-clear signal with a compound like suramin, we might be setting the stageto heal even our most challenging chronic diseases.image [../Images/common.jpg]In 1998, Dr. Andrew Wakefield and twelve colleagues published a case seriesreport in The Lancet describing mild to moderate inflammation of the largeintestine, as well as swelling of the lymph glands in the intestinal lining ofthe small intestine in twelve children with autism spectrum disorder. Nine ofthe parents noted the appearance of BOTH the gastrointestinal problems andautistic behaviors in conjunction with a measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) shot. Thisis the first known scientific description of what would later come to be calledthe “gut-brain” connection in autism. Whatever you may think of AndrewWakefield, it is one of the most important contributions to autism research.From my background in HIV-AIDS research, it made perfect sense. Retroviruseslove to hang out in the digestive tract. A great deal of the immune system isfound in the digestive tract. So, if you’re a retrovirus and you want to disablethe immune system, the gut is where you want to go. Not hard to make thatconnection, right? That’s not rocket science. It’s just common sense.If these retroviruses are affecting the immune system of the gut (and byextension the brain), you’d also expect to find abnormal bacterial populations,as well. This has become a fascinating area of scientific research, and thesebacterial populations in the digestive system have become popularly known as the“microbiome.”Probably one of the best thinkers in this area today is Dr. James Adams ofArizona State University. He’d been intrigued by reports that when children withautism and gut problems were treated with an antibiotic, vancomycin, both theirautism and gut problems improved, sometimes dramatically. However, whentreatment was discontinued, the children relapsed. Adams theorized that thechildren had an abnormal microbiome, and these bacterial populations were notcreating the chemicals necessary for the proper functioning of the body andmind. It might make sense to treat first with vancomycin, then provide materialfrom a person with a healthy microbiome. This material would come from purifiedhuman feces. Feces are about 50 percent bacteria. A 2019 article fromSmithsonian highlighted this area of research, as well as the work of Dr. Adams:More than a decade ago, a theory began to emerge of a gut-brain connection,where a dysfunction in the gut could also affect brain activity. “Seventypercent of our nerves that go into the central nervous system go into our gut.Why is that?” asks Sarkis Mazmanian, a medical researcher at the CaliforniaInstitute of Technology. Mazmanian noted that in germ-free mice, with nobacteria in the gut, “things like anxiety, locomotion, depression and even braindevelopment seemed to be altered” compared with normal animals.Mazmanian and a team of researchers demonstrated this gut-brain connection in amouse model of autism in 2013. Three years later, the team did the same forParkinson’s disease. And recently they showed that transplanting feces from aperson with autism into germ-free mice would produce many symptoms of ASD in theanimals. 11 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn11_11]Adams and Mazmanian have Wakefield to thank for that “gut-brain” connection inautism. Mazmanian, though, seems to have done a good job in furthering theresearch. They and others have found significantly reduced gut varieties of gutbacteria in ASD, ME/CFS among other chronic neuroimmune diseases. Although thegerm-free mice are not an exact fit for humans, it’s interesting to note thatthose who don’t have any bacteria in their gut have problems with anxiety,locomotion, depression, and altered brain development. The implications of thesefindings are enormous.Could anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues be linked to the gutmicrobiome? Transplanting bacteria from a person with autism into a germ-freemouse makes that mouse display many of the behaviors of autism. This is aremarkable proof of concept. And it hints we’re just seeing the tip of theiceberg of a potential scientific revolution. Could we also put Parkinson’sdisease into the category of affliction, which is influenced, if not caused, byabnormal gut bacteria?All of this got Dr. Adams thinking about whether first clearing out the gut withan antibiotic, then attempting to recolonize the gut with bacteria from ahealthy donor, might change the clinical picture of autism. Adams prepared asmall clinical trial. A later passage from the Smithsonian article read:The study enrolled 18 children, ages 7 to 18, with a diagnosis of ASD andsignificant GI [gastro-intestinal] problems. The regimen was exacting butrelatively kid friendly.They used antibiotics to kill specific classes of bacteria in the gut to mimicthe losses in ASD and ME/CFS. The results of the study were exactly as predictedby earlier studies and Dr. Andrew Wakefield.16 kids had at least a 70 percent improvement in their GI symptoms, andimportantly, they showed improvements in their behavioral symptoms of autism.That paper was published in January 2017 and so impressed the Pentagon that theDepartment of Defense agreed to fund a large study of microbial transplants inadults with autism, which began enrolling patients in early 2018.12[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn11_12]Further on in the article, they note that two years after treatment, thesymptoms had decreased in severity by 47 percent. And while at the beginning 83percent of the patients were rated as being on the severe end of the autismspectrum, after two years that number dropped to 17 percent with 44 percenthaving improved so much that they no longer qualified as having autism.Regardless of your opinion of the cause of autism and many of the other chronicmental and neurological problems in our country, this is hopeful news.There are caveats, to be certain, such as making sure that no harmful bacteriaare cultured in the mixture provided to the patients. I also think it’snecessary to make sure that a patient’s “leaky gut” is fixed, meaning there’s noperforations in the intestinal lining, like what Wakefield first found. “Leakygut” is now alleged to occur in many different conditions, which is anotherreason why I think that even if we’re talking about autism or ME/CFS, thelessons are probably applicable to many different diseases.However, there’s one thing that concerns me even more. It’s the last sentence Iquote where it says the paper “so impressed the Pentagon that the Department ofDefense agreed to fund a large study of microbial transplants in adults withautism . . .”The Pentagon?The Department of Defense?Why are military organizations taking the lead on this issue? Aren’t theyinvolved in building planes, ships, submarines, tanks, bombs, and missiles?Shouldn’t it be the National Institutes of Health? The Centers for DiseaseControl? Last time I checked, the Pentagon was in charge of killing bad guys,not healing the sick.Or is there another agenda at work here? Military families must submit tovaccinations, and many have claimed the children of service members have ratesof autism and other neurological conditions that are much higher than those ofthe general public. Perhaps our military is trying to fix the daily battle somany of their families face in their homes, so their members will be able tofight the battles we wage in distant lands.image [../Images/common.jpg]Over the weekend of March 22 and 23, 2019, I spoke at a conference in Florida.It was put on by a remarkable young scientist, Dr. Kristin Comella, who remindedme a great deal of myself when I was her age. She has a strong sense of serviceand has worked herself to the cutting edge of stem cell science. And of course,she’d been attacked by the government with lawsuits and threats to destroy hercareer but has so far fought them off. What’s her crime? According to the FDA,taking your own fats cells out of your body through liposuction and removing thestem cells and reinjecting them into another body part constitutes theadministration of a drug.Dr. Comella is the chief scientific officer of U.S. Stem Cell and the presidentof the Academy of Regenerative Practices. The conference was the annual meetingof the Academy of Regenerative Practices, and it was a great opportunity to talkwith leading figures in the field and compare notes. This is where I always loveto be, on the very frontiers of knowledge.I was joined by other renegades at the conference, including Dr. AndrewWakefield. He gave a great talk about measles and how the effort to eradicate itwas simply driving the creation of new strains and leaving death in its wake. Wegot the opportunity to sit down and have a long conversation, something wehadn’t ever really had, even though we’ve known each other for a decade. I wasable to share with him how Dr. Ian Lipkin of Columbia University had used someof the same scientific sleight of hand to discredit our work with XMRV, asLipkin had done with his work with the MMR shot and the accompanyinggastrointestinal disorders and autism. I told him I couldn’t watch thedocumentary featuring him, The Pathological Optimist, because I knew in advancethe legal system would be manipulated on the jurisdictional question so hewouldn’t be able to have a single day in court to try and clear his name. Thesame tricks had been played on me in Nevada. I don’t think he’d been aware ofhow similar our two cases were, and when we parted, he told me he wanted tointerview me for his next documentary.I often joke about how nonpolitical I am, so when there was a section of theconference on censorship and they said Roger Stone was speaking, I asked myfriend Lori quietly, “Who’s Roger Stone?” Lori gave me Roger’s backstory.Chairman of Donald Trump’s first political campaign, longtime advisor to Trump,political provocateur, cohost of a show called The War Room on Infowars, and theman most responsible for President George W. Bush winning that fight in Floridaagainst Al Gore. Lori told me how Stone had recently attracted the attention ofSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian collusion, whenStone’s aggressive reporting made Mueller believe Stone was an actual Russianagent. This sixty-seven-year-old political provocateur who is also well knownfor his annual Best-Dressed list, found his home raided by the FBI.When Lori filled me in on the story of Roger Stone, I wasn’t sure I wanted tolisten to his talk. “Oh, that sounds familiar,” I remarked. Yes, I’d also beentreated like a fugitive drug lord or potential terrorist. I’d been fifty-threeyears old when my home was raided, and although I didn’t have a CNN camera crewrecording my arrest, the powerful forces made sure my mug shot was printed inthe journal Science as a warning to any researcher who dared associateretroviruses with ME/CFS. “I think this talk might give me PTSD all over again.”I listened to his talk anyway. The stress of what Roger had been going throughshowed during his presentation and he said he was also fighting a cold. At theend of his presentation, he said he’d take some questions, so I stood and waitedto be called on.“I wanted to ask a question about vaccines and our religious freedoms. When isTrump going to stop them from censoring our science that shows how the health ofour country is being destroyed? When is somebody going to start talking aboutthat?” I was unable to control my emotions, and my voice was shaking.“That’s a great question. It’s a second-term priority,” Stone replied.After the talk, Lori introduced me to Roger, and she briefly explained what I’dbeen through. “Hang in there,” he said. “We’ll get there.”image [../Images/common.jpg]I am now among the villains according to the media. But like Andy Wakefield saidwhen asked how he has survived to move forward and do great works, it’s allabout “The simple realization that it’s not about me.”The only people who really understand what I’ve been through are the doctor(Wakefield) who supposedly wants children to die and the political provocateur(Stone) who’s allegedly a Russian agent. Though my husband, David, or FrankRuscetti might not fully understand the depth of the corruption of our scienceand medicine, they know me.I’m blessed to have the opportunity to work alongside Robert Kennedy, Jr. andhis Children’s Health Defense organization, which is winning remarkablevictories against corruption in medicine. Kennedy recently got an admission fromthe federal government that despite the requirements of the 1986 NationalChildhood Vaccine Injury Act that a report must be provided to Congress everytwo years certifying that the vaccine schedule is safe, no such studies haveEVER been done.13 [../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn11_13]Think about that.Your public health agencies have failed to do their job for the past thirty-sixyears showing the safety of the childhood vaccine schedule. There should befifteen reports available to every American parent, and Health and HumanServices should be almost completed with number sixteen.There are zero reports testifying as to the safety of the childhood vaccineschedule, or a single vaccine on that schedule. And yet, a WHO essentialmedication that showed remarkable benefit in a double-blind placebo-controlledstudy (Suramin) is kept from suffering children!Who are the real villains?When I’m in despair, I turn to a section of Robert Kennedy Jr.’s fine bookAmerican Values in which he recounts his father’s love of the Stoic philosophy.Kennedy, Jr. writes:That philosophy argued that, in an absurd world, the acceptance of pain,accompanied by the commitment to struggle, transforms the most common men intoheroes and provides the most tragic hero peace and contentment. The hero,Sisyphus, condemned by the gods to roll a rock uphill for eternity, only to seeit tumble back down, was ultimately a happy man. Even recognizing and acceptingthe futility of his task, he could find nobility in the struggle. It is neitherour position nor our circumstances that define us, according to the Stoics, butour response to those circumstances; when destiny crushes us, small heroicgestures of courage and service can bring us peace and fulfillment. In applyingour shoulder to the stone, we give order to a chaotic universe.14[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn11_14]I can’t tell you I’ll submit to this absurd world cheerfully. I will rageagainst the corruption with all my strength. But I will channel that rage intomoving forward and continue to put my shoulder to the stone.Now that you know my story, perhaps you will be part of the solution. Put yourshoulder to the stone with me."},{"pageContent":"images [../Images/line.jpg]CHAPTER TWELVEOne More Story I Should Probably Tellimages [../Images/line.jpg]Where does all of this leave us?The plague of corruption is enormous and encompasses many areas of ourscientific, medical, and daily political existence.The pharmaceutical companies have corrupted the laws regarding vaccinations, anda corrupt media has poisoned the mind of the public. The public does not ask thesimple question: if vaccines are as safe as sugar water, why do thepharmaceutical companies need to have complete financial immunity and beprotected by a battalion of lawyers from the US Department of Justice?The pharmaceutical companies are the largest contributors to the US Congress andhave more lobbyists than all our congressmen and senators combined. That meansthey control the federal agencies, which is exactly what our constitution withits series of checks and balances was designed to prevent.The pharmaceutical companies are also bribing the media by their massiveadvertising buys on the evening news. Don’t believe me? Watch an hour of yourfavorite news station and count the number of pharmaceutical ads. Chances arethat 50–60 percent of the ads will be for pharmaceutical companies. Ourcolleagues are particularly outraged by the commercial of the grandmotherturning into a big, bad wolf if she does not get a whooping cough vaccine.We understand how people can get discouraged when they see such a gauntlet oflegal, financial, and political firepower arrayed against us.But they underestimate those of us who do the hard work of understandingbiological processes. We plan for many different contingencies. You see, we’reused to dealing with the unknown. We simply hadn’t planned on the dark side ofhuman nature that they have shown us as we have tried to answer the mostpressing questions of human health.image [../Images/common.jpg]Since June 6, 1983, when I started working for Frank, I realized he embodied thevery best of science and character. He always wanted to see all the data all thetime. Massaging the data with statistics was absolutely unacceptable at weeklylab meetings where everyone was free to offer opinions. That was something hedrilled into my head, and I’ve never forgotten it. It’s why, even after I gotmarried to David in 2000 and relocated to the West Coast, we continued todiscuss our data or recent publications, usually having a long phone call at 5a.m. Pacific time and 8 a.m. Eastern time.Frank became an inside player in science in the 1970s, at a time when thecorruption was less blatant and it was possible to go through a career withoutseeing the darkness. And if you don’t see the darkness, it’s difficult tobelieve it exists.Bernie Poiesz, the MD who isolated the first human retrovirus, HTLV-1, whileworking as a clinical fellow for Frank, has described Frank as one of the lasttrue Renaissance men, a cross between Leonardo Da Vinci and Rocky Marciano,because he is so widely read and never pulls punches.1[../Text/20_Notes.xhtml#fn12_1] How were Bernie and Frank able to isolate thatfirst human retrovirus, when the Japanese had been working on the problem foryears? Because Frank taught Bernie what he knew about growing viruses in cellcultures and following reverse transcriptase activity. Yes, Robert Gallo endedup getting the Lasker Award (often referred to as the American Nobel Prize forscientific research) for the discovery of HTLV-1. But it was Bernie and Frankwho did the work. Perhaps Gallo would have won the Nobel Prize for HIV if he haddone the same a few years later?The credit has gone rightfully to Luc Montagnier, the French researcher whoisolated the HIV virus. But Montagnier might never have won his Nobel Prize in2007 if he had not been wise and learned the lessons of HTLV-1 isolation. UnlikeGallo, who likes to hog all the credit, Montagnier has generously given creditto Frank on multiple occasions for his contributions in HIV-AIDS research.We would never have been able to isolate XMRVs if it hadn’t been for what Frankhad taught me. In retrospect, I realize that Frank and I existed in our ownlittle bubble in that Bio-Safety Level 3 lab at the National Cancer Institute,thinking about and publishing all the data, even the data we did not understand.Frank has been at the forefront of discovery of human disease-associatedretroviruses and the function of the immune system because of his vision and hiswork ethic. One would have thought this would have given him some protection.But it didn’t.image [../Images/common.jpg]I believe the campaign against Frank Ruscetti kicked into high gear after theFirst International Symposium on XMRV, when the response to the criticalquestion of Francis Collins of where we got the control group results of 4percent from the United Kingdom was from blood bank samples in that country.It was after that meeting that Collins tasked Fauci to fund and conduct a“confirmation study” of our work. Apparently, the study by Shyh-Ching Lo andHarvey Alter, a Lasker Award-winning scientist, wasn’t enough of a confirmationto satisfy them!Maybe it was a coincidence, but prior to 2010, the National Cancer Institute wasrun by a fine doctor named John Niederhuber, who was supportive of the work withXMRV and prostate cancer. But what happened in 2010, just as the XMRV freighttrain was gathering momentum?They brought in Harold Varmus to take over from John Niederhuber.Just so you know how absurd this was, you should know that Harold Varmus wasdirector of the National Institutes of Health from 1993 to 1999 in the BillClinton administration. The National Cancer Institute is a division of theNational Institutes of Health. After leaving as director of the NationalInstitutes of Health, Varmus went to work as the president of the Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center in New York City, where he served for ten years.Let’s talk about downward mobility and see if this makes any sense.Depending on experience (and probably your political backing), the director ofthe National Institutes of Health will make somewhere up to $230,000 a year.In 2016, it was reported that the president and CEO of the Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center, Dr. Craig Thompson, made $2,944,000, or about ten timeswhat one would make as director of the National Institutes of Health.Now, the latest information on a salary for the director of the National CancerInstitute (a division of the National Institutes of Health) is up to a littlemore than a $151,000.Okay, so let’s get this chain of events straight.You’re Harold Varmus and you’ve got both a Nobel Prize and a Lasker Award.You serve as the director of the National Institutes of Health for eight years.After serving as director of the National Institutes of Health, you pick up asweet gig at a New York cancer clinic where you make a couple million dollars ayear.Then suddenly you decide you want to head up a division of the NationalInstitutes of Health (National Cancer Institute), where at most you’ll make alittle over a hundred and fifty thousand a year, about five percent of whatyou’d made the previous year.I just don’t buy it.Harold Varmus was brought on to get Frank Ruscetti under control.image [../Images/common.jpg]When Harold Varmus took over at the National Cancer Institute, he directed ateam led by John Coffin to discredit Frank Ruscetti.This was May of 2010, and there was a great deal happening with XMRV. We knewthat the Shyh-Ching Lo and Harvey Alter confirmation study was in press in thejournal of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). Thatsecond confirmatory study should have made us bulletproof. The guardians ofpublic health must surely have been on high alert, wondering how they couldderail XMRV.Coffin would go on to have meetings with Frank, usually attended by Steve Hughesand Doug Lowie, a Lasker Award winner for developing the Gardasil vaccine, whichis now destroying the lives of so many young girls and boys, often making themsterile. It paralyzes some of them and kills others.At one particularly contentious meeting, Hughes said to Frank, “This isn’t aninquisition,” when Frank grumbled why they were asking so many questions abouthow he was getting all the positives for XMRV and other researchers, as well.“Sure looks like one,” Frank said back to them.Frank didn’t say much to me about those monthly meetings, although he oftencompared them to being waterboarded in order to get Frank to renounce the rawdata. In October of 2010, as the evidence of a heavily contaminated blood supplybegan to mount, Frank recounted Coffin angrily stating, “Science started this,and Science is going to end this!”image [../Images/common.jpg]After I gave that talk in Ottawa on September 22, 2011, I was burned at thestake as predicted by Coffin. We had integrated our seminal discoveries fromHIV-AIDS as well as DNA methylation to show how this new family of retroviruseswas devastating humanity. They said it was fraud. Really? Science reviewers andeditors reviewed all the data and had them peer-reviewed prior to publication.The journal cut two-thirds of the paper prior to publication, where we detailedthe culturing of cells with the DNA methylation inhibitor. Because we refused tobe intimidated, they planned to steal all the raw data when I was fired onSeptember 29, 2011, then force the retraction of our paper. The journal Scienceknowingly published fraud September 22, that Michael Busch and Simone Glynn-led“Failure to Confirm” study instead of the true study that the blood supply wascontaminated. After I was released from jail in 2011, Frank’s punishment was toallow a full investigation of all the data of the XMRV studies, including thatfigure produced in Frank’s lab at the National Cancer Institute.Of course, Frank’s lab passed with flying colors and yet the retraction wasforced anyway, and the wording of that retraction essentially states that thefigure was fraud. It was not!Frank and his wife, Sandy, were both forced to retire in 2013, regardless of thefacts, just as they had put the XMRV genie back in its bottle and claimed it wasall contamination. For good measure, they forced Frank to coauthor anotherpurely fraudulent paper, which blamed all the contamination on my lab in the WPIinstead of the NCI lab’s in building 535. John Coffin kept his promise. Scienceended our careers and the hopes of millions who are suffering from a range ofterrible chronic diseases. But don’t worry about John Coffin. Coffin was awardeda patent in the summer of 2011 for detection of XMRV contaminants in the bloodsupply and biological materials.They’d just about wrapped up everything, and now all that was left to do was getrid of the evidence. My lab in Nevada had been locked down, my notebooks taken,and all the raw data taken. Lipkin had performed the requested “debunking”study, and Silverman at the Cleveland Clinic and Whittemore and the Nevadainstitutions continue to be awarded millions of dollars of funding. It’s nodifferent from the medical staff who got paid off from that first outbreak atthe Los Angeles County General Hospital in 1934–1935.Just continue the cover-up and carry on.image [../Images/common.jpg]But what no one at the National Cancer Institute ever realized was that Frankspent his last two years in Frederick, MD, doing critical work. Frank went backto our original samples and reisolated XMRV, obtaining a full sequence. He savedthe liquid nitrogen samples of our original stocks of B cell lines and patientsamples, which had never touched Building 535, where they’d contaminated afermenter of our natural isolate of XMRV by placing it next to a fermenter withVP62.There could be no question of contamination with the original samples saved byFrank.And when the order came for Frank to clean out his lab, he was told he couldtake all of his work and materials, except for any records and biologicalsamples regarding XMRV. All samples he was ordered to autoclave and the data tobe destroyed Thompson/CDC style. They even sent a security guard to make surethat Frank complied.Frank threw all the data into a blue recycling bin and packaged up thebiological samples and sent them to a biostorage facility in the Midwest, wherewe’ve been paying five hundred dollars a month to store them since. To havedestroyed the samples or data would have been in violation of federal law.Frank and Sandy had long planned to retire in Carlsbad, California, andpurchased a home there around fifteen years ago, which they often generouslyoffered as a vacation getaway to cancer patients in my support groups. One day,a few weeks after they moved in, Frank showed up at my door carrying the largeblue recycling bin.“I don’t know how this shit got in my moving van,” he said, pointing to it.“Thank you,” I whispered, tears welling in my eyes.I looked through the data. They were all there. They may have taken my notebooksand those of my research team, but collaborators are bound to maintain recordsof ALL of their data. The inquisition had confirmed Frank’s lab had maintainedaccurate records of all data.I scanned every piece of those data into hard drives, and for good measure weeven met with the FBI in the office of my faithful attorney, David Follin, andgave them a copy of the hard drive. If we ever get some honest people at the topof the FBI, maybe we can finally prove the corruption and end this reign ofdarkness. I know it doesn’t bring back those who have already lost their livesto this plague or make up for the suffering of millions today. We have done allwe could.Now, as always, it is up to God. I may be a scientist, but I’ve always believedin something beyond this world. At some point, we must lay our troubles down andlet God be God, working things out in His own mysterious ways. He will put theright people on these challenges, perhaps those with more wisdom and discernmentthan we who have gone before, and they will lead us to a better world.Blessings and good health to you all."},{"pageContent":"Notesimages [../Images/line.jpg]Introduction1 [../Text/07_Introduction.xhtml#rfn101_1] Byron Marshall Hyde, MD, et al., TheClinical and Scientific Basis of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic FatigueSyndrome (Ottawa, Canada: The Nightingale Research Foundation, 1992), 125.2 [../Text/07_Introduction.xhtml#rfn101_2] John R.
