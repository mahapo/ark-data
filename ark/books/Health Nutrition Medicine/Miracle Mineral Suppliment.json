Humble 2nd Edition"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"What this Book is About I hope you do not think that this book tells about just another very interesting supplement that can help some people af ter taking it for several months. Not so. This Miracle Mineral supp lement works in a few hours. The #1 killer of mankind in the world to day is malaria, a disease that is usually overcome by this supplement in only four hours in most cases. This has been proven through clinical trials in Malawi, a country in eastern Africa. In killing th e malaria parasite in the body, there was not a single failure. More than 75,000 malaria victims have taken the Miracle Mineral Supplement a nd are now back to work and living productive lives. After taking the Miracle Mineral Supplement AIDS pa tients are often disease free in three days and other diseases and c onditions simply disappear. If patients in the nearest hospital wer e treated with this Miracle supplement, over 50% of them would be back home within a week. For more than 100 years clinics and hospitals have used the active ingredients in this supplement to sterilize hospita l floors, tables, equipment, and other items. Now this same powerful germ-killer can be harnessed by the immune system to safely kill pa thogens in the human body. Amazing as it might seem, when used correctly, the immune system can use this killer to only attack those germs, bac teria and viruses that are harmful to the body, and does not affect the fr iendly bacteria in the body nor any of the healthy cells. In this boo k I have, to the best of my ability, stuck to the facts of exactly what h as happened regarding the Miracle Mineral Supplement. This book is the story of the discovery and further development of the most amazing enhancement for the immune system yet discovered. Thus it is the greatest solution to man kind = s diseases and ills now known; it is not a drug. I believe if you follow my efforts to develop this data and to make it available to the p ublic, the story will help make it real to you and convince you to give i t a try. To that"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"purpose I have provided complete details on how to make the supplement in your kitchen, or to buy most of the i ngredients off the shelf. It is entirely possible that you will save someone = s life, or your own. Because the Miracle Mineral Supplement functions as a supercharger to the immune system, it is not meant for treatment of any particular disease, but rather it is meant to improve the immu ne system to the point of overcoming many diseases, frequently in le ss than 24 hours. My purpose for writing this book is that this infor mation is far too important to allow any one person or one group or e ven several groups to have control. It is information that the world should have. After 5 years of seeing practically nothing done by a group that could have done a great deal, I finally realized that the information simply had to be distributed to as many people as possible or someone would always be out of the loop of receiving this l ife saving data. It regularly occurs that there is a great deal of impo rtant medical information withheld from the public that could sav e lives. It is my intention to prevent that from happening with this information."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Forward This Forward is written by Dr. Hector Francisco Rem ero G. who is a Medical doctor in the state of Sonora, Mexico where he has a very successful clinic that treats cancer and many other what are considered i ncurable diseases. He uses the MMS talked about in this book and a number of other non intrusive treatments. He is well know in Sonora for the work that he has done with the Mexican Indians. Dr. Romero makes me look much greater than I am, bu t then how could I refuse his Forward. Dr. Romero writes: A dear good old friend of mine and respectful phil osopher teacher impeller of man of good temper in this dese rt state of Sonora Mexico used to say: “Those men who live “the University of Life ,” would leave footprints in this world.” Not just anyone builds up and writes with his own i deas “a book.” This is the same case with my friend Jim Humble. A Challenger, a worl d walker, an anxious person, who has fought all his life to leave footprints wit h his contributions of investigation to man humanity. He has covered miles and miles of kilometers as his investigation has shown in this book, suffering infectious illnes s of Malaria; an illness which put his life at risk, demonstrating to medical science that it is possible to count with new alternatives treatments. It will give a better qual ity of life to those sick ones from endemics zones, as Jim says, in latitudes like in t he region of Africa, Asia, and South Africa. In these places there is a lot of mor tality due to malaria and other virus infections such as the HIV, causing the death statistics to be very considerable and is higher compared to other places in the world . His product was investigated and well recognized by the health authorities in an African country. With the MMS, he offers them bette r hopes and quality of life. Especially, those who have the threats of these man destructive illnesses. Our experience in Mexico with the MMS, in the state of Sonora has been to treat some illnesses that are contagious febrile infections, i nflammatory degenerative tumors, prostate cancer, and some other malignant tumors, w ith good and hopefully results. For all of these I pray to god so he can have a gre at intelligence so he continues helping those towns of the world that have no hope and are forgotten, specially the children that deserve our attention for a life, and a better future.

It was a long narrow house and there was furniture to get around and a hallway to get through, but in sp ite of the obstacle course I made it. Bill Denicolo, an old friend, i n Chicago was calling. We talked and he asked, A Jim, are you any good at prospecting for gold? @ I was never too modest, so I told him the truth (my truth). A Yes, @ I said, A I am amongst the best, if not the best. @ That was enough for him. He was a friend, and being already familiar with my work i n mining, he believed me. He continued, A I = m working with a group that wants to do gold mining in the jungle in South America. We need your help and we are paying the going rate, plus you get a share of the profits. @ That was it. I agreed to leave in approximately one month. The y were willing to use my gold recovery technology. This would r equire that I ship equipment ahead. It took the entire month to get th ings ready and to ready myself for the jungle. The most important t hing that I took, that relates to this story, was several bottles o f Stabilized Oxygen (Please don = t get the idea that Stabilized Oxygen is the miracle solution that I am writing about in this book.) All wa ter in the jungle is dangerous to drink. In North America, water from fa st- moving streams is usually quite safe to drink, but in the jung le it doesn’t matter how fast the stream is moving, it is not safe to drink. In fact, one can almost always guarantee that one or more dang erous diseases are present. Despite that knowledge, I did end up dr inking from a fast-moving stream while in the jungle, and I did devel op typhoid fever. See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The Discovery  Chapter 1  Page 2 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century A number of people had mentioned to me that the oxygen in Stabilized Oxygen would purify water by killing the pathoge ns present, especially if the water was left setting overnight . I had once sent a single test off to a laboratory after treating some sew erage water with Stabilized Oxygen and the results had come back sh owing all pathogens dead. I was relatively confident that I could p urify my drinking water in the jungle. I had actually worked with Stabilized Oxygen for some time. A friend of mine that lived a little way outside of Las Vegas used it qui te a bit with his animals. He gave it to his chickens in their water to k eep them healthy and he used it with his dogs. He even injected it i nto his dog = s veins once when it was sick and his dog was cured in several hours. I often dropped by his home to see how things we re going. Bill Denicolo sent a contract to my house in Las Vegas, Nevada , where I had retired from gold mining. The contract was quite generous. I was to be paid a reasonable salary, and I would hav e 20% ownership in the operation, provided I located gold in th e jungle. I signed a copy of the contract and sent it off, and rec eived an airplane ticket in return. I was 64 years old but in top condit ion and I would have no trouble navigating in the jungle. The country was Guyana. The name had been changed a few years earlier from British Guyana to simply Guyana. Guyana is the c ountry just south of Venezuela on the east coast of South America. Yo u probably remember it from the story of Jim Jones and his cult. The entire cult committed suicide at one point or actually a few c ommitted suicide after killing the children and many of the other adul ts with cyanide. Only a few survived. I arrived in Guyana on a normal day while it was raining, about midyear of 1996. I was met by several local people who would be part of the mining operation and they led me through the lines at the airport with no waiting. We drove about 30 miles to Georgetow n, See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The Discovery  Chapter 1  Page 3 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century Guyana = s largest city which is also the Capitol. I was taken to a local house where I was to stay until we departed for the interior, w here we would prospect Guyana = s greatest rain forest and jungle. At the house I met Mike, a local who owned the claims to a very la rge portion of the jungle, would be one of the partners. Joel Kane , who lives in the eastern part of the U.S., was also one of the partn ers listed on the contract I signed. He was to arrive within two weeks bef ore we departed for the jungle. There was one other partner, who w as also supposed to arrive soon, but probably after we departed for the jungle. His name was Beta and he was related to a high official in the government. The high official = s name was Moses Nagamotoo, and he was the First Minister directly under the Prime Minister. (Beta = s real name was Satkumar Hemraj, but he preferred the name of Beta.) Beta was not present, but because he was our partner I was invi ted to the First Minister’s, (Moses Nagamotoo) house for dinner th e second evening that I was there. While at his house the First Ministe r complained of his back problem that was almost preventing hi m from doing his job in the government. I explained to him that I some times adjusted people = s necks and I might be able to help his back. So after dinner he allowed me to adjust his neck, which I did very delic ately, making sure that I did not jerk or hurt him. Within minutes his back problem began to subside. We were all amazed and soon he was walking quite easily around the house. The next day one of the servants called me and asked if I would adjust Mose = s daughter = s neck, as she was having bad back problems as well. I agreed over the phone, so they picked me up for dinne r that night which was the third evening I was there and after di nner I adjusted her neck. Her name was Angela. He had another daught er named Adila, but she did not have a problem. Angela, as amazin g as it may sound, was soon walking easily and her back problem see med to disappear. I did not always have such spectacular results , but sometimes it did happen. I was very glad that I had taken the ti me to learn to adjust necks. Making such a powerful friend as Moses See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"The Discovery  Chapter 1  Page 4 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century Nagamotoo was important. I did not realize how important it w as at the time, but no doubt it kept me from spending time in prison a t a later date. For the record and future researchers, Sam Hinds was the Prim e Minister. Jim Punwasee was the Minister of Mines whom we ofte n went to see and occasionally visited in his home. The government had a gold laboratory where they bought gold f rom local miners. The problem was that all gold that came in was completely covered with mercury. They put the gold under a ho od and used a blow torch to burn off the mercury before weighing t he gold. Well, as everyone knows, mercury fumes are extremely poisonous. Those fumes were going up the exhaust stack and ou t into the government courtyard and into the government compl ex area. Many people had complained of this practice and when th ey gave me a tour of their gold facilities this was mentioned. I o ffered to design a simple fume scrubber and they took me up on my offer. They had very little money for such refinements, so I designe d the scrubber from two 55 gallon barrels. It just so happened that I had several thousand ping pong balls stored in a warehouse in Las Vegas. I had them shipped to Guyana to be used in the scrubber. By the time the balls arrived, I was in the jungle, but they simply po ured the ping pong balls into the barrel designed to use them, turned o n the water spray, and it was working when I returned. I t did the job. As luck had it, with the mercury scrubber, and helping the fir st Minister and his daughter I hit it off very well with a few offi cials in the government there. I had a friend that wanted to move from Russ ia to Guyana and I mentioned this to the Minister of mining and a cou ple of days later I got a call from the Minister of Immigration say ing that I could call my friend and tell him to visit the Guyana Consulat e in Moscow. He said there were papers waiting for my friend there that would allow him to immigrate to Guyana. So you can see I really did have a little bit of pull. I mention this merely to illustrate my good luck. See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The Discovery  Chapter 1  Page 5 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century In our first expedition into the jungle we would be taking eig ht men who would carry the supplies and set up camp as we reached vari ous locations. Our workers were called droggers. These men were hired by Mike and they arrived at the house about a week ahead of time to begin putting supplies and equipment together. One of the dr oggers was the foreman and the others, of course, were wor kers. Finally the time for our expedition arrived and neither Joel nor Beta had arrived, but we couldn = t wait. The men only made $6.00 a day (U.S. money), but that still cost to keep them around and we wa nted to get things done. So the final crew consisted of me, Mike the landholder, and the eight droggers. The trip into the interior took about two days. First there wa s about an hour = s ride from Georgetown to the town of Parika on the Mazaruni Cuyuni River. We loaded our supplies onto a large tr uck and four taxies. We arrived at Parika at about 9:00 a.m. and lo aded our supplies onto several large speed boats. The river at thi s point is more than five miles wide. Should you decide to do your own research on this part of the story, you will find that the next leg of the journey took us about four hours at what can be called high spe ed on that river. We finally arrived at our next destination, the town of Barti ca, which is considered the gateway to the interior of the country of Gu yana. There we bought mostly food supplies. There are a number of fo od stores constructed like warehouses which mostly supply exc ursions into the interior. Our buyer bought mostly beans and rice. No rmally, they buy only rice for such trips, but because I was there, the y added several sacks of beans. On other trips I was able to get them to buy more variety of groceries. We then loaded all supplies into several boats and crossed th e river to a port on the other side about one mile away where we transferr ed our supplies and equipment into two very large trucks. The tr ucks See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"The Discovery  Chapter 1  Page 6 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century had wheels that were more than six feet in diameter for drivin g through the roads consisting mainly of mud there in the jungl e. Even those big wheels could not go where there were no roads. The supplies were tied down securely and most of the men then elec ted to walk on a somewhat shorter route to the next jump-off point in to the jungle. I soon learned why they preferred to walk. The road wa s so rough and the trucks bounced so badly that it took constant at tention to just hold on. There was no sleeping during the five hours th at the trucks took to arrive at the final jump-off point on the last r iver leg of our journey. We arrived after dark as it always gets dark at 6:00 p.m. and ge ts light at 6:00 a.m. in the jungle near the equator. We slept wherever we could that night. I slept on a bench outside of the small store there. The next morning we again loaded all of our supplies in boats a nd continued up what was now the Cuyuni branch of the river. Boat s in this river are usually loaded to the gills, as the saying goes . The sides of these boats were less than four inches above the water. It w ouldn’t require a very large wave to come over the side one time and the boat, loaded as it was, would sink to the bottom. However, it j ust happens that there are almost never any large waves in these r ivers. No storms ever happen in the jungle. It rains terribly hard, b ut very little wind accompanies the rain and so storms simply do not o ccur. In fact, there are no natural disasters in this area of the wor ld, i.e. there are no storms, no hurricanes, no forest fires , or earth quakes. We traveled upriver for about four hours and arrived where th e real last jump-off point actually was. After we unloaded the boat s and they pulled away, the men began loading themselves with supp lies. The droggers carried their loads against their backs, but th e weight was on their heads. A strap went around the top of their heads a nd down to the pack against their back. They claimed that this wa s the least tiring of any method of carrying loads. They carried lo ads of up to 80 pounds through the jungle and mountains. It was now abou t 10:30 a.m. We would have to travel up over a jungle mountain to the other side. Well we called it a mountain, but hills are not See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The Discovery  Chapter 1  Page 7 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century considered mountains in that area until they are 1,000 feet h igh. This hill was 997 feet high, and by the time we had climbed to the top , we were certain it was a mountain. The mountain was totally covered with jungle. In this area, w here the humidity is 100%, and sometimes even 110%, it does not matter if it rains or not. One is very soon soaking wet as the perspiration cannot evaporate. All clothes are soaked. Those who bring leather b oots will have boots full of water, because either the rain or the sweat will soon fill them. Keeping an eye on what the locals wear, I wore only t ennis shoes. Boots offer some protection from snakes, but they bec ome almost impossible to use after a short time because they are s oon filled with perspiration. I decided to just be extra careful in watching for snakes. Some of the men had to make several trips over the mountain in order to get all of our supplies to the other side. It took almo st two complete days of travel to arrive at our campsite. This gives you an idea of how far out in the jungle we were. Several days later wh en two of our men came down with malaria, we were plenty worried. We had been assured that there was no malaria in this area of th e jungle and we had not thought to bring malaria medicine along with us. I immediately sent two men running to the closest mining c amp hoping that they might have malaria drugs. That would take at least two days, and if they had no malaria medicine it would be at lea st six days before the men returned. We simply had to accept those fa cts because it was the best we could do. We might have tried calling a helicopter, but we didn = t have a radio. Radios don = t work in the jungle anyway, except for very short distances. Considering all of the data that I had learned abo ut Stabilized Oxygen, it seemed to me, knowing it killed pathog ens in water, that it might cure malaria. I sat down with the men who h ad malaria and asked them if they would be interested in trying t his A health drink @ from America. They were very sick and suffering. They laid in their hammocks shivering from the chills, and at the See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"The Discovery  Chapter 1  Page 8 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century same time with high fever. Their symptoms included headache s, aching muscles and joints, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. They were willing to try anything and they said so. I gave them both a healthy dose of the stabilized oxygen in som e water and they drank it straight down. I thought, that = s all I can do for now; we = ll just have to wait for the runners to return. In one hour the shivering had stopped. That didn = t mean much as the shivering comes and goes, but they looked a little better. Four hours la ter they were setting up kidding about how bad they had been feeling. T hey got up out of their bunks and sat down at the table to eat dinner that evening. The next morning two more men had come down with malaria. They took the same doses of Stabilized Oxygen and th ey were feeling okay by noon. We all were amazed. (This is not the whole story, and Stabilized Oxygen does not work al l the time.) I continued with the gold prospecting. I had developed a meth od of assaying for gold (that means to determine the amount of gold that is present) that was quite simple. I was able to conduct assays m yself instead of having to send my assays off to a lab somewhere and w ait a couple of weeks for the answer. Soon I had located some gold deposits and we began planning to put up a gold mill in the jung le. This is not a story about gold, so to make a long story short, wh ile putting up a gold mill and doing further gold prospecting, I d id quite a bit of traveling in the jungle. Wherever I went, I treated pe ople for malaria (and sometimes typhoid fever). Although the Stabil ized Oxygen worked only about 70% of the time, it was enough to make me quite famous in the jungle. On the way back to town during that first trip into the jungle, we reached a mining operation that was shut down for vacation. T here were a number of men who were merely waiting for the mill to sta rt up again. One of the men was sitting at a table looking very sic k. I asked him what was wrong and he said that he was waiting for a bo at to pick him up. He said he had typhoid fever and malaria at the same time. I mentioned my Stabilized Oxygen which I merely ca lled See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The Discovery  Chapter 1  Page 9 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century a health drink and he said he would try it. On my return from tow n he came running out to meet me. He grabbed my hand and pumped it up and down. He told me that he had gotten better within hour s after I left and he didn = t have to go into town after all. I left him with a small bottle of drops, as I had done in other pla ces in the jungle. There were a number of good stories like that one, but unfortu nately at that time there were a lot of people it did not help. Still, i t was a treatment that got much better results than the malaria medi cines used there. People in malaria areas cannot afford to take the malaria preventive medicines as side effects always develop after a time. Visitors can usually only afford to take malaria medicines f or a short period. Thus, the locals never take the malaria preventativ e medicines. They have to depend upon being cured by the standa rd malaria medicines after they contract malaria, and unfortu nately malaria has developed a resistance to those medicines. Visi tors can only afford to take malaria medicines for a short period. As i t turned out, several of my associates were hospitalized as a result o f the malaria preventive medicines. I visited a missionary clinic near one of the mining villages in the jungle. They had, as I remember, four beds. I offered the A health drink @ to them, but they said to me that malaria was a disease visited upon the people of the jungle because of their sinful sex prac tices and that they did not believe that God wanted them to have a cure fo r malaria. There was nothing I could do to change their minds. I felt terrible to see those people suffering, but I had to leave. I w on = t mention the religion involved as I feel that they must have ch anged their mind about helping malaria victims by this ti me. Back in Georgetown I telephoned a friend, Bob Tate, about the Stabilized Oxygen curing malaria. He immediately flew to Gu yana. We discussed it and decided to see if we could sell the Stabili zed Oxygen in Guyana. We put an ad in the local paper stating that o ur solution cured malaria. That was a mistake. Immediately the local television station sent reporters over to our place and we we re on TV See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"The Discovery  Chapter 1  Page 10 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century telling about our solution. Then the radio and newspaper rep orters arrived. We were famous for about three days. Then the government dropped a bomb on us. The minister of health calle d us in for an interview. She told us that if we sold our solution to one more person that we would be in their prison and that we wouldn = t like their prison. I had seen the prison and I kne w that she was right. I talked to my friend, the First Minister, Moses Nagamotoo, o ne evening and he explained to me that two drug companies had cal led the Minister of Health and threatened to quit shipping drugs to the local hospital if she didn = t do something about the person claiming to be able to cure malaria. He explained that there was nothing h is government could do at this time to help me, but he mentioned t hat he suggested to the Minister of Health that she giv e me some latitude. At that point I made an even bigger mistake. Although we remov ed our ad from the newspaper, I continued to sell the solution to more people who needed it. My partner, Bob Tate, had already gone home, but I was still planning to do gold mining in the jungle. We were just about ready with our mining supplies when I got word that they were going to charge me with a crime and that it would be be tter if I were gone or were somewhere else. I found that people in Georgetown are more afraid of the jungle than are people from Las Vegas. They seldom chase people in the jungle. I immediately made the trip up the river and the supplies followed me a few days later. This is the basic story of the discovery that Stabilized Oxyg en sometimes cures malaria, however, that is only the beginnin g of my story. I did not consider it a Miracle supplement, yet. I stay ed upriver for slightly over six months working on the gold reco very mill. That part of the operation I financed myself because Joel Kan e was very slow in arriving and never provided additional money. W hen he finally arrived, after he saw some of the gold that my mill w as recovering, he wanted complete ownership, and offered me 3% instead of the 20% in the contract. When I did not agree, he had Mike the owner of the land and the droggers that Mike had hired , tear See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The Discovery  Chapter 1  Page 11 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century down my working mill and carry it off into the jungle. I know th at’s what he did, because he told me so. According to the contract, if he did not use my technology he did not need to give me 20%. The problem for him was, that the new technology that Mike, the landowner, implemented didn = t work. Thus not only did I lose my investment but he lost his as well. He was a millionaire and re ally didn’t care, but it was a little tougher on me. When I came back to town after those six months, all the Health Ministy problems had blown over and I left for the USA. I lost m y investment money, but I had the knowledge of what the Stabili zed Oxygen could do and it was very exciting. I no longer cared abo ut the gold. I couldn = t wait to get home to begin a testing program to find out why the Stabilized Oxygen only worked part of the time. I went back to Guyana a couple months later when another compa ny hired me to help them improve their recovery of gold. I was sti ll working with the Stabilized Oxygen. One night I was careless and allowed myself to be bitten hundreds of times by mosquitoes. It really wasn = t planned, but when the mosquitoes started biting, I just let them bite. Several days later I began to develop malaria. The very first symptom is just that you have light indigestion at a meal. It = s not very pronounced, only a slight feeling of nausea that pa sses in about 15 minutes. You don = t feel the real nausea until the next day. Since I did get sick, I decided that I might as well check out my own medicine. So I decided to wait until I got a blood test at the ho spital in Georgetown before starting any treatment. That was almos t a fatal mistake. The bus that runs from that part of the jungle to Georgetown did not come and I know that almost always people w ho wait too long for treatment end up dead. I waited a couple of da ys for the bus, but it didn = t arrive and I was getting very sick. Still, I wanted to make absolutely certain, with a blood test, that I h ad malaria.

In that part of the jungle they d o have a radio and a nearby landing strip. The plane finally came the next day (now my fourth day of being sick). I rode a bicycle to the la nding strip. By this time I was very sick . When I arrived in Georgetown, they put me in a taxi and took me straight to the h ospital. At the hospital I waited several hours for a blood test. I was d efinitely showing the malaria symptoms. The doctor told me that my bloo d tested positive for malaria. I was an outpatient, so he just g ave me a small bottle of malaria pills. Of course, I did not take the pi lls; instead I took a large dose of my own medicine. Within hours I was feeli ng better. It worked for me. To top it off, I went back to the hospi tal and had another blood test taken that now showed negative for malaria. I was elated! I was the first patient to have a blood t est both before and after taking the Stabilized Oxygen. I believed I h ad discovered a cure for malaria. I planned to leave Guyana right after I tested negative for ma laria. I was riding my Honda motorcycle that I bought when I first arri ved in Guyana around the city. As I rode along the street I met an old f riend from Canada who was there to do some diamond mining. I stopped and we shook hands and sat down at a sidewalk café to talk. As we were talking, he noticed a friend shuffling along the street . He called out and the friend came over. We were introduced and he was invited to sit down. He looked very tired and just a little sic k. I asked him what was wrong and he said malaria. He said that the drugs t hat the hospital was giving him didn = t seem to be helping much. I said, A well, you just happened to come to the right place. @ I explained what I had just found out about curing malaria and said, A If you will wait just several minutes I will ride home and get y ou some solution to take. @ He agreed to wait.

The plan was to set up and manufacture my own special mining equipment in order to make a living while also investigating the Stabilized Oxygen that I had used in the ju ngle. Unfortunately, during my exchange of Guyana money for Ameri can money before departing Guyana, a large sum of money was stole n from me as I had no experience with the money system there. Therefore, our funds for investing in the mining equipment manufacturing business were very limited. I sold my 40 foot o cean going houseboat for a small sum, which helped a lot . We worked our mining equipment business for about a year but t hen Bob began to develop the terrible illness known as Lou Gehrig ’s disease and was unable to do much work. The sales of the equipm ent began to falter for many reasons. The magazine in which we advertised made a big mistake with our advertising and then r efused to give us credit for the mistake, which cost us thousands. Ev entually I ended up living on my Social Security income. However, at ti mes I did get to do an assay or two, which helped. With my son’s help furnishing me with a computer and using the Internet, I began writing to various pen pals in Africa. Fina lly, I made friends with a man in Tanzania who took people on safaris to th e Mount Kilimanjaro. His name was Moses Augustino. I realized that he was mainly interested in making friends with people in Ame rica because he hoped to come upon some kind of an opportunity. Had I been in his shoes I might have done the same thing. He soon aske d me for $40. I realized that to him $40 was a lot of money, and actually at that time, $40 was quite a bit to me as well.

Moses was the first man to cure someone in Africa o f malaria using the MMS. They treated many people after these letters were written an d I did get more data concerning the Stabilized Oxygen (Humble Heal th Drink). Meanwhile, I was working to find out what chemical the Stabil ized Oxygen really was and how it was made. I needed to find out why i t wasn’t 100% effective. I learned that Dr. William F. Koch fir st started working with this solution in Germany back in 1926. He used it in conjunction with mentally retarded children, because he be lieved that the Stabilized Oxygen produced nontoxic oxygen identical t o the oxygen produced by breathing. Dr. Koch used his formula for t he next 10 years believing that this formula somehow increased oxygen to the brain of the retarded children. Unfortunately, that w as not the case. The problem was that either the chemistry was not moder n enough for Dr. Koch to understand exactly what the formula wa s doing, or he just didn’t understand chemistry well enough. The formula found its way to the U.S. around 1930. Over the yea rs See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS.."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Further Development of the Miracle Mineral Suppleme nt Chapter 2 Page 6 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century those who could finally dig out the actual formula began to ad d it into various products thinking that it was a form of oxygen that th e body could make use of. Researchers concerning Stabilized Oxyge n since that time have continued to make the same mistake. The fact is that what is now called and has been called Stabilized Oxygen for t he past 80 years contains no oxygen that the body can use. In order to b e useful to the body, oxygen must be oxygen in its the elemental state. That means no charge. In other words, oxygen cannot be an ion f orm of oxygen. The oxygen that is in Stabilized Oxygen is oxygen i n an ionic form with a minus two charge. Saying that the body can us e the oxygen in Stabilized Oxygen is like saying that the body can u se the oxygen in carbon dioxide. Do you see? Carbon dioxide has two i ons of oxygen with the same minus two charges. If you breathe only carbon dioxide you will die. The oxygen in Stabilized Oxygen merely becomes part of the water in the body. Water is made up of oxyge n and hydrogen and in that condition, oxygen and hydrogen do no t destroy any pathogens at all. I was later amazed to find that s everal universities had also made this same mistake. Of course, at t hat point I did not know any better either. I just knew the solution need ed to be improved. When you take a breath of air you are taking millions of oxygen atoms into your lungs. When you breathe out, guess what, you a re breathing oxygen out in the form of carbon dioxide. The amoun t of oxygen going out is the same as the amount that came in. But the going out is carbon dioxide. You see, the dioxide is oxygen, b ut it is spent oxygen (so to speak). The thing that the oxygen does tha t keeps the body alive is it oxidizes things in the body. Oxidat ion consists of the oxygen atom accepting electrons which destr oys poisons and neutralizes chemicals and releases heat energy and in the process creates carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide or some ot her combination. When the oxygen accepts the electrons, it is no longer an oxygen atom but it becomes an oxygen ion with a minus two charge. If it already has a minus two charge, as it does in Stab ilized Oxygen, it cannot oxidize anything and thus it is of no value t o the body as oxygen . See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS.."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Further Development of the Miracle Mineral Suppleme nt Chapter 2 Page 7 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century So if it isn’t oxygen that comes from the so called Stabilized Oxygen and that kills the malaria parasite, what is it? You know, fin ding the formula for Stabilized Oxygen was a hard thing to do back in 19 98 if you had a limited knowledge of chemistry. Everyone who had th e formula wasn’t telling and even when they sold it, they would not put the ingredients on the label. I did find one company that gave instructions for using Stabilized Oxygen. They said that af ter you put the drops into a glass of water it became unstable and thus you should never wait more than one hour before drinking the mixt ure. I thought that was interesting. So I put 10 drops into a glass of water, waited for about eight hours and then smelled it, like chemis ts often do. I thought I smelled chlorine . I realized that if water did make the Stabilized Oxygen unstable, it was because the water had mad e it less alkaline (more neutral). I had been using 10 drops, but by tha t time I was getting the idea that I would have to use more drops. After adding 20 drops of Stabilized Oxygen to a glass of water, I dec ided to add a little vinegar because it is a food that contains an acid called acetic acid which I knew would make it less alkaline than even water would. I waited for more than 24 hours this time and then I coul d detect a much stronger smell of chlorine. By that time my friends in Africa trusted me, to some small ext ent, so they were willing to give it a try. They started using the impr oved formula of 20 drops of the Stabilized Oxygen in a full glass of water with one teaspoon of vinegar. After waiting 24 hours they the n gave it to several of those who were not helped with the original fi rst dose. It worked in every case when they used the vinegar and waited 2 4 hours. To test my mixture, I bought some chlorine measuring sticks u sed for swimming pools, and guess what? After a few hours, the mixtur e began to measure a slight amount of chlorine and after 24 hour s it measured at least 1 ppm (part per million) of chlorine. That r eally wasn’t the total answer, but I was getting closer. I didn’t re alize it at first, but the sticks were measuring chlorine dioxi de . See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS.."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Further Development of the Miracle Mineral Suppleme nt Chapter 2 Page 8 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century Next I put a lid on the glass containing the mixture, and found that it developed the same strength of chlorine in two hours as it did in 24 hours without the lid. That is, of course, so long as I also use d the vinegar. The reason was that the chlorine was not going off in to the air nearly as fast. I transmitted this data to Tanzania and th ey began to use this new procedure. They added the teaspoon of vinegar , used a lid and waited for two hours before giving it to the mala ria victims. It worked every time. They were not havi ng any failures. This all sounds easy now, but I did more than 1,000 different t ests over a period of one year to figure out all these A simple @ things. My money was very limited and swimming pool test strips were expensive, as well as the various chemicals that I needed to d o the testing. I must admit that I didn’t do anything really smart o r brilliant, I just blundered along with my slight knowledge of the chemis try of metallurgy. There was also the fact that I was a research engi neer in the Aerospace industry for almost 25 years. I set up tests for A-bombs and that sort of thing. So I did have some experience at doing t ests. I tried a dozen or more acids and a hundred combinati ons. The two-hour wait was okay for the doctor, but for my friend Mo ses Augustino it wasn’t very practical. He was always on the move and would run into cases of malaria on his travels. He needed a met hod of giving people doses within five minutes or so, as he simply could not wait two hours all the time. Stabilized Oxygen is stable b ecause of its very high alkalinity. (That is the opposite of acidity .) When a few drops are added to a glass of water, the alkalinity of the d rops is neutralized by the water and ions in the drops become unstabl e and begin to release chlorine. At least that is what I thought at t he time. So the question is, how do we get this to happen fa ster? The research waited for the purchase and testing of differen t acids, which I finally accomplished. After trying all the mineral a cids and various organic acids, I found that vinegar, which is 5% acet ic acid, which is an organic acid, worked the best. Then I made a mini See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS.."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Further Development of the Miracle Mineral Suppleme nt Chapter 2 Page 9 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century breakthrough which was simple. Instead of using a glass of wa ter, I used no water at all. I just put 20 drops of stabilized oxygen a nd 3 teaspoon of vinegar in a clean, dry, empty glass. I swirled it around to mix it. That worked, and it worked in only three minutes! I checked the mixture with the chlorine strips and it showed a r eading of over 5 ppm (parts per million) in only three minutes’ time a nd when I added 2 glass of water it diluted the mixture out to less than 1 ppm, but the taste was terrible. The Stabilized Oxygen mixtu re with water doesn’t taste too bad before the chlorine is released, but afterwards it’s pretty bad. Some people don’t seem to mind th e taste but most people do, and children do, and they are the main ones who will need the solution. I tried various juices to see which ones might work the best. T here were two problems. First I needed something that would taste okay, but I also needed something that would not change the amount o f chlorine. After trying many juices and tasting a lot of drink s I settled on just plain old apple juice, the kind with no vitamin C added . I transmitted this information to my friends in Tanzania and t hey used it for a few months. Then something happened and I never heard from them again. I worry that my friend Moses may have been injured on one of his trips to Kilimanjaro as he simply droppe d out of contact. The doctor explained to me that he had not heard from him either. The doctor also mentioned that he was going to move. I never heard from either of them again, although I sent numero us e- mails. They gave me a great deal of help and I miss their e-mails. You may be wondering at this time what the formula for Stabili zed Oxygen really is. I did finally dig out the formula for Stabil ized Oxygen. I am sure that a lot of researchers would have found it in 2 hour, but living on a desert lake with a very limited income it took me a while. Anyone in the world can find the data now-a-days, b ut let me save you some trouble. The formula is NaClO 2 . The name is sodium chloriTe . That sounds like salt, but not quite. Table salt is NaCl, and the name is sodium chloriDe. Notice the difference of the last two letters, or the second to the last letter. One is chlo rite , and See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS.."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Further Development of the Miracle Mineral Suppleme nt Chapter 2 Page 10 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century the other is chloride . So let me tell you the real story that all the other researchers seem to have missed. Let me mention now that the chlorine I smelled was actually ch lorine in the air above the solution, but there was no chlorine in the solution. I discovered that what is in the solution is Chlori ne Dioxide which is much different than chlorine. Sodium chlorite (Stabilized Oxygen) is highly alkaline, th at is the opposite of acid. When it is neutralized it becomes unstable and begins to release, not oxygen, but rather chlorine dioxide. But that is where the oxygen comes in. The formula for chlorine dioxide i s ClO 2 . That’s one ion of chlorine and two ions of oxygen, but the body cannot use that oxygen. It has already lost its ability t o oxidize. The chlorine dioxide ion however, in this case, has a powerfu l ability to oxidize. Chlorine dioxide is a powerful explosive. It can not be contained as it will explode and destroy the container. It is always generated where it is used because it cannot be moved. Even a particle as small as one ion of chlorine dioxide will explode when it hits the right thing, namely a pathogen in the body or some oth er item more acidic than the body. An explosion is merely a fast chemical reaction, releasing e nergy, which is usually some kind of oxidization. When a chlorine di oxide ion meets a pathogen it accepts five electrons of charge and instantaneously results in an instant oxidization, which i s the explosion. The result of this explosion (the result of this c hemical reaction) is that the chlorine ion is completely neutralize d. The two oxygen ions that were a part of the chlorine dioxide ion are al ready neutral which for oxygen is a minus 2 state. That means that th e oxygen ion cannot oxidize anything, it can only become a part of the water in the body but the body cannot utilize it for any kind of oxidation. The chlorine ion becomes a chloride which basica lly is just table salt which has no particular power either. Both the oxy gen and the chlorine now do not have any charge that will create any ki nd of oxidation. So you see it’s the chlorine dioxide ion (the comb ination See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS.."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Further Development of the Miracle Mineral Suppleme nt Chapter 2 Page 11 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century of chlorine and oxygen) that does the work and it is hundreds o f times more powerful than oxygen alone. Another fact is, that several deep breaths of air will supply more oxygen to the human body than the stabilized oxygen is expect ed to supply. And since the formula was supposed to produce oxygen identical to the oxygen in the respiration process, what wou ld be the point to taking the Stabilized Oxygen when you could just tak e a couple of extra breaths? Anyway, it’s a moot point. The fact i s, what the researchers believed was happening was not happening. T he oxygen just becomes a part of the water in the body and/or poss ibly becomes part of a carbon dioxide ion, but it cannot be used by t he body for anything else. Chlorine dioxide supplies electrons, but it does not supply oxygen. Basically, the chlorine dioxide ion is the oxidizer, not the oxygen. Check your chemistry book. Oxygen is not the only oxidizer. A ny reaction in which electrons are transferred is considered o xidation. If the researchers that worked with Stabilized Oxygen had been able to understand modern chemistry, they may have been much more successful with their research. There is a lot more to it than this initial explanation and I intend to go over it thoroughly as I cover th e story of the development of the Miracle Mineral Supplement. It’s w ritten so anyone can understand it. At this time I moved a few miles to the town of Mina, Nevada wher e I continued writing emails to other people in Africa. Thirty miles away from where I lived in the town of Mina is the t own of Hawthorne, Nevada. There I met J. Andrew Nehring, a man tha t ran a small hobby shop. He had just returned from the Mayo Clin ic where he had been operated on for cancer of the pancreas. He wa s continuing to be tested at a hospital in a nearby city. Unfort unately, the tests were still positive for cancer. He had been schedul ed for exploratory surgery in approximately 60 days at the Mayo cli nic. While visiting a mutual friend, he heard me talking about my See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS.."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Further Development of the Miracle Mineral Suppleme nt Chapter 2 Page 12 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century solution. He asked me about it and wondered if it would help hi s cancer. Since many people had already tried Stabilized Oxyg en on cancer and had what seemed to be some success, I believed that the addition of vinegar might make it much better for cancer as it had for malaria. We both said why not try it. I had not yet noticed any side effec ts, and it is not a drug. So he began taking the solution using vine gar as the activator. Within two weeks his cancer readings began to reduce. The high reading was 82 (whatever that meant). At the next vis it to the hospital the reading was 71. A month later the reading was 55. Two months later it was 29 and so on until the reading was less t han five. The doctors at the hospital didn’t know what happened, but as soon as the readings began to go down, they canceled the appointment at the Mayo clinic. They wanted to see what might be happening. When the reading reached three they said there wa s no point in further testing. This is just one of a number of cance r stories in the past 10 years in which the cancer just went away while ta king the MMS. So at that time, my plan was still to get this information to th e world one way or another. I developed a plan where I would some of the story on the Internet to be distributed throughout the world . The way I planned to do this was to have the information in an e-mail re ady to send out to the world. I wanted it to be distributed similarly to the way viruses are often sent. When a person received this MMS information it would have a tiny program that would allow the person who received it to easily send it out to every email address on his computer. But of course he would be in total control. A person would only have to push one button and the complete informati on concerning using and making the MMS would go out to every emai l address on his computer that he so designated. Do you see how fast that could propagate across the world? It w ould go fast, but there are disadvantages. A book is even better, b ecause not nearly the amount of information in a bookcould be put int o e- See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS.."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Further Development of the Miracle Mineral Suppleme nt Chapter 2 Page 13 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century mails. I sold the one thing that I had, a special process for recovery of gold. I received $17,000 for the process. I searched around on the I nternet and finally found a company that claimed they could develop s uch a distribution program. I started working with them to get the program done. I paid $5,000 up front and several thousand as the progr am progressed and a large sum at the end. The program never worke d. So I never got a working program and I had spent my money. Just to be fair, let me tell you the name of the company that refused to furnish me with a working program after I gave them $14,000. I t was Danube Technologies, Inc. in Seattle Washington. They said when I made the final payment they would send me the working program. Their first proposal to me was dated 9 April 2001. My final payment to them was 11 November 2001. The program never came close to working. They claimed it did. They also sa id that the program was illegal. They would not do anything more . Now, 6 years later I finally worked out this program through w hich you received this book, but think of the hundreds of thousand s of people that didn’t get to use the MMS during that t ime. I know you think that with such a great Miracle Mineral Supple ment, philanthropists like Opra Winfrey and Bill Gates would stan d in line to give me money to carry out our mission, but not so. It takes a while to get it figured out, but finally you realize it is all b ased on money. Opra wants to know what is going to bring her TV program the biggest audience because that is what brings in the money , and Bill Gates gets no recognition for helping the little guy. Hi s millions go to the big pharmaceutical laboratories which in turn brin g him powerful friends throughout the world. To invest in somethi ng that works but reduces the income of the pharmaceutical companie s would be unthinkable. He said over the phone he would not back us until we had FDA approval. That takes a hundred million dolla rs and he knew we would never have that.

It wasn’t, for the most part, that they wouldn’t believe me. F or a hundred years the medical people and the pharmaceutical peo ple with their billions of dollars have stood shoulder to should er using the laws enacted by congress to hold the alternative medicine pe ople at bay. They have made them look like quacks and charlatans, but the fact is that millions of Americans have discovered that they are not. Despite medical warnings, every year more and more people discover answers in the alternative medicine area and now it is a several billion dollar business. You can’t possibly think t hat millions of Americans are so stupid that they would prefer quacks and charlatans if they were not getting real help with their heal th problems. And now, since the first edition of this book, the FDA has anno unced its intentions of shutting down at least 50% of the alternati ve medical businesses. The new law enacted by congress gives the FDA the right to require that all supplements be tested to prove their effi cacy. That means that the FDA can stop any supplement at any time and requ ire testing. It could cost up to $100,000,000 for a single supple ment. While more than900,000 people die from drugs each year, the h ealth industry does not average one death a year. But should someon e even report being sick from a health supplement the FDA can an d does stop every supplement of that kind in the country. In sev eral cases, even though nothing was wrong, the supplement was nev er allowed back on the shelves. Now with this new law, just from w hat they have said they are going to do, it is obvious that the FDA intends that nothing but drugs will eventually be available to those who are sick.

Dick Johnson, a friend, did this to help me out with my research. It gave me a few extra dollars to help with my research and investigat ion of the Stabilized Oxygen. During the first year there I met Arno ld, a man of many talents. I have changed his name, in this case to pr otect the guilty, because I am not going to say very many good things about him, though I will say a few. The Stabilized Oxygen mixture has been renamed several time s since I began to make the solution in my kitchen. It is not easy to get the chemical sodium chlorite, but if you keep at it you can get som e. (I’ll tell you how to get it in Book II. It is available in many chemic al supply houses.) I began making the solution much stronger th an the Stabilized Oxygen that is sold on the market. For many years Stabilized Oxygen was 3.5% sodium chlorite. At this time my solution, which I have named The Miracle Mineral Supplement (MMS), is 28% sodium chlorite. That’s eight times stronger t han regular Stabilized Oxygen. When I am making trips into the ju ngle, it means I can carry eight times as much “healing power” as the or iginal Stabilized Oxygen formula. Let me explain what has happened. The researchers over the pa st 80 years have done their tests using from 5 to 20 drops, at the mos t, of the 3.5% solution. As I started treating people for malaria a nd other diseases, when a few drops didn’t work, I just gave them more. In all the research I have been able to read concerning Stabilized O xygen, no one increased the drops beyond 25 and very few ever used tha t many. Where did the old idea go that if 10 drops is good, 40 drop s is 4 times as good?

I didn’t go from 10 drops of stabilized oxygen to 12 0 directly, but I finally wound up at 120 drops and used a second 120 drops one hour later. I did it a little at a time until I found ou t what it took to cure a disease. It is not a drug, it is a mineral supplem ent, and I am an inventor, not a doctor.

M y job has been to invent a sure cure for malaria ever since I thought it was possible and I did accomplish that. In my opinion, I have neve r put anyone at risk and I have treated over 2,000 people personall y. Over 75,000 malaria cases have been treated, mostly by people I tr ained. The people treated were cured and no deaths reported in the bu nch. Normally over 300 deaths could be expected. When I say cured, I’m referring to the fact that they got up, smiled, put their clot hes on and went back to work. They have not relapsed, as far as we can tell. Did we do double blind and triple blind tests? No. The money wa s not available. Bill Gates told us over the phone that he would not help until we were FDA approved. Usually, FDA approval costs millions, but those people in Africa that went back to work fe eling good didn’t care if we had FDA approval or not. When I phoned th e FDA they said that if I was using it in Africa they had no say ove r there so they would not comment, but if I wanted to get it appro ved for treatment of malaria in America, then that would be anoth er story. They didn’t care if it was not a drug. The minute I said treatme nt of any disease, it then becomes a drug and you must have all of the countless tests and laboratory evaluations. That’s anywhe re from $50,000,000 upwards. The country of Malawi has accepted MMS as a mineral supplemen t that can be given to anyone, including those who are sick. The y have shown a bit of reasonable logic. It isn’t likely to happe n here in the U.S. where the doctors and pharmaceutical companies hav e lobbied congress to the tune of billions of dollars to have al l the laws written in their favor and written to produce money for them.

However, when in one year just one single person died in one year from an amino acid found in a health food store, the FD A ordered all of that amino acid to be removed from all health fo od stores in the U.S. in spite of the fact that it has helped more p eople than most drugs, and now, years later, that amino acid is stil l not allowed. The drug companies and the FDA are always ready to pounce on anything that might eat into the profits of pharmac eutical companies. In this particular case that amino acid was repla cing a drug. It was costing the drug companies money. So long as one is using a mineral supplement in the attempt to m ake people feel better, there is no criticism. So long as one is us ing a mineral supplement attempting to make people healthier, th ere is no criticism, but the minute one attempts to treat someone for s ome specific condition with the same supplement that has been us ed for 80 years, then that is a different story. You must be a doctor, and you must do clinical trials, and you must have 100 million dollar s for double blind tests and triple blind tests, and dozens of othe r requirements. No one offers to furnish the money; they just t ell you what you are required to do. How dare you try to treat someone f or a disease! That’s for doctors and pharmaceutical c ompanies only. There are many people in America who realize that drugs only t reat the symptoms, and not the causes of a disease. Why would a company even bother to research treating the symptoms of a di sease instead of attempting to find a cure for the disease? Does any one ever ask that question? Well, a lot of us do, but not the FDA. Th e answer is this, so long as you are treating the symptoms, you w on’t cure the disease and you can go on selling that drug until the p erson dies. Several wealthy people offered to pay for distributing the M MS throughout the country of Haiti. They wanted to eliminate ma laria in Haiti. But when we approached more than 15 clinics there, we f ound that they were controlled by doctors in the U.S. The doctors i n the See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Stabilized Oxygen, MMS, and a Contract Chapt er 3 Page 4 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century U.S. were totally determined that we could not give a single p erson our mineral supplement. Haiti went without the supplement, and thousands still have malaria. In any case, it only takes 15 drops of Miracle Mineral Supplem ent (MMS) for the first dose given to a malaria patient followed an hour later with another 15 drops. This is because the MMS is eight t imes stronger than regular Stabilized Oxygen. If you were using r egular Stabilized Oxygen, you would need 120 drops at first and then another 120 drops in 1 hour after that. Has anyone been hurt? No. Thousands of patients later there a re only thousands of happy, well people with one claiming any la sting negative side effects. In actuality, there are a few instant reactions in about one out of a hundred people, but that’s not side effects . The reaction normally lasts less than 30 minutes. Look it up in a m edical dictionary or on the Internet. Side effects are the effect th at a drug has on healthy cells that are not a part of the disease. Instan t reactions are the result of the body adjusting because of the MMS is affecting diseased cells or disease causing germs. There ar e no effects on healthy cells. We know that the MMS (28% sodium Chlorite) generates chlorin e dioxide (that’s CLO 2 ) when mixed with vinegar. The reason why it produces chlorine dioxide when mixed with vinegar is becaus e the acetic acid (in the vinegar) causes the solution to be neutra lized, or better than that, causes it to be slightly acidic. The MMS sol ution is normally extremely alkaline. When it is made acetic, by addi ng the vinegar, it becomes slightly unstable and it begins to relea se chlorine dioxide. By measuring the drops and the acetic acid we know th at it creates about 3 mg of chlorine dioxide in approximately thre e minutes. Then when we add apple juice (or other juice without vitamin C) it dilutes the solution so that there is about 1 ppm of chlorine dioxide in the total apple juice mixture. The MMS so lution continues to generate chlorine dioxide, but now at a much slo wer rate. See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Stabilized Oxygen, MMS, and a Contract Chapt er 3 Page 5 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century About chlorine dioxide: Chlorine and chlorine dioxide have been used to purify water and kill pathogens in hospitals and for m any other antiseptic uses for more than 100 years. Lately chlori ne dioxide has been used more and more frequently, especially to purify water. It is also authorized by the FDA to be used to clean chicken, be ef and other foods. Research has proven chlorine dioxide to be much safer than chlorine, as it is selective for pathogens when used in w ater and it does not create compounds from other constituents in the w ater, which chlorine does. Simple chemistry tells us that without doubt the same situation exists in the body. It has been proven that chl orine in drinking water creates at least three different carcinogen ic compounds when it enters the body, but no such compounds have been found from chlorine dioxide. The American Society of Analytical C hemists stated in 1999 that chlorine dioxide was the most powerful pa thogen killer known to man. If this is the case, and it is, then you would have thought that the pharmaceutical companies would have said to themselves, “H mm, if chlorine dioxide is such a powerful killer of bacteria, viru ses, and other germs, and since it is used to kill viruses on food throu ghout that industry, maybe, just maybe it could be used to kill thos e things in the human body.” But no, they wanted a drug that makes you feel a little bit better and can be sold over and over again. No point in using something that’s going to cure someone on the first d ose. Pharmaceutical companies should have discovered it 100 yea rs ago, but they didn’t. You might say that is just my opinion, my trut h, but I am going to have to call it a fact because it is such an obvious t ruth. There is no excuse why research has not been conducted with a solution that has been used for 100 years to kill disease caus ing germs. The pharmaceutical companies not only didn’t do the research, but they actually refused to test the Stabilized O xygen many times. So what happens when you put Stabilized Oxygen in the body? It first goes down into the stomach at first. There are dozens of research See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Stabilized Oxygen, MMS, and a Contract Chapt er 3 Page 6 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century papers which state that when it comes in contact with strong s tomach acids that it breaks down into oxygen immediately. They have n’t, however, stated the tests that prove this hypothesis. I used stomach acids in a test glass and that result never happened. Even whe n I tripled the strength of the acid in the glass to three times wh at would normally be found in the stomach, it never broke the sodium ch lorite down immediately. In fact, it never increased the speed of production of chlorine dioxide beyond maybe 100th of a milli gram per hour, in other words, practically nothing. And, of cours e, creating chlorine dioxide and sodium (tiny insignificant a mounts of sodium) is all that can happen when the sodium chlorite does b reak down. There isn’t anything else left. That is all that’s ther e. The chlorine dioxide explodes when touching various items of lo wer acidity than the body by accepting four electrons with treme ndous energy and it will almost always be things that are bad for the body. Otherwise, it simply bounces off the healthy cells. There is more about this later in the book; see chapter 14. Again, chlorine dioxide is the oxidizer here, not oxygen. Without the use of vinegar, or lemon, or lime or citric acid, t iny amounts of chlorine dioxide is all that will be produced. Any benefit from the Stabilized Oxygen has to be derived from the tiny amo unt of chlorine dioxide because there is nothing else except an ins ignificant amount of sodium. Because there was indeed some benefit from Stabilized Oxygen, we know that the chlorine dioxide was doi ng it. The oxygen that is finally released by the chlorine dioxide i s not useable by the body. Because all Stabilized Oxygen sold on th e market today is a solution of sodium chlorite, there are no el ectrolytes of usable oxygen to be derived from Stabilized Oxyg en. With the addition of vinegar, the conditions change drastic ally. At first, with the 20 drops and 3 to 2 teaspoon of full strength vinegar, the body receives a dose of about 3 milligrams of chlorine dio xide in the mixture when the apple juice that has been added to the dos e. The solution then continues to generate chlorine dioxide fo r the next 12 hours within the body. See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Stabilized Oxygen, MMS, and a Contract Chapt er 3 Page 7 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century The red blood cells that normally carry oxygen throughout th e body have no mechanism to differentiate between chlorine dioxid e and oxygen. Thus in the walls of the stomach where the blood picks up nutrients of various kinds, when a chlorine dioxide ion touc hes a red blood cell it is accepted. If there happens to be a malaria par asite present it will be destroyed and, the chlorine dioxide will b e destroyed as well. If there are no parasites present, the chl orine dioxide will be carried by the red blood cell to some point in t he body where oxygen would normally be used to oxidize poisons and ot her bad things, and there the chlorine dioxide is released. The c hlorine dioxide has over a hundred times more energy to do the same thi ng that the oxygen would do but it still won’t hurt any healthy ce lls, more than likely because the immune system has the chlorine d ioxide under control. This is the point where I like to compare the chlorine dioxide ion to a good Tasmanian devil and the disease germs are the bad Terrorists. The Tasmanian devil is a small fellow , but is known for how ferocious he is. The red blood cell is the bus that carries oxygen, and the conductor doesn’t care, he will also carry the Tasmanian devil. Taz, the chlorine dioxide, is let off by the red blood cell at approximately the same spot that oxygen would normally be let off. The terrorists are not even worried. They can handle Mr. Oxygen. But this time there is a surprise. The guy that gets off the bus is ferocious. He’s much worse than the oxygen that normally gets off. He jumps out and kills every single terrorist that is present that is harmful to the body. So when the red blood cell bus arrives, MEET TAZ. If the chlorine dioxide does not hit anything that can set it o ff, it will begin to deteriorate and thus gain an electron or two. This ma y allow it to combine with other substances creating a very importan t substance that the immune system utilizes to make hypochlor ous acid. Hypochlorous acid is probably the most important acid of the See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Stabilized Oxygen, MMS, and a Contract Chapt er 3 Page 8 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century immune system. It kills pathogens, killer cells, even cance rous cells with this acid. When the body has a deficiency in the importan t substance, from which the immune system creates the hypochl orous acid, it is called myeloperoxidase deficiency. Many people are afflicted with this deficiency and the deficiency may incre ase during diseased situations, because the immune system needs a grea t deal more of this acid when a disease is present. There are some suppositions here. In any case we definitely k now that chlorine dioxide is made in the body from sodium chlorit e and it then kills the hell out of diseases. There is one other functi on that the chlorine dioxide does in the body. It tends to neutralize poi sons. Almost all substances that are poisonous to the body are, to s ome extent, acetic in nature or below the neutrality of the body. The chlorine dioxide will neutralize many of these poisons. We b elieve that can be the only explanation why a malaria patient often g oes from totally sick to totally well in less than four hours. The poisons that malaria generates are neutralized by the chlorine diox ide at the same time the parasites are killed. I dosed a dog that was bitt en by a rattlesnake. I gave him a drink of the solution every 2 hour. The dog seemed to know it would help him and he drank it right down each time I gave it to him. He was okay in a few hours, which woul d indicate that the poison was probably neutralized by the chl orine dioxide. While I was living in Mina, Nevada I was finally able to order t he first whole drum of 100 pounds of sodium chlorite. Actually, the sa me friend that helped me by providing a place for me to stay in Min a bought the first 100 pound drum of sodium chlorite. He droppe d by and took a few pounds to keep for himself as that would ensure t hat he would never be without it. For the record, his name is Richa rd Johnson. I began to treat some people here in town and some people began to buy the solution that I bottled here in my kitc hen. There are a number of people here in town that now has been usin g the MMS for several years. I have sent bottles all over the wor ld and many people have used it to treat cancer and every other disea se that See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Stabilized Oxygen, MMS, and a Contract Chapt er 3 Page 9 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century you can think of that would be caused by bacteria, viruses, mo lds, yeast or any other pathogen Eventually, as mentioned previously, I was approached by Ar nold, a businessman who lived in Reno and who also owned a nonworking gold mill here in Mina. He asked me to do some gold assays. We began talking and when I mentioned that I had a cure for malari a he was extremely impressed. We talked several times and in time we finally signed a contract. In the contract he agreed to finan ce making the MMS available throughout the world. He wanted to put up an Internet site in Budapest and sell MMS to the world from Budap est. I found him to be like many other wealthy men who think MMS is great. They want to get others to invest money, but they don’t want to invest any themselves. He began talking to numerous peopl e about the MMS and was able to interest many groups which were “humanitarian.” He called me and told me about each new group that he was talking to concerning investing in the cure for ma laria in Africa. Arnold is a great humanitarian. He works to help the homeless in Reno. He always stops to help anyone who might be broken down on the highway. He supplies a truckload of clothes and other i tems to an orphanage in Mexico each year. Many times when homeless or people down on their luck arrive in Mina he will either give th em a job himself or somehow get them a job with someone else here in town. He also helps out at various places in Reno including distributing meals to the homeless at Christmastime. He has been quite helpful to me in many ways and has worked toward getting the MMS distributed in Africa for the last 6 years. The problem was he never kept any of the agreements in the cont ract I made with him. Instead, he kept finding people who would “potentially” finance the MMS distribution in Africa to cur e malaria victims. We were always just weeks or months away from gettin g the money to distribute the MMS in Africa or to get the money to con duct clinical trials to prove to the world that it works . See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Stabilized Oxygen, MMS, and a Contract Chapt er 3 Page 10 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century Arnold began to use the MMS to treat people, as he is very compassionate toward people who are sick. He personally gav e MMS to many people after overseeing that they knew how to use it correctly. He found veterans who had malaria that kept comin g back and provided MMS for them. That was one way that he proved, to himself that it worked. However, I began to see that he would n ot let me talk to any of the groups that he had interested in helping t o finance the distribution of MMS to the world. I don’t know wha t his reasoning was, but it seems he is not as effective dealing wit h people as he thinks he is. Group after group lost interest in the MMS a nd simply did not continue with him and his ideas. Group after gr oup or person after person came and went away. Living out here in the desert, I never got to talk to any of thes e people or groups. I was always told about the people or the groups, bu t never allowed to talk to them. Even when I asked to be allowed t o talk to these people Arnold would not discuss it. This contin ued for five years and he made many mistakes, such as, hiring a young k id to do our web site, who then sued us when we insisted that the web s ite be done the way we wanted. The kid took us to court and also sent letters to government agencies saying that we were crooked a nd our MMS solution was a fake. Those letters prevented us from gett ing a letter from the IRS stating that we were a nonprofit group. At the writing of this book (10/1/2006), now 5 years beyond the time he was supposed to get the Web Site done, 10/1/2006 and thousand s of dollars later, we still don’t have a Web Site. Four additiona l people that have been hired have all bombed out and took our money and produced nothing. Had I been able to use some of this money tha t was lost I could have completed clinical trials in Kenya. Arn old also hired a grant writer, who also began to work against us. Arnol d was very bad with people while always thinking that he was especi ally good. I mention this negative stuff only to point out why I had to write this book. It’s part of the story, and getting the infor mation to the world is and has been my purpose.

But I finally realized that if I stayed with him it would have to be his way or nothing. If I wanted to get this information to the world I h ad to leave that partnership. It wasn’t happening Arnold’s way an d he would not allow any other way. Thus I had to get away where I could do it the way I knew it would work. The year at this time was 2006 and I could no longer justify kee ping this information from the world. There were and are millions of people who need the MMS. How could we allow those to die who could be saved? The answer for me at that time was, I could not. So I packed my bags and left about mid year 2006. But I am getting ahead of my story. There were several other important events that took place before I left.

Arnold talked to numerous people concerning the MMS (which we called OS-82) about treating and curing the people of malaria in Africa. He always had som eone that he believed might help provide us with funds, so that we could first prove the the MMS worked and then we could ask the world to help us cure Africa. I remained in Mina, Nevada, contin uing to write emails to people in Africa, many who didn’t believe me and some who even asked me to not write them again. Somewhere around July of 2003, my emails to Africa paid off. I finally got in touch with a doctor in Guinea, West Africa. His name was Dr. Moses Flomo Sr. I began telling him of the results that we had obtained in Tanzania. He was interested. I sent him a bottle of the MMS and he tried it on a single malaria patient who was well in only hours. He immediately went to the office of the Ministry of Health. Dr. Gamy was the Deputy Minister of Health at that time in Guinea. This picture shows Dr. Moses Flomo Sr. Dr. Flomo was able to deal with one of the doctors in the office of the Ministry of Health who then authorized him to test 25 people. He was to test those 25 people without charge and only if the MMS worked could he then begin charging people for the MMS as a treatment for malaria. Dr. Flomo put a large sign outside his clinic which said, “Free treatment for malaria.” Within hours he had more than 25 peop le signed up and he See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Dr. Moses Flomo Sr. an African Herb Doctor Chapter 4 Page 2 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century treated them the same day. He had them agree to co me back the next day for testing. The next day all the people who r eturned were malaria free. He began treating people for malaria for 5,0 00 fg (75 cents US) on October 1, 2003. People started lining up outside of his office. He continued treating people for a few weeks. Unfortunately, Dr. Flomo c ouldn = t really see the value of the MMS. He believed that he could make a lot of money from selling herb formulas in capsule form. The malaria thing was only something that he was doing to get me to help him w ith the herbs. I agreed to help him as long as he was working with m alaria. He wanted me to send him some empty capsules, and some herb b ooks, and a capsule filling machine, and other supplies. When I sent his package containing some books and a small semi automatic ca psule machine, his post office held it. He got so upset with them tha t he closed his clinic. It didn = t make a lot of sense to me, except he wasn = t from Guinea and he thought that was the reason he was being treating b adly. We later found that the postmaster had taken the pa ckage and put it on his desk. The next day he took sick and the packag e remained on his desk for two weeks. An accident happened and the p ackage was essentially destroyed by rain. Dr. Flomo decided to go out to an America Bauxite c ompany, the biggest one in that part of the world. He knew one of the doctors in the company clinic. So he took some MMS to the doctor and expl ained how it worked. They began treating workers who had malaria with the MMS. In all they treated about 2,000 people. At that ti me they reduced absenteeism by over 50%. Dr. Flomo began negotiati ng with them to sell them 150 bottles of MMS for $60,000 US money. That = s $400 U.S. per bottle. I had never intended to sell the bottl es for more than $26 US, but Flomo insisted that we could use the money to s et up a clinic. Since we had never settled on an exact price, I said okay . After all, that was still somewhat less than $1 U.S. per treatment. At that time, Arnold didn = t have complete control of the Malaria Solution. He hadn = t yet figured out how to get complete control. I st ill had some say in how things were handled. Later, Ar nold said that the people that were putting up the money wanted him to have complete control. At this time I was able to allow Dr. Flom o to sell the MMS. Later I was not allowed to do such things.

I determined the main proble m was that Dr. Flomo was making trips elsewhere working on the herb plan that he had. It was quite an extensive plan. He planned to have many acres planted with various different herbs. Dr. Flomo would not allow me to talk to the doctors at the Bauxite clinic. We had to go through him and he was busy elsewhere.  This is a picture of Dr. Flomo’s herb clinic. I decided to tell Arnold about the possible sales. That was a mistake. Arnold then tried to call the clinic at the America Bauxite Company, but he couldn = t get the right phone number. Then he got in touch with the U.S. Company that owned the Bauxite Company and got the phone number of the president of the America Bauxite comp any in Guinea. The president said that he would not use our MMS (O S-82) until some university had published a paper stating that they had tested the MMS and that it worked. That ended the $60,000 sale of bottles to the Bauxite company clinic, as the doctors there were informed that they could not use the MMS. Had we not tried to go through the fro nt office, the doctors in the back would have continued to use the MMS. ( This was a flub by Arnold. I didn = t want to stir things up in the front office of the American Bauxite Company as I realized that things were deli cately balanced.) If they had already been using the MMS for six months and the absenteeism had been reduced 50% during that time, no one would have said stop. As it was, the front office was never i nformed that they had already treated 2,000 people.

If he had continued to treat people for 75 cents each (a figure people there can afford) he would ha ve become rich in that area. He would have been the best known doctor in that part of the world. He chose to continue to try to sell herbs, which never did work. We would have furnished unlimited quantities of MMS to Dr. Flomo and he could have changed a whole country, but he just had to try to sell his herbs.

He understood chlorine dioxide because his scientific knowledge included w ater purification plants and disinfectants. I told him most of the t hings already mentioned in this book plus other data. He was int erested. I have found the exact facts work better than anything els e and that is what I gave him. Finally Dr. Opondo said, A I have the picture and if you can really get the chlorine dioxide into the body, I believe it wi ll do exactly what you say it will do. @ Once he had the picture of the chlorine dioxide in his head, he was convinced. So much so that he said, A My wife is sick with malaria. Can I go get her right now? @ I said, A Sure. @ She arrived about 20 minutes later. I mixed an MMS dri nk for her of only five drops. I considered 15 drops to be a standard dose at that time and I do not remember exactly why I only used five drops. I guess I was worried about making her nauseous. So Dr. Opon do = s wife was the first person I treated for malaria in Africa Th e next morning she was feeling a little better, but she was not comple tely well, and I had See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Kenya East Africa  Chapter 5  page 4 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century told him that she would be well. And I was schedul ed to start treating at the hospital that morning. That was actually a problem, but not as bad as you might think. The doctor believed my explanation of the chlorine diox ide and he seemed to have faith in what I had to say. The pro blem was that the strain of malaria here was more virile than the str ain of malaria in South America. In seeing that the doctor = s wife was indeed a little better, I knew it was working but that it simply wa s not a large enough dose. I told the doctor that his wife just needed another dose and he agreed. That morning when I began treating people at the mi ssion hospital, I put on my white lab smock with the words A The Malaria Solution Foundation @ embroidered in in gold lettering on the front. I wore my hat, light tan pants and white shoes. I looked like a doctor. I arrived at the hospital at about 8 A.M. and Dr. Opo ndo set me up in his office. I, of course, explained to the people in the office that I was not a doctor. They didn = t care. I was the only white man for 50 miles in any direction and they all had a great dea l of respect for white men. I discussed the number of drops to be given each patient with Dr. Opondo. I pointed out that the malaria here seemed to be a stronger strain than that in South America. We decided to use 15 drops per dose and soon his wife arrived to get her next dose. She received a second dose which was 15 drops and went on home. We gave the patients 15 drop doses all day, but the next day most of them came back, feeling better, but not well. That did it. I decided on 30 drop doses as we needed to get cures with only one dose. See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Kenya East Africa  Chapter 5  page 5 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century There were too many malaria victims to have to hand le each one twice. The hospital laboratory was overloaded. We simply could not check every sick person = s blood for malaria. However, in that area there isn = t much question about whether or not a person has m alaria. Normally a doctor merely looks at a person and reco gnizes malaria. But they did take as many blood samples as were pra ctical. All persons who tested positive to malaria by blood sam ple eventually tested negative after the second dose, or after the 30 drop dose. It usually took about four hours to have all malaria s ymptoms gone. In a few cases, it would take up to 12 hours for the s ymptoms to disappear. Although many had other diseases as wel l as malaria, we never had a failure as far as the malaria was conce rned. We cannot guarantee that fact, as everyone was not blood test ed, but to the best of our knowledge, there were no failures to kill th e malaria parasite. We treated the ones that were still feeling bad and all were recovered when they returned the next day. Dr. Opondo agreed with me that we should increase the dose to 30 drops. It began to work with only one treatment. This was eight times the dose that was used in South America. This would equal 240 drops of stabilized oxygen sold in health food stores. At the hospital, each malaria patient was introduced to me and those who could speak English would describe their symptoms a little bit. I gave a dose to ever yone. I did not try to just dose the malaria patients. I knew that the MM S would be good for most any problem that they had. Some would soo n throw up worms, and many others said that various difficulti es were better. The Reverend Ommini was head of the mission there a nd he looked a little tired. He told me that every since his ac cident he had not had any trouble with malaria. He walked with a cane an d he had some steel braces in his leg. He said that maybe the st eel was somehow causing a reaction in his blood that was killing th e malaria parasites. I looked in his eyes and face very closely. I coul d only see extreme tiredness. He was sick and didn = t know it. I asked if he was taking See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Kenya East Africa  Chapter 5  page 6 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century pain tablets, and he admitted that he took several each day. I said, “Reverend, please do me a favor and have your blood tested for malaria.” All of a sudden it seemed to occur to hi m; he realized how he really felt. Picture: Dr. Vincent Orimba talks with a mother About her baby who has just taken some MMS . I had actually meant for him to have the blood test the next day, but he took one more look at me and he went to wake up the laboratory technician. In about one hour he came back with an amazing report. The average malaria patient that showd up for treat ment at the hospital had a reading of plus six. Rev. Ommini ha d a reading of plus 120. He could have dropped dead at any minute . I gave him the biggest dose that I felt would be safe, which was 30 drops. Normally a person with that high of a reading would be sick in bed almost unable to move, but the pain killers in some cases will mask the symptoms. The next morning Rev. Ommani felt much better, but he was sick again by noon. At noon his blood was reading plus six which was a normal reading for a person sick with malaria. I g ave him another 18 drops and by the next morning he was proclaiming th at he felt great. He looked good. His blood read zero malaria parasi tes. He was lucky that it turned out this way. It happens many times that people take pain tablets to mask the pain of malaria. The y don = t realize it is malaria just as Rev. Ommani had not, but he believe d in me. They keep taking more and more pain tablets as their hea dache and the See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Kenya East Africa  Chapter 5  page 7 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century pains in their joints get worse and worse. That is a very dangerous condition as they can be walking around with enough malaria to kill them. When this happens one can just drop dead, wh ich does happen. Picture: People at church await our arrival. In all there were over 300 at this church. Rev. Ommani began organizing churches around the a rea so that people with malaria could come to be treated. Each morning about eight of us would crowd into a mini bus driven by P eter Mwangi a local pastor who owned the mini bus. The bus was a bout 20 years old. It was only a bus shell with a motor. Everyt hing else had been stripped out. The door hinges were far beyond wear ing out. They just sort of held the door from falling off, but ce rtainly not from rattling. Being the only white person, I had to ri de up front, but then so did three other people. Peter was somewhat of a mechanic, so he kept the bus going. But everything in the bus was extremely worn. When an auto gets that bad and something quits work ing you simply pull it out and throw it away. After all, all you really need is a motor, a chassis, and wheels. Peter would drive us to several churches during the day and he also helped me by taking pictures. There was usually an ywhere from 50 to 200 people at the various churches. They introd uced me to the crowd and asked me to say something before we got s tarted. I would talk for a minute or so, stating that it was my ple asure to be there and that I hoped that they would feel better.

When there were several hundred people I would ask for extra glasses and they would get some somehow. Then we w ould line up 20 or 30 glasses and I would begin putting the solu tion in the glasses. I had a small measuring spoon that held exactly the right amount of solution (30 drops). Then I would add vinegar to ea ch glass. I would then fill each glass with pineapple juice to about three quarters full. We would give the dose to each person. (There was always the three minute wait right after adding the vinegar and befo re adding the juice.) Several times when the group heard that I would not be inoculating them they would express disappointment. They felt that if they were not getting inoculated that the medicine might not be powerful enough to help. However, as the day wore on at eac h church, people started feeling better. Headaches went away , and nausea vanished, and/or muscle pains left. The people wer e quite surprised and pleased and they showed it. It was always a pl easure to see the people getting better and feeling better. While we were in Kakamega, Javan wanted us to visit one private clinic. We were to spend a full day at the clinic. The name of the clinic was The Bukura Community Nursing and Materni ty Home. When we arrived there was a big long line of local people who needed treatment for malaria. We spent most of the day there and then we left them with several bottles of MMS for t heir use. The head man = s name was Vincent Orimba. He treated many people and took their blood readings both before and afterward taki ng the MMS. Unfortunately, his clinic was one from which the su pport of the Missions to supplllllly them with MMS was withdrawn as far as supplying them with MMS when they suspected me of b eing evil. I have included a picture of Dr. Orimba at his clinic . No doubt that he, like most of the other people in this book can still be contacted. While in Kakamega I did not see any other white peo ple.

The lecture with the doctors and nurses was well received; they talked to me for an hour after the lecture. There was much handshaking and fri endly words, but for some reason Wade and his wife decided I was evil and that ended their plans to treat villagers in the nearby bu sh. They would never communicate about it so I had no way to tell them different. Even stranger than that, the head man at FCF I nt. in the US was fired a few weeks after I returned. He was the man in that organization that made the decision to send me over ther e. Maybe there was no connection, but it seems funny that he was fired and I never knew the reason. Well anyway, the story continues. From Nairobi I flew to Kampala Uganda. I was met at the Airport by Solomon Mwesige who was the main pastor of the mission ther e and the owner of the clinic that was connected to the mission. He drove me to his house. They had a room fixed up for me to stay in. Here in this area, everyone who comes into the house must take off his shoes. I didn = t notice that at first, but as soon as I did notice, I apologized and took my shoes off. They were very gracious hos ts. Dinner was served every evening with everyone sitting at the table. The food was very good. In Uganda, where they are not fighting , there is plenty of food. In fact, an observer would call it a la nd of plenty. Solomon said that I could start using the MMS in the morning at his medical clinic. I was anxious to get started as this would be o ne more test in proving out the MMS. I arrived at Solomon = s clinic, See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Uganda East Africa  Chapter 6  Page 2 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century after having breakfast at his home, at about 8 AM on the 14th of February 2004.

Picture: Author and nurse look on as mother gives her baby the MMS at the Life Link Medical Center in Kampala, Uganda. They were charging a small fee for my MMS doses (OS-82 was on the labels of the bottles at that time, but I had long since qui t calling it that back in Kenya, because A Malaria Solution @ was the only thing any of the doctors or nurses would call it. And that is what we f inally started calling it, as the people of Africa had actually name d it. When I called Arnold I gave him the new name and he immediately agreed.) I started off using the data obtained at the Kakamega mission in Kenya. I used 30 drops and almost everyone was getting sicker and vomiting after taking the drops.

Something was again different with this malaria than at the o ther place. All those here who had malaria had enlarged spleens. Somehow the drops were reacting with this strain of malaria differently, and it probably had something to do with the enl arged spleens, as the malaria victims in Kakamega did not have enla rged spleens. Not everyone was vomiting and thus we continued for several days, but the patients were beginning to st ay away. Finally I decided that I had to do something. I had each patien t take only 15 drop doses, but come back in four hours for a second dos e of 15 drops. This worked out OK. The 15 drop doses did not cause anyone to vomit and soon patients were again lining up outside for a treatment. So, once again minor problems had be en overcome. All these small things bring about the collection of information that is necessary to give proper instructions t o other people. Picture: Life Link Medical Center in Kampala U ganda.

Without the one of these food a cids the solution does very little good. The food acids act as an activ ator that makes the solution work. One must wait three minutes before adding anything else. After the three minute wait, one can th en add a 2 glass of juice to mask some of the taste. The juice must not have any added vitamin C. This is the reason for using fresh ju ice, because one can be sure that vitamin C has not been added. Almo st all bottled or canned juice has vitamin C added as a preservat ive. Although vitamin C is very good for you, in this case, vitamin C prevents the MMS from being effective in the body. So only use fresh juice. These food acids have a very important role. They causes the sodium chlorite solution to give up chlorine dioxide ions on a linear basis and it also protects the sodium chlorite from giving up too many ions at one time. This is important as one does not want th e entire amount of chlorine dioxide to be released as soon as th e solution reaches the stomach. The acetic acid or citric acid is necessary for the proper function of the solution in the body . Vinegar always contains acetic acid while lemons and limes c ontain citric acid. One of these acids is a necessary ing redient to the MMS. Solomon = s clinic is called A The Life Link Medical Centre @ and the address is PO Box 15081 Kampala Uganda, Phone 077 479017. He had a microscope and technicians who could determine the malaria parasite in the blood. During the time we were there w e treated at least 50 patients who checked positive for malari a before treatment and who tested negative after treatment. However , most of the 500+ patients that we treated didn = t care. They only wanted to feel better. And that was the result, they always felt bett er after they took the first and second doses. The fact is that at least 95% of them had malaria, we just did not have time to test everyone = s See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Uganda East Africa  Chapter 6  Page 5 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century blood. Still, we did have 50 verifications of patients who we re cleared of the malaria parasite. Shortly after I arrived at t he Life Link Medical Centre I met one special pastor from the DRC Congo. Hi s name was John Tumuhairwe. He was interested in the MMS and after he accepted a dose he immediately began to help us treat the people as they came in. He was very enthusiastic concerning t he MMS and he talked to me extensively about going to the DRC Congo, but, I didn = t have the money or other support to do so. He visited a number of places in Kampala and almost arranged it s o that I could visit the army in Northern Uganda where the fighting w as taking place. I was willing to go as there was widespread mala ria in the army and it would have been a significant contribution to settling the war. That would have been a very good advertisement for th e MMS at the time. But John was unable to get things completely arranged while I was there. Picture: Author gives Ev. John Tumuhariwe his first MMH for reoccurring malaria. Read John’s letter at the end of this chapter . When I left I gave him my last bottle of malaria solution (MMS) which was enough to treat about 180 people for malaria. If you read John = s recent letter to me you will see that he treated quite a few people in the Congo. Several months later I sent him 10 bottle s that See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Uganda East Africa  Chapter 6  Page 6 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century he used quite a bit. His letter also tells about using those 10 bottles. The picture shown here was taken as I first gave him a dose of MM S. He, like most of the people named in this book, can still be contacted. As of 10/10/2006 I have just sent him another 10 bo ttles as of. Over 2 of our patients with malaria were children. Some of these children would have died without the MMS doses. Although reactions were infrequent, it was in this clinic that we bega n to notice that the reactions were often similar. As time progressed we occasionally noticed the following reactions: (1) Dizzine ss. Some patients reported dizziness several hours after taking the doses. The dizziness never lasted over one hour. When the dizziness pas sed the other symptoms of malaria seemed to disappear at the same tim e. (2) Nausea. The nausea usually occurred within 10 to 15 minut es of taking the dose and seldom lasted more than 15 minutes. (3) Vomiting. On rare occasions someone vomited as a reaction to the dose, but not more than once. Picture: Author mixes MMS doses in the treatment room. (4) Tiredness. The tiredness was total and throughout the body. It was quite amazing as I experienced this one myself several years earlier when I first took the MMS to overcome some malaria I contracted in the jungle. One feels completely lethargic and has an inability to move. It is not really See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Uganda East Africa  Chapter 6  Page 7 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century unpleasant, just a weird sensation that = s slightly alarming. It lasts from 1 to 4 hours, no longer. (5) A combination of several or all of these reactions. This is rare, but it did hap pen once or twice. There is really nothing that needs to be done for any of the reactions. They all pass and have no lasting effects. Picture: Most children treated the MMS almost like they though it was a magical drink. These three did. This clinic here had at least six beds. There were several pat ients that recovered after taking the MMS. The doctor there was a bl ack man who had a great deal of compassion for children. He treate d them with kindness and appeared to be very concerned. He save d several lives while I was there simply by being able to diagno se correctly. He questioned me very thoroughly about the MMS. I ended up telling him about my friend who had used the A Stabilized Oxygen @ to inject the solution in the veins of his animals. And I mentioned that he had injected me a couple of times. In our discussions I finally told him that the strength of the solut ion that my friend used for injection into the animals was 15 drops in 20 m l of injection solution. See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Uganda East Africa  Chapter 6  Page 8 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century Toward the end of my stay there I noticed the doctor talking to groups of people who met him outside the clinic. After he talk ed to several groups I asked him about them. He said that the groups consisted of an advanced AIDS patient with his relatives. I d idn = t ask him what the conversation was about as it seemed that would be impolite. However, the day that I left he took me aside and sai d that he was going to treat some AIDS patients and that he would use a n injection. He said that he was connected to the very large Kam pala Hospital and that he would be able to approach AIDS patients t hat were being sent home to die. You may feel that I would feel conc ern at this point, but back in Las Vegas I had my friend inject me se veral times. We first used one drop, then several drops, and then a f ull dose two different times. There was never any adverse reacti on, but the injection did handle a very bad case of the flu. It wasn = t that I was worried about these AIDS patients; it was that I was extre mely sad that we couldn = t treat every AIDS patient that was being sent home plus those AIDS patients in the hospital. Again, the MMS releases chlorine dioxide into the body. Chlo rine dioxide is the most powerful killer of pathogens of all kinds known to man. There is no reason why it wouldn = t kill AIDS viruses. It does no damage to the human body in the low concentration used in th e MMS. When using direct injection into the blood you cannot us e vinegar. The fact is, the blood has the same neutral level as w ater, and thus it dilutes the MMS and causes the release of chlorine dioxide without vinegar over a period of a few hours without vinegar. At the time I did not encourage the doctor, nor did I discourag e him. I could not see that the injection would hurt these AIDS c ases and it would probably help. After I returned home I kept in clo se contact with this doctor as he treated 390 AIDS patients over a period of 8 months. They were patients that had been sent home See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Uganda East Africa  Chapter 6  Page 9 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century from the local Kampala Hospital assuming that they would die soon. His emails showed that 6 out of 10 AIDS cases were feeling good and anxious to go back to work or back to their lives within thr ee days. The other 40% recovered within 30 days. None of the case s that he was able to keep track of had a relapse. Two out of the 39 0 cases died. The ones that were well in 3 days needed time to recover, but it seemed that they were only recovering from an extreme case of weakness. Unfortunately, this doctor = s name is one name that I must keep confidential. But, you can see that he ha d very good results, as all of these patients were slated to die within weeks of being released from the Kampala hospital. I did not find it hard to believe his reports as he had no reason to lie to me on a constant basis day after day as I was paying him nothi ng nor even sending him free MMS. I have been able to treat a numbe r of AIDS patients successfully myself. And my friend in Malaw i, who runs a business there, has been treating several employees w ho were too sick from AIDS infection to come to work. They are now all back to work. The owner of the clinic was also the pastor of a local church. H is church was a member of the FCF Int. Missionary group to Africa . It turned out that he had a problem very similar to the other Past or in Kenya. Solomon Mwsegi was also taking pain tablets for the pa in caused by malaria. Both he and his wife were avoiding the idea that they had malaria. The pain tablets will often mask the ma laria, not very well but they keep you going. To go on taking them is extremely dangerous as the malaria can kill you without you m uch feeling it. Actually when I asked him about it, he said, A I know its malaria, I = ve just been putting off doing anything about it. @ He said, A I = ll take a double dose right now. @ I replied by asking if he was sure, and I mentioned that it was going to make him nauseous. He said, A I See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Uganda East Africa  Chapter 6  Page 10 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century know it is, but I want to get it over and I want to be sure the mala ria is killed. @ He had been watching carefully what we were doing and how I was re-adjusting the number of drops. So he took the doub le dose (of course, with the vinegar activator and the standard three minute wait.) He later told me that he wanted the drops to make him sick as he felt that would be proof that something was real ly working in his body. Here is word for word what I wrote in my notes at the time: A Within 20 minutes he was nauseous. Within an hour he could not drive the car. He had diarrhea. At home he felt totally tired like he didn = t want to move except to go to the toilet. It started at about 11 A M that morning and at 4 PM when we got home he was better. At 8 PM he was up lying of the couch. He said all sickness was gone, b ut he was feeling weak. The next morning he was slightly dizzy bu t feeling good otherwise. @ From the beginning to the end of this ordeal, he was very enthusiastic about it. When he got sick, h e was enthusiastic because he believed the MMS was working. When i t was over, the next day he said he couldn = t believe how well he was feeling. His wife was watching the whole ordeal and she was very worrie d, but she was also afraid of doing nothing because she was well aware that her pain tablets were also masking malaria. When s he proceeded to take the dose, her husband (Solomon) stayed wit h her. She was not as nauseous as Solomon had been, but she stayed sick for most of the second day. Finally, however, she was extremely happy about how well that she was feeling. She said it was the first day in over a year that she felt like herself. Evi dently, when malaria is masked with pain tablets, it gets very bad and thus the MMS was extra reactive. However, they could have avoided the reaction simply by taking a few days using smaller doses i nstead of trying to do it all at once. The problem was that they were See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Uganda East Africa  Chapter 6  Page 11 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century always extremely busy and didn = t feel that they could afford the extra time. It didn = t seem to matter who I was involved with while I was in Africa; the people were willing to trust me. I think that they could feel or that they knew that I would not do anything that was aga inst their better interests. The time spent at Solomon = s clinic was very productive in learning more of the ins and outs of the MMS. My driver, Peter Mwangi drove to Kampala and arrived a day later than me. Solomon also furnished him a room in his house. Peter was a great help in the clinic. He helped me mix MMS doses. He took pictures, and he learned as much data as he could a bout the MMS. Several months later, Solomon accused Peter of raping one of his servant girls. The girl was pregnant. Peter said that it was impossible. He didn = t do any such thing. It seems like, since I was in the same house, that I would have heard some kind of noise, o r would have noticed the girl crying or something. But I did not hear anything. I observed only a very high integrity from Peter wh ile I was there, so I rather believe Peter when he says that he didn = t do it. The thing that seemed kind of peculiar to me was that Solomon continued to fire person after person from his clinic even wh ile I was there. I worked with the people that he fired and they all seem ed to be doing a good job. I never understood why he fired any of them , so when he stated that Peter had raped his servant girl, I ques tion that accusation in my own mind, but I did not interfere with Solomon’s operation of the clinic. In any case, we treated over 500 people while I was there. Solomon asked me to help and to remain present because those people who came were expecting a white man. The people there had a great deal more confidence in the MMS because a white man was treating them. Even when I quit giving the solution to peo ple, they were much more confident when I was simply present.

I sent emails to the president of the U.S., to Bill Gates, to various people who did humanitarian things, to all of the TV shows that did humanitarian things, such as Oprah. I continued to send o ut free bottles of MMS as well as I sold the 4 ounce bottles with 325 dos es for $20 each or for $5 to anyone living in town. Later when I doubled the strength, I sold the 4 ounce bottles with 650 dose s for the same price. As time passed and people talked to me about various problems I continued to find new uses for the MMS. All of my life I have had trouble with my teeth. Most of my teeth were missing and I wore dentures. My gums were quite soft and my teeth were somewhat loose in the gums. They often got sore and at that particular t ime they started to hurt and I thought I would have to have one or tw o pulled. Then I finally decided that I should brush my teeth wi th the MMS. I used 6 drops of MMS and 2 teaspoon of vinegar swirled together in a glass and then I waited the 3 minutes and added 1/ 3 glass of water and used that to brush my teeth. Again I was amaz ed. All of the infection and soreness disappeared in hours. With in a week my gums had hardened up. When I finally did go to have a tooth pulled, it took the dentist a full hour to pull the tooth. My gu ms were so tough, and the tooth was so well imbedded into my jaw bone he simply couldn = t just grab it with his pliers and pull. It wouldn = t come out. I = m not sure I should have had it pulled. It looked perfectly healthy when it was finally out. The dentist was more surpris ed than I was.

I am sure Arnold was working hard to get the money for our next t rip to Africa. My contention was always that if he would provide m e with enough money for a round trip airplane ticket and some li ving expenses then I would travel anywhere and talk to the various government agencies and hospitals until I find some place to do clinical trials. Arnold = s contention was that we could not go anywhere in Africa until we had an invitation. According to Arnold the re was always plenty of money but his insistence that we needed an invitation kept us immobile for years. Peter Mwangi secured an invitation from one hospital in Kenya to go do clinical trial s in Kenya. Remember, Peter was my driver in Kenya and Uganda who I traine d in dispensing the MMS. We could have done the clinical trials of 100 malaria patients with before and after blood tests for less t han $20,000 including my travel expenses. The money was availab le, but Arnold would not allow me to go to Kenya. Instead he wanted to help Floyd Hammer and his wife who had various projects going on in Tanzania but who could not get clinica trials for months an d it finally proved out that he never did get clinical trials. Cli nical trials was what we wanted at the time, and we could have had it through Peter, but we were going to do it Arnold’s way regardless of th e results. Time after time for over a year, Floyd Hammer was provided mon ey from our Malaria Solution Foundation and he never gave us any information back as to its use. We helped them buy a pickup tru ck, and ship a large container food supplies to Tanzania, and whe n Floyd wrote a report to his people in the U.S. he never acknowl edged that we helped at all. He talked about treating malaria patie nts, but he never acknowledged that he was using the MMS to treat the pati ents. Finally Arnold just said that he wasn = t going to send them any more money. But if I could have had that same money, I would have completed the clinical trials in Kenya and would have had the proof that everyone was asking for. See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Continuing Story of the MMS Chap ter 7  page 3 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century The other thing that I tried to get Arnold to do was simply hire Peter Mwangi, my driver who was proficient with the dispensation, to continue treating and passing out the MMS. He was traveling t o hospitals, some of which were willing to try the MMS. He could have been traveling to churches, orphanages, hospitals, and cli nics. They trusted him and many were willing to use the solution. In the s ame amount of time that we fooled around with Floyd, Peter would h ave treated thousands of people being treated and dozens of plac es would have used the MMS. Unfortunately, nothing I suggested was considered. Hiring Peter, a local instead of someone from th e U.S., would have been ridiculously cheap. We would not have had to p ay for his airplane ticket, he would have worked for less than $1 00 a month. We would have had to pay for gasoline, some operating expenses, and have shipped him plenty of MMS. His expenses we re 1/10 that of a foreigner or missionary. He would have gotten d one exactly what we wanted to do. Arnold didn = t trust Peter, but he never met him and I worked with him for an entire month every day. We were good friends by the time I left. On the other hand, Floyd t ook our money, which was thousands and didn = t even say thanks. The money we paid Floyd got absolutely nothing done so far as we co uld tell. Arnold kept making mistake after mistake while all the time s aying that everything had to be done his way. He hired the kid who fin ally made such trouble for us he prevented us from getting a legal nonprofit Malaria Solution Foundation. Arnold hired sever al people to create our Web Site and when they had worked almost a year on it, it was still a very poor site. Then he hired another man to d o our site, paid him up front and never got a thing for his money all t he while our site never got done. It has been six years since Arno ld said he was going to get us a web site set up and as I write these lines we still don = t have one. He sent thousands of dollars to Floyd Hammer and we never received any acknowledgment or data concerning the Malaria patients treated with our MMS. With the money Arnold continued to lose, I could have had a number of clinical trial s completed in Kenya with the proof that we needed to show other s.

He continued to c laim that the people who were going to sponsor us would only do so if he was in total control. Arnold actually prevented the MMS from being used distributed while all the time proclaiming to be getting it done. Arnold continued to tell me that although I was on the board of the Malaria Solution Foundation it was going to be operated like a corporation. Basically, he said that he was the president an d things were going to happen the way he specified. Arnold and John continued to say that I had no say in the way things were being r un. There was no arguing with either one of them. If there was any discussion about the events of the past weeks or past year, th ey would both get together and tell me my memory was wrong. When there was any discussion and I tried to say something they wou ld just start shouting. I could not get any ideas across. Everything went quietly so long as I kept my mouth shut. I could have left, and I should have, but there was always the promise that they would have the money to get to Africa to prove out the MMS so that the world would accept it. I kept my mouth shut because that promise alw ays hung there in front of me. To be completely fair, when I finall y returned from Africa the last time, Arnold called me with sev eral questions concerning how to do things. He stated he wanted my input, but as things continued he would do things as he wanted regardless of my input. Up to this point, Arnold had been the o nly game in town for me. Then I realized I could write this book. I made a contract with the World Health Organizatio n (WHO). Before my trip to Kenya and Uganda I had written quite a few let ters to the World Health Organization which, evidently didn = t want to appear like they were not interested. They returned one of my letters saying that they had a program in which they tested various dr ugs that might have some effect on malaria. They were interested in the MMS, they wrote. After some discussion they sent me a contrac t to sign. We negotiated a bit, changed some points, and I finally signed their contract. I sent them a bottle of the MMS. About a year an d a half later, after I returned from Africa, I finally got a lett er from them See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Continuing Story of the MMS Chap ter 7  page 5 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century stating that they were testing my solution in a separate lab. They had contracted with a doctor to do the testing for them. I was enth used to learn that the doctor was actually of doing the testing. But h e tested it on mice and reported it simply didn = t work. I was amazed, but he reported that it wouldn = t cure mice, or even improve their condition. There was nothing more I could say as I wasn = t present when the testing was done. So at that time 35,000 human field patients were back to health, but it wouldn = t cure a mouse? Sorry, but I don = t believe him. There is a country in Africa that won = t even allow WHO to come across its borders. It seems to me that WHO, if they were reall y interested in helping the world as they claim to be, would hav e at least given the MMS a comprehensive test. That = s especially true after they were informed of the successes in Kenya and Uganda. At th at time over 35,000 people had been successfully treated in the field, based on reports said that everyone went away feeling good. I also informed the doctor of our field work, but he was not interest ed. Had they been even slightly interested they would have invited m e over to help them with the testing. The doctor doing the testing didn = t have the slightest idea what the MMS is about. He didn = t understand it. He didn = t understand the vinegar activation and he didn = t understand what the chemicals were. He didn = t want to know. He preferred to use my solution without knowing what it was. My evaluation of his disinterest is that he just wanted to prove it didn = t work and that was that. Let me say it again, he was absolutely totally disinter ested in the fact that 35,000 malaria patients had been successfully tre ated in the field. I talked to him at length on the phone, but again, he sho wed total disinterest. Obviously, all WHO wanted was a doctor = s signature that said that the MMS didn = t work. There was also a doctor in Israel who also tested MMS, and said it wouldn’t work. But guess what, he refused to use vinegar to ac tivate the MMS. He said that acetate was the same thing and he used onl y acetate. Well the fact is, acetate is not the same thing as vin egar. Chemically it’s totally different, but he simply would not u se vinegar as he obviously believed he knew best.

He s aid that I could not give any more away. We went through that same thing from time to time. He wanted us to keep control of every bottle. I am sure, from Arnold = s point of view, he believes that he was the man who got everything in Africa going. He continued to me et people and groups that just might finance us to go to Africa. I continue to live out here on the desert and Arnold continued t o not allow me to meet any of the people who might finance us in Afric a. I wrote this paragraph today simply because I gave two local pe ople one bottle of MMS each and Arnold found out and there was a long discussion about how I might go to jail because of it. Today I j ust got a call from Arnold as he was leaving San Francisco after talki ng to one more prospective donor. Another one he would n ot let me meet. Out here in the desert, only writing emails to Africa, I was ab le to get over 5,000 people treated and cured of malaria since March of 2004 by making friends in Africa. Arnold had done nothing during t his time except talk about what he is going to do in Africa. Nothin g had happened. According to him, he had unlimited money (at least in the millions) to handle Africa and I had just my Social Security check. One day in the desert, about one year after coming back from Uganda, while working on the roof I fell off and broke my neck. I was rushed to the hospital in the nearby city, but they didn = t have the necessary equipment so they flew me by airplane to Reno. Fina lly, they opened my neck up and put a titanium screw into the 2nd cervical in my neck (the same bone that the actor who played Superman broke). You should see the screw. It looks like a 1-1 /2 inch wood screw. I also broke my back at the same time. My back healed quite quickly, but my neck refused to heal. The doctor left the bones not quite touching. The screw should have had another 2 turn. Six months went by and still no healing. The doctor was insisting that he open my neck back up and put two more screws i n place. The Veterans Hospital said that I must have another op eration as well, but they had another idea of how to do it. However, the y couldn = t get to it for another six months. I was left between a rock and a hard place or a broken neck.

In my search of the Internet I found a group of clin ics that were using a new theory of magnetism and that the clinics were having really great results. The cost was very high. After ge tting as much evidence of the new technology and as much data on the old technology as I could find I bought some of the strongest magn ets now available. In fact, they are so strong that they are dange rous. They can squash a finger or cut it off when being handled improperly. The new technology works on the basic concept th at magnetism must have a completed magnetic circuit through th e body in order to get maximum healing power. During this time I continued to communicate with as many peop le in Africa as I could, plus sending emails to various organizati ons. With the magnets I bought I constructed a steel curved piece that w ould allow for a completed magnetic circuit through my neck with t he South Pole nearest the broken bone. I put the magnets in place for a total of five days and nights sitting up all night to make sure they were exactly in place. At the end of five days my neck began to swell up. I went back to the doctor and had another x-ray. The bone was completely healed. The doctor removed my neck brace. He said that I didn = t need it any more. He said he was glad that he decided to wait before giving me the operation. He didn = t remember that I was using magnets. He didn = t care and he wasn = t interested. In fact, he would have preferred to give me the operation. He didn = t decide to wait before giving me the operation. I didn = t get the operation, because I refused it. If he had his way, I would have had the operation. I don = t know what all the magnetic circuit does, but I do know that the extremely strong magnets cause the area to swell with blo od and turn red. No doubt the extra blood aids in the healing. The x-r ays before and after proved that the bones healed in the five days that I kept the magnets in place. I was mainly relieved that if the opportunity came to return to Africa, my neck was healed and I could go.

As time passed a man from Guinea called and wanted us to go to that country and treat the people there. He said that he was a f riend of the first lady and that he could get us approved by the government. He had told the first lady about us and they were anxious for us to come to Guinea. Arnold finally took me to mee t him and we talked. Things were being set for us to go. I called t his man from Guinea and then all hell broke loose as Arnold told me that I was never to talk to this man again. He would never allow me to talk to anyone that he considered his contact. There was the h ollering and screaming that I so hate and cannot take part in. As things turned out, this man decided he was going to dictate the terms of our every move in Guinea and it was simply something that we could not accept. At least that is what Arnold told me. So we didn = t go to Guinea. I can = t tell you how humiliating it is to be told that you can = t even talk to someone. The date at this time was the first part o f 2005. Chino goes to Sierra Leone West Africa A very active young fellow by the name of Chino contacted me an d stated that he would like to know more about the MMS (We were calling it the Malaria Solution at that time). I met Chino in B eatty, Nevada about March 2005. I explained how the MMS worked and mixed some doses and had him take a dose. Chino explained that his family in Sierra Leone owned a large gold mining concession along the main river there. He explained t hat the malaria was so bad that everyone in his family had malaria and many people there had died of malaria. He said that he needed as muc h of the MMS as I could furnish him. I said I would try to get him as mu ch as possible. We had decided to charge a price that any African could afford at that time, which was about 10 cents. I explained the price See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Continuing Story of the MMS Chap ter 7  page 10 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century and he said that he could get the money. I furnished him with 20 bottles at that time which could treat 450 persons a bottle. I gave them to him free of charge, but he insisted that he would pay in the near future. About two months later he visited me in the desert. He had been to Sierra Leone and treated about 1,000 people in the village an d area where his family lived. He said that more people were there wa iting for him to bring more bottles of the MMS. He explained that it w as not possible to charge anything for the doses that he gave the people. He said that the minute he began selling doses for any amount o f money, the government would come and take the money and the MMS. That = s the way it is in East Africa. The government wants all the money and all the business. If you give the doses away, the re is no money in it and the government is not interested. The only w ay to make it work is bring it into the country and give it away without charge. Picture: Chino’s relatives in Sierra Leone help him treat hundreds of people.

His assessment of the si tuation was that to furnish it for freely was the only way that the peop le of Sierra Leone would ever get the MMS. But, he said that he had people in the U.S. who would furnish the money. I didn = t ask him for money even though he kept saying that he would pay. Picture: People line up to take a dose of MMS in Sierra Leone. Notice how closely they stand to one another. This was Chino’s operation. I put together 100 bottles with 450 does each. Then Chino and I traveled to Reno and shipped the bottles to Sierra Leone. He p aid for the shipping with a credit card. I asked for no money, only that he give us a signed letter from each person that was treated an d cured who had malaria. He then left to go back to Sierra Leone t o begin treating more people. He later returned from Sierra Le one after treating an additional 5,000 malaria victims. This tr ip took about three months. He had a camera and his cousin took a numbe r of pictures of the people during the process. When he returne d he did not have any letters signed, but he did have the pictures.

They relied o n my desire to see the people of Africa cured. Thus they could take my technology, allow me no say at all, and pay me nothing but expe nses for the trip, which of course, was really nothing. They assur ed the sponsors that no one (me) would be receiving payment for the technology. They said that the sponsors wanted all of their m oney to go toward treating people in Africa. I couldn = t really argue against that. How could I be so selfish as to want some return for my technology? The fact is though, I never knew who the A sponsors @ were. I finally realized that although they were ensuring that the money went towards treating people in Africa, they were also using my technology to become known in the country of Malawi.

They had alre ady insured that I had no say. It had been told to me again and again . John just had to get this one last dig in for no apparent reason so far as I could see. There were many things that were not going to work Arnold = s way, but he would have to see it for himself as we went alon g. He certainly wasn = t going to listen to me. I wanted to walk out on the whole thing. It = s not a way I enjoy being treated, but we were slated to be treating sick peo ple in Malawi and I just couldn = t walk out. (The fact is, if I had walked out the m ission would have failed). Yes, it was John = s money that was making it possible, but it was also my years of work pushing the idea and my t echnology that also made it possible. I had no idea that they conside red me a loose cannon, as I had agreed to their demands. When I r eturned a little over a month later John apologized because his girlfrien d said he should, but that didn = t really change anything. Money people have a tend ency to not respect people without money. Money, however, was never my thing. I spent 50 years and hundreds of thousands of dollars studying spiritual philosophies and religions. I have somet hing John and Arnold will never have and will never understand. My spir itual studies had enabled me to be sufficiently receptive to new poss ibilities so I could discover the MMS in the first place. Zahir Sheikh (see picture) was the businessman who invited us to Malawi. He is an East Indian whose ancestors moved to Malawi many years ago. He took us all around the capitol of Ma lawi to many government offices helping us get approval for the MMS (which we called at that time the Malaria Solution). Our suc cess in getting the MMS accepted in Malawi was completely orchestrated by Zahir. Every day he would take us around the city, in his automo bile, to visit various officials, such as the Chief of Police, the Inspect or General, the Health Minister, and so on."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Malawi East Africa  Ch apter 8  Page 3 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century See Page 15 of this Chapter for data on obtaining M MS. When we visited the office of each official, Zahir would introduce us, Arnold would talk about our mission to bring the MM S to Africa, and then he would suggest that I tell them the details of how the MMS really works. At that time I would spend 10 to 20 minutes explaining the basic chemistry of the MMS. The time I took was mostly d etermined by how many questions that they asked. I thought this was particularly interesting because before we left on the trip, Arn old was extremely adamant that we should not tell anyone in Malawi ab out how the solution worked. That was one of the reasons they called me a loose cannon. I tried to point out that our program it w ould not be workable if we didn = t tell people how the MMS worked. That was one of the main points of contention. Picture: Three of the prison nurses watch as the A uthor shows them how to mix the MMS. I was forbidden to tell them how it worked, and to the very first person we went to see, Arnold said, A This is the inventor and he will tell you how it works. @ So for months Arnold was stuck on not explaining how it works. But when we were actually there, Arnold imm ediately saw that "},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Malawi East Africa  Ch apter 8  Page 4 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century See Page 15 of this Chapter for data on obtaining M MS. we would have to tell them the details. This was on e of the many examples that was used to show me that Arnold must have complete control. I didn = t really push the point, because I knew that the do ctors and the scientifically trained officials would never allow us to do anything without an explanation of how it worked. At one po int Arnold even said to me, “If you start telling them how it works , I will take you down to the airplane and send you home.” (That was when we were talking about going to Guinea). Another point of disagreement was Arnold = s insistence that we should not be the ones to administer the MMS, that we sho uld only train the people there and then let them give the MMS to the malaria patients. But that simply wasn = t practical. I didn’t push that point either as I knew Arnold would have to change when he got there. Whe n you bring a medicine, you had better be prepared to give it to the people. If you don = t, no one will trust you, and they will have no tru st in your medicine. As it turned out, we always gave the dos es. Arnold was smart enough to see that it had to be that way. To hand the medicine to a local and say, “Here you give it” just doesn’t wo rk in Africa. They conclude you are afraid to give your own medicine. So as the inventor, when we arrived at different pl aces, I made sure we gave the doses and Arnold quickly saw the advantage . When we went to see an official I generally would mix doses for everyone, including the officials, and believe it or not, every official we saw was willing to drink a dose. So the very first thing we did in Malawi was to personally give people their doses of the MMS. Then when we finall y got out to the prisons or other places, again we were the ones to dispense the doses. In the entire time we were there, I do not believe that we had a single Malawian dispense the doses. Basically, everything went the way I said it would go, but there was no recognition of that. Rather there was just increased determination for everything to go the w ay Arnold dictated. Things do change rapidly there. When they see that you are willing to give the medicine and that it works, then they begi n to ask to be allowed"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Malawi East Africa  Ch apter 8  Page 5 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century See Page 15 of this Chapter for data on obtaining M MS. to handle the medicine and the situation. One must not show in any way that he is hesitant about dispensing the medici ne. While we were in Malawi, Arnold fired the two other people that he brought with us. One was a photographer named James Hackbarth and the other, a friend of Arnold = s, named John Wyaux. I won = t tell all the details, just the highlights. The most embarrassin g part happened in probably the most exclusive restaurant in town. Eve ryone had on suits and ties and we were the only white people there. Arnold stood up and shouted at John Wyaux. I never really knew why. T he whole restaurant went deathly silent when Arnold began to shout. I just sat there looking at my plate, too embarrassed to look up. Finally being so angry, Arnold stomped out of the restaurant, and th ings settled back down to the normal murmur of conversation. I found out the next day that John had said something to Zahir, our business man helper, but Zahir never heard what was said. And I didn = t hear what was said. In fact, no one but Arnold heard what was said, not ev en John knew what he had said that set Arnold off. To this day, I do n = t know what John said, thus I still have no idea why he was fired. Three evenings later Arnold was slightly under the influence of alcohol. He entered James Hackbarth = s room and fired him because he wasn = t taking the right type of pictures, according to Arn old. I admit, I didn = t like some of his pictures, but I figured all we had to do was explain exactly what we wanted. In any case after that, Ar nold told both of them that they could get home the best they could. During the few days that they had left, Arnold was extremely rude to th em anytime he saw them. Perhaps I should have gone home with them, a s no one deserves that kind of treatment, but I wanted the Malawi pro ject to succeed so badly that I was able to compromise my integrity co ncerning the treatment of my acquaintances. All of my decisions and choices were then, and still are predicated, on the idea that I want the MMS to be in use widely throughout the world.

We had the same problem in Malawi that we had in Ke nya. The initial doses that I mixed were too weak. When we were fir st treating prisoners in our clinical trials at the prison, they were com ing back the next day, feeling better but not totally cured. So, I began i ncreasing the doses. There was one other problem. We were purchasing ju ice that had vitamin C added as a preservative. The added vitam in C reduces the effectiveness of the MMS by about 75%. I had alrea dy proven this fact, but I let it slip by me at first as I had never had a real problem with it before. Once I realized that vitamin C was present in the purchased juice, I started using only fresh juice, and also i ncreased the dosage. Then we began to get a 100% recovery rate from mala ria. Picture: Two female prison inmates give their babies the MMS formula. Both babies were okay in 24 hours. Someone had suggested that doing clinical trials in the local prisons would be the easiest thing to do and the easiest pl ace to get permission. We decided to give it a try. We visited the local prison by the name of Maula in the city of Lilongwe, which is the capital of Malawi. The manager of the prison gave us permission to talk to the medical technician. The assistant medical technician = s name was S.S. Kamanja. Although he was the assistant, he was always the o nly one there. He arranged for us to do the clinical trials. We slip ped him a few dollars at several different times and he was quite cooperativ e. Actually, it is only fair to mention that he was quite cooperative even before we slipped him a few dollars, but he was such a nice man that we thought it would be nice to help him out a bit. "},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Malawi East Africa  Ch apter 8  Page 7 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century See Page 15 of this Chapter for data on obtaining M MS. We then left the prison to find a lab or hospital t hat would be able to process blood samples. It was especially important that they be a separate organization. We finally settled on a med ical hospital called MARS which was an international organization. MARS stands for Medical Air Rescue Service. Dr. Joseph Aryee was t he head man there and he was very responsive to us. We explained wha t we wanted to do and what our MMS actually did. We mixed our normal drink to show him. He went ahead and drank the mixture as did mo st other officials in Malawi. He assigned us a medical lab technician whose name was Paul Makaula. Dr. Aryee said that all we would nee d to do would be to pay Paul = s salary while he was working for us. We agreed on $300 U.S. for six days, plus we agreed to pay his gasoline an d other expenses. Dr. Aryee allowed the medical lab technician to use the MARS lab and microscope for the blood tests from at the prison a t no charge, which we thought was very generous. He wanted to be of some help. Throughout the country of Malawi the officials all drank a full dose of the MMS. If it had been a drug, they probably woul d not have taken it. If they were not willing to take the MMS, which is merely a mineral supplement, then they would not be willing to have their people take it. In my opinion, these officials were very courageous to assist us to help their people. They were willing to take the doses o f MMS just on our say so. It is my belief that the reason the Pharmaceutical, Medicines and Poisons Board so readily accepted our MMS as a mine ral supplement rather than a drug was that so many officials drank it without hesitation when we told them that it was not a drug. In essenc e many people really wanted to see the MMS help their country. They want ed it to work and they were willing to cooperate in order to have it work for them. Back at the prison the next morning, S.S. Kamanja b rought in the first 10 men. They were given six drops each, with ¼ tea spoon of vinegar, the three minute wait, and then pineapple juice was then added. Arnold checked each patient for temperature. The first th ing we learned was that those ear thermometers simply do not work in A frica. I think it is because ears in Africa, especially in prison, are c leaned differently, or"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Malawi East Africa  Ch apter 8  Page 8 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century See Page 15 of this Chapter for data on obtaining M MS. not at all. Luckily we had the plastic strip therm ometers that you just press on the forehead. Within about 10 seconds the temperature can be read in the plastic. Finally Arnold was using the strip thermometers on everyone he checked. The strip thermometer worked well and we were able to get the temperature of each patient which w as generally quite high. Paul, the lab technician, stuck each patient = s finger and took a blood sample and put it on a slide with the patient = s name. These slides were then taken back to the MARS laboratory and Pau l checked each one on the microscope. We carefully recorded the d ata from the 10 patients that morning after taking the blood sample s. Then I mixed the doses in plastic cups and Arnold handed the cup to each patient. When we had finished taking blood samples, recordin g the data, and after giving each of the 10 patients a dose we aske d if there were any more prisoners complaining of malaria. Kamanja sai d that there were 19 more. We said, “Bring them all in and we will d ose all of them,” which is what we did. We returned that afternoon a fter 3:00 p.m. to see the results but they were not so great. Most sai d they were feeling better, but they all still had fevers. The fever ha d been reduced in only one man. I knew something was wrong. We dosed ever yone again including the 10 actually being tested and the othe r 19 that were just receiving a dose without taking blood samples or ha ving records kept. We again used only six drops. You probably guessed it, the next morning everyone still tested positive for malaria. It was then I began to remember that i n Kenya I had been using 15 drops. We only used six drops in the U.S. for maintenance. I began to get an inkling of what was going wrong. I also remembered the experiments proving that vitamin C reduced the effectiveness of the chlorine dioxide. I began working that evening at getting the correct juice without vitamin C added."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Malawi East Africa  Ch apter 8  Page 9 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century See Page 15 of this Chapter for data on obtaining M MS. The Malawi prisons are much like concentration camp s. The prison is closed in by with only a wire fence with barbed wir e at the top. There are armed guards at the corners of the prison in sm all guard shacks. While we were there, they asked us if we would like to see the women = s quarters and of course we said yes. The women slee p on the bare floor with only a blanket or two. Arnold said that he wo uld get the women a foam mattress to sleep on. Women who have children have the children stay with them in the prison. The guards get most of the food slated for the prison and sell it elsewhere. There fore, the inmates have very little to eat. They do raise a few vegetables like potatoes. There is a single toilet for the entire women = s dorm with water continuously running down the toilet. Aside from the bare floor s, the prison stays fairly clean. The women bathe outside under a wate r faucet out of the sight of the men. Picture: Shows 5 pads where the female inmates sleep. Children also stay here with their mothers. There was one man in the prison that had a high fev er, but his blood test came back negative (meaning no malaria present ). Since he seemed to have malaria symptoms, we suspected he ma y have been faking it. However, when we gave him the MMS, his temperature came down to normal overnight and his symptoms disappear ed. Paul, the lab man, said that he checked the blood a second time, but no malaria parasites were present. In any case, he got well e ven if it wasn = t malaria. There was also one prisoner who refused treatment. But since he was there, we recorded his name and temperature anyway. Several days later, when he saw all of the other prisoners getti ng well and he was still "},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Malawi East Africa  Ch apter 8  Page 10 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century See Page 15 of this Chapter for data on obtaining M MS. sick, he decided that he wanted to be treated also. So, we went ahead and dosed him and he was okay the next day. I finally realized that the pineapple juice from th e grocery store had vitamin C as a preservative. As I mentioned before , Vitamin C prevents the MMS from generating the chlorine dioxide that i s necessary. We bought pineapples and a juice maker and made our ow n juice. In addition to using fresh juice we increased the dose to 18 drops. The next morning, before using the 18 drop doses, we ag ain checked the patients. Of the 10 from which we had originally t aken blood samples, the one man that did not test positive for malaria was feeling okay. The other nine again said that they were feeling better , but not well. A second blood test was done. This test showed that the malaria parasites were still present but the parasites looked distort ed in several cases. We then dosed everyone with 18 drops and used the fres h pineapple juice. We also dispensed the same 18-drop dose to the 19 additional prisoners with malaria. The blood tests that our lab man took the next morn ing all came back negative and all patients reported they were feelin g good. The other 19 also reported feeling good, as well. We then selec ted another 10 cases to check and we had Paul, the lab man, take their b lood. We treated them with 18 drops of MMS and used the fresh pineap ple juice in their doses. Arnold was very helpful and assisted in eve rything. He handed out the doses to the patients and took their temper atures while I while I mixed the doses and recorded the information. The next morning (24 hours later) their blood all tested negative for ma laria. In addition, all of the “old” patients that we treated in the prison we re still feeling well. I had learned in Uganda that the sure way to comple tely destroy the malaria parasite was to use two doses of 15 drops e ach, separated by one to four hours. If that had been the way we had started out, there would never have been any trouble here. I have to plead being old with a poor memory. Two years had passed since the trea tments in Uganda. I simply had forgotten the details and had to lear n them over again. In the U.S. we usually just use six drop doses for mai ntenance, but we often need to go above six drops to cure some disea ses. I had forgotten"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Malawi East Africa  Ch apter 8  Page 11 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century See Page 15 of this Chapter for data on obtaining M MS. that we were doing two 15 drop doses in Uganda. I = ll never make that mistake again, and hopefully someone smarter than m e will be doing it next time anyway. At the end of the prison tests, Dr.Aryee at the MAR S hospital reviewed Paul = s lab blood tests and gave us a very positive lette r. The fact was, that every patient that originally tested positive for malaria in the blood tested negative after MMS treatment and they were f eeling fine. It took several extra doses for the first 10 tested, but al l eventually tested negative. Let me say that again, all eventually te sted negative, which made it 100% successful even if it did take an extr a day to get the first group cured. While in Malawi we also visited several grass hut v illages. There we treated every kind of sickness you can imagine. We dosed the villagers as they came up to us telling us what was wrong. W e didn = t refuse a dose to anyone. Why not treat as many as we could, it = s only a mineral supplement. Most of the people in the village have one disease or another. Their water is not pure. The warm weathe r encourages all kinds of diseases. They walk with bare feet and th e grass and streams have diseases that enter through the skin. The nex t day when we returned to the village, most of the illness had be en overcome. A number of people had vomited worms and some had dea d worms in their stools. In the future, we hope to go back wi th enough solution so all of the villages can have what they need. Let me mention at this point that after Arnold fire d the two people he had brought, he was very active in getting things d one. He made things happen. I was pretty much just along for the ride at that point. I had no say in how things were done. Arnold dictated every thing and he made it work. So I helped at the prison and made sugges tions to Arnold. I carried the technical side of things. But Arnold c ontrolled all phases of the operation. I really didn = t need to be there except to figure out why the solution hadn’t initially worked and then make the necessary adjustments. The fact is, Arnold made the whole op eration work and it was successful. "},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Malawi East Africa  Ch apter 8  Page 12 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century See Page 15 of this Chapter for data on obtaining M MS. Arnold asked me once, A How would you have done it differently? @ Well, I would have done many things differently, si mply because no two people do things the same way. But, had he asked m e if I disagreed with how he did things ...... well, I felt that the re was no point in nitpicking. I would not have disagreed with anythi ng except with the way he fired the two guys who he brought along on t he trip and the fact that he tried to keep such complete control of the bottles of MMS solution. At one of the villages I wanted to leave a bottle with the chief, but Arnold insisted that we would come back the nex t day to treat those who needed a second dose. But we never got back, a lthough I suggested it several times. Thus many went untreat ed, and in any sort of a situation where we didn = t keep our commitment it was upsetting to me. I hope you understand my purpose. I don = t just want to help some people in some villages. That is great to do and w e enjoyed it, but my real purpose is to first prove out the MMS to the p oint that the world becomes willing to use it to help destroy many dise ases in Africa including malaria and AIDS. When that happens, the world will need to spend less and less money on Africa. Right now, th e world sends untold billions of dollars in Africa. Malaria alone is th e biggest cause of poverty in Africa. Each year 500,000,000 people are sick w ith malaria and can = t work, and millions more have AIDS and other disease s. It also takes millions of other people to care for the sick. Eve rywhere you go in Africa you see nonprofit humanitarian groups workin g to help the people there. Billions and billions of dollars are being spent in an effort to help Africa, but still it isn = t enough. This money will not be needed when these diseases are under control or even eradi cated. Those billions of dollars can be allocated to other purpo ses. We accomplished a lot in Malawi. We got several ag encies of the government to accept our MMS as a mineral supplemen t, which was important, but we treated less than 100 people whil e there. After we got the government acceptance and did a couple of 10-pa tient clinical trials, we went home. In actuality we did a total of thre e clinical trials. Finally, six months later we also found out that th e clinical trials"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Malawi East Africa  Ch apter 8  Page 13 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century See Page 15 of this Chapter for data on obtaining M MS. conducted by the Malaria Board of the government re sulted in the same 100% recovery from malaria that our tests proved in the prison. There is the promise to treat the entire country, a nd I hope we do. Arnold did a very good job. He kept at it until we had our data. We, however, did not come close to doing what we had co me to do. We were going to spend a great deal of time in the vil lages training the chiefs and others to use the MMS. We only went to three villages in all. We did not train anyone in a single village to use the MMS. That was really what we were there for. We left, I assume b ecause we were out of money, but I never knew why. I wanted to stay and do our job. It was merely told to me that we were going home, so we we nt home. Our original idea was to treat a few thousand people, b ut we went home after doing threeclinical trials. We left Malawi for the U.S. on April 27, 2006. I ag ain wound up out in the desert in Mina. Nothing has happened in Malawi since then, only lots of promises. I have been working for Arnold a s the foreman of a crew of men fixing up his mill. It is a chance for me to make a few dollars while I am writing this book. John is finan cing most of the operation there at the mill. (This is not the same John that was fired in Malawi. This is a friend of Arnold’s that has been helping with finance for some time.) They are spending hundreds of thous ands of dollars on the mill and mining operations. They keep talking about returning to Africa, but it doesn = t appear to me that it will happen any time soon because Arnold will have to be in charge of operati ons here or they will lose money. My single goal is to get the MMS to th e world, and thus this book. Up to this point Arnold still doesn = t allow me to talk to any of the new groups that he finds that are interested in helping our cause. I suppose that he believes that I am as bad with people as he is. Isn = t it normal for people to see faults in others that they themselves have? Things have changed see the update paragraph below. I have a strong desire to see the entire country of Malawi treated for malaria. Arnold and John continue to say that they will furnish the"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Malawi East Africa  Ch apter 8  Page 14 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century See Page 15 of this Chapter for data on obtaining M MS. money, but Arnold does not trust me to go to Malawi alone and he is not ready to go, as I write this book. However, ev en if they do treat all of Malawi, and start on the next country, they stil l plan to keep the MMS solution a secret. They want to treat all of Afric a while keeping it secret. I must see that the world gets the complete inform ation. Even if organizations and people throughout the world know the secret of MMS, that should not prevent us or others from seeing th at Africa is treated for all the diseases that the MMS will handle. Hopeful ly, everyone will understand that. I have furnished as much informat ion as I can in this book so that you, the reader, can save lives. You really can; please try. To give you an update as of now (8/10/2007): I left Arnolds operation last year, about mid year 2006 and came t o Mexico and self published the first edition of this book. Since then more than a thousand people have read the book and several thousand have taken the MMS. Many are well and liv es have been saved. At this date the 2 nd edition is about to be printed and the Spanish edition will be printed at the same time. I am hoping that this 2 nd edition will help furnish enough revenue to begin the project in Malawi of overcoming the malar ia there. So far this book has only been self published and s old on my Web Site, but as time goes by and the book continue s to be successful, I am sure a publisher will become inter ested and publish it more widely.

Chlorine dioxide is a high explosive and therefore wherever it is used it must be generated on site. It cannot be transported as chlo rine dioxide. It will instantly destroy any container that one mi ght try to house it in. It cannot even be moved through metal or plastic p ipes. Numerous methods have been devised to generate chlorine dio xide and many different chlorine chemicals are used for that purp ose. Chlorine dioxide is used for many industrial processes. It i s used in paper mills to bleach the paper pulp white. It is used in cloth mills to bleach cloth. Probably the most important use is to purify wa ter and thousands of water purification systems utilize chlorine d ioxide throughout the world. In water purification systems it is se lective for pathogens and other bioorganisms that might be harmful to la rger animals and humans. It does NOT combine with hundreds of constituents with which free chlorine will combine. Free ch lorine will combine with several items found in most water systems and wi ll create carcinogenic compounds. Thus, although the initial cost of installing a chlorine dioxide systems is higher, in the long run the chlorine dioxide systems save money and they are much safer f rom a health standpoint. One of the most popular methods of generating chlorine dioxi de is by various methods of treating sodium chlorite. It is a white or slightly yellow flaky substance, and if you bought a jar of it, it would be either white or slightly yellow flakes. Keep in mind that table salt is not quite the same thing. Note the spelling of the last two letters. Tab le salt is sodium chloride . We generate chlorine dioxide from sodium chlorite . See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Understanding the Miracle Mineral Supplement Cha pter 9 Page 2 The miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century Throughout the world today sodium chlorite (the formula is N aClO 2 ) is probably used to generate chlorine dioxide probably more often than any other method. For the formula for chlorine dioxide w e merely remove the Na which is sodium, and we have chlorine dioxide, ClO 2 . (Don = t worry, you don = t = have to understand these formulas to understand the basics of what I am writing here.) There are probably several dozen methods of using sodium chlorite to generate chlorine dioxide. The FDA approves several method s of just adding swimming pool acid to a watery solution of sodium chlorite for the purpose of making chlorine dioxide which is used to sterilize chicken or beef before it is sold to the public. The FDA specifies that it be rinsed off of the chicken or beef before s ale. The acid generates the chlorine dioxide from the sodium chlorite. Amazingly enough, in a hundred thousand health food stores i n the U.S. one can also find sodium chlorite in a watery form known a s Stabilized Oxygen. In almost all cases Stabilized Oxygen is manufactured by simply adding 3.5% sodium chlorite by weigh t to distilled water, that = s 35,000 ppm. You can do it in your kitchen. Just don = t use any metal pots and pans, not even stainless steel. Use only plastic or glass or Corning Ware. However, you will be mu ch better off making the Miracle Mineral Supplement with my for mula or buying it from someone who is using my formula. I’ll tell you e xactly how to do that later in this book. For 80 years hundreds of thousands of people have put a few dro ps of Stabilized Oxygen into their water or juice and drank it do wn thinking that it somehow furnished extra oxygen to their bod ies. The few that realized that some form of chlorine was generated, mentioned it in passing, but still insisted that the chlorit e furnished the body with oxygen. Somehow during all those years, not one of t he alternate medicine groups ever decided to have a good chemis t look at the formula, or at least not one of them wrote about doing so . The fact is that simple chemistry shows us that no oxygen is gener ated that the body can use. See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Understanding the Miracle Mineral Supplement Cha pter 9 Page 3 The miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century Chlorine dioxide is a powerful chemical and it has many uses. It is an oxidizer, more powerful than oxygen but it dose not use oxyge n. Chlorine dioxide explodes when it contacts certain chemica l conditions, and is neutral with other chemical conditions. It is selective. What do we mean when we say it explodes? Well, an explosion is merely a fast chemical reaction, mainly oxidat ion, that also releases energy . In the formula, ClO 2 , there are two oxygen ions. So why do these not get released these so that the body can use them? It = s because they have a minus two charge. They have already done their oxidizing before they arrived in this pos ition. They cannot oxidize further. But the chlorine can. When chlorine dioxide touches a pathogen or a poison that is acetic in nature, it ins tantly accepts five electrons. It destroys anything that it can dra w electrons from and generates heat at the same time (this action is calle d oxidation even when oxygen is not a part of it). The oxygen ato ms are then released from the chlorine dioxide, but they are not elemental oxygen. They are ions of oxygen with a negative two charge. They are at the same charge as the oxygen in carbon dioxide, a gas that will kill you if you breathe enough of it. T he carbon dioxide is not a poison. In other words it doesn’t do an ything to the lungs; it is sort of like drowning. It prevents the lung s from getting the elemental oxygen that they need. Hydrogen and oxygen mix together to become water. That = s about all that the oxygen can do at this time. It becomes water, or it can become part of a carbon dioxide molecule. The chlorine, afte r the explosion of oxidation, has also lost its charge and it becom es a chloride which is basically table salt, which again has no ab ility to oxidize as it no longer has any charge. There is nothing else l eft to cause any kind of a side effect. The basic idea is simply that oxygen and chlorine must be char ged to the correct number of electrons, or they do not do the job of oxidizing. When oxygen is not capable of oxidizing it simply cannot do the job in the body that is required for oxygen. Thus what so dium chlorite really does for us is it gives us chlorine dioxide, a chemical See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Understanding the Miracle Mineral Supplement Cha pter 9 Page 4 The miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century that is selectively to destroys almost all bad things that mi ght exist in the body. Each tiny chlorine dioxide molecule has tremendou s power to destroy those things from which it can dra w electrons. Chlorine dioxide does not last forever. It has too much energ y bundled into a small area. It begins to lose some of its energy after a few minutes in the body and the same thing happens when it is released into public water supplies. In the body when it has l ost some of its energy so that it no longer is explosive (unable to oxid ize) it can then combine with other substances. There is some evidence t hat it helps make myeloperoxidase, a chemical that the body uses to make hypochlorous acid that is then used by the immune system to fu rther kill pathogens, killer cells, and other things. Chlorine di oxide is the only chemical known that has these qualities and that can do t hese things in the body without creating side effects. In public w ater works, or the bleaching of paper pulp in paper mills, the chlo rine dioxide is generated on the site where it is used, and in the bo dy it is also generated on the site where it is used, from s odium chlorite. How to Generate Chlorine Dioxide in the Human Body All of those people who used Stabilized Oxygen for all those y ears didn = t realize the benefits were coming from the chlorine dioxide and thus no one ever tried to generate more of it. They believed th at the millions of oxygen ions that were connected to the chlorine w ere available to the body. Thus, they received the little benefi t that resulted from the fact that when a few drops of Stabilized Oxy gen is added to water it begins to release chlorine dioxide, but ver y slowly, too slowly to do much good. It releases a few chlorine dioxide ions per hour instead of per minute. There was always some benefit , but not nearly the full potential. For 80 years they m issed it. So if we are going to generate chlorine dioxide in the body, we need to do it about 1,000 times faster than what is now done when one adds a few drops of Stabilized Oxygen to a glass of water or jui ce. That gives you about 1 ppb (one part per billion) and what you r eally See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Understanding the Miracle Mineral Supplement Cha pter 9 Page 5 The miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century need is 1 ppm (one part per million), and often even more than t hat. In fact, sometimes it takes 1 ppt (one part per thousand). But don = t worry about those figures; one does not need to know all the technical details to make it work. Just know that to cure AIDS it takes at least a thousand times more chlorine dioxide than Stabili zed Oxygen gives you, actually more like 10,000 times. As it was mentioned above the FDA authorizes adding swimming pool acid to solutions of sodium chlorite in order to generat e chlorine dioxide. All of those public water purification plants that use sodium chlorite to make chlorine dioxide also use acid in various me chanical devices that add the acid at a pre established speed to a flow o f watery sodium chlorite. In the human body we have a tougher problem because we want to add a lot of chlorine dioxide, but n ot all at once. We want to allow it to exist for a few hours so that it ca n be carried around to all parts of the body. But chlorine dioxide deteriorates in minutes and will not exist in the body for hou rs if you just simply swallow some. There isn = t any mechanical mechanism that one can use to add acid slowly to a watery solution of sodi um chlorite inside the body. The Importance of Vinegar or Lime or lemon or Citri c Acid That is where vinegar or lime or lemon comes in. The part that i s important is the 5% acetic acid or the citric acid in lime or le mon. (Just recently, 7/1/2007, it has been discovered that pure c itric acid works even better than vinegar, or lime, or lemon.) When one o f these items is added to sodium chlorite it causes the solutio n to begin releasing chlorine dioxide on a continuous basis for about 1 2 hours. The addition of six drops of a solution that is 28% sodium chlo rite (that = s the Miracle Mineral Supplement) to 3 to 2 teaspoon of vinegar or lime or lemon will release approximately three mg s (3 milligrams) of chlorine dioxide in three minutes. That = s the reason for the three minute wait, but when you add water or apple juice to make about 2 glass of liquid the process slows down to one mg per hour. But three mgs is quite a bit for the body. Thus these acid s See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Understanding the Miracle Mineral Supplement Cha pter 9 Page 6 The miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century have a particular quality that works to create a continuous s upply of chlorine dioxide for about 12 hours. In addition to creating the continuous release of chlorine dioxide they also prevent th e solution from releasing chlorine dioxide too quickly when the stomac h acids mix with it. As the chlorine dioxide deteriorates new chlori ne dioxide is continuously being generated in the body. Adding vinegar or lime or lemon to the sodium chlorite does the trick. If you don = t add one of these items, all you have is the same old Stabilized Oxygen he alth drink, which isinteresting, but it really doesn = t get the job done. You can see from the above paragraph that the MMS starts off wi th three milligrams of chlorine dioxide and then continues to s upply chlorine dioxide to the body for about 12 hours. The initial t hree milligrams is what the body needs. The MMS works best to destr oy pathogens when 2 or 3 mg of free chlorine dioxide are in the sol ution at the time it is swallowed. It has an immediate effect. We hav e been talking all along about six drops which is a maintenance dose . If you are treating a disease 15 to 18 drops is a full dose. But read th e instructions, you usually start off with small dose s and work up. To give you an idea of what one milligram is, consider a standa rd U.S. dime. One gram is just about exactly 2 of a dime. Imagine 2 dime cut into a thousand pieces. One of those pieces is one milligram. That = s how powerful chlorine dioxide is. One milligram of chlorine dioxide begins killing pathogens in the body. Over a period of 12 hours the body will receive somewhere between 12 and 20 mgs, and there will be about two milligrams of chlorine dioxi de distributed through out the body at any one time, because as t he chlorine dioxide is generated it is either used up by destroy ing pathogens or it deteriorates into other harmless chemicals in just minutes. When the chlorine dioxide degenerates, the final c hemicals that are left are either chemicals that the immune system rea lly needs, or the chlorine just turns to a chloride making a tiny insigni ficant amount of table salt and water. Because of this there simply c an be no side effects. There is nothing left to cause si de effects. See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Understanding the Miracle Mineral Supplement Cha pter 9 Page 7 The miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century Make no mistake. Chlorine dioxide ions are extremely powerf ul. They bundle tremendous energy into a small particle. But the y only remain that way for a few minutes. They contain too much energ y to last for a lengthy amount of time. In the world of submicrosco pic energy particles, they are a torpedo with a selective warhea d. The chemical makeup of chlorine dioxide gives it that quality an d no other chemical has that same quality. Some people have taken more than 20 times the amount of Stabilized Oxygen (sodium chlorite). Perfectly healthy pe ople may have a small amount of nausea for 10 or 15 minutes from that lar ge of a dose, but if they have any bad conditions in their body, depending upon what they are, they might get nauseous for a pe riod. A few people including myself, have tried 25 times the recomm ended MMS dose, and that will make you nauseous but it does not leave side effects. (This has already been tried and it would be ext remely sickening to try it.) The point is, chlorine dioxide is not on ly not harmful but it is of great benefit to the body. Getting nauseo us is the result of the chlorine dioxide attacking some bad condition in the body. In the case of a liver condition such as hepatitis, one a lmost always gets nauseous. The reason for this is that the liver be gins to expel the poisons as the chlorine dioxide begins to destroy t hem. But it also cures the condition in record time. One lady with hepatitis C did just what I told her not to do. Ins tead of taking two drops at first, she wanted to be certain that she killed it. She took 30 drops, added the vinegar, waited three minutes an d added it to apple juice. It made her sick for three days. She th en put the MMS aside and did not touch it for eight months. She though t because it made her so sick that it didn = t work, but when she finally decided to go to the doctor he could find no hepatitis in her bo dy. Both were amazed. I have given it to many people with one of the hepatitis diseases A, B, or C. I can guarantee that 30 drops wi ll make any hepatitis patient feel very sick, but it will also cure th em. However, that is not the way to do it. A hepatitis patient shou ld never start out with more than two drops. In that case, normal ly they See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Understanding the Miracle Mineral Supplement Cha pter 9 Page 8 The miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century will not feel any nausea, and if they keep slowly increasing t he drops until they can take 15 drops twice a day without nausea, they w ill check negative to hepatitis of all kinds. Procedure for Taking MMS for Maintenance Taking the MMS for longevity is important. I wish I could say f or sure that it will give you an additional 25 years of life. I can = t prove it yet, but I believe it. All the evidence points to that conclusion. Dozens of older people are taking the MMS. All those diseases that norm ally kill older people simply no longer have the sting. The immune syst em can be 100 times stronger than normal in older people and then pneumonia and flu and other disease just don = t get a foothold, that is as long as one is taking the maintenance dose every day. Younger people can get by with taking the MMS maintenance dos e two or three times a week, but older people need to take it at le ast once a day. When taking it once a day, every day, one can probab ly get by with taking four drop doses, and be sure to take it with t he vinegar and three minute wait and then add the apple juice (se e below for exact instructions.) Anyone taking it two or three times a week should always take at least six drops for each dose. Reme mber, hundreds of thousands of people have been taking this soluti on for 80 years; all I have done is added a little food acid. No side ef fects have been reported in all these years, and no side effects hav e been reported in the six years since the vinegar was added. Techni cally there should be none. It has been proven that chlorine dioxid e does not attack healthy cells. (That is in the small quantities us ed in MMS. A large quantity would kill anyone or anything). Remember how it was pointed out earlier that the chlorine dio xide deteriorates into constituents that are totally nonpoison ous. Nothing is left behind to build up, as is the case in many conventional medicines. The chlorine dioxide lasts long enough to do its j ob, and then the part that does not furnish the immune system with nee ded ions becomes nothing but micro amounts of table salt and wate r. The See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Understanding the Miracle Mineral Supplement Cha pter 9 Page 9 The miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century chlorine dioxide has just a few minutes to do its thing and the n it no longer exists. It leaves nothing behind that can b uild up. Initial procedure: Keep in mind that anyone taking the MMS for the first time should start out with no more than two drops for the ir first dose. The reason is that the two drops will not produce enough chemical reaction to cause bad nausea in those who have some s ort of a health condition. If there is some really bad condition i n the body, two drops could cause a mild nausea for ten minutes or so . In that case, continue to take only two drops daily or several ti mes daily until there is no nausea. When one has reached the point where there is no nausea from two drops then use three drops the next time. Continue this until you are at six drops a day, and then mainta in six drops a day. When using for treatment of some serious illness , you will need to progress until you are taking much more than six d rops, depending upon the illness. Keep in mind, that when we refer to drops we always mean that on e must add 3 to 2 teaspoon of vinegar or lime or lemon or citric acid and then wait three minutes before adding 2 glass of juice. That = s four ounces of juice for those of you who are more scientific. Without the vinegar or lime or lemon, the whole exercise cons ists of drinking a nice health drink. But nice health drinks don = t do the job. And remember, DO NOT use juice with added vitamin C . So the exact procedure is this: Add two drops of MMS to a clean empty dry glass. Add the 3 to 2 teaspoon of vinegar (any kind of vinegar is okay including apple cider vinegar or white vineg ar) or lime or lemon (if you use citric acid see the instructions in chapt er 10). Swirl the glass by hand to mix the vinegar and drops. Wait thre e minutes. Add 2 glass of apple juice. Drink right away. You can substitute grape juice or pineapple juice as long as they are freshly made juices, meaning don = t buy juices with vitamin C added. Do not use orange juice. Orange juice prevents the production of ch lorine dioxide. See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Understanding the Miracle Mineral Supplement Cha pter 9 Page 10 The miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century The reason for using fresh juice is that most juices have vita min C added for a preservative. It makes the juice last longer and i t is good for you, but it inhibits the release of chlorine dioxide. It c an even prevent you from getting the results that you want from takin g the MMS. If you do use store bought juice make sure that it does not say that vitamin C has been added. If it does say vitamin C added, y ou can always drink it several hours before or after t aking the MMS. Allowing the drops and vinegar set more than three minutes is not necessarily a problem. The chlorine dioxide in the drops beg ins to separate and the chlorine goes off into the air and thus the concentrate of chlorine dioxide remains fairly constant fo r up to 2 hour, however tiny amounts of chlorine do remain in the solut ion. Putting a lid on the container makes the chlorine dioxide muc h stronger. Some people do this to make a stronger drink. The ve ry best practice is to not allow the drops and vinegar to go longe r than three minutes before adding your juice and drinking it. To be sure of a strong drink of chlorine dioxide, drink it imme diately after adding the juice. (It = s not dangerous to allow it to set longer, just not as effective). You can even let it set overnight, but the c hlorine can sometimes make you sick.) Juices that can be used are appl e juice, grape juice, pineapple juice, and cranberry juice. AGAIN: Do not try to use orange juice. Orange juice prevents t he production of chlorine dioxide and thus prevents the MMS fro m being effective. Further Technical Stuff: This is just to further clarify som e points made earlier. There are two levels of deterioration that tak e place when we are talking about a dose of MMS solution. (1) The first thing that deteriorates is the Sodium Chlorite. After the vi negar is added, the Sodium Chlorite begins to deteriorate releasing Chlorine Dioxide into the solution. Chlorine Dioxide is an extremely powerful ion containing vast amounts of energy in an extremely small a rea. (2) It is not a stable condition to hold that much energy and it too begins See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Understanding the Miracle Mineral Supplement Cha pter 9 Page 11 The miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century to deteriorate. The Chlorine Dioxide ion retains it ability to destroy pathogens, diseased cells, poisonous substances, and othe r harmful items for only about 30 minutes. It really begins to lose its e nergy within seconds of being released from the Sodium Chlorite, b ut it usually can do its job for up to 30 minutes. By the end of an hour or so, it has deteriorated to the point that it will no longer des troy pathogens but it can still combine with various other chemic als. Okay, so maybe I was over enthusiastic in saying A vast amounts of energy @ as it doesn = t sound very scientific. So lets just say, chlorine dioxide begins to deteriorate almost immediately until it is no long er chlorine dioxide. It separates into its constituents of chlorine and oxygen and energy and nothing else. The chlorine and oxygen under this condition have lost their charge and thus are not a ctive. As the chlorine dioxide continues to deteriorate, so does th e sodium chlorite. The deterioration of the sodium chlorite is at app roximately the same speed as the deterioration of the chlorine dioxide. Do you see? More chlorine dioxide is being generated by the sodium c hlorite all the time. Thus as the chlorine dioxide is consumed by killing pathogens or by simple deterioration it is replaced by the co ntinued deterioration of the sodium chlorite . The chlorine in sodium chlorite either combines with helpfu l chemicals that the immune system can use or it becomes a chlor ide which means it becomes a tiny part of a tiny amount of table sal t. Not enough to even record. The deterioration of chlorine dio xide in the human body leaves absolutely nothing behind. The action of destroying any pathogen or other harmful item in the body lea ves nothing behind but dead pathogens, and again a chloride and oxygen that can only become a part of the water of the body. Arnold and I founded the Malaria Solution Foundation. He’s i n charge. I withdrew from that foundation when I realized they were not very committed to treating malaria in Africa. They infor med me that they had plenty of money and millions to spend treating m alaria in Africa, but they continued with mining and rice distribut ion See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Understanding the Miracle Mineral Supplement Cha pter 9 Page 12 The miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century programs and nothing was happening with the program to distr ibute the MMS in Africa. If they really were committed, and they wer e too busy, they could have sent me. We have the answer to the disease that has been the biggest kil ler of mankind for hundreds of years. So while millions of people su ffer and die, what is my group doing? We’re over in Africa giving ou t rice bran packets to school children. That’s a nice program. It’s nice to help children, but our organization was formed to solve the p roblem of malaria. I may be beating this point to death, but there wer e a number of people who could not see why I left the foundation an d concentrated on writing this book. After several years I finally realized that I could not leave the data of the MMS information in their hands. The world would probably never know about it. It was then that I finally realized that t his information simply cannot be owned or controlled by any one p erson or group. The Malaria Solution Foundation Web Site (malariasolution.com) will also tell you much about the pro grams that we conducted in Africa and maybe give you some more confidenc e in what I have been saying. The MMS really works. (This site, b y the way, was just finished in the last part of 2006. It was 5 years s ince I was first told that they were going to put up a good site). Thei r last trip to Malawi last year. It had nothing to do with curing mala ria in that country. It had to do with distributing rice bran packet s to orphanages. That is a feel good program but what we founded th e Foundation for is not getting done. You could also check, if you want to, with the Malawi governme nt. They conducted their own separate tests with the Malaria Sol ution (the MMS) and got the same results as we did in the prison, 90% c ure for malaria patients in less than 24 hours and 100% cure in 48 h ours. Nothing else has ever had even a 10% cure rate in 24 hours or 48 hours. I have included two pictures of blood on the following pages.

Please don’t take my word for it; become informed. Read the information available on the Internet.

Isn’t that important enough to at least try it once on someone, or on yourself? Spend a couple of hours researching this issue. The facts are there. Treating Symptoms: Modern medicine, by way of doctors, treat symptoms. Drugs that you buy at any pharmacy are 99% directed towards symptoms. In other words, if you have a headache, the doctor gives you something for the pain, but doesn’t find out what is causing the headache. If you can’t sleep, the drug is something that helps you sleep, but the doctor doesn’t find out what is keeping you awake. If you get arthritis in the knee the doctor gives you a drug for the pain, he doesn’t find the reason for the arthritis. If you have poor digestion the doctor gives you a tablet that neutralizes the acid and allows the food to go through without digesting. He doesn’t find the cause of the poor digestion, or even give you something that will digest the food. There are a thousand different drugs directed at symptoms and the side effect of many of these drugs is death. All drugs have side effects. Not all of them have death as a side effect, but regardless, most of them have caused death at one time or another. Why do you suppose drugs in this world, especially in America, almost always treat symptoms and not the cause of diseases? It’s no secret about drugs only treating symptoms , most people know that already. Ask any person interested in health. Medical drugs treat symptoms and all of the See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Understanding the Miracle Mineral Supplement Cha pter 9 Page 16 The miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century medical research by pharmaceutical companies is directed towards treating symptoms, and not towards finding the cause of the problem. Well, the reason is that if you find the cause of a disease or health problem you can usually cure the problem. In that case you cannot continue to sell the drug over and over until the person dies. Billions of dollars are involved. Treating symptoms does not cure or change the problem. What is the reason that there has been no significant advancement in cancer treatment technology in 80 years? With one or two minor exceptions, the same treatments are still used more than 100 years later. The world has advanced fantastically in almost everything but cancer treatment and many other disease treatments. They refine the treatment, make the drugs more pure, make the needles better, make the X-ray machines better, make the records better, they make the timers better that time the treatment, but the treatment itself does not chang e. The pharmaceutical companies spend billions of dollars wit h two lawyers and often two law offices for each congressman and each senator in the United States. They have tried again and again to suppress vitamins. I don’t have time to cover all of the facts here. Please become informed on this subject. The data and the proof are available. The truth cannot be suppressed. Just read the thousands of documents available on the Internet. They spend billions influencing Congress on the pretense of public safety. Do you imagine that we would be much safer if we didn’t know about vitamins? The truth affects all countries of the world . At this time the FDA just informed the public that it intends to shut down over 50% of the alternate health type supplement companies. This is because they finally prevailed upon Congress to pass a law stating that all supplements must be under FDA control.

This has been proven through clinical trials in Malawi, a country in eastern Africa. In killing th e malaria parasite in the body, there was not a single failure. More than 75,000 malaria victims have taken the Miracle Mineral Supplement a nd are now back to work and living productive lives. After taking the Miracle Mineral Supplement AIDS pa tients are often disease free in three days and other diseases and c onditions simply disappear. If patients in the nearest hospital wer e treated with this Miracle supplement, over 50% of them would be back home within a week. For more than 100 years clinics and hospitals have used the active ingredients in this supplement to sterilize hospita l floors, tables, equipment, and other items. Now this same powerful germ-killer can be harnessed by the immune system to safely kill pa thogens in the human body. Amazing as it might seem, when used correctly, the immune system can use this killer to only attack those germs, bac teria and viruses that are harmful to the body, and does not affect the fr iendly bacteria in the body nor any of the healthy cells.

I do not suggest that the MMS cures diseases. It just supplies the immune system with a killer that it can use. The fact that the MM S does not attack healthy cells is evidence that the immune system is probably in control. When using the MMS the immune system proba bly becomes more than 100 times more efficient. (Please note: Some of the basic concepts are repea ted a number of times in this book. The reason for this is that people have a tendency to look up the instructions or concepts and then they want to go and use what they have read. They may not have read the whole book. In fact, they usually have not. In that case, hopeful ly the data has been repeated enough that they will get th e essence of the idea. But please read the whole boo k.) About the size of drops: Drops dropped from different size droppers are different in size. The larger the end of the dropper, the larger the drop will be. I refer in a ll cases to the standard MMS bottle and cap shown in this book (a four ounce green bottle is used). A “standard” eye dropper will create drops 2/3 the size of the drops that drop from the standard MMS bottle. If you are usin g a standard glass eye dropper that comes down to a point as shown bel ow, you should multiply the number of drops given in all the recip es in this book by 1.5. Again, I stipulate, anywhere the drops are men tioned in this book, multiply the number by 1.5 if you are using t he standard eye dropper. (See the pictures below.) When using the bottle dropper cap shown below, use the exact same number of drops that is See Chapter 20, page 6 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Curing Disease  Chapter 10  Page 2 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century suggested in the recipes of this book. Avoid using other droppers than these two mentioned here, to prevent getting t he wrong amount of solution. In case the world has stopped using bottle dropper caps as shown below, the dropper end size in this cap is .180” X .180” square. The dropper end size of the Standard Eye Dropper is rou nd and .125” in diameter. All amounts of MMS given in the various r eceipts are approximate. For those who are more scientifically inclined, 17 drops from the bottle cap equals one milliliter (that’s o ne CC). It takes about 25 drops from the standard eyedropper to equa l one milliliter. Water is not the same weight as MMS so don’t go ast ray with various other numbers concerning drops. MMS is 20% heavier than water and that changes the size of drops and the number o f the drops for one ml. Figure 1 When using drops from a standard eye dropp er always multiply the number of drops suggested in the book by 1.5. See Chapter 20, page 6 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Curing Diseases  Chapter 10  Page 3 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century As far as treating diseases is concerned, 15 drops are a standard dose . That of course means, that you also add ½ teaspoo n of vinegar, or lime juice, or lemon juice and the 15 d rops (from the cap in Figure 2 above) in a clean dry glass. Then swirl the glass to mix the vinegar or juice and drops and then you wait three minutes. After three minutes you add about 1/3 glass of water or f resh apple, grape, cranberry, or pineapple juice and then drink immedi ately. Without the vinegar, or lime juice, or lemon juice it will not work. Although it is acceptable to add water, juice will also work if it does not have vitamin C added to it. Normally on would then give a second 15 drop dose in one hour. However, as already mention ed, 15 drops is too much to start with, thus one would start with l ess. But still, two doses one hour apart is often a very good idea. It seems to get better penetration. Drops in a Teaspoon : A level teaspoon of lemon juice or 10% citric acid solution is about 80 drops. So a quarter teas poon is 20 drops. A little too much lemon juice or citric acid makes no difference at all. Just don’t get too little or you get poor results. On the other hand, a little too much MMS can make you sick so always cou nt the drops for MMS. There is a problem with a 15 drop dose . If the person taking such a dose is not fairly healthy, it will have a tendency to cause nausea. The immune system attacks unhealthy conditions usin g the MMS. There has never been any evidence of an attack on h ealthy cells. But if one supplies the immune system with excessiv e MMS, the See Chapter 20, page 6 for data on obtaining MMS.

It’s what the body needs, but a nauseous reaction s ometimes occurs, occasionally even vomiting. When this does occur, one has simply taken too large a dose at first. When you kill a l ot of bacteria or virus or parasites that have poison in them, that poison is likely to be dumped into the system. For this reason it is advi sable to give a dose of two drops or even one for the first dose just to see what is going to happen. When giving two drop doses it is permissib le to use a little less than ½ teaspoon of vinegar or lime juice, but no less than ¼ teaspoon. Or read further in this chapter to learn about using citric acid instead of vinegar or lime. Situations vary; the healthier a person is the more drops he or she can start with. When a person is very sick, start with two drops or even one drop an d go to the second drop immediately if the first drop didn’t make him nauseous. Wait a couple of hours and increase by one drop. Back off for a while if he shows signs of being sicker. A very sick person sh ould receive a dose of some strength every four hours during the day an d in some cases every hour, but very small doses . Almost always the sick person will begin to feel better within 24 hours. If the MMS i s used by the immune system to break loose some poisons that can then make a person a little nauseous. Just don’t give up. Red uce the number of drops per dose to a point where the person is not e xperiencing nausea. Then start increasing the drops at each dos e as long as the person does not become nauseous. Keep at it until y ou have reached 15 drop doses that do not make the person nauseous. Then do two 15 drop doses within two hours. Then do that a sec ond time during the day. Then do that each day until the person is well. Normally a person will be well by the time he has increased do ses to 15 drops, but if not keep at it. Larger than 15 drop doses . As already mentioned, if 15 drops is good, so maybe 45 drops is three times as good. Fo r goodness sakes, don’t go that far. In extreme cases maybe t ry a couple of 25 drop doses within two hours of each other. The fac t is, I have had reports back from people who, when they did not get the results that they wanted, resorted to as much as 25 drops. In t hat case they were careful to use a full ½ teaspoon of vinegar or 1.5 teaspoons of lemon See Chapter 20, page 6 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Curing Diseases  Chapter 10  Page 5 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century or lime or citric acid. The wait is three minutes or slightly longer. Never, never, never, start off with 25 drops. In f act, only in extreme cases go to more than 15 drop doses. The two doses within two hours counts as a very large dose. Be careful. Exception to the rule, one would only start off with a large dose such as 15 drops in the case of parasites. If one had t aken a poison or has food poisoning, a good dose of MMS will often help. My friend next door caught some kind of a walking a round flu. His throat was sore and he was continuously coughing an d hacking. It went on for three weeks and didn’t let up. He then began taking the MMS. He took 15 drop doses for several days with n o change. Then out of desperation he squirted in a 25 drop do se. He added a teaspoon of vinegar, waited the three minutes, adde d the apple juice and downed it. The next day the hacking and coughi ng was gone. He took a second 25 drop dose and the next day the rest of the symptoms were gone. Later just for research, he tr ied several doses larger than 25 drops, but he noticed a metallic tas te in his mouth the rest of the day, so he decided never to go over 25 drops. I am saying, however, never go over 15 drops unless you absolutely have to. For people who cannot stand vinegar replace the vinegar with lime juice. Lemon juice is slightly less effective, but it is OK, maybe use an extra drop. All other factors should remain the sa me. I have found that many people prefer lime or lemon juice over vi negar. Anyone suspected of having Candida should not use vinegar in any amount. Citric Acid a recent discovery: Dr. Hesselink, the doctor who has written the last chapter of this book made an impor tant discovery concerning citric acid. He was getting his friend ready to go to Africa to use the MMS there. He felt it would be best to give his friend bottles with the dry MMS powder (sodium chlorite) a nd then in Africa his friend could just add water to the bottles. He then decided to do the same with the lemon juice to be used as the act ivator. For this purpose he bought citric acid powder since that is the acid in lemons. See Chapter 20, page 6 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Curing Disease  Chapter 10  Page 6 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century Well it worked fine. His friend made a big hit and helped many sick people get well. After the Doctor’s friend returned from Africa Dr. Hesselink was sitting talking to one of his other friends who had lyme arthritis. This is an extremely bad case of lyme arthritis. He sug gested to his friend that he mix a dose of MMS drink same as the one his friend used in Africa. That was 12 drops of MMS and 60 drops of c itric acid solution.He did so and amazingly the arthritis was gone the next morning and has not returned. What Dr. Hesselink used to kill other friend’s lyme arthritis was MMS and the citric acid. One other point was he used t he citric acid at a strength of about 5 times the strength of what the lemon juice would be. It wasn’t meant to be that strong, but that is what it turned out to be. So I have been recommending using the lemon ju ice at that same strength for some time and it is also working. Evaluation of the Citric acid incident. Obviously the citric acid works as hundreds of people have used it so far and it wo rked on Dr. Hesselink’s friend’s arthritis. It appears to be m ore effective than vinegar or lime for activation, because I was able to measure a greater amount of chlorine dioxide present in the s olution. It is 10 times the strength of the vinegar activated MMS. S o if you try it, let us know if you get as good results as we have so fa r. Instructions for using MMS with citric acid as the activator (instead of vinegar or lemon or lime). Obtain citric acid in powder form as citric acid crystals. Some health food stores carry them, or you can order them from a pharmacy (heaven forbid). Make a 10% s olution of citric acid. To make a 10% solution put one level tablespoon full of crystals in a clean glass or jar. Then add 9 level tablespoons full of purified water into the same jar. When the crystal s have dissolved this is a 10% solution. In all cases when using th e citric acid as an activator, use 5 drops for each 1 drop of MMS. Do everything else the same. Wait 3 minutes after mixing, add juice a nd drink. See Chapter 20, page 6 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Curing Diseases  Chapter 10  Page 7 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century When using the citric acid as an activator be sure to keep in mind all of the other instructions concerning taking the MMS . Start with taking 2 drops of MMS and ten drops of citric acid and then work up to greater amounts. Lyme disease: For the most part lyme disease seems to be the wo rst of all so long as you are talking about diseases th at are very hard to cure or that destroy the various organs of the body and is extremely disabling. In the case of Lyme no doubt the immune system needs MMS. The best results so far has been with MMS act ivated with the citric acid solution given in this chapter. Small doses every two hours seem to be the best results giving the immune syste m plenty of help. The basic concept again is work up to it slowly but increase until something is improving. In most cases if you are not improving, probably yo u are not taking enough. However, it might take as long as a year t o overcome the lyme disease. There is no proof of that yet, but t he information I have received back is that everyone who has lyme an d who is taking MMS is experiencing improvement. What time during the day is best to take MMS? It is best to take MMS just before going to bed. M MS works very fast, and the body likes to start healing very fast. Peo ple often become sleepy after taking a dose of MMS. That simply mea ns that the body wants to begin healing. It is well known that most healing is done during sleep. If you get sleepy after a dose of MM S it is a very good sign so take a nap if you can. You will probably f eel much better when you awaken. Also, if you take it twice in a day, take one of the doses it in the evening before going to bed. However, if you feel a cold coming on in the mornin g or in the afternoon do not wait until bedtime to take a dose. Take a dose anytime you feel like something is trying to come o n. Children: It is perfectly safe to have children and babies t o take the MMS. Of course, children must have fewer drops tha n adults.

Ot her than babies, use 3 drops for each 25 pounds (11.4 KG) of body weight for children. Overweight people: Start with 2 drops only for the first dose and work up to three drops per each 25 pounds of body w eight. Follow instructions given in this chapter for “working up” to higher doses. Malaria: The procedure for malaria is to always start with a 15 drop dose, and give a second 15 drops dose in one to two hours. (Remember, if you use a standard eye dropper, multi ply these figures by 1.5 which in this case would be rounded off to 2 3 drops). Expect most of the symptoms to be gone within four hours o f the second dose, but don’t worry if the symptoms are not gone after four hours beyond the second dose, simply give a third dose. All malaria parasites are dead after the second dose. If the p atient is still sick, it will not be from malaria. It will be from some oth er disease. In that case, continue with at least two 15 drop doses each day until they are feeling well. Arthritis: There are some things that you should know about arthritis if you have the problem. First, it doesn’t matter how bad it is, your body will heal it, but you have to follow the corre ct procedure. So you need to know what kind of arthritis you have as MMS will help with rheumatoid arthritis and lyme arthritis and so me others, but not with normal arthritis. Normal arthritis is caused by the muscles in the ar ea pulling in the wrong direction. The wrong muscles are trying to t ake over and move the body in that area. When these muscles beg in to pull against one another they create pain and tension in the area and begin to destroy the joint. You can get it back to working again. The book Pain Free by Pete Egoscue tells how to get the correct muscl es back to working again, and the body then heals the joint no matter how bad the bones are scraping against one another. It’s just requires some unusual exercises to get the correct muscles back to working correctly. In most cases, even severe case s, the pain is gone in a week.

Hepatitis A, B, and C and all other strains of Hepa titis: the patients needs 15 drops twice a day, but will not usually to lerate 15 drops. When using 15 drops immediately, the immune system attacks too hard. Start with two drops and if that does not mak e them nauseous try three drops on the next dose later that same da y. If it does make them nauseous try one drop on the next dose that sa me day. Always continue with one drop until they can take it witho ut nausea, then go to two. Most people can start out with two drops. Keep increasing the drops until the person can take 15 drops twice a day. Be careful to avoid nausea as that often makes the person afra id of the MMS and they will quit and you won’t be able to get the m to start again.

A pers on needs to get accustomed to this mineral drink. Herpes : The ads on TV can make you sick when you know tha t herpes can be easily cured when the immune system h as the proper ammunition. About a week of 15 drop doses twice a day and no more herpes. Of course, one must start with two dr op doses and increase daily until he has reached 15 drop doses a nd then increase the 15 drop dose to twice a day for about a week. That means the herpes should be gone in about two weeks. However, in very bad cases, it might take up to two months to finally ov ercome the herpes. I suggest you use the citric acid as the activator in the case of herpes. With severe cases take the MMS every two hours for several days. When taking it every two hours, one can take smalle r doses. This keeps the MMS penetrating deeper and deeper. In wo rse cases, one may have to use the MMS intravenously. See the ch apter one IV. People like to bash the ideas I give here that thes e things can be cured by the immune system. So before you send me a bad letter, why don’t you just try what I tell you here. It ca n’t cost you much and what you learn might eventually save your life. If it doesn’t work, then send me a nasty letter. Let me say thou gh, that for every criticism there have been hundreds of encouragement s. AIDS: MMS does not attack AIDS. The immune system does. It merely needs the right ammunition. As usual start w ith two drops, but at least three times a day. Increase the drops as quickly as you can until reaching 15 drop doses three times a day. It will take from three days to three months, but usually less than 3 0 days. Some cases may only clear up with intravenous injections . A doctor should always do this. See the chapter on intravenous inje ctions. Please note: normally healthy people can take these drops without nausea, especially after a meal. Only people sick with some kind of disease will get nausea when taking the drops. How ever, nausea is a good indication that the drops are doing some good. See Chapter 20, page 6 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Curing Diseases  Chapter 10  Page 11 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century Just so you know, when we first learned about the u se of citric acid I measured the strength of the solution. The chlorin e dioxide present measured much higher than when the vinegar or the l ime or lemon juices were used. But the body seemed to tolerate it more easily and thus I decided to see what a reasonably healthy bod y could tolerate. I started low and built up slowly to 30 drops twice a day. I never felt any nausea or other negative reactions. Thirty dro ps twice a day is probably more than anyone will ever need. Thus we know that so long as there is nothing there to be killed or dest royed or neutralized one can expect no reaction from the dose. Usually even sick people do not experience nausea w hen taking MMS, but do not be surprised when people get sick o r have nausea, or diarrhea, or even vomit after taking a few drops of MMS. Try to take it or give it immediately after a meal. The MM S allows the immune system to correct various conditions in the body and this creates solutions that the body must expel during t he process. This is normal; however, if you always start with only two drops it is unlikely that you will make anyone sick. Chlorine dioxide is more powerful than any drug by far and more powerful than any other nutrient, at least that is the case in the immune system. The immune system selects out and a ttacks many things that are not natural to the body and it does it immediately. On top of that, it also destroys poisons that have bee n generated by the disease. That’s why thousands of malaria patients j ust got up out of their beds and went home in four hours. That’s why many AIDS patients in Uganda went home in three days. The fa ct is, a single dose has at times given the immune system enough am munition to totally overcome hepatitis C. That’s probably why i t is the only thing known to overcome an abscessed tooth (when the absc ess is on the outside of the tooth). On vary rare occasions someone may have a little na usea from two drops, but that seldom will be the case. I mean ra re as in one in 500 cases. But in the case of malaria and some other di seases caused by See Chapter 20, page 6 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"Curing Disease  Chapter 10  Page 12 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century parasites, one does not start with only two drops. The malaria victim is very sick and needs relief. It takes 15 drops t o do any good. So give them 15 drops and wait a little over an hour a nd then give them another 15 drops. They will have tremendous relief and the malaria parasite will be dead. This is also true of many o ther diseases caused by parasites. On the other hand, some diseases have the ability to dig in deep and it may take weeks or even months of tak ing the MMS for the immune system to completely destroy them. The fact is, MMS is usually extremely fast acting. Diarrhea and vomiting may not always be avoided . In other words, if you take MMS in any amount you may get diarrhea. Everyone does not get diarrhea, but some people need to be c leaned out. If that is true in your case, you will probably not be able to avoid diarrhea. It seems that your body knows what is ne eded when MMS is taken. As the immune system becomes more activa ted, the more things begin to take place in the body. There are t hings that the body does not want to allow to process through the diges tive system, so it will cause vomiting. It hasn’t hurt a single perso n so far and everyone has felt better after vomiting. In every case when diarrhea hits or vomiting takes place assume it is what is n eeded and it is a good indicator that healing is taking place. Using MMS in the eyes: Follow these directions WITH EXTREME CARE, as you can cause problems to your eyes. Use one drop of MMS in one tablespoon of distilled water or eye dro ps that you buy from a drugstore. Wash your eye with the liquid fr om the tablespoon making sure it gets directly into your eye. Allow it to stay in for 15 seconds. Do not try to guess 15 seconds. Use a wa tch with a second hand. Then use distilled water or eye drops to was h the eye until you are certain that you have washed every bit of l iquid out of your eye. Do this every two hours until the infection i n your eye is gone . Begin taking MMS by mouth using 3 to 4 drop doses e very hour until you notice a big improvement in your eyes. If you c annot put drops in your eyes, you can depend upon the doses by mout h if you do it every hour. REMEMBER: You MUST NOT allow the liqui d with a drop of MMS to remain in your eye. If you do it wi ll cause a burn.

I left some MMS in my eye thinking that since I didn’t feel anything from it that it didn’t have enough strength to do damage. I was wrong. It didn’t do any notic eable damage to the eye ball, but the skin around my eyes dropped a nd stretched downward about an inch. I looked terrible like my eyeball might fall out and I was worried, but it cleared up in a few d ays.) Cancer, including leukemia: The theory here is the same. Chlorine dioxide gives the immune system almost perfect ammu nition to attack cancer cells. We believe the theory has pr oven true as many people with cancer have told us that the cancer wen t away or reduced greatly after taking the MMS. However, the re is not yet enough research in this area. Still, it’s a lot be tter than standard medical treatment. People have often told us, and we have noticed, that skin cancer usually dries up and drops off wit hin one week of taking 15 drops of MMS twice a day. We do not clai m that the MMS cause the effect, but we did observe the effect. So me cancers are harder to treat than others and in the case where t he cancer does not start to disappear within about two weeks of starti ng to take 15 drops twice a day one should also get some Indian Herb fr om a lady in Oklahoma. An update for this 2 nd edition is that when one is working with cancer and it is not getting better an over ruling concept is that you are not taking enough MMS. Start as always with 2 drops in the morning and go to 3 drops in the afternoon. Then 4 drops t he next morning then begin taking it every 4 hours, then every 2 ho urs. Keep increasing the dosage and frequency of taking the d oses. Anytime you begin to notice nausea, decrease the number of drops in the doses. Then begin increasing the number of drops r ight away again. You could get up to 10 drops every 2 hours while aw ake. Also remember, you must always activate with vinegar, or lemon, or citric acid solution, and of course, use the 3 minute wait before adding juice or water to drink it. I favor the citric ac id, using 5X the number of MMS drops.

She has many letters that indicate that. We merely report w hat people have said. The information on where to get the Indian H erb is at the end of this chapter. Do not hesitate to go to at least 30 drops twice a day of the MMS, or 15 drops four times a day when necessary, or more. J ust keep taking less if you notice nausea, but then continue to increase when the nausea go away. As I write these lines, my friend next door has jus t overcome a small melanoma cancer on his arm. I mentioned that he wa s taking larger doses at 25 drops per dose. (I do not necessarily r ecommend doses that high, but do what works). In any case he had a lready checked with his doctor to confirm it was actually a melano ma. After only a week of taking the MMS the melanoma begin to have a white ring around it and it then it became smaller and smaller until after about two weeks it was gone. That is, at least we could not see it any more and there was no longer any sore feeling. On a small cancerous sore on the back of my hand th at would not go away for over a year, I put one drop of MMS mixed w ith 3 drops of lemon juice, and as usual waited 3 minutes and then added 2 drops of DMSO. It immediately felt like someone had put a blow torch on my hand. But the pain was gone in 3 minutes. A la rge brown spot appeared much larger than the small sore. I put Va seline and a bandage on it and in 2 days the entire brown spot f ell off leaving a large gaping hole. I put more Vaseline on it and a nother bandage and in 4 days it healed completely up and did not e ven leave a scar. (Note: I have removed the warning about DMSO from t his book as there seems to be no problem with it.) I would say , in this case, that the DMSO carried the MMS deep into the cancerous so re, killing it in See Chapter 20, page 6 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Curing Diseases  Chapter 10  Page 15 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century three minutes and when the pain stopped it was dead . It is not my suggestion that anyone try this. (Let me know if y ou do.) Asthma: MMS has often stopped an asthma attack in 10 minute s or less, but it doesn’t work every time. MMS works be st with asthma over a longer period of time. It depends upon the condition of the asthma whether or not it stops an attack instantly or how long it takes to cure a condition of asthma. MMS will always hel p, but if a person is “beyond repair,” then MMS will not do the job. However, over a period of time it will often cure the asthma. Start with two drops twice a day for the first day, taking the drops after a meal. If the person gets nauseous he will o ften stop taking the solution and refuse to take more so be careful to a void making someone nauseous. In any case, work up to 15 drops twice a day. It may take months before one can do this without bein g nauseous. This is because the MMS is slowly destroying someth ing and is bringing about detoxification of the body. (That’s what I think, but the fact is I have watched many people get well fro m various diseases and they usually are well and feeling energetic whe n the drops are no longer causing nausea.) Asthma is not easy to clea r up, but it has cleared up in those who kept with it. Arteriosclerosis: I guess there are many causes for hardening and clogging the arteries of the body, but cholesterol seems to be one of the best known reasons. Several people have report ed to date that taking the MMS reduced the clogging of the arteries due to cholesterol. One lady called to say that she was i n very bad shape. They had told her that her veins were 80% clogged. They couldn’t say how much worse because they couldn’t measure an y more than that. She took large doses of 15 drops, three time s a day, for 30 days and when they measured again, the clogging was less than 50%. That is a tremendous change in 30 days. That ’s not much to go on, but it gives you an idea. Remember, we are just talking about a supplement. Also remember, 975,000 people die ea ch year from medical drug causes. No one is dead from MMS. See Chapter 20, page 6 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"Curing Disease  Chapter 10  Page 16 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century There is a great deal of evidence to indicate that cholesterol deposits in the arteries veins around the heart are not the cause of heart attacks. The evidence points out that the walls of these vessels, about 10 inches on the heart, are collapsed 70 to 8 0 times every minute with each beat of the heart for our entire l ifes. The walls of these vessels are strengthened by vitamin C and wit h a deficiency in vitamin C they lose their strength. When the vesse l walls crack they remain collapsed and this is when the heart attack happens. The cholesterol that medical people say is clogging the veins has really been deposited there to compensate for the deficien cy in vitamin C. It is the body’s secondary defense to prevent colla psed walls of thearteries and veins. Take 6 to 10 grams of vitam in C daily. Reduce the amount if you get diarrhea. Dr. Matthia s Rath researched this data. Get his book, Why Animals do not have Heart Attacks . Check the Internet. The proof has been establis hed as well as it can be, certainly a hundred times better than the idea that cholesterol drugs will make you less likely to have a heart attack. My opinion in this case would be to take a lot of v itamin C for a few weeks before using the MMS to clean out the cholest erol. Make sure the walls of the blood vessels are strong before re moving the cholesterol. Read Dr. Matthias Rath’s books. All known diseases and negative medical conditions: I have not listed a great number of diseases which can be hand led by the immune system in hours, days, or only a week or two , as there are so many. The MMS will probably help the immune system do its job no matter what the disease. Diseases that are not ca used by viruses, bacteria, and other various germs may not be attack ed directly by the MMS, but the benefit may come indirectly. Almost a ny disease generates various poisons which in turn cause the b ody to be sick. When the immune system has chlorine dioxide which, of course, is furnished by the MMS it can often neutralize such p oisons. Never assume that MMS will not improve the immune system no matter how weak of a condition the immune system might be in or no matter what disease may be present in the body. See Chapter 20, page 6 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Curing Diseases  Chapter 10  Page 17 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century Take MMS daily to keep the body clean of most poiso ns and disease causing organisms. Diseases that the immune system cannot help directl y: The immune system can use the MMS to attack diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, parasites, yeast and molds, but many disea ses are caused by other medical conditions. Maybe this is the case, b ut since the first edition hundreds of people have reported almost eve ry medical condition known as having been improved. Examples o f diseases that do not respond to MMS are, well, maybe NONE. S ome diseases need to be handled by the proper diet. The immune system, when supplied with MMS, almost always produces some impr ovement in these diseases and their associated conditions. Everyone who has reported having lupus and also rep orted taking the MMS has also reported feeling back to normal. All cases of diabetes that have reported taking the MMS have als o reported doing better, not all cured, but doing better. Even thos e with depression have reported feeling better. One child with ADD h as reported all symptoms were gone in two weeks. There is much benefit from improving the immune sys tem as these diseases often cause weakened conditions and weaken the immune system as well. Bacteria and virus have a tendency to attack in weakened areas of the body. Pneumonia, for example , is much more likely to attack when the body is weakened. W ith MMS the immune system can fight back and often overcome the infections or other conditions that have been caused by the weake ned condition. This can in turn help other diseases to clear up. For those people who would like to overcome any bad condition not caused by bacteria or viruses, the book Eat to Live by Joel Fuhrman, M. D. can give you many important insights into the causes of such conditions, and how to overcome them. Remember, chlorine dioxide is the most powerful kil ler of pathogens known to man . When used by the immune system, it is still the most powerful killer of pathogens and the most powerful detoxifier known.

(MMS can also be used intravenously eith er with drip or direct injection, see Chapter 13. I would suggest that chelating clinics use MMS with IV’s as they can then be of real benef it. ) I say all this with only the best intention. I hav e plenty of axes to grind, but I do not do this for any other reason th an mankind must have this amazing Miracle Mineral Supplement. I am not selling anything. (Well maybe this book, but any profit wil l go towards helping the people of Africa overcome the diseases there.) I tell everyone exactly how to make MMS in their own kitch en. I even suggest places that you can buy the chemical and I give complete details for you to make it. My only intention is t o see that mankind gets the discovery. It is too important for me to have any other agenda. You can even make it and sell it on the In ternet or to your neighbors. But more important, you can make it and save lives. Just follow the directions here and give it to anyone wh o has some terrible disease. You can be of help to many, many people. Look around you, there are always those who need it. Yo u can help old people with their health problems and young people, too. If you sell it on the Internet, just don’t make any claims. If you give it to someone and they get well, you can tell that story on the Internet. I have from time to time been accused of treating d iseases without a license. Some doctors have climbed on their high horse and said that I was putting lives at risk. I have always an swered that they have one hell of a nerve being critical of simply giving a mineral solution that is not a drug. Any medical doctor is to some extent a part of the medical system. They either approve of Big PHARMA o r they go along with them. Each year in the United States mo re than 975,000 people die of medical drug causes. More people die from that than any other cause of death. That’s 975,000 deaths th at should not have occurred. When I mention medical drug causes I am talking abo ut those who died because they were given the wrong drug in the hospital or a See Chapter 20, page 6 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Curing Diseases  Chapter 10  Page 19 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century clinic, or were given an overdose, or who had an AD R (adverse drug reaction), or had a drug taken away too quickly, or who died from drug side effects (many). Why do you think that wh en they advertise a drug on TV that they required to mention the drug ’s side effects. One of the things that they say is, “Serious or fat al reactions have occurred.” The fact is that the majority of drug deaths could have been prevented. Yet it continues year after year while the government agency (the FDA) will spend millions stopping a hea lth food item that might have caused one death. Drugs make money for the d rug companies and for doctors. They (Medical people) f eel that they must attack any item that might take the place of a drug and reduce their income. The government statistics agency has provided the c auses of death in their statistics, giving 699,697 for heart disease and 553,251 a year for cancer. They do not mention one single death c aused by medical prescription drugs, and their statistical research shows none. When a person with cancer dies from being given the wrong drug, the government simply reports it as a cancer death. Th e drug death is included in the report, but not in the government s tatistics. Gary Null PhD who researched much of the report “Death by Med icine” was able to dig out the true statistics because the dat a is available and it cannot be suppressed. Refer to the references give n at the end of this chapter. The people in the US of A are spending billions of dollars on medical treatments and we could have the best medical treat ment on the planet, but it has not even come close. And then t here are those doctors who are so scared they will lose revenue th at they feel that they must attack the MMS. So let me say this. Since we are not talking about a drug, why attack it or me? Why not take a day or two and check it o ut? Try it. See if it works. It’s simple. Does it work or doesn’t it ? Don’t take my word, or someone else’s word, try it yourself.

Warnings: (1) Do not allow children to use MMS unsupervised. (2) Do not allow MMS to set in direct sunlight even if it is in a color ed bottle as it will create pressure in the container which could ruptur e and cause severe burns. MMS that has set in direct sunlight can cause very pai nful burns. (3) Never allow full strength MMS to remain on your skin for more than 10 seconds as it can cause mild burns. In the case of a brown recluse spider bite, use only diaper rash ointment (Desitin) or other diaper rash ointment co ntaining at least 40% zinc oxide. I mention this as some people have tried to use MMS for brown recluse spider bites and it had very little effect on the poison. Desitin contains 40% zinc oxide. It will kill most of the poison and reduce the pain and itching of a brown r ecluse spider bite in less than one day. I say this after seeing dozen s of people treat their bite with this diaper rash ointment. Black Widow bites: As long as we are talking about spider bites let me mention a remedy for Black Widow bites. Slice o pen a stem of freshly cut Aloe Vera leaf and put the open slice p art against the bite. Use a piece about two inches by two inches. Then t ape the Aloe Vera leaf over the bite with tape holding it tight against the bite and excluding most of the air. Leave it for at least 1 2 hours before putting a fresh piece on the bite. Most or all of the bite poison will be gone in 12 hours. Insect bites, mosquitoes and other bugs not particularly poisonous but irritating. A really heavy mosquito bite can b e very uncomfortable for several hours. Use MMS as if you were going to drink it. Put 10 drops in a glass and add ½ teaspo on of vinegar or a full teaspoon of citric acid. Wait three minutes; then put the solution full strength (just the drops and vinegar) directly on the bite. Rub it in with the tips of your fingers. The itching from the bite will be gone in about 5 minutes and the bump will begin to dimin ish immediately. See Chapter 20, page 6 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Curing Diseases  Chapter 10  Page 21 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century You do not need to wash this solution off. Once yo u have added the vinegar to the MMS you have negated its ability to burn your skin. Once vinegar has been added the alkalinity of the s olution has been destroyed. However, when using the solution in lar ger areas of the body than a small insect bite always add about 1/2 cup of water to the 10-drop solution that you make mix. Using MMS on the Outside of the Body: Please read this carefully. It is possible to cause problems on the outside of the body when using MMS in too strong of a solution. Once you have add ed vinegar to the MMS it can not longer cause a burn, but it can still cause a problem when used full strength. When adding six t o ten drops in a glass with ½ teaspoon of vinegar with the exception of insect bites in a small area of the body, always add over ½ glass of water before putting on the outside of the body or in the hair. Never add the 10 drops mixture to any kind of body lotion. When the MMS solution is too strong on the outside of the body, it can weake n the cells and make them more susceptible to bacteria and infectio n. On the other hand, when used in a weak enough solution, like add ing the ½ glass of water, it can help a great deal. For jock itch and that sort of thing, after applying some body lotion then spread the sol ution from the ½ glass of water with your finger tips. Sores on the head: Follow the instructions for the insect bites above, but be sure to add ½ glass of water to the 10-drop solution of MMS and vinegar. When combed into the hair with enough solution to penetrate to the scalp it will cure most head sores in a few hours. If you use it daily it makes for a healthy scalp, but it also makes you a blond. In other words once or twice a month is oka y, but when used daily you begin to notice that your hair is bleachi ng blond after a few days. (It is a very nice blond.) Prevention: Information has already been presented that MMS improves the immune system. The fact is, MMS is a super preventative for almost any disease known. It’s my opinion, after observing hundreds of people taking MMS, that it wi ll prevent most See Chapter 20, page 6 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Curing Disease  Chapter 10  Page 22 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century cancer, including breast cancer. But not just canc er, any disease that the immune system can attack can be prevented or ai ded in prevention by supercharging the immune system with MMS. I would appreciate email letters from anyone notici ng information concerning all aspect of the MMS, either pro or con . If you cannot afford health insurance, you definitely should be t aking MMS every day. When your problem doesn’t clear up right away: Many people call and say, “I’ve been taking 12 drops twice a day for weeks, but when I go to 14 drops I have diarrhea badly.” I always reply that chlorine dioxide is the strongest oxidizer known. And that is all it is. It only oxidizes and nothing else. So if you body has a lo t of unhealthy gunk deposited in critical areas that is making you sick, or if it has poisons such as heavy metals deposited, or if there is a heavy load of bacteria growing somewhere, or any other unhealthy condition it will continue to work on that stuff day after day. Afte r all, you are only using a few drops each day, and those few drops onl y contain a couple of milligrams of chlorine dioxide. You may have thousands of times more stuff that needs to be oxidized that a few drops can handle, but it is working on it. And the fact that you get sick or have diarrhea when you take a heavier dose proves that i t is oxidizing the stuff and your body can only throw off a certain am ount each day. If you give it more to throw off than it can do withou t getting violent, then it will get violent. Just keep the dose up ju st under the nausea level. You will finally get there, but know that i t is working as long as it makes you sick when you take too much. When it quits making you sick, you will be well. Some diseases allow mu ch heavier loads of bacteria and virus. It can take a while. Don’t get discouraged, keep at it. Bird Flu, Pandemic and other Mass Hysteria: For over 100 years chlorine dioxide has been used to sterilize hospita l floors, benches, and equipment, and to purify water, and for sterili zing meat. During that time no pathogen has ever developed any kind o f a successful resistance to chlorine dioxide. Due to the nature of chlorine dioxide See Chapter 20, page 6 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Curing Diseases  Chapter 10  Page 23 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century it is doubtful that any pathogen ever will. Severa l doctors have mentioned that the very nature of microorganisms’ s tructure eliminates the possibility of ever developing a res istance to the oxidizing powers of chlorine dioxide. It’s like tr ying to develop a resistance to hand grenades or dynamite. The explo sion is too violent to resist. It is doubtful that any of thes e new mass hysteria or germ warfare diseases will be able to resist chlori ne dioxide, that is to say, MMS. Chlorine dioxide was used to kill Anthra x during the 2001 Anthrax attack. Now anyone can use it in the body as well. Be sure to keep some present in your medicine cabinet. One other point, you can bet that the pharmaceutica l companies will soon find an inoculation for bird flue. They will then want to inoculate everyone in the world, especially in the U.S. They will say they want to save us, but all they really want is t o make billions of dollars. Diabetes, ALS, and many other diseases of which the y claim they don’t know the cause: There are a number of viruses that might be considered exotic. They really aren’t, but unless you are a doctor you won’t hear much about them, but you should, bec ause they are abundantly present. The Coxsackie B virus, accordi ng to much of the present medical literature, causes up to 1/3 of the heart attacks. It causes the heart to become inflamed. The heart doe sn’t work very well when inflamed. It is also reported that this virus causes the pancreas to become inflamed thus causing type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Then for ALS (Lou Gehrig disease) there is medical literature indicating the echo virus – 6 and – 7 is most likel y the cause. If that is so, then there is a chance that MMS can help cas es of ALS. In which cases I would start at one or two drops every two hours and increase the number of drops up to 6 to 8 drops eve ry two hours for as long as one is awake and up out of bed using, of course, the citric acid activator and three minute wait before adding the juice or water and drinking the solution. The idea is to keep the body as saturated as possible with the chlorine dioxide. Of course t here is no See Chapter 20, page 6 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Curing Disease  Chapter 10  Page 24 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century guarantee, but up to this time there has never been even a slight glimmer of hope. If you are diagnosed with ALS you have 2 to 5 years and that’s all. They had stuff that they cla imed slowed it down a bit, and of course, they got a lot of money for i t, but there never was any real data indicating the ALS was slowed dow n. Trying MMS just may work. Nothing else does. So, it’s wo rth a try. Curing diseases with drugs? Can it be done? No. The only thing that ever heals the body is the various mechanisms of the body. Healing is controlled by the body. NO drug or no n utrient can heal the body. NOT ONE! There are things that the body can use to aid in the healing, but in the final analysis, the body always does the healing. Drugs occasionally help the process, but n ormally the body needs nutrients instead of poisons, which all drugs are to a greater or lesser extent. MMS is the same. It cannot heal or cure the body of anything. It may or may not kill pathogens in the body without the body’s control. However, once the germs or pathoge ns or poisons are destroyed, healing can take place at a much fas ter rate. This is why healing in so many parts of the body seems to h appen so much quicker. It is not that the MMS has healed anythin g. It cannot. But it can clear the way for healing to take place. Overcoming cancer and many other terrible diseases. Be sure to read this paragraph . MMS seems to be effective against most diseases, but some diseases require much more MMS t han others. Normally the answer is if you are not getting impro vement, take more MMS. This means that you should start off wit h 2 drops, using the lime or vinegar or citric acid and the 3 minute wait as always,s and then add juice or water and drink. Continue to increase the number of drops twice a day, if you can. Go to 3 d rops, then 4 drops, then 6 drops and so on until you reach 15. Stay at 15 drops a day for several days, then do it twice a day. Then , if you do not notice an improvement increase the number of drops. Always reduce the number of drops if you feel nausea, but continue to increase the number of drops, keeping below the nau sea level as much as you can. Increase up to 20, or 25, or even as much as 30 drops twice a day, for a serious condition. See Chapter 20, page 6 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Curing Diseases  Chapter 10  Page 25 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century Be very careful. If you feel nausea, reduce the nu mber of drops. Do not remain at high, 20-30 drop levels unless you r eally see an improvement in the condition you are trying to hand le. When the condition is overcome, be sure to drop back to only 6 drops a day for maintenance. However, if you do get nausea or vomiting or diarrh ea do not be worried. Many times the body needs to get rid of s omething. Many times a health expert or doctor may advise you that you need to get yourself cleaned out. Well, if you need it, the MM S is going to do it. It’s not a bad sign. Antidote for too much MMS: For someone who has taken too larger a dose of MMS and is then nauseous, it is possible to drink a glass of cold water to which has been added 1000 MG of vitam in C. Bicarbonate of soda also acts as such an antidote. Use a level teaspoon full of bicarbonate or take an Alka-Seltze r tablet in a glass of water. If you us the vitamin C do not use the b icarbonate of soda or Alka-Seltzer. Use either one but not both. Overdose of sodium chlorite: Anyone who has consumed more than ½ teaspoon of the miracle mineral should immediatel y begin drinking water, as much as possible. It is possibl e to drink as much as several tablespoons of MMS right straight from t he bottle, but this would make one very sick. If this occurs begin to drink as much water as possible. It is best to add ½ teaspoon fu ll of bicarbonate of soda to each glass of water. Be sure to see a doct or or emergency poison clinic. Training: You have read this book and hopefully you now know how to use the MMS. BUT if you make up some MMS for o thers, YOU must train people to use it properly. Do not expec t that you can rely only on the directions on the bottle. No, no, no, and no! People must be trained to use the MMS. If you give someon e a bottle, sit down with them and actually do a training session. Have them drop two to six drops of MMS in an empty glass, add ¼ te aspoon of See Chapter 20, page 6 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Curing Disease  Chapter 10  Page 26 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century vinegar and swirl. Wait three minutes, add ½ glass of apple juice, then you drink a dose and have them drink a dose. Please, believe me, this is the only way it works. People must be shown. In the past eight years every mistake in th e world has been made, and many of the mistakes simply keep it from working. I already told you about the lady that took 30 drop s the first time. She was sick for three days. I told one other lady that she must put six drops in an empty glass and add ½ teaspoon of v inegar, wait three minutes and add ½ grass of apple juice. She promptly went home and added six drops of MMS to ½ cup of full st rength vinegar. She later told me that before she finished drinking that ½ cup of vinegar sweat was running off her forehead and down her neck. The vinegar got in her eyes and she could barely see. Everything that could go wrong has gone wrong. Some prepared it the night before (never allow more than ½ hour betw een mixing it and drinking it), and some tried it in their coffee (never do this). Almost no one gets it right without at least one se ssion of training. It’s too simple. Everyone expects it to be more com plex. So please, please, train each person to whom you sell or give a bottle to. Not to do so means you are asking for failure and it is un fair to them. Also, don’t think that most people will be able to do it right and only a few will fail. Not so! Most will fail, in one way or another, if not trained. Just be sure to do the demo with each sale or gift. I plan to have training classes in Mexico for those who want a real education in using MMS. Follow the instructions and you can save lives and watch people get better. Benefits that happen within the body when someone t akes MMS. These are the things that I have observed over the past 10 years. Some of it is my opinion, however, I have discussed all of the See Chapter 20, page 6 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Curing Diseases  Chapter 10  Page 27 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century following information with medical doctors who have agreed with me. But then some of that was their opinion as wel l. So this is what appears to be happening in the body when MMS is ingested after using the various activators listed in this chapter. The first thing that the MMS does is destroy anaerobic microorgani sms including viruses, bacteria, molds, yeast, and para sites. These are the disease causing organisms. There are many reas ons to believe that this is what happens. This generally happens between 4 hours and 4 weeks, but in less than one week in most case s This includes all forms of infection and other microorganisms. A lso blood diseases such as leukemia. Secondly , the MMS oxidizes the heavy metals within the body . I believe this because there have been a number of te sts where the hair roots were checked before and after taking MMS . Afterwards, the heavy metals were gone. That includes mercury and lead and several other metals. Unfortunately, hair root tes ting is not totally accurate, but it is a good indication. Oxidation of the heavy metals is not the same process as chelating, but the results are the same. When a heavy metal is oxidized it is neutralized an d is simply washed out of the body. Thirdly , the MMS is carried through out the body and where it neutralizes foreign matter that is generally poison ous to the body. When oxidized, these poisons are neutralized and me rely wash out of the body. Almost all poisonous material will be ac idic in nature, thus allowing the MMS to recognize it. These poisons wi ll all be attached at various locations and they will be hindering the function of the body. As they are oxidized they will no longer sta y attached and will be washed out of the body. Fourth , most forms of poisons from snakes and other venom ous animals are oxidized when adequate amounts of MMS a re taken. Most food poisons found in restaurants or in your r efrigerator are oxidized, which is why one should take a number of doses when feeling the effects of food poisoning. See Chapter 20, page 6 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Curing Disease  Chapter 10  Page 28 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century Fifth , the poison generated in burns, particularly type 3 burns when covered immediately with MMS, or even within hours, is neutralized by the MMS.

There is some kind of a chemical created in a burn that is neutralized by MMS. A burn is best treated by MMS immediately after the burn, but it can still help even hours later. When a burn happens, no matter how bad, one should squirt the MMS full strength straight out of the bottle all ov er the burn. Do not use the vinegar in this case. Using the tips of yo ur fingers, very lightly with a feather touch make sure it is spread complet ely on the burn. LET IS REMAIN THERE for only 30 seconds to a minute. Do not allow your fingers to press on the burn in any way. If you had a paint brush handy, that would be best. But don’t s pend any time looking for a paint brush. The sooner you get the M MS on the burn the better. The acidic chemical in the burn is neu tralized by the alkaline solution of the MMS. The pain stops immed iately, within seconds. Wash the MMS off with water . When treating a burn, make sure you leave it on for at least 30 seconds. Count slowly to 30 before washing it off. You absolutely must wash it off or the burn will become worse . If you do this correctly, the burn will heal in about ¼ the ordina ry time for a similar untreated burn. The MMS must be washed off with water within 30 to 60 seconds. If water is not available do not use the MMS unti l you are sure that something is available to wash the burn o ff.

I can’t prove that at this time, but I believe it. The thing that kills older people is a poor immune system. As you get older, your immune system goes bad. MMS changes that. When one is taking the MMS on a regu lar basis his immune system becomes supercharged. There is littl e to nothing that can get by the immune system in that case. Our dark field microscope has shown that the longer one continues to use the MMS the more supercharged the immune sys tem becomes as far as white blood cells are concerned. After treating hundreds of people for six years it is my opinion that no disease known to man that is caused by pathogens (viruses, bacteria, parasites or other micro organisms) can w ithstand an immune system being treated daily with MMS. One mi ght need to increase dosing on occasions when the flu season is extremely bad or other diseases are around. The body seems to recognize flu bugs. For a person taking the MMS it then tends to react as it always has when flu hi ts, except for one thing. The reaction usually lasts less than 24 hour s, and on rare occasions as much as 48 hours. The flu is 1/10 as severe as when one is not taking the MMS. Most diseases will neve r occur, but some do show up as a mini disease that is gone in hours.

Chlorine dioxide is a gas that is dissolved in water when in the body. Chlorine and chlorine dioxide have been used as disinfectants for more than a hundred years and there is little doubt that they simply destroy pathogens of all kinds. Both have been used in water purification systems for mo re than 50 years. In recent years, in water purification systems chlo rine has been used less and chlorine dioxide a great deal more as it h as many benefits over chlorine. Chlorine dioxide is used extensivel y in water purification systems throughout Europe. Although c hlorine dioxide is somewhat more expensive than chlorine, its many ben efits over chlorine has resulted in it being more extensively used in water purification systems than chlorine. In 1998 The Am erican Chemical Society, Analytical Chemistry Division said chlorin e dioxide is the most powerful antimicrobial agent known to man. Chlorine dioxide kills pathogens by oxidation, a co mpletely different chemical reaction than that of chlorine (chlorinati on) and oxidation results in no harmful chemicals. A 10-ppm drink of chlorine in juice will cause a healthy person several hours of nausea , while a 10-ppm drink of chlorine dioxide causes no nausea at all f or a healthy person, and yet it is more efficient in killing pathogens t han chlorine. None of the functions or elements of the human body including friendly aerobic bacteria are affected by chlorine dioxide in diluted solutions of 50-ppm or less. On the other hand, so lutions of 0.1 to 1- ppm seem to induce a spectacular immune response re action attacking anaerobic bacterium, viruses, parasites, harmful molds, yeasts and other pathogens. Without realizing it, hundreds of See Chapter 20, page 6 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Chlorine Dioxide and Blood Chemistry Chap ter 14 Page 2 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century thousands of Americans have been drinking diluted s olutions of chlorine dioxide for more than 100 years in various health waters sold to the public. Diluted solutions of salt trea ted with electricity have been sold as “health water” under various name s such as “Willard Water” which is still being sold. Most of these waters contain low levels of chlorine dioxide as a result of the electrolytic treatment. The chlorine dioxide concentration in su ch water was very low and thus was never strong enough to do a thorou gh job of killing pathogens in the body, however the benefits claimed for these health waters were more than likely caused by the chlorine dioxide as there is no other element in the water that would seem be neficial. Other health drinks have been sold that contain various c hlorine derivatives. Stabilized Oxygen which is a diluted solution of sodium chlorite when diluted further with water very slowl y gives off chlorine dioxide. The MMS is just a stronger solution to whi ch a food grade acid has been added. The acid such as vinegar or c itric acid often used in soft drinks reduces the solution to an acid condition but still within a food range which releases up to about 1-pp m chlorine dioxide, a level of concentration that is sometimes found in processed food but is 100’s of times that which is produced in Stabilized Oxygen. Because of the acetic acid in the vinegar, or citri c acid, when added to a sodium chlorite solution, the solution begins to release chlorine dioxide on a linear timed basis for up to 12 hours. Stomach acid does not tend to significantly change this timed re lease. The amount of salts and vinegar is calculated to release one m illigram of chlorine dioxide per hour. An hour is the amount of time th at it takes one milligram of chlorine dioxide to deteriorate into t able salt and other harmless chemicals plus one very useful chemical. T he linear production of chlorine dioxide and its constant det erioration into table salt and chemicals brings about a constant le vel of chlorine dioxide in the body for approximately 12 hours at w hich time all chlorine dioxide deteriorates leaving no trace and nothing that is deleterious to the body. Thus the poison index aft er that period of time is zero.

No pathogen can resist them an d no disease, either bacterial or virus has ever developed a resi stance to chlorine dioxide. The human body has very few mechanisms tha t can differentiate between oxygen and chlorine dioxide. Since red blood cells cannot tell the difference, strong evidence i ndicates as the MMS enters the stomach, absorption mechanisms in the st omach walls allow the red blood cells to absorb the chlorine di oxide and carry it to various areas of the body where oxygen ions are nor mally taken. The natural pH of the human body is approximately 7 . At pH 7 chlorine dioxide, in the absence of light, is fairl y stable for a few minutes. However, disease pathogens are essentiall y all anaerobic and have a different fingerprint than that of frien dly aerobic bacteria as do malaria parasites. As mentioned above, the r ed blood cells readily absorb the chlorine dioxide and once in the cell they attack the malaria parasite because the surface of the par asite has a lower pH than the blood. Chlorine dioxide is an extremely high explosive and it is so volatile that it cannot be transported. The only way that c hlorine dioxide can be utilized is for it to be generated on site and u sed as it is generated, or generated in situ (in place). It is the volatil e nature of chlorine dioxide when it contacts pathogens that makes it so effective both in water systems and within the human body. As doctor Hesselink has pointed out in chapter 22 of this book, the ver y nature of the malaria parasite prevents it from ever developing a resistance to chlorine dioxide. However, we also believe that th e volatility of chlorine dioxide also helps prevents pathogens from developing a resistance to it. It’s sort of like trying to deve lop a resistance to hand grenades. You just can’t do it. Normal levels of oxygen in the blood cannot destroy all of the pathogens present under disease conditions, however , when chlorine See Chapter 20, page 6 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Chlorine Dioxide and Blood Chemistry Chap ter 14 Page 4 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century dioxide is adsorbed with the oxygen it is a differe nt story. When a chlorine dioxide ion contacts a harmful pathogen it instantly accepts five electrons from the pathogen, or it might be mo re descriptive to say that it instantly tears off five electrons. An extremely fast chemical reaction is in essence an explosion, and t his is exactly what happens on a microscopic level. The damage to the p athogen is a result of losing electrons to the chlorine ion and the release of energy. The pathogen, basically, is oxidized by chlorine io ns and as a part of the action the chlorine becomes a harmless chloride (table salt). Two atoms of oxygen are released as ions from the chlor ine dioxide ion but the oxygen has little effect other than to atta ch to hydrogen ions making water or attach to a carbon ion to make carb on dioxide. It is the process of the chlorine dioxide ion oxidi zing pathogens or other harmful chemicals that is beneficial to the b ody. Although the two oxygen ions of the chlorine dioxide ion are rel eased, their charge level does not result in oxidation. The same proces s continues throughout the body where chlorine dioxide ions con tact pathogens. It does not attack beneficial bacteria or healthy b ody parts, as their pH is not below 7. It will also oxidize diseased c ells, such as infections or cancer. In the event that the chlori ne dioxide does not contact a pathogen or other poison, it deteriorates into table salt and hypochlorous acid that is useable by the body. The lymph nodes, for example, are one of the areas where the blood normally releases oxygen to oxidize various poisons in the node and then it carries the oxidized poisons away to the li ver. The red blood cells carry the chlorine dioxide ions the same as o xygen and thus chlorine dioxide ions are also released in the lymp h nodes. The chlorine dioxide ions are inert to normal cells but they will destroy disease pathogens found there. A minute amount of naturally produced chlorine diox ide is found in the human body, and one of the chemicals that chlor ine dioxide helps to create as it deteriorates is myeloperoxida se a chemical that the immune system needs. The immune system uses th is chemical, See Chapter 20, page 6 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"Chlorine Dioxide and Blood Chemistry Chap ter 14 Page 5 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century myeloperoxidase, to generate hypochlorous acid. The body uses hypochlorous acid extensively to kill parasites, ba cteria, fungi, viruses, tumor cells, natural killer cells, and to destroy some waste products under normal conditions. However, diseases and body conditions can result in a deficiency in the hypoch lorous acid needed to destroy the pathogens that are present. This is due to a medical condition known as myeloperoxidase deficiency. In t he case of many other diseases there are other immune system reacti ons that can overcome the diseases, however in the cases of mala ria and other extreme diseases, there is not enough hypochlorous acid to kill the parasites or pathogens, nor are there any other imm une system reactions that can destroy them. Thus the hypochlo rous acid created by chlorine dioxide as it deteriorates in the body is probably another mechanism by which malaria and other diseases are d estroyed. In the case of the MMS, when taken by mouth by a ma laria victim after adding vinegar and juice, all malaria symptom s including chills, fever, aching muscles and joints, headache, nausea, and other symptoms are gone within four hours in 98% of all c ases. The other 2% are symptom free within 12 hours. Although some malaria victims are sick from other diseases, we have never found a case in which the malaria parasite was not destroyed. To t his date, July 1, 2006, more than 75,000 malaria victims have been tr eated with no serious side effects reported. Since normally two d eaths per each 250-malaria victims is expected, and zero deaths we re reported in the 75,000 cases treated, we must assume that 300 lives have been saved and that the MMS is doing its job. In February of 2006 clinical trials were conducted in a prison in the country of Malawi East Africa. The results were a 100% cure rate of all malaria victims treated in the prison. Several months later in the same year the Malawi government made its own separa te clinical trials. They reported with the same results. All malaria victims treated recovered and there were no failures.

When using Stabilized Oxygen at the standard 3.5% t o make MMS (using vinegar), use eight times the number of drops as is specified in the various recipes listed in this bo ok. If you are using a standard eye dropper as shown in chapter 10 use 12 times the number of drops as is specified in the va rious recipes listed in this book. 5. One drop of MMS contains nine milligrams of sodium chlorite 6. When six drops are mixed with ½ teaspoon of vineg ar in a dry clean glass, one milligram of chlorine dioxide will be generated in three minutes. The solution will not become much stronger than one milligram as the chlorine dioxide near the surface of the liquid goes into the air. You can m ake it stronger by putting a lid on the solution preventing much of the chlorine from escaping. 7. When ½ glass of apple juice, grape juice, or pineap ple juice is added to the mixture given in number 6 above, and t he drink is consumed , one milligram of chlorine dioxide will be generat ed each hour for approximately 12 hours within the hum an body. 8. Chlorine dioxide, generated by MMS, is the most p owerful killer known to man of microorganisms, such as, vir uses, bacteria, parasite, molds and yeasts.

Without vinegar or citric there is very little benefit. Do not use vinegar or citric when used intravenously. The blood will accomplish what the vinegar would do otherwise, but it does it more slo wly. 11. Any vinegar is okay to use, but must be 5 - 6% acetic acid. 12. Any sodium chlorite for use in laboratory or for u se in water treatment for humans is acceptable for making MMS. (When using 15 drops and then adding juice to drink, the amount of impurities in 15 drops is insignificant when consid ering the maximum allowable daily impurities that might be al lowed for a human being to consume.) 13. Sodium chlorite is used throughout the world to generate chlorine dioxide for water purification, for bleach ing of paper pulp, for bleaching of cotton, and hundreds of othe r uses in industry. 14. Sodium chlorite was first used for treatment of humans in 1926 in Germany by Dr. William F. Koch, MD, Ph.D. It has been use in the U. S. since 1930. 15. Since 1926 it has been considered by those who use sodium chlorite that it is Stabilized Oxygen and that it f urnishes oxygen to various parts of the body. That is a mistaken idea . No useable oxygen is available from sodium chlorite. But Chlo rine dioxide is also an oxidizer. However, it is much more powerfu l than oxygen. 16.

It pr events the chlorine dioxide from being generated. 18. Apple juice, cranberry juice, grape juice, and pin eapple juice are okay to add to the MMS drink after the three mi nute wait if the juices have not had vitamin C added. The best idea is to use fresh juices that you know do not have vitamin C ad ded. Most other juices prevent the MMS action that is necessa ry. Very few manufacturers do not use vitamin C as a preservativ e. Read the label very carefully. If vitamin C has been added do not use the juice. 19. Shelf life, if the bottle has not set in the di rect sunlight, is two to four years if the bottle is dark glass or plasti c. Clear glass or plastic is okay for a short period of one or two da ys. If the bottle sets in the direct sunlight it will last only about an hour even when if it is in dark glass or plastic. 20. Full strength MMS is alkaline at a pH of 13. It c an cause a slight burn if not washed off of the skin in less t han a minute. Flush with water. When vinegar is added to the 6 o r 12 or even 18 drops the pH is then 4.5. When apple juice is a dded after three minutes the pH matches the apple juice exactl y, which is approximately 4.8. The other juices mentioned in t his book are similar. Use only apple juice, grape juice, pineapp le juice, or cranberry juice that has not had extra vitamin C ad ded. 21. MMS can be used to purify water.

As you can see from the prices above, b uying a 100 pound barrel will cost you less than trying to get 10 pounds. The problem is, you need a company to buy 100 pound bar rels as a general rule. Some of these companies, listed on t he Internet, will sell to individuals. Of course, you can make up your own company and tha t will work in many cases, but there are those companies that r equire your company state or city resale number. You might be able to find a local business that will receive the sodium chlorit e for you and let you use their name for this purpose or just order it fo r you. Alternately, you could just buy a resale number from your city. Finding industrial sources for 100 pound drums is a little harder than buying lab supplies. Go to Google and put in “Drin king water See Chapter 20 page 6 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Overview of the Use of MMS and Main Points Chapter 15 Page 7 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century chemicals,” or “drinking water treatment chemicals. ” Of course, use Google for the country you are in. Most countries will have sodium chlorite for water purification. Or look up NSF on the Internet or NSF/ANSI Standard 60. This is an association which many companies that sell sodium chlorite belong to. Jus t start calling the various companies that sell sodium chlorite for wat er purification. You will eventually find one that will sell you the 100 pound barrel between $250 and $400. Then it will cost you about $150 shipping because it is a hazardous chemical unless you can d rive to pick it up. There is a LA Chemical Company division in Atlanta, Las Vegas, and many other cities in the US. Keep in mind with tha t barrel of 100 pounds you can make 500,000 doses. That is approxi mately 1/10 cent per dose. At a last minute decision, on my way south to publi sh this book, I managed to buy a 100 pound barrel of sodium chlorit e from the Los Angeles Chemical Company of Los Angeles, California for the price of $278.00. The lowest price so far. I picked thi s barrel up at their Las Vegas division. Since I picked it up myself th ere was no shipping costs. They will not sell to an individual. You m ust be registered with them as a company. I formed a small company i n a Nevada town and then called them to order a barrel. They put my company in their data base when I called them up. They the n ordered the barrel for me and told me it would be available at their location in Las Vegas the next week. There was no problem. I paid for it with my personal credit card at the time I picked it up as I had not established credit with them.

That should last you and your family for a couple of years. MMS is light sensitive so you must bottle it in a very dark glass or plastic bottle, or in dark opaque plastic. Dark gr een, blue, or brown transparent plastic is okay. The light that goes t hrough these dark colors will not harm the MMS. Don’t worry about th e MMS being out in the daylight for a couple of days. However , never allow it to set in the direct sunlight. Sunlight will ruin it in an hour even when it’s in a dark plastic bottle. The reason that we use 12.6 ounces is because that’ s how many ounces of MMS 100 grams of sodium chlorite will mak e. The reason for that is 100 grams of sodium chlorite is the eas iest amount that you can purchase. Many chemical supply houses sell 100 grams for about $30. Five or six pounds can be purchased at laboratory chemical supply shops for $300, but if you are seri ous bulk quantities of 100 pound barrels sell for about $400 at differe nt industrial chemical companies. (See Chapter 15 for data on bu ying sodium chlorite.) An update from a reader tells me that a 110 pound barrel sells for $224.40 at the Los Angeles Chemical compa ny. But they have a $300 minimum thus he bought two barrels. However, if worse comes to worse, and you really ne ed to do something immediately to cure some problem or you just want to prove it works there will certainly be at least one health food store near you that carries Stabilized Oxygen. Buy some of that and use eight times as many drops as is given in this book as a dose. The dose that they suggest on the bottle isn’t enough t o cure a mouse.

See the end of Chapter 8). If you are using a regular eye dropper then the dr ops are much smaller than from the bottle mentioned in this book so you should use at least 16 times the drops given in the instructions in this book. (That is if you are using the standard 3.5%, Stabilized Oxygen from the health food store. I hope you understand that MMS at 28% plus the size of the drops is 12 times stronger tha n the Stabilized Oxygen so use 12 drops of Stabilized Oxygen for eac h single drop of MMS that you would use. Do everything else told her e, that is add the vinegar or citric acid or Lemon or lime wait 3 minutes, add apple juice and drink. The bottle is gone in a week or t wo. On the other hand, expect most diseases to be cured in that amou nt of time. Also keep in mind that there are a few groups that sell Stabilized Oxygen that isn’t really Stabilized Oxygen, but rather som e other chemical that they think is better than sodium chlorite. Do not expect other chemicals to work, because they will not. In the last several years different companies have offered various strengths of sodium chlorite solution thus making d ifferent strengths of Stabilized Oxygen. One group sells it at 25% wh ich is close to the MMS which is 28%. If you did get the 25% strength it would be okay to just use all of the recipes and drops as given i n this book. See the second half of chapter 15 for directions on how to find and buy sodium chlorite and also see chapter 17. It’s harder to get now- a-days because of the terrorist problem. What you will need to make 12.6 ounces of MMS : 1. You will need at least a 15 ounce bottle. It can be clear plastic if you do not intend to keep the liquid in the bott le for more than a couple of days. This is OK if you are waiting to transfer the liquid to dark bottles or containers. Just be sure that you do not leave the liquid MMS in the clear bottle.

Don’t leave it in a refrig erator as refrigerators are opened to the light too often. 2. At least one quart of distilled water . Do not use any other kind of water. It’s okay to used purified water if it says, “For all distilled water purposes.” Do not use spring water of mineral water unless it is an emergency and you can’t wait. 3. A plastic pitcher that has a good pouring spout. 4. A one quart pan or larger that can be heated. Do not use metal including stainless steel. Use glass or Corn ing Ware or a new Teflon coated pot that does not have any scratc hes through to the metal. 5. Some kind of fairly accurate gram scales . Should be accurate to 1/10 gram. An electronic postal scale will do. Postal spring scales would be okay if you had some accurate weigh ts to adjust the scale with just before you use it. 6. A black marking pen . Be sure you have one on hand. 7. Some small bottles to put the MMS solution in after you make it . Many pharmacies have small brown bottles with dro ppers. It’s okay to use these bottles so long as you never allo w the MMS solution to get up into the rubber bulb. If you ti p the bottle over, remove the dropper and wash it out with water makin g sure the bulb is washed thoroughly. 8. You will need at least 100 grams of sodium chlorite . When buying this chemical make sure it is chlorite that you are buying and not chloride. Chloride will not work. You will notice that the sodium chlorite comes in flakes, either white or slightly yellow.

Tell them it is for water purification tests. The first thing that they will tell you is that their chemicals are not for internal use. That is not something to worry about. That is what all t he sources of sodium chlorite specify, even those that sell their chemicals for public water systems. Remember, when you add distilled wa ter you are diluting the chemical. Then when you use only 12 d rops and you dilute that with ½ glass of water or juice, any imp urities are also diluted. By the time you have done that much dilut ion, the impurities are always way below the maximum allowab le impurities per day that you can afford to put in your body. T he sales people are always worried about being sued, so they will a lways try to talk you out of buying the chemical, or even refuse to s ell it to you if you tell them what you are going to use it for.

I worry that someone might try to fool you into thi nking some other powder is sodium chlorite in order to make you fail at curing someone, or just some clerk might be too dumb to se ll you the correct powder. So here is how you check to make s ure that you absolutely have the correct powder. First you must buy the strips that test for chlorine from any swimming pool store . Cost is $6.00 to $12.00 for 50 test strips. (1) When you open your package the sodium chlorite must be flaky. If there is no flakes assume that you do not have s odium chlorite, but go ahead and do the other steps given here. If the chemical passes the following tests it is indeed sodium chlorite an d they, for some reason, ground the flakes before you got it. (2) Crush up a few of the flakes into powder. (Do this by putting the flakes into a tablespoon and crushing with a second spoon). (3) Put ½ teaspoon of the crushed powder into an em pty glass and add three level teaspoons of distilled water. Swir l gently until the See Chapter 20, page 6 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"How to Make MMS in Your Kitchen  Chapter 16  Page 5 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century powder is completely dissolved in the water. You c ould warm slightly to aid in dissolving or you could heat the three teaspoons of water before adding to the powder. (4) Now drop 10 drops of this solution into an empt y glass. Add ½ teaspoon of vinegar. Any vinegar will do as long a s it says “5% acetic acid” or “5% acidity.” Wait three minutes. (5) Wet a pool chlorine strip with this solution. It should read at least 1 ppm chlorine present. It is actually reading chl orine dioxide (pool chlorine strips can’t tell the difference). (6) Now wet a second pool chlorine indicator strip with the original solution from which you took the 10 drops. This so lution should read no chlorine present (because you haven’t added the vinegar to that solution). If the chlorine indicator strip sh ows chlorine at this point something is wrong. Do the test again. If i t still shows chlorine at this point where no vinegar has been added do no t use this chemical. Keep in mind that if you let the solutio n set for hours it might read a small amount of chlorine. If your powder fails either step 5 or step 6 you do not have sodium chlorite powder. Someone is fooling you or they h ave made a mistake. Run the test one more time to make sure. If it doesn’t pass the test, don’t use it. Don’t accuse anyone. Don’ t upset anyone. Just ask for some real stuff. If your powder is okay, follow the steps given belo w . Making the MMS solution : The MMS solution is 28% sodium chlorite powder. The 100 grams is 28% of 357 grams. That is 12.6 ounces. If you buy a bottle of 100 grams, you should just c heck that it indeed has 100 grams in it before adding it to the solutio n. One hundred grams is 3.54 ounces.

Step 2 : Measure out nine ounces of distilled water and add it to your heating pot. Be very careful to get nine ounces ex actly. Step 3 : Now dump the 3.54 ounces (the 100 grams) of sodiu m chlorite into the 9 ounces of water in the heating pot. The heating pot should not be on the fire yet. Put the heating pot on the hot plate and stir until dissolved. Once the white fla kes or powder is dissolved, immediately remove it from the fire. It should never be heated to the boiling point. It should only be war m when the sodium chlorite is finally dissolved. Never go away and l eave it heating. It dissolves fast. Stay and stir until dissolved. Step 4 : The liquid should be yellow and clear. Pour into the pitcher and then use the pitcher to pour into your plastic container with a lid. Put the lid on and set aside to cool. Warning: when the MMS is spilled on a table or on the floor it must be cleaned up with plenty of water. Never allow it to dry. The white powder is very flammable when dry. Step 5 : Purchase a dark colored bottle or a number of smal l colored bottles and transfer from your original bottle if i t is not a dark bottle. Make up labels with the following data on them and glue the labels on the bottles. You can use your computer for maki ng the labels. The MMS lasts for several years. It should have ma ximum data on the label for someone a couple of years from now wh o might want to use it. For example, if a hurricane damaged much o f your home and help was days away, if the bottle had proper inform ation it could be used to help you or save your life.

One gallon of distilled water or you can use pur ified water if it says, “For all distilled water purposes.” Do not use any othe r kind of water. Do not use spring water or mineral water unless it is an e xtreme emergency. 3. A plastic pitcher that has a small pouring spout . Use the tall pitchers. Check the spout to see that it will pour into the M MS bottle easily. Or use a coffee maker glass pitcher for pouring the MMS into the bottles. Do not use a funnel for pouring into the MMS bottle. It uses up too much time. Fill each bottle to the top. Do not leave any air room in the top of the bottle. This is so it won’t splash during shipping and worr y the postal workers, or even worse the airline workers. 4. A four quart pan that can be heated to be used f or dissolving the salts. Use only glass or Teflon coated steel. The Teflon coat must not be scratched through to metal. Do not use stainless s teel or aluminum. You could make a poisonous MMS if you use metal for dis solving the Salts. That would be a disaster. If you use stainless steel you will notice that the MMS discolors the metal. That’s because it is dissolvi ng the steel out of the other metals. Do not bottle such a solution. Corning Ware is also okay to use. 5. Fifteen four ounce colored empty bottles.

A cardboard box approximately two feet high. Cut a slot into the top of the box so that the MMS bottle will lie in the slot, but not fall through. Put a mark on the box near the top of the label where it will stick onto the bottle.

Because without automatic machines, pealing l abels off of their backing and sticking them on the bottles takes ten times as much time as it takes to simply spray labels with the 3M spray and then stick them on the bottles. After you cut them out spray six labels at a time and stick them on. It takes less time than it takes to remove labels f rom their backing.

Not a real cooler, cerami c or plastic holder of the type where a 5 gallon water jug is turned upside d own on. There is a water spigot for turning the water off and on near the bottom The procedure: The MMS is 28% Salts by weight. The Salts are a po wder that are dissolved in distilled water. So keep in mind that the MMS will be 28% Salts. This is what makes it so much more heavier than water. Do not make a mistake here. People’s lives depend upon it . Just follow the instructions below and you will get it right. Step 1 . Fill one freezer bag with 632.8grams of salts. (This is the point where you fill one bag for 13 four ounce bottles, o r you fill 10 freezer bags for 130 four ounce bottles.) Zip the bag closed and store in a clean dry place at room temperature. Mark on the bag “632.8 Grams of Sodium Chlorite” and put the date. This is a temporary st ep, but who knows what might happen to make you forget what is in the bag. Step 2 . Measure out 1,627.2 grams of distilled water (tha t’s 57.6 ounces) and put it in an empty juice bottle and mark the le vel with a black marking pen. If you are making more than 13 initial four o unce bottles you will be using this same amount of distilled water for each group of 13 four ounce bottles. This is your water measuring bottle . Step 3 . Put the four quart nonmetal heating pan on the bu rner and pour the distilled water from the water measuring bottle into the pan. Do not let it boil. Keep the temperature well under boiling. One hundred fifty degrees is plenty hot. Step 4 . Once the water is warm, dump the contents of the freezer bags made in Step 1 into the heating pan with the water. Stir it constantly until all of the salts are dissolved. The solution will be slightly yellow and foggy. This is normal. The pan will be less than ½ full. Remove the heating pan See Chapter 20, page 6 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"Making 13 or 1300 Bottles of MMS in Your Kitchen Ch 17 Page 5 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century with the solution from the burner. This solution n ow weighs 80 ounces. The solution will turn clear but yellow within seve ral minutes, but so long as all of the salts have been dissolved you can procee d to step 5. Step 5. Set the 64 ounce juice bottle into a plastic conta iner or another non metallic pan. Use the large funnel. Pour the cont ents of the heated pan into the 64 ounce juice bottle. Although the solut ion at this time weighs 80 ounces it will fit into one of the 64 ounce juice b ottles. The additional pan is to prevent you from spilling the MMS. Keep in m ind that if the MMS gets spilled it makes a mess. If it dries, it makes a w hite powder that will burn or explode. There is not enough to cause damage from explosion, but if it starts a fire there could be a lot of damage. Do n ot spill the MMS. If you spill it, wipe it up and then wash the spot with pl enty of water. Step 6 . Write on the bottle “MMS” and the date created w ith the black marker pen. Leave room for the next time you use the bottle. Remember, you cannot leave the MMS in the clear bottles for very long. Generally not longer than one week. The light, even just room light begins to deteriorate the solution in the bottles. This step is just a temporary step in the process of making MMS. Filling the four ounce MMS bottles. Note: Do not put labels on empty bottles. Wait unt il the bottles are full and closed before adding labels, because any spilled so lution ruins the label.

Take the 64 ounce MMS juice bottle and open it . Using the plastic pitcher with the small pour spout, or the coffee ma ker pitcher pour in enough MMS to fill about five MMS bottles. Don’t me asure this, just pour it 1/4 full or so. Step 1A. Alternately, pour the entire contents of all of the 64 ounce MMS juice bottles that you have made up into the water cooler unit described in 16 above. Use the spigot to fill all of the green bottles that you have up to 100. It’s best not to have more than 100 bottles w ithout lids at one time. Go to step 3. Step 2. Set one 4 ounce colored MMS bottle in a sma ll bowl and carefully fill it with the plastic pitcher. Fill each bottle almost full and then set them in a row on the table. Do not do more than 13 bottles at a time. When you have 13 bottles in a row, use a small pitcher or ot her tiny jar to finish filling each bottle. Completely fill each bottle, leaving no air at the top. Step 3. Install tops on each of the green four oun ce MMS bottles. Do this by holding each cap on its side and dropping a sing le drop of super glue on the threads of the cap and then turn the cap onto t he bottle. Tighten the cap as tight as you can by hand using something lik e a towel on the cap to help you tighten it. A towel works best, do not us e a pliers. After an hour, the caps should be impossible to remove by hand. C aps closed by using pliers usually are too tight and they begin to leak . Step 4. After the top is tightened on each bottle , grasp the bottle in your hand and squeeze it as hard as you can. Look for l eaks. Drops of liquid will drop off the bottle normally if there is a lea k. In rare cases a fine spray or stream might come off the bottom of the bottle. You need plenty of light to see the fine spray. Normally there will only be one or two leaking bottles per 100 bottles, but it is important that you find any leaks as one bottle can foul up an entire shipment. Step 5. Keep the bottles in a clean dry place. It is ok to keep bottles at normal room light but do not allow them to set in t he sun. Step 6. Adding the Labels: (See “Making the Labels” below) Take six labels and lay them face down on a sheet of newspaper. Sp ray the labels with See Chapter 20, page 6 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Making 13 or 1300 Bottles of MMS in Your Kitchen Ch 17 Page 7 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century 3M Super 77 adhesive. Don’t attempt to do more tha n six at a time as the adhesive tends to dry and if you use more than six the last labels will be too dry to stick. If they do dry, re-spray those that have dried before attempting to stick them on the bottles. Step 7. Place one of the filled bottles in the slot on the cardboard box that you have already prepared. (See item #9 under “What you will need” at the beginning of these instructions) Pick up a sing le label that has been sprayed with adhesive, hold it over the bottle near the mark that you have made, adjust it by eye to be straight, and press it down on the bottle. Smooth the label on the bottle with your hand. Be sure to push it down tight. Step 8. Do steps 7 and 8 on all of the bottles, do ing six at a time. Step 9. Preparing the bottles to be shipped : Using a one quart plastic freezer storage bags, place two green MMS bottles i n the bag laying them down in the bottom of the bag. Wrap the top of the bag around the two bottles, close the zip lock making sure it is tight , and place a rubber band around the bag and bottles to hold them in place. Now put the bottles in the bag into another bag and close it. If they leak in shipment the liquid will hopefully remain in one of the bags. Step 10. Do Step 9 until all bottles to be shipped are ready. This prevents problems of leaking bottles when shipping. A singl e leaking bottle can stop an entire shipment preventing the treatment of hund reds of people. Be very careful. Step 11. Have them boxed for shipping . Unless you are very good at doing shipping, do not try to box them yourself. K eep in mind this shipment is of utmost importance. Don’t take chanc es. When at the shipping store, don’t take chances to save money on the packaging. Have it done as best as possible. From the shipping sto re take the box to FedEx or DHL for shipping. Making the Labels: 1. Most draw programs have provisions for making la bels. Otherwise you See Chapter 20, page 6 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Making 13 or 1300 Bottles of MMS in Your Kitchen Ch 17 Page 8 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century can buy a cheap label program. Normally you would use the program to set up a single label as shown with this literature and then the label program will automatically make a number of labels dependin g upon the labels that you select. In this case select a label that has e ight per page. That will give you approximately the correct size of label when cu t out. Or duplicate the label given below. 2. Buy good paper. Pay $8 to $10 a ream. Don’t us e photo paper. Photo paper is very expensive, and it is heavy making the edges curl up easily. Print the labels on the computer.

Pet really stands for polyethylene terep hthalate, but no one ever uses the actual words. Everyone uses the words “pet plastic bottles” and won't have a clue if you use the actua l words. So use pet plastic bottles for your search word and that will show you hundreds of companies sell plastic bottles. Be sure to always buy dark plastic as light will cause the solution to deteriorate. The plasti c can be “see through” so long as it is very dark. On the Internet the company sks-bottle.com in New Y ork is one company. You can use any other company that you wish so long as the caps have near the same size dropper as the sks-bottle caps d o. See chapter 10 for the exact measurements. These caps are sold by man y different companies. See below for the exact stock number fo r the caps. Be sure that the caps fit the bottles that you purchase.

You might be able to find a local business that will receive the sodium chlorite for you and let you use their name for this purpose or just order it for you. Alternately, you could just buy a resale number from your city. Finding industrial sources for 100 pound drums is a little harder than buying lab supplies. Go to Google and put in “Drin king water chemicals,” or “drinking water treatment chemicals.” Of course , use Google for the country you are in. Most countries will have sodiu m chlorite for water purification. Or look up NSF on the Internet or NSF /ANSI Standard 60. This is an association which many companies that se ll sodium chlorite belong to. Just start calling the various companie s that sell sodium chlorite for water purification. You will eventually find o ne that will sell you the 100 pound barrel between $250 and $400. Then it will c ost you about $150 shipping because it is a hazardous chemical. But r emember, with that barrel of 100 pounds you can make 500,000 doses. T hat is approximately 1/10 cent per dose. At a last minute decision, on my way south to publi sh this book, I managed to buy a 100 pound barrel of sodium chlorite from t he Los Angeles Chemical Company of Los Angeles, California for the price of $278.00. The lowest price so far. I picked this barrel up a t their Las Vegas division. Since I picked it up myself there was no shipping c osts. They will not sell to an individual. You must be registered with them as a company. I formed a small company in a Nevada town and then called them to order a barrel. They put my company in their data base when I calle d them up. They then ordered the barrel for me and told me it would be a vailable at their location in Las Vegas the next week. There was no problem.

A certain amount of humanitarian work has already b een done, but it is not enough. It isn’t even a drop in the bucket. Much more has got to be done to change Africa and thus change the wor ld. Why change Africa? The facts are, the industrial n ations spend untold billions of humanitarian dollars in Africa e ach year. It’s untold because no one knows how much, but it is tremendous . Go to any city in Africa and you will see numerous nonprofit NGO’s (Non Governmental Organizations) there spending money do ing humanitarian work. The Red Cross is there, the Worl d Health Organization, World Vision, USAID, Doctors Without Borders, Global Fund, City of Hope, and dozens of others exi st in almost every city in Africa . Why all the money spent? Why are they so far behin d us? Africa is right on the equator. It is mostly warm and a very good environment for disease. Just malaria alone sickens 500,000,00 0 people each year. When people are sick, they can’t work. They can’t plant the crops, or harvest them when the time comes. They c an’t build houses or produce wheel barrows. In other words, w ith sickness, nothing much gets done. It isn’t that they are laz y, nor is it because they are uncivilized. It’s simple. When 500,000,00 0 people get sick, you have that many who can’t work, and it then requ ires almost that See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"The Humanitarian Project  Chapter 18 Page 2 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century many to take care of them. It takes much of the re sources to just take care of those who are sick. When I was young I always heard that Africa was so far behind us because they weren’t civilized or because they are always fighting, or because they are lazy. But the fact is, as I state d in the above paragraph, when you are sick you simply can’t work. The situation is that their country has problems that the rest of th e world has never had. As part of the human race it is our job to he lp them solve those problems. If you don’t feel sorry for them, that’s okay, and if you don’t feel responsible for them, that’s okay. But the fact is, we, as part of the human race cannot afford to ignore them . The disease that will kill the entire human race may be ferment ing there now. Or the man that saves the human race may be being born there now. One thing is certain, the human race cannot afford to not confront either of these possibilities. If the human race i s to survive on this planet for any reasonable time, we cannot let any p roblem go unchecked. When you hear someone talking about any country or continent taking responsibility for their own situation, you should stop and think. We are the people of Planet Earth. It’s up to us to take responsibility for our own situation and that inclu des the fact that we must solve the African problem if we expect to feel safe at all. It’s amazing, but we can cure the majority of the p overty in the world merely by furnishing a cure for malaria. That won’ t cure all of the poverty, but a whole lot of it. Then if we can cure AIDS, we will also cure a lot more poverty. This money that would the n ordinarily would go to Africa could stay here to build a space program, or greater roads, or more training for our poor. And one more thing, if we treat all of Africa the h uman race will be taking one giant step towards survival. If we don’ t work to help one another in this way, the human race will eventually cease to exist on this planet. Since this planet came into existence there has been See Chapter 8, page 15 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"The Humanitarian Project  Chapter 18 Page 3 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century more than 50 catastrophes that would have destroyed all of mankind had we been here when they happened. We are here n ow, and such a catastrophe is due to happen again. One of the pl aces that the money that we will save when we don’t have to spend billions on Africa can go toward preparing for the next catastr ophe. If we don’t, the human race is condemned to extinction. The next catastrophe will happen, there is no doubt of that. It’s impossible to think that it will not happen, it’s just when will it happen? It could easily be tomorrow, or it could be 25,000 years from now, but it will happen. If we are not ready, that’s the end of the human ra ce. There are a lot of reasons to help those who really need it in the world, but probably the greatest reason is the bene fit that the helper receives. When an individual has no reason for hel ping or aiding others, he is that way because he is solely interes ted in himself and his immediate family and goals. Do you see that no t only narrows his play field and his interests, but it narrows hi s thinking. When hard times come, his thinking will still be narrowe d. He won’t have the broad prospectus that might be required for sur vival. And that’s only a small part of it. When one begins to think about others the mental area in his mind broadens. His interests br oadens. His enjoyment of life changes. He understands others b etter, and thus his life is easier because of it. A person who rem ains interested in only his family and his goals only knows his small area of the world. His world is very small. When he becomes intereste d in others and their problems his thinking broadens greatly. The world that exists within his mind expands. He has more data that he c an include in his thinking and his problem solving. Life for him is better and life for humanity is a bit better because of his broadened o utlook. This is a reason for helping mankind, and anything you do for others is helping mankind. Your life will be better becau se of anything you do in that arena.

Furthermore, many of them do not trust the drugs th at are supposed to cure them enough to spend the little money that they have on them. Thus, in the beginning our treatment must be free or it simply won’t happen. Once we have picked a country that will accept us w e will need to buy a compound from which the operation can be cond ucted. Several clinics would be set up in the local area w here anyone could come for a dose of MMS. Then a number of vehicles would be purchased. There would be one MMS trained member f or each vehicle. Local individuals would be hired, two for each vehicle. In the beginning they would be trained by the MMS memb ers. The vehicles would travel out to the villages deliverin g the MMS solution and training the village chief and other members ho w to dispense the MMS solution. Local people work in Africa for $30 to $40 a month. They would be trained quickly to deliver the MMS solution and to train the villagers. Then probably in each country a manufacturing plant would be set up in the MMS compound. This would save a great de al of cost as the main cost so far has been shipping of the solut ion. The actual cost is less than one cent per dose, but the shippi ng increases the cost considerably. As more people were trained more delivery cars woul d be purchased. Each car would have a route to follow. There would be trained people in each car to continue to make sure that th e villagers know how to use the Solution. With the proper money, th e expansion of cars and trained people would go fast as it takes o nly about three weeks to train an individual in the dispensing of t he MMS solution.

There is a nonprofit organization that has formed w hat they call a World Healing Initiative. They are working to make the MMS and holistic health care available to the poor of the w orld.

They are working to create the W orld Healing Initiative through which any and all nonprofit orga nizations and private individuals can unite to bring about this s tated purpose.

They feel and I feel that over a period of time this will help convince the world that the MMS work s and thus help it be distributed to the millions who need it. You ca n find their Web Site at www.FAWT.org. There is a point, I don’t know how many people need to know, but a point can be reached which I call the point of no r eturn.

In the 20 th century more people were murdered and killed than all the centur ies before. God didn’t save those hundreds of millions of people wh o were shot, or burned, or blown to bits.

In that case you really will be doing something to help mankind. One more thing I wanted to mention. Please learn t o make the MMS and save some of the sodium chlorite powder somewhe re, at least for your family. It won’t always be available. On the other hand, make lots of it and sell it when you can. Make some mon ey, because there will be a big demand for it eventually, and if you have it you will be able to sell it. Few people realize at this time t hat when most of the people in the US can either make it or get there ha nds one it, most of the power of the FDA will be broken. The FDA basis most of their power on their ability to stop things that will dec rease the income of the major pharmaceuticals.

Then probably in each country a manufacturing plant would be set up in the MMS compound. This would save a great de al of cost as the main cost so far has been shipping of the solut ion. The actual cost is less than one cent per dose, but the shippi ng increases the cost considerably. As more people were trained more delivery cars woul d be purchased. Each car would have a route to follow. There would be trained people in each car to continue to make sure that th e villagers know how to use the Solution. With the proper money, th e expansion of cars and trained people would go fast as it takes o nly about three weeks to train an individual in the dispensing of t he MMS solution.

This is the most effective medicine that has ever been invented up to this time. We must know what is the maximum dose for every kind of disease that exists. We must know when to use it intravenously and when not to. We must know when i t will cure cancer and when it will not. We must know if there are any bacterial diseases or virus diseases that it is not effective against and why. We only know, at this point, that it cures many things . The amount of knowledge is a tiny bit of what we should know. Anyone interested in research should contact me. U p to this point I have the most experience with the MMS, however, the re is no doubt that many medical men will know more about it than me after I describe what I know to them. Medical men and alte rnate medicine people need to begin working with it, as many lives can be saved and much suffering can be alleviated. I am definitely willing to tell all I can to anyone doing research. The drug companies have a great deal of technology that could be used with the MMS. One important research would be to develop carriers that can carry the chlorine dioxide deeper into the body before it is released. Thus possibly getting to so me of those incurable disease that have not been touched so far (so far a s we know). However, the chances of getting the drug companies to do such a thing is very slim.

Then drink immediately. (A longer than three minute wait, up to ½ hour is okay.) Vinegar: Any kind of vinegar is okay as long as it says at least 5% acetic acid. We have always used ¼ to ½ teaspoon w ith up to 6 drops. When using more than 6 drops use more than ¼ teaspoon. Lemon Juice : Lemon juice can be used. Generally use 5 drops t o each one drops of MMS. Citric Acid : I believe at this time that citric acid is the m ost effective, but we need more data. Mix the citric acid 1 to 10 with water. That’s a 10% citric acid solution. One way to make it is to use a level tablespoon full of citric acid in a glass and then add 9 tablespoonfuls of water. When using this 10% citric acid solution , use 5 drops for each one drop of MMS. Juice: Use Apple juice, grape juice, pineapple juice, or c ranberry juice. The juice must not have Vitamin C added, I t prevents the activation. Read the label carefully, or make fres h juice.

Work up to six drops once a day, twice a week for young people; six drops once every day for olde r people. Always use the vinegar or the citric acid or lemon, 3 minu te wait, and juice. Most people can start right off at six drops a day and do not need to work up to it. Only a very few will feel any nause a from six drops. ( 2) For most diseases especially liver diseases, an d including other problems: Start with two drops or less if one is very sick. Give the first dose, wait one hour and give a second dose. If you don’t notice an increase in nausea, go to three drops four hours later. The next day start with three drops in the morning and give a second dose in one or two hours. Then go to four drops in the afte r noon or evening before bed. Continue increasing the drops each mor ning doing a second dose in about one hour and a single dose in the afternoon or evening until you are taking 15 drops three times a day. Anytime you notice nausea, reduce the drops, but go to 15 d rops as soon as possible. Take the drops after a meal to help preve nt nausea. A healthy person experiences no nausea, but do not be afraid of nausea, as it only indicates that the MMS is workin g. Try to prevent nausea in those you treat because it scares them an d makes them refuse further treatment. Remember always use the acids and the 3 minute wait. Vomiting and diarrhea are a part of getting well in many cases. If you body needs either one of them, it will do it. However it is always very short lived. Your body knows.

(3) For malaria and other parasite diseases use 15 drops the very first dose. Wait one to two hours and give another 15 dr ops. Do the same the next day. Continue for 3 days. Check for parasites. If parasites are present, continue up to three months. All parasites will be dead long before three months. Remember, always use the vinegar, wait, and juice. In most cases parasites in cluding worms will be dead in three days. Malaria normally clear s up in 4 hours or less. ( 4) Snake bite, take at least 15 drop doses every ½ hour for two hours, and then every hour for two hours, and then every two hours. Continue every four hours until you are out of dang er. As usual, use the vinegar, wait, and juice. Do not cut a snake b ite in any case. Be sure to see a doctor, but do not allow him to cut t he snake bite. It’s okay to use a suction device on the bite. Cutting spreads the poison too fast. (5) Burns, 1 st , 2 nd , or 3 rd degree burns : Do not use vinegar. Squirt the MMS directly on the burn full strength from the bottle. Make sure it covers the burn. Wait no longer than 60 seconds and then wash the MMS off with water. It’s very good to use to stop pain and burning for sunburns, but WARNING, do not leave on more than 30 seconds. It must be washed off.

The Miracle Mineral Supplement Contents is bottled at 28% sodium chlorite powder and distilled water. It is a clear slightly yellow solution. Small amounts appear totally clear with no yellow showing. Sodium Chlorite Powder is only 80% sodium chlorite. The balance is mostly table salt with less than 1% other nontox ic sodium chemicals. The amount of sodium in any dose is not enough to consider harmful to any diet. Because sodium chlor ite powder is always only 80% pure sodium chlorite the actual amo unt of pure sodium chlorite in the MMS solution is 22.4%. Sodium chlorite in a six drop dose: There are 54 mg of sodium chlorite in a six drop dose of MMS and about 10 mg of salt. Not enough to count during any one day. Sodium dioxide is also generated. There is one to two milligrams generate d initially by the vinegar, and then one to two mg per hour are genera ted as the chlorine dioxide degenerates into table salt and wa ter. Chlorine dioxide: 12 drops of MMS with the added vinegar generates from 1 to 2 mg of chlorine dioxide. When it is dil uted with ½ glass of juice there is less than 1 ppm in the solution. (Th ere are still 1 to 2 See page 6 of this chapter for data on obtaining MM S"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"Basic Details for using the MMS  Chapter 20 Page 5 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century milligrams that goes into the body, but 1 ppm is le ss than what is acceptable in some foods by FDA guidelines). The M MS solution then continues to generate 1 to 2 milligrams per ho ur of chlorine dioxide for up to 12 hours in the human body. Chlorine Dioxide : The American Chemical Society, Analytical Chemistry Division stated in 1999 that chlorine dio xide is the most powerful killer of pathogens known to man. Chlorine dioxide is used in many industrial processes. It has been used to sterilize food products such as red meat and poultry for over 50 y ears. It is used in hospitals and clinics as a sterilizing agent. Buying Sodium Chlorite: See 2 nd part of chapter 16. Formula for Sodium Chlorite: NaClO 2 . Na=Sodium Cl=chlorine and O 2 =Oxygen (The O 2 in all cases here merely indicates that two atoms of oxygen exist. It is not an indication of the charge.) The actual charge on the oxygen is -2 (minus two) which leaves the oxygen in the neutral condition. It’s the same cha rge as the oxygen in carbon dioxide. It can’t be used for oxidation. Formula for Chlorine Dioxide: ClO 2. You can observe that just the Na (sodium) has been removed to make the chlorine d ioxide. The O 2 is two oxygen ions with a charge of two electrons each. That is considered minus two (-2) because electrons have a negative charge. Oxygen ions at this charge cannot oxidize anything and thus are not available to the body for oxidization. The Cl stand s for chlorine which is a chlorine ion in this case with a positiv e charge until it oxidizes and destroys something in which case it wi nds up with a negative charge as well. It then is a chloride whi ch is the same as chloride in table salt. It cannot do further react ions. Formula for Oxygen: O 2 That means that an oxygen molecule consists of two oxygen atoms that are bound togethe r. The oxygen enters the body for the purpose of oxidation in the elemental state. When it oxidizes various items in the body it relea ses energy creating See page 6 of this chapter for data on obtaining MM S"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Basic Details for using the MMS  Chapter 20 Page 6 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century the warmth of the body. During the oxidization pro cess the oxygen atoms are charged to -2 (minus two) electrons. The y are then oxygen ions. They have reached their neutral state . In the neutral state (minus 2 electron charge) they cannot be used by the body. In this state they form carbon dioxide and are expelle d from the body as one breathes out. They are then recharged by gr een trees and other green plants. The oxygen ions that are attached to chlorine dioxi de, like carbon dioxide, have a minus two electron charge and thus are neutral. The body cannot use them. They either form carbon diox ide, or they become part of the water of the body. Oxidation : In the old days of chemistry, it was thought that oxygen was the only thing that oxidized metal, other chemi cals and things. But as a better understanding of chemistry came abo ut it was soon learned that any element or ion or molecule that ac cepted electrons was basically the same oxidization process that oxy gen created. Oxygen accepts electrons from other elements or mol ecules and at the same time causing the release of some energy in the form of heat. That’s oxidization. Well so do many other elements , molecules and ions accept electrons and release energy. Oxygen b ecomes neutral and can accept no more electrons when it has reache d the charge of minus two electrons. However, a chlorine dioxide m olecule can accept 5 electrons, at a much higher energy exchang e. Thus it also oxidizes, but with much more whamo. Oxygen when ne utralized by a minus two charge normally leaves the body as carb on dioxide. That means that carbon dioxide has two ions of oxyg en, but neutralized oxygen. The two oxygen ions are then c harged back to their elemental state by green plants and the sun a gain making them available to create oxidization in the body.

I almost didn’t write this chapter because this boo k is about MMS, but this information is something that everyone who is interested in health should know. It also gives a little more da ta about the FDA. Let me first make a few statements that are undispu table facts, provable in court of law and by a hundred different sources including the Internet. The data I am going to tell you is a bsolutely undisputable, yet most people ignore it. The first thing you should know is that most of the FDA experts are also on the payroll of the pharmaceutical companies . You would think that would be against public policy. But no, it seems that they have the right to moonlight just like anyone else, even if it is counter productive. Should you want the facts on this, rea d the book Deadly Medicine by Thomas Moore. Secondly, in 1992 the FDA started a public campaign to deny the America people the right to purchase vitamins witho ut going to a doctor and obtaining a prescription. They spent mi llions of dollars of taxpayers’ money pushing this cause, but it didn’t work. Worse than that, it backfired against them. Not just thousands but millions of American people arose up against this attack on our liberty and wrote their congressmen. In August of 1994 congres ses fixed their wagon on this score attempting to do it permanently , but that evidently wasn’t possible. A law was passed unanim ously by both See Chapter 20, page 6 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"Heart Attacks, What Causes Them and the FDA Chapter 21 Page 2 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century houses and signed into law by the president. Did y ou see that? Unanimously. That’s what the America people can do if they rea lly try. (All of this is now a matter of public record s). The law was called DSHEA (The Dietary Supplement He alth and Education Act of 1994). This law attempts to guara ntee the American people free access to vitamins and other e ssential nutrients and to the educational data concerning these nutrie nts. The reason why the educational data was included is that the p harmaceutical companies had been campaigning to prevent any and a ll claims of health benefits concerning vitamins from being publ ished. Do you see? They would have even prevented books from bei ng printed telling us about vitamins. They spent not just mil lions, but billions on this idea. Now we have a law to protect us. The C onstitution should have been enough, but we need all the help we can g et. But that still wasn’t enough. The pharmaceutical co mpanies banded together to form a cartel at the international leve l. They started a world wide campaign to ban all data concerning the health benefits of vitamins and minerals and other natural substanc es from being distributed anywhere in the world. They approached the world through the United Nations Food Standards Commissio n. They thought that they could force the industrial nation s and the world to accept vitamins as prescription medicine. Disguise d as a consumer protection initiative, this concept was to be recom mended to the UN General Assembly. There were to be trade sanctions on any countries that refused to accept vitamins as prescr iption medicine. That was the year of 1997. The main actor in this pharmaceutical vitamin cartel was the German government. Germany exports more pharmaceutical products than any other nation. The y might have succeeded except for one doctor, Matthias Rath, M. D. On June 22, 1997, he gave a speech to an audience in Chemnitz, Germany. He exposed the cartel and their intentions in that spe ech and connected them to the pharmaceutical companies who were profi teers of World War II and even the Holocaust. As a result of this speech and several See Chapter 20, page 6 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"Heart Attacks, What Causes Them and the FDA Chapter 21 Page 3 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century other speeches and hundreds of thousands of protest letters, the idea was so controversial by the time it was to be prese nted to the UN General Assembly that they did not succeed. Even bigger than that, May 20, 1999 these multinati onal pharmaceutical companies admitted to forming a “Vit amin-Cartel” to fix the prices of raw vitamins and materials. They defrauded hundreds of millions of people world wide of more t han 100 billion dollars. They were fined about one billion dollars . The U.S. Justice Department declared that they were the largest ille gal cartel ever uncovered. This tiny fine in reference to the tota l amount they bilked from the people of the world was inconsequential. Are you starting to see? The pharmaceutical compan ies have no conscience. They will do anything to prevent a los s of money or to make money. They care not how many deaths that the y cause. The pharmaceutical companies through the FDA have suppr essed dozens of discoveries concerning cures for cancer, heart disease and many other diseases for more than 50 years. I know that you probably think that is crazy, but so would you think that ab out the above information if it were not so much a part of the re cord. There is nothing that I have said above that can be disputed . It’s all a matter of record. It all happened just as stated above an d can be investigated by any high school student and proven to be facts. The proof of the suppression of the discoveries of cure s for cancer and other diseases are slightly more covered up at this time, but still quite provable. The FDA has depended upon the incredibil ity of what they have done and the indifference of the public t o maintain their farce. One other story of facts. The amino acid Tryptopha n was sold in health food stores throughout the US as an aid for sleep. It really worked, and thousands of people bought it as oppose d to several drug sleep aids. Tryptophan replaced several milli ons of dollars that the drug companies were no longer able to sell. Th en guess what, Tryptophan evidently caused the death of one person in the US and See Chapter 20, page 6 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"Heart Attacks, What Causes Them and the FDA Chapter 21 Page 4 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century several in Japan. The FDA immediately took it off the shelf of every health food store in the US. This amino acid is ma nufactured in Japan and it was found that somehow an impurity had gotten into the amino acid jar. Although the problem was fixed and acceptable purity rules were put in place in the Japanese manu facturing plant, it was never allow back in the US. It was later found that American FDA agents had vis ited the Japanese Tryptophan plant before the impure jars of Tryptophan were shipped. So now drug companies that sell slee p drugs make millions of dollars selling the drugs that replace the Tryptophan. Do you see? One person dead from amino acid impuritie s and America can no longer have Tryptophan, but hundreds of thou sands of people are dead from drugs and that is completely a cceptable. Am I the only one that sees something wrong with that? It can now be shown to any researcher that every pe rson in America is in someway personally touched by suffering and d eath as a result of the FDA’s betrayal of the American people. But worse than that every person in the world is to some extent affecte d by the suppression of data for the cure of many different diseases. The indifference results mostly from realizing that one can really do nothing to change the status quo. But now that can be changed simply by everyone informing his relatives, friends and neighbors of this book. You may think that law I mention earlier in this ch apter the DSHEA of 1994 has protected us. Well, not so. As soon a s it was out of the public eye the FDA has convinced the congress to pa ss a law saying that all supplements must be approved by the FDA be fore sales in the US. Now the FDA has publicly stated that they intend to shut down 50% of the supplement business in the US using this new law. Now with 970,000 drug related deaths each year and not even one single supplement related death per year in the ent ire health food field the FDA is going to limit our right to have s upplements unless they approve of them. They are not fooling around. They have See Chapter 20, page 6 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"Heart Attacks, What Causes Them and the FDA Chapter 21 Page 5 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century stated their intention to enforce this new law with vengeance.

There is only one reason why they would have agreed to this law in both the house and senate. T hey are bought and paid for. These laws were put through fast bef ore the America people could find out about them. About the FDA suppression of cures: I am going desc ribe two of the more important suppression incidents below and then tell you where you can check my data for accuracy. Be advised, ho wever, I am only hitting the top of the iceberg. There are man y more cases that I do not have time and space to cover. You can also see why I moved out of the country to publish this book. Now you a re going to say, “But the constitution of the U.S. allows you to pub lish anything.” Well, the FDA doesn’t care about that. They arrest such authors and scientist inventors and charge them with almost any thing. But they don’t care. They can keep an author in jail for a long time on trumped up charges. The judges in that area of the law are FDA judges. They keep saying that if the author will wi thdraw his book or say his cure doesn’t work they will withdraw the ch arges. By the time the author has spent all his money on lawyers he of ten gives in. Dozens of cures have been lost because the inventor or author just was too tired of fighting to go on, and he died of a heart attack, or he did spend years in jail. Actually, it’s a lot worse than just that. They se ize property and destroy businesses. They often take everything tha t is in a business including the car and bank account. Many times the y do it without a search warrant. They destroy a person’s life. Duri ng the trial they have their own judges who will not allow any reason able defense. A hero who has spent his life helping people and sear ching for a cure to one disease or another can find himself in prison f or years. These incidents are a crime of the worst kind against hum anity. They destroy the business and a person’s whole life to s uppress a cure. They do it in the name of public safety and no one can stop them.

They do it for the billion s of dollars that the pharmaceutical companies will make if the cure is n ot given to the public through out the world. It often scares cler ks about their jobs. If a cure is found for cancer, thousands of jobs wi ll be lost. Radiation therapy jobs will be lost and chemotherapy drugs wi ll no longer be manufactured. Hospitals will go out of business. But millions of lives will be saved and untold suffering will be stopped. Would you rather save the jobs, or stop the suffering and then have those people retrained for other jobs? I do not have nearly enough money to publish this b ook widely, but I am depending upon the American people, the Mexican people, and the People of South America to get this data out. If everyone will send this book to at least two people, or at lease see that at least two people download the free ebook Part 1 from www.miraclemineral.org, the America people will hav e a cure that will eliminate more than 50% and as much as 80% of the drugs consumed by mankind at this time. In the long-run millions of lives will be saved and the suffering that will be stoppe d is incalculable. If you have read this book you know that this is true, and if you don’t know that it is true then give MMS a try. It cures cancer when used properly or used with other know cancer cures such as the Indian Herb mixture. And as I have said all profits from the book will be used by me to distribute this book in the world or in Africa to bring this cure to the African people. I have got to be careful with what I say, or they will prosecute me on something like th is. So let me say that is my intension at this time and I will do my best to carry it out, but I cannot guarantee that all profit will go that way for absolute certain at this time. Billions and billions of dollars have been spent on the search for a cure for cancer by using the present theory of canc er. For more than a hundred years there have been two basic theories of cancer. The other theory has been suppressed. Lives have been destroyed, people have been jailed and sent to prison, books h ave been burned. See Chapter 20, page 6 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"Heart Attacks, What Causes Them and the FDA Chapter 21 Page 7 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century Every conceivable discussing thing that can be done has been done to prevent the second theory of cancer from ever co ming to scientific light or becoming know to the public. Funny thing, all of the demonstrated cures of cancer have been based on the second theory, or similar concepts. More than two dozen or more o f those cures have each had more than one thousand documented cas es of complete cures from cancer, some of them more than 10,000 documented cures and several more than 100,000 case s recorded. So let me tell you in a few nontechnical sentences the difference between the two different theories of cancer. The present theory of cancer is that healthy body cells for some unknown reason mutate into cancerous cells. The general idea is that the unknown reason is aging, poor diet, heredity, a bad condition that s lowly mutates into cancer, or something along those lines. Using this theory, billions of dollars have been spent on research and millions of men, women and children have suffered and died for more than 1 00 years while no significant improvement in cancer treatment has happened. That’s 100 years without an answer or even a real i mprovement. Of course there are a lot of scientists that would lik e to argue against that. There was what they call a great improvement in the chemotherapy chemicals in about 1948 but there is s till more people dying of cancer than ever. There is no indication that chemotherapy increases one’s chances of living. Does that seem like a poor picture to you? The sam e treatment for over a 100 years and no real change in the treatmen t for more than 100 years and they still use it and research it, an d still a higher percentage are dying of cancer than ever before. The second theory which is the unaccepted theory of cancer is that cancer is caused by a very unusual virus that chang es its size and shape from a virus to a bacteria and back to a viru s again. There are a lot of technical terms I am missing, but that’s t he basic concept. This second theory is called pleomorphism. Researc h into this theory is not allowed. You may say, “I thought America wa s a free See Chapter 20, page 6 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"Heart Attacks, What Causes Them and the FDA Chapter 21 Page 8 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century country.” Well, that’s so, but not to those who wa nt to do research into this particular theory of cancer. No money is available for such research, and those who try hit a blank wall. Nobo dy cooperates with them. Their colleagues won’t talk to them any more. The FDA, FTC and the AMA put every possible stop in their wa y that they can find. Let me say again, all the suppressed cures t hat have worked have been based on this very unusual virus theory o r similar concepts. Please, please, please, don’t believe me. Go to th e Internet and dig deep enough to find the facts. The facts are there , and when you have facts you can prove them. There is always pro of somewhere there, often hidden but uncoverable. We need milli ons of more people who know the facts. They don’t have to be t echnical; they just need to know what is really going on. So let m e tell you one book to read to get you started. It’s The Cancer Cure that Worked by Barry Lynes and John Crane. They give reference s and tell where you can go to get the actual records. In this book we are talking about MMS. So far many people have stated that after taking the MMS that their cancer went away. MMS kills viruses and bacteria. It has been establishe d for 100 years that chlorine dioxide kills viruses and bacteria. We ha ve not proven that MMS will attack mutated cancerous cells. But what has happened is that skin cancer including melanoma dries up and fl akes off like the scab of a sore. It doesn’t look like the cancer wa s attacked; it looks more like the cancer just quit growing and the body simply healed the area. That’s what would have happened if the v irus were killed. Well, we don’t know do we? Yet. Here is one more thing that the FDA really doesn’t want you to know. Heart attacks have nothing to do with choles terol levels in your blood. The AMA and other medical research oriented group s have not produced a single study that proves that p eople with high levels of cholesterol have more heart attacks than those with low levels. They have proved, however, that they can s ell billions of See Chapter 20, page 6 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"Heart Attacks, What Causes Them and the FDA Chapter 21 Page 9 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century dollars of cholesterol lowering drugs. Dr. Matthia s Rath has shown that the basis of heart attacks is vitamin deficien cy, mainly vitamin C. Get his books. Believe me. He has proven it. Vit amins prevent heart attacks, not cholesterol lowering drugs. Dr. Matthias Rath points out that there are several thousand miles of blood veins in your body. Those don’t clog up and cause problems. If cholesterol in the blood was causing problems, i t would cause problems throughout the body. Only the ten inches of veins right at the heart are affected by cholesterol. Now why wou ld that be? It’s because those veins at the heart are smashed flat a t every heart pump, like 70 or 80 times a minute, millions of ti mes a year. They fail not because they are clogged, but because the walls of the veins cannot take being flattened so many times, and they crack. Vitamin C is what causes the walls of blood vessels to be s trong. Scurvy is a vitamin C deficiency, and heart attack is part of t he same problem. The deposit on the walls of those particular veins is only to increase the strength and prevent the veins from being total ly flattened and not for the purpose of clogging the veins . When the vein cracks it stays flat instead of opening again and that is wha t is causing heart attacks. Vitamin C is what prevents heart attacks. Read Dr. Rath’s books, and be sure to buy some vitamin C. The phar maceutical companies definitely don’t want you to read his boo ks, because you won’t buy their cholesterol drugs. Cholesterol is the body’s response to a deficiency of vitamin C. The body seeks to strengthen the walls of the blood ves sels and prevent them from cracking by depositing the cholesterol. I should mention that Dr. Rath worked with Dr. Linu s Pauling for many years. Dr. Linus Pauling agreed with Dr. Rath ’s findings and they worked together to further verify and understa nd the use of vitamins in the body. Dr. Linus Pauling was the on ly man in history to receive two unshared Nobel prizes in the medical field. His agreement and help with these findings adds a great deal of credence to them.

If they cure the problem, they will not be able to continue selling drugs. It’s sorry, but the fact is that it is all based on money. Let’s first talk about Dr. William Frederic Koch. Dr. Koch developed a medicine from herbs which he called glyoxylide. He cured his first cancer patient in 1917 and thousands thereafter whe n you count what he did and what the other doctors did using hi s medicine. What do you think the conventional treatment for ca ncer was at that time? The treatment that had at that time already been in use for many years began more than 100 years ago. I’ll bet you couldn’t guess what it was in a hundred years. Well amazing as it may seem, it was x-ray and radium radiation, the same as it i s now. One hundred years and they are still using the same tre atment and guess what, more and more people are dying from cancer. Does anyone see anything wrong with the picture here? Don’t yo u think at some point or the other those responsible would say, “Ma ybe we ought to do a little research into an alternate idea?” No, they just go blithely on researching the same basic theory. It is the re sult of the pharmaceutical companies only making money availabl e for certain kinds of research that they know will get nowhere. Dr. Koch said that you don’t want to kill the cance r cells, you want to remover the virus that is causing the cell to be si ck and thus allow the cancer cell to return to normal. The FDA and FTC attacked Dr. Koch for years. He wa s driven from the U.S. and traveled to Brazil where he had phenom enal success treating advanced rheumatoid arthritis, insanity, d iabetes, cases of advanced cancer, and even leprosy. The FDA was ext remely alarmed and demanded that he return to the U.S. La ter when he did return he was arrested on trumped-up charges. Two trials were held and both times the jury acquitted Dr. Koch despite the fact that the judge would not allow a single cured patient to tes tify. The trials See Chapter 20, page 6 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"Heart Attacks, What Causes Them and the FDA Chapter 21 Page 11 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century went on from 1942 to 1946 and cost the government m ore than $10,000,000 which is the equivalent to $100,000,000 in present day money. They could not prove that Dr. Koch’d techno logy did not cure cancer, but by this time none of his herbs for his cure were available in the U.S. Colonel Charles March took over as head of the FTC and attempted to stop the attacks against Dr. Koch, but he met wi th a sudden and questionable death. Deaths of that nature in those times seem to happen to a number of people involved with alternat e medical treatment. That is not to say that such deaths do not happen now, because they do. A very good friend of mine, who d iscovered several cures for several important diseases went h ome about 5 years ago and a bomb in his apartment blew both of his le gs off. He lived, but the idea that they don’t stop people now days i s a lie. Although the FTC could not legally stop Dr. Koch fr om selling his medicine to doctors, they gave him a cease and desi st order from advertising in any way to doctors. This prevented doctors from knowing about it and from using it to treat cancer patients and other diseases. It is estimated that in excess of 100,00 0 patients were cured of cancer between the years of 1917 when Dr. Koch cured his first cancer patient until 1951 when the FTC ordere d him to stop advertising to doctors. His laboratories were unab le to stay in business without the sales. Recently there are tho se who have attempted to duplicate his formula, but he and most of those who knew the details are now dead. Basically this cure for cancer and many other diseases has been lost. Do you see why the MMS is so important at this time ? It is a medicine that can be used by anyone and everyone ca n know the formula. Once out, and once it has been tested wid ely by the public, none of the alphabet soup agencies (FDA, FTC, AMA m ostly) will have any way to stop it, and the pharmaceutical com panies will be up a creek. It will be the dawning of the end of t he tremendous cash flow for drugs that treat only the symptoms. If my strategy works and See Chapter 20, page 6 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"Heart Attacks, What Causes Them and the FDA Chapter 21 Page 12 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century it does get to the public, it will be the beginning of many books of the same nature by others. The end of the tremendous s uffering of mankind at the hands of medical and pharmaceutical people for money is in sight. With the Internet and modern te chnology, normal people can now know more than doctors used to know. We can no longer be kept in ignorance about medicine. The da wn of the age of information has already happened, but this is the d awn of the age of medical information to the average person. I hope it is. It is if you help. Had Dr. Koch’s cure been used by all doctors , literally millions of people would not have suffered and died. They w ould have lived happy lives. The other cancer-cure that I wanted to mention is t he one developed by Royal R. Rife of San Diego, California. He star ted research somewhat later than Dr. Koch, but in the same era. His research started in 1920. He began by inventing a microscop e that was quite different from the best standard microscopes. His best microscope had a magnification of 30,000, although his first o nes were not that powerful. The problem was that in the scientific f ield it is well known that the most powerful non electronic microscope ha d only 2,500 power. The theory of light prevents anything more powerful than that because at that power the light waves theoreti cally cannot be amplified any more. Rife, however, had his own theory of light microsco pes. The electronic microscope cannot be used with small vir uses because the light frequency that it uses destroys the virus. R ife built many really tremendous microscopes over his lifetime; each new one was better than the one before. His microscopes were duplicat ed and some still exist to this day. They were so powerful that they could reveal the viruses that caused cancer. The microscopes used s everal different light sources of different frequencies. His micros cope used the heterodyne principle of light frequency. That’s wh ere one frequency is converted to another frequency. This principle has been used in radio frequencies for many years and still is. Rif e just learned to use it with light frequencies. No reason why he should n’t, but his See Chapter 20, page 6 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"Heart Attacks, What Causes Them and the FDA Chapter 21 Page 13 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century microscopes were destroyed and his books and plans were burned. Despite that fact literally hundreds of doctors use d Rife’s microscopes to identify and verify cancer. The other thing that Rife did, after identifying th e cancer virus, was design a device that killed the cancer virus in pla cez? The theory that he used was simple and scientific. He used the the ory of radio antennas. It is not a hard basic theory to underst and. Each different frequency will cause a flow of electrical current i n an exact precise length of metal. So if you have a wire of the righ t length connected to your radio, you can pick up the frequency that c auses an electrical flow of current in that wire. You don’t see the wi re anymore in modern radios, but it’s there somewhere. So Rife figured, “We know that those little fellows can conduct electricity, so why not make a radio antenna out of them.” He decided that all he needed to do was measure their size and then calculate the frequency that would cause an electri cal current to flow in them the same as a TV or radio antenna. If he c ould cause an electrical current to flow in them that would kill them. A special Research Committee of the University of Southern Ca lifornia oversaw his laboratory work until the end of the 19 30's. Follow-up clinics conducted in 1935, 1936 and 1937 by the hea d of the U.S.C. Medical Committee verified the results that he was getting. Independent physicians, utilizing machines that wer e duplicates of Rife’s machine, successfully treated as many as 40 patients per day. A number of doctors continued to treat patients for up to 22 years, but the pressure became too great. When authoritie s found a machine in operation they either destroyed it on th e spot or confiscate it for evidence. Rife determined the precise frequency for herpes, t uberculosis, and other illnesses as well as cancer. His work was in Science magazines, medical journals, and later the Smithsonian Institu tion’s annual report. Thousands were cured during the 1930's, an d then the authorities struck. Rife began working with John C rane, and See Chapter 20, page 6 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"Heart Attacks, What Causes Them and the FDA Chapter 21 Page 14 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century engineer. Rife’s life work was in John Crane’s lab when the authorities hit it. They destroyed everything, bur ned books and jailed John Crane. After that there were continuou s problems with the authorities. The University no longer backed R ife and he simply had to quit. Today there are numerous people throughout the worl d that have Rife frequency generators. Many do not work as the y do not duplicate Rife’s work closely enough, but many do w ork and cancer and other diseases are still cured with these frequ ency generators. There are even a few people who have his microscope s or good duplicates of his microscopes. They still work. The question is, how were these people stopped when they were curing people? How was the truth covered over so e asily? There are two reasons. Both were greed. There were scientis ts who did not want their theories of cancer and other diseases qu estioned and there were the pharmaceutical companies who did not want their incomes decreased. Billions of dollars can exert huge amou nts of pressure. The medical laws of this country have been shaped b y the pharmaceutical companies. They have spent billions of dollars with at least two lawyers in Washington, D.C. for each r epresentative and each senator. It all boils down to money, but the criminality of it is beyond belief. Millions suffer and die so that the y can make money, and there was another reason. Many of the medical scientists were pushing their own favorite concepts that made then well known and they were mostly in with the pharmaceutical compani es. That also boils down to money. Hundreds of very important industries exist in the United States that do not spend billions of dollars influence Congress on making laws. There is no acceptable reason for the drug companie s to be spending that huge amount of money to influence congress, bu t they do. You can check my accuracy in these statements by go ing on the Internet and reading some of the thousands of docum ents that are See Chapter 20, page 6 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"Heart Attacks, What Causes Them and the FDA Chapter 21 Page 15 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century available.

Ask any person interested in health. Medical drugs treat symptoms and all of the medical research by pharmaceutical companies is dir ected towards treating symptoms, and not towards finding the caus e of the problem. Well, the reason is that if you find the c ause of a disease or health problem you can usually cure the problem. I n that case you cannot continue to sell the drug over and over unti l the person dies. Billions of dollars are involved. Treating symptom s does not cure or change the problem. Why do you reason that there h as been no significant advancement in Cancer technology in 100 years? With one or two minor exceptions the same treatments are still used, more than 100 years later. The world has advance fantas tically in almost everything but cancer treatment and other disease t reatments.

He or his coworkers would on occasion contract malaria. At times access to mo dern medical treatment was absolutely unavailable. Under such di re circumstances it was found that a solution useful to sanitize dri nking water was also effective to treat malaria if diluted and taken ora lly. Despite no formal medical training Mr. Humble had the innate wisdom t o experiment with various dosage and administration techniques.

In terms of milligrams of sodium chlorite, this calculates out to 9mg per drop or 54mg to 135mg per treatment. Effectiveness is enhanced, if prior to administrati on the selected drops are premixed with 2.5 to 5 cc of table vinega r or lime juice and allowed to react for 3 minutes. The acidified solut ion is then mixed into a glass of water or apple juice and taken oral ly. This can be taken on an empty stomach to enhance effectiveness but this often causes nausea.

It is well known that many disease causing organisms are sensi tive to oxidants. Various compounds classifiable as oxides of chlorine such as sodium hypochlorite and chlorine dioxide are alr eady widely used as disinfectants. What is novel and exciting here i s that Mr. Humble's technique seems: 1) easy to use, 2) rapidly acting, 3) successful, 4) apparently lacking in toxicity, and 5) affordable. If this treatment continues to prove effective, it could be used to h elp rid the world of one of the most devastating of all known plagues. [ 1,2] Especially moving in me is the empathy I feel for anyone with a debilitating febrile illness. I cannot forget how horrible I fee l whenever I have caught influenza. How much more miserable it must b e to suffer like that again and again every 2 to 3 days as happens i n malaria. Millions of people suffer this way year round. 1 to 3 million die from malaria every year mostly children. Thus motivated I sought to learn all I could about the chemistry of the oxides of ch lorine. I wanted to understand their probable mechanisms of toxicity to wards the causative agents of malaria (Plasmodium species). [ 3] I wanted to check available literature pertaining to issues of safety or risk in human use. References: 1. Current status of malaria control.

Examples are: hydrogen peroxide, z inc peroxide, various quinones, various glyoxals, ozone, ultravio let light, hyperbaric oxygen, benzoyl peroxide, artemisinin, m ethylene blue, allicin, iodine and permanganate. I had taught at n umerous seminars on their use and explained their mechanisms of acti on on the biochemical level. Oxidants are atoms or molecules which take up electrons. Reductants are atoms or molecules which donate electrons to oxidants. Low dose oxidant exposure to living red blood cells induces a change in oxyhemoglobin (Hb-O2) activity so that more oxyg en (O2) is released to tissues throughout the body. [1] Hyperb aric oxygenation (oxygen under pressure): 1) is a powerful detoxifie r against carbon monoxide; 2) is a powerful support for natural heal ing in burns, crush injuries, and ischemic strokes; and 3) is an effect ive aid to treat most bacterial infections. Taken internally, intermittently and in low doses m any oxidants have been found to be powerful immune stimulants. Exposu re of live blood to ultraviolet light has similar immune enhan cing effects. These treatments work through a natural physiologic trigg er mechanism, which induces peripheral white blood cells to expre ss and to release cytokines. These cytokines serve as an alarm system to increase cellular attack against pathogens and to down-regul ate allergic reactions. Activated cells of the immune system naturally prod uce strong oxidants as part of the inflammatory process at sit es of infection or cancer to rid the body of these diseases. One such natural defense oxidant is hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Another is per oxynitrate (-OONO) the coupled product of superoxide (*OO-) an d nitric oxide (*NO) radicals. Yet another is hypochlorous acid (H OCl) the conjugate acid of sodium hypochlorite (NaClO).

[4, 11, 12, 13, 28] All bacteria have been shown to be incapabl e of growing in any medium in which the oxidants (electron grabbers ) out-number the reductants (electron donors). [29] Thus oxidant s are at least bacteriostatic and at most are bactericidal. [27] S ome oxidants such as iodine, various peroxides, or permanganate are a pplied topically to the skin to treat or to prevent infections cause d by bacteria or fungi. Chlorine dioxide has been similarly used. [1 5] Hypochlorites (ClO-) are commonly used as bleaching agents, as swimming pool sanitizers, and as disinfectants. Chl orine dioxide (ClO2) as well as ozone (O3) are effective disinfec tants for public water supplies and are often used for that purpose. [9,14] Sodium chlorite (NaClO2) solutions have long been used as mouth washes to rapidly clear mouth odors and oral bacteria. Acidif ied sodium chlorite is FDA approved as a spray in the meat packing indu stry to sanitized meat. [1, 2, 8, 10, 26] Farmers use this to cleanse the udders of cows to prevent mastitis, [5, 6, 7] and to rid eggs of p athogenic bacteria. Chlorine dioxide kills many viruses. [16, 17, 18, 1 9, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25] Acidified sodium chlorite is even useful to sanitize vegetables. [3] Some work has been done using dilute solutions of sodium chlorite internally to treat fungal infections, chr onic fatigue, and cancer. Little however has been published in that r egard.

Minnetonka, Minnesota 29. OXIDATION-REDUCTION POTENTIALS IN BACTERIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY L F Hewitt, 6th Ed, E. & S. Livingston Ltd., 1950 MALARIA IS OXIDANT SENSITIVE >From November 2006 through May of 2007 I spent hun dreds of hours searching biochemical literature and medical literature pertaining to the biochemistry of Plasmodia. Four s pecies are commonly pathogenic in humans namely: Plasmodium vi vax, Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium ovale and Plasmod ium malariae. What I found was an abundance of confirma tion that, just like bacteria, Plasmodia are indeed quite sensitive to oxidants. [15] Examples of oxidants toxic to Plasmodia include: ar temisinin [16, 27, 36, 41], atovaquone [48], menadione, and methylene blue [29,47]. Also like bacteria and tumor cells, the ability of Plasmodia to live and grow depends heavily on an internal abundance of th iol compounds [38,55]. Thiols are also known as sulfhydryl compou nds (RSH). Thiols as a class behave as reductants (electron do nors). Thus they are notoriously sensitive to oxidation and they are rapidly reactive with oxides of chlorine. This includes sodium chlor ite (NaClO2) and chlorine dioxide (ClO2) the very agents present in Mr. Humble's solution. The products of oxidation of thiols using various oxides of chlorine are: disulfides (RSSR), disulfide monoxide s (RSSOR), sulfenic acids (RSOH), sulfinic acids (RSO2H), and sulfonic acids (RSO3H). None of these can support the life process es of the parasite. Upon sufficient removal of the parasite's life sustaining thiols by oxidation, the parasite rapidly dies. A list of thiols (RSH) upon which survival of Plasmodium species heavily depend includes: lipoic acid & dihydrolipoic acid [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11 ], coenzyme A & acyl carrier protein [6, 9, 12, 39, 43], glutathion e [4, 19, 26, 32, 35, 37], glutathione reductase [33, 34, 42], glutathion e-S-transferase [24, 30, 49, 50, 52, 53], peroxiredoxin [40, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 65, 66, 67], thioredoxin [20, 21, 22, 25, 44, 6 4], glutaredoxin [31,45], plasmoredoxin [28], thioredoxin reductase [23, 46], ornithine decarboxylase and falcipain [13,14,17,18, 51,54].

Rahlfs S, Becker K Eur J Biochem. 2001 Mar; 268(5):1404-9 HEME IS AN OXIDANT SENSITIZER Of particular relevance to treating malaria is the fact that Plasmodial trophozoites living inside red blood cells must dig est hemoglobin as their preferred protein source. [8, 13] They accomp lish this by ingesting hemoglobin into an organelle known as the \"acid food vacuole\". [3, 16] Incidently, the high concentratio n of acid in this organelle could serve as an additional site of conv ersion of chlorite (ClO2-) to the more active chlorine dioxide (ClO2) right inside the parasite. Next falcipain (a hemoglobin digesting enzyme) hydr olyzes hemoglobin protein to release its nutritional amino acids. [4, 5, 6, 26, 27] A necessary byproduct of this digestion is the release of 4 heme molecules from each hemoglobin molecule digested. [ 1] Free heme (also known as ferriprotoporphyrin) is redox active and can react with ambient oxygen (O2), an abundance of which is always present in red blood cells. This produces superoxide radica l (*OO-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and other reactive oxidant toxic species. [2, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 20] These can rapidly poison the parasite internally. To protect itself against this dangerous side-effec t of eating blood protein, Plasmodia must continuously and rapidly el iminate heme. [18, 22] This is accomplished by two methods. First ly, heme is"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"Thomas Lee Hesselink, MD An Overview 15 polymerized producing hemozoin. [19, 21, 23, 24] Se condly, heme is metabolized in a detoxification process that requir es reduced glutathione (GSH). [17, 25] Therefore any method (i ncluding exposure to oxidants) which limits the availability of reduced glutathione will cause a toxic build up of heme ins ide the parasite cells. Since sodium chlorite and chlorine dioxide r eadily oxidize glutathione heme detoxification is inhibited. As th ese are the exact agents used in Mr. Humble's treatment, the observed effect of killing Plasmodia should be expected. References: 1.

Q uinine, chloroquine, mefloquine and other quinoline antibio tics all work by blocking the heme detoxifying system inside the tro phozoites. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] Many Plasmodial strains against which quin olines have"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"Thomas Lee Hesselink, MD An Overview 18 repeatedly been used have found a way to adjust to this treatment and to acquire resistance. Recent research has show n, however, that the mechanism of this acquired resistance amounts t o a mere upregulation of glutathione production and utilizat ion. [6, 7, 8, 11, 19, 21, 22, 23] Recent research has also shown that oxidizing or otherwise depleting glutathione inside the parasite restores sensitivity to the quinoline antibiotics. [10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 20] Therefore, some protocols combining the use of oxidants with q uinolines are already showing signs of success. In this regard le t us consider that no amount of intraplasmodial glutathione (GSH) could e ver resist exposure to a sufficient dose of chlorine dioxide ( ClO2). Note that each molecule of ClO2 can disable 5 molecules of gl utathione. 10 GSH + 2 ClO2 -> 5 GSSG + 4 H2O + 2 HCl Living things possess a recovery system to rescue o xidized sulfur compounds. It operates through donation of hydrogen atoms to these compounds and thereby restores their original condition as thiols. [9] 2 [H] + GSSG -> 2 GSH A key player in th is system is the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate- dehydrogenase (G6PD H). Patients with a genetic defect of G6PDH, known as glucose-6- phosphate- dehydrogenase deficiency disease, are especially se nsitive to oxidants and to prooxidant drugs. However, this genetic dise ase has a benefit in that such individuals are naturally resistant to malaria. They can still catch malaria, but it is much less severe in them, since they permanently lack the enzyme necessary to assist the parasite in reactivating glutathione. [14, 17] Furthermore, G6PDH is profoundly sensitive to inhib ition by sodium chlorate (NaClO3), another member of the chlorine o xide family of compounds. Sodium chlorate (NaClO3) is a lesser ing redient present in Jim Humble's antimalarial solution. Some sodium chlorate should also be produced in vivo by a slow reaction of chor ine dioxide with water under slightly alkaline conditions. The Plasm odia may attempt to restore its glutathione that is lost to oxidatio n. However, this will be difficult or impossible if G6PDH is inhibited by chlorate. Rerences: 1.

Other mechanisms of toxicity of the oxides of chlorine against Plasmodia should also be considered. Oxides of chlorine are generally rapidly reactive w ith ferrous iron (Fe++). This explains why in cases of overdosed exp osures to oxides of chlorine such as sodium chlorite (NaClO2) there was a"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"Thomas Lee Hesselink, MD An Overview 22 notable rise in methemoglobin levels. Methemoglobin is a metabolically inactive form of hemoglobin in which its ferrous iron (Fe++) cofactor has been oxidized to ferric (Fe+++) . Many enzymes in living things employ iron as a cofactor including those in parasites. [8, 9, 10] Thus it is reasonable to expe ct that any damage to Plasmodia caused by oxides of chlorine is compou nded by conversion of ferrous cofactors to ferric.

[2] When these are lacking pathogens quit growing and die. [1] Polyami nes are also sensitive to oxidation and can be eliminated by str ong oxidants. When oxidized, polyamines are converted to aldehyde s, which are deadly to parasites and to tumors. Thus any procedu re which is successful to oxidize polyamines does double damage to the pathogen. Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) is known to be es pecially reactive against secondary amines. This includes spermine an d spermidine, the two main biologically important polyamines. References: 1.

Bachrach U, Abu-Elheiga L, Assaraf YG, Golenser J, Spira DT Adv Exp Med Biol. 1988;250:643-50 SAFETY ISSUES A remaining concern is safety. So far, at least ane cdotally, the dosages of chlorine oxides as administered orally p er Jim Humble's protocol have produced no definite toxicity. Some h ave taken this as often as 1 to 3 times weekly and on the surface see m to suffer no ill effects. To be certain if this is safe, more resear ch is warranted for such long term or repeated use. The concern is that too much or too frequent administration of oxidants could excessive ly deplete the body's reductants and promote oxidative stress. One useful way to monitor this may be to periodically check methemogl obin levels in frequent users. Sodium chlorite, as found in munici pal water supplies after disinfection by chorine dioxide, has been stu died and proven safe. Animal studies using yet higher oral doses ha ve also proven safe. One case of extreme overdose in a suicide att empt caused nearly fatal kidney failure and refractory methemog lobinemia. Special precautions must be employed in cases of gl ucose-6- phosphate-dehydrogenase deficiency disease, as thes e patients are especially sensitive to oxidants of all kinds. Neve rtheless, oral sodium chlorite (NaClO2) solutions may yet be found safe a nd effective in them, but probably will need to be administered at lower doses. MORE RESEARCH It is hoped that this overview will spark a flurry of interest, and stimulate more research into the use of acidified s odium chlorite in the treatment of malaria. The above appreciated obs ervations need to be proven more rigorously and published [8]. The biochemistry most likely involved suggests that other members of the phylum Apicomplexa should also be sensitive to this treatm ent. This phylum includes: Plasmodium, Babesia, Toxoplasma [2], Cryp tosporidium [3], Eimeria [4], Theileria, Sarcocystis, Cyclospor a, Isospora and Neospora. These agents are responsible for widespre ad diseases in humans, pets and cattle. Chlorine dioxide has been proven to be cidal to alm ost all known infectious agents in vitro using remarkably low con centrations. This includes parasites [1, 6, 7, 9, 10], fungi [5], bac teria and viruses. The"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"Thomas Lee Hesselink, MD An Overview 25 experiences noted above imply that this compound is tolerable orally at effective concentrations.

Well, read this: I’m an elementary school teacher in Hermosillo Mexico in the state of Sonora. My name is Clara Be ltrones. I first started using the MMS on May 25 of this year. My youngest daughter’s tonsils became swollen with white spots on them. I took her to the doctor and he prescribed penicillin and anti- inflammatory drops which I gave to her when we retu rned home. Within ½ hour her whole body started to swell with spots similar to those on her tonsils and she had problems breathing. I took her back to the sam e doctor who gave her a shot to bring the swelling down. I brought her home and in an hour nothing had happened. So I called Jim Humble and he said give her one drop of MMS and then another drop an hour later. In the first 15 m inutes of the first dose the swelling of her body went back to normal. I took h er back to the doctor as I wanted him to see what was going on in her body. T he doctor asked what I gave her, because the tonsils were half way down and the spots were gone. I decided not to say anything to the doctor. I came back hom e and gave her the second drop. This happened during the morning and by that afternoon she was back to normal except she had a runny nose. The next day s he was completely clear. Even though I saw it work on my daughter I was stil l disbelieving of the MMS. However, on June 17 my aunt Patty Velez and her dau ghter Patty Souza came to see me and I thought to give it to them just to try it out. I then gave both of them six drops of MMS with the necessary lime drops and the 3 minute wait. When they drank it they both mentioned that they felt tinglin g in their whole body in about fifteen minutes. We waited an hour and they took a second dose of 6 drops. At that time they went home. The next day I called to find out how they were doi ng. They pointed out that the daughter, Patty Souaza, had not had her period for six months, plus she had not yet developed breasts. She had a large chest, but no breasts had shown. Yet, that morning breasts about the size of a small lime had begun to develop. At that time I suggested the daughter take another dose on Thursda y which was 4 days later. When I called on Thursday she mentioned that her la rge chest had formed into full size breasts and she now had her period for the fir st time in six months. She now says that she feels less nervous and that she is lo sing a lot of the weight that she See Chapter 20, page 6 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"The MMS Adventures of a Grade School Teacher in Mex ico Chapter 23 Page 2 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century needs to lose. She was taking pills from a psychia trist for depression which she no long feels that she needs to take. Her mother also experienced change. She said that she felt much energized and for the first time she was able to sleep through the whole night. She mentioned that she was taking pill s prescribed by a psychiatrist for depression and anxiety and pills to go to sleep and pills to wake up in the morning. The first night she was able to sleep and did not take the pills. The second day the back pain and leg pain that she had been experiencing for many years was gone. She also stopped taking the pills for depression and anxiety because she no longer needs them. She is a nurse a nd understands the need or no need for such pills. It’s now two months later and both the mother and daughter are still doing well. On June 26 my daughter Alejandra age 5 woke up very swollen in her entire body. She could hardly see out of her eyes. She had a pa in on her lower right side of her stomach and she was throwing up because of the extr eme pain. I took her to the emergency room and they admitted her and did a bloo d test, urine test, and X-rays and all came out positive to acute appendicitis. Th ey began to program her for an operation immediately as an emergency. I decided t o see about having her operation at a local private hospital. They starte d doing the paperwork for the transfer; in the meantime she was in observation. I went to the car, got my bottle of MMS and a lime that I had thought to bring in th e car in case I might need it, and prepared her a 6 drop dose. I had her drink it like she was drinking a glass of water. The doctor noticed that the swelling on he r body began to reduce and the pain was almost gone in about 20 minutes. So they kept her in observation and after 3 hours of paper work and observation there w as no longer any swelling or pain. So the doctor asked me if I gave her anythin g and I said nothing. He asked several times but knowing doctors I decided it best to say nothing. The doctor decided to have another set of tests. The blood te st, urine test, and the X-rays all came out negative for appendicitis. I asked for th e results of the tests, but the doctor would only allow me to have the second set o f tests which I now have at home. When we came home she had a severe pain in h er stomach and she run to the restroom and had much water and green stuff com e out. That was the end of it. I did not give her a second dose. On July 6 I visited Liz Chan who complained of back pain, leg pain, and that she has not been able to sit down because she gets cram ps in her legs. She has had the cramp problem since she was 18 when she had her tonsils removed. At that time she began having 1rheumatoid arthritis and var icose veins. So I decided to give her six drops with the lime and 3 minutes wait and then a similar dose after one hour. After the first dose in about 15 minutes her lower back pain went away and she was able to sit down and stand up with no p roblem. The next morning she called and said she had no pain and she was abl e to sit up with no problem. She was amazed with the results. On the third day of taking the six drops each See Chapter 20, page 6 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"The MMS Adventures of a Grade School Teacher in Mex ico Chapter 23 Page 3 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century night her varicose veins were still the same size b ut the pain was gone. She felt a lot of energy. On August 8 she told me she had los t 10 pounds of weight and on August 9 th she got diarrhea for a whole day and I had her tak e lemon aid and salt to overcome any dehydration. On August 10 she went camping and she was able to walk over 4 miles without pain or tiring. Durin g the process she noticed that the fungus that had been on the bottom of her foot for over 5 years had disappeared. She also feels that her skin is in much better cond ition. Also she has noticed that all cramping before her period is now gone. Martha, a lady that owns a small grocery store near my house one morning complained about a pain in the neck caused by lying wrong. I had her come to my house and gave her the two six drop doses at one ho ur between each dose. The pain in her neck went away on the first dose. Now she keeps a MMS bottle in her store and treats people in the neighborhood and tho se who bring products to the store. For example, one person who had a tooth ach e she had him wash his mouth with 15 drops of MMS, activated with lime, th e 3 wait and with water added. The pain went away immediately. She began treating her mother who suffers from emphysema. The disease was so bad tha t the doctors could give her no hope. She also has rheumatoid arthritis. When I saw her the first time she was laying with oxygen and not able to move. On the fi rst dose of 6 drops she vomited white stuff. With the second dose after an hour sh e felt OK and went to sleep with no need for oxygen. The next day she felt so good that she wanted to go out side. She was able to get up from bed with no help. Ther e was still pain but it was less than 50% of what it was according to her evaluation . On the third day it was raining and yet the pain was even less and she was able to walk around the house with the help of a walker. She takes the 6 drops e very night and now she plans to start increasing the number of drops. It is now 8 days later, and she has said what she likes about the drops is that they make her vom it a lot of mucus every other day and that she always feels much better after vom iting. Now she only uses oxygen now and then. Martha (the daughter) persona lly takes drops every time she feels nervous and anxious and that calms her do wn right away. My mother suffered from both acid reflux and hemorr hoids which caused her lower intestines to become inflamed for many years. The first time she took the MMS she took a full 15 drops with the vinegar instead of li me. She said she felt nothing from the drops, but the second day she got diarrhea and she took another 15 drops. She vomited for about 3 hours and the only thing sh e took was lemonade with salt to hydrate her body. She felt very week. The thir d day she didn’t take any drops but she felt good with a lot of energy. She was afr aid to eat, but she did eat a little fruit for breakfast, and nothing for lunch. At din ner she went ahead and had a stake with a lot of salza. She had no problem with digestion and she noticed no burning problem. After that she took 6 drops for a bout 2 months and one day she decided that she needed to clean herself out. She t hen went to 10 drops and then to 11 drops and then she began vomiting bright oran ge material and she felt weak See Chapter 20, page 6 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"The MMS Adventures of a Grade School Teacher in Mex ico Chapter 23 Page 4 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century and remained in bed with diarrhea. The next day sh e took 12 drops and after an hour she threw up dark green material only 4 times that day. Finally the throw up material was orange again and she began feeling bet ter and had one meal. On the third day she awoke feeling really great with lots of energy and has been feeling good ever since. She continues to take the MMS and she has lost 6 pounds so far. Her stomach is much smaller in size now. There’s one other case I would like to tell you abo ut. My son, Carlos, who is 12 years old has had Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) all of his life. I have always paid to have him attend special schools. This year the tuition is $2000 US. A cost not easily obtained in Mexico. The ADD often come s with poor conduct and poor social abilities. And that was especially in the c ase with Carlos. It was hard for me, his mother, to keep him doing his chores. He did n ot get along with the other children and he was what I considered a continuous problem. And then one evening a couple of months ago I started him off, t he same as everyone else, with a 6 drop dose, of course with the lemon juice, three minute wait and then added juice. He took the second similar dose one hour la ter, and has been taking 6 drop doses every evening. After about two weeks his att itude began to change. He began being nicer to me, and to the other children. There has been no fighting incidents and Carlos has become a very well behaved child and seem quite appreciative of other people. He hasn’t started to school yet, but I am anxious to see how his grades will be. -- I hope you have as good results as I have had. Clara Beltrones. Note from the Author: As you can see here Clara has been using a little different protocol than I have suggested in this book in that I usually suggest starting at 2 drops of MMS or less. However, it is hard to argue with success. Clara has now treated more than 45 people using the six drop first dose and she always waits an hour before giving them a second dose. In discussing th e cases with her, she almost always notices quite a bit of burping wi thin 15 minutes or so. Most of the people here in this desert city of Hermosillo vomit white or colored mucus within the first several hou rs, often after they go home from taking the two 6 drop doses. She alwa ys warns them that they will probably vomit at first and so far t hey have all agreed to go ahead and take the 6 drop doses. All the cases that Clara has treated has reported feeling really great, or bette r than they have felt for years. There has been a positive result from ev eryone, and many of them have gotten positive results with their lov ed ones. See Chapter 20, page 6 for data on obtaining MMS."},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"The MMS Adventures of a Grade School Teacher in Mex ico Chapter 23 Page 5 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century Clara mentioned that when she uses 18 drops of lemo n juice with the 6 drops of MMS it takes several hours longer to get to the point of vomiting than it does if she gives them 30 drops of lemon juice which is 1/3 more. With 30 drops they seem to vomit much sooner. She prefers the 18 drops. At this time I am not changing my suggested protoco l of starting with 2 drops or even 1 drop, however, I thought you woul d be interested in the results that Clara is getting. With my sugg estion of starting with 2 drops the person seems to clear up much slower, b ut it seems to be just as effective over a longer period of time with less vomiting. However, it seems that many people consider vomitin g and diarrhea an indication that something positive is happening and it usually is. Good luck.
